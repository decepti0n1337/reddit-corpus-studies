Where do you buy them?

Listen bud, when I show up to do that event at Sons of  *DANE, I'm going to make sure the juke box is on the whole time cause I'd like to complete the event and move on as soon as possible. If you're the only person there and you choose to just farm like that, then cool, do you. Just don't be surprised once people start showing up and keep turning the juke box on and/or start using the instrumental weapons.
---
It must be. I have TSE lever and it’s ok.  But my quad lever does more for me. But maybe I’m in the minority. 
---
And that’s what happens kids when you go to mushrooms, class dismissed 
---
He seemed like kind of a punk.  Idk if anyone would want to hire a bodyguard like that.  You'll see when I post the video.
---
Probably trolls. There’s little reason to see devs online and playing. 
---
Oh, good call
---
I always put stuff in the ice machine in front the Whitesprings golf course clubhouse. I am where I am in this game because of random acts of kindness. So, I try to do the same. I was trying to trade with a guy in his base today. Dude got made I wouldnt come off of the weapons he wanted then tried to kill me and then locked me in his base. I wrecked every single thing I could then server hopped and messaged a low guy I played with earlier to come and kill me. Dude got a stack of caps for almost nothing
---
Great post, fun read for sure. Nice to know there are some guardians out there in the wasteland
---
Great tips, everyone! These will really help survive the nuke zone. Keep 'em coming. 
---
How dare you! She only had explosive diarrhea that one time! 
---
I don’t like people touching my shit 
---
Because this game is a 5/10 at BEST, quit after lvl 106.  It has potential and I want to see it fixed but honestly overall it's trash from launch and still trash now.  
---
I have about 850 hours now. It helps having people to play with. I run my own community of around 40 players on ps4. I regularly play with 6 or so of these players. 
---

---
When the Queen was farm-able it was a lot easier to spend a lot of time running silo's and killing her. 
---
I personally am waiting for Path of Excile to come out for PS4 so i have something to play while i wait for updates. 
---
No one wipes their feet
---
Thanks!
---
In fact, imagine you are in the center of a nuke zone and you see two guys standing there. One has power armor.  One doesn't (no hazmat suit either). They both stay there. Which one of them you are afraid of more?
---
Making our own cola would be so nice
---
Sounds like a good story in the wasteland. I love writing about adventures that i experience in the wasteland with other players.
---
I envy you on your experience. It sounds like a nice story already.
---
Why did he attack the lvl 40 dude? Isn't he supposed to be defenfing? Wouldn't instigating problems be out of the description? 
---
No one ever brings a home warming gift. 
---
Yeah it's too bad.  The only way it makes sense is if you're not using the hunting rifle and need something to burn your extra 308 off with.
---
Idk.  It seemed he might have accidentally attacked him earlier.  When I showed up they were both looking at their pip boys near a Mr messenger bot, so I started playing the mortal kombat theme song and he just started whacking the guy.
---
I saw one among a group of mutants fighting an alpha male deathclaw somewhere near harper's ferry. He blew himself up but I could still grab two mini nukes off his body. Level 170 or so, haven't played in a while but I think it was around there
---
I just don't know, my crafting stuff is outside of my home, but inside, its locked... I don't really know why : / I guess it is by habit

Lmao!!!!

What I love is those who say something like, "You couldn't pay me to play that trash", meaning they haven't actually played the game but toss their opinion in anyways.
---
Quad automatic handmade with faster strafe speed and faster fire rate. For larger crowds, I like hopping around with my quad automatic tesla rifle and nuking everything. Last resort is a two shot faster fire rate gatling gun. I also have a TSE the dragon for sniping off tanky enemies like mutant warlords or sentry bots.
---
mine doesnt even have a door, people just never visit so it doesnt matter to me
---
Because hoards of enemies, like scorched, can open unlocked doors
---
Around fissure prime or the fissure next to it will produce a lot of violet as it turns mutated fern into flash fern and there's load around the trees. Either drop a bomb yourself or do a spot of server hopping til you land one that's already been nuked. It does start the scorched earth event but once that's over you're free to farm. There's the odd bat to deal with but mostly scorched and super mutants that drop a nice amount of mass/fluids. Depending on the blast zone I normally get between 100-200 raw violet. 
---
Probably just griefers trying to find your camp. They would say anything to find your little clam shell. Lol
---
It's possible, but unlikely, they'd identify themselves as such..
---
Yeah, ils an online game with quite unstable servers. Happens to me sometimes 
---
The cap limit is a deliberate game design choice by the developers. Why the hell would they then allow you to store them in your stash to get around that limit?
---
It's in the enclave bunker in the Medical Center area
---
This is the real reason. They will walk right inside when you aren’t around.
---
It all depends on the server. Some are really old and glitchy. It depends on the people and if they have crazy inventories. I don’t really have a problem with it. It also may be internet speed or console you’re on
---
I have my main house unlocked, but can hit a switch inside to lock it up if I want to. The only time this is ever really useful though is the rare occasion that I'm trying to regroup from a random enemy or such. I do have one section that I  keep locked up so that low levels don't hurt or kill themselves ( room has switches for pyrotechnics on my stage, electric chair, entrance etc, and I use traps for that). Don't know any real reason to lock up benches and such though.
---
Well, there is a lot that has been going on. I mean, it would take too much time to say but the best way of seeing it is by playing normally the game without quests
---
See universally if you are holding per say 25 k , you could start buying pins and eventually sell them for a cap 
---
Marsupial would be great if you have it?
---
Hey, at least you CAN finish it. Mine bugged out during the PC beta, and then I never got the quest back on my character. Had just one left and it just vanished. So, you know, I'm just a little salty. 
---
Hell yeah, high five! (Mutual slicing of hands occurs)
---
Dude same, I saw Nuka Dark and thought wtf is that? And proceeded to find about Wild and even Grape 
---
I do PSN? 
---
Blaketopia. Thanks :)
---
Is that true?  I need screws so bad and I sold/scrapped so many of those...
---
I've seen something similar with armor - if it breaks and you don't de-equip it, it still gives you the armor, as far as I can tell.
---
The severs have gotten A LOT better and there new content dropping on the 12 of March which will last until May 23,you can check the road map on Twitter.
---
I thought I ran into the Pied Piper when I came across a robot leading a gang of cats. I wanted to tame a cat, but I guess you can't. Thanks Bethesda. I want a frigging cat!
---
Why did I get notified about this? I don’t even play this game anymore, it’s boring ass hell.
---
I have 3* berzerk reduced weight limb dmg gamma gun, also unyielding cavalier +strength combat right arm.  Looking for BE combat shotty. 
---
Always fun to read people helping out other players like this, especially when they can weave it into an awesome tale like this.
---
Because no one shuts the damn door! I come home to mole rats eating my furniture because some heathen didn't shut the door. So now it's locked. 
---
People will literally destroy your base because they can. I got tired of using my copper/crystal/etc to rebuild. That's just me. And yes I understand they can destroy my door,but they can't be inside waiting for me either.
---
Bethesda has nothing to do with this sub, other than their community managers posting on here to interact with the community.
---
And also, there's plenty of talking shit on the game that goes on here...so I don't really know what you're going on about.
---
Can you buy them for caps?
---
I almost died of thirst once trying to complete Gragnok and the Ruby Ruins! 
---
Ok thank you 
---
I leave mine open all the time.  Then one day I walked in and someone had put a bearskin rug and a piano in my house. Loved it. I like helping so I always will leave it unlocked.
---
It is glitched, yes. Something a 76 *player* would know.
---
Your server was full, are you able to join mine at all?
---
Yeah I’ll join right after trade

Has a slight burning sensation but overall you get used to it. Do direct taste tho.

My camp is never locked and is in a high traffic area. I love being elsewhere, checking the map, and seeing players in my camp. I always hope they're using the workbenches, harvesting crops, taking some purified water and maybe playing some music. 
---
Makes me happy.
---
What a sad and lonely douch you are.

Vampire War Drum.
---
I mean I have like 80 to a 100 hours but that's about it and i feel comfortable nothing really tests my damage or anything so I don't bother min maxing and all that 
---
Why do you sit here bitching about people who have issues with the game? Life is short, there's so many better things you can do with your time. 
---
See how stupid you sound, now?
---
Those are the only games I play pretty much lol but this game has no true test of power so it feels pointless 
---
Hit the one on roof of dropsite v9 for good measure. 
---
AND the free dlc’s start rolling out on the 12th, I am PUMPED!!
---
I’ll take a look, but I do t understand your meaning, the content only lasts from March to May? Or they’re releasing a stream of content during that time?
---
Last time I played we were having rolling shutdowns and I couldn’t damage enemies with guns, meanwhile a level 22 one hit me with a Bowie while I’m in full enclave pa at plus lvl 120.
---
Go from 4 to 3 or nv, its a revalation to behold when you realise everything wasnt a bullet sponge even at lower levels.
---
Maybe? Not holding my breath.
---
Keep your build just use the medic perk for extra stimpack healing and fireproof to reduce scorchbeast attacks to nothing
---
I have a dear friend who is on disability and is basically indigent. Video games help fill the hours for very little money overall

I played Tale of Two Wastelands after F4 it was a minute but I love the guns in Ttw especially the sub machine guns

Videogames isn't really my question it's this game specifically I have almost 3000 hours in eso since launch so I get that

I have a downstairs area that has beds, all crafting benches, food and water.

Champion! Thanks heaps :)
---
Did have a lever and a powder but the loading time annoyed me, I like the immediacy of melee knives and such unless the melee swing freezes or lags out which happens allot lately.
---
So whoever claims the FO76 sub “first” starts it all? Could it be anyone?
---
Hell yeah
---
Shit, really? So I'm not doing it wrong, SBs are just going to be bullet sponges from now on huh? Well, at least that sounds less painful than completely upending my build. Thanks. 
---
Radaway, a powerful weapon, stimpacks. I use the perk card that regenerates health as you get irradiated.
---
What's your lvl, build, and rp?
---
Uts a fucking joke, guys. Chill out with the downvotes.
---
Mines all locked up, but I usually leave an aesthetic hole in the wall
---
I am playing a melee build since the start, with instigating / 40% add. Power attack dmg, 2 handed weapons. Which have 400-500 base dmg and hit 1000+ on the first hit, basically 1 hit killing almost everything in the Appalachia. 
---
Honestly my main is a crit stealth build but I don't plan on playing that guy as a raider.
---
I think it would be cool to have an explosive based build as my raider RP. So it would be a new toon all together.
---
What are you babbling about?
---
Before I set up a shop, I had a nice wrap around deck with crafting benches and stash boxes easily accessible to anyone that passed by. The house itself and the collector inside were both locked. 
---
New toon?  Eh.  How long will it take you to get to 60 or so?  Also, I only communicate through emotes and horn honks.  Surely that's not a problem.
---
It’s a holdover across all Fallout subs, man. Don’t like it, create your own. /r/FO76Pics or something.
---
Mobs can open unlocked doors and I'd rather my fusion generator not be destroyed by a wondering scorch.
---
Oh of course not! Horn honks are the best kind of honks
---
Moisturize the People.

*sorrowful fistbump*
---
It's possible I guess. Got a friend who swears he saw a lvl 1 running about pretty much invincible with a name that implied it was a dev. 
---
As to why they'd play?  Testing is the obvious answer, though they clearly need to spend more time playing and figuring out the bugs, same goes for patches. Set up a test server and play to figure out what the next patch breaks before releasing it. 
---
I have many rifles, bloodied explosive. Seeing that I rely on stealth, a low health build isn't really that problematic.
---
The damage of my weapons with my build are:
---
Hunting rifle goes upto 500 damage at 30% on my build
---
Lever action goes upto 700 damage at 30% on my build
---
Handmade goes upto 400 damage at 30% on my build
---
Gauss rifle goes upto 900 damage at 30% on my build
---
So, I honestly do not think they are weak. With the right perks, mods, and mutations. They can potentially be nuke quality weapons.
---
If you have no reason to believe they are telling the truth, then you did the right thing
---
nice story!
---
By the time i reached high enough level to find and use and lmg i had 2k bullets in storage even with using hunting rifle all the time. Then i found the lmg, used most of the bullets on a scorchbeast and accompanying mobs, realised lmg sucks, sold to merch.
---
I got that once and scrapped it, as I recall. Hopefully we'll be able to decorate with junk pretty soon.
---
I'd hold on to that, if I were you. Sorry I scrapped mine now.
---
You need the "Welcome Home" neon sign from atom shop!!
---
Yes
---
Unless they patched it (haven't checked to verify) super duper only dupes the base amount, so with ammosmith and super duper, assuming a dupe, the output is 280.  The base amount, the 80% extra from ammosmith, and the duped base amount.

The title just has me imagining running into a bug that spawns a scorched variety of the New Zealand national Rugby Union team

While I agree that decoding the codes is ridiculous,  I absolutely love the Silo part.
---
I agree
---
Jack and Coke.  Way to argue with your bartendriss with 100% mental cognition.
---
I’m lvl 126 but I literally spent a days worth doing the xp glitch in watoga high school 
---
Demo expert makes only a small impact on the damage and isn't worth the 5 point investment.  
---
It was a huge boon before when the bonus for explosive was 100% (and demo expert doubled that) but now that bonus damage is only 20%, and demo expert only tacks on an extra 60% of that bonus damage to the total. 
---
So, if my math is correct, it originally (paired with the explosive effect) added 200% base damage to the total but not, including the effect, adds 32% total. 
---
Yep. I got it fairly early on, long before I had 10,000 caps at the same time. It was cumulative.
---
Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar.
---
Sell your extra legendaries, ammo, mats, plans, etc there.

If you have some good stuff, it's pretty easy to mass 5k to 15k in a day of trading.
---
On XB and I find them regularly.
---
I don’t know what it is with me but I’ve only had the servers disconnect three times, twice during the beta. And I’m just on the standard Xbox...
---
8k?
---
Wouldn't you get disease and rad everytime you go home?
---
Just tried it. Cool but wouldn't use it. Does it work for other items that give more xp?
---
I went to white spring for the first time at level 19 and finished this mission pretty quick. I was a little confused by this thread.
---
Silos are a challenge but I’d do it again. My first one was really stressful. My daughter and I were not coordinating our tactics at first and ended up creating mountains of dead robots before getting it together. Went in with 2000 rounds and ended up finishing with my crappy at the time melee 
---
Idk. The main thing is that it scraps into the required components. Anything else that does the same thing would work too. I tried making a blueprint for placing so it would go faster, but it was still only about 100 experience a minute. 
---
Yeah, melee is best, but there are plenty of downsides just keep sb fights to a minimum
---
Just out of curiosity, what is a selfpost?
---
I'm guessing the decoding part is supposed yo add on to the "end game" but in reality, its a shit show for people who just casually play, like myself. The silo is another story. Imagine going through the silo, and then D/cing after the nuke launch. 
---
Good info thank you. 
---
I think maybe by the time I got to the silo part I had gone from playing a game to having to finish it and was frustrated as such.
---
Aquaman/girl perk should take care of that
---
So other people should have to be forced to drag out the event and risk not completing it because you're too lazy to farm legendaries using the best method?  
---
Workshops are a PVP zone, why even bother with them. You can literally place you camp next to hundreds of deposits across the map undisturbed. If you just mining resources, just move your camp to a resource area of your choice and then move to another deposit undisturbed. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also blue print out workshop, don't use your own resources, so you can setup quickly on another server.  People who aren't into PVP spent too much time setting up,  If you going to setup, do it strategically, get in and get out or do it on an alt.
---
Just know some douche bag will likely take it from you. My latest strategy is to build a nice complex but empty house, then blue print it, then fill up any remaining budget of my workshop I don't need. So if someone takes it a) they got to pay more caps and b) they got to breakdown anything I build if they want to build .. don't make it useful to the next person outside of what you need it for.
---
Why are you complaining like seriously its ass
---
&gt;Imagine going through the silo, and then D/cing after the nuke launch.

*Shudders.*

Congrats! Adding scorched killer or sacrificial blade mods adds a star.

Now go back to play your unfinished game, sheep.
---
I turn my Xbox on and launch 76, duh
---
It would be just tedious if it weren't for how dangerous the Colonel Gusty's are... 
---
Sounds like you should have taken a break and done the Silo later for fun. Doing something just because you feel forced to finish is never fun 
---
If your done with a game you usually don’t go on their thread after the fact and make a post. Keep it movin 
---
Isn't there a separate forum for the marketplace?
---
Some people like to play with ass and thats ok.
---
I love it tbh, I’d use it

If you found an exploit, please report it to Bethesda.

How do you have the time and energy to post about a game you don’t play because it bothers you that people are playing and enjoying a game that you don’t play?

We'll see you in the discord then.

FYI, he's quite an entertaining raider. I'm quite fond of the rad emitter in the locked shitter trap.  
---
Side note:  did you know you can lock the door to the porta-shitter?  I didn't until I saw him do it. 
---
Love my vampiric deathclaw gauntlet
---
Which was my plan but I read apparently the codes reset at the end of the week; not knowing when exactly (GMT, AEST, EST?) I thought I better push through.
---
Will only take an hour and a bit, right?
---
Probably. I'm new to Reddit so I'm still figuring shit as I go. Thanks for letting me know. Intrested or nah?
---
Ah there's a discord? I wasn't aware of that!

Locked porta-shitters are the best I've heard

My good ol handmade - anti armor, explosive, improved reload speed.

Found this and then changed my build from shotgun/Rifleman to rifleman/melee.

WS and SBQ
---
Stabbing and shooting.  Occasionally building and scrapping.
---
Just a small raider one we're both in. He goes by a different name there, but he's quite amusing. Theres a video he posted up on here somewhere that had him trapping a pair.  One is locked in the trap, the other is stupid enough to pick the lock and pop wanted while inside a locked room. 
---
I didn't expel too much energy friend. Thanks for asking
---
Okay buddy. Have fun bantering in your sad little corner of the internet on a sub of q game you just hate so much.

I was bored until I bought my new rifle, now I'm back to no sleep :). I knew 5herr was a reason I gave MMOs a decade ago :P
---
Go melee, lots of knives, sledgehammers &amp; baseball bats all modded to cause max damage, good armour set and plenty of stims. With a gun that delivers a good close quarters hit, and maybe a 10mm auto to deal with missed turrets. A boatload of junk to short circuit the finding mainframe searching bit by building them at a tinker's bench. Good hacking skills, lockpicking too. Add a friend or two to deal with the robots and it won't be such a drag. I enjoy soloing them, with the exception where I get overwhelmed and have to run through 75% of the complex again  but even that gets me more junk with fresh robots in some spots. The whole decoding bit is annoying, but in the spirit of the game, being one of cooperating with others to achieve a common goal, getting the codes from elsewhere, isn't a cheat or glitch, you've still got to get to the control room.

Id do that psn rogue-firebomb.   You on now?

I have tried AA/Zealot/Exterminator/Vampire Gatling/50/Minigun.  The only one I like is Gatling Vampire. Don’t get a lot of bang, but limit chem and ammo drain.   I really liked my Zealots Minigun, but the ammo drain was unbelievable. My 50 Two Shot Prime was nice, but again the resource drain was substantial. The cost to benefit on the queen was ridiculous. I quit trying 
---
You don't like it, don't play. Simple as that
---
Thank you! I was looking for the location for almost an hour!

Because it’s better than Anthem and The Division 2.
---
I've got the keypad switches attached to the doors. Now while these don't work exactly the way they probably should since flicking the switch bypasses it completely, I have mounted the passcodes using the lettering set on the wall  near each pad so people can get in and out but still keep the doors closed.
---
Yeah. 
---
Any particular places you like to stab/shoot?
---
Is this a bug? I'm pretty sure the pop-up only happens once.  I believe it's at worst once per character.  Around a month and a half ago when they informed you about changing icons, that was the last time I ever got this 'pop-up'.  It should only be once, so if you're getting it multiple times, something is wrong, or something isn't right.
---
This is funny. I don’t care who you are, that’s some funny stuff right there

I’ll come to you, indiscriminate deathclaw at my camp

Or we could scavenge for boxes of syrup and fix one of the machines for a nukacola fountain machine in camp. We'd have it in the disposable cups. No caps from drinking but benefits from cola nut. Nukacola from the machines would go flat and be less beneficial than the bottled kind. I mean... If I can make a fusion generator, why wouldn't I scavenge a nukacola fountain from a park?
---
I’ll be on in an hr and a half, you still got it

I see posts with glitch rock every now and then and people always say that it's simply that, a glitch. But in my experience modding/3d modeling for FO4, corrupt textures or textures that fail to load don't display like that. I've seen cases of failed-to-load texture in 76 too (my friend's power armor, every time I dig treasure mounds, etc.) and they all appear as they did in FO4 -- as a solid purple color. Code just does not get printed onto in-game objects like that because textures are image files. If an error was thrown, the message would go to the debug console, not show up on the mesh. And the syntax of the code looks made up to me. Although maybe a more experienced programmer can point out if I'm wrong (:
---
I think glitch rock is intentional. I don't know to what end since as much as I like the simulation theory I just don't see Bethesda doing it. But it's fun to think about!
---
Be on in an hr and a half, you still got it
---
Same here but with PS4. Sometimes though my kid has left one of his games in so I gotta get up, walk over to the PS4, eject the game, put it away, open my Fallout 76 steel book game case, remove the game, put it into the PS4, and then load in. I hope reading this comment has wasted 30 second of your day, as your post has done to me.
---
There are risks to logging out of the game in random locations - when you log back in, you might be neck deep in trouble.
---
If your safety plan was limited to switching servers, you may want to revisit things.
---
I haven’t seen any notifications to change my player icon, but I can certainly understand your frustration directly tied to that.
---
My first solo run was total hell. All my guns were either broke or out of ammo by the time I got to the end. Next few were a bit better as I knew what I was doing, but still tedious. Now?  I've got the layout memorized and it's a hair over 15 minutes between getting off the elevator and fast traveling out, assuming no bugs. 
---
A few tips:    
---
- You can lockpick and hack (lvl 3 of each) past the reactor room.  No need to do the repair.    
---
- You can carry in the 15 cores. Just carry out the damaged ones, repair them at your leisure, then carry them back in on the next run.    
---
- Explosives make short work of destroying the mainframes.    
---
- Once in the storage room, there's a terminal locked door that leads back to the entrance. Open it in case you die in there or the control room.  It will save you a lot of running through areas you've already cleared (and where bots spawned again). 
---
Duh the one in the clown costume..

Delete the character and make a new one? I can't imagine an easier fix

Must be difficult being such a fanboy of a broken game... I mean how often do you keep sore of all the butthurt ? Like all day ? 
---
So glad I've just read this. Stuck on 9 of 10.
---
Same. 9 0f 10 in 1 hour none since.
---
Because I like to have a private space to chill.  However I do leave a stashbox and weapon workbench outside so people can scrap and stash.
---

---
Thank you
---
I find them around the top of the world cabins
---
I dropped a nuke in my pants 
---
Once you get the hang of it it’s super easy. Takes around half an hour, you just need to practice. 
---
Thanks for testing my trap that was great. 
---
The head is usually most effective.
---
Well I would rather be a fan of a "brojen game", than to be a sad boy. Pretty easy choice.
---
Can you post your friend's system specs? It sure sounds like its a hardware issue to me.
---
If your Game is freezing when you leave the Vault, you probably don't mean the minspec for the Game. Post your System specs
---
The release and "beta" was just horrible. I played for about 2 weeks and got tired of it. With the new roadmap and hitnts of what's comming up I'm really hopeful for fallout 76. I can't say it's my favorite yet but as a long time fallout fan since the original.... it's getting my attention back and feeling a lot more like a fallout. 
---
He is reinstalling it since he deleted it and we will try that and let you know how it goes. Thanks.
---
It feels like they forgot a zero at the end and it was supposed to give 50 fuel, that's the only way it would be worth it.
---
It's on PS4 sorry I didn't specify not pro just standard.
---
Because I enjoy it? Like I dunno, I still play TF2 and the first Halo, and they’re pretty old. 
---
Come to my multi leveled platform base, no walls, just ladders and floors, have a seat up top watching scorchbeasts toasting a random level 15 running towards Watoga and then seeing the robots get involved, before getting back into your Power Armor and jumping into the swimming hole on your wawa ay to help them. Help yourselves to the purifier and benches, stash, piano and beds. All welcome. Xbox 
---
It's on PS4 sorry I didn't specify 
---
U still on? I’m interested
---
Are you seriously that desperate to white knight for Bethesda? They stuck a fucking pop up ad in the games map and menu. 
---
This isn't an issue with where I logged out. If I had logged in and gotten myself killed by my own inaction that would be on my head. 
---
But that isn't what killed me. What killed me was the half assed second loading screen Bethesda cobbled together to make up for how shitily this game loads which left me getting detected and attacked before I could even move combined with the umpteenth time Bethesda shoved a cash shop ad in my face when I needed to get to essential game functions. 
---
Wait nvm I don’t have enough caps
---
Nuts, I got baited and it wasn't even for me I think I wasted 2 minutes here
---
Maybe don't hoard 1,000  lol
---
No no not delete the game, delete the character. When at the main menu choose character, there is an option to delete character have to type in the character's name. Do that. It seems like that character got corrupted during a disconnect at the perfect time.
---
Is it really better than division 2?
---
Ik but he already deleted the game when I posted this.
---
I rather be neither lol, after all it feels pretty good here playing RE2 + Kingdom Hearts 3 + Red Dead Redemption 2.
---
Be careful with those tears on your nylon bag, shit is so low quality you may bust it, lmao
---
It has its fair share of bugs. At first they will annoy you. But they grow on you as you play. 
---
The tricentennial edition is ok. The skins paint are red blue and gold for most of the weapons and the outfits are nice look. 
---
I believe the downloads for the other games ended in January. 
---
Vats is not bad. The non slowing of time take a moment to get the hang of but it’s no different. 
---
Okay. Once he's deleted that particular character it should be fine
---
I said the same thing and got the same responses, “It’s just a way to track your hours.” I say that’s bull crap, and the challenges should be significantly fewer hours 
---
What are you interested in and how many caps will you pay it?
---
EXACTLY!!! I cant wait!!
---
Thanks 
---
I only have 500 caps
---
I didn't get banned, that's how I'm still playing.
---
My trusty all star baseball bat and enough throwing knives to supply every episode of hell’s kitchen for the next year.
---
Related questions: does any special stat increase the damage of throwing knives? And is there a solid gun/rifle that works decently without any investment in the related perks?
---
Oh. Um I could sell you like 3 marsupial serums for 500 caps.
---
I'm on PC.
---
1. It gets better and better.
---
2. IMO, useless; does not add to the game (AFAIK).
---
3. I'm not certain (don't care)
---
4. VATS works really well in real-time; you need to be a bit more trigger happy, but when you get into a groove, it is seamless (**NOTE**: it takes a fraction of a second between entering VATS and seeing the hit percentages)
---
5. Interaction also works well (\*); you can choose to ignore everyone, to full team up with friends or strangers; i play solo, i don't interact that much, mostly because i never played MMO before, and don't have a mic and because the emotes lack in real interactions (IMO)
---
(\*) You will encounter griefers that will make your life miserable; just block them and/or switch servers.
---
I need a lie down just thinking about it.
---
Na, just use the trade function and have them set the prices like normal and go ahead and buy shit. 
---
you can solo the nuke silos its just a little bit more tedious as their are a crap ton of enemies
---
1) Not that buggy, at least not any worse then Fallout 4 at this point. Server disconnects are still thing though, however that's gotten way better lately.
---
2) That's up to you. I'm not American either but I like style personally.
---
3) VATS is an auto target system now, live action. It works basically the same only you need to be quicker. Player interaction is whatever you want it to be. There are very few griefers if that's your concern. Most people are nice and will help lower levels out.
---
With just buying/selling items for caps?  Should be pretty safe.  Trades are generally what the scammers use.
---
I've heard of a glitch that allows someone to steal stuff if they initiate the trade with their weapon drawn, but I've never seen anything concrete about it. 
---
:))
---
I don't know. My recent experience of playing FO76 with a newbie includes a big chunk of explaining various bugs and annoyances that Bethesda will probably never fix. At least they don't have to deal with the 400 stash limit though. The servers are still shaky, but they've been worse.
---
Getting blocked out of the Savage Divide by max level enemies is a new problem. When I played the game first time around, you just did the quests as they came up.
---
That's just radiculous....ly tastey....
---
Thanks, it's stuff like that that made me wonder.
---
I loved previous titles of fallout, for all sorts of reasons, they had bugs for days, but nothing that stoped me from playing, cause i couldnt put em down. I preordered 76, played for a few hours and didnt experience bugs unless i tried to make a camp or fought enemies, which were kinda bad, but i coulda looked past it, if it werent for the fact that I just found the experience so so boring, not the slightest bit of excitement or joy. So i just left it alone to wait, and see if changes were made that could make the experience better. But honestly if they already updated it with two high gig updates and its still a mess, can it get any better? Ill wait and see, but ive already accepted it as a lost cause. 
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
900 hour guy said he was temporarily disabled and getting money from, I’m assuming, insurance/gvmt.
---
As far as playing that much, sure it’s a lot, but if it’s all you do besides nessecaties I could see it. Some people see different things as fun too.
---
 For me there is something very relaxing and enjoyable to looting random items. And combat is still interesting to me. My highest character is 70 though. I just started two new characters to play around with other game mechanics.
---
Also I’m having fun getting better at some of the more complicated events, like Powering Up and the Bolton Greens event.
---
How's that going to fix thier terrible game engine? This game really is terrible, every diehard fallout fan I know quit the game after a few weeks saying it's so broken they cant stand it. When you have rampant ui errors, connectivity issues, constant frame rate issues. Not to mention the ability to get out of the map, use insane amounts of exploits unheard of on in typical consoles games. Its comparable to how broken elder scrolls online was with camohunter caltrops. I dont hold Bethesda in any high regard after they threw this garbage at us. I won't be buying elderscrolls when it comes out. Bethesda can eat my meat whistle.
---
Amazing thread make another one 
---
I use a mouse and keyboard, that's how.
---
I would avoid bazaar. There have been some iffy deals including the moderators allowing for people to fake up bid an item so that the seller gets more money from the person who would actually buy the item.
---
I will
---
Wild! Thanks for the info. 
---
Or just take Hemlock Holes Maintenance. 
---
It happened to me yesterday; i did not know about PVP at workshops (after a few hundred hours of play)
---
I was hauling all my junk (yeah stupid of me) to clean up my stash on me and lost everything (really!!)  
---
I learned my lesson; all junk cleaning like that will be done at home.
---
PC. I feel that most people who have slow loads, crashes, and disconnect issues are on console.
---
I think that was actually patched
---
I drop a propaganda poster in every house I vist.  Just one.  Nothing else.
---
Some spawn in the flooded train yard, but it's a random spawn and plenty of other things could spawn instead. 
---
If you're doing it for acid, you can also hit Yao Gaui. They carry acid too. The proboscis of the bloodbug also has some. 
---
I was gripped from the beginning, something similar happened to me, but I was the level 45 and I had no knight in shining armour. 
---
There are plenty of good players out there like you, then there are turds like the farmer. Thanks for posting 😁
---
What platform we're you playing on?
---
Don't you also get some from making one?  
---
xbox probably has more people. Toxic? Hard to say unless you played both. With any society you have good and bad people. I've never been scammed on pc and i've done over 700 trades. 
---
I've got a couple over the last few days, I find the easiest way to get them is take over a workshop and wait for it to get attacked by robots then loot them. I've been setting up at Charleston Landfill and robots are the most common thing I have to defend against there
---
I’m pretty sure the cap limit is due to server performance issues.
---
Where was this invisible wall at?  
---
Thanks for posting that sub,  I'm definitely going there lol!
---
You don't lend a lot of credibility to your troll post when this is the first time you have even commented on any FO76 sub.
---
Rated M for Meh.
---
Boring night huh bud? 
---
The player icon notification and its delay was a direct cause of your death, but the root cause was your choice to log out from a potentially unsafe area.
---
If you had logged out from a train station, for example, your likelihood of being killed by the delay caused by the notification would be very minimal.
---
As an aside, as another player mentioned, you shouldn’t be getting that notification repeatedly.
---
Recon sensors help too. Maintains the tag even when using a melee weapon. 
---
Same here! I can't wait to offer my service as a bodyguard. I love the pvp and challenging fights are hard to come by lately.
---
When setting up a workshop, only set up collectors for what you need. That way,  should some "delightful person" take your workshop, there is minimal loss. Also, most collectors only require 10 power, so don't use a fusion generator. 
---
I ran one last night on an empty server, took 15 min, nuked white springs.  Got over 50+ legendaries, leveled up 3 times, one of which i just sold for 8k. My buddy got a bloodied explosive during the foray.  Most fun ive had in this game. We were the only two people on the server. 
---
I still like this game, just frustrated with the lack of PvE options and goig to wait for an update before coming back.
---
Yes. 25k per character. 
---
Many players have multiple characters. Some use those extra characters as mules for their junk and caps. 
---
I love the flamer and would love to use it :'(
---
Got 1 calibrated shocks on about my 5th try.... looking for the jetpack  for for five days
---
Already being done using other players or their own extra characters as the bank. 
---
What's your point
---
&gt;1.How buggy is the game  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;2.Is the Deluxe edition worth it for a non American (as it has a lot of American paints and outfits)  
---
&gt;3 can I get Fallout 1,2 and Tactics or is that expired  
---
&gt;And 4.How does this game actually work in things like VATS and interactions with other players
---
1. Still quite buggy but generally not a way that affects day to day gameplay. Worst "bugs" atm are more late-game issues such as really long load times on corpses during and after end-game boss fight and the end game boss itself is nigh on unkillable compared to what it use to be.
---
2. Only if you care about cosmetics. Personally I'm not into it so a waste of money for me. If you can get it real cheap, maybe.
---
3. That offer was for people that purchased the game prior to the offer so unlikely but who knows.
---
4. It's a very vague question so you'll have to clarify. What do you mean specifically by the question? What interactions? Outside of certain events, VATS targets friendlies, neutrals and enemies alike. In those events, only enemies can be targeted with VATS.
---
Powered doors on pressure plates.
---
I would like to see them go the other way and introduce no PvP servers, but I see the plot holes in that too. You couldn't really have the workshops as they count as PvP. But would like to see it in the future.
---
Mothman is from Point Pleasant, not Flatwoods. 
---
[XB1] I regularly drop off excess in the ice machine at white springs the bag out of white springs station and the blue suitcase at watoga station. I haven’t found anything yet at any of the locations yet. Maybe one day I’ll get lucky. 
---
Never seen this before on Xbox.
---
Yep most vendors sell them
---
Name checks out.
---
"you’re concerned about which part of the chain I replied to" Yes. That matters, man. 
---
That's how conversations work. 
---
There are many ways that Bethesda could notify people of where to change your icon and direct people to the Atom Store. An obtrusive pop-up that forces you to remove it is a very annoying way to handle it.
---
Having said that though, scum quitting the game like that just to save yourself is pretty shitty. If you'd played smarter, you would never have been caught in that position but if it doesn't affect anyone else, who cares, right? Maybe stick to areas that you can handle and quit the game in safer areas?
---
I played since launch. I have never been able to complete the quest 😂
---
Can other players take my displayed armor?
---
Played a few hundred hours, the intial fo76 with the constant whitesprings nuke spam and server crashes and dupers galore.
---
Took a two month break came back
---
Fo76 Is a different beast now since my most recent run through on a new character. It seems like the servers are more stable the game is less buggy. But leveling has become more linear mainly pushing you to do the quests chains as they come versus jumping to do the Enclave.
---
But mobs now drop inconsistent loot and I feel less incentivized when killing a 3 star legendary creature to only get a one star potentially trash drop. Which happens constantly now, I've also seen mobs legendary status change levels which is werid like a three star becoming a two or one star.
---
So it's give and take I guess.
---
I've played 3,4 and 76 if that is anything 
---
ok thanks
---
Halo 1 is timeless.
---
Still not worth the risk of "dropping" it. 
---
Just a handmade with the furious legendary. Very powerful and versatile. Haven’t come across a better gun yet.
---
That doesn't stop disease though.
---
They could be like me. I have my ps4 set to where only friends can send me messages. I'm sure people have tried to holler
---
I just do it in person and in game 
---
I just got off for the night, but I'll send you a friend request tomorrow for future launches. Never launched before, so would want to be part of a team
---
Badass! 
---
So criticals build up for every hit you get and usually stronger weapons build it up quicker 
---
Guess it goes to show how bad I am at keeping caps, I've been playing since the beta and not even got *close* to the limit. Don't think I've even gone over 2k yet.
---
-  .50 cal silenced piercing recon sniper rifle (primary)
---
-  .45 cal silenced piercing combat sniper rifle (secondary)
---
-  Silenced instigating night vision automatic combat shotgun (CQC)
---
-   instigating black powder rifle (for one shotting really strong enemies)
---
Run that with the following build https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f71fd3&amp;d=s01ao0an2ag2ar2l62cr0i30ia0i50ii0ij2ic4e00p02pd0pk0pl0pa0p80p90pf0pr2pe0il2ei2e20at1ah0&amp;w=&amp;n=Quigley%20Would%20Be%20Proud (I swap out robotics expert for 3 star weapon artisan when i repair my guns that coupled with 5 star gunsmith and how patiently I'll wait for a good headshot means my weapons last an insanely long time)
---
Then at least 1 chameleon armor piece for optic camouflage plus whatever i can piecemeal together throw my sparkly red dress on and my tinfoil hat and I'm ready to paint the town red  WITH THE BLOOD OF MY ENEMIES!!!!
---
Against what?
---
I mean, that does follow the "remove everything fun and turn it into shit" methodology. 
---
Plasma and Gauss should. They have actual projectiles. Lasers shouldn't though. 
---
I saw a female body in there but she was unnamed and I couldn't find any holos or anything. The wiki actually says there is one called kellys holotape so that is prob what your referring to.
---
Well of course everyone wants weapons grade sofas they explode whenever someone sits down on it
---
...why?
---
I guess it depends on the person. I find grinding after work relaxing and I grind less for the gear than the stress relieve it brings. I only do quests and story missions on the weekend since the time commitment I find is bigger to complete story missions.
---
The only reason I am not on 800h is because I divide my grind between Warframe, FO76, TD1 &amp; Apex Legends. I want to start Destiny 2 soon, really got the itch for that one and Activision gave it to me for free a while back.
---
I guess it also depends on why you are grinding. If it is for loot only then yeah FO76 will get boring after a few farming runs.
---
I think FO76 will eventually go the way Warframe and TD1 did. Level is just one score out of a few. Warframe have levels on gear and the Mastery Rank (MR). TD1 have levels and then Gear Score and they even threw in Dark Zone Levelling and Underground Levelling for good measure.
---
Also I don't watch TV at all and only sleep 6.5h a night, so that frees up a lot of time.
---
So we're suffering for having a bonus? That's not really rewarding... 
---
against the rocket launcher. Reworded, Stabilized works with the rocket launcher.
---
I am not paying for your therapist’s time.
---
Cause gamebryo 
---
Depends on what you are building. I’ve recently decided to build a fusion reactor at my camp, and a decontamination shower. So roughy 150+ aluminum. Plus many weapons need it to repair. When you are running the plasma Gatling, which breaks after 1 decent boss fight. You need a lot of it. 
---
I started out dreading it. Ever since I left the vault I was always worried that some stupid player would come on my server and ruin my fun. However after time went on the legendary turd JeemFeezy never appeared and I realized that he never would because some things are just too classy for some people. He's there I've heard, lurking in the shadows, hiding under bridges and still king of the winkies. 
---
I feel you! My AAE combat shotgun really is a bother to use... 
---
The world may never know
---
Bloodied vats crit and bloodied expl are the meta. Unyielding gear yielding 3k damage. 
---
Been there forever. I've made countless trips up the river farming stuff for disease cures. Always stop at Slocum's for the firecaps that surround it. 
---
I didn’t even think of that, it can stagger like every time?
---
Completely agree. We should need to repair our guns several times every hour.... 
---
Oh my bad, thank you
---
I..don't need a therapist. I need people on the internet to learn how to read. 
---
Xbox
---
you sure it wasnt the radiation symbol?
---
Your build relies on being on a team, other builds rely on having lone wanderer. Can't have both. So yeah they would help you but you would nerf them in some cases.
---
Maybe it could happen to my TS-FFR lvl45 one... That thing destroys everything and is so awesome to use! 
---
I guess I should have asked how does the game perform on Xbox one X to see if it’s worth me upgrading. 
---
Using PA myself. It hardly ever breaks = fun! 
---
100% positive since I've played several hundred hours and have killied every mob in the game in all there formats, dieseaed, glowing, scorched, albino etc
---
Wholesome post
---
Lots of bullets, accurately on target? Nothing to hate about it, that's for sure. 
---
All that is fixed and I mean rolling content, as for the 22 he probably just had a really good build
---
I toss out tons of steel and gunpowder and sometimes plans. Also for ammo if I see someone else trading I'll either get on local voice or shoot then a message and ask what ammo they use. I stockpile all I get and hand it out to other people using different builds. If I ever run into a level 1-30ish I offer to make them a set of studded leather pocketed armor limbs and a leaded studded leather chestplate. I cap put at level 20 since it doesn't require balistics fiber to make or repair. I like to think they use the armor for awhile.  
---
I'm more of a Vim guy myself.
---
If memory serves, there's some lore tapes in white springs that explains how and why the bots use caps. Something about rationing supplies.
---
There are easier ways to get more atoms. I don’t understand the outrage. 
---
My Fireproof and Emergency Protocols laugh at your TSE barely scratching the paint on my PA. 
---
Seriously. I've been up against them and they're not a threat to a guy who never goes above 20% health.  Melee seems to bypass the blocker/protocols combo somehow though. 
---
Id like to see the back of the vault dweller there, I want to know where she came from 
---
If you have potential friends to play with, pick the system with them. If not, assuming you have a solid rig I would say PC for the sake of performance. 
---
I do it often and have not experienced any issues
---
I bet there is a vault around there somewhere
---
My comment is still valid for the overall thread.  My apologies to His Majesty for the incorrect placement of that particular reply.
---
i quit this game at 58 level.
---
I usually put a stash box next to each collector so it’s a quick pick up and drop off and on to the next one. 
---
Can't you just change the icon once then change it back to whatever you are using? If don't have any unlocked the icons are pretty damn low cost... just pick a cheap one and be done with it. 
---
The whole game is bugged beyond unplayable.
---
Only time I've ever had this happen I was wanted. 
---
I remember fallout 4 having ice-cold nuka cola as a variant
---
I changed my icon weeks ago and I've clicked the button to go to the shop several times hoping it would trip a flag or something and it just keeps coming back over and over and over. 
---
Xbox, but then I'm biased. There is always a feeling of needing to upgrade components on PC, while a console is generally a more level play field. And before anyone says, yes there's the Xbox One X, better graphics etc. Comes down to your playstyle more than anything. WASD or controller?
---
This happened to me on my first nuke launch. I was about lvl 60 and just ran through it all by myself. Get to the nuke zone to watch it land and get disconnected right before it hits. I had no friends on 76 at that time so no way to get back to that server. Was such a disappointment. 
---
Got my hours by: playing with friends. Friend A needs help doing something. Do that. Friend A gets off, but friend B just got online and you can help them out now with what they have going on
---
I hate getting killed at my workshop too, but that’s what also makes it interesting/exciting. We always know what the monsters are going to do and that gets boring. Human players are a challenge and make situations so much less predictable.
---
You can get the plans in Fort Defiance on Taggerdy's terminal for free. 
---
EXACTLY
---
Just get in the habit of dropping it. I know it goes against all your instincts, but it's the only way after you cleaned out all the vendors. 
---
Id have to do the questline and all that and don't have the time at the moment so that's why I'm trading :)
---
PACIFIST  
---
NOUN 
---
1. a person who believes that war and violence are unjustifiable.
---
ADJECTIVE 
---
1. holding the belief that war and violence are unjustifiable.
---
So... it doesn't really mean you can't be killed, means you don't plan to hurt someone else and kill them. It protects you from doing damage to others, not taking damage.
---
If my C.A.M.P was pacifist, then it would not fire against any enemy attacks.
---
Lol you make 1400/day just selling to vendors, never mind cap stashes, event rewards etc
---
How are you still wasting your time trolling about a game you don't like? At what point do you move on and focus your time and energy on something positive, like a game you *do* enjoy?  Nothing wrong with disliking the game or its devs,  but this post is [sad and pathetic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2fQpwdc_EQ). Go back to /r/fallout.
---
I apologize for my delay response, I want thank everyone for your opinions and advice, I  was just curious, I  thought I was doing something wrong lol. Nonetheless I appreciate your help and time in this matter, I  look forward to seeing you in the wasteland. I wish everyone the best! 
---
I did get it twice already, to be fair... 
---
I get that, I just hate how unbalanced things are. If you dont have an instakill weapon there's no point in trying to get revenge.
---
How about they fix their broken ass game instead of adding stupid shit from previous titles?
---
The person who said that was wrong though so why cling to it?
---
It was easy
---
Yes, I farm Huntersville because my camp is close by. There's a decent chance of legendary spawns there, plus the caps, gunpowder, screws and steel that comes with super mutants.
---
You sir are amazing. thank you
---
Because BGS can't make a working game.
---
Careful friend. Your autism is showing. 
---
Same here.  I even put music instruments out for everyone to play on the porch.  Too bad I can't leave a pitcher of lemonade out as well.
---
Will somebody please tell me wtf a TSE is? I’ve been roaming this sub for 3 weeks and still have no clue. Please, let me inside - the wasteland is cruel to the lonely.
---
must be the disease symbol then, anytime i look at a 3star that looks like theres 4 its always one of the type symbols when i take a longer look. next time take your time to look.
---
Devs play on testing servers.  You will rarely ever see them in game.
---
They would be better off making the LMG into a different caliber. If they changed it to 8mm like the MG42 and then increased the crafting amount in comparsion to the .308 it would see a lot more use.
---
Not my work. Just passing on the info...

No offense sir but it is a 3 star. The sacrificial blade automatically adds a star, but still a very decent find.
---
Each camp I leave the Weapons Bench, a Stash Box, and Cooking Station outside. I also leave one of the Water Purifiers unlocked. I lock all the rest to try an keep from having things destroyed and the expense to repair them. Hard enough to keep up with my Armor and Weapon repairs as is.
---
That's pretty good for fighting Yao Guais I bet.
---
If the game is so terrible then why are you reading posts about it. Get over it and play something else. Some of us are still enjoying this game.
---
Agreed. Steel, led, wood, cloth. They all are SUPER common.
---
I can help yall with the discord if you need me to. We can talk tomorrow after I get off work at 5pm EST
---
But not to what you actually replied to. Why do you not get this?
---
No but that is hilarious :D
---
over a month now . for me atleast 
---
You get one for free at the end of the questline. Not to discourage you from trading because I've had nothing but a positive experience with it... But 500 caps is a little low to craft a full set Ultracite PA. Springs and screws are hard to find, and Ultracite is a pain in the butt to farm.
---
Find someone that uses heavy weapons to trade or sell with. I have to farm a lot of steel, lead and acid to make ammo at least every other day.
---
You still want the item bro 😀
---
Yeah...this is not only a crazy low ball offer, you can get what you're looking for by playing the game. 
---
I'd rather them fix the fucking game instead of add more stuff that will undoubtedly be just as broken.
---
I kinda always assumed she was from the same vault as the rest of us mugs, but...
---
Well I mean watching a video on rare outfits is the same as hunting them down on the internet. Just makes it faster and easier instead of going on these wiki pages that have no pictures and no info on them. 
---
I know what the diseased symbol looks like and it was not it. I assumed the same thing you did till I encountered it three more times. 
---
The intial two times ive seen it I dismissed it the same way you did but I've encountered it on a level 68 super mutants and level 50 mirelurk queen and a level 35 direwolf.
---
I've killied hundreds of mobs since in between sighing all of them including diseased versions of the excat creature types I just mentioned and the symbols where completely different.
---
Bye
---
...well that's a neat bug that they'll nerf later. 
---
is there actually proof of that ever happening? 
---
I can go up to 1000 caps plus some screws about 70 
---
Power armor, but I think they toned down the numbers
---
If C.A.M.P was pacifist, it would sustain minimal/reduced damage just like the character (against players). I'm only talking Versus other players, not the common enemies. That reduced damage, would also maybe give you the time needed to change over your settings to defend. 
---
Do explosives not move her around? I’ve used grenades to get bugged magazines accessible before
---
I can go up to 1000 caps plus I'll dip in a bunch if crafting matterials just don't feel like doing the quest 
---
What platform? If a console, I would do a deep dive into your router settings. FO76 does not like outdated drivers and prefers to be on a reserved static LAN IP rather than shifted around as other items connect to the wifi.
---
Not gonna lie, the biggest risk I see in that transaction is YOU.  I've done some trading, but I'd never do a trade with a reddit account that's made on the same day. 
---
Somebody please downvote this post to it can get 76 upvotes
---
Should start giving a revolver with a single bullet. 
---
Unfortunately, there's a decided marketing push to bring in toxic players. Every platform has that issue. 
---
As for platforms...I, personally, won't buy a bethesda game on anything but PC due to the inevitable better mod support. 
---
They require a lot of bullets to take down. Something like the gatling gun that does a lot of damage and has a large magazine is the most effective against them. I think the lowest level scorchbeast is lvl 50.
---
Nylacrypt.com releases solved codes each week and I have used them multiple times, so can confirm it works.
---
I think it’s chance based.  But not every hit. I think mobs get DR from too many. 
---
Yeah 50. The one at Morgantown airport can show up at 45
---
It's against the Geneva Convention to use the sofas, but the UN is not around anymore. 
---
I assume you mean Blunders not plunders. 
---
Also, played all of Bethesda's games with the exception of Morrowind. 
---
Yeah there are some tapes and terminal entries. 
---
Good to know.
---
They've toned down the SB's sonic attack, so it doesn't spam you so hard, if that's what getting you antsy over a fight. A good auto weapon with good supplies of ammo is always a good idea. Prior to level 40 I would've hightailed it away from one, now it's more a case if whether or not someone else will kill it before I get a chance to get a hit in.
---
Yes, I’m sorry that was an error. Would you mind me picking at your brain then?
---
Vampire’s 50cal and Instigating 
---
+25% fire rate Gatling gun. Both found items. That’s my Heavy Weapons guy. Honestly though, he’s also got an instigating AutoGrenade and just got a Bloodied Missile Launcher I modded with 4 barrels and autotargetting. Breaks fast, ammo’s expensive, but it’s so satisfying to use. And surprisingly decent in long range PVP encounters depending on the environment. That auto tracking is nice. 
---
I use a lot of weapons on him. But the 50 and Gat are definitely my go-to!
---
My sniper uses an AA lever Action most of the time, but also has a lot of other weapons for different themes (Nuka-Girl outfit? Tricentennial-Painted Bloodied Laser Rifle/Bloodied Plasma Sniper. Enclave Officer outfit? Recon Sniper, 10mm SMG, silenced 10mm pistol.)
---
Play the fucking game? Seriously, that's the best way to get XP, go in, run around, explore, kill things. Do events. 
---
That would definitely help! 
---
I made a sign with the small letters, asking to close the door, but noone ever does.
---
One trip into Belching Betty mine with excavator on netted me 116 Black Titanium Ore.
---
I would love to get that angle!
---
I've been getting booted quite often as well. Not sure what's going on.
---
I’ve encountered a Yao guai like that.  Was a legendary glowing variant on the southern whitespring lawn. Has the bio hazard symbol and 4 stars but only dropped a medics double flamer. 
---
Ok well you can ask me here or PM in a chat up to you
---
There’s at least 3 others. I suspect she’s from the one by the red rocket truck stop.  It opened first,  not long after the bombs dropped and closed soon after. I bet dollars to donuts they had a geck and that is the source of the strangler vines 
---
Flux soups using the irradiated meat would be cool as well. As far as I know there are no recipes that use irradiated meat.
---
I tried that, no dice 
---
They need to listen to the 90% of their player base (by console statistics) that don't engage in PVP at all, and give us more fucking options to avoid it. 
---
Scrap this completely fucking moronic PVP server idea, and give us a fucking PVE server, and the PVP people can run around on the existent shit with pacifist off. 
---
That’s the goldfish your flushed in the third grade coming hug you. 
---
Alright! I’ll PM you. 
---
You’re doing your best to enlighten me of the terrible error I made.
---
If not for your valiant efforts, children in Africa may die!
---
I think it's easy enough, if you ignore the mechanics and wait for people to put out the codes. 
---
Paddle Ball 
---
Hide in a building and the SB will eventually fly away. Once you're level 50 or so you can fight it. Best thing is to get the Fireproof perk to level 3. I wait for SBs to land and then melee them since otherwise you'll use a ton of ammo.
---
+Karma 
---
Cool. I’m rolling excavator for the foreseeable future as a hoarder, but I’ll keep that 50 reserve in case. 
---
You monster
---
A broken product that you wasted your money on, as well as a perfectly functioning Microtransaction shop.
---
At 150 it's a cake walk... 
---
Each silo requires 8 codes, and then you have to de-crypt them. Much easier to let others figure out the code -- check nukacrypt.com
---
I killed all 10 in one go about a week or two ago... because I sat and worked it out in a trial by fire.
---
I ran back and forth between the golf club and the far entrance... for fun I kill the Grafton Monster thing about 5 times, along with blowing up every car I could find, several times.  I think people thought I was off my rocker.
---
The explosions drew out the ghouls from the buildings (aha!)... so I didn't have to go looking for them.  I found the 'sword' building and those near it coughed up the highest number.  I found some in the laundry building, but most came from the sword area.
---
Amazingly no robots were hurt in my rampant vehicle destruction spree.  But boy were there body parts strewn everywhere...
---
TSE = Two Shot Explosive 
---
Wait that's what causes attacks. Resource production?
---
I hear ya, I love my Instigating Grognak Axe with 40% Swing speed 
---
Maybe that was the traveling super mutant vendor Graham...
---
I’m pretty sure. It wasn’t until I planted two melons on each side of my front lawn for decoration that I started getting raided by super mutants/scorched.
---
Yeah. Somewhere on here is a post on it with screen shots of the messages.
---
My camp is off the beaten path - definitely not meant for randos to use. I would just assume not be in bed and have some weirdo creep in a stare at me while I sleep.
---
That's how I feel about my Quad Exploding 90% Reduced weight cryolator
---
Get the chemist perk. Get super duper. Make diluted radaway.  Wear power armor. That's personally all I bother with...I walk into the zone with about 60 diluted radaway, (which only takes about 20 normal radaway plus a mess of water). I usually walk out without using half of it. 
---
The hazmat suit under the power armor trick's a nice touch for sure. 
---
If you have mutations, don't use rad-x, it suppresses them, and loosing your marsupial is a very horrible way to go in a nuke zone. I personally don't bother with anti-radiation chems, I just keep up on diluted radaway and diluted stimpacks. 
---
I feel you. I've had the account for a while but didn't start using it until recently. 
---
Gotcha. Sorry!
---
I got killed by an invincible glowing mole rat in the asylum. 😕
---
I only got one star legendaries from them also I was honestly hoping it would drop a 4 star legendary.
---
But half the time three star legendary creatures only drop one star items. Which needs to get fixed
---
Man I wish I knew this trick back when I compiled the quest. I actually stopped trying until the early dec patch that fixed a lot of my disconnect issues   
---
its pretty easy, we play the game...
---
You shouldn't. Just avoid this trash game like the fucking plague.

Where do you find this drink?

Yerch. That's unfortunate.

Seriously don't get your damage buddy, but have fun in life. 
---
Umm... you have an S. It runs games at non-4K settings as it doesn’t have 4K for gaming. Only for video. It does have HDR, but I honestly don’t know which games use HDR on the S. I have an X.
---
The X runs games in 4K as well as video. Sorry man, if you want the 4K in the games you need an X. Glad to here at least you have a 4K tv, so at least your halfway there! 
---
I wasn’t that impressed with the graphics in 76 either which is why I don’t play it (among other reasons). But it does support 4K with the right gear. 
---
Far from worth it. I regret giving BGS my money for this unfinished turd.
---
Hardly. HW and VATS don’t really go together that well.
---
I’ve played fallouts 3, new Vegas, 4, and 76. Also, I’ve played elder scrolls oblivion and Skyrim. Are you writing an article or some kind of thesis? I’m willing to share my thoughts if you want. You can PM me to figure out how to do it. 
---
The ice machine gets packed when a nuke gets dropped. I've seem people fill it up.

*why do my questions only beget more questions....* Thank you for the answer my friend 
---
I have.
---
Ditto...
---
Dude. Buy a new rifle from the market.
---
Sell shit to all the vendors for 3 days. You will afford a decent enough rifle.
---
Anything explosive/crit damage is worth around 5k to 15k. Just gotta shop around the other sub reddits and do some trading.
---
Go for Anti armor or bloodied, you should be just fine. Or if you liked the nerf weapons. There isn't anything wrong with TSE weapons.
---
Nice catch.
---
Uhhh... huh? HW and VATS don’t really go that well together. Bloodied explosive/fire rate is king with current meta... if you don’t like low-health, it’s still going to be explosive/fire rate as secondaries
---
Man fuck all these people downvoting you. They fanboy so hard over their precious trash of a game. Have my upvote.
---
Grats! That actually pretty cool, not had better than a 2 star so far at level 83. 
---
Alright! I’ll be pming you. And I’m thinking of making a video essay. But maybe as a series. 
---
Very, very excellent perspective- thanks!
---
I havent seen the welding helmet. any chance it works like the assultron helmet, closed when you have your gun out and open when you holster it?
---
Ah yes because the artists and modelers should be spending their time bug fixing, instead of you know doing their job making art assets and item/world models.
---
Or maybe BGS should do what WoW did and make you undetectable/invincible until you actually join the game begin moving? This isn't OP fault, it's Bethesda's for the 'oversight'.
---
And fix the gloves of the matching Engineer Outfit while you're at it.
---
Never actually existed, at least there was never proof and nobody was ever able to duplicate it.
---
Only ever 1 sentry bot in a nuke bunker. So that's good. And he's in a relatively open space. 
---
The only part of this shit game that worked 100% intended at launch was the ducking Atomic Shop. Fuck Bethesda and fuck their 'live service'.
---
I have one 
---
If it's so fun you'd be playing it instead of spreading your bad tastes on redit.
---
Up on the Cliffwatch side of the mountains behind top of the world. A bit further down than Cliffwatch but not as far South as approaching Whitesprings. 
---
You can get a spot naturally fortified with cliffs and funnel attackers into one place if they do ever approach. Good looting and resources too. 
---
Enjoy!
---
Sure, pm me your questions! 
---
Mommy is soooo proud of you, sweaty. Let's put this sperg out up on the fridge with all your other failures.
---
Same here. My C.A.M.P. is literally a “camp.” It’s a cook fire and a sleeping bag, with all my crafting stations around them. I’m only lvl 11 tho
---
The servers can't even handle 24 people the majority of the time, why would you ask for this?
---
Playing it right now actually. You must be busy playing a better game or sorts 😋
---
I usually drop stuff in the vendor register in Flatwoods, or leave it on the floor in the paper bag. Hope it's getting to people.
---
are these the only 4 stars to exist? never seen anything else at 4. also do 5 stars exist?
---
I'm also building near the cliff of the monorail elevator, but it's hanging on the middle of the cliff. I need to put on my PA and do the "leap of faith" into my CAMP every time I fast travel, haven't been attacked so far. 
---
Didnt even know there are 4 star weapons lol :D
---
If you are just buying for caps there is little risk. The main issue would be that you can't see the extra prefixes in the trade menu. So compare the stats from a picture of the weapon/gear with the stats you can see to be sure you are actually buying what you want.
---
If you just stick to people that have a lot of confirmed trades you will probably be fine. Like anything else though if it seems to good to be true it probably is or if the person is really pushy or trying to rush you just back off. Also stay away if they want you to give them something first and then they will give you what they want.
---
I have only traded a few times there and never had a problem personally.
---
What are you looking for by the way might be able to help you out?
---
What’s the best method to gather RadAway? Searching first aid containers or getting the recipe from the Enclave?
---
Weapon repair costs
---
I read thesestories and wonder who these people are? I've only had a few bad interactions... I'm on a PC format. I wonder if most of the a-holes play on Xbox &amp; Playstation, or if I've just been lucky?
---
Sucks dude. Maybe consider extractors and a temporary camp. Hell, even invite them to try and take you on your home turf! 
---
Hail /u/jullz-wolf. Protector of the wastes!
---
Top left hand corner, behind that lumber yard.  There's a nice flat area for building and the only things that bother you are the occasional low level interlopers.  Easily dealt with by two turrets.  Plus the lumber yard itself is a nice place to farm for materials and fusion cores, since the Super Mutants guarding the place are easy enemies.
---
I can't get either Twin Lakes nor Solomon's Pond to register... any ideas?
---
One weird trick to get aluminum. HVAC guys hate him!
---
But seriously, had no idea you could loot those. What else am I missing?
---
Honestly, I get so much just randomly exploring the map I don't think I even have the recipe. Depends on your play-style for sure. 
---
if you are melee, put on a shotgun and enforcer perk. Shoot it down and maul it to death
---
Haha such a great game. That tunnel quest was messed up. 
---
These locations have been noted...
---
Some damage is to be expected (especially since turrets occasionally ignore some enemies entirely).
---
I camp along the river near the Billings farm and experience minimal damage with 2 turrets.
---
I wish I’d known this a month ago lol. Multiple freezes and crashes meant days on that pain in the arse.
---
Thanks.
---
i havent seen such a thing in my 550 hours of play, havent played more then a few days in the past 3-4 weeks tho so id have to see a screenshot, seeing is believin.
---
Because I built my building around my farm.  I cannot lock my tato plants and corn, so I lock them inside my house.
---
Now, I tried this, and it worked, but when I went to move my camp an inch, and I have built one of those elevated camps that goes up from a 1x1 foundation for easy moving, my camp blueprint refused to place because of the 'glitched' plants. Gave me the stupid 'this must be placed on terrain' message for one of them, so, horribly, I had to rebuild the whole complicated mess from memory.
---
So what I've been doing is getting the 'glitch' plant sets built, then blueprinted, then placed, so now when I move camp I just have to remember to remove all 'glitched' objects first. Because I'm using it for my water purifier and hand pump too.  I also used a similar trick to get my decontamination arch indoors, I used one of the large rugs and placed it on that, then took it inside, because stupidly, the arch refuses to be placed on an upper floor tile, and I already had my camp attacked by a player once.  I know it was a player because I came back to all my turrets destroyed, but my crops outside at the time mysteriously untouched, and that's not how mobs operate. -_-
---
That would be the logical hope, yes, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't work like that.
---
FO76 is like your ex, you can't get over them!
---
Looking at it in a different perspective it good to have PVP in a sense it helps with personal story immersions like this one. In every waste land there is going to be bad apples how you deal with them will dictate the story. 
---
I ran into this situation and decided to seek revenge. This individual manage to get me derailed from my goals at the time and manage to get my undivided attention. He was farming near the Watoga BoS shop so I decided to fill the place with land mines and post my self on high ground with a fat Man. A fat man is not very effective, but a fat man landing in a mine field surrounded by nuclear power vehicles while the farmer is trying to get out because of the robots attacking well now that is priceless. 
---
Can’t wait for PvP servers. 
---
The vendor at the Watoga shopping center always has them now. Its 5700 caps though so start working on Hard Bargain perk if you haven't. I paid full price. It will always require COBALT FLUX &amp; VIOLATE FLUX to build.
---
Again if the pvp was better i definitely would challenge them the main thing that ruins it for me is the explosive trait weapons and mainly just legendary traits in general i honestly think they shouldn't have been added to thia game except for unique quest found weapons.
---
And extracter location could be cool i was thinking of relocating my camp anyways ill have to keep a look out for a good spot with an extracter.
---
Yeah that was certainly true for me until I went into a nuke zone at whitesprings recently. I burned through all my RadAway, so now I’m trying to get more in an efficient manner. 
---
Ugh me too. I am like dying at how not cute my 76 character is compared to my FO4 character. But at the same time when you talk about 4 layers of shit I imagine the game freezing every time I look at myself. 
---
It’s chance based 3* can drop 3,2,1*. Which is ok. It encourages you to keep hunting. 
---
You shouldn’t take any items from houses or enemy corpses, then, if looting is stealing.
---
Where did you find one anyway? seems like it would be fun to have.
---
i got you bud are you on now?
---
Anything literally anything would fit into that category. I'd rather play little big planet.
---
Yah, me and my friend have been searching for hours and no BPs, so I just went to reddit for it
---
I can help you with your issue. I know junk is a heavy burden to carry. I specialize in relieving people of their junk and caps. I am here to help. What's your gamertag? I will join your game at your convenience and let you know when I'm ready to help. Fear no more. 
---
Best comment, take my upvote
---
The first time was the last and only time for me.  I'm hesitant to call anybody a liar, but I just know it's only supposed to occur once *per character*.  If it happens on the same character twice, that must be a bug, because pretty sure it was designed to only happen under the circumstances I mentioned.
---
in a train car west of watoga station a plan can spawn ontop of wooden boxes near a skeleton siting on the floor with a sub machine gun.
---
I checked that spot every time I went to the station and eventually got it. I am on PC so I cant make it for you.
---
i sent invite
---
Holy crap, I did have a "burial at sea" for a goldfish in third grade!
---
The higher the level of the locks, the more curious people become and they want to go inside even more!
---
Anything particular you want for them?
---
I honestly can't remember. 😥
---
The wiki suggests you can find it inside Thunder Mountain Power Plant in the Mire, the Ranger District Office in the Cranberry Bog, Appalachian Antiques, and as a reward for Forbidden Knowledge.  I suspect it was probably from Forbidden Knowledge.
---
I'm retired and would put way more hours in, except I live on a boat. When I'm at anchor I run off solar panels so I can only play a few hours in the afternoon. But when we stop in a marina and plug into electricity I usually end up playing all night. I usually watch old tv shows like Cheers on my ipad at the same time I play. Shows where I know the characters so well I can listen and know who is talking without looking up from the game. If I still lived in a condo or house I'd easily have 800 hours by now.
---
After playing 76 for like 100 hours I started up a new game on fallout 4 and holy shit I have no idea how I ever dealt with vats in the old games. Well to be fair I rarely ever used them but the whole time stopping thing is so bad compared to 76s implementation.
---
It's a two shot only. No explosive. I earned my own weapon. I just had the bad luck to chase what I liked from FO4. Problem is I play like it's single player but it's EXACTLY that problem with everyone duping/farming and selling shit that got so many people so OP that Bethesda nerfed weapons and turn SBs into sponges. To have to rely on someone else farming and selling shit to even have a viable weapon is a seriously broken system. 
---
I understand you're just trying to help, but it's exactly that mindset that screwed the system up to begin with. I hardly feel like farming up 10k+ caps to feed the market that fucked the game up for us all in the first place. This game is buggy and broken enough without Bethesda focusing what little devs they seem to have on FO76 on attacking dupers inflating the market on weapons but punishing the entire player base in the process. 
---
Quit over a month ago but could craft just about everything for any pa, too many caps lol
---
There isn't anything more beautiful than a well designed plan that comes together and works. I agree with you. Pvp does add a twist of suspense to the fo76 experience. I get really bored with the grind after a few hours, and remember nothing of it unless its a good legendary drop.
---
The pvp however... a whole different story. 
---
FBI: why you taking photos of nuclear plants? You a terrorist? 
---
MyPeeSacIsFull: fake internet points?
---
Aluminum is tracked, if you get 100K in 30 days they will ban you.
---
You can get 100K with this method, Bethesda is dumb!
---
I would look at the ammo factory or either sites down by watoga. I have gotten. two full sets of t51 and t60 armor from those locations. 
---
Agreed. Gotta hand it to him tho, that last sentence bought made me wet myself. Haha

Part of me loves this idea. But the griefers wouldn't go along with it, they'd fly a responders flag and murder people who come up to RP as responders. 
---
Every time you shoot down a government cargobot, an angel loses its wings.
---
Seriously though, someone is waiting on that supply drop you just shot down, which is why it shows up as “Steal” to you.
---
Well, that depends.  Does everyone else start new too?
---
I feel like the nature of player-to-player interactions has changed since the beginning.  Not only are low-level players more skittish now, but many are just high-level players using new characters.  Plus, because the game was critically panned on release, there was an odd sense of camaraderie between those of us who played it.  Like, we all know this game has issues, but we're just trying to make do and have fun.
---
Now, I wouldn't really call it boredom, but there's kind of a mechanical ennui.  Players often ignore each other and don't even say hi.  They are less likely to spontaneously show up and help... or even ask for help for that matter because they often server hop when the going gets tough.  Many newbies beeline straight to Whitesprings.  The "mystery" of the game is gone, for now.
---
Well this isn't creepy at all, kid. 
---
You could try setting off a flare to see if you can get another player to come &amp; assist; although not everyone is friendly. I’ve used them to signal that I’d found Grahm when the challenge was to get his photo. Only 1 player came to check it out but it may be worth a shot.
---
Well, the chem scrounger perk is handy, go run through some hospital type areas. 
---
That's the whole point of the damn game... you're playing Fallout, what do you expect?
---
How'd it go?
---
Fast traveling somewhere else helps.  The bug is with you, not your teammate usually.
---
You can probably get about 1k for that.
---
Yup, you're digging through my post history and commenting on it like a creepy lil stalker. 
---
I said learn to read, not "read my entire post history" but you do you.
---
awesome thank you.
---
Are you on ps4? 
---
thanks for the info. I never really explored the bog outside of the belly of the beast quest, so I shall start there.
---
What level do you need ?
---
The double whammy is that any pc players I find who have what I want don’t trade in caps, only end game weapons 😢
---
What's your gamertag
---
Instigating +fire rate .44 revolver
---
Bloody shotgun
---
bloody handmade
---
bloody sledge hammer
---
Instigating black powder pistol (working on the kill 76 scortched thing, and why not use a good weapon while I'm doing it...one shots level 60's). 
---
Are these notifications keeping you awake?  That would be really sad.  
---
Reading your post history explains much, little snowflake.
---
Can it really be that much different now to kill things the damage drop isn't even that much. I don't know if you are on PC but I have a TSE guass rifle I don't use because I a use automatic weapons I could sell you.
---
Not everything is duped. Esp. Post nerf and ban hammer.

In an online game experience. Trading is always a key element to finish your build. The duping F'ed up the market and made everything redundant to the point of nerf. I agree with you there. But do not get the concept of trading twisted. It isn't a feature made or dominated by dupers.
---
I have around 500 hours of gameplay, and I found loads of god tier weapons, that are useless to my build. I trade/sell those with players who could use them and buy the things I need from other players in the same situation. I never duped, and had played the game completly legit until this very day. 
---
Most antiarmor/furiois and bloodied vats crit dmg weapons are 100% dupe free, considering they weren't META back at the day. 
---
Tse weapons are vaguely used, but they are definitely still usable and stand on the high scale of dps.  
---
I’m down south nearish to the ‘bear’ icon on a large body of water. Never see a soul and rarely enemies. Fast travel costs on a biatch though!
---
If there’s something in particular you’re looking for, asking on here is always a good idea. Recently someone on here who’s name eludes me right now, very kindly hooked me up with a player that could sell me an x01 jet pack mod. The trade took seconds and I couldn’t be happier.
---
Honestly, never underestimate the kindness of the fallout community.
---
Ditto.  Been pretty stable, especially since the last patch.   Literally not a single disconnect since it came out here on XBox.
---
Ive gone to drop stuff in there twice and have found loads of ammo in there so it's a common drop spot. The Overseers cache at the Overseers Camp is another popular spot.
---
John Amos Power Plant?!
---
Given the current game mechanics, the OP was at fault.  In a perfect game, things would be designed better.
---
Yep!
---
Fyi, like you. I rocked a TS combat rifle that I looted at whitesprings. I then decided to buy a new rifle and find a new build that had the least effect to my rifle build.
---
I guess the hope is that all the PvPers jump on the PVP servers and leave us PvE Enthusiasts alone.
---
There's no way you haven't gotten a single 3 star drop at level 83. I don't doubt they were all shit and not worth using but that is a different story.
---
It’s mad too see so many people selling items I give away for free lol
---
You still didn't tell us why your reading posts about a game you can't stand. Guess it's your guilty pleasure.
---
I built there once! Only kept my camp for a day though. Saw a Mothman and 3 trios of Super Mutant Warlords in that time lol.
---
Was kinda spooky too, being so far away from "civilization"
---
He just tried it and it worked thanks a lot man.
---
Ditto. Have mine set up like a mini motel for just that reason.
---
As of now nothing over 3 star can drop.
---
Ik right 13 k sitting there doing nothing
---
It's worth noting that you can repair the Damaged Mainframe Cores.  There's a Tinkerer's Workbench on that level and you can find the repair option under "Quest Items."  It makes that part go a lot faster because you don't need to find all the tedious hidden cores.
---
The code itself, yeah.  I get what they were going for, but they just went too far with it.  The problem with the decryption is that even if you understand the process, there's *still* ambiguity because sometimes the scrambled letters can resolve to more than one word.  You simply have no idea which word is right, and the cost of failure is having to do the entire silo over again.  Even if I did it manually, I'd still double check it at Nuka Crypt.
---
Some of the peripheral stuff is annoying too, like shooting down the Cargobot with the Nuclear Keycard.  That thing has an absurd amount of HP for what it is.  There's nothing challenging about acquiring it - you just have to stand there shooting over and over again.
---
I also don't like, and don't really understand, the need to create a Biometric ID card every time.  That's one step I could do without.  You do this, the system greets you with "Welcome, General," but the robots continue to attack you?
---
My C.A.M.P. is positioned above a super mutant camp in a small building, kind of fun to aggro then and watch my rocket turret just clean the place out.
---
You have to do one for each SPECIAL. Click on the challenge itself and it will show you which ones you've done and which ones you haven't. Good luck!
---
I have one room in my house that is locked. It has my fusion generator and decontamination shower in it. It is only locked to try to protect them from being damaged.
---
I did see someone look around my house, and then proceed to pick the lock, looked around, then stripped naked and knelt down to have their bounty removed. It was odd.
---
Mine's stuck at 2 as well... challenge seems bugged.
---
Tldr: 3* weapons. 1 sniper day to day quest. 1 heavy hitting ranged weapon for SBQ 1 2 hand melee
---
Honestly just some better weapons. Most of my stuff is 1or 2 star mid level kinda stuff. Tried various perks, armor, builds and feel like I'm just wasting ammo doing minimal damage. Too many bullets to take out super mutants, barely dent SBQ. I generally like a ranged sniper build but I've been adapted to 76 and go with melee power armor build mostly. I wouldn't mind something that would help against SBQ. I can run high or low health depending on perks for day to day quest and such. 
---
PS4 if I haven't mentioned.
---
Good doggo.
---
Someone jizzed on my plushy 
---
Actually you’re correct,  I have a 3 star robot chest piece. It’s that pants I’d forgotten about it lol.
---
Awesome! OH, now I see the Poca Middle School sign.  I've driven by the plant many times.  I grew up in Hurricane.
---
I really like the idea of anything goes pvp, but I think I'd trade it for stronger coop and an end to three obsession with balancing games. We like fallout games because it's fun to become infinitely more powerful and have really goofy builds 
---
Yeah I noticed that but I’ve done multiple in every category. There are other broken challenges too, like taking photos in the forest region which doesn’t work at all and learning cooking recipes which is stuck at 5 even though I’ve learned 40 or so and learning new ones now doesn’t change the count... It’s gonna drive me crazy if it isn’t fixed before I finish the ones that work properly.
---
What a nerd.. its blowing up my redit app with this garbage. That's ok though I'm glad you can show me how smart you are. Go play your shit game now and stop playing pocket pool with your daddy.
---
BTW, the drill does respectable damage if you repair it to 200% with weapon artisan.
---
I thought the point was implicit in my reply, but to be direct, my friend got the game as a gift upon release, which was over 90 days ago. 10 hours a day, seven days a week gets you to 900 hours easily. 
---
Between Harpers Ferry and the National Isolated Radio array (big satellite dish).  
---
In the middle of this area there are two sections that are on running streams, the first one is near the big flower symbol and North. The second is a bit North of Site Alpha.  The banks along the streams are like small cliffs and it’s easy to protect an area with concrete barriers. 
---
I have had my camp in this area for the last two months.  My neighbors are a family of level 2 foxes, with the occasional low level wandering scortched, super mutants, wolves, and a few radrats.   They only show up when I am in camp and are easily dispatched. 
---
I’ve only ever had to repair my concrete barriers (those radrats are tough little guys) and a few crops (distant gunfire from super mutants).
---
What’s the stars on it and what all are they and what level. I might want it
---
yes poor bessy was the same way till i moved to a different location where she is safe
---
Don't understand how damage reduction is "fun." Bloodied either. Swing Speed can be considered fun tho, but that's probably the least likely to take a hit. Also Unyielding is kinda fun, but that's probably high priority
---
Yeah, I've ended up selling most of my drops to vendors. Hanging on to a few 2 and 3 * bits but thinking of just selling them too...
---
We need an online auction house, just like every other MMO 🤬
---
The people who want PvP will do so. The people who want to mess with people will not. It's way easier to grief people who aren't specced out for PvP and you can bet that people on Survival will be better geared for that.
---
I have played all fallout games except tactics. 
---
I've used a few. When you mod a weapon or armor, if you have a mod than you'll get the option to attach it rather than craft a new one. I sell almost all the ones I find though.
---
Safe zones are for Care Bears. Stay away from survival mode,
---
It's not a ruptured canister is it?
---
Quad lever action I'm 1-shotting a lot of stuff with. That's for gun. If I'm actually in a pinch, I pull out my anti armor handmade. I have a TSE laser, but I'm waiting for them to fix laser weapons before I really use it.
---
I had the same issue too (5/7), but then discovered I needed to fully level a perk card for Endurance and one for Agility. Once I leveled both, I completed the challenge and got that sweet Atom! :)
---
As for the cooking recipes, I know what you mean. I started another character and now I'm around 63/76. Maybe I need to start a third character to get it completed.
---
Given the *broken* mechanics.
---
FTFY
---
Nah, I only sit on reddit when I'm bored. Keep going, I consistently rant at griefers, make comments on various subjects, and generally am a consistent human being. People who go out of their way to make games less fun for others, bad. Idiots who can't read, bad.  Neat and novel suggestions that would make the game better, good. 
---
Over and over and over again, pretty much. 
---
I've contemplated doing this, but I'd be concerned about random enemies shooting the various workbenches.
---
Yes, I see it quite clearly in your picture.
---
Hi! I am also on ps4 with one ps friend that rarely plays fallout! as a lvl 21 noob I like people like you. Encounters in this games are indeed really fun! Continue like that man!
---
Everytime this happens to me I have to relog into the world. The one who I can't see usually stays invisible until I relog. This is of course how it works for when it happens to me I'm sure it's all kinds of screwy for other people at times lol
---
Awesome! Glad it worked out. 
---
That's a absolutely mind-boggling hope from my perspective. There aren't that many PVP players, the vast majority of people who engage in PVP are griefers who actively and intentionally target the non-pvp playing majority.
---
Why would the sociopathic fringe leave their hunting grounds? 
---
Because I'm a neurotic piece of shit who is paranoid even in a video game. 
---
Interesting... I wonder if anyone would mind me farming crops on the driving range?
---
Awwwww dude thats such a good idea! I cant wait to speck into a true sniper build :)))))
---
i’ve played oblivion, skyrim, fallouts 4 &amp; 76, wolfensteins 1 &amp; 2 if you need more input
---
I'm not asking how people get time. I'm asking content wise how do they get the incentive to grind this specific game that much. 
---
What's your build? Bloodied weapons with adrenal mutation? 
---
We don't all have daddy issues, sorry. Your mom was right when she said you were special, just not the way you thought she meant it
---
Alright fair enough go away loser.
---
Yes. Bloody mess lv 3, maxed rifle perks too 
---
Newbie here with noob question, wouldn't the griefer have a wanted mark on him on  the map after killing the 45 multiple times?
---
Ike it always makes games better
---
D FIELDS
---
How much?
---
Sometimes it's a matter of where you are in a location.
---
I've found that if there's a sign for a location, it's often a good spot for a picture.  Otherwise, some locations seem to be bugged.
---
I love my unyielding build. I love consistently having to be on my toes. I love having to use cover to avoid bullets, I love having the insanely high damage, carry weight, AP, and low purchase/high sale prices in vendors. 
---
My unyielding/bloodied build is a true glass cannon. Land one good hit on me and I'm done...and same if I land a hit on just about any mob in the game, beyond multi-star legendary enemies and scorch beasts. 
---
What is this being used for? I don't think you made that clear.
---
Yeah that sounds like a great idea. Like I said,  I have a furious lite machine gun and it works pretty well but has seen very little use because it's just not feasible because of the way ammo works in this game.
---
But this is something that should have been addressed long ago- like when the game was in development.   For this and a multitude or reason I am feeling less and less inclined to play it.
---
Just the sheer fact of coming into a forum for a game you don’t play exceeded energy...
---
Every time I think I’d like no chance of getting killed by players I realize how much it adds to the desperate survival element of the game. 
---
I’ve never initiated contact, but I kinda sorta like not knowing if I’m dealing with assholes when I encounter them.
---
Tonight I got buttfucked by 3 fandoms at Harpers Ferry. Really shitty timing because I’d just cleared a handful of level 68 Super Mutants, and was patching myself up when they engaged.
---
I popped one of them with my black powder rifle and ran for the train cars where I hit chameleon until they got tired of looking for me.
---
My first thought was “fuck those guys” and then I thought, “actually that was kinda cool.”
---
Same thing later when I had a fresh, unlooted high school all to myself. After gathering about 80 plastic I hid from other players because I knew all they had to do was kill me after I did the looting for them
---
Honestly, having it craftable in larger batches isn't likely to have a negative impact on the game.  Sure snipers use .308, but it isn't like we carry that much of the crap around and our fire rate is already so low that farming a few hundred rounds is a cakewalk.
---
Having the ability to make them in 5mm quantities wouldn't really change my gameplay much at all.  
---
Also how the fuck to they explain making the LMG (even one based off the mg42) fire faster than a minigun?  Rotary cannon outstrip the fire rates of every mechanical firearm in existance.  #sadfaceminigunfan
---
Thats very true and why I called it "hope" - becuase thats all it its :(
---
I'm by Watoga just east of the relay tower. Beautiful spot. Lots of water. Been there a few weeks and attacked by wolves and dogs only. Oh and the Flatwoods monster once. 
---
It does not flip down like the assaultron helmet like I hoped.
---
Ps the atom shop people is it’s own crew. They have different teams for each thing. One operates the atomic shop and the others work on the game
---
40. How much?
---
I once punched a behemoth to death!
---
That’s not true, I just wanted to join in.
---
LMAO at being six months post beta and people STILL DONT UNDERSTAND THE BASIC PREMISE OF A POST-APOCALYPTUC WASTELAND. Resources- few. People-all dead. Stuff plus nuke= no stuff. 
---
Who all is getting paid by metacritic, ign, Gamespot?
---
This is why I still love this game. I'm not the person who did this, I usually fill up the overseer's cache in Flatwoods andrandomly scatter higher level things throughout the map, but I love to see that people are finding these things. I always hope that the things I leave are picked up and don't end up gone if no one comes and the server crashes. This community is awesome, even if there are a few jerks.
---
Mine is cliffside overlooking the crashed space ship. Hardly any enemies spawn there. 
---
3* Furious/Vats Crit/Vats cost combat rifle for PVP. 3* TSE handmade for PVE.
---
I bet that looks really cool at night.
---
Too many brahmin have been lost due to their careless hunting. 
---
I typed less words than you. I have won. 
---
No. I would not go if there is a player icon on it. 
---
Finally a real answer 
---
My camp is in that same spot (Site Alpha) but you will get the occasional scorchbeast.  When that happens I just log out otherwise the SB will destroy the camp. 
---
I’m on the PS4 and have played quite a bit over the last month and haven’t found it to be toxic, just the opposite.   FYI.  I don’t think that you mentioned the platform that you are playing on.  
---
I have run into a couple of players who killed me at two of the Workshops that I claimed.  I grabbed the workshops for the same reason as you, needing materials.  I just left that world and joined another because I too am not interested in PVP.  I find it too unbalanced. 
---
As for the interaction with the other players, you have to take people as you find them.  Most are friendly and open, I’ve had good experiences. 
---
It would be nice to see the LMG be useful. I've got a few I've stashed in case they ever become worthwhile again. Tbh the game is still in beta. Bethesda has always been slow to fix things (if they ever do). 
---
This is the most intense 1v1 story I've read so far. 
---
Keep fighting the good fight for us low-level players. 
---
Well maybe they should worry more about making a *working product* instead of trying to take more money from our wallets?
---
&gt; Honestly, having it craftable in larger batches isn't likely to have a negative impact on the game. 
---
My thoughts exactly. 
---
The ammo situation really does raise a question: why did they include this weapon in the game at all?
---
Seriously. I have NEVER seen anyone using one.  Heavy weapons are a regular staple in Scorch Beast Queen fights, and the light machine gun is the only one that have HAVE NEVER SEEN ONCE. 
---
There's a reason for that and that reason is ammo.
---
I remember you other post! Wish I could come but I’m on Xbox:(
---
They’re also used a bit in some camp/workshop things (turrets I think? And maybe repairing those AA missile turrets?) but they don’t get nearly the volume usage that other things do.
---
Just picked one up in Watoga.  You can have it.  I'll be playing for a couple more hours, gamer tag dracos2112
---
Mine is a bit North North East upstream of Site Alpha.  I’ve never seen a SB.  Not once.   South or West of Site Alpha might be a bit different. 
---
Depends on how far you want to go with this. Is it your main weapon, you're doing a build around? Stack strength. Get your two handed melee cards, get +1str gear, or unyielding gear, and if you go with unyielding, get the endurance card that adds str for high radiation. 
---
take psychobuff. Eat food that adds +str, and all the +damage food you can get (glowing meat, etc). 
---
We can't enter a silo when it is producing a missile. 
---
Player icon disappears if he is in stealth or block all players .
---
.... why? To make life easier for you? You’re trying to survive a post-apocalyptic wasteland, it’s not supposed to be easy. And it makes actual sense the way it is, vs your “convenience” ideas. 
---
No. He was killing him through the workshop claiming process. Then he would step out, so the workshop would return to the level 45.
---
 Rinse and repeat.
---
I hope my bear collection will look good
---
The first run through i loved every minute of it. The cute little dorky robots that come out that you have to protect made me happy as hell. The whole launch room felt right. To top it off the way you get out in the special elevator blew my mind completely and made me so damn happy. The only annoying part was getting one of my dense buddies through the first ID check point. We had to redo the process for him 3x before he actually did what we told him to do. Any time you go in with someone new its pretty great.
---
Though going it alone kills your soul. Also every time i entered the thing someone always cheated the codes. I couldn't imagine doing it myself.
---
I totally agree, I couldn't give two shits about PvP, make a dedicated PvP server and leave us the fuck alone.
---
Yeah I’ve got a bunch of maxed card in each category.
---

---
There’s little to nothing more you can do to the weapon itself. At this point it’s just perks and mutations and deciding if you want to go all-in with an low health build (Unyielding-Radicool-Adrenal Reaction-Nerd Rage.)
---
What does sacrificial blade do?
---
I’ve played 3,4 nv and 76! Let me know if you need anything
---
Proximity chat with time gated pip boy private message is ok (like you can send private msg once per few minutes to each other unique player). Map-wide megaphone garbage is not. That thing always gets run over by bots, trolls, trade spam. We dont need extra channels for toxic bndwagon to chime in. 
---
Run a bloodied build. It’s exactly that. You have 1/5 the health and about 3x the damage output. 
---
You can negate the explosive traits nowadays with the fireproof perk and dense on your chest piece.  Take almost no damage from explosive weapons with the perk/armor combo.
---
I used to always lock my private residence area, leaving the general workshop area open.  But I've spent a lot of time decorating my little retreat, and I'd like to share it with anyone who happens to pass by.
---
Just post your link in the text post... I don't get what the big deal is. 
---
North and East of there is a nice burd watching place. Found an oil and an acid up there too. And random tents. Amazing what you can find in the outreaches.
---
I have all the slugger cards and they’re all max out. I have pretty high strength too. (Like around 15 points of it lol and I carry lots of physco with me.) my goal is to atemsst get it too 1500-2000 damage. I heard the highest is 4000.
---
I think it was from forbidden knowledge as I don't remember picking it up.
---
Just posted link to pics on a separate post, let me know if you can't find it!
---
Im on xbox most of my encounters have been ok but this was the first encounter i had since i started playing again and yeah it was pretty toxic, i stayed in the same session and was just scavenging materials they didn't really bother me i think they just pvp hungry i even went back to the workshop after a while and it was still claimed by them but it had no resource nodes on it it was just sitting there being wasted.
---
I have all the mutations that deal with improved damage. And it still somehow remains to be low.
---
I had to do some tinkering with my TV settings. 
---
Ohh i didnt know fire proof effects explosive damage as well im definitely going to have to invest into it.
---
Lol. He just posts this under every comment. Hilarious. If they cured cancer, this kind of guy would be commenting on how everyone is still dying so why even keep breathing. 
---
Ahhhh maybe thats why. I’m south of Alpha along that stream. About halfway between there and the BBQ joint. Maybe I’ll move to your area.
---
That's generally with ghoulish/stealth builds. 
---
If I have it free
---
Give me a few
---
Never understood the point of the quantity of * . No offence but a 2* with good effects is way better than that roll.
---
Yeah I think I'm just bitter that the second I'd built myself up strong enough solo to take SBs with ease and prep a nuke to make serious attempts at SBQ runs I got blindsided by that patch. Farming drops got so much harder and created a bigger gap between the have and have nots. Doesn't help that both SBQ runs I joined the server crashed, once at 20 and once at 10%. Hundreds of rounds and stimpacks wasted. Hence my shelving the game since...
---
Downvote OP into oblivion!
---
Why did you make another post?
---
Your servers just really slow
---
Your such a great person! :)
---
The cap limit's a real hindrance to using caps as a legitimate form of exchange. We're in a barter economy where the only viable currency are other, userful, items. 
---
If you are using the "open" model, as opposed to the extended frame version, it may be too close to the wall. Try moving it. This happened to me last week.
---
I clear out Blackwater Mine. I get steel for ammo and plenty of other scrap inside and out. Pick up all the glowing meat and cook it with super duper on. Decent, quick xp and caps. I've also found a few PA mods on the shelves in the shed with the weapons workbench.
---
Yeah no, don't go after workshops, they're pretty much exclusively used by griefers to target other players now, they don't produce nearly enough materials to be worth taking at all. Bethesda's fucked over the entire concept multiple times, each change making them less and less worth it for your average player. 
---
You can only do that if you're on a team right?
---
Lay off the jet man.
---
(PS4) When my teammates tell me I'm invisible, I just take an armor item off and on and they say it's all good
---
There has to be enough space behind it for your avatar to crouch there in the animation and then the repair menu will open.
---
Somebody please downvote this guy so he gets -76 upvotes
---
The thing is it dont make sense.. nobody will make it ... Why chose that number 760hours would have been better dont you tink?
---
Pretty sweet! My current camp is on the cliffs above the mine just north of there. Will come by and visit if I happen to be on the same server :) 
---
I’m hoping the Nukashine recipe coming in the update next week does this in a cheaper way. I find it better to just drink Whiskey and use cola nut to refresh my AP. 
---
I know I’m in the minority here. But blowing up camps with my TSE is so fun. I don’t care about the caps 
---
It's just simply a poorly built game when a mongrel stretches across the screen becoming untargetable regularly on a constant basis and they mispatch items because they are too doped up to read the correct item. When the game allows for 95 percent damage reduction on players vs player encounters, simply just for not moving. Also Grants autotargeting on players so each other can talk about how good they are for killing "insert fellow trash player name here" it is by far the worst game I have played on ps4 since its launch. 
---
I put as many of the kitty pictures on the walls as I can
---
No problem.  Bloodied = increasing damage the lower your health.  The second legendary affix is anytime you block an incoming melee attack you return 50% of the damage to the attacker.
---
I never use melee so I'm willing to dish this guy pretty cheap.  Maybe 250-300 caps?  
---
Actually funny enough I use ghoulish! And I have the secret agent perk along with ninja.
---
She's from 94 I was able to zoom in with a scope.
---
Yeah thats the vibe im getting from them now i dont like the fact that you can contest anywhere from the workshop now instead of the table itself it makes it really hard to build up a defense.
---
I mainly use them cause i like building stuff and having a set up even if its temperary and the passive income is nice to and when i use to play i did attack and take over other workshops sometimes but that was because i wanted to resources on that particular workshop but other than how it use to be i agree its mainly used to openly attack other players. I hope the survival mode fixes alot of this stuff.
---
It's not "the best" but it is indeed very good! 
---
Noted.
---
If you have 15 players show up to fight the queen , walk away.  It’s not happening.  Her DR scales to the number of players in the event area.
---
You’re better off with two organized teams of 6-8 heavy hitters.  Killed the queen twice yesterday.  16 minutes and 12 minutes.
---
She's from 94 I was able to zoom in with a scope if I remember correctly. There's another in an elevator in Berkeley Springs as well
---
The stream divides at my camp, one goes South East down the hill to Site Alpha and one to the South West.   It sounds like you are further down the South West spur.   Assuming my orientation isn’t off by a bit...
---
My camp is in visual distance of Site Alpha, but it’s far enough upstream that you can’t “see” it without looking though a rifle scope.   It’s weird to look up the hill and see nothing then look through a scope and see it being rendered by the game.   I think that it has something to do with the perception level.  
---
Assumed I was doing so little damage because of the level difference and him standing still and just turning after I hit him. For context, I was a level 6, while he was 90+
---
I was on the same boat. If you want to stay on the same build, you could simply just do what I did.
---
I maxed out the rifle perks and tank killer, added bloody mess, got adrenal reaction and a bloodied weapon and I was one shotting everything and anything.
---
It took a few levels to move around the points and buy the perks, 8 levels and I was sorted out. I got myself first a bloodied explisove lever action for 1.5k from a very generous player who valued the stash space more than the weapon. 
---
It’s strange in numbers.
---
Today less then 5 mins after i finish my new base near whitesping it gets nuked...
---
Yep. I killed my left knee and spent 2500 hours in FO4. It happens. Even playing a little almost daily since beta and I am only at 275 in 76. Injury = insane play time. 
---
You can't tame "monsters" that are spawned for specific events, including those comedy spawns.  So if you can tame cats (I have no idea if you can!) it can't be one of those.
---
1000X level eye-rolling so i downvoted you. Reddit should be for fun please take yourself out of it.
---
I'm on PC and it's been pretty rare in the last month for me to get disconnected. Maybe three times total.
---
We need him in game.  Like mysterious stranger but revived you with Nyla cola if Down :)
---
Back in beta I got nuked 8 times back to back. The area south of flatwoods the valley for some reason people kept nuking it. In hindsight everyone was setting up their camp there. 
---
Honestly I would be fine if they just loaded the shop with tons of stuff. We earn lots of atoms and most stuff is not too expensive and the stuff that is isn't hard to save up for. 
---
No wall you see his health drop then regenerate like wolverine 
---
I have to agree with that. Games let me to switch off my overworked brain and relax. 
---
define low?
---
A more positive contribution would be simply say this:
---
Hey guys i'm getting tired of PVP can we friend up and play together and protect each other? Here is my schedule, contact info, a little bit about me let's win together!
---
Interesting..... I must steal this at once!
---
To be fair, uts not a very funny joke
---
Mine are always open. Anyone is free to come in and use the facilities😉
---
I have all of those things and a completely modded guns and not doing anywhere near that kinda damage.
---
With about 40% health gone a hardened lever action is only doing 171 damage for me. Maxed rifleman perks, max bloddy mess.
---
How are you getting weapons with those kinda numbers?
---
PSNid Enterres level 150's call me in if you want a heavy harpoon.
---
Do you listen at all?
---
They never said it was going to have NPC's, dialogue options or that you would have any impact on the story. In fact they said this game would NOT have that. It was sold as an "adventure with your friends" type of game, and thats precisely what we got.
---
If you expected something else, that is entirely on you for not doing your homework (IE extremely light googling) before paying 60 bucks. 
---
I got what I researched, I'm not mad. Slightly disappointed. But I know the game's now pretty minor bugs are getting patched soon. Long as it gets fixed I'm not mad. If you're mad...yeah join the club no one's really listening to you at this point. It gets fixed when it gets fixed. There's more to producing/fixing a console game than most people comprehend. Shit takes time and money, and costs millions of dollars per console update. (Sony/microsofts rules, not theirs) So they have to bundle as much as they can into each update WHILE under pressure to get it out RIGHT FUCKING NOW from all you 14 year old's unrealistic expectations. 
---
If you felt like you wasted your time/money, why are you crying about it here? 210 hours is on you buddy. Entirely. Are you saying it wasn't enjoyable? Then why did you play for 210 hours!?
---
210 hours of entertainment  for $60 is more than a lot of games can claim. Hell that beats netflix's entertainment to cost ratio. I doubt you watch 210 hours of Netflix in 4 months. I mean its not like you live with your Mom and have no job. (Hey we've all been there).
---
There should simply be a separate measurement for Junk Decorations. Like a limit of 100 items, regardless of and separate from your C.A.M.P.'s budget.
---
They clearly figured they could turn fallout into another knock off of some kinda rust-esque survival game.. I think everyone pretty much figured that easily. 
---
The problem is they just aren't willing to accept that a lot of the Fallout fanbase plays fallout FOR FALLOUT.  Not one of those stupid games that this was meant to emulate. I think it's almost an ego thing at this point to keep pushing for it.
---
I did it! Took we all night of grinding but I built my excavator armor and got the plans. Thanks!
---
my thoughts are that it doesn't make logical sense that i have the power to build an outpost that is literally invincible.... 
---
it doesn't.
---
i understand the desire to make such a base
---
but i don't understand how i could become so powerful in the 76 simulation that i could do so. turrets with infinite firing? ok, fine, i somehow gain the ability to make these because of the C.A.M.P. technology.. but invincible? Seems to defeat all of the lore of everything in the game that we have to fight and eliminate ultimately in order to be able to rebuild america.
---
Sit boo boo sit. Good dog.
---
Oh right, except you, you are perfect.
---
Well it goes around 275. With sheiks it does more then with shield it does more then 300.
---
That's exactly what happens to me at Harpers ferry.
---
Nope, go for it 
---
"Nah! I'm just gonna poke around the reactor and mine uranium in the parking lot!"
---
I totally get it- but i do know it is possible to solo a nuke launch. Watched Oxhorn do this on youtube, i think it took him 2 tries because he disconnected but that was a few partches ago.
---
"Sacrifice Fitness, LLC"
---
The fuck kind of company is that? 
---
But I hate people. Especially the bethesda devs. I'm allowed to be angry.
---
Slap damage had been proven multiple timed now to be capped at 5 dmg, even with 240k attack power. If you dont flag or cap workshops your safe from pvp, stimpaks will heal throigh slap dmg.
---
SBQ kills still happen aswell, but it takes more strategy like the cyrolater/endargerol than pure brute strength like before. If you get a few &lt;50 or undergeared folks taggin along your likely going to fail. I thought I read she gets 50k hp per person.
---
People have been paid to troll more obscure forums than this, about way less important shit. Its a big business, and they don't exactly advertise in the Sunday paper.
---
But just consider it, if you knew of a way to increase your customer base for stupid cheap and very little effort... i mean there are people who sit around and do this all day on the other side of the world for almost no money.
---
It would be cool if we could have User defined sets of cards that we could switch all at once to go back and forth between combat, exploration, C.A.M,P. ect. It takes way too long to swap cards in and out one by one.  
---
Won’t argue that. Just had never seen a 4 star before. 
---
Maybe he really needed your decontamination shower...
---
Ok, first. Is your weapon bloodied?
---
Second, did you re-apply the adrenal reaction mutation since the last patch?
---
Cool, thanks for the info 
---
You want to solo the silo?  Here’s the easiest way: throw on the grounded mutation, if you don’t have it go on the Reddit market and pick up a dose—it makes the run very easy.  Then put on level 3 lock pick, hacking, and sneak.
---
Enter the silo, sneak and hack the terminal in the first room. Remove the target restrictions on the turrets.  Then just walk through the first set of objectives.  Nothing in this part should do enough damage to really hurt you.
---
Next is the reactor, if you’re in PA this part is also very easy.  Pop a diluted Rad X, sneak in and kill the two gutsy robots floating around, hack the terminal, remove the targeting restrictions.  Enter the main area and hug the left wall.  You might have to kill a turret and possibly an assaultron,  but the chaos usually lets you walk past until you get to the locked door.  Pick it, walk into the second room, kill the two turrets in there, hack the terminal, open the door.  Keep going.
---
Next section is the mainframe.  Same deal, sneak and hack.  Two terminals this time.  One right inside, one through the first laser grid and then the door on the left.  This part you have to click on enough cores to clear all the laser grids.  Just watch out for assaultrons.  As long as you have grounded on everything else in this section is pretty tame.  Watch for the invisible assaultron when you leave this section.  It will be waiting just outside the door, or patrolling the tunnel through which you have to walk.
---
The next section is probably the most difficult.  Kill the turrets and robots in the first room with the weapon bench.  Pick the locked door (this is the last time you’ll use lockpick so feel free to change the perks out). Hack the turrets.  The next room has the sentry bot, assaultrons, and gutsy robots with the anti armor bullets.  You have to check the computer, take the damaged cores, and craft new cores.  Unless you want to scrounge for them.  Which you don’t.  You need steel and circuits (they can be in your stash), head to the nearby tinker bench, knock out 15 new cores, put them in the slots, use the terminal to open the door.  The guards never stop spawning here so just be fast.
---
Last part:  hack the last terminal before the dark room.  Turn the turrets off this time.  Go in and head directly left up to the platform and take out the assaultron up there.  Start the launch prep at the nearby terminal.  Kill guards until the meter fills.  Insert card, put in your code, drop nuke.
---
With a little practice you’ll be dropping solo nukes in under half an hour.
---
Even my framerate is pretty good too.
---
I’m on pc and didn’t get dc’d all day today. Sorry that’s happening to you.

If I come across someone inside their locked camp, I will actively make a commotion outside (like drop an orbital strike) so they come out to investigate. Then I'll sneak in while the door is open and go invisible in a corner. Then I shoot flairs at them with pacifist mode on while they're crafting. 
---
Worked for me earlier, I was chopping up ghouls on server after server. 
---
Recipe for RadAway (don’t recall where I learned it):
---
2 x Antiseptic
---
3 x glowing fungus
---
1 x plastic
---
1 x purified water
---
well. one working vendor in the production wing is what i meant, but thanks
---
Log out and load in new server until you hit 50. Carry a weapon that's mid-range between damage and speed of fire (I roll with a handmade on my rifle build). Run for cover if you're ranged, run under them if you're short ranged (they'll often land when you're nearly under them if there is room). They're not as bad as they used to be.
---
Its what many of us who protested a lot and many left the game after a too hard nerf imo. I have adapted but its cost close to 50k to change enough to stand a chance in queen fights- and y-day i got a awesome 1* auto stim marine leg from the sbq and the useless regular plans. It feels awesome (sarcasm) now a days its almost impossible to take her down except in a group of players. 
---
I was messing with trying to make auto closing doors last night. Wouldn't the mobs trigger the pressure plate anyway?
---
High-level weapon repair. Deathclaw gauntlet as one example. 
---
The next time you see this can you get someone else to come to you to verify if THEY see it or not? A corrupted texture on your end wont show on another person's game unless their local texture files are also broken, which is unlikely unless you/they are running the same mods. 
---
If they also see what you do, it's not a glitch. 
---
But most people was happy with the nerf , online games are like that sometime . Cant get all you want
---
Mainly mobs since my door is ground level, but since I’ve moved, I’m going to redo it and not lock anything. Because shoot if you made it that far to my camp because you went exploring, enjoy, rest repair and please don’t destroy my CAMP or pet plastic flamingo. 
---
My camp is hidden in a part of the map that few travel to. Even then, I have the door locked, so nobody can go in and destroy my rad shower. 
---
I do, however, have a second stash box, second weapon workbench, extra bed, and extra instrument outside my front door so *if* someone finds my camp, and they're in trouble, they have a slight refuge. I have windows on all my walls, so anyone curious can walk around and see the inside, but theres a section of the house without windows, that hides the rad shower, purifiers, and fusion generator.
---
They’re just single use mods vs plans, but with the mods you don’t need materials. Really helps with stuff like power armor if you don’t need have 5000 caps to buy calibrated shock plans. A lot of them can be sold for a good bit, I usually sell them unless it’s something I need. 
---
LARPing a beta tester isn't fun you're doing their work for them, also you're horribly bad at it.
---
Well i hate you, and i'm also allowed to be angry. You inspire me to raider more often until you either leave the game or step up.
---
(Repost) If C.A.M.P was pacifist, it would sustain minimal/reduced damage just like the character (against players). I'm only talking Versus other players, not the common enemies. That reduced damage, would also maybe give you the time needed to change over your settings to defend. 
---
Launched my first yesterday. We had about 10 people there. Everyone was above 50 except one lvl 26.
---
Huge fat failure. The queen not only seemed to freeze on the ground twice, but took zero damage most of the fight. Initially maybe a tenth of her bar came off them just stopped. She flew off and came back fully healed so we just left. 
---
I have no idea what went wrong. 
---
Most of the ones I see are generic gamer tags consisting of two random words and a bunch of numbers. 
---
Lock your doors. Set up turrets and traps. Appalachia is not all sunshine and daisies, can’t expect the world to work you. The first thing I do in my camp is scrap and store. If I get killed, I lose nothing. That being said, I’ve never been attacked in my own camp and it’s hard to see how this can be a recurring issue for any player. But that’s just a theory. A GAME THEORY. 
---
Yeah there's going to be those assholes who exploit it to create FPS bombs...
---
Yes, you. What you said was gross and you should feel bad.
---
1. Bugs are generally annoyance-level. Some users still report connection issues, but it's nothing like it once was, and most of the game breakers are largely gone.
---
2. Deluxe edition is not really worth it, as all it has is basic in-game American decor.
---
3. The 1/2/3 deal expired shortly after being announced.
---
4. Player interaction is basic emotes (very basic) and/or voice chat. VATS is live action, takes some getting used to, but is workable.
---
New content still a week or so away, so I'd wait. Check out the roadmap they revealed to see what's coming soon.
---
Green Suitcase inside the Morgan Town train depot is my go to for dropping off hot soup, duplicate plans, stimpaks, low level weapons and ammo that the scorch really didn’t need. I’m only a level 32, but damm I remember when I was hurting at level 8 over there because I was reckless and discovered the green suitcase ammo fairy. Been returning the favor ever since.
---
Nuka Cola even.
---
grabbed it.
---
Wait they have the nuka world nukas in 76?
---
Actually lasers do have recoil because you are still launching a particle with mass. Granted the recoil in the games are grossly exaggerated they wouldn’t be recoil less 
---
I'm sure someone could make one for you. Probably at the cost of caps.
---
What happens if your killed inside shop boundaries? Instant claim? 
---
Ok, let me reword this:
---
Maybe Bethesda could stop putting so many resources into the Atomic shop and put those resources into fixing their shit. 
---
Do you understand now?
---
And this would greatly help our beloved vendors!
---
Yay! Carrot and corn soup!
---
Omg you saw the Flatwoods monster! Super jealous! 
---
What's u gr8 I'll swing by to talk and see what u have to trade or sell
---
There are numerous receivers for the handmade, Just for reference the base damage (without any rifleman or commando perks) for a L45 Two Shot are:
---
Standard (semi-auto) = 64
---
Hardened (semi-auto) = 77
---
Powerful Automatic = 70 
---
Keeping in mind that currently post-nerf the Two Shot adds +25% damage over a standard Handmade.
---
I didn't know that adding a mod could add a star. That's awesome!
---
Some people just have that grinder's mentality. As of now while typing this, I have been fishing for like three hours straight in Minecraft.
---
I don't lock my camp. I only lock my steep extractor. I like seeing people at my camp. It's nice to show tourists the neighborhood. Maybe have a jam sess with them. If I did lock my door, I'd have my workbenches outside. But I think they deserve to be inside, in my unlocked house. So people can sleep to regen, watch the electric snow, and maybe listen to my jukebox. 
---
For me it’s a digital wasteland zen garden. Like Minecraft with something more. Sometimes I just log on and go rummage for scrap, tweak my CAMP. Sometimes look for PA upgrades because I decided to add another suit to the armor collection. Then a nuke will get dropped and I may just skip the nights plan and go get me some flux. My fav is to track down newbs and load them with a care package complete with tricked auto pop pistol with a wad of ammo, and whatever known plans I’ve collected.
---
I don’t know reliable but fort defiance has a spawn. On the third floor in the room with all the crafting stuff. If you go up the elevator and take a left out of it, go down the hall and at the end there is a door on your right. Right before that door it can spawn on top of the Weapons workbench (I think that or a big box). It’s right on the corner. It’s a possible mod spawn, so if you see a mod and it’s not the one you want, don’t pick anything else up and leave and rejoin
---
Is the sacrificial blade ingame? Where's it at, or just random drop?
---
I’ve found them there a lot
---
It increases it by one star and adds the bleed and poison effects listed with the legendary effects.
---
Your talking to a high end grinder I've grinded eso gw2 destiny 1 and 2 borderlands hard. I just have trouble cuz there is no true test of power so I feel like there is no reason to min max at this current time hopefully vault raids change that 
---
Fair enough. Ut isn't HAHAHAHAHAHA funny.
---
The only doors of mine that are locked, are my portapotties.
---
If you sit on it, I proceed to shut the door on you. I then wait for you to ask nicely to be let out.
---
If you don't ask nicely, I don't let you out.
---
That's how one of my houses were. I had an upstairs bit, that was the living room, my stairwell, and my bedroom. There was also a workshop outside. People could come by, use my shit, watch TV, and stuff. But couldn't get into my room, unless they broke In, or I left the door open. 
---
I wish people would come : (  
---
That’s surprising, I see at least one or two a day, after the codes have been solved at least. 
---

My main problem with running the nuke bunker, is that all the rewards come from the outcome of the nuke. Its about the destination for them, not the journey. I have never seen a single legendary mob inside the bunkers. Why should we be running nuke bunkers when the mobs outside in the world have the loot, not inside?
---
Xbox has a ton more people, but a lot of young people play it too, especially with the lowered game cost.

---
&gt;"The two pvp dudes took this from me -BEEPBEEPBEEP- Bignholy?"  
---
&gt;"What is 'My Workshop'?"
---
Joke aside, workshops just arn't worth the effort. There is nothing you can't get through gameplay that's slower than holding a Workshop for them \*EXCEPT\* for fusion cores, and that's luck dependent. I've never gone back to retake a workshop from a player.
---
I must have shit luck 😆 
---
I’ll give it a look tomorrow, thanks!
---
Np!
---
I asked a while back, but couldn’t find anyone with the plans. 
---
Dang :/ if you’re on x box I can get you one!
---
I am on Xbox, how much?
---
How much you want to give? Lol
---
I’m not sure what they’re worth, lol. 
---
I’ll take a look haha, maybe I’m really lucky. I’ll be on tomorrow
---
Around there was my first camp spot, then it was by... uh... some town near some settlement? Near a super mutant camp thing? Now my camp is south of that 🐊 theme park north east (I think) of grafton. 
---
Sorry if I’m bad at locations, I can’t remember location names without using the map.
---
Anyways I went from occasional scorched/super mutants/robots near flatwoods, to getting sniped by super mutants to now anglers (I wish I could tame anglers or something I wanna go around the wasteland on a fish mutant thing) and earlier a mirelurk queen (kinda) close to my camp
---
Alright cool thanks, what’s your gamer tag? 
---
FreckledWoogie 
---
Wow! Thank you very much. You must of dropped a lot of nukes. Really appreciate the time you took to type this up. I will take a while to prep for a run and then give it a go. I will let you know how it went :)
---
Honestly? Not a damned thing changed for me (in a semi-good way). A few annoying bugs are gone. Servers are just as stable for me (rare disconnects, as in once a week). The biggest weakness is lack of end game content, and that's not been improved just yet (crossing fingers for the next couple months and the roadmap).
---
Yeah Ive ran into this alot the past few days. Killed a few three stars and no legendary drop. Im on ps4.
---
I'm the same way. I don't mind if you help yourself to the work benches down stairs but my bed is My Bed!

---
i come from vault 13, i am not a fan of bethesda games and have never played through one or spent extensive time, they have never come close to being my favorite.
---
you can see most of my 76 feedback on my /u pins, but i am working on an update which answers the 4 identity pieces with some constructive criticisms after perceiving the 5th identity piece, the unfinished / lacking element of a deep multiplayer system making for layered interaction between player choices/creations and enemies, the world, and each other. my final take is that the game has a surprising level of classic gaming roots and feel, but has failed to draw from successful games that evolved the concept of multiplayer to present us with a true many layered experience of interactive creative gameplay. it's a sandbox demo.. it does not have the finishing touches that would place it beside successful games driven forward by creators and players interaction like quake team fortress or SWG.
---
Who knows how long the online version will stay up since they’re shutting down

I am playing on an Xbox 1x. my wifi is good, so i think maybe just some bad luck today. thanks for responding, folks.
---
You fail to understand the point. Use of the macro is almost the exact same way you are able to duo items. Almost the exact same. He use the macro to mess with the amount of resources what would stop him from using it for also duping  since it’s almost identical way to get dups. 
---
i think it's being used for nothing as OP referring to it as a passion project. it's just for something interesting to create, driven just by OP passion for bethesda games / fallout or both
---
I feel like when I've crafted 5 fuel it gave me 50 in the tank 🤷‍♂️
---
What do you mean?
---
The End?
---
I had a friend in ark that won a lawsuit and paid for his home and car cash so he could work part time just to pay bills. The rest of the time he would be playing video games none stop to the point that we would be playing and all the sudden you will hear snoring in the mic because he would fall sleep online and an hour later he be talking like nothing happen lol
---
5k caps? am i missing something or isnt it supposed to be like 500 caps?
---
it's still a ripoff though, isnt it? 500 caps as opposed to 5k caps?
---
Maybe you need to  read the threads as I have never stated anything saying everyone  one who is banned on mp was cheating. If you actually re read what has been posted I state I usually give the benefit of doubt but that in most cases where people claim to have been banned unfairly that 99% were banned for legit reasons. 
---
Does vaccinated work for ghouls? I took your advice as I dont see using a melee build without power armor is viable right now in a nuke zone but I seem to still get rad worms and glowing postules from ghouls regularly. Im not sure the perk is working or I am lower level than them so I get it easier when im hit.
---
As someone who hoards these but doesn't use them, I agree.  When something can't be crafted it makes the hoarding instinct more powerful.  (And 800lb stash is still too small)
---
Prima has essentially [ceased operations](https://www.engadget.com/2018/11/09/gaming-guide-creator-prima-games-is-shutting-down/).

Looks like the online guides are at least available [until this month](https://miketendo64.com/2018/11/11/prima-games-online-guides-active-until-march-2019/) but I can’t find any more recent info. 
---
&gt;. If you dont flag or cap workshops your safe from pvp, stimpaks will heal through slap dmg. Ill be glad to link you some video proof.

Unless your teammates are involved with a huge function of the game.

You’re welcome, I guess? Had no idea it was a thing lol

i have 4 characters, 221, 25, 10, &amp; 6.. 742 hours in game, i started 2nd day of beta. i do alot of farming, going on steel runs and such to make ammo. hoard junk.   
---
dont really mess around with building really though i have a couple friends who constantly rebuild their camps.   
---
will wander around alot looking at things and exploring. help people in the fo76filthycasuals that ask for help. hit watoga and farm the 8 or so legendaries, check recipes, jump servers and do it again.  
---
i have a full time job get up at 9 am , go to work, get home round 7 pm talk to wife a few, eat dinner, hit the ps4 and relax and play til 2 or 3am hit bed, rinse and repeat. days off play all day unless the wife wants me to go somewhere or do something with her. (im 47 with grandkids so no one in house but me and her).
---
A Nuke run, ignoring a power armor glitch shortcut, can take over an hour of gameplay, depending on how experienced you are and if you are solo or have help.  If you’re  going to spend that amount of time you want the payoff.  
---
White Springs is the one location where you are guaranteed a lot of glowing ghouls and there will be a number of 3*.   This results in a large amount of XP and a lot of legendary items, a few of which will be 3* and, every so often, a two-shot explosive weapon.  I picked up a TSE hunting rifle this weekend there, my first TSE drop and I’m at level 141.  
---
The other site that gets Nuked is fissure prime for the queen scortch beast fight.  
---
Beyond that, most aren’t worth it.  There aren’t enough high level enemies to make the effort worth it.  
---
Someone Nuked the Water Park area this weekend and, outside of nuked flora for crafting, it was a bit of a bust.  If you needed nuked flora, though, it was really easy to find in the desert like landscape.  
---
One of the biggest requests is to modify more locations to have glowing ghoul spawns for Nuke events similar to White Strings.   Or maybe create glowing  Super Mutants or Mole Miners....
---
In my friend's case it's because it's something to do that isn't watching TV all day, which is the other thing he also could do.
---
My Furious Hardened Handmade. My friend gifted it to me and it has too much sentimental value for me to sell it. Plus, it's a damn good gun!
---
Don't rebuild your base. Just move it to the same spot. Blue print the whole thing and you can foil griefers. You can rebuild your entire base for free.
---
What happened to the Bethesda bug thread? I want to report this.
---
This is a longshot lol, but do you still happen to have the plans?
---
I guess better that than an anti-friendly social player :)
---
It was a patch that happened semi recently.  Probably on your break. Happy hunting :)
---
 You played 250 hours and didn't seen flatwood monster and mothman?
---
That is why it is useful to leave the Whitespring Golf Club sometimes. There is many nice things in game, you just need to explore it, not just farming legendaries.
---
I'm no big fan of the TSE ( shotguns mainly compared to how "weak" a tse single action is) but it was the only weapon that could keep up with Melee if you were Pistol build since for some reason they don't get armor pen like Melee, rifles, heavy guns 
---
my next best gun is a 3 star but it's nocturnal so it's literally useless half the time and my other 3 star is jank too

I took his statement to mean machete, as a number of people like myself knew that the sacrificial blade added an extra legendary effect in Fallout 4 and have been trying to make 4 stars with them.
---
Could be they are full of crap, but as the conversation is about machetes, I imagine that is what they are referring to.  Also, at lev 135ish I haven't seen a 3 star machete either.
---
LOL

OP is specifically asking why play so much of fallout 76 in particular, and not a different game.
---
I like this idea
---
Yes, nearly limitless Imitation Seafood and Canned Coffee!
---
I think you can tame anglers. With perks. I could be mistaken. 
---
Well shit.
---
I mean, I just realized my dog ate the paper with the code anyways, lol.
---
I have that and the cookbook, they're more like coffee table books than anything. I don't think I've even read a page of the guide. Lol
---
This is a really old post haha. If you have ever served hopped enclave for days you understand the inflated price. They are very rare. Paying for convenience 
---
I’m sure they had one planned, had to scrap it though to meet the ship date.
---
Thank you for the info. I did nuke off center of fissure prime so there was a no radiation area. I've fought he previously before in that same area and never had an issue. Is this leashing thing recent? Last time I fought her was about 6 to 8 weeks ago. 
---
You’re so right, it is spooky down there, definitely isolated. I may have to move 😊
---
Molerats can get in with or without locked doors and those little buggers hate my camp no matter where I put it. 
---
Deploy the upvotes!!
---
That’s so cool! 
---
Hai Fred! 💖
---
Did you complete the Brotherhood quest line? You get a full set from that. 
---
Unless you sold it Haha
---
Until tomorrow and I find another sweaty adventure.
---
Plus the good sweaty ones rarely comeby or end up a swift one shot and done with.
---
Idk about player count, but PC runs smooth (depending on your system) and you can run some amazing QoL mods on it. 
---
Agreed, to me this is the most glaring flaw in the game.
---
I think they made it not work in Watoga though.
---
Same on PS4. Run into the occasional buggy server that doesn't spawn or maybe somebody has just been through there right before I showed up so they're not coming back right away but otherwise works like a charm.
---
I like to start White springs runs at the golf club and sometimes it'll be empty so I skip it and go do the rest of my route and loop back to it as I finish and there's usually spawns.
---
Oh and I settled on corn soup for the AP refresh.
---
^
---
You are a good boi
---
Someone just launched back to back queen nukes on the server i was on, she was killed both times with maybe 15 minutes left.
---
It's called you're a troll and everyone can see through your bullshit. 
---
Glad you enjoyed it! 
---
It’s not Empath, it’s Strange in Numbers 
---
Can't live without it
---
well unless ya run into a maxxed out player who comes an levels your camp and you realize your guns do no damage to him. i ran into a lvl 455 and i was around 210, all my gears 3 star but i lean towards survivability and reduced weight (like revive stem, auto stim, so on) which is good for pve but not so much for pvp.  
---
where other players have built for pvp i really cant compete against them. although not a bad thing since i dont pvp any really. but, that being said im still on the hunt for armor that i could use on/for a pvp build.
---
I'm actually inside Seneca Rock. Only way to my camp is to fast travel inside the mountain. I laid my camp down up on top too, just the CAMP device thing, then traveled to my friends camp, then back and I was INSIDE the mountain. I then moved the Camp platform thing inside, and started building. Nothing can attack it. Players cannot attack it either. It's completely safe. It has water, power, food, multiple levels... hell it even has artillery. It's perfect for striking and retreating to complete safety. Centrally located is a bonus. No pets tho... they just hang out at the bottom of the mountain on the outside. 
---
Thanks, your comment made me feel young again hahahaahaaha.
---
That is awesome! I load inside of the cliff where I'm at now sometimes, but outside of my buildzone. 
---
I see it at various vendors, it's a mod, not a plan
---
Side note, I would love to know who is hunting you and possibly aid you in your fight 😁 (don’t worry I am not a spy.. hehehe)
---
I'm in now....
---
Nice
---
SBQ was easy enough after patch 5, too weak if anything. We had a 2-minute kill with 1-star weapons, although the average was more like 5min. At least if you showed up a bit late she wasn't dead already, like when TSEs were rampant.
---
It sounds like they buffed her a lot in patch 6, although I've been playing an alt lately so I have no personal experience. The event always had a lack of transparency, so it's hard to say exactly what changes.
---
This is freaking amazing! Absolutely outstanding. :D
---
Throw down your camp device in there! Or of you're on xbox come take a tour 😎
---
Holey Moleys Shop sells them for 200, any chance you can match them? 
---
*if
---
Humbly, you ain't seen nothing yet. Our 2nd one was a marvel worthy of your notice. :)

---
See I'd worry more about that if the PVP was more enticing lol nothing has a end game draw so just playing I feel fine with what I have I do hope these vault raids and pvp modes change that a bit 
---
Not true. I have a level 72 and a 42, never seen anything other then a 1 Star drop. RNG is a bitch.
---
Just south of the water park is awesome for flux. Last time I dropped up there I walked away with 154 raw Violet and an enormous amount of Cobalt and Yellowcake. 
---
This has since been patched out. Continue to look for more ways, my friends.
---
My main ask is for the paper bag to be more obvious, why it can’t be VaultTec blue with a yellow bow? It’d be easier for newbies to see when we’re trying to gift and show up better in nuke zones and long grass after death.  
---
And the irony is, they didn't go far ENOUGH for the hardcore rust fanboys, so many of them haven't even looked this way, or if they did, they went "this isn't what I want" and left. We've got a few sociopaths who genuinely just stuck around to piss in peoples cornflakes and fallout fans left. 
---
Do you know which events? 
---
There are dozens of us. Dozens! 
---
Some days you have amazing days. I was able to play glitch free for 6hrs with friends and new friends and the next day barely an hour. I love it despite that. I’m on the Xbox as well. It’s been glitchy as of late but I’ve noticed that if I wait until the atom shop loads on my main screen I’ll get dropped onto a solid server. Not fool proof but eh its something. Don’t give up!
---
Nope, sorry.
---
All the PA arms mods pertain to unarmed combat, does not even apply to 1H or 2H.
---
Or even when people on Reddit claim something.
---
That's literally what OP said. 3 star from SBQ + Sacrificial Blade = 4 star.
---
I'm not sure, leashing as a mechanic is very old but what with all the server lag and bugs it's possible you've been pulling her further than intended until now.
---
I've never fought her there just on the Prime Site
---
TSE was just an easy way for anyone to get great damage with little investment thanks to the dupers. 
---
I'm running a bloodied build and I see damage numbers that would completely shame my old TSE stuff from before the nerf and I have damage avoidance I couldn't have dreamed of having then. 
---
The difference is costs. The bloodied build requires a lot of trade offs that most players don't want to make. The reason TSEs were so heavily duped was because they were convenient, they were just OP versions of their regular guns that even unmodified and without perks were superior to many of the other possibilities.  
---
I’m just hoping it gets people like the opponent op was talking about to go in those servers and less chance for me to encounter them. 
---
Uhhh that’s where my camp is
---
**oh no**
---
I've actually had this happen a lot, I thought it was just me lol.
---
There were a couple times I creeped to a corpse to loot and an untouched ghoul is just taking a little nappy, sometimes amongst the corpses of his recently killed friends. Deep sleepers those ones.
---
I have for sure encountered an area and/or rooms where the whole spawn is playing dead at least 15+ times.
---
I don't want to ruin a good thing for myself by reporting it 🤫
---
Interesting
---
Also wondering if unlike reg armor having two mod spot pa only has one mod spot not counting helmet headlights
---
One that I’ve wanted in Fallout ever since I first heard it is [2525 by Zager &amp; Evans](https://youtu.be/3DXQWwT-WTY) 
---
Too bad, I need that violet.  
---
Right at the end of the slide on the map is usually my drop point. 
---
PS4?
---
I’m just south of there
---
Like barely south 
---
&gt; a lot of trade offs that most players don't want to make
---
lol there's no trade offs bloodied builds are tankier than my high charisma/end build because they don't have mutations that help their team. 
---
You should also know that the old TSE insanity is heavily nerfed. TS is just 25% damage and E Is jut 20%, and Demo Expert was dropped from 100% to 60%, so a TSE with Demo Expert went from 600% damage to 189% damage. 
---
One that I’ve wanted in Fallout ever since I first heard it is [2525 by Zager &amp; Evans](https://youtu.be/l3yDLvp9le0) 
---
Seriously, not sure why they don't show the raw numbers. Maybe they are not nice low integers.
---
Btw, does anyone know if the problem still exists where you have to scrap and rebuild structures that you built at a lower level so they take up less budget (because the budget taken up by placed structures doesn't scale with level)?
---
Still Having tons of fun here, servers are more stable and so are the glitches. You get hiccups but not nearly as horrible as they used to be. I’m prepping up for the next rollout. 
---
I've been saved a few times, it's truly awesome when that happens
---
I see it from the watoga train station vendor often.  I have 3 sacrificial machetes, all mods bought from that vendor.
---
you can just post for a price check in the trading subs and not trade, people do it literally all the time
---
It's some brotherhood community lol. A dude in power armor was role playing with his buddy that they were with the brotherhood and they said that i needed to give them the munition factory or they shall use force...
---
I refused and they had to use force and ended up getting continuously killed. I racked up over a thousand caps. One of them walks away but the other was butt hurt and he told me he put me on their bounty list and he will send me the video of me and my camp being destroyed by his group.
---
I chuckled at the thought at first. The next day i have 6 friend requests from random players. I randomly accepted one of them and invited to party. No response, a moment later. He is in my server. Next thing you know it him and two others  were at my base.
---
I jump on a tree ( I used to live in the mires) go chameleon and observe. I get a message from the butt hurt kid saying... ur Fucked now and I was completly aware that they wanted to blow up my camp, just as i thought. The first one to shoot used a fatman. He went wanted and down he went in one shot. His team mates became red and they soon followed. Seeing as I had the best of them. I screen shotted it and sent it to the butt hurt kid. I wrote, im so F'ed up right now. I server hop and unfriend the dude who brought them. 
---
I had another visit by them, but this time was by chance. However, a chill guy on their side who fell out with them warned me before they could make a move. We did a few trades and became friends. We set them up as he was to bait them. I built a wooden camp and filled it with corn and signs so they could rack up a big fat bounty. Once they demloished the decoy camp, me and my new ally rekt them. Took home a shit load of caps and made a new friend in the wasteland.
---
I think they got fed up of trying, but you could never be too sure.
---
The tall tool box is called just "tool chest" in its plan. The "large toolbox" is the smaller one (right?) That is roughly the same thing as the top portion of the taller one.
---
I got mine from the most southern Savage divide vendor.
---
I've started collecting teddy bears and bobbleheads for the sole purpose of displaying them with the next patch.  I sure hope it doesn't use up camp budget!  I already have used 20lbs of stash space.
---
Yeah I get that, but I’ve posted and asked what the values of many different items were and was told nothing. So I never knew if I was getting a fair deal. With a designated thread, it would be a lot easier and you wouldn’t go unheard.
---
Actually yeah it made a big difference for two reasons. Besides knocking 40% off damage making you stand in the fire much longer, far fewer players hang out in the rift area anymore so there's little help meaning not only are you getting bombarded by 1-2 SBs, you're dealing with waves of their scorched spawns alone. Used to be there was always 1-2 other players there with you. 
---
BTW yes I am on PC. i7 1080ti and it still runs meh. Yay for B's archaic engine. 
---
No trade offs?  That's a rather significant oversimplification.  My character does a ton of damage and can take some serious hits but you're lying to yourself and everyone else trying to claim there are no trade-offs running that build. 
---
- You are heavily influenced by rads as you have only 20% health to play with.  If you are taking rads you have a delicate dance to stay where you need to be (below 20% but with enough health to take a hit).  Go above 20%, Nerd Rage and Emergency Protocols are no longer active, meaning a significant loss to your tankiness. 
---
- Rad-X is off the table. Take it and a large part of your damage goes away as it suppresses Adrenal Reaction.  Even more so if melee as you lose Twisted Muscles as well. 
---
- Running in regular armor is much more hazardous as you don't have the 50% damage reduction effect of Emergency Protocols, the trade off here is you can run Unyielding if melee, or Bolstering to increase your DR. 
---
- In PA Emergency Protocols is pretty much a must-have, meaning no jet pack or stealthboy. 
---
- Your damage output, strength, and DR are heavily dependent on your health and rad level. Lose too many rads and Radicool stops giving the max +5 Str. Heal too much and your damage suffers. Go above 30% and you lose Serendipity. 
---
- Dodgy is almost a requirement. Get used to having 0 AP when shot at with high ROF weapons. 
---
sheiks and shield? Huuuuh? 
---
Also that seems really low. I think I'm pushing 1k with my All-Rise, and that's just an off-spec for me.
---
I've already got a sweet build, but maybe I'll try it one of these days. And nope, PC. You should post a video, though. If you do tag me I'd love to see it. 
---
I'm a lone player as well.  I've launched a nuke once and it was a PITA.  I personally couldn't care less about doing it now, as it's such a pain and has so little benefit.  I'll just keep letting others do it.
---
What a great read. That was good on you for helping them out. This game really brings that out in people.
---
Hey friend, did you wind up doing any tests at different levels? I'm curious how to see if theres a difference in percentage
---
Correct. Nobody can "surprise" you with housing items like OP is claiming.
---
Ditto on Pc ☹️
---
You mean Always Bugged?
---
İ felt bad for you bro
---
Depends on your base and its location. My base uses floating foundations to have a cliffside retreat that can only be attacked from one side. There isn't a chance in hell that I'll ever be able to place it again outside of another hour of work laying it out.
---
I know most of that's on me but some bases inadvertently use an overlap or something similar and can't be replaced, even if blueprinted.
---
What a lurking grump.
---
No, it didn't show as a known plan.
---
Why didn't you run to the stash box mere feet away and stash as much as you could before he came back?
---
Bad breakup?
---
I can only assume you have never been to a nuked white springs or done an event like uranium fever? Yeah rng is a bitch but come on I have dropped/sold probably over a hundred 3 star legendaries and I only have one level 102 character.
---
I don't think you understand profrssions. 
---
90% reduced chance of disease with environmental card.
---
nope, not at all. its ground corn basically. you cook it up personally i like it as a curry thing but that's not typical use it's normally a side that soaks up grease well.
---
Ok im online now.  Had to watch the Walking Dead
---
The other vendors aren’t in the production wing... gotta have higher level access
---
Well if you want a TSE guass I'll sell you mine, will get you  pretty close to your original damage. 
---
hmm, what do you mean?
---
I always leave my door unlocked and open.  I'm perfectly fine with people walking in and using it.  Help yourself.  I wish I could make a vending machine!  5c for a purified water, more for things like nuka stuff.  You have to keep it stocked.
---
I've only ever once gotten a notification that my camp was being attacked.  I quickly server jumped.  When I got back to base they had destroyed one wall.  It's also in the forest area so mainly lower level players there anyways. 
---
I can only imagine what was going through his head as he realized what you were doing with the Scorchbeast. Like “I’ve got him cornered, now to wait till he-wtf is he shooting at?” *hears wings flapping* “aw shit”
---
In FO4, PA had three categories. The first was armor type. Upgrading this increased the health and DRs. Second category was a mod. Third was paint. 
---
Now, we don't get the option of making multiple levels of power armor items, only the base item. For example, all T-51 is the b series. This leaves just the mod and paint job. 
---
legendary deathclaws are worse. they are super fast as well so always a fun time trying to catch them.
---
Last night we successfully took down the SBQ, within about 5 minutes. It was glorious.
---
And the paint job is purely cosmetic? 
---
The scorch beast, the king of ruining the moment. Always a good tool in tight situations. Lol
---
OH HELL YEAH BROTHER! *starts downing bottle after bottle of nuka cola dark* LETS GET THIS SHIT GOING
---
Never had it here. Don't recall anywhere I've been in the state that's served it either.  Tons of other staple foods, but never grits. 
---
&gt;Just because the game looks interesting doesn't mean you should 100% get it.  Look at No Man's Sky.  It looked interesting, but on launch it was a completely empty, bug-riddled mess of a game that cheated people out of what they were promised with it.  It was the next Fable 3.  
---
&gt;If you want a Fallout game where you can engage with people and the world, 76 is NOT the game for you.  If you want to simply roam around and shoot things, build things, and enjoy your setting, 76 IS for you.  Don't sugar coat games because you like it.
---
dude the game was trash and everyone knows it. i literally know absolutely zero people who played past the first few days. me and my friends were playing and the only fun part was laughing hysterically at just how awful that massive piece of shit was.
---
I study astrophysics, so I might be able to help out with that part.
---
What platform?  
---
If PS4 I'll be on in the morning.  
---
Smoking some ganja
---
I have the perk card, but even if it wasn't equipped it would show up as having had it, but not being able to use it due that perk card. I think the card shows as being locked?  
---
And the Ranger's aim was deadly with the Big Iron on his hip.
---
3x?  Amateur. 
---
Seriously though, a good one can really crank out the damage.  It gets absolutely insane once you run below 10%, which I often do for PvE. 
---
I paid full price for an unfinished product, and am unable to get a refund because of Bethesda's bullshit refund policy, which is basically: "We don't do refunds". Of course I'm gonna be a grump. Fuck FO76 and fuck Bethesda. I hope they go bankrupt.
---
Yep. Totally screws my damage up anytime someone shares it. 
---
I built my favorite manor down the hill from there and it was a flat area with an aluminum deposit, next to a cabin with some copper nodes. Really secure and never had enemy issues other than the occasional mole rats.
---
&gt;That's a rather significant oversimplification.
---
Sure that's fair.
---
. Go above 
---
&gt;20%, Nerd Rage and Emergency Protocols are no longer active, meaning a significant loss to your tankiness.
---
we both know this isn't hard to actually manage, it's laughably easy. 
---
&gt;Rad-X is off the table.
---
Okay?
---
it's not a hardship when it's the same drawback every single mutant build has lmao
---
Oh no you have to use Radshield what a huge drawback it's only one of the best items in the game.
---
&gt;Dodgy is almost a requirement
---
You're joking right.
---
wow you have to use perks that stop you from dying when that's the one intended handicap of the build.
---
&gt;This doesn't even touch on the cost issue of getting sentinel pieces or trying to get a set of bolstering/unyielding or the costs of bloodied weapons. We enjoy great strength because we were able to get all the perks we needed and buy the significantly more expensive gear (compared to the market with TSE).
---
Good thing dupers made them worthless and everyone competent has them
---
&gt;(compared to the market with TSE)
---
Lol you're really just uninformed TSE cost more than sentinel/bolstering/unyielding/bloody for a significant amount of game time
---
Reminds me a lot of what I hope to do when I pick up 76. I wanna make a nice little settlement, probably around the start or most populated area, that offers safety and supplies to people who need it.
---
Great story! Quick question: 
---
You mentioned in there that you wanted to take Berry Mentats to find the hidden sniper, but didn't because it would give away your position. Out of curiosity, how would it have done that? Is there something I don't know about those?
---
I just play in passive mode
---
Why is all the cool shit on Xbox
---
Maybe didnt have space ?
---
Yeah that one big lake in the northeastern part of the map far from every literal notable area other than harpers ferry with the only mass of water that seems to never be inhabited. Seems legit.
---
Wooooow, what a story. Thanks for the share :)
---
When you use it, the smoke applies to everything invisible, including yourself. If i am wrong, please correct me.
---
I just set up this shortcut. What a cool find. 😎 
---
My experience is that many old gamers quit. These two weeks I found half of players are &lt; lv50. So nuking for SBQ is meaningless now. Instead I nuke whitespring daily to make new comers happy. 
---
Until they make all Scorch beasts legendary and the queen 3* drops only it's not worth killing them. 
---
The nerfs are too severe now and they haven't rebalanced anything in light of that. 
---
Bethesda , flag people dumping mass high level legendaries (of the same variety) with this system and investigate these accounts to see which are hardcore players or dupers stressing the server. It's not entrapment if they're willing! 
---
Still could have fast traveled away if he did so quick enough that the guy hadn't made it within range yet. 
---
If he's still flagged as hostile the other guy wouldn't have been able to know where he went as his map marker wouldn't reappear until PvP timed out. 
---
East of white springs there’s the mountains and they typically have flatted areas around the behemoth and even north of that around black water mine in the hills, flat and expansive with an underestimated view.
---

I wish I knew how to associate it with my Reddit.
---
1969. That's an issue. Well past the cultural period Fallout is based on.  
---
What's more, WV should be behind the times culturally, as this has always been the case.  Major cultural changes simply don't take root here immediately.  
---
I'm lvl 141 and JUST now saw this today while doing a surface to air mission in the bog.  Never even knew it was a thing. 
---
Are you sure you're missing the items? When I log in I'm over encumbered and can watch my weight go down as my perk cards start to take effect.
---
You've influenced me so much im gonna buy some ATOMs now. 
---
I saw Grafton Dam / Steel get nuked the other day, usually its Fissure Prime or WhiteSpring.
---
Not sure why you'd nuke Grafton or the Crashed Station though 🤔
---
Funnily enough it crashed on Graftons nuke too..
---
Inclusion of Marty Robbins pieces would have been nice, particularly the western ones. While it may seem like an odd fit, music of this genre was popular here.  Country music (if modern country can be called such) still reigns supreme on WV air waves, making up the bulk of the music stations.
---
Hank Williams would have also been a good fit. His stuff is still popular among some, even today. 
---
Don't know if you're still looking.  If you're on xbox my GT is claycalebrissy . I'll be glad to put one on for you when I'm online.

Maybe we should send some on to check in on them though. Remind them that the rest of the world still exists.

Surviving = not dying; thriving = Winning. 👍😂

I agree with the comment that no one seems to know how to close a door, so I always put locks on my doors... my shutters, too. Molerats knawing on the inside walls sux.

But outside on the back deck is a Tinker's bench and a Stash for public use. I also keep my water purifier unlocked.. Take what you need!  Just don't leave my doors open, lol!

Hi, Added you as friend. I would love to get the plan to the marine armor helmet. Thanks!
---
Just have fun, many here in the fallout Community look out for each other and sometimes team up! There was a post earlier on what to expect, it’s all true. Bugs, glitches, inability to put down the game. And Depends on your system, many of us look for people to play with once we get a feel for you either on here or on Instagram. Another great fallout Community area. I’m a level 34 but hang out for fun with high level peeps who just goof off farm ghouls for xp and it’s crazy fun. More so when a glitch happens and we’re busting a gut. Welcome to the community! 
---
Ouch ☹️
---
I've considered moving mine around there at a future level.  Though I'd need to build a bunker for near there I think!!
---
My drops in whitesprings we're excellent tonight.  I teleported in right on the tail end of a nuke zone and every legendary enemy dropped a legendary item. Then in Watoga twice tonight a scorchbeast attacked the city and the robots all we're shoting at it, first time I've even seen that and it happened twice, and I helped kill the scorchbeast and it dropped a prime receiver plan.  So maybe it's like in Vegas, sometimes your machine is hot and sometimes not.
---
I will point out that John Denver’s original Country Roads, Take Me home was released in 1971. 
---
As for WV being behind the times, I would have to disagree. For instance, one of the major themes of the game is the large-scale automation of nearly every pre-war industry before the bombs fell. This theme of automation and over-reliance on technology also plays a major part in 2525.
---
effing epic read!! whish we had the video to go with it.
---
I've changed mine slightly as I've played the game and keep on tweaking it. Here is currently what I'm working with, a 2H and fist build which is heavily based on the builds listed in the thread.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3558c8&amp;d=s40sm0sn0ss2sg2se2sb1l71lu2a72au2a12a00id2ir1ih2c72cu0ei0eu0pe2sf0e52s71lt2&amp;w=s92a42i42c50cr0pa0p80p90ij2i30if2i50ie2ia0lm2ik0l52&amp;n=wasteman2k's
---
I tend to swap between fist weapons a fair bit. And some of the perks that are swapable are just for QOL.
---
Yeah, with building system in its current state there's no guarantee you'll ever be able to place your base once it's picked up... Kinda pisses me off every time I see that unfinished corner of my base where I can't place any walls because of camp borders. I don't want to even start to think about rebuilding my shalet with all those decorations, lighting and stuff... Would be great if they'd allow to move the c.a.m.p module to move the borders with it without blueprinting all the structures.
---
OK BUDDY
---
Yeah I’m level 29 and just 1 day logged off. I have about 30 hours played ... idk just can’t get in to it. But deep down I want too.. I just get bored but can’t really explain why 
---
As a seasoned gamer, I am of the camp that gaming is just as viable a hobby as reading or drawing. That said, 800 hours in a game like this goes beyond the realm of "hobby" and straight into "addiction" territory. 
---
Multiple books have different stories, tales, and experiences. Reading books is also wildly beneficial for the brain, increasing elasticity and keeping things healthy. Listening to, er, symphonies is a passive activity. You can listen to that while doing anything else. 
---
Gaming for eight+ hours a day is straight up unhealthy. There's no plot to sink into, nothing to help your brain grow, and your ass being planted in a chair isn't helping your body at all. 
---
I'm glad others are using the ice box at the golf clubhouse more and more! I've been doing that since early December. I doubt I was the first, but I'm pretty sure I've been the most consistent filler. Unless I get a very solid 3*, in it goes, I just dont have the room! 😂😂
---
Have fun I guess. People like you are why they put that greedy shit in the game anyway, and why they'll continue to make half assed games and charge full price for it. Bethesda is just as bad as Activision and EA at this point.
---
head. shots. 
---
PC. It has mods =3
---
(Nothing major though. Simple QoL stuff with the UI and some reskins. Loving the Higher Rez Map Mods)
---
Swapping perks every time I go to CAMP doesn't sound remotely fun
---
Additionally, in the year 2077, the song 2525 had been in existence for 108 years. I don’t think WV was more than 108 years behind the rest of the country culturally. I know you were speaking about the culture lagging behind, but I also would say WV was clearly not behind the times technology. One of the major themes of the game is the large-scale automation of nearly every pre-war industry before the bombs fell. This theme of automation and over-reliance on technology also plays a major part in 2525.
---
Hmmm, I may look you up in game for a solo run if you're willing? I don't really know anyone else playing except my wife and she's literally 100 levels behind me as she just like to build her camp.  I've got several cards but I've not been able to do it solo yet. 
---
IGN = The_zimmers 
---
I never stated that it was. I offered a solution, not commentary on the quality of it.
---
That's a good point.  The "you're over encumbered" message always pops up after logging in and fast travel until it applies the perk cars.  There is a bit of delay/lag sometimes.
---
A friend of mine is in the process of teaching me how to stream and edit my videos. I will try to stream, but he tells me a fo76 stream would be boring, because while these moments do occur, there are more grindy bits that would probably make viewers bored. So I am also considering just to make videos and edit them to fit in with my narratives.
---
Hopefully, I will be able to provide videos, but that wouldn't stop me from writing down the stories. I find pleasure in writing about my sweaty moments.
---
I would love to see a Marty Robbins song or two make a return to the Fallout franchise
---
The culture of the entire Fallout series has been the Post-War, 50's culture.  Songs from the Vietnam era are of an entirely different culture and have no place in the series as that cultural revolution never happened. 
---
Fallout did not follow our timeline. Vietnam and the Cold War never happened, so the cultural revolution that accompanied that dark period of American history never occurred either. 
---
I tried too - didn't work. Someone said they found a dead vault dweller with 96 on their back.
---
Well, I don't run a melee build, so I just get Nerd Rage 20%, Bloodied.. what is it, 75%? And Adrenal is all over the place, and yeah, with the last patch, from 20% health to 10% health is like a 20% damage bump for a total of like 80% bonus. 
---
I’m in the little river canyon in Toxic Valley that connects Grafton to the lake at Grafton dam. Nothing really comes in there and the river seems to confuse enemies 
---
You're always getting ripped off.  There... happy....   You can always find someone who bought something lower than you did...  (grin)
---
I accepted. Sure, I can help!
---
At 10% my shotgun does 1100. Buzz blade at 400-600. 
---
Dewd, it isn't worth it to seek revenge or even to respawn in a situation like that, just block them and server hop to get another shop with no griefers
---
My doors and many water purifiers are never locked. :) 
---
It's in a safe spot where Enemies are blocked by tiny concrete fences anyways. Closest my house has been to having a monster in it was the guy with the silly voice wearing a Faschnacht Mask.
---
Molerat attacks.
---
I think that'd be pretty fun, but I'm not sure how it would work. How would they authorize the music? Maybe have like, a list of music you can use? Neat idea for sure. 
---
The chumbucket6
---
Yes! Essentially start your yield at the start of your play through and see how many customers you get, items that sell out quickly can be priced higher and items that don't sell at all encourage variety and diversity of items.
---
Good work man, thanks! 
---
From 2525’s Wikipedia entry:
---
&gt;The overriding theme, of a world doomed by its passive acquiescence to and overdependence on its own overdone technologies, struck a resonant chord in millions of people around the world in the late 1960s.
---
I makes sense to me that, in the same year of man first landing on the moon in the Fallout universe, some people were becoming apprehensive of fast-improving technology just as they did in reality.
---
Very nice!
---
This weekend I was at two Nuke events at White Springs \[PS4\].  A lot of 1\* drops. some 2\*, and a few 3\*.   I got a 2\* TSE hunting rifle...  my very first TSE drop at level 141...  I have noticed that the armor drops have been a bit sucky, but I attribute that to just random chance.
---
Nuke events lasts 2 hours real time.  I've been sticking around to the very end lately.  Most people leave after the first hour or so.  I do notice that drops seem to be better near the end of a Nuke event.  Sometimes I see double spawns.  In other words, I'll clear an area, the radiation will disappear, and then glowing ones will re-spawn immediately one last time, usually with better drops.  
---
But maybe it's just that by playing the RNG slot machine more often (i.e. killing more glowing ones), you get more drops, which translates into more chances to win the legendary lottery...
---
Twice I got deep into launching solo just to be disconnected. Such fun. Ytwice I've fought the SBQ and had her stuck in 90% health. The first time we tried to stick it out, there were only some of us, the second when there was almost a full server we literally just started ignoring her and getting the loot off the hordes with her. Nuke directly over prime, solidly in the Rad zone.
---
I used up all my AA 50 Cal ammo and my TSE, while still good, wasn't doing anything to her. I haven't even bothered logging on to replenish my ammo. 
---
What serums do you have? Looking for marsupial, eagle eye, adrenal and/or speed demon
---
Doesn't endurance have an effect on how much ap you use when sprinting. 
---
This is kind of my thought. Which is why hitting something other then prime. Like Whitesprings is better. Its a better reward. Those bunkers suck, they are tedious and not much fun. Hitting prime really isnt worth the time and effort. 
---
In Fallout 4, yes. 
---
In Fallout 76, no. 
---
I think I saw one yesterday at the vendor at the train station near the Top of the World (can't remember it's name).
---
Doesn't the computer give last known whereabouts?
---
Are you 100 percent sure of that 
---
Pretty sure it drops from the scorch beast queen at a very small chance so pretty late game I would imagine 
---
Interesting take
---
I use the Flamer as a primary weapon! But I also....
---
1) Am using glitched fuel from traps from long ago just in order to sustain this damn thing. It's ridiculous!
---
2) Somehow glitched it so that I have a broken flamer equipped and no longer need to worry about durability!
---
Just follow these two easy and game breaking steps in order to have any sort of fun with this weapon class! (Seriously. These glitches are basically required because of the awful durability and ammo consumption. I wanted to make a fire breather roleplayer with the healing flame ability and was so incredibly disappointed when I finally got my hands on one.)
---
Had same thing happen but in my case a player stood over my bag and I could not get it.
---
Is that the only way to obtain the plans?
---
I have seen plenty on PC. Just ran across a camp right against the whitesprings train station between it and Blackwater, 4 stories, Said "Fuk You" in the window. Like 60 stash boxes all stacked up all around with what I could count through the window was no less than 40 sirens all blaring. I laughed at this one for a good 20 mins. Somone was angry. 
---
Yeah I've had them attack Watoga ever since launch. Not all the time but not exactly unheard of either. Lately WS, when I've bothered to play 76, has been poor for loot.
---
He was jerk.  He knew it belonged to someone else.  
---
If someone is doing the Mayor for a Day quest the final mission has you fighting a rooftop full of robots while being annoyed by a scorchbeast so that can happen. But there's also several scorchbeast spawn points near town like by the train station or the BoS camps near the fissures and sometimes that agitates the Watoga bots and occasionally that'll tease the scorchbeast over to town. It doesn't happen that often but about every other day you can see one in town. Maybe more frequently if you server hop a bunch.
---
IM ON PS4 WHY THIS IS BULLSHIT
---
You can buy them on the market/bazaar between 500-2000 caps
---
Perfect place for a griefer to level several camps.  Seems like a top notch idea....
---
Partially. 
---
I started out as a 15AGI 15END build (back in December). I tried jacking up my END to around 25, hoping sprinting goes free at 21END. 
---
No cookie. 
---
My timings back then were not as methodical as they were now, but I was still sprinting between 20 and 55 seconds. 
---
I now have 1END (I’m a dual stack 15STR/15PER gun build), and haven’t tested the effects of END on sprint duration. Perhaps worth a jab. I have some END raisers in my stash, should be able to add 4-5 points and compare. I’ll report back. 
---
Apologies, but is that a vendor location? I would gladly pay 2000 caps.
---
We are in violent agreement in everything but one thing, I found your description of FO76 as "snack sized" as laughable.  The 210 hours is actually how much time I have in FO76 as of last night, which is, as you point out way more than most games promise. 
---
Nope.
---
I have a different issue I have been trying to figure out. I feel like my armor is paper after the past 2 patches. Even in my power armor. I am level 125 by a buddy I am with is like level 35. I am watching him toe to toe with Level 68 Glowing Yao Guai and the thing is one or two shotting me. He's juggling 2 at the same time. 
---
Nukes are still being dropped. Most of the time I fight the queen the server is filled with peopel from my fl or my friends fl. If there are too many low lvl people on the server and almost no friends I don't nuke.
---
Nothing is more annoying than a few players around lvl50 just sitting on top of the building just outside of rad zone farming mobs for 20 minutes. I don't know what the issue is but I see quite a few players (new I guess) drop a nuke solo around lv 50 or before. With the most weirdest placement and ofc no one is going to show up for that. I always think the guy just googled the quests before actually playing the game..... Suc ha waste especially when codes aren't fully out yet.
---
This isn’t January 
---
When you saw him picking locks, the proper thing was...
---
immediately open map, block anyone near your camp, the other 3 probably showed up -- Perma block, not session.
---
Then log off and log back on.  Problem solved.
---
What was good about canned coffee again? I remember reading something about it but I don't remember.
---
I like to have somewhere to change up my perk cards without having someone/something creeping up on me. Every time I open my cards I seem to spawn a feral ghoul zombie party. 
---
All my benches, purifiers and food are outside and free for the taking. 
---
I was thinking of talk shows but music would be awesome as well, I'm tired of the same old songs. It would be very hard to monitor the type of music I imagine, but maybe! 
---
Ran into this a couple of times on PC tonight. I figure like the others, someone must have just come through right before I got there. 
---
I have all those 
---
I dunno why you said that to me when all i talked about was TS but i'll bite. 
---
Fireproof only reduces the explosive legendary effect and explosives of course. So the 24% damage boost is now an 11% damage increase. Hardly a reduction to damage here. 
---
Anti-Armor is really the only thing Power Armor users should be scared about. 
---
Most min/max melee usually aims around 800 damage. Lets assume the melee has 100% Armor Penetration just for name sake. Blocker reduces that to 420, then emergency protocols reduces that to 210. So unless your rocketing more then 210-hp while under 20%-hp then i see no issue why Melee is killing you. 
---
How much are you asking for it? 
---
Are we twins?
---
[https://i.imgur.com/ay6BNCh.png](https://i.imgur.com/ay6BNCh.png) 
---
Lol why didn't he just server hop?
---
WHAT?!?! My mother was a saint! Get out!
---
legendary enemies do spawn there. I've seen 1 to 3 star ones with good xp lvl as well meaning the drops were on level. There are also quite a few materials en mag/bobblehead you can snag on the way. Silo run solo is max just under 30 minutes but can be done around 20 or less if you are racing.
---
I feel it's ok even though a highly secured bunker would be filled with dangerous killer robots if you think about it.
---
Endurance specifically states that it reduces sprint cost when you hover over the stat in your pipboy. 
---
I was trying to avoid logging off and resetting up my workshop cycle if I could, and the in game block option is only for that session, and even if you block someone on PSN they can still see you. Haven't had any more issues though so.
---
Empath mutation?
---
Good to know. Definitely worth a check then. 
---
Thank you. 
---
I was just reading about that. Thinking the same. 
---
Adrenal Reaction and Strange in Numbers is also broken, it can give you a massive negative on weapon damage if you’re in group but far away from your teammate
---
Got my plans as a random drop from SBQ as the other guy said. I really regret clicking on them as I  could have sold them for like 2k. I don’t have the arches installed nor do I plan to do reading them was a complete waste. :-(
---
Oh, I gotcha. 
---
Good for some fresh draft once in a while
---
Yep, it’s often to do with Mayor For A Day, 
---
I’ve had lots of SB kills here. Head to the roof of the medical center and you you can pick them off , afterwards go and pick off the crawling bots for extra leveling 
---
I was hoping 3k
---
&gt;100% Upvoted  
---
&gt;C
---
I think they're saying the Reddit market.
---
Well played.
---
If you come in staggered and your friends keep dying while you rush through. Then yes the game will spawn the enemies that it did for you already. Either go alone or stick together. Maybe your buddy or you should lay of the looting for a bit while in there. I see people get distracted and lost by the silliest stuff down there.
---
I like your suggestions . I wish pet taming actually  functioned tho.
---
You were out picking mushrooms and you saw an alien. And, later, the animals started following you. Yes of course...
---
Even w/o PA it's doable if you just focus on objectives asap.
---
Yup. Took me a few hundred hours to figure this out as well
---
If you don't care about looks, you can stack foundations to make walls and a roof now. Foundations are indestructable. Make it, say, 5 X 5, three levels high, and note that you'll have to remove a foundation to enter and leave, but you can build everything inside and be utterly immune to everything.   
---
But if you care about looks? We need some kind of Pacifist Camp setting for sure.
---
I see.   I don't do Workshops for this specific reason.  Waste of resources with all the griefers and disconnects.   You lose more than you gain.  
---
On PC, there is a perma block.  In the last 2 months, there has been dramatic increase in griefers.  I would recommend not doing the workshops at all.  Unless you absolutely ensure you spend no resources on the workshops.  Then if you need to log off and back, you just lose the shops and no risk to you.  Just go claim others if want.
---
Are you okay? This post was 33 days ago 
---
H. weapons down there? Why? Honestly a waste of materials and pretty ineffective considering the endless spawning of mobs and your comparatively easy goal that you can rush while ignoring most of the enemies even w/o sneak. Even if you aren't a melee user I would suggest using melee there. You burn so much resources otherwise  while actually needing it after the launch 
---
this made me laugh.
---
If they make prestige give all weapons +10% damage, I immagine everyone will do it.
---
Yeah, there are nests on the top of some of the buildings and now and then a few agro the bots. 
---
These. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwACcwNHsk1kFw5SEtOsKWRQ2RJBJSXxZ
---
I solved this problem by turning off the in-game radio and making my own youtube playlist. Since I am on PC I just use Discord with a music bot to play them. My friends and I all jsut listen to that while we play. 
---
There are alot of options using this method.

I've played 1,3, new Vegas, 4, and recently 76. 3 and new Vegas replayed them hundred times
---
I was going to say, its just a 4* because he added a mod right lol
---
The only time I attempted this event, I constantly repaired the eyebot which, despite having little health or offensive abilities, insisted on constantly attacking. At one point it just bugged and kept repeating the same lines while I broke all my weapons fighting seemingly unending waves of super mutants until the timer ran down and I failed the event.
---
Putting a great amount of time into a game can be a sign of a few things. But when it comes to fallout for me atm it's just the fact that fps is still in a dip (they are stuck on br for almost 10 years now even the class based shooter is going that way). Also have a group of people to play with. Next to that I believe if you want a game to be good you have to stick with it. That's why I am hanging around for 76. 
---
Next content patch and how they handle the bugs issues that will coincide with it will determine if I keep coming back. Because even though some good updates (that should have been in the base game, old fo3 issues!!) have come by the fact of it being old  &amp; broken at it's core paired with  how AAA studios try to keep you on the line have me worried.
---
I have killed a lot of mobs that weren't Legendary at all but has legendaries on them as loot. RNG. 
---
Not if you put the pressure plates on the inside. That way, people can come in by opening the door manually, do their business and as they leave, step on the pressure plate. As soon as they step off and go through the door, it shuts behind them.
---
The issue with this is that it means you have to put the power connectors and cords inside, so it takes away from the aesthetics of your C.A.M.P. if that’s something that matters to you.
---
Don't really see locked up camps often. I myself leave everything locked except generator room. So if you see mine go to purifiers or big house, little shack its locked up generators lol no use in picking
---
 it
---
Yeah, especially with the guaranteed legendary areas and events. I am level 91, I have had probably 75ish 3star drops total, although maybe only 10 at level 50. All non level 50 gear, 3star or not, gets dropped on the ground
---
I ended up logging back off and on, and it served me well because it got me a plan I had been looking for when I retook a couple of the workshops
---
SBQ, every time.
---
Unruly golfer spawn are linked to players around lv 20-30. Keep an eye out for this on the map and go there when they are there. I've completed this quest more than 5 times and multiple of them were in one go within a hour.
---
Might also take note that the dupers were suspended these last two weeks also. Im not saying thats the whole reason, but it couldnt get more obvious that it has something to do with it. Its sad but we need them back. Lol. They were our ace in the hole. That and most of the low levels you see are probably the dupers with new accounts. At least on console anyways, since all they have to do is make a new account.
---
The topic of a good game design and the topic of being prepared for PvP mode - these are two separate topics. If you try to suggest me being unready to handle the challenge, I suppose you must be unready yourself if you do such a suicidal thing.
---
Lets just agree that your perspective on this topic is as irrelevant as your situational awareness. And we can have a duel if you want to give me caps.
---
Yeah I picked mine up from Thunder Mountain Power Plant. If I remember correctly, it’s in the same room as the terminal (the one used to restart the Power), and besides the giant window. 
---
Yep 👍 I found it and posted on there too. 😃
---
I have made a whole thread on this. 
---
Player A, Waypoints to location. Player B Waypoints to the same location before Player A has loaded in completely, Player B is now invisible to player A. The game only loads what is there when you load in. The same thing happens when walking through a door into an instance. 
---
We reproduced this and tested it over hours and hours of play. 
---
Its simple to avoid.
---
Player B waits until player A tells them they have loaded in and are able to move. 
---
You can avoid it 100% if you do this. Unfortunately, if you have a large group of players it takes forever. 
---
It's not perfect, but its a solution and it works 100% every time. 
---
It's just annoying to have to constantly wait to be told: "Ok I have loaded in, go ahead and waypoint." 
---
Watoga medical center roof - server hop this location.  I find 3 pieces of T-60 pretty often here and theres always a mod sitting next to the suite for it.
---
PvP is broken only when you take a PvE melee build and bring it to PvP gunfight. Oh, and also ita broken until both parties slap each other.
---
That was a great read!  I'm not that much into PvP, but I love this kind of blow-by-blow :D
---
nani?
---
Well I’m trying to hold back on the main quest for now. I was looking for an alternative means of getting them. 😃
---
Yeah, I have used the old background music in the background, but having to tab out of the game to turn it down every time you want to listen to dialogue or a holotape never ceases to annoy. If Bethesda wants to make 76 a long-term Fallout game to hold many of us over until the distant release of Fallout 5, it makes sense to add more music.
---
LB/RB on Xbox when in perk card menu 
---
That doesnt always fix it. I have been able to get in and out of power armor, When out the other player can see my empty suit but still not me. Hop back in the suit and its all back to invisible. Its quite hilarious. 
---
Awesome. What time zone are you? I’m GMT 07:48 right now. Won’t be on for around 8 hours yet
---
I got a plan for the sacrificial blade but I’m sorry it was in December maybe and I don’t remember where but it’s out there
---
I agree, but for now, I took action I am not waiting lol. The in-game broken record of 15-20 songs got boring in a day or two. I keep the musicbot volume around 7. which seems to be good depending on what song is playing. 
---
Bugs, lags, disconnects and freezes. This fucking game is so broken.
---
I’m actually in literally the same situation as the other guy. Tried to google and see if there was info on FO76 moving forward and was directed here. I just don’t understand why people defend it still. I felt tricked after I bought it.
---
I'm only lvl 26 and i still agree. Not much of a threat. Like, anywhere. Except my first deathclaw today. Just danced around a tree and shot it though.
---
Yes that happens to me to
---
The revolver and bolt action benefit from pistol and rifle perks if they have a "stock", so if they are nodded to be a rifle. I haven't been able to get the basic pipe pistol to benefit from both yet though. So they would both do more damage than their counterparts, because they have two perk sets to pull buffs from, and you can make use of the Gun Runner perk while having your sniper rifle out if you're trying to sneak-clear a place relatively quickly. I would say they are viable pretty much the whole game, and when you want to start taking out the big baddies you can carry a heavier hitting gun around because they both also benefit from the pistol weight reduction perk.
---
\+600% damage from TSE was definitely a problem.  It needed to be nerfed big time.  Now they are still OP at 189% damage.
---
They really need nerfing yet again.
---
Don't you normally do that? I do, what with crafting perks and all that razzmatazz
---
Here’s a suggestion don’t run shit that’s being abused? I’m running a melee build laughing at all y’all complaining it’s funny asf
---
Aww, well that's too bad. Fortunately I only have ideas for 5 characters. Just sucks if I end up liking my Survival mode guy I'd have to make a duplicate guy for adventure when more content is added to that. 
---
Same here havn’t found anything there yet, I dump stuff at the overseers camp, and suitcases at various train stations. But got lucky from some high level players giving me some goodies.
---
Your absolutely right the whole PvP does add a certain tension when you've spent the last twenty minutes emptying the high school of plastic and level 200 walks in,  and you know he isn't there to say hi.
---
I don't know what it is, I also love the division and avoid the dark zone for fear of being jumped and having all the gear I've looted robbed from me.
---
I know it's only junk they can take from you in FO so it ain't that much of a big deal if someone does kill you.
---
There's your problem. 
---
TY for the update!
---
I would actually recommend doing the quests early on (enemy level/difficulty permitting) something I never do in Fallout games normally.  
---
There are some plans you can only get from completing certain quests, and you’re gonna want them
---
I had this issue with my 144Hz G-Sync monitor. I used MSI Afterburner to cap the framerate to 70 and the stuttering was fixed but yes, it seems to be tied to G-Sync and it sucks that I am not playing it at higher FPS. I guess I'll try ULMB but I hate screen tearing more than dropping to 60Hz.
---
I’ve not lucky with legendary drops, so I generally run with silenced vampires Handmade and a silenced 2 shot pipe rifle.  I also have a medics lever rifle in my stash which I use for the occasional sniping party from the roof of whitesprings fire station 
---
I’ve done maybe 20-25 SBQ runs the last 3 I did all failed. My first failures ever. There’s something seriously wrong here, even with a majority of us using melee we can’t get it down passed 75%
---
I'm into moving some/many perks but I'm not sure it's what I'll be sticking with. Some sort system making respeccing more swift would be great.
---
Wow you're really salty over this huh?
---
Use Rad X diluted
---
So yet another Youtuber trying to promote his own videos... lame.
---
some mods can't be learned that's pretty much the only reason for me to use them (in endgame)
---
Hunting rifle will always lose to Gauss or a decent lever action. The .308 just isn't meant to be the best singleshot choice. I use a bloodied one and its still me in comparison. Also iir the plus limb dmg adds to cripple like in the old fallout not actual raw dmg.
---
Without any stealth perks, stealth seems to function normally for me.

I believe the bug is caused by one of the stealth perks. My guess is it's the one that puts you back into stealth when crouching as that's the one I see in common when I ask people who experience this bug what perks they are using. But it could be any since they all have a mix of stealth perks. I don't have any of these cards and no-one who has this issue seems to be willing to test it with different variables.
---
The scorchbeast is supposed to go for the player? Cause when I was doing that quest the fight happened a couple of blocks over and the scorchbeast didn't even notice me. 
---
Because Sony fans are too busy circlejerking about their console company restricting crossplay in a ton of games.
---
Go to nukacrypt.com n if code is solved already it will show for silo 
---
Glad I didn't go after them then 😂
---
Hmm, what's the lowest you would go?
---
If you are going single shot I would suggest trying the hair trigger receiver. It's a slight dmg drop compared to hardened on paper but works just aswell if not better in practice. My go to is hair trigger or any true(hipfire reduced) one if its vats related. 
---
I’m trying to wait for my wife to level up so we can do the main quest together, she’s at 29 ATM.
---
Just the code. As for tips you can hack the terminals and firstly remove targeting restrictions which turns the turrets against the robots, when all is quiet deactivate the turrets, have fun and good luck.
---
If you get the fireproof perk and a dense mod on your armor chest piece they pretty much totally negate the sonic damage. All u have to worry about is the melee and rad attack.
---
Both the comments before me are good. Gatling and mini guns do well. But so does a properly modded shotgun with some perks and the enforcer perk. Have concentrated fire and cripple a wing or two.
---
The third option is stealth. Either mod on ur power armor or get a chameleon piece of armor. Stealth for a few minutes usually in a building if there is one and they will get bored.
---
Stealth plus dense mod plus fireproof perk is good too. Just have some radaway in case 
---
People can one shot others with the hunting rifle?
---
He's busy duping ultracite 
---
Yeah, first time i got the LMG, crafted some ammo, i throw it away immediatley. Now way i can feed it long-term.
---
This game is made to be addictive.  It hits the brain the right spot and peple with addictions or some other  ogmotive issue can become addicted  and or use as a tool 
---
Awesome, it's rare to see this perspective and even rarer upvoted to the top, even on gaming subreddits.
---
I was encumbered before I logged out (500+), my max carry is about 350.  Hence why I couldn’t fast travel away in the first place after grabbing 200 lbs of this dude’s junk. 
---
All you need is a nuke keycard and the code offline no silo pieces required unless the code hasn’t been solved yet
---
&gt;Listening to, er, symphonies is a passive activity.
---
There's a difference between hearing and listening, the latter isn't passive at all.
---
That’s awesome, thank you!
---
Oh, that’s great advice, thanks!
---
No, I think you still have to go in and claim the workshop. Not tried it tho so not 100% sure.
---
Nerf to TSE or not, the SBQ was bs either way, because you have no control over who is there. First times, yes you are motivated to fully participate and you craft special ammo, but later you see that there are level 25 with pipe pistols and they get rewarded same way as you do. That totally pull your motivation down and makes you question, why are you the one who goes extra mile, but gets rewarded same as those who only go hundred meters. This is why I don't bother doing damage in SBQ. If under performers can go there and get same rewards, I can then go and under perform too. 
---
World of Warcraft raids have (or had, haven't played for while) excellent tools and option to remove freeloaders/under performers. First you get to see their achievements, then you can inspect their gear and see their gear score and last you get to see their damage in real time.  And this created atmosphere, where I wanted to go and get better gear, because it mattered. 
---
In ESO, you kinda can hide also behind hidden stats and freeload pug vet dungeons. Team damage is visible, but you can't tell who is doing how much and when one dps is slacking off, both dps can get kicked even tho only 1 failed. Sad part is, both dps know who is slacking, but its a word against word. Luckily, for more serious raiding, raid leader can let every dps prove their damage on dummy, that prints score to public chat. So in the end ESO is taking just extra step to do what WoW does to eliminate under performers.
---
More than ever, I'd wish Fallout 76 had somekind of official recount mod or scoreboard at the end of the event, because I get no sense of progression when I improve my gear and do SBQ. I think in such online game it is important to give user back a such feedback. It gives user sense of him improving his gear matters, he can clearly see that his damage went 50% up.
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
This is true. I can't remember how many times that thing killed me.
---
No problem
---
I'm getting strong Far Harbour vibes here. :)
---
\&gt; U mad
---
Thanks for the insightful comment.
---
Too bad you're too stupid to piece together I'm a BloodedEtC support build saying it's superstrong.
---
Salty AF. I don't even know what any of that means
---
An example of a laser weapon at peak performance in 76.
---
Not entirely accurate. Therer is a mod that reduces ap use while power attacking in all melee. 
---
So... why are you on this sub?  Just to troll? 
---
Nice. Always keep a machete on me, handy for dealing with molerats and radroaches. Very good find.
---
It happens sometimes. Do not really know why. When it happens it's always the first login for me.
---
I’ll def add you when I get the chance
---
WE. ARE. LEGION.
---
You don't know what Bloodied is and you think you're not stupid.
---
Carry a shotgun and at least enforcer 1. No need for dmg card for it it is for utility. Aim for SB wqings and destroy it on the ground. Shooting rifles and heavy weapons at flying SB is just a waste of ammo. You shotgun doesn't  need to be crazy. A basic one will do my fav type for this job are the ones with reload speed, movement speed, dmg reduction and quad etc. 
---
I like it!
---
I’ve seen the search option in some of the bear proof trash cans too around the map
---
I know what Bloodied is
---
You can launch a nuke on your own. You don't need to be in a team. 
---
Picture it, you're standing on the brow of a hill, scortched horde in the distance getting closer. You glance at them coming, load your minigun, make some arnie-style quip, flip down your visor and run full pelt shouting battlecries and raining bullets on them.
---
I'd love to do that.
---
I'd knock off 250 for you and do 2750
---
And that is where my problem lies, I tend to pick the first perk, usually strength, then look @ my options, to see what I would like next. Scroll through and I’m like yes that, awwww wtf now I have more points in a special and no cards and a perk card I cannot use without swapping for another.
---
This had me curious about it too. 
---
You need thelp from a low level player. They'll spawn low level ghouls who always on golf clothing. That's how I did it.
---
How else he suppose to grow? Get over yourself 
---
The launching might be better solo since unexperienced/distracted players will loot or get lost. Meaning they will double the enemie spawn if you wander of too far alone.
---
We might find when the brewing and distilling dlc drops that Nukashine is just such a beverage requiring flux to brew
---
also motion assist gives STR points increasing all melee/unarmed dmg.
---
there are exceptions. Like the hotrod paint job gives a little ap bonus. (flames make you go fast I guess...)
---
Sure you do, that's why you made a post saying you didn't know what the most meta build in the game is.
---
go call people salty somewhere else kid.
---
I found it inconsitent all along. For example, at 1 point I could fit my little shack with two machine guns. Nothing stored. I got aggrivated by constant scorchbeasts so moved, for some reason now I had two heavy lassr turrets in storage and placeable. Then I moved/scrapped some stuff and go from 75%-100% for no apparent reason.
---
Its as if I have things in storage but I dont. Level 130, played since beta
---
Level 92 here with 35 CAMPs, the level has never changed and everything has stayed the same. 
---
I always lock my doors, even the interior ones, because at my old camp location by Summersville, I would always come home to a Supermutant or two in my kitchen. I have 3 doors in my house, front, bedroom, and upstairs porch. If I didn't lock all 3, my unwelcome guests would appear, and they would never have any goodies for me. If I locked the doors, I'd just have Supermutants in my garden. I've since moved my camp, but I'm paranoid about Supermutants in the kitchen.
---
Yes, you have to do it to the end (approx 1 hour, the part around the glass cavern and inside can be tough depending on your level).
---
Escape to Adventure!
---
Stupid humans, always killing for no other reason but to satisfy themselves. I always eat what I hunt and never take more than I need. 
---
Refills your ap 👍
---
Can't even be mad tbh. If you decide to play 76 make peace with the fact that it will happen tbh. I've lost connection during the fight and death of the SQB more then I can count. When almost completing the silo aswell. Or when the combat state bugs out and you can't leave after firing up the nuke. You enjoy lasers and such? Well be prepared for when someone uses it on the wueen. Freezing frames for 10 sec or more at times. 
---
There's one in Morgantown almost at the city limits after the monorail I believe
---
Because no one uses them. They are so underpowered that there is currently no reason to do so, and some of them even degrade faster than other weapons. I don't think most people would even notice if energy weapons were taken out of the game tomorrow.
---
An early quest gives you Somerset Special Revolver. Nice early Weapon. Depending on your build, a Grognak’s Axe is available from Level 15 I think (but could be wrong). I know that a GA was one of my earliest melee Legendary Weapons. 
---
All the really good weapons are locked behind higher levels, so your best bet now is just to level up. Claiming workshops is what I did early on. Tiy get a nice item rewards that include plans and XP. Plus, the first Defend mission starts immediately and gives you a chance to XP farm a lot of low level enemies. Just be warned, try not to use turrets. Turret kills do not give you XP (but will complete the defend mission). 
---
Good luck. Don’t be afraid to team up with a mid or even high level. Many are nice and will share some goods as help you advance. 
---
Define "normally" ?
---
You could only use powered doors with a pressure plate, and those only open when apply power. 
---
Interacting with the door normally wouldn't open it.
---
Rrally? I missed that. Where is that said? 
---
Motion-assisted servos in a Torso mod. OP asked about arms.
---
I think you have some genuine issues that you should get checked out. I am a bloodied build and I'm definitely not a kid
---
Sure loser who goes around calling people talking about video game builds salty, you're a real normal person.
---
Anything else useless you want to share or did you just want to sperg out at me for no reason.
---
Select structure no longer works for me. It only selects a couple parts. I keep hoping this will get patched.
---
ay thanks. I read over it and got hung up on the unarmed convo, my b.
---
Genuine. Mental. Issues.
---
You can do it alone but it takes a LOT of bullets lol 
---
That's not me. I just clicked the #Fallout76 hashtag on Twitter this afternoon when I suggested someone else do so in another thread I was posting in, and this video happened to come up. I thought it was funny and interesting so I posted it here. I've actually never seen anything by this guy before today, but the idea was entertaining enough to me to be worth sharing. 
---
Oh so you didn't have anything to say about the Video game?
---
how surprising, want to explain why you being upset at people over a video game build isn't autism?
---
Bye loser
---
Alone is easier.  
---
&gt; A boatload of junk to short circuit the finding mainframe searching bit by building them at a tinker's bench. 
---
Totally unnecessary since he benches inside are tied to your stash. No need to risk losing your supplies. Also, if you loot the bots, you'll pick up most, of not all, of the steel and circuits you need to repair the cores by the time you get there. 
---
I’ll tell you the same thing I told the op. I have a laser rifle that does just fine. I get 30 shots per cell and can down mobs just shy of my lever actions ttk. Not to mention I only need to repair it once day. 
---
Having it degrade faster makes sense in the lore and it’s justified. 
---
In a game with pvp people are use to using ballistic weapons and for good reason energy can do damage with the right setup. 
---
Incorrect. Optimized bracers is applied via a perk. In order to apply the effect WeaponTypeUnarmed \[KYWD:0005240E\] has to be 1.
---
Given that you cannot equip anything on PA with that keyword with the possible exception of the Meat Hook, and this would qualify as an exploit because it has both the one hand and the unarmed keywords therefore I have not tried it, my statement remains accurate.
---
Are you kidding? Watoga is in the middle of Scorch Beast territory. They wander in there all the time. 
---
Nice CAMP! You probably got to hop servers to spawn your camp, that is a hot location for vault dwellers.
---
This was pretty awesome. Your ability to tell a story is phenomenal too. I could picture everything in my mind like a comic book.
---
Cool story, and cool on you for helping out.
---
Vendors?
---
Please discuss this exchange with your anger management therapist. If you don't have one ask your GP for a reccomendation and they will point you on the right direction. Good luck, you're gonna need it in your life.
---
You can do it in 15 minutes solo. 
---
thanks guy who spends his time on reddit calling random people who aren't even talking to him Salty 
---
I'll make sure to take your life advice, I sure want to end up like you.
---
It’s told in the weapons lore that the internals are moving mirrors, glass, crystals and others all work to throw the beam. 
---
Plasma is a ball of hot goo and gauss is just a piece metal charged and fired a ultra speeds. Recoil is recoil. 
---
Your math is wrong.   As is your “logic.”
---
always seem to get it on first SBQ kill, happened to 3 of my characters. However, I didn't get it anymore after getting the first one.
---
THIS
---
Hopefully when they fix that, they also fix the ammo craft number. I'm sure it should be 50 and not just 5, someone messed up 
---
Whitesprings. Heading back to the main building from the golf course it's in a bungalow on the right ..bathroom.
---
Several of my guns are bloodied, and nooooo I didn't reapply. No way, I KNEW something was off! I swear my damage output dropped recently after a patch and I'm like wtf did they do? But my effects menu is still displaying Adrenal Reaction applied. Yikes, what did they mess up?
---
So should I just craft another and drink? My marsupial is still working ok, so I figured my adrenal reaction was too.
---
Duh. 
---
Considering I purchased the plan tonight and applied them to 4 different sets of armor I know its false. A plan from watoga vendor. Not a perk.
---
Saw 3 nukes yesterday on PC. Which was nice because I needed flux.
---
That's fantastic.
---
Early on. Pipe, pump shotgun and hunting rifles are a dime a dozen. Get enough of them and you’ll have pretty decent one to use until the good guns become available. 
---
I'm mostly anti people. That's my main reason. I also have traps, fences, and other stuff to deter people. 
---
No.
---
I'm genuinely thrilled you want to end up free of anger issues like me. The first step is admitting you have a problem and it's the hardest. I'm glad you made it.
---
This tells me that you truly do not understand what you are talking about.
---
Open the .esm in xEdit, search for \_PARENT\_mod\_PowerArmor\_GENERIC\_Optimized "TEMPLATE: Optimized Bracers" \[OMOD:003D4E59\]
---
You will see that if references:
---
EnchPowerArmor\_CommonArm "PA Common Arm" \[ENCH:00248490\]
---
Which in turn references:
---
PowerArmor\_CommonArmEffect "PA Common Arm Effect" \[MGEF:0024848F\]
---
Which finally references:
---
PA\_CommonArmPerk "PA Common Arm Perk" \[PERK:0024848E\] &lt; - yes, a Perk
---
Where the condition:
---
WeaponTypeUnarmed \[KYWD:0005240E\]
---
Has to be 1 (TRUE) for the modifier to apply.
---
You actually think this is a burn don't you.
---
Sure you don't have any anger issues guy who goes around on /r/Fallout76 calling people salty for saying builds are strong
---
You are totally normal and well adjusted and not a pathetic loser at all
---
I would love a higher camp budget. I come across some camps in the wild and can't believe how much they were able to build.
---
I put down three turrets, two water purifiers, a few walls and one of each workbench and that's it budget is full and no more items for me.
---
Like I said at the beginning you come across what some people have managed to do it blows my mind. I would love to spend a few hours building an awesome camp. Especially in time for when the new player vending machines drop!
---
Reddit is not advertising site, and its against rules to promote your own videos here.  Check them out for once.
---
What happened in your life to make you so angry and unhappy?
---
This needs upvoting!
---
There is one at Charleston Capitol Building, IIRC in a bathroom
---
get a hunting rifle and a grognak axe or any 2 handed melee. From lv30 and up you can use powerfist as a alternative. Learn to use shotguns for utility on Scorchbeast not damage per see.Don't be afraid to swap around weapons to use all types of ammo and making farming less tedious. That's also why I suggested a decent melee as it is easily one of the most low maintenance weapon types and really really strong. Going a few str points at the start helps to boost your damage and carry weight. Also if you ar eusing multiple weapon classes do not fear about having to max all damage cards. I run tier 1 of 3 damage cards per weapon in endgame most of the time.
---
I was level 27 the other night (31 now) and out with a level 44 and 52. For one SB we encountered, after I died lol, I ran into this little patch of trees and used my Black Powder Rifle to bring its health down. The trees were oddly pretty effective for cover. My friends might have been shooting too. Idk, they were on the other side of the field chatting. It didn't land until it's health was almost gone. And the other two meleed it dead.
---
Then we had to defend a workshop against three SBs. By that time, there were 4 or 5 of us. Tbh, I don't even remember how that went down exactly. But I was told that's about as difficult as it gets. (I'm not sure about that lol.) 
---
I will say that it helps to have others around to help. And try to take cover somewhere where you can still shoot.
---
We have them. Its just rare to run into, and I'm not sure this is the reddit people usually advertise their cool bases on. 
---
I ran into a neat looking base like this at WS once though I also think it might have been a deathtrap. I fast travel out just before the flamers came on.
---
You CAN solo it.  But its harder IMO.
---
Hacking the terminals are the way to do it.    I typically take about 45 mins to do it and use alot of bullets and stims.
---
I guess others have short cuts and know exactly where to go to get around majority of bots.  
---
Stand by fuckhead.
---
Keep it until the Purveyor shows up in May, then you might be able to trade it for another fourstar legendary.
---
please stop, it's just pathetic that you are acting like you didn't start this conversation by blundering in like an embarrassment. 
---
do you have literally anything game related at all to say?
---
Damn. That's all I'm finding too wth 
---
Hunting rifles are great early weapons. Easily obtained from super mutants. When you get duplicates scrap them to learn mods to increase damage. Can also use the mods to make it into a sniper rifle
---
Alone is easier the first time on the same server. The next time, you'll be facing a lot more 50+ enemies from the getgo. In team, sometimes it is easier: if the lower level teammate enters first (like lvl 50-70), the turrets and enemies will be lower level as well (lvl 28 turrets vs lvl 40 turrets).
---
Ammo-vise, 500-800 is a typical amount for guns-blazing runs.
---
You can also keep the damaged mainframe cores, repair them outside the silo and bring a fresh set for the next run. Saves about 5 minutes in case you don't have the resources and need to farm the robots.
---
PVP does it aswell just because it simply can.
---
IDK maybe you were beaten too much as a child or something? 
---
Very cool.
---
I've stopped making camps because of greifers 🙁
---
Im sorry, im just frustrated that people hate a decent game from an over all great series.
---
But in terms of content, i think it is snack sized. I mean you can beat the main quest in... i dunno, 20 hours? The side quests in probably not much more. I think that part of it I'm a little peeved about. Though free updates are coming 🤞
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ah8znh/breakdown_of_damage_numbers_for_the_upcoming_tse/
---
Its very simple.  The perks are multiplied as well as the TSE.  So when the extra from perks is added, that too is multipled on the TSE factor giving you far more dmg than intended.  
---
What needs to happen is each factor is multipled (Off base dmg of weapon) and then *Added* to the weapon. Then you will have true values.   
---
Hey there, just a follow up. After about a dozen builds I have the hardened receiver, stinging clip, suppressor and long scope. Pretty much all I need. I retired my beloved .45 rifle once the handmade's damage exceeded it. Happy days.
---
Always check lunchboxes and trashbins in the every station, I and many other players leave a lot of stuff for other players.
---
I stopped buildings camps because of griefers 🙁
---
There is literally nothing you can do. It costs them nothing to keep coming after it even if you try to fight them
---
The real demoralizing part is how expensive it is to fix stuff like a decon arch
---
Fair call. 
---
Oh dear. No blueprints show up, I'm assuming?
---
Turrets aren't very scary to players. They can barely kill mobs.
---
Look at my profile I put a pic of the mod from my station. 🤷 False.
---
Nope, BUT I’m much happier since moving, extra build space, two free guns, no scorchbeasts. Its great lol. But that first camp budget. That was looooow.
---
Happens when too many people are around, for example, in Whitesprings. Often though, new regular enemy spawn will have legendaries you missed. Try to avoid farming while other people are around (which is hard I know in a lucrative nuke zone).
---
Also last night I was on a server (PC) where there were no 2\*-3\* enemies spawing at all. I've killed over 100 1\* legendaries all over the map.
---
Based on [813 drops](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wuz0Hej1N5UOeXGvXKiq6h9N-utjWjhiFdqXLvfDwu8/edit#gid=717308889), 2\* enemies have a 50-50% chance to drop 1\* or 2\* loot. 3\* enemies have a 30-30-40% chance each, but they show up only 15% of the time for me. Overall, you have a **90%** chance for a 1\* drop from any legendary enemy.
---
Because heads are to heavy. 🤷
---
f
---
Sounds awesome! I farmed Whitesprings last night on PC but even post-nuke, every glowing one dropped 1\* and haven't seen any 2-3\* enemies for hours (over 100 drops). RNG or glitched server, I don't know?
---
/u/Imgur_Lurker and /u/lmfaofallout76
---
Okay both of you, stop right there.
---
As I had already told you by the time you posted this comment, it's not my video. I'm posting someone else's video that I happened to find on Twitter. 
---
There is a cheat for it.  They really need to make it so you actually must have all 8 pieces in inventory in order to put the code in.
---
Some of us honestly just never figured out how to use the social functions. I don't even know how to accept a team invite if I wanted to, and I didn't know until you mentioned it that you could even send people messages. I don't know where I'd check for messages. (PS4)
---
Looks great!
---
Marathoner doesn't work in Power Armor.
---
God damn it...
---
Thanks for the info 🙂
---
Got bored of standing by.
---
Baked some humble pie for you and left it cooling in the windosill for later, don't choke on it.
---
Because why would you initiate killing somebody and not expect some sort of drawback? 
---
Posted a pic of my power armor station with the mod on it on my profile. This sub wouldn't lemme put it here. 🤷 
---
It was accidental and I had killed him once already
---
They're [legendary effects](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects)
---
Lol
---
I keep a stash and all workbenches outside so you homeless people don’t have to come in my house. 
---
Because the devs wanted a safe space and created repercussions for going against that.
---
There is a fallout builder on a website, just go there and play around with the perks.

---
Really depends on what weapons you want to use.
---
I have main character 200+ and a mule/team assistance character at 60. List of good drops from my main is empty, not a single item yet. Not saying 0 threestars, just 0 good legendary effect combinations. My mule, on the other hand, looted a cavalier left leg and a bloody explosive gattling. RNG being a bitch contirmed.
---
Interesting to learn there is a cap limit.
---
I geuss that's why the serum recipes cost that much.
---
Fill the place with land mines? So can you actually place more than two if you place different kinds of mines? 
---
Which platform? I don't mind being a guinea pig. I'm on Xbox.
---
I haven’t heard someone refer to killing someone as claiming before, where does it come from?
---
When your server hopped didn’t the low level lose the workshop you put everything into defending?
---
I enjoyed your tale :)
---
There are some cool effects that are the most crucial effects in the game that are minor effects and are only available on 3 star armor. Im talking bout sentinels and cavaliers obviously. 
---
I blame the parents.
---
You are confusing apples and oranges.
---
The plan is required becuase is a condition in the COBJ record. The plan 'entitles' you to craft the mod.
---
This has nothing to do with how the game applies the effect.
---
Perks are not just the cards that you choose in your SPECIAL section.
---
Perks are used internally by the engine to apply a multitude of effect of check a multitude of conditions.
---
Applying Optimised Bracers to the PA arms is a waste of resources unless you are going to punch the mobs with your bare knuckles.
---
This is an irrefutable fact that anyone can check. 
---
On PS4. Thanks 
---
i lost my x01 Stealth boy to being scrapped to build a wall, i know your pain brother
---
I've been farming Whitesprings all day, and I didn't get a single decent drop.
---
Where/How do I find people selling? 
---
This would make all that ammo I drop worth keeping. Would need a system works into pacifist to differentiate between this helpful friendly fire and slap damage. Not sure such a thing exists or how it would work. We used to try  shoot queen with karma while she was flying so when she landed the neg effects where active. NVR knew it it worked. But popping the melee with it when she landed did so the neg effects could ware off after she took to the skies again. But the add situation lately kinda rendered that plan too dangerous to attempt.
---
You know you can now tame a bhramin too? This way it will have your name on it and,presumebly,won't be killed.
---
game has been out what...111 days?  That's 7 hours a day since release roughly.  Damn, some of you guys need a girlfriend, lol
---
And that's why I'll be chilling in Adventure Mode with my friends, crack open a beer and passing around a bong filled with glowing fungus.
---
&gt;  I mean you can beat the main quest in... i dunno, 20 hours?
---
So about the same play-time as *Metro: Exodus*.
---
I can't imagine *why* you'd want to finish the main quest in 20 hours though.  In my 210 hours I've yet to launch my first nuke.
---
There is not a single bad idea written into your post, dear OP. I think our perspective on the game differs, as post lacked PvP related suggestions and Im PvP oriented, but I do believe each thing you wrote down would make the game more enjoyable for everyone.

Your mistake is thinking that Pacifist Mode affects incoming damage.
---
It doesn’t...so in a way, your CAMP is already in Pacifist Mode.

Ykno what’d be badass? Having all the terminals in the world connected, so people could send out their own lil messages. 
---
Lol not sure, probably his first time getting picked on.
---
Your lucky.
---
You got in at a time when majority of the existing exploits for item duping are patched.
---
Item duping involves lagging out the server to the point you DC.   So what you are experiencing now is quite stable... compared to what it was.
---
Try going through the Mirelurk cave and getting lagged out every 5 seconds for 30 minutes.   I just gave up on the cave and had to swap servers.
---
&gt; does the explosives perk effect the damage and the shotgunner perks effect the damage output?
---
yes
---
&gt; I'm getting bored of being one shot by melee weapons
---
It's a p big hassle fandangling fights vs melee as range, you've got to make sure your first shot to trigger the fight is outside of their Vats range imo and you won't get VATs'd and die before you can fire your second shot
---
Got one on PC if you'd like it.
---
I think Bethesda is currently in such position that them saying anything to us is a risk of a backlash, the amount of fake news that are circulating around the game is worth a scientific analysis. I do believe that such survey would be a way to gather feedback that would minimise the risk and the magnitude of potential backlash.
---
Related to fake news, I recently met some friends and I said I still play the game. They were like WTF mate it cant be played. One of them watched a movie on YT that stated, as follows: there is a single nuke code thats hardcoded into the game so if somebody cracks that code and shares it, rest of the players can launch a nuke without any problems using characters at all levels. This is the level of ignorance and misinformation that surrounds the game and defined environmental conditions in which all the makers-community interactions take place. Just look at Fallout fanpages and see how many comments there come from people who haven't played 76.
---
Eagle eye, better criticals and vats crit dmg on weapon over 450 attack why not.
---
would be great to buff party, or heal, or even put more debuffs on targets. I like the endangerol barrel, I actually have  a syringer with it on my inventory. Always. Great when going against deathclaws, or any heavy hitter ingame.
---
Especially for those players like me that enjoy not going full min max, with my "common setup", having a syringer, or more that would cause certain benefit is a great increase to the player overall performance
---
Non- automatic rifles and power armor.
---
I have three characters with different builds.
---
The heavy gunner:
---
3* .50 Machine gun (Anti-armor, limb damage, 250 DR while reloading)
---
1* Gatling gun (Anti-armor)
---
1* Assault rifle (Two shot)
---
All rise
---
The explosives expert:
---
3* Auto grenade launcher (Anti-armor, limb damage, weight reduction)
---
1* Handmade rifle (Two shot)
---
A plethora of pistols and revolvers
---
The non-power armor rifleman (still leveling him up):
---
1* Handmade rifle (Anti-armor)
---
1* Pump-action shotgun (+dmg to ghouls)
---
Honestly it feels like an “ode to fallout” for me, I genuinely thought fallout 4 was so uninspired and boring, I wanted to shoot my head off while playing through it. NV was amazing, literally I wish they would remaster it because I would fucking shit everywhere getting to know Benny (who was voiced by Matthew Perry, I didn’t know!) all over again. 3 was a great game, but not an amazing one. Fallout 76 though is just so beautiful, I love every second of it! I think I’m slowly starting to put more hours into this game than I have any other fallout! 
---
I done my first silo solo and it took around 2 hours lol so maybe set yourself a bit of extra time also.
---
I do, but I just can't seem to deal damage.
---
I love the smell of capitalism in the morning.
---
That is genuinely awesome! I am incredibly envious of your neat and orderly purifiers. My uneven efforts trigger my OCD something fierce xD
---
One more thing. Just remembered I've seen this creepy stretched out noodle vicious mongrel jiggling and clipping is way around the SBQ fight a few times now and I'm not sure if I've ever killed it but pretty sure it's still attacking and doing damage. Not such a big deal, but odd and annoying to be sure. 
---
PatrickC808
---
Yeah, the endangerol barrel stays useful because it doesn't have a hard cap on the damage reduction. I should really try to unlock it on every character...
---
The workshop was empty, nothing built on it. Pointless to keep. The level 45 only wanted his junk back, which I got back. Honestly, i would want my junk back too if i was carrying that much.
---
What’s your PSN?
---
I lock my main house becuase off the same reasons people have already states( leaving main door open). I do have a garage and water for everone to use, the catch is you just need to find my place and if you do then you are more than wellcome to use it. 
---
Oh thanks for being nice but i'm on pS4 and i use Tesla Coil now, i actually had a Emergency Protocols I traded off to my teamate who could use it way better. 
---
just a bitter FO memory for me like the time I went up  Trinity Tower  to get Strong and Piper didn't come down the tower with me ;_:
---
Do *not* do the "Mayor For A Day" quest in Watoga until you hit level 50. You get the All-Rise super sledge as a reward and it matches your level when you complete it. It's a very good melee weapon.
---
Btw, why do you even need decontamination arch, when radaway is so abundant?
---
I actually don't even put doors on my camp anymore. I've found that the ideal player-friendly and enemy-unfriendly  entrance is a single foundation, two doors facing each other, closed in by two walls facing each other, no roof and a barrier or guard post in the middle.  
---
Players can easily jump over it, but mobs get as far as the barrier and stand there attacking it while a turret chews them up! 
---
Sent you a pm 
---
The ghost sounds a heck of a lot like the high level player that came and snatched the junk yard from me a few days ago. I went back after half an hour and claimed it back unchallenged but he had stripped it bare.
---
You would have to do this for four hours every day to reach 100K in 30 days.  While yes it’s absurd that Bethesda would ban anyone for that, I don’t think anyone using this method has to worry about it even for a moment.
---
Adjust your perks to specialize in weapons.
---
If you do rifles get the first perk in all rifle perks:
---
star rifleman, expert rifleman, master rifleman (or commando perks)
---
Get Tormentor (luck perk) if you are rifle.
---
Get + crit chance/damage perks.
---
Get penetration mods for the guns.
---
If have auto-fire weapon, get gun-fu with the Grim reaper perk.
---
If melee, get incisor (penetration mod), stay away from low damage melee weapons.  Best with high damage slow weapons due to damage resists.
---
Actually, powered speakers let you choose an instrument and note!
---
It's probably all around way too impractical to use but they exist in the game. Would be cool to see someone use them well.
---
&gt;  I'm hoping the devs have made some positive changes.
---
RNG.  
---
Luck also affects the quality of the legendary.
---
Do you still have these plans 
---
The only 2 locked doors in my Camp is the toilet and my Artillery. 
---
There's a Port-a-loo outside for visitors.
---
...right. Ok, my objection is based on my limited grasp of the concept of time, not reality.  That's a nice change. 
---
Yeah. Don't flamers consume pretty heavy volumes of fuel, to boot?
---
There's one in the Charleston Fire Department, slightly hidden, tucked up against a fire truck.
---
There's also one in Lewisville I think it's called, in an alley near all that Spring Market stuff or whatever it is.
---
Don't forget Wavy Willard's.
---
I built my camp 6 stories high with the last 2 stories being the actual building and the first four being a stairwell. I'll never lock my doors as I want valiant explorers to experience my vertical elevated base. If they time it right too, they can watch a nuke being launched and detonating at Fissure Prime
---
Rad away makes you more likely to get diseases for a long time, but you're still right.
---
It's better to just use the decon arch at the institute if I really wanted to use one.
---
Just a nice convenience to have one at your base.
---
&gt; When I'm at anchor I run off solar panels so I can only play a few hours in the afternoon.
---
You need to do the powering up event a few times, that'll give you the plans for the fusion generator.
---
I hate being griefed and having my CAMP attacked. It's happened several times and I really love to build a nice house to live in, but I understand why Bethesda have done building this way.
---
If you think of the base builder as a griefer and think of what would happen if some one invited you to their camp and then put a wall in front of the door or removed the floor from under you.
---
What I think they missed completely is server hopping. If someone locked me in and I was overencumbered I would server-hop. There's basically nothing you can build in your base that can motivate the rules as they are now. If I built a house over a cliff I can't remove the floor under the player, but I could move my CAMP or log off to make them fall to their death.
---
insight?
---
Incitation?
---
A slider for crafting lots of ammo/food/etc. at once would be nice.
---
I played PC on and off most of the weekend and saw nothing! I probably should have server hopped but it's such an effort..
---
A few days ago I helped out a group of 3 in a silo and they launched on Prime, off center so V9 was clear. The 4 of us started the queen fight and she started dropping health nicely, up until 5 more other people showed up and the fight became a crawl. We won after 25 minutes, 5k ammo and a broken-glitched gun I could keep firing with.
---
My observations of 20 SBQs, 3 after Patch 5 and 3 after Patch 6:
---
* Awareness doesn't seem to show DR scaling. She had 300 DR. I'd assume her health scales or there is a visual glitch for the DR display. I lean towards health because DR scaling has diminishing returns, thus you don't need twice the ammo for double DR.
---
* She is more resistant in air, even to headshots.
---
* This is unconfirmed and only saw it happen a few times, but non-scorched enemies (such as robots or super mutants) may also trigger the scaling since Patch 6.
---
* I tried an Anti-armor Prime .50 Cal with Stabilized 3, which setup should ignore 77.5% of armor. 2k rounds and barely did any dent. (Incisor Anti-armor ignores 87.5%, Tank killer, Anti-armor Perforating ignores 80.8%). I think the ignore is capped at 90% anyway.
---
* She sometimes glitches out on the ground and does nothing. Sustained staggering?
---
* She sometimes comes back after the 30 minutes has passed and she decided to leave.
---
* Based on patch notes, she has custom logic built specifically for her (unlike the other on-foot enemies). I firmly believe the queen is bugged due to logical errors in her code.
---
&gt; I'm asking content wise how do they get the incentive to grind this specific game that much. 
---
&gt;&gt; my friend got the game as a gift upon release
---
Maybe you could read the messages other people write?
---
I forgot about pacifist, but it's an important issue. I'll put it on the "let's hope BGS figures it out" pile.
---
This isn't a bug per se, this is just inventory management, and honestly I suspect this is probably one of the first and foremost things the majority of players should look at to clear space. So this is a good post.
---
Like looking at your stash, wtf do you have over 900 circuits and over 900 fiberglass? Sell that stuff. You'll be rich.
---
Things people should look at in their inventory and stash to free up space (of the top of my head):
---
- Burnt books or comics or burnt anything.
---
- Black Titanium Scrap or Ore or whatever it is
---
- Circuits
---
- Gold
---
- Silver
---
- one of the two Fiberglasses (you can bulk one, not the other)
---
- Asbestos I believe
---
- Waste Antiseptic
---
I might be forgetting something.
---
Look at your gunpowder and raw ore collection as well. If you're not making ammo, wtf should you have 1000 gunpowder for example? Also make sure to smelt all your raw ore.
---
username checks out
---
I didnt think they excisted :0 
---
Depends on playstyle or what your trying to use Handmade for.
---
Long barrels use more AP but longer range.  So good for sniper or single shot builds.
---
Short Barrels use less AP and better for mid-close range builds.
---
Some stocks add more + Sight Accuracy while others better for hip-fire.
---
Scopes all have benefits based on range as well.    
---
Check out the wiki charts for some of the "hidden" stats for each mod.    They helped me a great deal.
---
Yes, then PvP would be about skill and make PvP exciting not depending on the amount boost you apply... Bethesda nor high level players want that though
---
If you have a look at the excellent 'Community Patch Notes':
---
[https://despotak.github.io/fallout\_76\_patch\_notes/](https://despotak.github.io/fallout_76_patch_notes/)
---
You will notice that the values for Adrenal Reaction were reworked in the last patch:
---
[https://despotak.github.io/fallout\_76\_patch\_notes/v1.0.6.0.html#spell](https://despotak.github.io/fallout_76_patch_notes/v1.0.6.0.html#spell)
---
However there is some indication that this might have been a mistake rather than a stealth nerf based on the comments by one of the community managers in a thread on this subject.
---
I cannot for the life of me find the thread now but if your reddit-fu is more powerful than mine search for recent threads on the subject of Adrenal Reaction where 'Bethesda Replied'.
---
yeah i was looking at the wiki. very helpful i might consider switching my barrel since i read what you mentioned.
---
That's super cool! As I'm on Ps4 so I won't be able to visit. :(
---
I just recently helped the robots kill a Scorchbeast in Watoga... The corpse landed on a roof and despawned right before I got to it because it took so long to find the way up there. No loot for me.
---
i may just keep true long barrel on though because its a TSE and i find most of my battles to be medium to long range. cant get too close or i hurt myself lol
---
then turn pacifist mode on 
---
Or maybe just make it possible to shoot all drugs at people maybe aside from buffout since they're pills. But I feel like this would actually add a support playstyle which would be great.
---
Kewl an item I haven't found yet. Where was it?
---
Good ole file 13. 👍 ☹️
---
will have to look into it. i do not run a vats build though.
---
I think this is an amazing idea, but considering this game doesn't really entice group play at all in its existing content I feel this would be welcome down the road when the vaults open. They could take the opportunity to address some of the balance issues then in detail to help create a healthy group dichotomy.
---
thanks for the tips. i know what game im trolling next now. lol
---
Are you on PC? Can I buy some mutations off of you so I can fix my adrenal reaction? I can make adrenal mutation, just not a lot of others.
---
If you remove then really it it works again, although the positive effects still don't list on pip boy it's working. 
---
As a guy who's been there for other seemingly booting games to grind at, I can relate to what you said. Being unemployed or unfit for work/duty can put you in a bad spot, having something to do in game, no matter how boring it is, is kinda relaxing and helps going through the day with a sense of purpose. Even if it's pointless.
---
Or do with most griefers do, team up with 1 person, get wanted by attacking camps and have another person 1 shot the victim when they shoot the wanted.
---
In-game name?
---
Why do they stealth nerf? Like, serious question. It basically is gaslighting us and shows massive disrespect to their player base. Like, I just don't understand why they don't want to be upfront and direct about their tweaks.
---
Sent pm 
---
Ah, I'm an idiot. I completely forgot that you can't open them with a switch. Apologies for the misinformation, and thank you for the correction. I will delete my previous reply now so I don't lead anyone astray.  
---
The gods demand explosions! Tho orbital strike at it and ride off into the sunset a hero!
---
My educated guess is that is a spurious result of a glitched NPC record not very different to finding a group of supermutants all of them proudly donning the label 'Mutant Hound'.
---
Actually I met both Flatwood monster and Mothman between Safe n' clean disposal and Whitespring, which are randomly spawned near my CAMP.
---
You are hilarious and evil at the same time, I'd probably freak out if I were in the other player's position.
---
If someone played 800 hours of video games I wouldn’t blink an eye, but playing 800 hours of this low content short game Seems bonkers. You can easily finish every single quest in like 40 hours. 
---
Get enforcer bud, aim for the legs. No more running to get in vats range. *As a melee I can't believei just typed this*
---
She gets more HP the more people there. Which I don't understand why it's kind of ridiculous. I feel as though they should just give her a hefty chunk of reasonably set HP, shouldn't matter how many players are there she's a "raid" boss. Because when a level 20-30 shows up and they can't contribute a lot of damage but she still gets like 50k+ more HP for that player being there is just a bad thing to have happen. 
---
AVR Medical Center, from the front (red awning) head counter clockwise, she's near some crates &amp; a dumpster, the external wall is on three sides
---
satan, you said? 
---
I killed +50 unlruly lvl 9 ghouls today with an lvl 11 alt… but the quest didn't ever show!!!
---
A shame, it's not easy to get Whitespings only for you...
---
I considered it.  I really.  really did.  or using the turrets to find out who owned it, then seeing if they owned any workshops, and contesting it to draw them out and kill them but avoid a bounty.
---
It's for the Race for the Presidency event that's not currently "active" in the game. The valid ballout is an item you get when you turn in your printed out ballouts at polling stations. 
---
Wether or not Beth will ever activate it is not known.
---
I believe its part of an unreleased/in development PVP event. Something to do with the Presidential suite in Whitesprings.
---
As far as I read, you have to run around gathering the ballots and handing them in- whoever ends up with the most, gets to be President of the server (?) and gains access to the Presidential suite.. which has a special set of power armor and gauss I think?
---
ask Todd
---
Agree. Listening to classical music (serious music if you will), western or other world equivalent including Jazz, is anything but passive and can include researching the composer and their cultural background, how the music developed to it's current standard, then there is the whole story behind what the composers are trying to achieve/say in their art or what is represents from a cultural perspective, their influences and the relationship to contemporaries all this is in your mind as you listen to the work.
---
Listening to music can be relaxing, but it can also require full engagement of ones mental faculties and using what one has learned about the music to bring out its intricacies and is anything but relaxing.
---
I think PvP will always be broken unless they remove vats and legendary weapons unfortunately, I was literally headshotting a lvl 134 the other day with my anti amour lever action rifle and he couldn't do shit to me because he was a melee build, I was lvl 33.
---
&gt; ~~wether~~ whether or not it is worth it
---
Well, I paid about 26 Eurocents/hour so far.
---
Seriously:
---
1. It has bugs.  This weekend I had one CTD just after starting it.  I also saw one enemy I killed vanish^1.  I've had worse days, but it's never been unplayable for me^2.
---
2. I wouldn't waste money on anything other than the standard edition myself.  (I got it for 55 EUR on prerelease).
---
3. The FO 1/2/3/Tactics offer is finished.  They cost almost nothing on GOG anyway.
---
4. VATS works pretty well, there is no slowdown like in FO4, but it does auto-aim for you.  I don't interact with other players much myself, just a few emotes.
---
Lvl 95 you should be able do whitesprings by yourself. I was doing it at Lvl 50 no problem 
---
Bulking isn't necessary for selling but for the junk you can bulk you'll get more caps. Not that this helps anyone with the idiotic caps limit of 1400 a day. 
---
I just destroy those turret camp, idc of getting a wanted level lol
---
Perception perks: Rifleman all three cards. Maxed. Tank killer. Maxed. Tormentor from luck if possible. If you Wana feel like zeus with his thunderbolt. Go into agility. Take all the pistol perks and max then. And get the perk that increases ranged sneak attacks. Make you a pipe bolt action rifle or find a legendary one. I recommend instigating 😉 it benefits from both. Pitsol and rifle perks. At least for now.  It's possible to hit for 900+ with a sneak critical with one of them . Get an adrenal reaction serum and rad up and the number gets silly fast. 
---
You may well be correct about addiction having a part in those that play games for hundreds of hours, it's is still better than drink, drugs or alcohol, if you balance playing with a little exercise if you are able, I think it is not really a problem.
---
I always keep the basement window open for some fresh air, otherwise my Mom starts complaining about the smell.
---
I'm 165, neither have I. 
---
Also hardened receivers. Good mod increase dmg the most. 
---
Nah fuck the bounty. Lol! Your a hero it be an honor to clear your name haha
---
I highly doubt they had a really good build.
---
Availing was incredibly broken.
---
I lost my mistress of mystery gear :(
---
I don't think I can ever get it back.
---
they should remove it altogether, nerfing it again is harsh, it says two shot that should mean two shots, at least one more shot at base damage, if they nerf it again what is the point of calling it two shot.
---
&gt; it's clear that they are not supporting the best servers
---
What does that mean?  Their "servers" are AWS instances, it is extremely unlikely they have hardware problems.
---
One of the best answers I have ever seen. In my case I am on dialysis 3 days a week for 5 hours each time and I can't work because of it. I use gaming as an escape and have met some genuinely amazing people to speak to over the years that has helped me. 
---
Balance - out the window?
---
&gt;WE. ARE. LEGION
---
That may be so but I damn well keep forgetting, I make notes but forget where I put them  ☹️ 
---
That little town Lewisburg, I think that's  the name, on a stall. 
---
Just kill scorchbeasts, it's the easy way to go.
---
So I will hang on to it then. Thanks for the replies. 
---
He could have if he knew what he was doing .
---
Too bad the standard pull up an old save deal won't work :(
---
Perhaps it’s the office for Supermutant counselling, he just wants to listen to your problems 
---
Hunting rifle is a low levels best friend. Aim for face and down they go. And nearly every lower level enemy you meet drops one and ammo. Shotguns also. Just use whatever weapon you are seeing the most ammo for. The auto pipe guns are not so forgiving eats up ammo rather fast. If ya melee. Baseball bat.... Can make cheap and scrap for mods. Pit on the highest dmg one and go experience what negan feels. 
---
Nice one! I camp in the hills to the north of whitespring and I witness nuke impacts quite often right from my living room -)) Here are some of my screens: [https://imgur.com/a/kk72rFh](https://imgur.com/a/kk72rFh)
---
And all I do is farm plastic and smash squirrels with my super sledge :)
---
You didn't read the post.  I can do it by myself.  the tag teaming is for ease of respawning the enemies.
---
And all the nuked flora you don't have enough stuff to stabilise, especially if you have green thumb.
---
The only hard part is finding buyers before it expires.
---
I read most of it then some customers came and put me off lol that's why I deleted my comment after I read it fully 
---
Then ignore the part about true attachements. Was just a little extra since I didn't know if it was vats build or not. Hair trigger is nice w/o vats aswell.
---
The explosions are bugged, they do little damage on a direct hit but more if they explode near the enemy but not on them, same with rocket launchers.
---
But were there enough enemies to get your mass and fluids?
---
Ia! Ia!
---
I'm doing the same. Checking reddit and reading patch notes every now and then, to see if they improved it up to the point i'm willing to try again
---
Awesome story! It was fun to read! That’s why I love this game! 
---
I feel like when i tested 5 fuel it lasted less than a second lol 
---
All the best to, enjoy the wastes :)
---
...This is a novel concept, but it assumes a reasonably fixed price for things. Sometimes shit goes for a fair percentage lower or higher as a matter of course, due to increased supply or demand. That's...how money works. 
---
you can open them with a switch
---
Yes. Sometimes they are there because someone is doing the mayor for a day quest, other times they are just there. It is fairly close to a couple fissure sites so it isn't that unusual.
---
Sometimes they are neutral to players sometimes not. But any time I see them they are battling with the robots. 
---
If they are hostile then I join in the fight. If not I often just wait and watch. Then get bored and decide to put the poor beast out of its misery. Either way it's a good opportunity to maybe get some decent loot - I got bos paint plans off it once. And at the least I get some food.
---
Not as long as Camps are build in the golf club please

Use this boi
---
Not even close. You have to have it ready to go before you drop.  I generally have a decent stock from when WS gets hit. 
---
I hated the plasma gatling DMG  and ive had a pyrolyzer since super early but fuel is crazy inefficient, i think you just gave me a whole new angle
---
Powered doors with a code on the outside so players can come in, but mobs can't. Pressure plate on the inside which will automatically close it when they leave.
---
&gt; was really wondering if the piercing mag or stinging mag is worth it.
---
Very much.  I go with perforating myself.
---
He'll need the mini fusion generator mod from Fallout 4 Nexus, available at all good chandlers.
---
I gathered fuel for about 25 levels, it got me once use against a standard ghoul mob lmao 
---
A little trick for the grind at lower levels:
---
Go to the tennis court and draw the mobs out of the golf club through the front door. The chain link fence will keep them at bay while you guys take them out. Just kite them back and forth so they can't get through the door. 
---
Also, when you're pulling from the cabins, try using the space between the cabins as your choke point, pulling them back behind the cabins and blowing them up when they're concentrated in the little alleys. 
---
Be careful around the maintenance building as an explosive build. The occasional robot butler will show up, causing the entire place to go hostile on you. 
---
Hope this helps!
---
Hahaha I have done that myself.
---
Turned up with a lvl 12 toon looking for the fabled Unruly Golfers, the spawn scaled with the prevalent 100+ people in the general vicinity.
---
First charred slapped me for 80 rad damage, I tuned 180 and kept advancing... towards the resort entrance shouting 'sentreeeeeeeee, iiiincomiiiiing'. 
---
Jammy bastard.
---
I mean...no. A salt mine? Sure. Distilling salt from fresh water? No, this isn't reasonable. Radiation doesn't make shit more salty. 
---
Spices That could be "spices". Possible ancestor of firecracker berries, why not. 
---
Pepper? No. That's flat out not native to the Americas, and you won't find it here. 
---
Sugar makes sense, because you can make sugar from a wide number of plants.
---
I do agree on the carry weight, though...your average salt shaker weighs less than a pound and has enough salt for many, many meals. 
---
Because of griefers, they never change.
---
The internet says Uranium Fever...however, I ran Uranium Fever 200+ plus times and nothing. I got 3rd tier plan from Mr.Messenger in Savage Divide and 4th tier from Mr.Messenger in the Forest Region. Also took over 100 events by my estimates to drop those... 
---
Lightweight :D I'm normally at 700/205 :D
---
Yep, ive had to run back to gate when things get too dicey, and let the bots do their thing.  “The Whitespring is under OUR protection”, as the assaultron says, lol.  
---
Wait until you zone into the station and a Scorchbeast or two is attacking the gate or bunker robots.  I run a stealth sniper build, but have a Black Dragon.  I watched the battle for a while, then popped into my PA, grabbed my trusty Black Dragon, and joined the fray (but from a distance, lol).  
---
After the beast was dispatched and looted, I strolled around and observed the carnage.  One of the assaultron legs were busted, it was pulling it’s smoking frame by it’s arms along its normal route, saying “Sir” and shit.  A sentry bot was lumbering along, damaged and smoking.  IIRC there were other robots “dead” here and there.
---
 Disturbing.
---
Can’t wait until it happens again.
---
They don't have *your* life maybe, but they do have a life. When you get older you'll understand and hopefully develop some empathy.
---
Yesssssss
---
I think you can get the garb back. I see the tattered dress pop up. I’m unsure about the veil the gun and the orb.
---
Maybe it will let you redo the quests?
---
I'm going to have to look for it. Thanks
---
grab a friend the first time 😉
---
I didn't even know that was a thing. I also bought the power armour edition. Bethesda...
---
Here is my rifle build:

---
Im sure there is room for improvements, but it will get the job done most of the time. 
---
I seldom use power armor, though. I find it is not needed except in nuke zones. When ever I go into one I use the T60 PA as its very easy to maintain. 
---
Use the handmade rifle and be sure to mod it to max. You will need to get the plans and craft and scrap a bunch of rifles. Hardened receiver and armor penetrating magazine is the most important. Also mod for accuracy. 
---
Handmade is ammo intensive, so get ammosmith and superduper perks and craft that ammo yourself. 
---
Marsupial and Speed Demon so you can run and jump up onto roofs.
---
&gt; There's nothing challenging about acquiring it - you just have to stand there shooting over and over again.
---
All 3 cards I have so far (not yet tried a launch) I got because NPC's shot down the cargo bot for me.  Once the Super Mutants at Pleasant Valley, twice the robots at Watoga.
---
Lol it's no big.
---
Thanks! I'll check it out!
---
VATS also can't lock on if you're crouched. That's really all he had to do to cut you down, he just had no idea what he was doing
---
Because I don't want you anywhere near my camp.
---
How about you leave your front door open tonight, someone might just want some food, or a nap on your couch. 
---
Really? Wow
---
I was at 1085/250,  this is how far I've managed to get it down after two days of selling stuff.
---
Going over 1000 is a *serious* drag.
---
You should be able to use any fuel for flamers, oil cans, handy fuel, shortening. Anything that generates oil when scrapped.
---
This is the best advice in this thread. You need a low number of high level players with high  damage builds. I'm not saying that's how it should be, but with the current state of this event that's how it is.
---
Genuinely interested: what has made you to decide to buy it now (and not earlier for example)?
---
What platform are you on? I never had anyone destroy my camp in about 250 hours. You could opt to place it in a secluded area, with the downside that if you want to build a trade post, it won’t be very busy. On the other hand you could build your camp into a nice ‘refuelling’ station for explorers who need a rest!
---
Yeah flatwoods monster.
---
When I first started I built my camp next to copper resources. That thing would show up daily to farm.
---
Wasn’t sure what to make of it, till that a SB and scorched all came at me near top of the world.
---
It's all--or nearly all--trash cans.
---
Should I give you a flamer and a molotov?
---
u/vuedue
---
Great story, enjoyed it with my morning coffee :)
---
I’m sure you are just trying to be helpful, but that is posted like every day here. I think everyone is already using it.
---
Do it with someone you trust - not someone who's just going to up and leave you for a Whitespring run. Try and find someone around the same level as you as well.
---
I saw a 130+ grooming a 40 that was clearly just in it for the loot. 
---
Bloody mess (luck) and Adrenaline (Agility). 
---
Yeah I seen about adrenaline was thinking about going into that next rank, what’s bloody mess ?
---
I hope this is real and he has more than 200 caps! Anyone else reminded of a certain mudcrab merchant?
---
I was a level 70 when I launched my first one with my bf that was a level 35 
---
While that’s true in a way, I believe it depends on perception and agility stats of the players .
---
Adds on 5% damage with any weapon per rank (3 ranks) and also gives you a chance to make enemies fall to pieces, very fun perk. 
---
I have noticed that with rocket launchers doing miniscule damage but loads if blown next to/behind enemies. 
---
Nice thanks for the tips man
---
He sold me two death claw hands...  and then bled to death after it turned out he cut off and sold his own hands. Such a noble sacrifice. Always remember deathmerchant-bro.
---
Exactly, it should do more damage on direct hit not less.
---
you missed several location like the crashed space station
---
I have a keypad door with the code posted on the bottom left of the entrance for anyone with a high enough perception ;) 
---
It would make sense that way, but some of my team are unyielding rifleman builds with 30+ perception. Even taking a Berry mentat doesn’t give you lock on if they’re crouched. 
---
Is there ammon for syringe? All I've seen/been able to craft is just syringes. Can you make the bloat fly syringes and what not? 
---
It's boring and a bit tedious. My DPS is maxed out and it still takes 15 minutes for me. Now imagine doing it 3 times in a row to triple-nuke Whitesprings! Also you don't have to re-enter the code for a week in the same silo so what's the point of decoding anyway. I think, seeing nukacrypt, that this was a missed opportunity by Bethesda: a phone app that after a short mini-game, gives you the code for the week and silo.
---
A few tips:
---
* Bring Vampiric weapons, saves a lot of stimpaks.
---
* Anti-armor perks/magazines recommended.
---
* Deal with the turrets first.
---
* Aim for the arms/thrusters.
---
* You can keep and repair the broken Mainframe Cores outside the silo. Bring a fresh set next time to save 2-5 minutes.
---
* Swipe the nuke card first, then go back and repair your weapons/armor. I usually take off the Gunsmith perk card so once I'm done with the silo, I can repair the gun back to 200% just before launching.
---
He was my only merchant!  Lol, my recall spell always took me there.
---
My C.A.M.P. is the same way. All the crafting stations, a common room and a guest room are on the ground floor and are readily accessible to anyone stopping by, but my character's bedroom on the upper floor is locked for privacy.
---
It works differently in fo76 than it did in fo4. In fo76, you mod your syringer with a specific barrel, which gives the fired syringes a certain effect. So you only need blank syringes as ammo.
---
But the official description of the chameleon armour effect is that is makes you invisible to vats. Which already required crouching. So if everyone can be invisible to vats while crouching in any armour isn’t that armour useless? I don’t doubt that Bethesda would make that mistake, it just seems odd.
---
You can have a switch that toggles the pressure plates power on/off so that a player could enable the plate and then it'll open/close. Odds are they don't disable it on the way out though.
---
The other thing to think about though is what are the chances a mob goes to the pressure plate first when attacking? They don't seem to have very complex priorities with what they attack, so probably they just go to a wall to attack. Either defenses will then get them or they eat through the wall and are in anyways.
---
I think the last 2 stars are for a mod and a paint. (btw., 3\* is rare and I don't know if there is a atomic skin for a weapon that can get either the blade mod or scorched killer).
---
If you get all 18 mutations, is there a way to keep the ones you want? Or do you just have to get lucky when using radaways?
---
I go in power armor, melee weapon, and hack terminals. I do it alone and it’s too easy tbh. Barely use stims. 
---
Ohhh, come to think of it I've never thought about modding a syringer, only for that daily you seem to ever get once, the Vox one, I love that quest. 
---
Explosive aoe damage ignores armor, direct hits deal direct damage and are reduced by armor.
---
Funny story, say a lvl49 in a silo by himself and said "cool looks like we might get a nuke tonight" but nothing was happening (afteer 10 or so mins)  so my team of 3 went to go help him. We found him still in reactor room so we lead him all the way to the launch room. Told him he could launch since he was there first so he put his key card and then does nothing, we point, shoot bash the key pad  and tell him in area chat to enter the code but he then spends the next 5 minutes running around the silo as if looking for something.
---
Eventually we give up enter our own code and launch on WS, having checked the map to see if there were enough high levels to take on the queen. I was in my lvl 50 alt and havent been in a blast zone for a while now and I could not believe how many ghouls were spawning, was some intense fun.
---
It's kinda hard to free aim at people with chameleon, so it's def additive value. PvP is essentially all about counters - a really big rock, paper, scissors match. If they're a VATS dependent build, you crouch. The counter is to hip fire with something that has a high rate of fire or area of effect like explosives. The counter to that is to get chameleon armor/stealth boys. The counter to that is to take a berry mentat. The counter to that is... you get the point. 
---
It's pretty well thought out and like most aspects of the game it encourages you to team up. In teams, you have a diverse enough set of "counters" to take anyone down. 
---
*cough*Atom Shop*cough*
---
Yeah I can’t even click back into it to reinstall my stuff.
---
Caesar's legion is a curse, but I had faith on The Courier all the time.
---
But....but...you wouldn’t be able to see....
---
Solid, must have perks, both of them. They wont come online before the later levels, though. Tank killer and concentrated fire are both good, if you dont have them. Both under perception. Gun Fu is another good perk, but late level as well. There are several perks under Luck to help with VATS and criticla hits. Better Critical, Four Leaf Clover, Grim Reapers Sprint. These will help you keep VTS up and deal a lot of devestating criticals. 
---
I guess it just doesn't work. I'd help if knew how. Sorry.
---
All good.
---
But why does the chameleon armour description say that it protects you from vats if every armour crouched does the same thing anyway. I can get it. It’s just doesn’t make sense.
---
It's not your traditional FPS game, so it probably shouldn't play like one. It's centered around how effectively you build your character. Being high level is sometimes a hindrance in PvP, completely different from PvE. 
---
Ah :o is it a bug? It better be because that makes no sense.
---
Why does a troubleshooter's gamma gun say it'll do 30% more damage to robots when robots are immune to rad damage? Fallout logic
---
Scorched Earth is great for getting revives. Just have to hope people actually use the emote to get help rather than die in silence because sometimes jerks stalk nuke zones looking to steal paper bags off dead bodies.
---
Wait when you know the code from online sites you don't need to grind the code pieces to be able to get down there and launch the nuke? You can just get in shove the code in even without any of the code pieces? Just the nuclear keycard?
---
The last two or three fights I went to failed as well..and on the the nukes that have dropped since..I wouldn't see The SQB reign has ended! So they were fails and I know I made the right decision that I didn't go and waste my resources. Sad. I got to do 1 SQB fight where she was killed before the update that ruined it and it was so much fun. Hope they fix it. I am on the I am become death but I am waiting to drop my first nuke. 
---
That sounds more like an unintentional legendary modifier going on a gun it’s not supposed to. But I see your point.
---
What the error say if it say account unauthorized or something Like that you may be suspended
---
Yeah, it's awesome \^\^
---
I played 6 fallouts.
---
**Fallout 1**: It was okay, but I'm not a big fan of turn based combat.
---
**Fallout 2**: Gave up in New Reno after 15 hours. I followed a guide till then and the possibilities just exploded after this point.
---
**Fallout 3**: It was great at the time. Looking back, the aestethic was too gray and the gunplay was too much miss.
---
**Fallout New Vegas**: It was exceptional at the time. The guns, modding, story, choices, options were fantastic. Looking back, too yellow and the gunplay was still too much miss.
---
**Fallout 4**: It was an enjoyable action/shooter. Perks, modding were great, gunplay finally works, nice visual change. Story, choices were somewhat limited/simplistic - I didn't care about that and didn't hinder me either.
---
**Fallout 76**:
---
Good:
---
* Visuals are stunning, lush, varying.
---
* Co-op events
---
* Exploration
---
* Gunplay
---
* Modding
---
So-so:
---
* No human NPCs
---
* No dialog/story choices
---
* Perk cards
---
* Content
---
* Enemies
---
Bad:
---
* Bugs
---
* Glitches
---
* Crashes
---
* Hangs
---
Ugly:
---
* Story
---
* Loot drops
---
* Grind
---
* Stash limit
---
* Carryweight
---
* PvP
---
Best game for me so far: **Fallout 76**, would not go back to any of the previous.
---
I agree. Just got off leveling my heavy guns guy and went back to my rifle guy I made at release to finally start grinding for legendaries. Went up about 30 levels the past week, 15 of them possibly being off of Westech alone. I've still yet to get any two shot or explosives, but I've enough caps to just buy my own off the trading reddits XD.
---
Any specific armor needs worn?
---
It worked! +karma
---
I get what you're saying, I'm just telling you what I experience when I do PvP. It's a bit more nuanced than that, but that's how it works. If you initiate VATS before they crouch then you can maintain the lock, but all that takes to counter is to break line of sight and re-emerge crouched. I'm not sure how it works with stealth boys when VATS is locked on before, but if it's anything like assaultron I imagine hit chance drops to 0%
---
A lot of games that aren't FPS have balances. Even those with guys of different stats are separate by in game mechanics like leveled servers. All PvP games where you hit someone twice you'll see people call griefing. Make it actually take skill and then it'll be fun (mostly everyone can say FO76 PvP is not fun)
---
Legendary drops are definitely popping off at the tail end of nuke zones. I've experienced this dozens of times at Whitespring. Not *good* drops, but plentiful for sure. Many of the ghouls won't be listed as legendary but drop legendaries no less.
---
As long as your house isn't a turret base at the golf club I'm going need with this. 
---
There hasn't been any updates since it broke, so probably not. Some people said there are ways to get it working, but not sure if it's 100% yet. Type adrenal in the search bar at the top, and you will see hundreds of topics on the issues. You can find some answers there
---
Safe zones in survival mode are not good game design and defeat the entire point behind it. However, if you want to feel "safe" don't play survival. No safe zones forces people to group/clan up for safety and to fight for the worthwhile resources. We should be fighting for control of White Springs, not having fashion shows under the warm red glow of daddy sentry bots caring gaze.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm all for putting it in adventure mode. People who don't want to PVP shouldn't be forced into it. I think changing pacifist mode so that you and your CAMP take no damage so you can play the game in peace is just fine. Just don't bring that to survival. I want consequences (dropped items other than junk) and a better mechanism to group up.
---
p.s. Salty Care Bears ask for duels.
---
As a level 126 15 luck char, I disagree.
---
Thanks. I’ll never do a ton of pvp I just like to know the rules of how the game works. The description of perception also talks about how it effects your ability to detect stealthy movement. Sounds like it does shit all, at least in PvP.
---
It's got more long term strategy than other games. Being higher level doesn't really mean you're more powerful. If you PvP in this game, you'll understand pretty quickly that levels mean nothing after 70. Anyone below 50 probably doesn't stand a chance, but after 70 everyone's on the same level. After that, it's just a matter of who's chosen a better build
---
Thank you for your kind offer. Alas, I'm PS4.
---
There was a guy this weekend who deleted his mutations, got a new Adrenal Reaction, only to find it bugged again the next day.
---
One of my favorite things to do is try to figure out a way past the locked doors into the house. Work benches, beds, chairs whatever
---
Are you sure you did not get the mod rather than the plan? 
---
Is it sitting in your stash?
---
I found the electro fusion mod about a month ago. And it will not let me attach it. Its not resource heavy building a lvl 50 hatchet, but without the mod attached, I never use it.
---
I think that refers to whether players are marked on your compass when stealth. I think with higher perception you also see the red arrow over their character at a farther distance. My character has 1 perception and I always start engagements by eating wolf ribs (2 PER) and taking psychotats (2-3 PER?) to boost my perception. It's still pretty important. I think the max spotting distance on compass you get is 100 meters or so.
---
No, at least right now. I have a Anti-armor Prime .50 Cal and was useless against the SBQ. 
---
However, my 2\* Vampiric Gatling Gun (+10% damage when aiming) + 3x3 heavy gunner, Stabilized 3, Bloody mess 3 deals 132 dmg/shot. I can tank the SBQ point blank range and I barely require stimpaks. (This doesn't mean always win as the number of players have an effect, so half the time I fail even with this. At least it has visible effect on her health.)
---
It seems many of the Nuka Crypt code solvers were banned. So expect codes to be solved by Wednesday for now anyway.
---
what's rule 6
---
Lol, yup
---
Same. Haven't been able to kill a single SBQ since the most recent patch. Well no, that's not entirely true, was able to kill one yesterday because she bugged and didn't take off after we failed Scorched Earth.
---
It would work with MANT design suggestion, but not with this design. The whole Medic role people are trying to do in current F76 is like trying do dig a pool with cool spoon, because you like that spoon, but it is totally useless. Because players are running with big f#cking stacks of Stimpacks. End days of F76, I didn't even pick up anything below Super Stimpacks and if I did, I took them for selling to vendors. 
---
Thanks guys I’ll hold off
---
Thanks don’t sound good
---
I thought the same thing yeah, it's meant to be a human with the deathclaw nearby which killed him, but they accidentally set the model to deathclaw also.
---
Thanks man. Theses days it can be hard to just simply discuss the game on this sub. One last thing you can probably answer...how does the game determine sneak multipliers in PvP?
---
Yep. Been there a few times myself, got easily overencumbered during a white spring farm. Once I'd crawled to the vendors, all my legendaries were trash, wasn't worth the hassle.
---
I hope there is some change to the CAMP budgets, I've just set up a new build, albeit it is quite a large shell I only have the small quest tower minimally furnished and the entrainment floor of the main building.
---
The rest is barren which is quite upsetting after the time it took me to find a plot of the necessary size and level ground. I've locked all the doors to the vast empty rooms in the mean time. I only have 4 lights, a generator and 8 planets outside of static decorations and workbenches :(
---
At that lvl its nothing but 2 shots/hits and its over.  No strategy, no skill. I'm not nocking this gear system its just not a popular choose with most people. LoL has this and you don't get wiped unless you are crap. You can have all unyielding, TSE, blah blah and still get smacked because someone got lucky enough to get their hits in. Again not nocking it down, just isn't fun to make a small mistake or slightly unprepapared and loose my workshop and caps for it
---
I haven't seen any nukes dropped, but I'm on PS4 and I usually see about a dozen players on a map. I like the PVP in this game because no-one has a truly unfair advantage and you can flee if it goes south. So far my killed/got killed ratio is about even. I killed a couple of people and they respawned and killed me back.
---
That's a bit more tricky and I think it's line of sight and direction a player is facing. I've def gotten sneak ranged attacks, but never any sneak melee attacks. AFAIK, the multipliers are still the same. 
---
Look at picture 3. Know what would be awesome there? a cash register on the bar, also, a pitcher on the counter. Some bottles on the wall. An actual counter instead of a bookshelf. So many little things it would be nice to have. At least with the update you should be able to place bottles and stuff. 
---
Just  do a quick Alt run and do order of mysteries again then transfer to your existing character.
---
So I've heard there are other flavours than the regular, cherry and quantum I've been finding only. Where/how do you go about getting the different ones?
---
Did you forget this is the apocalypse?
---
You arnt supposed to be safe. 
---
Hi there! I reapplied the AR serum and it's now working just fine. I removed all of my mutations reapplied them except for Adrenal waited the hour for them to settle and then reapplied Adrenal. 
---
 Pip-boy only shows the -12HP however it is working and reacting to HP changes.
---
One thing: If you die things might freak out but if you log out and back in it's fine. It happened once to me since reapplying.
---
I hope this helps :)
---
If you on PS4 I have a lvl 10 instigating black powder pistol...which will see you till level 30 
---
Endanger is good against SBQ. Same with cryolater.
---
Interesting.... I made a post asking if there are any sales going on and feedback from other players on how this game is.... got flagged and removed, meanwhile this post is perfectly fine. 
---
Every build has a counter that destroys it. Playing PvP solo is pretty boring, but playing in teams (the way I think it was originally thought out) is pretty interesting. If you're prepared and adaptive enough, you can learn figure out how to make a 1 shot fight into sustaining 8 or more shots until you die, but it does go back to the idea of build choices having consequences. You can pivot sometimes and switch a card or two to really change the fight's dynamic, but really only if you haven't built your character into a corner. Chances are if you haven't built your character for PvP you're just going to die in one shot, do no damage to other players, and there's no way around it. 
---
It’s working fine. Refreshed my Adrenal Reaction 4-5 days ago and haven’t had problems with it since.
---
Exactly this thank you!
---
People act like the insane damage output builds are broken, but they require immense setup and dedication to play. If you dont pay attention for a few seconds, you're dead to a random rad thing you missed. Got swarmed and forgot to keep your AP in check? You may die.
---
These builds are realistically only good for the SBQ. Everywhere else the damage is not even close to necessary. Which then becomes the problem, since it takes ludicrous gear levels and then keeping rads at 20%. Its a huge amount of investment to play and get this gear, but its really only good on the SBQ. So I'm seeing less and less of them around, meaning less queen kills.
---
I'm level 20 . No ones even had the discussion with me about nukes yet.... where do I even put it ? 
---
I don't play this game, I don't know what half the things you said are
---
But damn.
---
Was that a story.
---
Watoga. 
---
It’s just a random encounter, I’ve seen him many many times and he has never been alive :(
---
Codes reset Monday at 7pm EST
---
Whisky is also 6 STR with the right cards and you can buy 1-3 a time from the bar tender
---
Here are my thoughts based on your post: 
---
* Awareness must be a visual glitch. It still works for me. I've also noticed that my friend who has a weapon with resist while aiming would randomly gain 50 armor while not even aiming. Could be server lag. 
---
* She's not more resistant in the air but rather there is damage drop off. Possibly more drop off from vertical distance compared to horizontal distance. Not confirmed though. 
---
* Interesting of you to think enemies add to her scaling. That would mean 55,000 hp per enemy. I don't think thats the case though. 
---
* There is no armor cap. However 90% is about the soft-cap with melee. 75% Incisor applied first, 12.5% due to remainder with Anti-Armor, then melee mod is about 2-5% of the remaining 12.5%. Which is why its about 90% total. 
---
* She does a weird jump/take-off glitch. Sometimes she wants to be on melee but something in her code is triggering her to immediately fly again. Even when she is playing her melee animations. 
---
* There is a down time of like 1-2 minutes after the event ends where she finally figures out she has to leave. I've almost killed her before because she landed the second the even ended, giving us an extra 30 seconds to kill her. 
---
* Her logic is messed up after the sonic barrage changes thats forsure. Constant carpet bombs and summoning of add's. I personally have started using the event as an exp farm rather then killing her. 
---
I'm pretty sure she is just scaling to 1,220,000 hp. Which would mean its very hard to see her health even make a dent with a full clip of an anti-armor heavy weapon. If other players don't pull their weight and by-ass a majority of her armor you can really tell. 
---
There's some cap stashes and an reference to *The Shining* but that's about it
---
So the unicorn exists
---
Yes, the turrets are usually gone but the silo is then filled with lvl 50+ Gutsies and 46 Assaultrons, even the starting area. In addition, when reaching the launch room again, there are usually 2 Assaultrons, 5 Gutsies and 3 Protectrons waiting in the room just after the stairs. Annoying.
---
This. I wear these two as an outfit and the hands glitch through the gloves in first person.
---
It’s working fine if you remove then reapply.  The positive effect just doesn’t show up on the pip boy.
---
To be fair, he probably doesnt understand much at all 
---
Client-Server desync, happened to me a couple of times since Patch 5. The mob died on the server but your client thinks it is still alive. Any damage dealt to it is not confirmed by the server thus it is reset on the client. No sure workaround, just leave the area, fast travel far away once you can and come back a minute or so.
---
My explosive shotgun ignores shotgun perks when in power armor.With Regular and two shot everything works fine
---
I have a tent. No doors. No ratties eating my furniture away either. As I've figured the directions enemies come from in my camp. All it takes is a good defense and wammo. No more locked doors required.
---
I've never seen him alive, myself. I was playing with a guy who claimed to see him die from a distance - saw a fight with a Deathclaw and some super mutants go down and when we got over there everybody was dead. I didn't witness the first part and can't be sure that dude wasn't fucking with me, but I figured it might be worth mentioning so long as I was clear about the potentially shaky source on it.
---
I'm really really hoping it's actually possible to find it alive. If not now, maybe later after some update.
---
[I've had a similar experience and a similar thought upon seeing it.](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/av42mq/sometimes_even_a_super_mutant_feels_the_need_to/) 
---
&gt; Under the now-in-effect 21st Century Communications and Video  Accessibility Act (CVAA), games released after Jan. 1, 2019, must  include chat functionality that is accessible for people with  disabilities, lest their developers face fines.  
---
This new act was going through last year and looked was planned to go into effect around October 2018 but was delayed this is why Fallout 76 does not have chat due to the add cost this new act adds now...
---
Yep. So long as your camp doesn't repeatedly attack another player it's always in Pacifist mode!
---
these vendors are fucking shit
---
How would you beat that build in PvP? Avoid damage and keep distance use fully automatic bloodied Exp, or Anti armour exp, and or counter with own bloodied build, I notice bloodieds have low health so always a glass cannon vs the right sort of build. High damage resistance be super important vs bloodied, also speed and agi as you have to be quick to avoid them, and need agi for AP when fighting them. 
---
I think I now know where the confusion between us comes from. You think I am yet another PvE person who thinks they have the best idea on how PvP should look and I see so many nonsense ideas coming out of these guys that I understand this frustration. Hear me out, because my greatest sorrow with this game is lack of open PvP.
---
I don't want to shield myself from the chaos. I want to increase player density to have more interesting encounters. I am as PvP oriented as it gets, and I am completely prepared in every regard to dominate once survival servers are out. I spent more hours testing weapons against godlike powerbuilds than I spent farming.
---
Thousands of hours I put in this type of games indicate that having a spot thats relatively safe surrounded by chaos is a way to increase player density in a specific region thus increasing the overall amount of exchanged violence. I don't suggest buffing these bots so they could defend me. I want it to be demanding task to actually raid the place. In all these hours actively seeking PvP I am yet to find a group that would not be a source of caps for my pack. I don't want survival servers to be a playground where I can do what I want wherever I want. I want less prepared players to actually have a chance to join up and populate survival servers, because without exposure to properly built characters in a world where they actually are able to live for a five minutes, majority will never learn, and without a steady playerbase of people who know how to hold a gun and how to build a character, the survival servers will never achieve their full potential.
---
I like saving my regular stimpacks for reviving players. I keep 100+ diluted at all times. I just press the stimpack button more a few times if I'm low health. If they changed this I'd run out of regular stimpacks too quickly.
---
Same as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5: there is no Fallout 76 sub.
---
What platform do you play on?
---
I have personally done this and it works
---
Thanks. Some people like to make it seem like it's not that difficult. While not hard, it does require constant attention. I run bloodied 24/7. My health has not been above 30% in probably 2 weeks.  Balancing rads, particularly in nuke zones, is a delicate dance between dilute radaway and ionized meat/toxic water.
---
Where most people get tripped up, and where I had difficult at first, was maintaining that balance. It was easy for it to get out of whack and requires you to be ever vigilant. Sure, I'm tanky AF, but that's because I've only got 25 hp.  I have to be or I'd constantly be dying.  It's not for everyone, but the reward is well worth the aggravation. 
---
I lock my door because I don't want mobs coming in and wrecking my shit. But if I'm there and you want in, I'll open the door and let you in and even offer you a Nuka-Cola because I'm cool like that. I don't lock outside structures, though, feel free to take stuff like ore and water.
---
What the hell, they kept that quiet. Conisdering that I have been following all news around the launch of Fallout 76 how did this slip past me. I want this now!
---
Remind me to attack your CAMP if I ever find it.
---
Killing bloodied is easy. Killing bloodied in sentinel assassin is hard. Trick is to use a rapid firing weapon with perk cards to stagger them.
---
Go play Fallout 4. I can’t wait until they expand pvp. I have killed and been killed. I have taken junk and had junk taken. The best parts of this game are pvp. 
---
I did my first one today level 88 solo.
---
I was extremely nervous but it turned out to be a cake walk in x-01 power armor.
---
Then why does the game have a 'Passive Mode' setting, makes no real sense does it :)
---
Base stats are indicative of heavy or sturdy,  try a google search anything with fo4 will still be valid 
---
I wouldn't blame Bethesda too quickly. Could have been a theme specially made by Sony to promote the game on their platform.
---
I definitely didn’t buy it since I run a sniper build. I want to say it was a random drop from an event, but good to know where to buy. Thx
---
This happens a lot in Harper's Ferry, but only to 1\* super mutants. The 2-3\* fight properly. Sometimes I see other types of 1\* legendary enemies run away, but since they don't speak, I can't know for sure.
---
I got a Tri Barrel Mini gun plan off a Scorched Boss yesterday
---
Only happened once pre-nerf, but I was swarmed with legendaries in Alpha running solo. My party heard me swearing the entire time because I was overwhelmed by legendary assaultrons during launch and ran into a 3 star legendary sentry bot leading to the launch.
---
oh cool, thanks! Can i use FO4 stats to comprehend any item that is present in both games? that would help me a bunch cuz there’s not exactly a 76 KB out there yet.
---
I got electro fusion after completing the teapot the second time.
---
Actually I think it was more than 3 now I think about it. I saw Morgantown first, 1 or 2 on prime (I joined those servers after queen went down sadly) and at least one on Whitesprings.
---
I didn't realise I was so lucky!
---
Thanks
---
Congrats :)
---
Great thanks
---
Chill out my man. Not sure what conversation you are part of dude.
---
I have never said "who cares" or "I don't care."
---
You are overreacting like one of those hardcore liberals who freak out if others have a different opinion than them. 
---
I simply gave my opinion and you got your panties all bunched up over it. 
---
I still want my trading machine to appear on the map for everyone to see. It has nothing to do with laziness. My base is in a spot with minor foot traffic. But I want more.
---
Oh, about your 'logic'.
---
You don't want me to have an option to make my vending machine appear on the map due to griefers. Yet you suggest moving to a heavily populated area where there's lots of foot traffic.
---
Is that like having a gun-free zone in schools?
---
Ps. Don't get so bent out of shape when somebody else has a different opinion than you. It's going to happen a lot in your lifetime, get used to it.
---
Is there any videos of these turret bases? I've not seen one yet lol
---
Big Bend Tunnel in the room with the office pods and locked doors on the ground level in the dark against a wall.

Please do, I love watching cunts act like petulant children.
---
PSN: FahtEnn
---
Yea, aparently what you just said is what you gotta say lol
---
Passive mode is so you personally don't hurt another player. It's never done anything to protect you. Personally, I have no idea why people would voluntarily turn off their ability to turn off their ability to deal with any threat, much less the only threat with things like free thought and legendary gear. 
---
Sorry to dig up such an old thread, but I wanted to say that this is still happening. Made me angry because I had some great pics from day one onwards. That’s a lot of game memories lost for no explained reason
---
I’ll make a new post about this in case nobody reads this due to the threads age.
---
Im level 135 and level 37 on my alt. Never launched a nuke either. I've had a steady keycard for while, but its not felt right. Yet. We could.. do it togehter.. you and me? Maybe go on a few farming trips to Whitesprings first. Get to know and trust eachother. If it feels right. I promise not to be gentle (to the robots) but I will defo stick around afterwards. 
---
Usually don't have to as much as you would think but I've had to a couple of times.  But thanks!
---
The new survival mode will be for people like you. The person that made this post won’t have to deal with “survival mode” so maybe you can go play that instead :) 
---
There are allot of people paying it forward in the game always nice to hear.
---
sounds familiar.  
---
  Thats why I have 2 unused strength points and no cards for them.
---
*trips on first modestly sized rock, breaks neck, dies*
---
Exactly my first thought. Smash those camps.
---
I love this so much
---
I have my different versions of chems keyed to the wheel.  Each one has their own assigned number.  
---
Great read! And thanks for sharing.
---
I've been having this issue since BETA
---
Yeah my thoughts exactly.  Just waiting on the update to see what I'll be able to put down!
---
26% water
---
When you claim a workshop a message pops up saying if someone else tries to claim you get put into PvP immediately. So you can’t become wanted killing someone else for a workshop
---
Two shot Explosive

Two Shot Explosive

Would you please stop with your common sense logic already? 
---
Damn! This mutation system really seems to be a hot mess.
---
I personally wish that my *Healing Factor: +300% health regeneration, -55% chem effects* would do something, anything, it seems so totally random. I'm always using stimpacks, at least I got that one sitting in a hot green puddle. 
---
God I feel stupid 
---
this issue has been around since day 1.
---
if this helps you- server hop and take this workshop first if u plan to takeover others. usually just one hop does the trick. 
---
sometimes, thought VERY rarely I have been able to get the enemies to appear by hitting them with the butt of a rifle. this only seems to work if their sound files play (ie. they breathe and make vocal noises etc). 
---
I agree, ionized meat is pretty useless right now besides for the carnivore mutation
---
I hope you wouldn't be so quick to abandon your gf in real life. Lol
---
Yep, I will admit I absolutely thought that about you and after reading this I realize we're on the same page. I agree that encouraging new players to try PVP will help. The bots at White Springs don't really protect much but the perimeter and main building so people could fight over the golf club. I just worry that one safe zone leads to more.
---
I actually think a bigger issue is spawn points. If they don't become somewhat varied you will inevitably have people camping them. I've seen games where when you fast travel you get some kind of invulnerability for a few seconds to port out. It was really only an issue because one clan was twice as large as every other faction on the server combined so they had the numbers. Give that we only have 24 players maybe that won't be an issue?
---
I like seeing a confrontational conversation turning productive. ;)
---
That damn music -\_-
---
I’ve been 4 of 10, since October 
---
I did it solo around level 50. Not too hard alone. More people = more bots in the silo
---
Elevator Music 15
---
That's not a smart thing to say to someone who might or might not have access to nuclear weapons, petulance notwithstanding.
---
I’m on PS4 and need those 2 trophies too if you wanna we can help each other out.  Pm me if your interested. 
---
We all like to see kittens learning to eat their first solid food, cute as F\*\*k :))
---
Same here since last patch, 1 out of 5 was successful. Wasted so much materials it was pointless.  One thing I know is.. If I see a glowing red from enemies I will just leave. I don't know why but every time I have failed SBQ all the enemies glowed red..  I know this is the "Targeting Hud" bug, but before all the nerfs none of this mattered.. 
---
I found a note called "O Holy Night," by a piano.
---
Finding out I couldn't play it was a huge disappointment. 
---
I use full sentinel assassins armour and run bloodied with my weapons and I tank killer for the stagger effect thanks for the tips ! So I have been doing it right now lol 
---
Same here, I stayed on that server until I was solo. The rocket camp was gone, but no ghouls spawned at the Golf Club anymore for the rest of my session (went there around five times after the nuke zone had faded away). First time I've seen that, and a shame that the campers negate spawns for everyone even after they log out.
---
Yep I have problems with healing factor as well. A server jump fixes it for me most of the time.
---
I take it this is down the road from the train station?
---
been playing since January.  
---
Once I decide to make a more or less permenant camp....
---
First one was north of the alligator - never attacked.
---
Moved south to a ledge on the savage divide.    
---
 Been attacked 3x - twice by ghouls and once by dogs.  After the first set of ghouls, I put up a fence - the 2nd attack bounced along the fence untl they fell off the cliff.  
---
Pack of dogs jumped the fence, but a couple turrets took care of them.
---
Never been attacked by another player.
---
(knocking on wood)
---
First post on this fucking sub I’ve upvoted. 
---
&gt;TheMeisterAce
---
I'm taking your advice and I'm abandoning Fallout 76.   I hope 90 percent of those playing the game do as I do and every single  server dwindles down to 2-3 griefers with no one to prey upon. 
---
 [Mcgriffrp](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mcgriffrp) I encourage you to do the same. Bethesda needs to be taught a lesson for making this abomination.
---
So sad that the railway rifle doesnt work with the rifleman perk and that the crossbow has no mods/perks for it and only goes to lvl 35. I found a quad barrel crossbow the other day but it's still a lvl 35 crossbow.
---
They spawn randomly at different locations.
---
A good spot to look is on the road between Sunshine Meadows and Point Pleasant then between Point Pleasant and Tyler County Dirt Track.
---
On that road, two or more random events will spawn.
---
Sounds cool but i dont know a scenario this would be used. Only scenarios would be stealth sniping your friend whos tanking the SBQueen or someone who's baiting for pvp. 
---
It's my experience that 2 Prime Fissure nukes on the same server will make for some problems in loot loads and the Queen's corpse disappearing. 
---
Bloody mess, and tank killer.... probably speed demon and marsupial for mutations too....
---
"Have you tried finding more green stuff?"
---
Mfw i gave my 4 star vampire, swing speed sacrificial blade to a friend. Havent seen him online since. :( 
---
Yep nice. Personally i like strength-based builds for the extra carry weight but rifles is fine
---
I lean towards yes, but I still have to get more drops. Here is my current theory:
---
1. Each player (and perhaps server) has a table of items with chances (like Quad is set to drop once per every 700 legendaries). Not sure if it resets per session or not. Also it could wear off and return to the base distribution.
---
2. If you sell an item to a vendor bot, its corresponding effect(s) and item type receives a small buff.
---
3. If you have an item equipped, its corresponding effect(s) and item type receives a small buff too.
---
4. If you have items in your stash in general, its corresponding effect(s) and item type receives a small buff too.
---
Currently, I have [a set of data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wuz0Hej1N5UOeXGvXKiq6h9N-utjWjhiFdqXLvfDwu8/edit#gid=1199519143) supporting this theory. 
---
* I sold 350 loot drops between Feb 19 and Feb 24. I got disproportionally many **Assassin's**, **Bloodied**, **Furious** drops.
---
* I dropped 350 loot between Feb 24 and March 2. I tallied the loot after a run (30 minutes) then dropped it. I got disproportionally many **Vampiric**, **Ghoul slayer's**, **Gatling Gun**, **Weightless**, **Regenerating**, **Leather** items matching my loadout and effects.
---
* I picked up and immediately dropped 100 loot on March 3 on a glitched server (I was alone, the Golf Club spawned Lvl 1 Eyebot (!), every enemy was 1\* only for hours). I got disproportionately many **Mutant slayer's**, **Exterminator's**, **Nocturnal**, **Assassin's** and **Troubleshooter's**. I have some legendaries in my stash with these effects but not as my loadout.
---
The next step is to loot 200-300 items, and sell only a very specific effect, for example, **Anti-armor** or **Instigating**. Unfortunately, it has to be uncommon for me but not too rare as it would take way longer. I also think the selling is more dominant because I had the same loadout during the 800 drops.
---
Went yesterday for the first time to grind golfers. Saw a lvl 26 camped behind white springs. Thought about trashing his camp decided not to.
---
Directly to the left of it if you are looking at it from where you spawn after fast travel.
---
What about that guy with Mr. Handsaw chasing me while not pvp flagged and hitting me, keeping me in combat. And actually damaging me fairly enough that I have to Stimpak? Then one shotting me through a X-01 once I'm flagged? Yeah no.
---
Hmm.. i was sure it was "This Shit Explodes" ??
---
Yesterday around noon central, a friend of mine messaged me about an SBQ nuke on xbox. I was just starting lunch, but got there in the last 5 minutes. Huge failure, they didn't even get her health down 1/4 of the way after her Regen. 
---
Why? 
---
Because all the people fighting her were standing on top of the bunker at Drop Site V9, trying to chip away at her. She wouldn't drop to the ground. You need to get people out there on the ground, away from that fence, and encourage her to stop hovering and drop to the ground. Level 80s hanging out on top of the bunker aren't gonna get her done like that. 
---
Level 20s also have no business coming to that fight. You have no chance of hurting her, all you're doing is making the fight tougher. Get out. 
---
Just treat PVP as some tough raider encounter....you can always cheat and hop server if you are afraid of losing your junk or a few caps.
---
Just be better, PVP’ers are the end game content!!
---
If you are on PC and like rifles I can craft and mod them for you. Gratis. As stated above, hunting rifles are a solid choice early on.
---
I see the radios everywhere and yeah I think if they were available to use in game it would be great.
---
Sometimes you are send all over.  Generally though, you won't be sent to high level areas from a low level quest.
---
How much RAM do you have? My experience is that 16 GB is not quite enough after a few hours of play. Rubber banding was there from the start and depends on the server: your client loads faster than the server does and it forces your client back to the zone starting position.
---
Exactly This!
---
I used to leave them unlocked, even put a sign with small letters by the door "Please Close Door", but still returned to find it always open, with Ghouls &amp; Mole Rats wrecking my workbenches.
---
Now I use the keypad door, but my Purifiers are all open to everyone.
---
Last night a level 17 wanted me to go help then kill 7 SBs, so they could reach general and launch a nuke. I told them there was no way they were strong enough to get through a silo. I know there's build guides online, but c'mon man. At level 17 I was still trying to decide what I wanted to spec into and thoroughly confused about how the perk card system worked, not worrying about trying to launch a nuke!
---
Id be talking to your teamates than, tell them if they want to pvp, do it while your not ingroup. And if they dont want to stop pvp'n, dont group up with them.
---
The game is not forcing you into pvp, your teammates are.
---
Hostile players should have a red triangle above their heads if they arent [HIDDEN], I dont pvp much but it worked most time for me.
---
And no I dont run a syringer build, but the weapon and ammo are super light, so its easy to pick outta your stash enroute to sbq.
---
When brute force doesnt work anymore you gotta get smarter.
---
Oh man I've been in for a while, thank you though
---
Completed it at level 25 or so, there must need to be lower level players there first that cause the spawn.
---
Do you mean “The Dragon”?  Did you nickname it or something?
---
Lvl 50 only done it once, full melee build, took like an hour to down the vertibird drone with a dragon rifle with limited ammo. Was exciting when i launched it, i plan on doing it again when i level up and rearrange my perks a bit. wasn't super hard although i'd make room for a few stimpacks or medic perks to lighten the stims.
---
Yeah I did about 30 server hops before I found the guy. I then sat on him and asked a friend to spawn in. The friend then came in with all 5 of their characters to have 5 shots at getting the right plans. I then did the same while they sat on him.
---
He is a container instead of a vendor, so you can't keep coming back with the same character...
---
Has anyone read or seen anything regarding account suspensions yet?
---
You found many threads explaining exactly what you was happening... And yet here you are starting an entirely new thread about it as if it's somehow newsworthy all over again AND you decide to throw in some fucking paranoid stealth nerf bullshit. 
---
I got a base parked with no turrets. Come and farm white springs without having to make stash runs :) 
---
Just selling stuff when you are near vendors should get it pretty quick.
---
Black Dragon?  Do you mean “The Dragon,” or did you nickname it or something?
---
Tentatively Shouting Expletives.
---
Because you got shot with a two shot explosive.
---
I literally just left the server and moved on.  What a joke that was, too.  
---
Absolutely. The area isn't as built up and populated  as DC or Boston was, so the destruction wouldn't be the same. However, the communities that survivors created following 76 would be present (Megaton, Diamond City, etc) and of course the Enclave would likely still have a solid presence in the area. Hell, maybe FO5 would have the protagonist side with the Enclave for part of or the whole story.
---
Regardless, I think it would be very interesting to do a "part 2" of an existing story; just a number of years later. 
---
it depends on if some highlvl passed trough the area sadly then u'll have high lvl creatures.
---
I have been event farming for a few days trying to find a tame-able deathclaw and I can confirm that he is always dead (have spawned him 5 or 6 times). I thought it might actually be a bug that his body is tagged as "traveling merchant".
---
Ah okay, that makes it interesting.. 
---
I would love to be able to play more of a support role. It was what my first character tried to be before I realized it wasn't really effective.
---
Most likely one or two hiding behind counters so nothing respawned
---
Son, did you crash daddy's space station again...?
---
I thought I told you to NOT put your Quantum Harmonizer in the Photonic Resonation Chamber!
---
Very cool!
---
The way I determine the armor variant (light, sturdy, heavy) is I equip the piece and use the images on the 76 wiki page of all armor types to see what it is, as I have had a hell of a time trying to find stats so I see what a heavy looks like and how mine compares, much easier for me
---
Nice. Im playing my second character now and people give me stuff all the time. As do I, when on my main. Giving people something they can actually use is way more helpful though. I get a lot of weird legendary weapons from strangers. I always make a heart and thumbs up for the effort, but seriously, what am I, a level 30 shotgun specialist to do with a level 50 mutants hunters tesla rifle!? 
---
I you really wanna help the noobs give them stimpacks, plans or a  weapon they can actally use **now**.
---
One of my favourites is crafting a  hardened, scoped, piercing. silenced hunting rifle and giving it to someone frsh out of Vault 76, along with 200 .308 rounds. They usually run away before I can get them to look in the bag ofc...
---
It's possible, there are intelligent deathclaws in Fallout lore. Now the question is did Graham eliminate his competition... 
---
They had in game buffs at one point tied to the lunch boxes. Thst ks why everyone flipped out and called them loot boxes. It was 15% more do, or 15% more ranged damage, or 15% melee damage boosts. There were some others as well. They never came out and said they were going to have the buffs no, but people data mining found the buffs were tied to the lunch boxes and the lunch boxes had the ATX prefix, which was the atom shop prefix.
---
Get the hell of your high horse. People enjoy this game, if you don't like that's fine and dandy, leave, don't come back and don't let the door hit you on the way out. No one will ever care that you played and left. 
---
Amen
---
I had the same issue a while back, was empath for sure in my case.
---
Actually it only makes them easier to kill. Just tag the ghouls with a few shots.
---
I suggest getting a friend to do it with, for your first time. It's easier solo, but only if you know where your going and what your doing.
---
Also, practice. Lots of mr. Gutsy and assaultrons in the silos. Learn how to take em down quick.
---
It’s very well worth the wanted level and bounty to blow the crap out of their camp when they do this. Satisfying actually!!!
---
That's what fat mans are for
---
I think it prioritizes Favorited stim-packs, could be wrong though. Lemme test it out. 
---
The quick stim button always uses the lowest healing amount stim you have. Like i have tons of diluted and it always uses those first. 
---
Dark, Wild, Grape and Orange Nuka - Cola are whitespring exclusive
---
Pacifist mode allows you, primarily, to avoid dealing inadvertent damage to other players. It says right on the tool tip that you can still be murdered. Its basically a way to make sure you arent going to accidentally initiate or confirm PVP when playing with players outside of your team. Sounds like you want an opt out instead, but pacifist is working exactly as advertised. 
---
not fixed. 
---
Good place for them! :)
---
  
---
i have the same problem and it looks like that RADIATION Dmg has his own desease pool. Ghouls deal rad dmg too so it can happen. my suggestion is that we need natural resistence as a perk to prefent us from this worms and postules but i cant test it or couldnt find out if its the truth or not :/
---
but what i can say that i had never every another desease only that stupid radiation ones!
---
Ok then waiting now
---
Yea it’s what i do 
---
&gt; if you don't like that's fine and dandy, leave, don't come back and don't let the door hit you on the way out. 
---
I'm more than happy to.  I just want the OP and every single person like him to do the same.
---
I’ve done the nuke run 4 times now, not once have I claimed it for myself. I sat back and let others do it. 
---
No they said current characters can be transferred over. No clue why. 
---
I found this post because I was searching for any news that they changed their minds about that. Terrible idea
---
This isn't rock band, bro
---
Did you get the hat plan?
---
Well I've been playing since beta. Killed them all and never had issues with that.
---
In terms of being a 76 player, I generally play everyday. Spent 9-10 hours yesterday alone staying up probably way later than I should have. 
---
I've seen enemies die when they clip with the ground. Seems likely that he's meant to be something else, so when he spawns his body is bigger than what he's meant to be, he clips, he dies. ;\_; 
---
When im running the 2H build i use any power armour set with 'Emergency Protocols' mod (speed increases by 25% and all incoming damage is halves when one's hit points drop below 20%).
---
 When I'm using fist weapons i use a mix of unyielding (a bonus of +3 to all SPECIAL stats (except Endurance) when you are at 25% or less health) and regular armour, however I'm super squishy and surviving is hard.
---
Hope that helps :)
---
BGS knows this is being done and isn't responding so we have to assume it's an allowed game mechanic.
---
..for that Todd Drama™!!!
---
I've had my camp not far from this place. Until someone launched a nuke at WS it was the perfect spot.
---
I bought 5 T-60 suits from him because I run a crew that's switching to this game from Red Dead. I got all my suits quickly and in good condition. TurdFergusonn is a very friendly businessman with great customer service. If there was a YELP for Fallout businesses I would give the Powerhouse 5 stars. 10/10 will continue to do business with 
---
I asked my 14 year old who doesn't play games, she tried it 3 times and failed every time even on my high level marsupial mutated character. She couldn't do it and didn't want to keep trying after 3 tries. So no people who do not play games can just walk over and do it. She even had my help showing her the controls beforehand.
---
Quit making things up to defend a company from putting in options for disabldd people. 
---
Once again, I will ask you again:
---
&gt;Why is it you feel it is the disabled persons job to fix the lack of support from Bethesda? When you see people in wheelchairs do you think places shouldn't have to have ramps to get into their stores and the wheelchair bound person should just have family or friends just carry them and their chair up the stairs?
---
My friend and I have also had a good couple of failures these last few days, something _weird_ happened yesterday though :P I have no idea what kind of weapons these guys had, and how many of them had it. But look at this :P This was their second, they launched their first only minutes before and that one died even faster, it was _insane_ :P My friend and I are running around with two-shot prime gatling guns and heavy weapons-perks, bloody mess and that's it and we barely make a dent on the queen but brutally murder everything else (all rise for when our weapons are broken), I cannot for the life of me understand how these other guys made such quick work of her :P Any tips from better players than myself? https://youtu.be/fD3Ujkwz8rQ
---
What about the upcoming raids?
---
It used to mean one shot kill everything and everyone until patch 5 nerf, which we all hate to admit, was needed for balancing. 
---
The long balance beam thing has a button half way along it that I am pretty sure you can only reach by completing the balance beam past a few turns.

I sent you a msg
---
I see how it works now! looking at the stats in inventory helps a good bit but comparing it visually on the character is a lot easier.
---
You had a workshop didn’t you? Workshops are optional PvP. You take a workshop, you opt-in to PvP
---
Triple shot espresso.
---
So what about the cashs shop? You realize all their other games have a "cash shop" as well "the creation club" that lets you buy mods. Yet they also unofficially support mods for those games as well, a Skyrim mod even just came out for multiplayer like 2 weeks ago.
---
If you have the chance to while the whole back side of the clubhouse gets bombarded with missile turrets
---
Im lvl 77 now and I still have not either. I have 8 Nuke cards now and know how to do it, I just havent yet. I will here soon in the near future. I would like to have someone along that would like to help. My biggest problem is I am always over encumbered and my stash is almost full again even with the increase so getting down to lower weight prior is going to suck....
---
It's a cool video, don't be such a Debbie Downer all the time.
---
Now if they could just have a piece of info on the inspect screen that states armor type, rather than in the name and only on non-legendary, that would just be awesome! But alas, that just makes too much sense 😂
---
This gives me some crazy ideas... thanks!
---
Aren't the items simply worth what someone is willing to pay for them? We are the economy, so we determine the prices - whether we are the sellers or the buyers. 
---
From the Plasma i know nothing BUT
---
YES I WANT MY FLAMER \`;..;´
---
the big problem is the ammo AND they brake extremly FAST even with the Weapon Perk on lvl 5 we can watch them falling apart -,- they are pretty nice weapons and we cant use them because they are to stupid to change some numbers in the game files to make them reliable weapons!!!
---
All been said already but I dont disagree, it needs to be fixed....
---
We all know PvP in this game sucks except for the chicken-shits that go after passive/PvE players that are easy targets.
---
I expect to see everyone of these losers on the new PvP mode survival server.   Right now, they're all bark and no bite.  We'll see how serious they are about PvP.
---
You respawn and can still contend for it if you seek revenge. If you do not seek revenge, the claiming continues until you shoot the invader to contend it.
---
Where do I get bong plans? Asking for friend.
---
I agree with the top two 1 million percent. But that last thing is different. NVR noticed that before. 🤔 Will test and see here in a few. If it is it's a recent thing. 
---
People have been asking for this litterally since before the BETA. Not a bad idea tho. 
---
It works again, but differently. (Doesn’t kick in until like 60% health, gets massive boosts under 10%.)
---
Also is heavily broken when used with Strange in Numbers. 
---
People love sitting around and thinking up these stories, huh. 
---
downvote me, ban me from this sub idc, these stories are fucking stupid and ridiculous and made up by people who thinking in-game shit sounds cool in real life. stop trying to sound like tom clancy or some shit, every gunfight in this game is a sloppy mess of running side to side and spraying.
---
Take any workshops? If so, you're in for a surprise.
---
Raids by Bethesda's definintion might not really mean "Raids" like in other MMORPG's. I've seen whats inside VAULT 96 already on youtube. There is enemies inside and its by far not an actual Raid... more like your "raiding the vault". Don't get your hopes up basically. 
---
I saw a 3 star legendary assaultron invader on my first nuke run
---
I just started one of these. Just a really big flat floor with a weapons workbench+stash on the back side. It's really convenient
---
I think it's a glitch. There's a spot on the map that I visit up near the munitions factory because there are random spawn where you can find outfit plans (Halloween, civil war uniform, etc). One of the spawns used to be a dead, human travelling merchant and another one of the spawns featured a living albino death claw and a dead regular one.  I haven't seen the human travelling merchant for a while, but I do run into the deathclaw travelling merchant quite often. Since the corpses spawn in the same place I'm thinking that the deathclaw model is simply spawning with the travelling merchant tag.
---
Hope they get it straightened out. 
---
Think that's a bug rather than a server issue. When you try to enter an abandoned power armor and it doesn't have a fusion core on it, your character freeze on the spot. It's not that game froze or something. it's just your character. Learned it the hard way myself
---
This has got to be the pettiest shit ive ever seen. You're such a tool. 
---
This is why I have my base in the ash heap. No one wants to live there.
---
Great when you find some T60 calibrated shocks lying around a certain location ;)
---
I will log out with all my doors shut, log back in and they are all open. that's not due to someone else leaving them open.  
---
but I didn't want locked doors because I want people to be able to use benches, etc, but I also don't want random mobs entering and destroying things.... 
---
so I got rid of all the doors on the first floor, and use marsupial to jump the door on a second floor landing.
---
I always throw extra ammo, plans, and assorted goodies in train stations.   Watoga and Grafton,  in the blue lunchpail,  are my go tos!
---
O yea never a dull moment. 😎😂
---
Y'all need to learn the lessons of the Sierra Madre. Picking up the junk, that's not the hard part. It's letting go.
---
I would die of happiness!
---
I built minion top of Seneca Rocks. I'm left alone for the most part.
---
A bug, a server issue.. Either way, it sucks pretty bad lol
---
Current camp has three doors.  I leave them open for the cross breeze.  Having the cooking fire inside gets smokey.  Just wish I could put up a damn clothes line  to air out this stinking underwear.
---
No doubt dude 😂
---
Use them to your advantage. I was on my level 12 alt and got to 18 in a few min by throwing grenades as the ghouls came out the door. So long as they are using the lowest level turrets you have time to tag everything lol
---
You’ve been gnomed!
---
If you walk up to it and scope it out, I'm sure an NPC will walk up to you and explain how friendly of a place it is.  But do NOT go in that locked back room.
---
And whoever keeps turning my sirens on..... I will fucking find you. 😈😈😈
---
I'm glad you read it. Sorry, you feel this way. If you do not like the game,  may I ask why do you even play, let alone read my whole story? 
---
I don't need your approval, or judgement. I like to write about my experiences. Believe it or not, hate it, whatever lol. It doesn't concern me. I will still be playing and waiting for a sweaty moment and then put a big ass write up on to reddit.
---
&gt; she tried it 3 times and failed every time even on my high level marsupial mutated character. 
---
No wonder when you jump 8 feet higher then you have to. 
---
It definitely isn't a gnoblin
---
I wish I could benefit from this but I’m level 120. Although any xp is good xp 
---
This is actually my second character as well, bought my friend the game and level up with him and it’s like a brand new experience, barely out of the first zone! Now I think about it he wants to do a rifle build so I might donate the rifle to him, I give him all my plans and recipes because I know I’ll use my lvl 80 build when he’s levelled up high enough
---
Pacifist modes only real use is in blast zones where alot of people are if you want to avoid pvp while farming 
---
The biggest threat I can recall were lvl50 Colonial Gutsy when I was around lvl 30-40, they were the only enemy I can recall moving carefully around if there was more than 1. They seemed to hit really hard, that was when I also had T-45 armor.
---
You win. Just choked on my coffee.
---
Game shouldn’t have pvp :/ lets face it 
---
If I'm on my level 170 I'll still use them and just tag stuff but if they are using turrets strong enough to kill the ghouls  befor people can tag them then I level there base. 
---
Destroyed one the other day and my reward for this public service 281 cap bounty. Pretty sure the level 5 in Flat woods I ask to kill me was happy for the caps.
---
And it’s gnot a gnelf
---
From what I have read on numerous posts on the subject, it seems more so that Charisma impacts the quality of the drops, Luck impacts the condition. But all of those posts are dealing with unyielding builds that are well beyond the 15 special cap and most players doing the testing are closer to or in excess of 30 points in each stat. 
---
Yep - put a fusion core in it before you do anything! I try to remember to have one in each now.
---
If any one hasn't done a nuke on and is on PC, add me, my friends and I pretty much run them every night... I'll let you push the button 
---
I'd say level 50 is a good time to do one. 
---
It's been Halloween for over 25 years.... #justsaying

This game has become a very divisive topic.  Either you love it or you hate it. I personally love it. There is a lot to do.  So my advice would be to shop around and get it as cheap as possible, and give it a try.
---
Mine is literally a hundred yards south of Alpha in the middle of the creek.
---
The queen is still bugged. A couple of times the queen’s health dropped steadily after being hit hard, but then all of a sudden at about 75% it never dropped further even the slightest, even though people never stopped firing. 
---
Happened to me this morning. When you got back up and running did you still have same character and progress or did you have to fully start over. 
---
I come across is every once in a while. Whitesprings lost a lot of hype. I nuke the University more so than anything. But when I do swing by Whitesprings and there’s a turret, I shut the back door. Usually whichever jackass is posted up there will run down and open it. So I keep closing it. They eventually get mad and start attacking me. Then I destroy there camp and kill them. It’s a win-win. 
---
Yeah I don't agree at all.  Activity in the game up to the TSE+White Knight nerf was an all time high in my opinion.  You could server hop and either find a freshly nuked server or if you were on a server with no nuke, usually someone would do one within 15 minutes.   Around 2-3 days after the Nerf, the level of activity in game was night and day different.  The frequency of nuking seems to be 1/10 what it was previously.  The activity level on the market place forums for all systems also seemed to go down after the nerfs.  From my perspective they pushed allot of people away, which would indicate that most were not happy with the nerf.
---
I'm doing exactly what you said I should do, and for that, you are saying that I am a tool.  And you still can't understand why I don't want to play a game with people like you in the game world. 
---
Which pretty much proves my point. 
---
Yes. It's a 3 star weapon and he added the mod
---
I definitely will from now on!
---
Never drop power armor unless you have a friend in a server. Learned that the hard way very early on with ultracite 
---
Thats what im saying. Imo the game was awesome at that time 👍 and most active also 
---
Yes. There dropping some new content in the next few weeks and it would be good to get a bit into it so you can do all the new things as soon as they’re out. Game is still buggy, but not as bad as it used to be. Endgame is really boring to be honest, but there’s enough to keep you busy for a long time. I haven’t played in about a month because of the lack of substantial updates, but I plan to get back into when the updates hit. 
---
Buy it cheap as you can, naturally, and I highly doubt you’ll regret it.
---
First time is always messy.

---
* **Fusion cores last longer than in Patches 3, 4, 5, without the respective perk card**. *Could be due to playstyle change: I used to power melee attack a lot before, now I use ranged but sprint a lot in Excavator PA and visit Watoga more frequently (3-5 FCs possible). I have Batteries Included 3 and kept slowly accumulating FCs in the past two weeks.*
---
* **Weapon with longer fire animation may not unequip when they break.** Happens a lot with my Gatling Gun and during SBQ fights - the server lag may come during the firing animation and thus fail to auto-unequip the gun.
---
* **Gatling Gun seemingly breaks faster after Patch 6 for me**. *With Gunsmith 5, a silo run with 750 rounds spent lowers the condition from 200% to 95%. In SBQ fights, the gun breaks after 1.7k rounds from 200%. As far as I can remember, it used to last 2.5k rounds before. I got melee-attacked a lot more so maybe that breaks the gun held too? Or if GS 5 no longer works for this gun, even re-equipping. Or I used to run with 3x1 Heavy Gunner. Now I have 3x3 Heavy Gunner which would imply the damage output increase wears down the gun faster?*

Rose's quests get dicey pretty quickly. Charleston area isn't too bad until you get to the final exam for Firebreathers. 
---
I mean for $30 you are going to get your $’s worth even if you end up not liking it.  
---
There’s enough content to get you some value even if you don’t fall in love with the surviving/grinding/farming/pvp/trading portion of the game.
---
Plus, new content is coming out soon.
---
Did you place them or actually drop them from your inventory?
---
I went on a nuke launch when I was lvl60-something, the players I teamed up with had everything I was just along for the ride. I am now lvl101 and starting a nuke run, getting all the keys and the cargo bot, I think I have 2 more keys to get then I am off to Blow Shit Up.
---
Hey my camp is right opposite the munitions factory (for the location tho not the workshop), but I havnt found any spawns, would you mind describing it a little?
---
I'm trying to find the .50 cal hunting rifle plans....any of them. 
---
I ran a silo once with a friend, disconnected right as we got to the launcher. Got back in, thankfully my friend waited till I was inside the cell the launch the nuke to at least get that stupid quest completed 
---
I'm not sure if I ever got that far, don't remember but sure am looking forward to it.
---
True - I've got my timing pretty good for placing the armor sets, arranging, and then stashing. Gets tricky sometimes, but safer than dropping.
---
Now these are the real questions
---
Is this a thing that's confirmed to be coming? Anyone have a link to that, I'm new here
---
Wazzzzuuuuuuup?!
---
Every time im at fissure prime. Its so annoying. Lol. I usually throw my arms up emote and someone usually takes care of it for me. I think everyone knows what that means. Especially when your jumping around like a crazy person.
---
I see this frequently all over the map, not just the SBQ fight.
---
It only ever happens with Wild Mongrels, and all their sub-types. The go all noodly, and you can KIND of target then in VATS, but otherwise they're REALLY hard to hit.
---
Some really annoying spaghetti dogs.
---
&gt; But most people was happy with the nerf
---
Oh, did not realize you were replying to your own comment.  You said the above which made me believe you thought most were happy with the nerf.
---
Even if you kill the queen, from what I understand there’s no way your getting enough reward to warrant the outlay anyway.  I’m also new to the game, and watched manyatruenerds essay on it yesterday. It was an eye opener. Frankly once I’ve done the quests, which to be honest I’m slowly trudging through, I’m not sure whether I’ll bother with the end game or not.
---
I love fallout games, but this game just feels meh. I find myself wanting to go back and play but once I’m in, I just don’t get exited. They’ve got a lot of changes to do to make players feel rewarded for their efforts.
---
I just realized what it reminded me of after I posted. That slinky dog on toy story.
---
Very true. If you’re willing to drop your health low enough, a plaine olde one-star non-explosive bloodied is more powerful than a fancy three star TSE. I’m currently using a bloodied double barrel and love it, it’s more powerful than the TSE version I also have. AND I can fire this thing point blank and never worry about killing myself. TSE is so yesterday. 
---
I'm a pvp player but I chose not to pvp in fallout 76. Too many glitches and bugs, lack of balance, laggy as shiet server, no reward, broken pvp system in general. I mean this game litally screams no pvp
---
I never personally said you should do anything, I'm just here observing what a self righteous prick you are. Also I haven't played 76 in over a month, but I will be returning soon. Glad that your dumbass wont be there.  
---
If your camp is too close it will stop the event from spawning.
---
Been saying that since the day they announced the stupid af system of one shoots the other and does 'very little damage' and the other person has to shoot back to agree to PvP.
---
It was obvious from that kind of dumb-ass suggestion that they had no idea what in the fuck they were doing and that PvP was going to be a dumpster-fire.
---
You do realize this post is 44 days old?  
---
I have my camp on top of Seneca Rocks
---
Do they have crafting stations and all ?
---
It's not a glitch or a bug. And no, you weren't just a few minutes late before he got killed.  It's a random encounter meant to provide some consternation, and perhaps a little levity.  There is no Deathclaw merchant in FO76.  FO76 is full of areas that will trigger a "random" encounter from a set list of possibilities when a player enters the area.
---
"...why can I find absolutely no items in all of Flatwoods?"
---
*Jump cuts to Excavator Power Armor guy jumping off of high-dive into Junk swimming pool at his base*
---
Again, I will ask you again:
---
I have been on a team where my teammate and i both percieved the dog in the same way.  I have on occasion had some luck with VATS on these guys.  Sometimes not.
---
It’s already easy. The aim is to make it less tedious.
---
No. It's not a glitch. It's a specific random encounter.  Is the exact same thing as finding the dead bodies with the random Halloween costumes, or the other deathclaws.  One just happens to be a dead "traveling merchant" deathclaw...either to confuse the player (as in your case) or provide some levity in others.  But it's not a bug. 
---
Clearly the Deathclaw choked on the merchant!
---
You don't want to see them.  They are just platforms with turrets everywhere.  They often used the base duplicating exploit to add like 30 turrets too.
---
Worst part is you can hear the damn thing takin bites out your ass. But no visual on it at all. 
---
Are there quests like in the other Fallout games or are they more like MMO quests? 
---
Find 20 etc etc.
---
If it has meaty quests i'll def give it a go
---
(Currently on sale for £15) 
---
But can also pick up RDR2 for near the same price...and can't afford both atm.
---
I havent been able to find any positive criticism online, and no info about how the quests feel.
---
Love to help you out, but I'm on XBOX.  I have made all my launches solo and the first was the hardest because I had never been in a silo before and it took 45 min. - and hour to get it launched.  The worst problem  for me was getting lost and figuring out the proceedure, but I managed and launched my first nuke without getting killed.  I have gotten killed at least 4 times while doing the  solo silo run, but just run back down and pick up where you left off.  I suppose it could be fun with a friend or part of a team, but I am friendly/lonewolf too and there is just that feeling of supreme accomplishment that comes from doing it by yourself that I'm sure you understand. You can do it!
---
I mean me too, but that’s pretty much why I’ve quit at this point, they want to focus on the aspect of the game that’s been broken since it’s was even first thought of for the future of the game when they should just be removing it. Nobody asked for fallout with pvp, literally nobody wanted that. I always imagined a Bethesda rpg being a coop game like borderlands. Not this jacked up PvE game with no sense of ballance for PvP. I mean seriously who ever said “I want to play fallout 4, but pvp” I could have told you the explosives shotguns would and the two shot explosives weren’t gonna work for pvp before the game even released lmao. 
---
Someone post a thread the other day debunking the myth of being killed via slap damage.
---
 You're doing something that's triggering PvP for you. So it's fair to say you want to never ever be able to do anything that gets you flagged for PvP if you're in passive mode. But you're not being killed without somehow getting flaggged.
---
How do bloodied weapons work? Why do people want them now?
---
&gt;Just give players a true passive mode and be done with it. While passive mode is on you can't do workshops. Problem solved everyone is happy
---
I want them to do this but also leave Slap Damage so sneak attack one-shots and shit aren't just rampant for those who do sometimes engage in PvP.
---
Does it have vaults similar to the other games.
---
Where each is its own little quest?
---
I love the idea of exploring, but needs to me more than just that to keep me busy
---
That could make for some interesting rp...medic kept shooting me up with chems each fight and now I’ve got the DTs and need to stay on a fix all day. Actually would fit very well with vault tech in general. Thanks doc!
---
Oh come on.  You didn’t get nothing.
---
You shed pounds of ammo,  you got to go back home and fix at least three guns,  you got to farm healing mats all over again.
---
I lost you there. Thats my impression . I hated the nerf . But got downvoted as fuck when trying to write about it back then so i just gave up and accepted most were happy with the nerf 
---
Games been out for months and people still don’t know you can click the armor to place it instead of R to drop it. Dropping it removes ownership, essentially despawning it unless someone claims it. Clicking and placing lets you retain ownership and connects it to your inventory. If you click place it will return to your inventory after ~60 seconds. Share to save a ~~life~~ power armor.
---
The fact you are comparing this to wheel chair ramps is why I continue to ignore you. That and you are not the OP who is the only one who isn't arguing completely hypothetical. If I'm going to have a conversation about he needs of someone with a disability I will talk to the person with the disability not someone who lacks one trying to white knight for them.  
---
If think people who want passive mode to be 100% protection from PVP should be teleported back to Fallout 4. There you go, no other players, no PVP. 
---
You got slap damage, You got server hoping, protected loot, 0 death penalties and you also got blocking- yet somehow people still find it difficulties to deal with PVP. We used to deal with PVP without any of these things and no one compained how PVP is unfair. This is exactly what MANT talked in his video, what went wrong with F76-"Compromises to cater F4 playerbase, made game so easy. that it fails to deliver any exiting experience to online players". If anything, Slap damage shouldn't not exist first place.
---
They should let us get buffed at camps, increased damage and damage resistances 
---
You have to buy each of the less powerful linings from Enclave production and install them first. After you add each mod, the next one becomes available for sale.

Top of the World signal. Starts when you listen to the radio station. She's a hoot.
---
Start at the gates, facing the factory. To your right, beyond the trees a bit, should be some cliffs. Go to the cliffs and stay right beside them, keeping them to your left, as you head east. Not due east though.  Keep hugging the rocks as you travel. Eventually, you'll be walking on this rather large and flat outcropping of rock. When you get to the edge, you'll need to jump back down upon the ground. I usually crouch here because you're getting near the spot.  Keep moving forward with the cliffs still to your left and you'll round a slight bend. Now you should be approaching a small hill. There will be two boulders to the left, kind of close to the cliff, and near the top of the rise, on the right, will be a single wild carrot flower. The spawn point is on the flat section at the top of this rise.  Sometimes there won't be anything there.  Other times there will be a tank, un-exploded nuke, the albino deathclaw I mentioned, dead trick or treaters, dead civil war re-enactors, etc, crashed satellites, etc.
---
Unfortunately the quests in 76 don’t resemble quests for any other fallout games, because there is no nPC interaction.  Although I would consider them “meaty” they lack the depth that fallout 3 and 4 had quest wise.  Red dead 2 on the other had is an amazing single player game. And I would recommend that until the cows come home, but I personally enjoy 76, it’s not for everyone.
---
Posted to wrong comment: Top of the World signal. Starts when you listen to the radio station. She's a hoot.
---
IMO, it would go a lot better if the Cargobot dropped after you destroyed all of its thrusters or arms (I forget what the game calls them).  Right now, it's one of those enemies where you can disable everything on it, and still need to stand there shooting it for a minute or so because it has so much HP.
---
It increases damage the lower your health. It could go upto 50% at very low health. Paired with adrenal reaction. It goes very high. 
---
You can use unyielding or bolstering gear to add defence to your low hp build.
---
Or run sent. Assassin as a form of defence.
---
Snipers or ranged users make a huge benefit from bloodied, because they use stealth.
---
Ohhh I think I started that quest and that's when I stopped playing.
---
I have, and I was greeted by a level 17. They killed me :(
---
Sure, I agree it should not be called Two Shot then.
---
At the moment it still adds 189% dmg to the weapon.  If you start at base weapon dmg of 100, you can get to 300 on that TSE.   You cannot get there with any other weapon with the same perks.  Because the way the two shot works, it multiples the bonuses from all other abilities/perks.
---
If they made it where each perk/ability multiplied on base damage and then ADDED that amount at the end, then that would be less OP/Broken.
---
Bloodied/unyielding requires a build focused around that, so not the same.
---
Ahh I understand now.  Yeah I do agree with your initial thoughts too then.  Most that played have stopped even coming here, so yeah you could be down-voted, but it does not make you wrong.  Some are keeping their eye on this like me, I read this subreddit with the hope that Bethesda is going to actually wake up and listen to the data and see that they are making the game worse than making it better, and maybe turn the wheel back the other direction.    
---
Its just the choice of 76 or picking up RDR2 again.
---
Which i enjoyed, but would like to explore the wastelands.
---
Just can't find any info about how meaty the quests are.
---
Does it have a main storyline that you can follow and it leads you to fun things? 
---
Does the world have lots of interesting things to explore..or is it more of an MMO experience where you have to grind up doing fetch quests etc.
---
If there's a solid story or two in it, with interesting places to explore I can look past the bugs etc. 
---
Just worried after all ive seen that it might be, as Total Biscuit used to say 'as wide as an ocean, as deep as a puddle' and that I'd have more fun trying RDR2 again.
---
I'll get both at somepoint..but need to fill the next couple of weeks and can only afford one atm
---
Seems like everytime I am there, there are at least 2 or 3 of them that want to come get me... Its bad enough there with everything else you have to deal with but then they pop up and have to get involved as well...
---
Wow that's a big difference. Hope his parents didn't find out about that nuke.
---
Do you have carnivore? 
---
Yes, you can. I scrapped 200+ combat armour arms and learned a LOT of mods, apart from pockets, which I had to get from events.
---
I think everyone has seen this at some point.  I've noticed it most in the area around Hawke's Refuge, but I don't think location matters.
---
10-15 shots? I'm lvl 82, in full marine armor and I got killed twice by ONE shot (enemy was lvl 115-130 I think) and I couldn't even strike back since I usually play in pacifist mode.
---
Lol I feel you and now realize that it has to be bugged. I am doing this quest now and have been at 6/10 for months... I just noticed while doing another quest in the Mire that all of a sudden my counter is now at 9/10 and I honestly dont remember killing 3 more?? If I did yay for me but I think I would have remembered it because I have been trying for the last 3 weeks or so now and have not seen a golfer at all!
---
Woosah...
---
I bet people did not try and steal from him too often or argue over prices!
---
I believe that’s the ones for the enclave under armor. There’s bos under armor, marine under armor, raider under armor, vault under armor and casual under armor. 
---
I will check that out tho just to be sure.
---
Seriously. If you're shooting at me and dropping bombs on my head without a response, it probably means "move on." 
---
Now we found each other again 👌 even what people say imo the nerf was too hard . I dont pvp so i cant say how tse effected pvp ofc but 
---
They've not added anything as far as I'm aware but they released their dlc roadmap. 
---
Lmao. This paragraph reads like it should end with  “and remember, ALWAYS use protection, and make sure you get your parents permission”
---
Geez has no one even tried to talk to them? Steve there just wants a friend to pound brews with, and for people to ride on top of him like falcor. 
---
Wouldn't it get annoying having to wear breathing gear (or use something that blocks airborne disease) all the time?
---
Don't get me wrong.  I sometimes think about camping in the Ash Heap too because, well, almost no one ever does.
---
Pro Tip: When you clear Bubbles of all the Nuka Cola you want just join a different server or re-log and her inventory refreshes so you can buy more!
---
LitEraLly uNpLaYaBle!!! 
---
If they reappear crouched, the rifleman can just easily headshot the dude manually then.
---
I doubt those type of people would be willing to try skills against real PVP people.
---
Fire Axe, not only well balanced for its levels, but just soo much fun to play as axe cop.
---
It's alright we all have our moments
---
You can change the controls in the settings tab
---
I doubt they will go there for long, they perfer to PvP people who are not speced for PvP they don't want a challenge they want domination.
---
I know about that - and I get what you're saying but I like my C.A.M.P to be as realistic structured as it can be. No floating objects, and I like the feel of a home/base not a bunker. Like I said, if my character is able to take minimal damage in pacifist so should my C.A.M.P it'll give us the time needed to take cover, change up and fight back before everything gets levelled or even if you're not at C.A.M.P, you'd be able to fast travel just in time.
---
All you need is the 1 keycard. They launch codes (which change each week), can be found on [https://nukacrypt.com/solved](https://nukacrypt.com/solved) once they're solved (the side can help you solve them too if you have enough pieces of a code).
---
Might be worth carrying more than one keycard, as it's used up if you put the wrong launch code in. Found that out the hard way. Luckily I was able to get to Whitesprings to start the cargobot tracking quest, get the new keycard, and run back through the silo to try again. The bots had respawned, but the doors were are still open.
---
I absolutely love written directions too, so much more fun than a picture. Thank you sir! 
---
It actually \*is\* there to protect you.  Its meant so you do not accidentally trigger PVP mode and get killed if you do not wish it. Thus its protecting you.
---
This might help, too.  https://imgur.com/gallery/FrqjcLy
---
The custom location marker is near the point (as is last death haha), but the current position icon is directly on top the spawn point on this map.
---
I guess. Need to reword question. When this thing happens does everyone see it this way or just a select chem riddled few?
---
Have to agree with you.  Lots of reasons not to PVP in this game and the PVP mechanics and lack of rewards is right at the top of the list.  I choose not to because I just want to be a grumpy yet helpful old hermit in the hills kind of guy.  I used to do the Destiny crucible everyday.  I hosted a killing floor every night for at least a year in Gears Of War 1 and 2.  Love PVP when I want it, don't want it here, but I don't always get to choose and that's also part of the attraction this game can have.  Never know when some asshat and his buddies are gonna go rogue on you. 
---
Yes Vendors, as in people who run shops.
---
I've found lots of threads with nothing officially noted from Bethesda. So how am I to know what's true or what isn't? 
---
We’re bros now
---
Wow, that’s funny. 
---
Vaults are supposed to be in the new confent: [roadmap](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019) 
---
If you like exploring the map is huge.
---
I know that.
---
Doesn't change the fact it was a terrible choice in the first place.
---
Is 76 the type of game where you have to find your own fun? 
---
I love exploration...but if there isn't much more than that, RDR2 may be a better choice.
---
Was just hoping that all the stuff online was clickbait hate...and there was a main storyline and decent sidequests etc. 
---
I don't mind the lack of NPCs, if they are robots or whatever...but as long as they send me off on fun quests. 
---
Or is it mainly a looter/shooter with the main aim being level up and take on bigger and badder enemies.
---
Agreed.  Open world PVP with no restraints should have been the way this game was released.  Hopefully the new survival mode delivers on this.  Bethesda was very clear that this was not a mainline Fallout game like 3 &amp; 4, it was a supplemental niche game.  I think they messed up by not taking PVP far enough in 76.  I have to be 'that person' but if you don't like PVP then this game isn't for you.  The fact that Bethesda started obliging the anti-PVP crowd is why this game is in such an awkward state.  It was always meant to have PVP play a large role, the entire system of Workshops proves that.  The wasteland isn't safe.  I want a harder challenge than a group of bullet sponge Super Mutants, I want to fight other players.
---
Remove passive mode.
---
All I know is that before the last patch, I'd never run into the deathclaw merchant before and now I regularly see it in places the human travelling merchant used to be.  If it is intentional...cool.  No big deal either way for me. 
---
Not kidding, was the fist time in 3 weeks of me going to Watoga to clear I that I've witnessed the robots fighting off a scorch beast.  
---
The only other time I had seen a scorchbeast in town was when I uploaded the virus on top of the mayor's tower and then it was yellow and attacked the col gutsys.  These 2 times, I looked to see who else was in the city to help but nobody else in the city, so wasn't because of the maybe for the day quest.  My fist time getting a great loot drop from a scorch beast as well.  Also, fist time last night I had liberators in the whitesprings clubhouse instead of ghouls.  Was just curious if there was some new changes going on.  
---
Yeah but how do you REALLY feel? :-D 
---
It's a wrong model its supposed to be an encounter of human merchants and dead brahmin but for some reason they sometimes spawn as deathclaws
---
Don’t get me wrong.. there are quests ... and a lot of them... however the bulk are obtained from notes, and holotapes.. there is the occasional robot that gives u a quest though. The exploration is nice.. the building a base is nice but needs some work.
---
I got one that dies 50% limb damage and vampires with sacraficial blade my favorite melee weapon 
---
I'm using Pacifist as a figure of speech related in-game. As per, it should take reduced damage like your character does while in Pacifist. 
---
What about bugs ? They fixed them ? I mean, most of them atleast ?
---
&gt; Wouldn't it get annoying having to wear breathing gear (or use something that blocks airborne disease) all the time?
---
Not really. You can use a Bandanna or gas mask / hazmat suit, craft disease cure or just fast travel to White Springs and get a drink from the fountain to cure diseases for free prior to farming it.
---
I like my spot, it has a Super Mutant / Robo spawn, 1 fusion core, 2 power armor spawns for more cores / armor, a random spawn point and a medical facility nearby with plastic / loads of chems.
---
Not the best scenery by far, but I frequently get a view of a mushroom cloud on the horizon as people nuke White Springs.
---
I wouldn't say so. Many bugs have been fixed but the endgame got worse (SBQ glitches, nerfs, worse loot chances). You could wait for the things in the roadmap but given the experience, I'd wait a year till they fix the bugs those dlcs bring in...
---
Are their no vaults at all currently? 
---
A big open map and bizzare vaults would be good enough.
---
As long as they have 'Garyyyy' moments
---
So, you want to change the leveling system to ES system?
---
 Ana is that you?
---
Doesn't change the fact that you could just change it and not complain about it in the first place 
---
But doesn't the Perk itself represent your proficiency with said weapon type, along with the ranks and Expert/Master perks?
---
You spent the time to level up, and invest in those perks.
---
What you seem to be suggesting is individual skill levels, which unless capped like the SPECIAL currently is, means we'd all end up Maxed out in everything.
---
I'd much prefer an easier way to relocate SPECIAL points, since that'd let me go from Sniper to Melee, without being OP at everything.
---
I never really experienced many but from what I hear when they get fixed more get introduced. 
---
You're too low for this discussion, mister. Now go to your camp and think about what you've done.
---
I wouldnt really consider level 45 low tbh.
---
Also not a party pooper but i never understood why these stories get so popular to the point of getting silver, if not more they have not rally anything to them, just fighting off someone, we all have. 
---
But well... i guess im gonna get downvoted for saying this now. /shrug
---
The Scorched Killer receiver mod (available from the Firebreathers bot) also add a star to ranged weapons.
---
I agree with that.
---
An end user of mine, who had some strange noises inside the case, (turned out that 2 fans were off kilter and dying), and was livid that "gnomes you put in the PC, are useless at fixing broken parts'.
---
Something triggered your PVP mode.   I've seen posts where people whole melee someone until they triggered the AoE mutation that hits back, then that turned on the PVP mode.  The aggressor then takes out a gun and 1 shots the defender.  
---
But I do not think that works that way.  Some say you have to kill another player with the AoE strikeback.  I've personally never seen any evidence of this.  I have often been shot by griefers trying to kill me but they never can because it does like 5 HP of slap damage.  Even with TSE.  I just stim after 30 seconds ... I want to get to 10% life so I can waste as much of their ammo as possible.
---
Here's a post on /r/FO76 from 3 months ago about the Deathclaw merchant.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9ugr03/i_came_across_a_deathclaw_named_traveling/
---
I had no issues at all doing it alone, also you DONT need lock pick or hacker Lvl 3 either...
---
Says the dude in a forum full of this shit, who could have just scrolled on and not complained about my post in the first place.
---
Chill, fuck. 
---
Casual shielded is a drop.  It’s rare. 
---
Yea, pretty on the nose, lol.
---
I got a crapton of ore and a missile launcher
---
I had my first experience recently, saw some lone ghouls on the golf course, the ones everyone is looking for. They are like three times my lowly level of 15 (I don't play much) so I just booked it past. Thought I was going to get through quickly when I hear all hell break loose behind me and my stamina runs out. Now I am just breaking what feels like 3.5 MPH and it sounds like hundreds of fat man nukes are going off. I thought the robots were coming after me, I run from assaultron bots and I had ran past 5-6 of them. I also didn't know they wouldn't kill me on the spot. But I fast traveled to my camp as soon as I could.
---
Pretty sure that Bethesda mistakenly confused Helvetia's celebration with Basel Switzerland's. The road-map does line up with Basel's.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_of_Basel
---
That'd be so freakin' awezome. I could get more time running my diesel generator, but I hate the noise.
---
This isn’t oblivion. 
---
Because people come inside my camp wave and destroy the place, yes I am looking at you angry guy on Valentine’s Day ruining my shit!
---
Watch out for Vats though.
---
Mines and thrown grenades can be targeted, not sure about Launcher Ammo though.
---
Xanax would do you wonders. 
---
Oh he hurt you a lot more than helped you.
---
Don't carry around rifle weight for 43 levels???!!!  Either in stash or on person!
---
Drop it if legendary or scrap it if not.  You will be thankful later.
---
He should have dropped you a level 10 rifle or something.
---
&gt; endargerol
---
^ this stuff is busted and doesn't work. Hasn't worked since launch afaik.
---
Tiger Sex Expertise 
---
End game ? I was like lvl 76 is it endgame for you ? because maybe I can atleast play for a few more levels ?
---
Confirmed. Added that to a 3 star two shot submachine gun I use on those annoying scorched found in various places.
---
Well I knew that, I just got overly confident since no one else was on the server. I thought they would be safe to drop so I could see what I had and work on them without having to constantly replace them every minute. It was a pretty stupid thing to do.
---
If theyre in excavator and you're well specced for damage chances are they'll underestimate you and you've got a fighting chance. I like the mine usage though i always just sell to merch, have literally never laid one down on purpose. Once i was on a rocky ledge going to throw throw some grenades down at a death claw, but i tossed a mine out, realised i had no grenades, went down to poke the deathclaw, and it set off my mine and broke my leg. Your strategy is better. 
---
You don't need to server hop. He despawns after a little while. Just go do an event or some selling and come back later. I got him 3 times yesterday on the same server. 
---
Sometimes bags fall through the floor. It is a known issue.
---
Why walk around with a ton of junk? You have stash boxes at your camp, Red Rockets, Workshops, Train Stations etc. There really is no need to lose anything unless you just like living dangerously. I PVP a lot so I always make a point to stash junk that I am unwilling to lose
---
I'm heading north up the Atlantic seaboard... when I get to Mass (summer, 2020), I'll be on the lookout for anything familiar from Fallout 4 &amp; Far Harbor. 
---
&gt; I found it infuriating that an OP player could kill me on the spot in non-reciprocated PvP with just a single shot from their TSE.
---
You're right, that would be infuriating if it ever happened. Thankfully it didn't. It's never been possible, even with bugs glitches and other cheating behavior.
---
Tick sucker emote.  ()
---
I dropped them
---
I'm a little late to this party but I think I figured it out. This happened to me a bunch of times and I realized it's because we were all part of an "event". Yesterday I was at Poseidon and Thunder Mountain contesting the workshops and could not VATS either owner. I realized that I needed to actually go into my pipboy and ignore (I don't remember the term) the quest. As soon as I did I could VATS those players again. 
---
Wrong game
---
I was actually telling another player the same thing after some PVP sessions, it seems Armor effects Sometimes don't even work.
---
They also use that music in the Whitespring shops. I despise it.
---
TSE nerf was completely justified. This is where we disagree. The change that should have happened was making SBQ interesting and not just a bullet sponge from the get go. A group of 8 players should be able to kill her with lv 50 non legendary guns. 
---
Better on PC: 'H' for emergency healing and 'G' for gestures. 'E' can be 'invite to team' or 'exit power armor'. 
---
Lots of potential there.
---
I've found mines to be extremely useful against griefers too, I'm not low level (about 107) but have had my share of griefers both at workshops and whilst wandering the wastes.
---
Players don't expect nuke mines, they've often seen me lay a trail of mines behind me but expect them to be frag so still try to rush me and just shrug the dmg...nope wrong they're nuke.
---
It's quite pleasing to the eye seeing them die and be flung into the air lol
---
  Most of the high level ghouls I've encounted are in what appears to be a straightjacket with one arm out, the other still tied behind the back.
---
That's probably the best way to go... I assume all the Overseer's cache share the same items?
---
I dropped them with the intention of picking them back up. I'm not sure how the servers work but they were all at Camp Adam's about 5 hours ago on xbox if anyone can get them and wants them. I'm not sure if they're still there.
---
I re-did my mutations yesterday thinking that was the case, but it wasn't, and even though after I re-did them my Adrenal Reaction still didn't work as it should.
---
You did not specify your level or how far you got in the quests / on the map. If you want to finish up the quests and max out the map, you may come back (many bugs fixed). Beyond that, I have my doubts.
---
I just take out the turrets, and let the ghouls swarm the base.
---
Does more damage than I can, and saves a few caps on the bounty.
---
Yup. I've been collecting from those containers since I got Can Do and I've had to take to using FDC reduction armor so I can have all that canned food on me. My favorites are Cajun Rice &amp; Beans and Canned Coffee though I've been hoarding Nuka Colas every time I come across them so the favorite drink is still contested.
---
Some mats have to be bulked to sell. Aluminum , Springs and Steel come to mind off the bat. 
---
Just a side note for you guys... A set of ghouls spawn for each "new" character at the golf house.
---
So what she ran into was a spawn set for someone else that was higher level.  
---
However, you guys should have had a bunch of level 35 ghouls spawn too.  
---
Best way to approach the clubhouse is to wait for everyone else to leave and no one is there, then go there.     Kind of like the anti-social club house really.
---
Plus other players know this and when they see others go there, and come over and kill your ghouls.
---
I never even got to use my ultracite and it was so awesome looking!
---
Are they fun?
---
Does it have parts similar to FO3? 
---
You find an area...it keeps you busy for a few hours. 
---
Weird and interesting content.
---
Or are the quests just...go here..shoot and loot etc.
---
If it has an awesome world and moments like the others did, i'll prob have a lot of fun with it.
---
I hear the lack of NPCs make it quite lonely...which I like the sound of, but I kind of want really fun quests to go with it
---
It's a very minor thing, but I think it would be cute if they did the Sims thing where you get better at an instrument the more you play it.  The first time you pick one up, you're out-of-tune and sound terrible.  But if you do it everyday, you get to how it sounds now.
---
Also, there really needs to be more than one Wind Instrument.  It makes no sense how that plan costs as much as the Acoustic Instruments, but only contains a tuba.
---
I'm gnot a gnelf.
---
How does squad manuevers impact sprint speed? 20% additive?
---
I just watched a video on it but he didn’t say what events drop it, any ideas? 
---
I get that with the right legendaries any of them are good. But with a lack of mods combat knife is the only choice if you had the exact same legendaries. I honestly feel one handed medium weapons got more attention. They all have mods if I remember correctly.
---
Yes anytime you're swapping perks to reduce repair/crafting costs or even slow hunger/thirst you become vulnerable.
---
Aight I went pretty far in the main quest and did many side quests too
---
Guess I'll wait a bit aaaaand
---
Play skyrim as usual until they add stuff to the game 
---
Thanks for the answer tho
---
But all the other kids in the vault said they've done it! 😭
---
I'm really glad I don't deal with end users much anymore. 
---
That or if you sprint/jump you're revealed.
---
Ahhhhh, just how I wanted to start my morning: terrified.
---
That was pretty cool, though. So it was supposed to be in-game, but wasn't? If I'm understanding correctly.
---
Any chance you are using a targeting HUD on your power armor?  These HUDs are a known cause of CTDs.
---
Targeting HUDs are like a virius!  You have one and it gets passed to the mobs who in turn pass it to everyone around them.  This is why you will sometimes see the highlight effect when you are not using a HUD.
---
This guy gave 500 .308 rounds to my level 5 character a little bit ago.
---
I actually put up a camp in what sounds like the same area near belching betty and rusty pick. But more importantly the relay tower. They're not great but its something to do, and unless I'm camped 20 feet away from one i never use the requisitions.
---
Its the post apocalyptic wasteland. Fair doesnt matter
---
I dunno, I feel if you want to pvp you should be all in. As an ex-wow rogue, the sneak attack one-shot was the bread and butter. In this there at least is a Revenge so you don't have to wander the map looking for them aimlessly
---
I do have my own disability, you know the world isn't all just you and one other person. So you realize you are wrong and that is why you won't answer my question because you know it ties into this and it just strips it down to a situation where the answer is obvious.
---
Not the first time I’ve heard of this happening either, I don’t launch often though.
---
Holy moly! I guess I gotta get on it then! Thanks for the reply. Wasn't sure I'd hear anything back, as this was an old thread. Take care, and thanks again! 
---
&gt; I actually put up a camp in what sounds like the same area near belching betty and rusty pick.
---
Yep, that's it 
---
IMO they should introduce level/gear score matching with the new pvp mode. Lower lvl players will not stand a chance against higher level players, they would just dominate all servers.
---
At whitesprings, or the prime fissure
---
Dont tell your papa I said that
---
You don't mind having to do so. Others expect good UI design from a AAA studio. Both attitudes are equally valid.
---
If you place them instead of just dropping them, they'll go back into your inventory on disconnect 
---
What "went wrong with 76" was the inclusion of PvP in the first place, and lots of people have been saying that as soon as we learned that BGS was putting PvP in.
---
interesting, but i have no mods on my power armour!
---
I would love unsecured storage at camps for dropping off free to other stuff.
---
I would like it even more if I could trap that container to detonate people.
---
Yes they all do
---
The area around Striker Row and the estates always looked kind of neat to me.  The lighting reminds me a lot of Twin Peaks.  Puts me a bit far away from Harper's Ferry, though.
---
I have a SSE, never could figure out that TSE thing either!
---
Honestly the only thing holding pvp back is Armor Piercing. Armor means nothing when you can pierce so much of it. Most Armor Piercing perks or mods could use a bit of a reduction. Looking at you Incisor and Rifle mods. 
---
If the other kids in the vault made friends a deathclaw, would you do it too?
---
I don't know you nor anyone you deal with, but the more you write the less I want to know.
---
I wanted to build beside the Pond at Mack's Farm, but the CAMP beacon can't be placed anywhere near enough to the pond to be able to utilize the water.
---
I assume this is due to the area containing a random spawn location, but I have another characters Camp right beside a random Spawn on another part of the map.
---
I know, I got cocky and thought I would have a few minutes to work on them.
---
I think the Player Vending update will essentially allow you to do this, if that's what you wanted.
---
Had some stuff like this last night n a nuke zone I wonder in and get a team invite from a random. I accept. It's a 40 something and a 76 or so. I'm 120 tanky melee np. I gather the mob and they can tag and bag em, at this point I activate pacifist don't want any accidents.. Next thing I know some peeps come along one has a Tesla rifle zappn the mob. Its nuts to butts glowing ones around me I get a stray arch no sweat. Shit happens he will fix it. Bit then someone literally walks into my axe and collapses into a heap. *I know sounds like a 5 yr old explaining his siblings black eye. He walked into my fist.* But I look down and my two new friends are dead! Well I guess we fighting. Turns out 4 higher level fuck tards tried to bully these guys out since they were "low levels" unaware they had me on their team. Needless to say 20 min later and a cap balance increase of around 2k for me. They ran away and we had the time of our lives in the zone. Lol! My 120 tanky ass and a bunch of sub 50 peeps. 
---
That makes sense. I have only seen one nuke dropped in the past 2 weeks when I have been on and the game crashed before the nuke was done.  I have been clearing out my treasure maps in hope of getting some good plans after a tour through white springs (where I have been dropping off know plans, ammo, and a few legendary items that I don’t want).   Need to find a long time to play so I can launch a nuke myself. 
---
Maybe if a girl wants be to....
---
I don't play Overwatch, but I  thought about her when I wrote this \^\^
---
Gonna have to find one of those... Add it to my TSE Handmade. THEY WILL FEAR MY NAME!
---
I think the amount of high level players that were banned was a very small population of players. Many of my friends that were like me above 100 have left Fallout 76 for other games. To put it bluntly, when you finish all the missions and you're just roaming the wasteland with nothing to do, it can get quite boring. I am one of the few of my friends that have not tossed in the towel up and we've actually found a few ways to keep the game fun, but I admit even finding myself asking if I could be doing something else with my time.
---
I logged in yesterday....was near watoga railyard when screen froze. Logged back in immediately...and found out all 5 of my power armor suits were gone. Left me alot lighter but killed my will to continue playing....level 64
---
I have 3 sets and can always place them in a line and they automatically go back into my inventory.  No reason to drop them unless you're wanting to get rid of them.
---
Just make the new mode there adding the pvp mode and disable pvp on normal servers.
---
Boobytraps could be the "defensive" buff for the Black Hat perk. And I agree, you could leave one of these unsecured storage bins right outside of your store front for donations and charity to anyone that happens through your store or past your camp. A system where you can create these storage containers and choose whether or not to secure them at all has many possibilities, ranging from nefarious all the way up to philanthropic haha.

I was one of those players who targetted weak/unknowledgeable players, but stopped after I got me the xbox achievement. 
---
(Before you ask why would I put myself through this yadayada, getting achievements in videogames is a hobby for me on xbox. I have all achievements in every fallout game released on xbox besides 76 and shelter)
---
The only camps I smash up every rarely now is whitesprings turret bases. Get your own kills you fecking twats, amiright?
---
Don't confuse ignorance with stupidity. There's no shame in not knowing something and trying to find the answer. 
---
Where did you find the gnome in the terminal?
---
I think its random, but weighted towards having one or more of the 3 items (chassis, core, parts).
---
  For example:  Friday night I went to the gorge bridge PA spawn.  PA, Core, and a couple pieces of the armor itself.  
---
Already had the parts, so I meant to take just the core.  Pressed the wrong button, collected the whole suit instead.
---
Went back there Sat afternoon - the suit was there, but it was empty.  Found a Fusion core on a shelf in the side storage room.
---
OTOH, there are 3 other PA spawn sites which on revisit had neither suit nor core.
---
Overall, I think I hit about 75-80% of the time getting a core from a PA respawn location.
---
Jesus...are you me? Same thing yesterday...Exactly the same thing.
---
We're getting a hardcore game mode like that though. 
---
Exploration and actually taking your time with the quests is what I find fun . So I enjoy this game.  The world is very on point with the fallout franchise, without the box interactions of course
---
It'd be nice to keep things open but personally I have trust issues with people. Generally everyone I meet is a friendly player but I'd rather have protection if some shifty wondering player discovers my camp and decides to break things.
---
I have a semi makeshift friendly campsite, like glamping I guess a tent on a wooden platform cozy inside with furnishings and a campfire area outside. Crops behind my tent along with Junk extractor, porta potty and two water purifiers.
---
But then I have a small locked and fortified metal shed behind my crops with 2 machine gun turrets and a rocket turret that I keep my fusion generator, rad shower and three workbenches inside to keep safe. I keep my chemistry workbench inside my tent though for people to use or scrap junk and my power armour station outside the shed on the porch also. 
---
 
---
Can’t confirm, but it likely under floor decor
---
Well, so long as player vending isnt tied to stash, which has not been discussed in any of the releases. If it is not explicitly stated, I would have to imagine it will be a portal into your existing 800lb capacity at your CAMP, merely allowing others to see the items you have tagged and the prices you have tagged them for. But that is of course speculation at this point.
---
Nothing like loading into whitesprings to see every ghoul at level 9 and 14.  
---
&gt;Mines and thrown grenades can be targeted
---
Definitely did not know that. Thanks for the tip.
---
True true...I just hope they force everybody to create a new isolated character for it. It would help keep the playing field a bit more level, at least for a bit
---
While it IS possible, it’s easier when you have a team.
---
In the AMS building outside the glassed cavern. The terminal is on a desk in there. I had 3 scorched beasts flying around overhead and a bunch of scorched trying to have their way with me when I found it. Still had to stop and take a picture.  
---

I think it's a regular part of the game but it needs to happen more often.  
---
It's awesome to see Watoga as a complete warzone.
---
They'll be under your lights tab after you buy them.
---
They are both under the lights tab you will only see 1 then tab over to the next in the menu. Ex right on d pad 
---
Man I love this type of shit.  Someone should make a sub of this sub called Tales of the Wasteland.  Love this game!
---
I would like to see some stats on the number of nukes dropped before the TSE nerf and after. Also would like to see stats of SB Queen kills before the TSE nerf and after.
---
They really should've made TSE weapons do less damage to players only.
---
I just lied dude.
---
Maybe they set the CAMP budget to be as low as possible without complete detriment to creative builds. I hope it was intentional, as a way to test the load on servers and optimize the game as it stays populated. When they announced decorating, it makes me think they've been able to gather enough information to know how much they can comfortably increase the build budget. The lack of density in many areas helps, and optimized loading of local entities helps. There's a lot of little things they could do. Call me an optimist, but all signs point to the budget being increased as they work out the optimization. If the engine wasn't a dinosaur it would help, but to their credit they've done way more with it than anyone expected them to.
---
Ah, that must have been what happened to me the other day. I did one of the power plant events, then went outside and claimed the workshop. Next thing you know, as I'm just looking around the workshop, some guy 50 levels higher than me shows up out of nowhere and kills me in a few shots and takes all my junk. I was wondering why it didn't do the "slap" damage since I don't pvp, but I guess that explains it
---
the weapon select wheel is also my least favorite weapon select system in any fallout - am not a fan.
---
This is where my camp is. I've got the base of the tower walled off with an open concept community garden in the center. Makes a great refuge for those weary from scorchbeast fights!
---
Sometimes you're overencumbered and die before you can reach a stash box though. 
---
Man, I'm so sorry lol
---
You get a card pack every 5 levels. Decide what kind of weapon you want to use and build your perks around that. If you can get armour penetration perks go for it, it is generally better than straight up damage increase. To minimize loot management, I recommend getting some weight management perk cards. As far as specifics, I won’t tell you because finding out what works for own character is half the fun. 
---
My main camp is like this. 
---
Workshop is open but the main house is locked. I built a “servants’ quarters” next to the workshop with toilet, bed and cooking fire, so no filthy wastelander sleeps on my linens or burns down the house because they forgot how a proper stove works. 
---
Use that build planner thingy
---
They still make stuff for the creation club in FO4 and Skyrim. At least they've added stuff pretty recently. 
---
I've had creatures (molerats, dogs, bloat fly's) open my doors when I'm in my camp I think they just can. Does a locked door keep them out? I've seen ghoul NPCs come through locked doors at fort defiance before so I'm not sure how that shit works.
---
...alternate timeline
---
That is exactly what i was trying to avoid!  I have been reading the posts and reviews and didn't want any of that. Thanks for sharing. I like the game, graphics are sometimes just ugly i have to say.

GNOME v.10.2102 Apocalypse Edition
---
I'm confused now.... does the nuke go in the deathclaw or what? Jeez growing up is hard man
---
You could always splurge it early and nuke flatwoods?
---
Blame consoles.
---
The game needs to be identical (in terms of its features) across all platforms and text chat on PS4 and XB1 seems quite impracticable, if not unfeasible.
---
What PC users get is pretty much a port - hence the atrocious UI / key mapping and hence the lack of obvious features other multiplayer online games have.
---
"Why is the network down?" "Gnomes did it."
---
I would so do this! Would be cool to be able to play your own playlists of music too...

It is nice for when using melee weapons.

It's pretty common for themes to be pre order exclusives these days sadly. I have the theme but it's just a static image so you're not missing much. 
---
I actually use the KH1. 5+2.5 pre order theme that's currently not available anymore. 
---
I'm not sure why this is getting vote slammed. 
---
I'm really starting to think people are just afraid of an enemy that isn't a one-shotable, super dumb AI. 
---
Fred the Brahmim is a free beast! Also that requires taking a perk  and I shouldn't have to take a perk to prevent Fred's untimely death every ten minutes.
---
Enemies are often bullet sponges even with the right perks...until you get a good legendary setup. 
---
I use rifles and shotguns with cripple to slow them and put them on the ground. Then it’s just a matter of enough execution shots to the dome.
---
Keep in mind, you can change specials after level 50. But, it can be a long tedious process. Switching from melee to rifles could take twenty level. Between changes to special and getting new perk cards. Also remember that some cards you only use when bargaining, crafting, or lock picking. So you might not have to put 6 into a special stat, 3 might work instead. Personally I think lone wanderer is one of the best early game cards....

Without proper beforehand communication, Launching a Nuke with friends can lead to awkward situations.   No one enjoys a surprise Nuke launching.

Owning a workshop yourself, being on a team with someone owning a workshop, splash damage from explosive weapons and finally, being wanted all activate pvp. I too complained a while back about getting owned whilst not engaging pvp. Turns out i was wrong, i had been in one of those scenarios every time.
---
I tested my bloodied powerfist on a level 6 that didn't engage. He allowed me to do it for caps and to claim my wanted bounty after it. It took 48 hits on him, without him engaging to kill him. My powerfist was doing 1800 damage each hit. 
---
You must've been engaged in pvp mate. 
---
&gt;[Edit, ooh, just noticed I don't need to bulk to sell these... doh. :) ]
---
Ya.  Those junk items you can't Bulk already have value while loose.  And depending on your Charisma and Hard Bargain perk net you 1-2 caps _each_.  They are nice and easy vendor fodder.  Bulking just lets you sell those 0 Cap Value junk items to vendors.  (Sometimes for a pretty penny).
---
Low level quests direct players to Whitesprings.  If the mobs are low level when you get there, clear the area and wait for the desired levels to spawn.
---
I believe it’s simply a rare drop from any event or quest which drops plans. The only guaranteed under armor drops are from Overseer’s stashes but that’s for the vault suit.
---
You can trust me 😏
---
Wait really? Didn't know that 
---
Sounds like a great way to grief bloodied builds.... There is 0 for a medic character ATM.
---
PVP in 76 is just lunatics walking into trading post start shooting for no reason.  Most of the time, when you are at stations checking your stash, those melee sociopaths will run to chop you. For what!?

yep i love it when that happens, kind of nice to get level 1 legendaries for alt characters to use.

I got the disc with steel box for $20 on eBay, I tried it on Redbox for about $5 first. It’s cheap as hell, some people were selling it for $3. If anyone is interested in Fallout 76, go online and buy it, even the most expensive editions are drastically brought down

I will try get the link for you

How do you even get such thing ? Is this new ? I haven't played the game in quite a long time.

I kinda wish there was a banking system where I could have interest on caps if I put them in a bank

I've seen him, too.    His corpse was with an albino deathclaw that was fighting scorched north of Watoga..    It may be some sort of broken event.                                                
---
Don't worry, level 102 and still a #nukevirgin. If youre on PC I'll help you pop your cherry, if you pop mine.
---
Good story!  Have had a couple of "Whitespring" incidents myself. As a tanky melee build myself, I can relate.  Usually run pacifist in the The Whitespring to avoid friendly fire,  but my reactive plates can set off a pvp scenario anyway, so now I just am in pvp mode all the time just in case.  Those looking for it will find it anyway.
---
I had a funny interaction yesterday with someone that built a turret farm behind WSGC. 
---
I hopped on top of the roof of the clubhouse and the owner sat there and gave me the thumbs up emote.  I didnt respond.  I hopped down and closed the back doors.  He comes down and opens them.  This went back and forth for about 30 seconds.  Finally, I give him the thumbs down emote and hop back on top of the roof of the clubhouse.  Launched an orbital strike.   He gives me the question mark emote, and I respond with thumbs up emote.  Problem solved!! 
---
I’m not a flamethrower kinda guy I was just responding to OP.
---
Yes, on PC, about 16 hours ago. And they kept spawning over and over. I looted 15 items off them:
---
**Armor**
---
	`Unyielding` x 2
---
	`Mutant slayer's` x 1
---
	`Life saving` x 1
---
**Melee**
---
	`Stalker's` x 1
---
	`Anti-armor` x 1
---
**Ranged**
---
	`Nocturnal` x 2
---
	`Two-shot` x 1
---
	`Suppressor's` x 1
---
	`Quad` x 1
---
	`Hunter's` x 1
---
	`Berserker's` x 1
---
	`Assassin's` x 1
---
If it's a workshop assault it's not griefing but a "game mechanic"... idk
---
In events you can not damage other players.  Not sure how long its been like this but for a while now you cant pvp against or damage other players in the same event 
---
So the packs every 5 levels carry on indefinitely?
---
And okay thank you! Given me a lot to think about for sure!
---
So trying to get a mix between utility and damage would be ideal for a solo player like myself then?
---
Also are pistols/revolvers really as weak as people say? 
---
Cheers for the offer but I’m Xbox I’m afraid, thinking of making a couple decent weapons on my main and giving them to me and my friend to keep us going for a few levels, really appreciate the offer though!
---
Next time just place to move stuff around, it sucks but you wont risk the loss. That being said whatcha lose? I have some spare sets of ultracite and excavator if you need one. PC
---
Never mind, I located them.   They were not there before I restarted my game but after I did so, they showed up under "lights"  Leaving this up there for anyone else who has the same issue. 
---
Edit to add link.
---
Really just beds, an instrument, a weapon workbench, and a stash box. Just what you need to clear WS
---
Oh okay! I was looking at lone wanderer. Are the bonuses really noticeable then? 
---
two bullets per trigger pull with a touch of explosives 👀
---
Yep there is a way: go to the devs from Fo76, show them how stupid they are that a weapon brakes after a minute (most every engergy based weapon does that) punch them in the face and scream in her  faces: GIVE THAT DAM WEAPONS A HIGHER DURATION NUMBER OR DECREASE THE FUCKING DMG THAT THE WEAPON TAKES AFTER ITS FIRED \`;..;´ 
---
THAT and only THAT will do it because they are totaly ignorant, didnt play the game, balancing wtf is that? so they are idiots who are unable to use there brains to change some f\*cking numbers... NUMBERS BETHESDA!!! I DONT NEED TO BE A PROGRAMMER TO KNOW HOW TO BALANCE THE WEAPONS -.-
---
sry im a flamer lover and cant reliable use them because of THAT -,-
---
Thanks buddy! 
---
Generally, the junk weight reduction perk in Strength - Pack Rat - is pretty useful for any build. It reduces the weight of junk up to 75 percent. Even if you're not going to run melee as your primary weapon, you should take a couple of those perks, because you will need to melee from time to time. (Feral ghouls obviously charge you, along with most of the creatures in the game.)
---
The Luck tree has a bunch a miscellaneous, useful perks, but some of them aren't available until later levels - Super Duper (up to a 30 percent chance to get double items when crafting), Class Freak (reduces harmful effects of mutations up to 75 percent), Starched Genes (mutations aren't removed by radaway). Still, it is useful to have some points in Luck, because even the lower level cards are very useful, like the ones that let you "search" medical boxes for extra supplies.
---
After that, as others have said, a lot relies on your playstyle and what you want to do. I like to snipe and lurk in stealth, so I stick to hunting rifles and lever action rifles with silencers. The perk cards for those are in Perception and Agility. 
---
Also, don't be intimated by people saying you -have- to play the game one way or the other. Yes, there are builds that are better than others, but unless you pursue some really weird strategy ("I'm only using combat knives!!!"), you should still be able to get through the main story and most of the events. 
---
I want to see this. Because to be quite honest it's simply not true.  You CAN be killed by slap damage.  
---
I was out near my camp (in a semi-isolated area) chatting with my friend.  I'm level 100.  Two players around level 150 come around sneaking.  One of them starts attacking me with melee. He was clearly doing stupid OP bloodied nerd rage melee build.  He starts whacking me taking modest chunks of health at a time. I was relatively low in health to begin with because oddly enough I was testing a bloodied build. 
---
I NEVER ENGAGED HIM and was obviously not at a workshop.  He continuously attacked me and kept trying to kill me. I tried running away, whilst stimpak healing.  I went into my base. And both started to destroy my base. I logged out to avoid complete destruction.  
---
He absolutely would have killed me if I just stood there. 
---
Nah. 
---
The limits exist for a reason.
---
Bird bones? 2 of them?
---
This is a build that revolves around having really high rads. The perks that you would want for a build like this is all around low health, like Nerd Rage, if your rads are high, then perks like that will always be active.
---

---
Let. Go. 
---
I started out going rifleman and still use excavator armor and am level 88 now.  I did incorporate a couple cards towards 2-handed melee weapons to save on ammo when facing hoards of ghouls or scorched, up close and personal.  Getting tank killer x3 really helps against super mutants.
---
That would be pretty much useless. They don't weigh anything or take up space in any way.
---
The core is not depleted, it's a bug that loads the amount of ammo equal to the cores you have in storage. So if you have 7 cores it loads 7 ammo in it. If you reload or use those shots it loads the proper core. 
---
I think I got the plans as a reward for doing Enclave quests. 
---
Don't spend them then. 
---
Did you try turning it off and then on again?
---
You will always remember your first time, the exhilaration of the launch ;)
---
Okay thanks man I was using melee abit too, really your setup seems exactly how I want mine too b, with a lot of riflemen Power Armor and melee now and then, what’s your perk stats like ?
---
That is super nice of you to offer, thank you, but I'm on Xbox. I'm  just gonna grind I guess until I can at least get my Excavator back, I practically lived in it.
---
Repeatedly. I even nuked it from orbit.
---
Yea I’m really only using the term “griefer” because some people will only attack a workshop if it’s someone significantly weaker than them. 
---
I don’t really have anything against those who attack workshops in general.
---
By the time I hit level 60 I'd finished all the quests and explored the whole map. I'm just waiting for more content before I come back.
---
SO you got a lvl 1 berserker weapon? wanna sell that to me?!
---
The perk cards are given out every 5 levels forever, yep. 
---
If you  are a heavy PVP focused player you will want your end game loadout to be pretty focused on damage and things. But while you are building your character and just playing the game, it’s definitely smart to have a balance. You won’t get away with carrying a lot of food/healing/junk items if you don’t have something to lower their weight. You can also lower some weapons class weights. Pistols are pretty weak. But the trade off is that they can fire fast and don’t cost a lot of AP. So someone using vats with the right perks could do decently. 
---
Try and stayed crouched or [HIDDEN] when you have workshops or are at your camp, it keeps you off the map and makes you less of a target for people forcing pvp through workshops or players griefing your camp after noticing you stationary for awhile.
---
If they cant find you, they cant attack you.
---
Lol, same with my first trip. I was level 25 or so and got swarmed walking up to the clubhouse; even had a glowing ghoul in the mix.  I didn't have the nerve to come back until after level 60.
---
Muito bom nome.

This is a great idea and all, but we need some way to communicate in-game. If the survey is in-game 100% of players will see it. No emails, no forums, no reddit. They could even give us 10 atoms for filling it out to entice more people to engage. 
---
Maybe I'm just cynical, but I don't see them implementing anything like this. 
---
I think a bank is kinda pointless unless a lot of players are reporting going over the caps limit, or they’re losing too many caps through bounties.
---
If you are generating fewer caps try bulking your junk and sell what you don’t need. I find this super helpful. If you’re finding it hard to save caps, think how you’re spending them. Try not to buy ammo or other items that you can craft yourself or find around the map (eg stimpacks and bloodpacks). 
---
Caps are fairly easy to obtain by just selling weapons instead of scrapping, selling outfits and aid items - and of course, bulking.
---
The only way to be sure. 
---
Those legendaries have gotta start somewhere I guess lol 
---
Sorry, I threw them all away instantly, for [scientific purposes](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/avbgc4/loot_drop_chances_roundup_february_27/) of course.
---
Lost my All Rise last week. . . I'm assuming I vendored it, even though I had it favorited, and have yet to accidentally vendor a favorited item. So I'm kinda 50/50 on whether it just disappeared, or if I did vendor it.
---
Good advice! I'll try to remember that next time.
---
Oh then what is it?
---
On xb1 I see this pretty frequently on the map but no one around. I have never triggered one of the missions either 
---
The extra 100 weight is a bug when you load into the world. It isn't the actually carry eight you should have. 
---
I've got the veil of mysteries and voice of set. You can have them for a handful of aluminum if you want them. I'm on PS4 btw.
---
I just want an inventory setup like pubg. Being able to loot an area and multiple enemies at once would be amazing. This would help when enemies die under flora and are inaccessible to loot. 
---
I suggest the crafting ones for the type you are pursuing and quality of life ones that reduce your personal time. Stuff that would reduce breakage lead belly to eventually eliminate rads from food etc.  You should level pretty quickly to get the perks you need.
---
Did you not see the massive roadmap they have? 
---
The game scales enemies’ levels based on the highest level player in the location/area. The Whitespring happens to be one of the most popular places for high level players to grind for legendary gear/experience, so the enemies there will typically be high level as well.
---
The 410 is a bug, the Excavator bonus of +100 gets doubled if you log out while inside the armor.  And it stays doubled until you get out and get back in.
---
Get Calibrated Shock mods for your armor, it gives +50 per leg.  Also Motion-Assist servo for the Torso gives +2 STR which is +10 Carry Weight.
---
Deep Pocketed mods for your normal armor will give +10 per piece (+50 total for all 5 pieces) which is nice to have when doing normal stuff.
---
The hunger part of speed demon is a nuisance but worth it. I too tend towards lever action, so it is nice. 
---
I'm running marsupial, speed demon, grounded and healing factor and I'm loving that combo. I'll likely add more but weighing it all up at the moment.
---
Only real downside is you get too used to them! If I forget and take radx it's a pain and my second character has no mutations as yet, so it's odd when I switch character. 
---
The same thing happened to mine.  I tamed a mirelurk hunter and logged out at my camp, the next time I logged in he was a searchable corpse in front of my house with no enemies around.  Tried re-logging multiple times but he never came back.  I'm sorry this isn't much help since I also have no explanation, but know you're not alone.  Wish I knew what caused it!  
---
SEE! SEE! Told you I hadn't been drinking again Ma!
---
I would want to save caps jus to stock up on caps it sucks being at max caps and having to buy something even if u dnt want it but jus so u can  sell some things. Thats the only reason.
---
Really! That is good to know. Thanks
---
I'm sorry but that made me cry. I guess it struck a cord. Well done my friend!

That was excellent.  I also think the flooding of Charleston did not have enough backstory and holotapes of people buried alive.

I bought the fusion generator plan from Graham. 
---
It did not show under notes, as either known or unknown, or any other place in my inventory that I cound find.  
---
When I finally made it back to camp and entered build mode, the fusion generator was there.
---
I have only ever known it as the Three Second Ejaculator
---
yeah, i play on both pc and xbox, usually there seems to be no one around, but this days a lot of players are sneaking to avoid grifers, so not easy to actually know :/
---
But i see the same on both platforms, less and  less of them, juts for a test right now i server hop'ed 4 times, none of them showed up, but the messenger and events like that is always there..
---
The farther south and east you go, the higher the difficulty ramps up in general. 
---
But if you just want to complete a certain quest or something, just run to and unlock a new location and if the enemies are too high, quit to main menu and then continue the game. Eventually you’ll be on a server where there’s nobody else around and you can have your way with the bad guys. 
---
You can also join up with some friends that are higher level to help out, or if single player is your thing, grind it out a bit in the forest. Do some events etc for experience and goodies. 
---
It'd be useful for clearing the mobs that show up during the SBQ fight, but make a poor all-purpose weapon. It does +50% damage to Scorched, but -20% damage to everything else, and IIRC, Scorchbeasts (including the Queen) don't count as Scorched (They spread the disease and control its victims, but aren't infected with it themselves).

Doesn't it only affect the condition of a weapon or armor?
---
Hey! I'm new as well (first fallout game) and on XB1. If you want to team up, I'm happy to join with you. I am only level 8 and really just trying to learn the basics.

Usually on 9pm EST ish

This happened to me yesterday after a nuke expired on White Spring on PS4. The club house spawned in as a hoard of level  legendary eye bots before then glitching out and failing to respawn any enemies for the remainder of my time on that server (maybe 6 hours?). We had numerous people login at the club house to force respawn and nothing ever came out of after the eye bots were killed. The other cabins and parking lot seemed to be spawning as expected. 
---
here you go 👍 https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks  
---
Oh... Well... That sucks...
---
Stop nuking the queen, she sucks. 
---
Yes! This would be a great way around the caps limit. Allow us to STASH at least 25k. Please Bethesda.  u/Valseek  u/Lady Devan
---
You state you were not at a workshop.  But did you or anyone in your party have a workshop claimed?
---
Happy to help
---
It is pretty shit and people been calling out for a fix for a long time.
---
Apparently distilling and brewing is more important #BethesdaLogic
---
I get what you're saying, but I don't get to play the game enough to make finding each piece before making a run a viable option.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aw9z88/psa_slap_damage_results_of_an_extensive_although/
---
Or you can just wait outside of whitesprings and ask someone to help you out.  I've  been asked several times to help in this quest and always happy to oblige.
---
I beleive it is a food item unto itself, very low spoilage rate, and also a very low percentage chance of disease. (like 2%).
---
Pretty much the same as honey IRL.
---
Weight is the number one enemy in this game. So Traveling Pharmacy (Strength) and Thru-Hiker (Agility) are must-haves. Then the rest is build dependent. The next must-have is either Gunsmith or Makeshift Warrior in Intelligence. Later on you'll want Class Freak and Starched Genes in Luck when you start getting in to Mutations. 
---
Fast travel to vault 76, log out.
---
No risk of nuke upon entering!
---
Easy solution. 
---
Wha- No! The End! From MGS 3! The sniper you have a half hour boss battle with!
---
It sounds like adrenal has been reworked when and how strong it effects damage, from most people it seems like it is working, even though the positive effect isnt listed.
---
The biggest kicker though, if you do the remove + re apply method, the serum used must have been made post patch. Any Adrenal serum made pre patch will not imbue the new effects and are dud items at the moment.
---
You need to use a serum created since the last patch to get the new effects.
---
Once in the bunker look at the white boards. Pick one that you think you might be able to solve. It will be missing letters but it might make sense or be easy to figure out. Then head over to the red terminals and start selecting the corresponding missions to get the 8 officers. Takes about 30 minutes to get all eight by traveling back to the bunker to start the mission over for each one. Then a few minutes to figure out your code.  
---
I'm at lvl 153 and solo nuke every day. But I am getting bored because there is nothing else to do/collect. Vendor cap has limit, pocket cap has limit and even stash weight has limit. Maybe I will quit within a week as well.
---
Ah that makes sense, thank you all!
---
I just think it's annoying as hell when you have these Bethesda Fanboys trolling around in here using the excuse that we should have known the game would be like this. They told us that there would be PVP. As if we had any say in the game whatsoever. We were asking for another great Fallout game, but we got this PVP trash we're annoying 10 year olds can come on and just ruin your play experience and it's our fault because we don't like it. Lmfao the nerve of some people
---
If you die...you lose your level as the total Caps lost.
---
E.G.
---
Die at level 83 from a player and they will get 83caps from you.
---
Mine works fine apart from with Strange in Numbers. Ignore the mutation tooltip and just look at your weapon damage.
---
I always log out for the day at my Camp, away from normal Nuke Locations.
---
If I happen to be server hopping at the Bunker for X01 mods, I put my Hazmat Suit on, or my PA, before doing so.  Just in case I login in a nuke zone and it's all radded to hell.
---
"Leslie, I typed your symptoms into the thing up here and it says you could have 'network connectivity problems'."
---
You could have it alter the ammo that the Syringer uses and introduce a new ammo type that requires stimpacks to craft.
---
I'm not sure why they changed how the ammo worked in the first place. They should probably just go back to the way the syringer worked in Fallout 4 where you equip an ammo and the effect is determined by the ammo type you use. That would allow for far more interesting mechanics in general.
---
No they don't have hardware problems, they are just using the most cut rate, cheapest server configuration options. Amazon AWS servers are incredibly while performing. But there's a performance threshold. They are clearly not paying for a decent server experience. Are you going to tell me that it's Amazon's fault that the game always crashes and that it's still laggy when there is a nuke? Nope. They are using extremely cheap service levels. There are service level agreements that Amazon has the honor. But if Bethesda is paying for less than what we need to actually play the game efficiently or without problems, then that's not Amazon's fault.
---
According to this sub, any non-consensual pvp interactions are griefing.
---
Someone shot at you? Toxic griefer.
---
Someone tried to take your workshop? Hateful nasty toxic griefing scumbag.
---
Someone damaged your camp? griefing asshole.
---
Yea, except OP and many others were likly in your exact same position, then they came here to complain and spread misinformation because they don't understand PVP mechanics.
---
Exactly what I said in my post. Another person that comes in here and tells people to stop bitching because they have any sort of complained about the game. Thank you for proving my point
---
Where did you find this?
---
Oh man that sucks!! I saw a lvl50 All Rise at the Watoga vendor recently, keep checking there or on reddit, people still them sometimes.
---
I just wish we could make a minefield, but it seems we are limited to laying down only 2 mines at at time&gt;?
---
Pro tip: Workshops are fairly useless, don't waste your time. If you need mats, learn good routes and farm/server hop. You can get more in 15 minutes of farming than 3 hours of a workshop.
---
Thank you! Given me a lot to think about as my weight must be from food and chems really!
---
I know it's a long way off, but what beneficial mutations are there? 
---
Well, the fusion generator does have an irritation whine, but it's probably a lot quieter and less smokey than a diesel.  :)
---
Didn't realise lead belly 3* removed rads! Will defo look Into specing that! 
---
good idea but it would kind if make the Medic legendaries useless/
---
Yup, figured that's my best bet too. I'll be keeping my eyes peeled. Would've much rather it had been my Ski Sword that had vanished, as I only use that for trash mobs in low lvl areas when scavenging. 
---
That would not solve the other issue mentioned. Don't fight without power armor or hazmat suit then?
---
I suppose there's a workaround or mod for every issue - thereby endorsing slipshod game design. 
---
Even in the Fallout universe they have Google Gnome..
---
I saw this happen at the Watoga train station yesterday to a player.  I just thought they had lost connection, but they were there for a while trying to move.
---
But they can’t crit and crits ignore damage mitigation. You can tank a few manual shots with the right gear, mutations, and perks
---
Yeah I seriously think it has one of the best maps of all the games. Varied and interesting locations.
---
Really a shame people don't even look into the game and call it trash in every area. Because the map definitely isn't one of them.
---
Yep, could not agree more!  Play the game and the XP will follow.  There is no need to rush the process.
---
That's incredible 
---
I mean, you should have gnome this was gonna be there. 
---
What? That's not answering the question I asked so I have no idea what your talking about 
---
I have a "themed" character that uses Max Luck and I think has 7 in Charisma.  The only thing that has been affected on my drops is the condition of the weapon or armor.  It can sometimes be 200% of normal, but it does not appear to affect drops in any other way.
---
Yes, I'm calling to log a fault.. The cup holder on my PC is broken!
---
PvP is pretty fun once its made of two groups that cooperate to destroy each other and if all of them are decently geared, perked and specced.
---
If, on the other hand, a player that has stacked all damage boosts shoots a player that have not stacked any defensive boosts, its easy to come to conclusion that PvP is completely unbalanced, when in reality its not.
---
The truth is, frankly, that the people who just want to chill a lil in the evening will never have satisfying PvP interactions with those who researched the game and traded for hundreds of hours to complete their characters. From this perspective, from a player that would prefer the game to be open PvP with no pacifist mode and no slap damage, I fully support the premise of this request. There should be a PvE only mode, so that the people who want to PvP will only be able to participate in it with consenting adversaries, not the random dude who thinks on how to rearrange plants in his CAMP.
---
You gained positive Karma - you can now Join the Regulators!
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Regulator\_(Fallout\_3)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Regulator_(Fallout_3))
---
Add friends and team up for these events.
---
You can Usually choose to respawn in other locations. Vault 76 etc EXCEPT when you're overt encumbered. 
---
You choose where to respawn. Again. The choice being yours. 
---
The end zone is always lower than you expect it to be. Don’t just stick it where Fissure site Prime is, but a little lower and to the right. 
---
Awww :( 
---
Thank you for the input! I was thinking of going more of a manual build, rifles and revolvers.
---
How are you finding the level action vs hunting rifle? 
---
No prob I used to have a very active community, so my community resource account has several excavator and ultracite that could go to a good home XD
---
Yes I know they do, but those games were not designed to be ran with persistent servers.
---
Take Elder scrolls online for example,  a game based on a framework with a huge supported mod community.  As far as I know they do not have private servers. 
---
Thank you! A lot to try and figure out then! Thanks for the heads up about pistols! 
---
Thanks! I though I had seen it before but it’s been a long time since I have gone in the building. 
---
That's sort of a loaded question, because different play styles will value different cards as key to their build.  
---
To preface, I'd suggest picking a weapon style to specialize in and not generalize.  Your effective damage increases dramatically when you start stacking damage related perks and possibly mutations and legendary weapon effects on top of all that.  If you opt for shotguns, for example, a 15% damage bonus from Bloody Mess is going to coordinate with 9 ranks of shotgunner, plus the damage boost from various legendary weapon effects such as two-shot, mutants or instigating.
---
I guess I'd say that super duper, bloody mess, picklock, hacker, aquaboy/girl, good doggy, dromedary, glow sight, hard bargain, travel agent, ammosmith, chemist, fix it good and weapon artisan benefit any character or playstyle, so they're good perks to have.  If you plan on acquiring mutations, starched genes is required, and at least a couple ranks of class freak is a good idea.  
---
Having some weight reducing perks to swap in for fast traveling is always nice.  You can cut your weight down significantly, but I tend to swap them out for offensive/defensive perks while engaging in combat.  I'm also not a hoarder, so I usually become overencumbered during a nuke site.  Traveling Pharmacy and Thru Hiker are the most useful for me.
---
On a whim, I swapped in a Gun Runner that I got from a level up pack on my power armor melee character who has three cards invested in a backup pistol ranged option.  I wouldn't play without it now.  I ranked it up to the two star max, and swap to my pistol when I'm not actively fighting.  So useful, but only for a build that uses pistols at least part-time.
---
I think it's supposed to just be a rare encounter that's amusing to run across.  We've got Graham, why not an intelligent Deathclaw merchant?  I think he should be wearing a big assed gray robe though with his tale sticking out.
---
Since it's for landing SBQ and possibly other SBs, I would suggest a shotgun with limb damage and Anti-armor, pick up the Enforcer perk. Make sure you try to clip the wings
---
I wish after a certain high, high (50 -100) level you could unlock master perk cards that did not take up multiple slots.
---
When fighting the queen, you automatically respawn, without choice of location.
---
Events like that are mainly based on how good the workshop is. Workshops with large benefits tend to have more enemies while workshops with little benefit usually have lower level enemies. There are a few exceptions that are really dumb though. Sometimes there will be high level in low benefit and low level in high benefit. In other words, it's completely random.
---
I can carry more with an Unyielding set than I can with an unbugged PA
---
Hmm ok thanks I appreciate the help 
---
What I want to know is why if we're wearing goggles, sunglasses, welding helmet etc why we're so blinded when going from inside a building to outside.  I want some freaking functional shades!!!!
---
I'm a lumberjack boxer with drinking problems, anti social behavior, and a suicidal death wish. 
---
It wouldn't. How much time would you need to recreate full combat preparedness? Because I work in a PvP oriented group and I think its around three days until we can win against sentinel builds and dominate everybody around, except there are no sentinel builds yet so we'd dominate even harder.
---
There really is no need to lose anything if the game mechanics allowed for reasonable vendor activity including a consistent supply of ballistic fibre and adhesive and a consistent cap supply.  There's just too much weirdness going on (still, after three months) . . . stash missing from camp, stash missing from Red Rocket, stash "conflict" when two or more players show up at a Train Station, items appear and disappear from inventory.  I don't consider trying insure the ability to repair weapons and armour "living dangerously" . . . unless there's a "hidden agenda" which works towards reducing inventory.  In case you haven't noticed, the locations that have stash boxes AND repair stations get a lot sparser in the dangerous parts of the map.
---
The first content update is coming on March 12th.  It will add new missions and a distilling crafting bench to make drinks!
---
It's a gnome
---
That junkyard is in the Ash Heap technically and is a higher level area.
---
Always scrap weapons, learn mods and acquire / rebuild weapons with a higher level to maximize your damage dealt. 
---
Also realize when taking over a workshop in a higher level to stash your junk as death lacks consequence and you can brute force your way through death respawn loops.
---
Also at level 25 you can wear raider power armor, it can help you survive better.
---
They fixed reactive plates now. It doesn't hit back if in pacifist. I'm a bit saddened they changed it, was always fun when them dick heads show up with their bloody melee builds and kill themselves. Only down side is I would end up with a bounty. They should have left it the way it was but removed the bounty part for the defending player.
---
it does only affect condition.
---
havent logged in in over 2 weeks..nothing to do, and friend list was always blank as they too no longer log in...  
---
we are all going to the new everquest tlp server that opens up in a few days..tells ya how interested we are in fallout 76...
---
PC only - they would be in the Bethesda launcher.
---
The incentive was that he is poor and he got this game for free.
---
Marsupial is a must-have. Jumping super high lets you get around the map much easier. Also lets you cheese some melee enemies. 
---
Speed Demon is great. Moving and reloading faster is always good. 
---
The rest is build dependent: 
---
Melee = Twisted Muscles (or go Talons instead if you're going Unarmed weapons). 
---
Ranged = Eagle Eyes. And Bird Bones is nice if you're using VATS. 
---
And if you dislike the survival mechanics of eating, you can go either Carnivore or Herbivore and that will allow you to eat uncooked food. 
---
Electrically Charged and Unstable Isotope are also universally good because having a chance to deal automatic damage to melee attackers is good. 
---
Content wise. How do people play this game for 800 plus hours... I think that excludes some people. Me trying to make my purpose hear clear is okay.
---
Well then! Nuke not well placed. You can plonk your nuke down and still respawn safe if it's done right.
---
I'll need to check later on the respawn thing. Was pretty sure you could still spawn elsewhere
---
Sounds like a good idea, as shotgun perks are strength based. What would you use to do damage then? My bloodied switchblade +SP us a nifty tool, but the queens damage mitigation makes it pretty useless. Also, what about the damage dropoff on shotguns? Isn't that an issue here?
---
I didn't know this was a thing. I have that quest to do but haven't started it yet. I'm level 71. So they're not likely to spawn?
---
I'd be interested to hear more about this as well, I swear when i run solo whitesprings i only get so many legendaries to spawn, but when i play with my friend who has very high luck plus uses the luck boosting alcohol perk card, we get TONS of legendaries to appear
---
Damage barrels are 100% useless past level 10. Takes 2 shots from a Radscorpion barrel to kill anything past a level 5 scorched. Lots of enemies are also immune to poison damage so you can't even try to kill robots.  Radscorpions don't spawn below level 14 so farming for them requires a weapon better than what you're going to get.
---
DoTs in 76 just refresh, they don't stack so you can't buff reload speed to pump damage up. Nothing buffs DoT damage, only the 5 damage from the shot. No crits, no Rifle perks, no Nerd Rage, no Adrenal, nada. You can't even craft a longer barrel onto the damage barrels so you're stuck using it at mid range.
---
 I killed one in the Glass Caverns and got a point for the Enclave officer quest. ;)
---
You must love Nuclear Mines... I know I do!
---
Dude I got attacked by 2 dudes that kept following me and beating the shit out of me if it wasn't for stimpacks they would have killed me and took all my junk. And I run passive 24/7, its bullshit plain and simple.
---
2-7 at camden.  (2 for the challenge, 2 in an ammo box, 1 at the PA spawn, 1 the power unit, and 1 with the vendorbot.  
---
Get the gorge bridge key while you are there.  Key gives access to another PA spawn point. 
---
On the roof of the nuka cola plant.
---
Almost always 1 on the table at Posiedon.  More if someone powered the plant, then left the server.
---
All the usual PA spawn points.
---
1 at widows peak.
---
You'll lay also want the perk thatll reduce their weight... batteries included, I think.
---
You could make heavy weapons work if you’re ok switching perks quickly. But honestly I’d just stick to killing adds until the queen lands
---
yup i ve seen animals open doors before, kinda funny, kinda scary...
---
I feel like I would make more mistakes if I could just spam the button. It's annoying but it makes me think. Sometimes I think there's one more menu to back out of but there isn't. 
---
They are the single fastest way to get workshop plans that I know of.
---
TeHScanman lvl 32... I could really use some help making my 30 or 35 armor and some Guidance. I can just look up how to complete quests if I'm lost but I need some realworld/player experience to continue from where I am... 
---
I find this happens with random objects, the first time was the tables in Helvetia for me. Usually the objects that sit on them are still there, but floating. It’s just the assets that have failed to load.
---
If you can aim your reticule through an open window of the locked house to select a crafting table/resource box/etc etc you can glitch through the locked door, fyi
---
Go to the Bethesda.net launcher.  Hit the &gt;&gt; button and they should be there.
---
A work around is whilst in a building, go into third person view and also have your weapon out.
---
Yeah, I thought that was interesting too, particularly since so many other perks that don't work in power armor are reasonably well labeled about saying so. 
---
Not the same as fighting the Queen, but the other day I came "home" to fint a Scorchbeast fighting some Mole Miners at a nearby location. I didn't want the beastie to go for my camp next, so I waded in with my trusty Gatling with which I've killed Scorchbeasts before. 
---
I was dismayed to find that I was only shaving off the smallest hint of that big health bar. I've downed Scorchbeasts with only half a mag at times, but this time I spent a full mag on taking off about a fifth of its health. I was lvl 72, the beastie was lvl 50. At that point I just logged out. 
---
I guess I'm back to where server-hopping is my best option again when being attacked by Scorchbeasts. 
---
Oh shoot I just bought it a few days ago. I’ll have to find out. If the good effects aren’t listed how can we tell it’s working?
---
Oh, I thought you were only using it to make her land. Anti-armor should help you get through to her. Also Enforcer isn't affected by damage drop off, though increased limb damage may be
---
I cleared all my mutations this patch to get rid of grounded and fix aderenal, I've have no problems with aderenal since the reapply the only problem that breaks it now is Strange in Numbers.
---
What if you don't have the caps to lose? 
---
No, I haven't been suspended or anything like that.  It's just an error that keeps happening since the last patch. 
---
Careful w/ your mutations and PA adds. If you’re mirroring back damage, you’re likely getting flagged as fighting back ...
---
This might be what happened. Turns out I can craft it now! I was just mighty surprised to not see it appear in my inventory. At least I can take comfort in knowing that my caps actually went into what I wanted. Thank you for your input! Could it be a new behavior of the game that just appeared recently?
---
And the error message is the title of this post. 
---
I have read that you get a timed ‘de-buff to special point’ but I myself have not confirmed this
---
Oh yeah, forgot about healing factor. That one is nice as I can greatly reduce the amount of stimpaks I carry so I can just carry more junk. That one is finicky for met though. Ive read it isnt supposed to work under combat/caution but sometimes it does for me and other times it doesnt and need to hit a stimpak. 
---
Sent you a FR
---
Fantastic Idea! 
---
I hope they implement something like this. I think being a medic would be amazing.
---
While I sincerely appreciate our dialogue, I oppose allocating the onus to the user. This may due to my age or my profession as a developer. Giving the user the best experience possible is a trademark of good design. 
---
While there are always workarounds, most players value QoL improvements - and that's all this post is about.
---
No worries.  If you ever want to drop nukes hit me up my PSN is Capta1nmustard.
---
What are you trying to make? 
---
What is what? My disability? You seriously expect me to just tell you something personal like that in a public forum otherwise my disability isn't real? That what you gonna try to pull? Because if so, then yeah you probably do expect those in a wheelchair to have other carry them up stairs instead of having the store accommodate the ADA.
---
I will proceed to do both, I will go on PvP servers to go kill people and I will also go to PvE servers to kill people who take workshops. 
---
It may be mere coincidence, but when I team with a friend who has high charisma, I get much better drops. I had my first explosive hunting rifle drop one of the first times we teamed followed quickly by an explosive western. Given I hadn’t seen an explosive anything in probably 75 levels, getting two in the same Westek run seemed something more than coincidence. But of course I may be reading too much into it. 
---
Stop lying his game is trash and the world is trash
---
And you got GNOOOOOMED!
---
^^END ^^ME
---
Charleston Junk yard is in the ash heap and has a high range of mobs. There was probably a higher level player near the junk yard that set the stage for the level of the event mobs. If you had been in the workshop at the time the event proc'd it would have been lower level mobs.
---
Correct me if I’m wrong but the armor mods don’t work if you are in PA, so if you have 5 deep pocketed armor pieces it only works outside of PA right?
---
My camp is always open, and is located close to a road for easy access by other players. I have two garage doors, with a full workshop inside for anyone to use. The rest of my home is on the floors above, and while its still a work in progress, anyone is welcome to check it out....there's even a guest room off the kitchen if you need to rest.
---
I don't worry about griefers. If someone is going to flatten my camp, I'll just relocate it 2 inches to the left. I do worry about the random super mutants and scorched who shoot my generator shed from a half mile away...they hate that thing sooooo much.
---
Thank you for taking the time to reply. AA and shotguns it is then.
---
Post a call out? “Need group for a nuke launch....” My group did it last night and the amount of voices popping into chat broke it! It was fun as heck. And knowing most of the names on the battlefield for that queen fights was one of the best parts. (Xbox player)
---
BUGTHESDA... nuf said
---
Keep up the good content, Sinister :)
---
I didn't mean it to be loaded, as I'm not trying to follow a "build", but then again I didnt want to invest into a perk that has been nerfed or something of the sort.
---
The idea of swapping weight perks in and out wasn't something that crossed my mind, so thank you for that indeed!
---
Lots to think on. Thanks again! 
---
I hope they implement a perk manager at some point. The mod available requires dome recompiling, not to sure if that's OK with then anti-cheat.
---
Meh.
---
The game already gives you a bunch of perks to lower the weight of objects or increase your carry capacity. Game also gives you an excavator power armor and drinks/food to boost str. Why do you need more?
---
Uh, ESO doesn't have a "huge modding community". It isn't even on the Creation engine like fallout and other elder scrolls games are. It doesn't have a huge modding community, I just checked the nexus and there are only 90 total "mods" for ESO which has been out for years, meanwhile FO76 currently has 200 in less than 6 months of being out.
---
Another thing is bethesda never said in promoting ESO that you could have mods and private servers. They did say that for FO76, on top of that ESO was designed around a monthly subscription, while FO76 is designed around free online play.
---
So comparing ESO with fo76 is like comparing apples and oranges.
---
i just vendored one of these this last weekend. I wish i saw this sooner, i would've just given it to you. 
---
Stash was 10 feet away....
---
I too would also like to know this 
---
When you git gud you'll simply organize 25 pacifists on a server and protect each other. Everything up until then is incentive for you to finally understand the art of the game.
---
I hope you get it soon!
---
*Random* number generator.
---
And not the [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/221/) one either.
---
I'm honestly not sure why they aren't all Legendary anyway. I mean, they are fricking dragons! Everybody knows dragons have treasure, right? 
---
And yes, I know that they are technically giant mutated bats, but for all practical purposes they *are* dragons. 
---
Yeah, they are on the bethesda launcher I snagged fallout 1 and 2 for free from it and I think maybe tactics is also free, not sure haven't looked into it.
---
Good story.  I know the good far outweigh the bad, but I'm glad to hear of a good revenge story as I too have been sniped in this same manner.  Do we keep an asshole list so they can at least be publicly shamed?  
---
30% less damage 30% ap regen at level 3. Not useful if always on a team.
---
That one was a classic before the fix... Good times ;) 
---
Not sure what you mean, but I just wanted to see if there was a way to make weapons respond more to how often you use them.  Like IRL, the more you practice using something the better you are at that particular process.
---
Not trying to turn it into a different game, just introduce that aspect.
---
Yeah, I always carry Excavator armor for carry weight to fast travel after lots of looting, but it helps if I ever get stuck too. 
---
I ran into one of these bases not long ago. I made a B line, my buddy started pulling all the ghouls out the front door, and I just kept slamming the back door in the face of the base owner. He didn't get a single kill; a lvl 23. He was ticked. Started hitting us in passive mode and getting in front of our drops to block us from picking stuff up. We ended up forcing him to auto stem a crap load and he logged. But, yeah. If I ever see someone with a stupid high bounty for trashing someones base like that, I am going to offer to get rid of your bounty and then give you, the caps I got back. 
---
Ok thx
---
Didn't do that quest yet myself... 
---
This is what I had to do after I lost the blade. Worst part was trying to grab the historical sword in Whitesprings as a level 6 against the level 62 charred ghouls.
---
So now you have entered true circular reasoning. If you can get OP to reply to me I will be happy to have a conversation with them. With you. Your just someone over exaggerating for the sake of over exaggerating. 
---
Doc mains rejoice!

Well maybe it’s just me but I raised my luck from 6 to 8 within just a few days I have gotten several legendary weapons including a TSE handmade. I am level 138  and I can tell you increasing my luck has definetly  increased my odds
---
How much you asking?
---
If you hate Idiocracy you must have too large of a vocabulary to say literaLEEEE 100X a day, as well :)
---
You probably just have the mutation where melee attacks cause a retaliation. Remove that and pacifist will work fine. If not please show us the video!
---
Otherwise the stupidly obvious thing to do that any half wit with a few functioning brain cells would do is simply organize a large pacifist clan. Then you all log on the same servers and protect each other.
---
It's not like you want your low effort no skill mouth breathing anti-social game play to be rewarded. You hate Idiocracy - you're l33t!
---
I had a level 15 doing wack-a-mole on me while i was farming in Whitespring. He had a 2 handed melee weapon and i was level 70-ish. Didn't think much of it at first until he started to drop my health to where i had to pop a stimpak. After a few minutes i just logged off so i bounced servers. I think if a player is in passive mode they should take no dmg. If they want to ensure the PVP is not a surprise then before a player becomes active, there should be a 3 sec warning before engaging. That was the first time being grief'd on PC and the second time was a bunch of level 5's but that was slap damage and it wasn't doing hardly any damage on my PA.
---
Nope, you can attack them without repercussion. The one you attack will fight back until it's dead but the others will not.
---
Me too, it's got so much potential to be an amazing game
---
Correct just like legendary effects of armor don't work in PA. I have reduced weapon weight on all 5 pieces and when I get into power armor I'm like 500 pounds overweight 
---
Wow, the only time I've actually been in there I couldn't see a damn thing because of the constant "REEEEEEEEEEE" from the three big bad beasties. That's some sharp eyes on you, Vault Dweller! 
---
Grab a bunch of peeps to clean out the mobs and protect the bots at the end. Most do it solo but even at level 107 i can't seem to solo mobs like i've seen other players do it.
---
I wish you were on PC :( . My wife and I are the same way. Super anti-social but we've enjoyed the few interactions we've had with other players, however minute they were. We've also have never launched a nuke :) Lvl 88 
---
I agree 100%, if you want to be a medic go play battlefield, cod, apex or any other game with the purpose of being a medic engraved in the game
---
Ouch
---
Very true, I think it's 12%?  Thing is that perk works with the plasma flamer, so that 12% is for every plasma flame that hits, after 10 hits you're almost guaranteed a stagger and that gun dishes out ammo at least 2 a second.
---
For those of us trying to play the game without one hitting everything, it makes a big difference.
---
Pass the praise along to u/Sinister_Hands. As I keep telling people, I'm not him. 
---
If you're on PC, hit me up and I can make a full suit of ultracite and/or x-01 for you.
---
Fuel should get the benefit from Ammosmith AND Chemist. Heavy weapons really need some love. 
---
They will nerf bloodied and unyielding before the nerf anti armor 
---
Flatwoods is not nukable.
---
Now that is statistically telling, and this is persisting between sessions?  When you close application and reopen and play it is still doing this to you??
---
&gt;ggest that Northern lookout tower. Perhaps someone had been there recently and loote
---
Hi!
---
Do you still have it? I'm interested. Thanks.
---
I'll poke through the joke and be serious for a second: 
---
I did Silo Alpha solo at level 47. It was incredibly easy, took about 15 minutes, and I dropped a nuke no problems. 
---
Launch codes are online, which makes launching them easier. 
---
Yep this guy is right. I mean we are still launching nukes... we are just waiting for the number of people on the server to go down so we won't get a bunch of people showing up with bolt action rifles and other useless crap while also making her that much harder to kill.
---
hahaha - i went there for a quest line and same but i was alone. Thankful for the 4 high levels in the area that were able to easily wipe them out. Now I try to return the favor when I see low levels in the area.
---
I like farming watoga. The robots there always have alot of lead and steel.
---
It didn't go well, I wasn't prepared and a bunch of assaultrons ran a train on me... 
---
At first it hurt but then the pain slowly faded, five minutes in I couldn't feel a thing, I was being bombarded by lasers...
---
Protections, gutsys, robobrains... They were relentless but I took it like a man and made my way to the control room corridor... And there she was on the right in a room, an assaultron strapped on and ready to beam me up! She failed, I was just to much, by that time I was loose and crazed, in short I didn't care.
---
After a few more tin cans and raking in the xp I pushed on to th reactor... The assaultron, she was waiting with friends... Only this time, she had that blanket from the harry potter films, or some sort of replica,  I couldn't see shit,  I was... Sorry officer I can't gone on...
---
Lawyer: I'd like some time with my client. 
---
Thanks, I did not know that about the plates.  Been awhile since a player melee'd me in my PA.  Usually the griefers in a zone shoot you with a TSE.  I have had the bloodied builds go down too.  The first time was a unarmed character who came up and started punching me.  I just stood there and watched him go south.  I then stimpaked him and walked off, not knowing at the moment I had a bounty.  I was merciful and stupid, he was just ungrateful (revenged him though) He whipped out a TSE and killed me. 
---
The guys in my post caught me in my normal armor which is designed for carry weight, not PVP.  
---
Xbox player here ;-;
---
What happened to you China? You used to be cool.
---
Yes.  That is true.  I meant “normal stuff” as in not having power armor on.  It’s nice to have that +50 when walking around in your regular armor.
---
And many times it’s the best Misc Mod you can get outside specific things when you are needing to fight or with certain builds.  
---
Because I paid full price for this turd and was hoping it would be in a *completed* state by this point and it's not, even 3 1/2 months after release.
---
2k or a nice AA shotty.
---
Toys are great for leads and most of the junks include steel that wont be problem
---
r/unexpectedParksAndRec
---
Is there a site of what fans would like to see in the future of FO games? I mean a winter setting or maybe the ability to get trains to work or what about a BoS game that gives us that perspective. FO4 and FO76 seems to have similarities and would like to think that at some point people would be able to get a mode of transportation up. Thoughts?
---
This right here. I got new plans from workshops and also I was filling up on nuclear material at the same time. 
---
Grafton steel workshop. Has a lead and 2 steel Resource things. And kill all the super mutants and take their guns and scrap em and thats a ton of steel. and there is a bunch of iron ore on the ramp thing
---
r/unexpectedpawnee
---
Are there any higher level players remotely near you? That could cause the enemies to shift in levels
---
Would be useful to know if it's got a cap. I was thinking that it could be useful to know for the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
Batteries Included is usually left off for First Aid.  I usually run gunsmith lvl 5 and first aid lvl 3, and only put on batteries included if I'm overencumbered, same with class freak replacing luck of the draw.
---
That does not change the default weight of plasma cartridges and 2mm em ammo being much heavier than any bullet rounds besides the black powder gun ammo.  It's why I usually keep 1200 plasma cartridges and 400 2mm ammo.  Using my gauss rifle literally makes me lighter with each magazine lol
---
Only started to see this in the last week or so. Supply drops and containers doing the same thing. 
---
The amount of times I try to back out (due to being attacked) only to end up back in the bench menu, is annoying as hell.
---
Flatwood motel and Charlston fire dep for lead. Both have a crap ton of dumbells and weights.
---
Well the way the game is setup, it’s griefing. If there were real consequences that stuck with a player for awhile, then it would be pvp.  In real life, there are deterrents from being a bad person. In this game there is very little, so it’s off balance. I’m all for raiders, but that choice should have consequences over a light pay on the hand. 
---
dang, it just took me about 80, i guess i got lucky!
---
I would love to know as well... I have a furious plasma flamer (base weapon is plasma gun) and it seems to hit like a truck since it's hitting quickly and constantly. But most crap dies too fast to ascertain much.
---
Your 'temporary' suspension must be eating you alive. Lol,  no wait that’s me. ;)
---
Just switch servers.
---
Or take a trick from Black Desert...have a "LootBot" pet that loots corpses for you so you can concentrate on important things, like that Mirelurk Queen that decided to wander over to see what the fuss was with that Vault Dweller and all those Super Mutants...
---
Hey are you still selling serums?
---
There is a mod for that :) PC only though, nexus.
---
Users are somewhat fed up with people constantly posting the same issues, without bothering to do a basic reddit or google search.
---
10 minutes of work on your behalf saves us retyping / copying the same info into 10+ posts a day.
---
A lot of the issues stem from misunderstanding or not wanting to understand how things work, Tradey76 linked a great website that exactly outlays all the changes, Book mark that site and check after each patch update and you will never be out of the loop.
---
Check the patch notes and do experiments yourself, the only thing keeping you from the information you seek, is your intiative.
---
I'm not going to lie - if you have any interest in red dead and like the rockstar games formula and cowboy stuff I would really recommend you get rdr2. If you aren't a big wild west GTA/red dead guy then give 76 a shot. it's just that rdr2 is a very polished and huge experience where so far (and I'm only level 23) 76 is much more fetch quest based. That being said I like 76 a lot more than people say I should and most of on this subject feel that way.
---
At some point you'll learn.
---
 I have a question. I was testing melee weapons on a squad of high level Gulpers outside Watoga. My 200% repaired Blade of Bastet hits about 190 with all the AP possible. It cuts em' down in about 8 hits, that's through their insane regen. My 200% repaired Nocturnal Combat Knife with 40% Speed is a bit quicker, but not much.
---
 Now I did take damage to my X0-1 and often do, especially in groups of high level enemies, but they all die.
---
 How does Bloodied deal with the incoming? I can understand Snipers as they can avoid damage but us frontline troops are right in their faces. ;) 
---
Gee, thanks, Mr. Miyagi.
---
I just [had to](https://imgur.com/a/V3b7VVW) do it. 
---
One of my favourites, so damn weird and in keeping with this world and you can hear the Death Tambos keeping rhythm.
---
Hahaha nice one. 
---
True, but they're such a pain otherwise it's best to server hop out once you've collected your takings.
---
Stop trying to play a Multiplayer PVP game like it’s a single player fallout game lol it’s not, this game is supposed to have pvp 
---
Alright let's try this again.  I agree that private servers would be great,  it might help to save a game in a pretty bad state right now.
---
ESO is elder scrolls with an online skin.  Almost identical in implementation to Fallout 76.  I believe the same people who added the net code to convert elder scrolls to online were used to do the same with Fallout 4.
---
Both Fallout 4 and Elder scrolls have huge modding communities around them, both games have similar net code implementation, both games were used as the base for their online versions.
---
What I am saying is it is highly unlikely that Bethesda will go the route of private servers.  Doing so would significantly decrease sales from the atomic store, something they have shown takes a significant priority (atomic store items get updated and fixed before bugs and exploits.)
---
Sadly, despite their being a significant number of mods already out for FO76 (all of which to my knowledge are just modified FO4 mods), none of those mods are supported or allowed (explicitly) to be used.  They can ban anyone using the mods, and have banned some users already.  If the mod is small and only provides quality of life improvements they will likely ignore their use.  But they still will not allow the game to have private servers just simply based on the premise there is a huge demand.
---
Even if modders are often better at fixing the games issues, Bethesda is not going to release the reins on this game anytime soon, if ever.  The largest reason being that decreased atomic store sells will hurt their bottom line.
---
I HAS been a while. I thought I just got that much tougher, LOL. 
---
Or Separate PVP and PVE and the end of the story.
---
So there aren’t any people to talk to. A lot of the quests are go here, fight these people, get this item, or crafting tutorials. But for me it stays relatively interesting cause each location is full of holotapes and notes. These stories are incredibly well written and compelling. But then again searching ruins for lore has always been my favorite part of fallout games
---
Dude. plans. 
---
Take a workshop, you get plans. defend it, you get plans. 
---
You tend to get a good chunk of stimpaks and purified water in most defend events also. Always useful. 
---
I keep the few things that I think I will need to that my friends would need (if I have space). I also keep any nice low level legendary items to give to new players. I sell the rest for minuscule cap amounts until I can't sell anymore that day. I then drop the rest in a paper bag or put it in a cash register.
---
My suggestion would be to put those caps to work and buy a super nice item or 2. Then you can start selling off crappy legendary items again.
---
Server jumps do solve most things, it's just while I'm in a hot fight and it would be nice if it worked, even a teeny weeny bit would be nice.
---
Get over yourself. 
---
System?
---
I enjoy collecting it and helping other players out. When I come across a level 25 or so player I ask if they have the excavator power armor yet if not I help them get it and give them all the materials needed to build it. Do you need flux?  Do you need bulk gears or springs I have 40-50 each in my stash and you can never have to much black titanium and nuclear material I keep about 250 each of those also in the stash. Because I like helping my fellow vault dwellers that's why I need it.
---
Some folks vendor off all that they can.  Others will leave them in containers for other folks to take. Whitesprings and Watoga Station are common spots. 
---
Others have multiple characters and maybe multiple accounts to hold them. With the reveal of the Purveyor, more folks may be holding onto legendaries in hopes of getting something more useful down the road. 
---
I think it is kind of an anti griefing thing. Would suck if people just sat and tried to kill people in the events
---
If the walls are brick, and they’re using the tall single windows you can just jump right through them
---
I haven't found that to be the case.  I always run Pacifist.  I had a level 70-something player trying his damndest to kill me last night, and I just kept going about my business.
---
The only time I've ever been killed in Pacifist mode was when I had a workshop, which turns Pacifist off.
---
It scares the shit out of me losing legendary goodies... do you have any clue what caused the loss of yours?
---
China still cool! You pay later!
---
No reason to keep legendaries you have no use for. Drop them, gift them, sell them, doesn't matter.
---
Player vending and the legendary vendor are months away. For the former, it will probably work from your stash so you can't stockpile legendaries separately. The latter will likely be 3 for 1: give it 3 items and it will reroll into 1 new legendary. You still won't be able to stockpile to much items till then. I'd keep around 3-4 2\* and 3\* I have no use for but would like to "sacrifice" at this vendor for testing.
---
In the aforementioned games, there's usually an way to play damn near by yourself. In FO76 there aught to be a way to create your own server, whitelist it, or password protect it so as to have only the people you want playing.
---
From my understanding, the FO76 map is huge, and the player limit is only 24 people. I'm surprised you encounter anyone at all.
---
Depends on your level. If you're just getting started there's a gym in the Charleston Fire Department with a ton of free weights you can scrap for lead. A little later one of the skyscraper luxury houses by Garrahan mining has a gym also with a ton of free weights - you can get the key at Garrahan mining, which also has a ton of iron ore you can refine to steel.
---
You also might want to consider setting up CAMP on a lead deposit. There's one north of Huntersville I like. In the meantime be sure to collect the stuff that has lead that you might not be aware of like most toys, paint cans and pencils.
---
100% with you, I played since BETA since day one and still play. Absolutely love this game. I'm like level 160+ and still haven't opened the entire map. Finding outfits, cool stuff, farming legendarily weapons man I love it. Can't wait for the legendary merchant. Honestly no other game (online MMO) could have kept me interested for such a long time and Fallout 76 did the trick, it something more than I expected. 
---
Yeah one of my buddies broke in my house like this the other day lol. Luckily I just got the metal building set. Time to renovate
---
I mean, VATS doesn’t slow time I. ‘76. If someone manages to shoot down a grenade, they earned it...
---
Shoot just putting in overtime switched from shoes to PC nice Gnome need one here lol
---
Yep, last time I shot a legendary lvl 1 beaver. It dropped a legendary bloodied rolling pin (is that how you say it in English ?), how cute.
---
A salt mine would be more realistic, but as far as I know, one doesn't exist, and I don't think they would be adding it to the game just for salt, so an alternative would be the more suitable than a new asset.
---
It's not fresh water.  Toxic water is found at a select number of sources, and it's not just toxic because of radiation.  Just from a trip to Whitespring, you can collect toxic water from the back rooms.  Toxic water seems to be 'toxic' because there are probably other things in it, minerals seem to be potentially included in that set of things on top of being radioactive. The idea would be that distilling that would leave behind whatever minerals might have been in the water.
---
But to address the other thing like pepper, no, it's not going to be exact.  The whole idea is that you're not creating exactly the same thing, but a substitute that functions the same time.  This is a bit similar to how in New Vegas, you could produce home-brewed Nuka Cola and Sunset Sarsaparilla.  But you're not really using any of the actual ingredients used to produce those things, you're just using substitutes that make something similar, but the finished product is treated the same as the 'real' thing.
---
That's why for 'salt', and 'pepper', they'd be things that seem like being reasonable substitutes for the actual things.  Firecracker berries seem like something that has a 'bite' to it simply because of the way the plant quite literally pop and explode, if it's volatile that way, there's a chance it's volatile in other ways.
---
Doesnt that defeat the purpose of being overencumbered
---
I’m level 36 but none of my friends play it so I can play with you and maybe you can help with some missions
---
You can quickly go out to the main menu and then nothing have to worry about it. Just take a little time change the server.
---
Wait till pvp and pve separate.
---
This spot for survival mode tho 😎😎
---
My best guess is because you couldn’t get too workbenches in the workshops because the previous player block them with cement so you could not claim it
---
I've not done exhaustive testing on this, but it is my subjective experience that sustained fire more rapidly damages heavy weapons vs spaced out controlled bursts using the same amount of ammo.  As in if I simply hold down the fire button, it breaks faster with fewer reloads than if I give the weapon time to cool down.
---
 I have less than 40 lbs of non junk stuff in my stash. I have to bulk and sell stuff to make room for ... more junk. Its a vicious circle I'm trapped in. ;)
---
Hence my donut idea or fix that issue with Foundation stacking. 
---
I throw them on my mule character lol.
---
I was killed by slap damage more than once while mass producing boiled water to make teas/healing salves, I'd sit down and start cooking the boiled water up and some jaggof with a very fast hitting melee would just start wailing until my hp was gone, then take all my wood I needed for boiling the water
---
This, defedning from mibs can get a bit annoying but 8t always keeps me stocked up on water and meds. The plans are the icing on the cake!
---
level 17 I was still in the forest...
---
Don't understand whats the rush - the beauty of this game is the exploration, not just the quests.  Level 77 - no nuke yet...
---
After removing and reapplying Adrenal it works fine; I haven’t played close attention but I’ve heard they adjusted the health range&lt;-&gt;damage bonus chart. 
---
It is heavily bugged if you use Strange in Numbers perk though. Out of group, SiN doesn’t do anything, Adrenal works fine. In group, close to a mutated teammate, SiN causes Adrenal to give no bonus damage. In group, far from teammate, SiN causes Adrenal to give *negative* damage. 
---
Aha funny
---
Or like wow that inspecting a corpse shows you the loot from all corpses around you
---
I get server hopping, but I don’t see why anyone should have to hop to avoid something they obviously don’t want to do. Why give us the option to opt out of PVP when we can still die to damage from another player?
---
For all this game's faults, the map is absolutely great, by far my favorite in any Fallout game. I can never go back to 4, that world doesn't even begin to compare.
---
Yep, [I know,](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/avxacs/to_the_low_level_who_owned_gorge_junkyard_i_am/ehjmodo/) that's the only thing workshops are good for. However, there is a finite number of plans you can get from them, and after a little while of playing you'll have most of them.
---
No, anyone (PS4 players, xbox players, etc) can play them. But you have to play them on a PC. Thankfully, they are not graphic heavy games and run fairly well on most computers.
---
Hehe-he, I'm level 166 and I still haven't launched a Nuke too :) Are you on PC? Maybe we launch it together. 
---
Theres some well done quests and the grafton area early on can keep you busy for hours, theres a few areas like that. Just be ready to manage your inventory. My 2 cents is if you can somehow rent the game to try it i could see you really enjoying it, but i think the game is worth 40 dollars i paid 40 back in January and ive gotten well beyond 40 dollars worth. Once they flesh out existing areas and have more raids and end game content like they are planning itll be even more fun, its a unique game nothing like it. 
---
Or you can suffer with these douchebag raiders.
---
Your choice.
---
"I will chop your heads off!"
---
Idk happened to me 2 times aswell. Either she has a shitload of HP or its broken. I placed a post about this weeks ago.  First time she was dead in less than 10 min she even regained HP and the 2 other times she took damage easily  to a certain point and then no damage at all. So i think its broken. 
---
That does show both side of the game, you're a nice guy IRL but 'play the game' and get toxic because you are aiming to get an achievement award. PVP advocates to not go outside their homes, kill kittens and beat up old ladies and children.
---
It's just a game, I've tried hard not to care about dying now in game, rarely have junk worth a damn on me and I just re-spawn and carry on. Not into PVP, way too complicated for an old guy, but if people want to kill me when I'm massaging a workshop, good luck to them.
---
If you read the story it’s pretty clear he did not, or else the bloodied melee guy would’ve just one shotted him.
---
This. My best fight was vs. a 3 man tactical team trying to take munition from me.
---
I never lost any junk, and made more caps than I lost. Just never thought/bothered to make a self promoting post about it.
---
Well, hopefully they’ll separate the two sooner rather than later. 
---
The legendary tag doesn't always mean it is worth keeping. If it has an effect that is useful to you, on a weapon/armour you use then yes it's a keeper if you are going to use it. Otherwise just dispose of as you see fit.
---
I'll sell mine at vendors. I don't care if I only get 12 caps. Caps are caps. If I've reached my daily limit I'll either stash them and sell next day or just drop them. Or donate to a friend who wants it. 
---
A one star troubleshooters meat hook may be useless to me, but it may be another players ideal weapon. If not then it just vanishes into the ether. 
---
But it's sometimes hard. On fallout 4 I have a chestful of legendaries I'll never use. But I'm a hoarder. They just sit in that chest (next to the chest of teddy bears, which is next to the chest of gold watches/lighters/lockets. Etc etc).
---
Ooh, I'm going to have to look into this when I get home from work! 
---
One time and one time only, I went with Unyielding set to get my Luck near 30, and I immediately had five legendary protectrons spawn around Watoga. I mean, I saw five in about two minutes of running and gunning. Hard to saw that's a coincidence, although I can't prove it wasn't. I am Lvl 120ish, and I have never seen that before or since.
---
I'm just waiting for the legendary vendor to be added so we can break the stuff down.
---
We're Talking About Sex, Right?
---
I run a 6 Luck HW user. I also have a ~30 Luck Unyielding/Vats sniper. I haven’t noticed a difference in loot between the two. Just the condition of found weapons.
---
I used to do a shotgun/melee switch class, but tbh shotguns lose a lot of damage over range
---
OK, that makes perfect sense then, stops me thumping dudes in the heat of SBQ battle, but will get nuked myself if the player has a PVP build.
---
From what I’ve heard around the block, it caps at 30%... I’m not sure the gain rate. It’s a hard thing to test. Might need to dig into the ESM files with modding tools and read he script data.
---
Well, can be agree that the opt out of combat is not suitable for the game yet.
---
But still can avoid mu chi regret situation.
---
The question is if it was truly gone
---
Pretty sure they never left. I am seeing a lot less “server not responding” messages and watching P2W services skyrocket, so that’s a good sign
---
Watoga, Flatwoods, fire station in Charleston, Morgantown high, sugar grove, funfair like Tyler fairground...the list goes on.
---
Basically anywhere with robots, gym equipment, toys, office materials (pencils).
---
Its everywhere really.
---
That's my next one, actually (when I get the lines from my friends)!
---
We now have a discord for the community! Advertising this is not allowed on this sub so if you would like to join then PM me for a link. 
---
No, it was just something I created that I felt was missing from the game. A fun audio project!
---
.... sooo.... you activated Pacifist, and then someone walked into your axe and died? Cool story bro, pacifist doesn’t work like that. 
---
I need this too!
---
I agree. I can remember finding an invisible wall in new Vegas. It’s my strongest memory of the game and shattered the feeling of it being a big open world free to explore. It probably lead to a mountaintop with no point. But a Bethesda game lets you scale a steel cliff if you want and get there. And that’s the point 
---
&gt; ESO is elder scrolls with an online skin. Almost identical in implementation to Fallout 76. I believe the same people who added the net code to convert elder scrolls to online were used to do the same with Fallout 4.
---
No, that is completely wrong, ESO is built on an MMO engine that has nothing to do with the creation engine that the fallout and elder scrolls games (aside from ESO) run on. It was called "hero engine" and used in ESO and STWOR: https://elderscrollsonline.info/news/about-game-engine
---
&gt;Both Fallout 4 and Elder scrolls have huge modding communities around them, both games have similar net code implementation, both games were used as the base for their online versions.
---
Once again this is completely incorrect, ESO's engine has NOTHING to do with the creation engine, it is its own completely different thing.
---
&gt;What I am saying is it is highly unlikely that Bethesda will go the route of private servers. Doing so would significantly decrease sales from the atomic store, something they have shown takes a significant priority
---
The modders have already started a while ago reverse engineering the servers to create private servers. This has nothing to do with Bethesda doing it, as they don't release their own mods either, even the ones they sell in the creation club are mods made by modders from the modding community.
---
&gt;Sadly, despite their being a significant number of mods already out for FO76 (all of which to my knowledge are just modified FO4 mods)
---
Most of the most popular mods for FO76 aren't just mods from FO4, such as perk loadout manager, Save my Stuff that stops you from selling favorited gear, etc. 
---
&gt;none of those mods are supported or allowed (explicitly) to be used
---
The FAQ doesn't say you aren't allowed to use them, just that you use them at your own risk of game crashes and glitches. They have also shared screenshots of people using mods in FO76 from the official bethesda twitter account. 
---
&gt; They can ban anyone using the mods, and have banned some users already.
---
They haven't banned anyone for mods only, the only thing close to that is people who were using cheat engine to actually cheat in the game. But that isn't a mod that is a third party program that modifies what your game sends to the server and gets back.
---
&gt;Even if modders are often better at fixing the games issues, Bethesda is not going to release the reins on this game anytime soon, if ever. The largest reason being that decreased atomic store sells will hurt their bottom line.
---
That makes no sense. They allow mods on their games that have the creation club. If they were going to limit things to only effect their bottom line they would disallow mods that aren't from the creation club in their other games. They don't though, likewise they aren't going to stop people from modding this game and playing on private servers. They would be silly to block that, as private servers would probably bring many players back that quit and then those returning players would be more likely to use the atom shop. Remember they can easily have it so you can use the atom shop even if you are playing on a private server. Say you buy this PA skin in the atom shop, it can still work on the private server you play on.
---
So honestly it would be better financially for them for private servers to be a thing. 
---
Grafton steel mill for steel, Lucky Hole Mine for lead ore, Hemlock Holes for acid to smelt the ore. Any of the missile silos with continuously spawn robots which drop lead, steel, and copper pretty consistently. 
---
Executioner's would be better on a deathclaw. Furious would only be better against the queen and only until she falls below 40% health.
---
Since a deathclaw kills mostly anything in &lt;4 hits it will be doing 150% damage before the furious stacks up.
---
Ok but what are you in the game lol
---
I'll take you up on that... I'm level 68 and I've not done it... but never attempted either.
---
Vote slammed! very apt. I upvoted as I really try now to see other players as potential raiders and act accordingly. Even low level players could be experienced PVP gods breaking in a new character or just driving a mule with a whole team of red delights waiting in the wings.
---
It's already being done. How many run alts simply to stash caps and junk items?  
---
Not as easy as a built in feature, but the principle is the same. 
---
Nope. Its bugged right now to break weapons really fast.
---
Energy weapons in general are in a pretty bad place right now. They're pretty rare in the first place, but are also weaker than ballistic weapons for the most part, have severe durability issues, can no longer spawn with explosive and aren't affected by perks like Tank Killer. There's literally no reason for me to use a laser or plasma rifle.  Oh and they're bugged so that if you turn an enemy to a pile of ash or goo at a distance, you can't get loot from them.
---
Really not sure what Bethesda was thinking whem they were balancing weapons... probably weren't thinking much at all.
---
Lucky Hole mine + Excavator arms will get you a ridiculous amount of lead. Other sources are less reliable because someone else often got there first.
---
I usually farm weapons for steel. Anywhere with a lot of supermutants or scorched will do.
---
The rest in the group can also access the terminal... it just shows up on their pip boy.
---
Sell it on Let Go
---
If any of you are on PS4 and have this, I'll buy.
---
Compare what I get with what I got, sell what I can, drop or give away all the rest.  Gonna be able to scrap them soon if Bethesda is to believed
---
The latest release of Perk Loadout manager works fine. Not as well as it used to, hard to adjust on the fly, but workable. Currently doesn’t support automatic recognition of different characters though, like it used to. You can set up different Ini files for different characters but you have to manually swap them out outside of the game. 
---
Ok I’ll take it, my gamer tag is MILKMONST3R626 (don’t judge I made it when I was 8).  I’ll be on later today 
---
To add to this, all the Excavator mods can be found as plans at the vendor in Grafton and Camden Park.  Calibrated shocks, among other things, will need pure flux to craft, so be ready to head into some nuke zones.
---
Unrelated, but Phoenix at the Watoga Shopping plaza has the plans for the T-series armor mods.
---
I just got one of these yesterday. Haven't had a chance to test it out yet.
---
I took it to Whitesprings and melted some ghouls but realized that I likely wasn't gaining from the furious modifier because I was spraying the whole mob.
---
But what about the Teddy Bears, I can't just leave them to the ghouls and monsters :(
---
Well, roughly a month away...
---
Caps are physical. Money is a social construct. 
---
Still would be nice.
---
Share the Tenderizer perk, use bloody mess, and tank killer and she'll take more damage.
---
Igt Robrx2 ... will not be on until 9/10pm est tonight but add me and you can join us. For a first time you probably want to do the queen. Also dm me ... we mostly use discord as opposed to ingame coms if you have access to it
---
Damn.
---
Seriously? That's pretty awesome!
---
Here is our discord link!
---
https://discord.gg/SEhqA8B
---
Sure? If you’re min-maxing a full set of specific gear with specific mods (deep pocketed to be able to surpass Excavator), what’s wrong with that? You still aren’t surpassing modded excavator’s 200lb bonus.  
---
Remove all weapons and armor, only unarmed fists allowed, then only the ability to use your perk build wisely will make a difference, Oh and remove all creatures too. Simples.
---
Same. It does melt protectrons in Watoga nice and quickly though.
---
Gain rate is roughly 5% per hit, but it's difficult to be precise. Could do with a mod that shows enemy HP numerically.
---
No, I'm not. I just don't see why I need to give you my medical history before you will take what I am saying seriously. It sounds more like you are just looking for any excuse you can to ignore the fact that bethesda literally has NO options at all for people who are disabled to help them in the game. 
---
I don't know why you feel the need to just tell disabled people, "oh it is on you to deal with their lack of options for those of you who are disabled."  I mean you seriously tried to make the excuse, "oh so what if they don't offer options for your disability, just go find someone else to play the game for you". 
---
What you fail to realize is, it isn't our fault that bethesda has chose not to include very simple options EVERY OTHER GAME has, instead you defend the multi million dollar corporation from those pesky disabled people! How dare they want the ability to remap mouse controls to keyboard, or have text chat because of hearing problems, or options to change the colors the pip boy, map, and HUD display for those with color blindness.
---
I will say TSE is wack for PvP. I redownloaded the game last night out of boredom, went to the ammo factory for some 5.56 and got dumpstered by some level 48 while I’m a 64 in power armor. 
---
Grafton Steel Mill for Steel, but aside from extracting it,probably a lot easier to kill the Super Mutants there and just scrap any weapons you find.
---
If you're up to this task, here's another method I started doing cause I up end up needing ammo most of the time lol. Note: You'll need a lot of acid for this and the perk Super Duper
---
Steel/Lead: Head down to Hornwright Testing Site 03 by Vault 63 in the Ash Heap. When you spawn there, there should be a cliff to your left and you'll see iron ore veins all over it, along with some lead ore veins as well. Use your excavator power armor to do this to maximize this (let's you get more ore) and be thorough all over that Cliff. Once you're done there, head back to where you spawned and what you're gonna want to do is move straight forward past the chain link fence door entrance then immediately turn left and go up the hills. As you walk towards that direction, you'll see a stump with some blight/orange fungus on it (can't miss it). If you see it, you're heading in the right direction, but go beyond it further up the hill and you should see a mini cliff face sticking out with more iron one veins (6 or 7 if I recall).
---
You should have close to 100+ iron and lead ore in your inventory. Head back to a chem station, equip Super Duper and you'll easily get more than 300 scrap of both no problem.
---
Lead: You'll need your excavator power armor for this one as well. But you'll be heading to Lucky Hole Mine near Fort Defiance in the Bog area. The only thing I can say is be thorough when you're in the mine, cause with the excavator power armor, you can easily get over 400 lead ore there (1000+ lead scrap), but you'll need so much acid to smelt it down lol (remember to have super duper when you do this to maximize your production output) But capturing Hemlock Holes Maintenance for a few hours should do the trick.
---
Best of luck!

Raider tip: I VATS your mines before claiming. It's still a solid suggestion though and mines occasionally work against stealth boy spammers in PVP.
---
It's never fun when it's planned. Just let it happen organically.
---
Blackwater Mine is good for steel. Kill all the mole miners and scrap all the junk. If Uranium fever is up you can easily net 500+ steel.
---
I'm looking at pimping my t-51b with some mods haven't decided what to go for yet :)
---
I hear ya!
---
I had the same thing happen to me. I was lvl 60, had just logged into the server, solo, no workshops, nothing that would initiate PvP. 
---
A lvl 161 jerk with a bladed powerfist came up on me in the woods and started hitting me for well over the 5hp bullshit everyone takes as gospel. I was checking  my hp in the midst of using stim packs and spamming thumbs down, and they were doing 10-15 dmg every hit, **not** 5.
---
Maybe you just discovered something about Vault 94, hmmmmm?
---
I almost did actually. 
---
Bought the game for £15...have 48hrs to return it and swap it for another.
---
So ended up the best of both worlds.
---
Can't wait to get out in the wasteland and will be checking out grafton, cheers. 
---
You can't start a new character if you are banned.  You have to buy the game again to start a new account.  Xbox Is the only console that can do family share and make another account 
---
He had no bounty on him. 
---
If you enjoyed FO3 i'd say pick it up especially for that price and the fact you already put some time on RDR2. Ignore the online comments as no one is ever happy with anything now a days.
---
You'd think that as fast as it goes through 300 rounds it probably doesn't take long to reach the max damage modifier. Unless of course it is bugged.
---
As a rifle build I'm hoping it will be my heavy hitter for the SBQ.
---
And acid.
---
I dig the world in 76, I  really do. It's huge, and varied, with each zone definitely distinct but none of it seems too alien or disconnected from the rest of the map. Ultimately though I'd have rather waited 10 years for them to make a more traditional Fallout game in this world, so I could interact with the inhabitants of Appalachia instead of sifting through their corpses
---
Still wish they could introduce a persistent stash box say at Vault 76, so we can just dump unwanted stuff for new players or anyone who wants it. I'd do it all the time.
---
Get her in some excavator PA and drag her around whitesprings for awhile, even while not nuked it can provide some fast exp gains with the bloated ones.
---
That's it, thanks!
---
So many games do this properly, while i don't play too many Online multiplayer games there are others that simply do these things better. 
---
Games like Destiny come to mind, where you have an large public area but breaks off into private sessions when required. PvP is restricted to specific events only. Once you have open PvP all it takes is a few people to make a server toxic. Take for example GTA:O a few bad people on a server will screw it up for everyone. 
---
My bigger concern with PvP and these games as a whole, is for your average player someone who can put in a few hours here and there simply cannot compete with people who eat sleep and breath the game. Then of course with these games you can never experience the full thing because it becomes a 2nd job to earn the stuff so you can progress or experience it in full.  Again GTA became this where you grind for days just to buy a new car you want to have fun with. Want a new subset of missions that are fun, challenging and interesting well grind out other missions hours on end to earn enough money to buy into said missions, but then all it takes is a few toxic players to screw it all up and turn a night of work into a pain. 
---
In Fo76 there are a ton of build options to survive the endgame so it really distracts and takes away from the whole game for someone to experience. As with many other "RPG" games the endgame only works on very specific builds or tons of tricks that is defeats the purpose of an RPG. Think Borderlands, one of my all time favorite games, i cannot enjoy 100% because they decided to add cheap as fuck raid bosses that require specific builds, characters, guns, exploits and glitches to beat. 
---
Yeah, in my opinion Furious is pretty bad. It takes 6 hits to reach a 30% bonus. There’s not many enemies I take 6 hits to kill; and a straight 30%vs Type bonus is going to be as good on the first shot. Anti armor has a lower cap but works immediately, so effectively will do more total damage until you’ve sent like 9-10 shots down the line. Bloodied will always vastly outperform if you run a low health build. Instigating will double your first shot, which with the way DR works, results in more than 100% effective bonus damage, which means again Furious will take like 8-9 hits to “catch up”. 
---
If you regularly dump half a mag to kill a single enemy, maybe furious will make sense for you. But I’d say you’re better off rethinking your build to be more damage efficient in other ways. 
---
I used to have 4 accounts in Eve Online in a corporation and shared stuff that way. I just can't be bothered to manage more than one character in FO76, my loss I guess.
---
In those cases wouldn't you get the 'pacifist mode enabled - you cannot damage other players' message?
---
Cheers for the help everyone.
---
Had to give 76 a bash in the end..see you in the wasteland
---
No change since the patch. If you remove and re-add it it works fine if you don’t use Strange in Numbers perk. It bugs to fuck with SiN
---
Now THAT sucks. 
---
Truth.
---
I use the Overseer’s Camp. Some folks wait outside Vault76 if they see a new guy on the map. 
---
Okay cool thank you 
---
I like the way you think, I'd like to have multiple stash boxes for unique and different items just because.
---
that is grahm the traveling supermutant merchant. he is not new, and he traveling along the roads between workshops all over the map.
---
You misunderstand the definition of pacifist. 
---
of course. but the gamma gun is actually the answer to bloodied builds.
---
Haha, imagined me getting banned after descovering  it 
---
New players may have better luck getting the mod items for the Calibrated Shocks.  They can be found at Harpers Ferry vendor.  (Among others). 
---
my first time seeing him, i had to double take, that said i bought some ammo
---
The wall isn't invisible, there is just a blatant message on your screen that says "you can't go that way". If you want to see it, try crossing the river on the east edge of the map. I wanted to see where the playable part of the map ened one day. 
---
It really is one of the best worlds that Bethesda has built.  The previous Fallouts were pretty flat. 76 brings a lot of Skyrim's dramatic elevation into the world and adds the distinct biomes.  The way the storytelling is intricately tied to the environment makes it feel cohesive.
---
Haha, imagined me getting banned after descovering it!
---
I don't agree with this advice. For the first time do it with the largest group possible and be sure there is a good amount of diversity. Specific skills can make the whole things go much more smoothly.
---
I dump all my stuff in the container right next to the whitesprings vendors door. Other people seem to do the same.
---
Sure, maybe. But you can’t get 3k 5.56 everyday by watching Netflix shows, now can you? Afk’ing the ammo factory can. And if someone attacks, wonderful, I’m built for PvP and I love caps.
---
What's your build?
---
They always run away from me even nude, I can't actually but imagine their deranged screaming as they run to the hills.
---
yep - same on PC
---
In most places nuke education begins in elementary school. Though I agree he shouldn't launch one until he's at least level 18.
---
I've axed 100s of charred bloated and glowing ghouls where they go to party with golf buddies on the links but all they say is "grahhh" and "wahhh"  ... 4/10 I despise WS as much as the dummies that build there and that impossible circle stuck on my map, I have never seen it as the mythical low level fairy tale zone people describe it as. 
---
Whitespring. 
---
Ok you sound informed I’m going for it. 
---
Not everybody builds on water. 
---
Point is, claiming a workshop is about zero effort. cost you 25 caps, and you get a random plan and sometimes some other goodies. Most of the time, defend events are generally a mild inconvenience. 
---
Besides, I have never found a faster/easier way to get acid than just sitting on Hemlock for a bit. And since I am all about air site #3 with excavator armor, I like gettin 100 acid/hour while I am off doing other things. 
---
And that there is the point. passively acquire something while you are off doing something else. 
---
White Springs. Forget the SB Queen, it's too much of an investment with little gain.

I need to stock up on ammo lol I have a bloodied limb dmg  one rn stocking up on anti bloodied measures

Alright thanks ! :)
---
Thank you 
---
Non power armor builds are totally viable. There’s a lot of defensive perks that only buff defense outside of power armor. 
---
Good place too, I totally forgot about it, plus spawn rate of legendary enemies there is good too. 
---
It's all about your build and armor. I'm doing a sneak/partial unyielding build and I'm loving it! Gotta pair it with the right weapons though. If doing unyielding best bet it's probably bloody weapons.
---
Cause if they didn't come out of your pocket how many players would just run around racking up a bounty for their friends just to claim and split 2500 caps.
---
The other dude is horrible at explaining. What he’s saying is currently the mod is bugged and doesn’t actually do what it says it will do, because it’s expecting an impossible condition before it runs it’s script. You can apply it but it has zero effect. 
---
No, I'm fairly sure it will be tied to your Stash.  I'm just not sure what difference that would make with respect to your suggestion. 
---
Nothing from Bethesda? Sure you want to stick to that story when it's soooooooooooo hard to look for the "Bethesda replied" tag? 
---
&gt;There are three issues currently affecting Adrenal Reaction that we're looking to address:
---
* Adrenal Reaction's positive effects are not applied to the player if they had the mutation prior to Patch 6 release.
---
* Adrenal Reaction's damage bonus is dealing less damage than intended following Patch 6 release.
---
* Reapplying Adrenal Reaction after Patch 6 release can cause some of its effects to fail to display in the Pip-Boy if the player logs out/back in.
---
We're currently working toward fixes for the first two and hope to have them addressed with Patch 7. The third requires some additional investigation, but we're looking into that as well.
---
To answer your question OP, reapplying Adrenal Reaction should work you just may not see all of its effects in the Pip-Boy right now after changing servers/relogging.
---
There’s other spots that I’m sure are good too but it’s hard to beat the golf club for xp. 
---
I want to know if the prop placement for gnomes and teddy bears are the same person.  If not, are they friends, rivals? They seem to vying for the most well-hidden little scenes in the last few games.
---
Builds.  That all gives me a headache.  I don't want to fuss around with constantly monitoring my health so it's always 20% or other tedious micromanagement crap like that.  I guess I'm just melee.  That's it.  I have a lever action rifle for the few times I need it.
---
Hey, no offense, but you aren’t explaining this well. Here’s a way that’s easy to understand: “currently the mod’s effect doesn’t work because the script is looking for an impossible situation. So, it’s bugged. Don’t bother applying the mod.”
---
.... what? It damn well shouldn’t. 
---
No its not new, he is a travelling merchant and funny too. :) I saw him at Flatwoods once. 
---
I'm a casual player who just wants to enjoy himself and not slog every where in power armor.  I don't know how to make that work, what perks I should pick up, I quite like the perks I have.

---
I’d run away if a nude guy was coming at me in a brand new game. 
---
I don't have one because that all confuses me and gives me a headache.  I don't want more tedious micromanagement, I just want to play the game without having to stomp slowly everywhere in loud clunky armor.
---
RDR2 has a fantastic single player campaign, Fo76 is better with friends.   I'd let that be my guide on purchasing it.
---
True but that's more a matter of getting lucky with server hops.  It took me several days of hopping to find my second calibrated shocks for my X-01 set and I was particularly happy that I could just craft them for the other armor types now.  Ironically right after I crafted the ones for my Excavator set I found two more in vendors on the same server.  Learning to farm nuked flora was really useful tho.
---
I’d be more concerned with containing those floppy granny boobs... ;) I hear ya, though. It sucks.

---
hmmm. ive only seen that once per new character ive made, and ive made all 5 we can make
---
it must be a bug if you have ever gotten it twice on once character
---
besides, its hardly anything to get to upset over, all you have to do is click out of it yeesh
---
Eh, you don't have to go melee. I run shotguns, but I do run x01 PA also, but you don't have to go just melee PA build. 
---
Yes psn ? 
---
This is a survival game. You have to eat and drink to survive. Inventory management and preparedness are a part of the experience. 
---
This is not the Sims and you shouldn’t go afk in your base for hours, that’s just crazy. You get no benefit from being logged in unless you have a workshop. If you have a workshop, the food and drink are the cost of staying alive.
---
So do it? I have mostly leather armor, and the only defensive perk is Fireproof (I do swap in Blocker for PvP). I run as a stealth vats sniper, or a farming non-vats rifleman, PA is strictly for nuke sites.
---
No sorry 
---
yep keep it in your stash :)

Downloaded the launcher, and downloaded the games! Thanks. 
---
You say that having a character build gives you a headache, but that is What role playing games are, man.
---
I only use Power Armor in Nuke Zones and Silos.
---
It really depends on your build.  I'm melee and most things will die in 1-3 stabs.  My main weapon is a 3* Instigating Combat Knife, but I have a 2* Vampire's Combat Knife to keep my health up.  I mainly wear Vanguard armor.
---
For anything that doesn't die quickly, I have the Enforcer perk and a Quad Hardened Combat Shotgun to cripple them.
---
I like melee because it actually works, though.  All non legendary guns seem nerfed as fuck unless I want to use almost all my perk cards for them and have no quality of life perks at all.
---
&gt;The game scales enemies’ levels based on the highest level player in the location/area.
---
That's true to a point, but some areas (mainly the forest and Charleston) are leveled locked regardless of who wanders through. 
---
I felt the same way about it until I tried it for awhile. Once you're out of power armor it's super easy to lower your health without trying hard. There are melee builds too, let me find some stuff for you.
---
With Vault Raids around the corner, I was wondering how healing was going to work and I think this is an amazing idea.
---
The chainsaw modded can actually melt like butter through ghouls and molemines. Plus it can kill someone in X01 armor in about 4 sec. all you have to do is repair it 200% and it brings the damage from 4 to 40. Don’t get me started on the anti armor 40% faster swing rippers. Mine does 50 damage at v- fast swing and has a 40% fast swing for the chin hitting. I just stand in doorways holding down the trigger and ghouls and glowing ones at Whitesprings die as soon as they decide to hit you and you shred there limbs. Pretty op as fuck if you have the right perks, mutations and 200% repair. One of the best melees you can get as far as a just stand and hit weapon
---
don't buy ammo its was of caps. I believe you are low level. I recommend on low level to use what ever you can until you reach level 52. When you get 34-35 Get Ammo smith in Agility it will increase your ammo craft by 80% and on level 50-52 in Luck special get Super Duper. This combination will give you a lot of ammo. Ever since I past level 52 I never had ammo issues. :) And I use auto rifles ammo just flies out of my pockets and comes back :D  
---
Thanks, sounds like I have more mods to learn.
---
For starters ironclad is a must for non PA builds. Solar Shield, Life Giver, Dodgy, there all great too. 
---
For them to return that would assume they ever left. They didn't. Ebay has been flooded with items since BETA, nothing has really changed, except the duped guns aren't TSE anymore.
---
There is a good list of all the outfits [here](https://fo76.mmo-fashion.com/category/database/appearance/outfit/) . The same site also has pages for the underarmor, armor, headgear, and accessories as well! 
---
Says the guy dispensing "wisdom" online.
---
I'm on PC and didn't face such issues. 
---
This is not a survival game as has been said many, many times. This has some elements of a survival game, but it is not a survival game. What exactly is the benefit to players of draining their food and water while they build or while they are idling in their camp? Please explain to me. Do you get overjoyed when you come back and see your character is half dead and all the food is spoiled in your inventory? just from a utility standpoint, it serves no purpose to anyone either, developer or player, to consume food and water when idling / building. It just creates a hassle and makes everyone involved annoyed. 
---
I don't really like the idea of running around with almost no health when I take so much damage from everything already.
---
Yes, because that's what I'm saying. 
---
Happy Camper is a Charisma perk that essentially does this.  Homebody, in Endurance, also gives you slight health regeneration.
---
Sentinel requires you to stand completely still for it to work. It's not the ultimate gear people believe it is.
---
OT: I do hope they force us to create new characters for the survival mode. It would feel much less survival-like if we walk into this new world with lvl 100+ characters.
---
My suggestion was for storage in excess of the protected 800lbs in your stash. So you can keep 800lbs of items that are risk free and then an additional storage value in unsecured containers. It's essentially in parallel to the stash system. 
---
Google melee builds and just get the perks they have. You’ll have a viable build and don’t have to worry about it anymore. 
---
I found shotguns to not be terrible, combat shotgun+ VATS headshot crits seems to be really quite strong. I could 1 shot the ghouls at white spring at level 35 with headshots. So I'm not sure, the only issue I have with shotgun VATS builds is working in a group, end up locking onto other players instead of the ghouls.
---
Just make sure to nuke the entire resort. Sometimes they only nuke the bottom half and the ghouls above the resort don't get irradiated.
---
I have all of the perks except for Empathetic and Herd Mentality. You can cut out the melee perks if you're strictly ranged and Electrically Charged/Plague Walker make no noticeable differences at higher levels in my opinion. The rest of them feel absolutely worth it with Class Freak. My personal favorites are Marsupial, Speed Demon and Healing Factor. 
---
Seen 4 to around 13 or so there at a time. Can't even damage them as far as I can tell, just where their poor mechanical souls go after relieved of duty I guess.
---
That's what I meant. Sorry I wasn't a bit more clear.
---
It reduces it by 80%, but it should reduce it by 100% given the fact that it requires three points into it, and "80%" isn't as significant as it seems to suggest. I have that perk card on with 13 charisma points and lost all my water in just 15 mins from full thirst bar while I was building. 
---
Workshops show the owner name but don't show their owner's level. It makes it a case of having to check and see if the owner is a high level or some low level guy before you claim them, which is pretty much impossible to do if you're wanted.
---
Shotguns being viable would be really nice because the runs I do, I have shotgun shells falling out of my asshole.  I'd have no problem with ammo.
---
Either patch 5 or 6 seems to have made it funky. Prior, you could hold down autofire and hold down space bar (fire critical on PC) and it would build and fire critical as fast as possible. 
---
If you're wanted and have less caps than your bounty you get a bankruptcy debuff.  Reduces damage to players by 50% for 4 hours. 
---
That is in the edge of the map. I accept that they need to cut it off at some point somehow. But in new Vegas this was a mountain in the middle of the map.
---
Oh sweet, thank you.
---
What jack just said, cause that's exactly what I did.
---
Thank you, I saw that site. I believe they are also finding outfits and only then uploading it. Also showing locations, but I pref to find on my own, plus not all of spawn locations are legit. 
---
I wanted to find red bandana few weeks back used this site, and they shown a randomize location :D But I found where it spawn 100% at Wendigo Cave :)
---
What if you're going for the various fluxes?
---
If you’ve got speed demon, it does nothing. It is also irrelevant whether it’s additive because increasing spring speed is capped at 20%.
---
This is a game built with two endgame paths designed - all the power armor all the time, or carefully tweaking perks to your advantage so you can get by without. You're refusing to do either. Maybe find another game, or just play [Fallout 4 in God Mode](https://www.ign.com/wikis/fallout-4/Console_Command_Cheats_Codes).
---
That would be a really neat twist.
---
Thank you, I'll look at that.  Right now I can level up as I am and move some points around.  I just want to not be stuck in power armor everywhere.  
---
&gt; Someone post a thread the other day debunking the myth of being killed via slap damage.
---
Its not a myth. There were issues before that allowed some to bypass slap damage that have since been patched. The guy you're talking about was testing whether or not things were working correctly as of now, and they seemingly are. Its still possible to be killed by slap damage. Its just more difficult as it was intended to be. Have to remember there is a reason murder/wanted is a thing.
---
This's happend to me a couple of times too. Fleshy flying floating corpses.
---
I paid 1500 caps for a legendary heavy BoS leg last night, fair price, the are no easy to find, this was on PC :)
---
 Well this is useless as you do not want to sweat details but my BoS Heavy Combat Armor with Dense on the chest has, with a few perks, about 315b 325e 3r. Its also immune to explosions.
---
 Good stuff, and I only use the X0-1 in my pocket fore specific situations.
---
On Xbox looking for group seems like suspect posts are down 90% or more.  On one of the marketplaces that is duper friendly I don't seem to seeing much of the same items anymore.  Multiple people where posted about all the Furious Explosive handmades on the market now (in  Xbox markeplace) as a sign of duping but I only saw 2 when I searched.  
---
I'm frustrated. Being snide and condescending doesn't help me, but if it makes you feel better, by all means.
---
Oh man I wish you could remember, but ty for replying it’s good to know it’s out there
---
I suspect that was a glitch. Yes, the Ash Heap is technically a higher level area than the forest, but I've claimed the junkyard dozens of times as a level 100+ character and I don't recall ever having to defend against anything stronger than level 20 something super mutants of scorched.
---
I suppose there's a chance that a lower level player was in the area once or twice, but to have that be the case every single time seems incredibly unlikely.
---
Poor guy just trying to buy some mods for his power armour.
---
You're wrong on quite a few points there. I've played hundreds of pvp fights, both solo and with groups vs groups. Explosive shotguns or even TSE's are very powerfull, but not a single time have they ruined a fight for me and my team mates. The game has too many variables for just one weapon to win every fight. Many different tactics can negate the TSE's power.
---
And that literally no one ever wanted pvp in fallout is not based on any fact. Fallout has a very diverse fanbase. It's hardcore (survival) element logically appeals to many pvp'rs.
---
It is a survival game, you are incorrect. They said it wouldn’t be a hardcore survival game like Rust and Ark where you drop all items upon death. Todd Howard himself said this was a “Survival-lite” game. They wanted to make a survival game that wasn’t as punishing to die in.
---
I log when I get up. My character never starves from me being afk. The fun isn’t finding spoiled meat in your inventory, it’s knowing that you are surviving without dying when the odds are against you. 
---
It is not supposed to be a benefit, it’s supposed to be challenge for you and make you get creative surviving in the Wasteland.
---
For some of us it adds immersion to the game because if you sit in your house IRL and you don’t eat or drink anything, you will starve.
---
Fun fact: Grahm's route takes him through the Big Bend Tunnel. I was on a Responders quest and was so dumbfounded to see him ahead of me that I stopped to take some pictures. While I was fiddling with the controls, he trudged on ahead and killed all the scorched ahead of me because they kept attacking him.
---
That's actually helpful.  I've been trying to get a good set of weightless together so i can use my chameleon mutation, but my luck with farming for actually good pieces of it is kind of shit tier lmao.
---
First time will be special but it'll be over very quick.
---
I'd be for that.  Plastic, while not a rare commodity, can't be collected as simply as other resources and is frequently consumed by ammo production.  Having it be the lone resource for bulking, as opposed to the somewhat useless Cloth, definitely eats into the already dubious value of bulking.
---
They come from the plants located inside nuke zones. Different plants have different Flux types. 
---
Interesting...I’ll craft a hatchet and see if I have the same problem.  Thx 4 the info
---
Naw, we are doing great without you.   (Not really, I guess we do miss you after all).  Like Yo said, I'd wait for the expansion.  Things have been a bit better lately and I think they are trying, but it ain't all unicorns and rainbows yet.
---
Scarcity of resources is one of the major foundations of this game, including survival mechanics.  Balancing water/food consumption at all times is part of that.  It would ruin a good part of the game for many people, myself included, if many of these types of requests were implemented (i.e. reduced food/drink requirements, massive increases to stash storage, increased weapon drop rates, etC).
---
And vice versa? Or it doesn't get better than just getting (#caps=#lvl) ?
---
well with the camp decorating update i think we will be able to do just that

---
This is what I use currently -- it is more of a critical shot build.  I use a really good gauss rifle and run with mutations bird bones, adrenal reaction, marsupial, etc.  If you really want to use power armor you can probably move things around from luck into intelligence for the power armor benefits.
---
Pretty sure I saw this reported as a bug where you don’t get the message and since you end up doing damage, it counts. I think it was Reactive Plates that was specifically called out.
---
Are you running that?
---
np! good luck with your search! 
---
"Have you tried turning it off and on again?"
---
It's not snide or condescending. It's a genuine suggestion. You don't want to play the game that is, find a game that meets your desires. If you want to play fallout without power armor or carefully managing your perks, you want to play fallout 4 in god mode. That's a much better fit for what you claim to want.
---
Well honestly my horizons haven't been expanded much past combat arms and metal legs. And metal chest... I got like 2 ballistic mats... So it's a slow Going process 
---
&gt;I have windows on all my walls, so anyone curious can walk around and see the inside
---
It's worth noting that if you have any workbenches or furniture within range of a window people can look through, click on the bench, and glitch through the wall without picking your lock. 
---
Dupers are like the McRib. They may seem like they're gone for a while, but eventually they'll be BACK! lol
---
I’m gnot a gnoblin.
---
Ment to post this here but vice versa or it doesn't get better than #lvls=#caps earned? 
---
Yes, it's much easier to do alone, once you know the procedure, and what to expect, but it's a much more challenging and fruitful adventure with a couple of game friends.
---
The night I launched my first Nuke, I started at level 62 with 2 friends, we teamed up, went to Alpha and someone launched on WS, before that Blast zone had ended, we had scrapped, sold, &amp; stashed, and were headed to Bravo.
---
Bravo was someone else's turn, and each of us had decided to keep our target a secret till we launched, this time it was Prime, and with the help of several other players, we made quick work of the Queen.
---
After a little repair &amp; refit work, we headed for Charlie, it was my turn now, I was both excited, and apprehensive at the same time, the last two Silo battles were intense, with one of the guys being a Bloodied Build and getting killed several times, and I was still undecided where I wanted to hit.
---
When the time finally came for me to launch, I thought of all the places I had seen nuked in the past, then selected a location where I had never seen a blast zone, Wavy Willard's &amp; Hemlock Holes was the Target, and although there weren't near as many legendary Enemies as found in other locations, it was a great cap to the evenings activities with everyone loading up on Flux, and having a wonderful time helping each other.
---
I have launched many other nukes since that first one, some solo, some helping someone else launch their first, and a few others teamed with 2-3 other players, but none has had the same excitement a the first.
---
You missed the best game they ever made. It's archaic now, but at the time, nothing like it.
---
I totally get that. In fallout 4 I never used power armor for a lot of the same reasons you don’t. Another big thing to look for is legendary perks on armor. Vanguard gives up to +35 defense for just having full health. Bolstering is the opposite, +35 for low health.  There’s a bunch of perks that can drop on armor pieces that will help tremendously not to mention mutations. Mutations will make a huge difference too. 
---
You know being wanted means everyone does full damage to you, can kill you without consequence, take your dropped junk, and receive your bounty+level in caps right? Those are literally real consequences. And they don't go away, ever, until someone kills you.
---
was that your last piece you needed?
---
TSE Handmade
---
Arnt you picking up legendary armour to wear?
---
I did not know that, and all my workbenches are against the windowed walls. Good to know!
---
Tin cans, trust me. anywhere you can find em'
---
You said it! I hate these, “Derp, let’s make X easier or eliminate it altogether!” Posts. The game isn’t supposed to be a walk in the park, it’s supposed to be survival in the wastes.
---
In fact, not even the Sims does that, since you have to manage food/drink, bathroom usage, fatigue, etc.
---
This one?

Just restart it and itll to back to normal 
---
Whatever you do, don’t do what I did.  I was so excited I forgot to make sure my otter had a good time too. I found the codes as fast as I could and just launched.  The girl who was doing it with me just stared at me blankly and said, “are you seriously done all ready?”  
---
Just to add a bit to the list of where are they non-scrap mod plans: Deathclaw extra talon, bladed commie whacker...I’ve got the bug now will be checking the non-scrap mod list to see what else there is.
---
Just pay what you think is a fair and reasonable price. That’s what I’ve been going by.
---
Remember kids, the cheaper the game gets the dumber its player base will become.
---
She's beautiful.
---
i love me some mcribs. othing thing i find edible besides nuggets. must be the mystery meat.
---
I concur
---
"Gnome-body knows the trouble I've seen"
---
This is a melee build. I personally wouldn't put that many points in charisma, I'd use the points in luck for class freak if you're running mutations. 
---
https://youtu.be/I8X-e0cKfek
---
I've got a few 2* pieces I'd sell for a reasonable price. I can check what I have after work.
---
You cant be in compat at all. If you're hidden when crouched it activates.
---
Red Bandana can be easily found at the Wendigo Cave. On a Skeleton or on a Teddy Bear who is holding a bone :D HEhe and they are 100% there, found them multiple times. Just YouTube it:) 
---
Blue Bandana can be found not far from Vault 76. Besically look at Vault 76 on the map on the left you will see Road 81, where you see Road 81 icon/sign go there, and you will see 1 ship, blue bandana is right on that ship! Also 100% found it multiple times. 
---
Skull Bandana and Surgical Mask can be bought at the Sutton Station from a vendor, 
---
I am still looking for the other masks/bandanas though, I think camo bandana is sold by Watoga Station Station Vendor found it only once so not sure if vendor is selling it or some player sold it to vendor and this is why I saw it. 
---
I wanna be a Fashion Master too :) 
---
I can’t wait until I can play without assholes running up to me and trying to hack me in the face. 
---
This weekend I discovered a new area (R&amp;G or something station) and as I was looking around some guy started shooting me and blowing up the buses around me. Then I noticed a friend of his hiding in the bushes. I guess they were waiting on me to fight back. 
---
Plus if you ignore them it just eggs them on to keep bothering you. 
---
I play with Passive on, and I shouldn’t have to log out and server hop just to play the game each time people want to be dbags. 
---
Watch someone record a holo and put it inside a bathroom where you have those skeletons on the toilet. “To whoever finds this... I shidded myself. Feels pretty spicy, not sure if I’ll make it.”
---
There are perks to make food/water/chems/ammo/junk weigh less. If you're on PC the [Better Inventory](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/32) mod is excellent for figuring out what weighs so damned much. At one point I found out I was carrying 33 lbs of gunpowder and had just as much in my stash. Now I only make it as needed (plus what I scavenge from supermutants) because that stuff is ridonkulously heavy.
---
You could ask over at Filthy Casuals 😁
---
 Yeah I had em' follow me in once. I guess that's how they get in, but that's a long way from the door.
---
yep or even if you had it away from the wall there is a slight chance it moved.
---
Super duper, Ammosmith, Weapon Artisan.
---
If you can find a Quad gamma gun, put it to automatic, it’s super effective. They will either have to heal, ruining their build. Or die. Hopefully the second one 
---
Thank you :) 
---
Forgive the ignorance but does that just mean armor with a skill? Or stuff dropped by legendaries... Cause that would be a much better option. I got a leg and an arm... need to log in and see which is which but I'm just lost storyline wise and not really sure where to go. (obviously overseer quests and others in the main catagory..) but as far as just exploring for gears and exp
---
If you see that you are not doing any damage just bail on the event. Some think its scaling bug but we will never know. We do know that she is easier to kill with less people. I do wish bethesda would comment on queens scaling, becuase clearly there is a bug sometimes she is actually invincible. 
---
I totally get what you’re saying. And I also get what everyone else is saying. I usually go to my camp to log off. Sometimes I log off and whitesprings and login to a nuke zone, die automatically. But then what happens if one server I’m at whitesprings, no nuke zone, game crashes, I reload into a new server, and I’m in a nuke zone... that’s the real question... 
---
Not from my experience...
---
What went wrong with fo76 is all the damn cry babies who can't handle some raiders or enclave officers going about there business.
---
If you don't want to engage with others then you need to protect yourself. Travel in a group, crouch walk so others can't see you. It's really not that hard. And if someone does find you, just server hop or fight back. The worst that's gunna happen is that you lose some caps - they aren't worth anything anyways - after which you can ignore them and go about your day. 
---
lol no. he comes with his own pistol and fancy entry music clip.
---
No. He brings his own.  He is also not great in this game.
---
Great! One of my friends had to tell me to move mine so someone else could use it. Happy to pass the info along.
---
 Got a Zealots from Phoenix last night. Now its a BoS Heavy Combat pocketed leg. ;) Soon it will be a 200% repaired one for another 10 ballistic, but I gotta hurt it first. 
---
Wait until the content drop until you start playing which drops the 12th I think. But if you really want some content wait until summer when nuclear winter drops 
---
I’ll take you places to get stuff. Tell you what to look for etc. I got you covered. All you should do right now is pick up everything and scrap it put it in your stash.
---
Honestly, I do think that nerfing TS and TSE was a good plan, they just didn't compensate anything since those were the only good legendaries.
---
2 effects shouldn't be the only good ones
---
Lol, yeah :)
---
I have deep pocket on the limbs and dense on the chest, the dense is incredible, i can stand on top of one of the exploding legendary bot's in watoga without almost getting a dent :D
---
 Yeah I go days with nothing but crap, then boom, its a few good things in a row. ;)
---
Yes, just happened to me and I’m devastated.  I got mine at level 53 so it was a level 50 and was my go to weapon and then bam gone at level 88.  Nothing I have compares and of course Bethesda can’t give the weapon back and of course I can’t run mayor for the day again.  So yeah I’m just as screwed, the RNG gods hate me and I’ll have to suffer till something drops that’s decent. 
---
LoL I play with 20% hp and Power Armor I don't like em, 1 mistake and I die :) Low HP with a full set unyielding fallout 76 armor my stats are big everything pretty much dies with a few shots. But sometimes i die in 1 place like 5-10 times and that is when I rage! But I like to have my Luck on Max so I need to bear with it. :D
---
My first launch was surprising easy. Teamed up with another player who knew enough of the process. He also was able to pretty much one shot everything in the silo. All i did was collected mainframe along the way hoping they were needed for something but not sure what. Once we destroyed the mainframe, he killed and I replaced the mainframes. After that it was just the last part to protect the bots and we used the site to get the code.i think the whole process was 40 mins. I was scared the game was going to crash but it didn't. Probably the smoothest thing i have done in the game.
---
Vault- Tec university is as good as White Springs for xp but not for legendaries
---
Slap damage caps at 5 hitpoints per second, so with semifire it takes at least 40 shots to kill somebody, much more with autofire since a lot of shots are wasted du to damage/time cap. You must have somehow ended up in PvP. 
---
Thanks for the advice. Any idea what the content is suppose be?
---
Pretty useless other than as a nice distraction when a pack of ghouls is chasing you. Also funny when he spawns midair and falls.
---
Everyone else is correct; the first time you complete Scorched Earth you get the decon shower plans as a reward
---
Lately i have had many legendary NPC's run from me. Even at WS i had 2 deathclaws take flight and had to hunt them.
---
It not worth even trying to fight the qween unless you have a coordinated team to do it.
---
Only high melee and sneak damage builds can actually do damage to her now.
---
In NV it would actually bring you to the center of the map. Totally ridiculous since they didn't even bother to put a fence or some nature at the place of the invisible wall.
---
 I had Strengthened on the Limbs for a while and I have Dense on my Chest too. I can put 40mm into a corner while standing on top of it and take no damage whatsoever.  I put Pocketed on a few Limbs and I break a leg once in a while, but still 0 damage. ;)
---
Dude the whole game is built around the perks system, you don't need to really understand too much, but you need to at least know which cards will help you, hence the build question. What cards do you currently have, maybe a screenshot of your cards would help. Mine isn't a specific build either, but I do know what I need to have a. lot of strength cards etc .. you can't really ignore the perk system and then complain about PA.
---
How many stars?
---
Except you could spend the perk points and use a better legendary effect. It all depends on how your build works. Low health bloodied builds are absolutely all about that raw damage. Sniper builds are all about that one-hit kill, they want Instigating. VATS builds who aren’t bloodied snipers might make more use of AA; non-Vats commandos probably want Two-Shot
---
Yeah i run a vats sniper build and like the fifteen luck. Between my last perk point available every option seems boring or useless.  Since i use vats 95% of the time i figure a spawning meat shield would be my best bet.  Thanks
---
I agree with what your saying 100%.  Glad you came in with a real 10mm drum. I just never seen it previously. I knew it was possible to create one, just didn’t think anyone had made it before. So therefore it couldn’t be found out in the world.  Very nice though 
---
I am mostly in to the vanguard stuff since i try to be at full health all the time, but i still have a normal polymer bos heavy left arm, so if you have any interesting left arm's i would be interested :)
---
yessss thx!
---
Another one poor guy trying to server hop for x01 Calibrated Shocks... 
---
I get that and I’m sorry if I’m unimpressed but that just doesn’t seem to be that much of a deterrent. In real life there’s jail or death penalty. So as a raider, there should be maybe a debuff that lasts for a month. Or turrets should be more effect against attacking players or both.  Most people dropped off their junk in their stash anyways, at least the good stuff.
---
I’m looking for BOS Armour I’m on PS4
---
Explosive is 20%. Demo expert adds 60% to that. So 5 pts of perks gives you 12% more total damage
---
Oh, is that what it does?  I had fought a Flatwoods Monster and a Scorchbeast at the same time and noticed the Scorchbeast was glowing purple, but I assumed they were infighting, not engaged in mind control.
---
Feel free to hit me up if you'd like :)
---
did you ask me ?
---
the one i bought for 1500 was a  vanguard 3\*  :)
---
I did have to install a "no icons on map" mod though. It took the exploring away from it since almost all big places were already marked. Now I can only see the roads.
---
Talking about this specific one:
---
[spoiler free mod on NEXUS](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/35)
---
Can still kill the queen in a couple of minutes and one shot people in pvp. Guns are fine. You just need to make sure have a good build and that your legendary effects actually compliment it. 
---
I had a 3* drop me a 3* furious explosive smg... and the sbq dropped me a 1* vampiric deathclaw gaunlet
---
Good Lord! Where is this? I need to go there myself!
---
ParadoxUnlimiTeD lvl 26 need help with quests and maybe gear :D
---
I have both but I really haven't been playing on either recently due to a new job that has odd work hours and getting new furniture in my room that doesnt really allow space for a keyboard and monitor to properly sit on top of without knocking shit around.
---
A non-sneak rifle build would probably be an automatic (commando) build. Auto Combat rifle or Handmade. You need the high RoF to make up for the lack of sneak attack damage. 
---
When the engine of the game was created multiplayer wasn’t conceptually part of the build design. This game will never succeed as a pvp game, and that’s always where it’s flaws will be. Not only that but the engine was notoriously buggy, and was exploited on a massive scale early on in the game, all the while there’s very little actual content for players looking to face a challenge outside of pvp battles with guns that formerly 1 shot people and have been one tapped High level enemies since fallout 4 (explosive shotgun were looking at you), but it came as a surprise that making a gun shoot extra projectiles AND explode would be OP. I’m not saying pvp can’t ever have a place in fallout, but in the way they went about it, no nobody asked for this. You should research Bethesda Austin vs Bethesda Maryland and how the development of this game came about. You will see why this game will never succeed as a PvP oriented game. 
---
Yes looking for 3 star BOS armour.
---
Be aware that it’s not like FO4, it won’t stay docked permanently, it returns to inventory 2 minutes after you stop using the station. (As long as you Placed the PA and didn’t Drop it)
---
But what about someone who wants to kill your character?  Isn't it unfair to him/her if he/she wants to do it and you're a passive?
---
I can do that. Much obliged partner
---
The day adrenal was broken is the same day I removed my mutations and reapplied adrenal. It’s been working fine ever since.
---
I have a GTX 1060 but a shit CPU, like an I3 or something terrible like that and don't have the money at the moment to upgrade the CPU. Is it still good enough to run 76 cause its able to run Fallout 4  fine with the only low setting being shadows, though that's only when I'm walking around inside Boston with all of the skyscrapers.
---
This appears to be my fate as I mindlessly server hop looking for X-01 Calibrated Shocks. 
---
Seems to me there is no answer. You might kill them occasionally but not as efficiently as the bloodied killing you. I have a full vanguard sentinel set with executioners weapons and its very hard to keep up with bloodied in pvp. I switched back to bloodied
---
Played last night for about 2 hours. 2 nukes were launched in that time.
---
One at Morgantown (Why? WHY?!), one at Prime.
---
Yup me too.  PS4 player got at level 53 used it as my main weapon up till a few days ago at level 88 when bam gone.  Bethesda support just gave me the sorry we haven't the tools to replace lost items.  Now I thought well maybe I accidentally sold it at the vendor as the damn lag that occurs at times has caused me to sell my handmade before, not sure why the server will jump the curser around and take something you didn't highlighted when you pressed enter.  But nope it wasn't at the vendor and I'm pretty cautious when selling for that very reason, they really need to add an extra are you sure you want to sell that favorited item pop up to give a person a chance.  Anyway it's gone and I'm super bummed as it was my main for a reason, nothing I have deals like damage and until the RNG gods (who hate me) decide to give me something I can use other than 3 star lead pipes and wood armor I'll be slowly hacking away with my level 45 fire axe 1 star that a friend gave me.  I have a serious love hate relationship with this game!

Sadly, you know someone would make an X rated one and some 12 year old would find it.

Don’t blame 76 critique on “clickbait writers” and the bag incident. This game was horrible from the jump for a plethora of reasons.
---
Just beyond me how you mention user reviews and why people were pre disposed to disliking the game, yet you completely leave out the thousands and thousands of bugs (that made this game totally unplayable in many cases) 
---
I guarantee if you made a list of all of anthems bugs it would be 1/10th of the size of the 76 list, despite anthem just releasing and 76 being out for months. 
---
&gt;The guy you're talking about was testing whether or not things were working correctly as of now, and they seemingly are.
---
The answer to the OP is still the answer. Getting killed via slap damage is no longer possible as the OP describes.  Yelling at Bethesda to fix something they already fixed does what?
---
I once got some disease from a glowing purple rock and could NOT figure it out until days later when I realized it was because of a Flatwood Monster.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/TBexcRK.png](https://i.imgur.com/TBexcRK.png) 
---
no need to wait. its working and many bugs have been fixed.
---
I have lots of fun grinding and learning new stuff in the game...its quite deep actually.
---
Don't know for sure but I have a feeling it means "chicks with dicks."
---
Don't blame the messenger.
---
So... why are you still obsessed, let go.  Move on, for your own sanity.  Stop taking it out towards us.  Kthanxbaiz
---
God man, this is just a sad whiny complaint post. 
---
As is, using happy camper rank 2 alone will make it so you only need to eat or drink after 30 minutes. If you’re at your camp then your water purifiers will be full and your crops regrown in that time, just grab some and freaking eat it and stop crying.
---
Also, if you utilize all night long rank 3 with happy camper, there will be 30 minutes of time(at night) that your hunger and thirst bar will move maybe a few percent down.
---
Whine whine whine yet the solution is so easy and practically standing right in front of you(food/water in camp, perk cards) yet you’re too lazy to consider those options and demand the game is badly designed and just trying to make it hard on you.
---
What a crybaby.
---
I'm hoping with one of the updates we get some good clutter. I want bar items, but also books, comics, coffee cups, weapons, tools, etc. 
---
If you're not sure whats useful getting the crafting perks leveled up as soon as you get them is something I do in those early levels when there isn't as many helpful perks to get. Getting three star first aid is probably the best investment across the board, same for the better prices perk.
---
And hopefully they'll make camp budgets higher for all this clutter so I don't have to have a tiny base with 3 boos. 
---
This would be ridiculously resource expensive and time consuming to implement unfortunately.
---
Thank you sir I appreciate your input 
---
Yes this!
---
Thank you dude 
---
I encountered one aswell at whitesprings, i shot it to pieces. 
---
Fully automatic weapons will give you more chances to avoid Serendipity. A 10mm pistol for example will put 7 rounds towards the enemy per second. Stack criticals and sneak attacks and it only takes one hit to drop them.
---
Nuka cola paint should be your first mod for t51b ;)
---
Spawns will only happen when a new player zones into the area.  If you have the server to yourself, nothing will spawn if you stay in the same spot
---
The camp was not blocking the spawns. That's not how the game works.
---
All Rise for melee (I actually have 2...was lucky enough to find one sold to the enclave vendor once and snatched it up.)  I also am partial to Civil Unrest for my shotgun needs. For sniping, I favor a suppressed .50 sniper rifle with long recon scope. General run and gun, I use a Zealot's Lever Action which gives +30% against scorched.
---
They've fixed server crashing issues. A healthy amount of other bugs are still here (enemies in walls, can't open pipboy before world loads). No new content at all, but some little things on the way. First update just adds beer  crafting and vending, but neither of those really appear to do anything to actually make the endgame worth it (why craft alcohol? For what purpose? And why vend items when there's nothing new to progress towards with your new items?)
---
If you got bored before then you'll probably be in the same boat
---
great place to load up on chems, especially with the pharma farma perk equipped. 
---
I take you don't know how taming works. But it's still the best way to keep your fred alive.
---
Lab coat is pretty damn common at the antique store, medical goggles are a lot rarer. I think the senior scribe? Might have the wrong name.  Is much rarer. I think I’ve gotten 2 in like at least a hundred tech doc turnins 
---
Man this will suck if they are back. Why I mean Dupe, why cheat? Its just killing the game. But I don't think they are back I don't remember the last time I saw "server not responding" (PC). 
---
What plans do you have? Higher level power armor plans are what I’m looking for
---
Probably because he had 100+ bobbleheads stacked so his damaged was buffed through the roof. I got 1 hit like this by a level 71 at level 112, he was totally naked and used a board and he 1 shot me with slap damage three times lol 
---
Cheaters man..
---
In PVE, yes. Chameleon had a stealth bonus in PVE, each piece stacks that up. 
---
Because this is the only subreddit (that I know of) that Bethesda CMs frequent, and I want them to know that not everyone is a fucking fanatic over this shit game and to make it right by either fixing it or giving me a goddammed well deserved refund. Sorry if you can't see what a fucking train wreck of a product this is like the majority of people. I had high hopes for this amd still believe it can work, if they would focus more on making it work and less on taking more money from our wallets.
---
Well a lot of it comes down to me being able to spare the cash for it, soon at least. As well as needing another MMO (or MMO type game) to fill my time since WoW is in a rough spot right now.
---
Plus browsing this sub and seeing people on the dev team (at least I assume they're on it) interacting with the community and sharing their genuine love of the game and universe has given me a lot of hope for 76 that the videos bandwagoning how it's the worst thing ever created had taken from me.
---
I think most people are pretty understanding with friendly fire when clearing the golf club.  I've shot, and been shot, several times and then we all look at each other and begin emoting.
---
BTW, we desperately need a "I shot you on accident" emote. "
---
exactly, i'm now hording leg's waiting for the new vendors. Space is still a problem because i still have not decided what i really need. I use to go through screws and springs, and now i have 500 of each...b/c i changed my PA build.
---
Dont really want to sell/drop them JIC i go to a diff. build.
---
Me, 200hrs I to the game: the what room? 😐
---
The number of people server hopping for stuff like Fusion Cores and Lead had reached the point where workshops/mining are worth taking as an alternative.
---
Question: if I have a workshop and am crouched, but not hidden, like if a super mutant sees me, am I still off the map?
---
I'm encountering a glitch on Xbox One where I cannot grow my blueprint selections more than a few extra walls and foundations.
---
This happened to me and my buddy a couple of weekends ago, and also, there was nuclear flora everywhere despite the fact that no one had nuked the place.  It didn't stop, the legendaries just kept respawning even though other players rarely came through the area and like 75% of the enemy spawns were legendary.  
---
We just killed and killed and killed robots and ghouls for hours until we were sick of it.  I ended up with about 50 legendary items that day, and some of the ones I got off the lv. 1 Eyebots I passed off to my Lv. 2 alt which I haven't really started playing with yet.  Took me 3 nights of vendor runs just to dump all the garbage.
---
Toward the end of that session we ran down a hill at the edge of Whitesprings and someone had their camp on the green - they had a stage outside with a bunch instruments set up and there were a few other randoms there and we all just started up a 5 piece jam out of nowhere.
---
Overall it was the best day in FO76 I've ever had.
---
I'd fart on one. 
---
Thank you Man I didn’t know that about automatic weapons 
---
Legendary Purveyor is released May 23rd. More than 2 months away still.
---
Has definitely increased your odds?
---
Have you ever heard of a coincidence? 
---
Got any high level power mods, or plans for em? Calibrated shocks would be a godsend
---
15 people is a lot. If there's more than 8 I don't usually join the fight. 
---
If she appears to stop taking damage it is usually because half the server has just shown up and they simply aren't pulling their weight.
---
I have the same problem on Xbox One
---
Lucky you, put in 14 hours on Saturday and one nuke dropped.
---
Exactly this. I have tested between using 8 luck, and 30 luck with unyielding armor. No difference in drops, except all items you find with durability, you will find at 200% durability.
---
Because if you're not playing the game for "hours", maybe turn it off and let someone else have that server spot. 
---
I have spent a lot of time building camps, it doesn't take much to exit build mode, eat a soup, and go back in once every 15 minutes or whatever. 
---
Everyone hangs out at their camp, yeah, but not for "hours", what would the point of that be? 
---
Welcome to my world! I’m level 155 I think. Haven’t finished joining the Enclave. Haven’t discovered about 1/3 of map. Haven’t completed main story line. 
---
In Fallout 4, I was Overboss if Nuka World and Level 120 before I even started looking for Shaun, so this is no surprise. 
---
Fallout games are what you make of them. ;-)
---
He duped the violet flux. You're going to be banned.
---
Not my issue.  I have been attacked, (in and out of PA), but it's taken  a dozen or so shots before I needed to stimpak.  
---
It varies wildly.
---
- Is it heavy? These are more in demand.
---
- What is the prefix? Unyielding is VERY popular since Bloodied is the most synergised (albeit dangerous) build in the game right now. Bolstering is also very valuable, as is Chameleon (but people typically only want one piece. Vanguard can be good too, if you have the right piece. Assassin's is a PVP piece, and needs to be usually paired with Cavalier or (more commonly) Sentinel to be worth much. Other affixes are usually junk, but I think Mutant's is the most overlooked in the game - have not tested this!
---
- What are the secondaries? - AP refresh is awesome with all kinds of stuff. Dodgy for the up-close people, but it really shines with VATS builds, currently the rifleman meta.
---
- What are the tertiaries? - These may not belong here (it's a tricky system to figure out, logic was not at home that day), but Cavalier and Sentinel (as above), and any form of weight reduction. Weapon weight in particular is REALLY nice, since there are no perks for riflemen, and rifles are fucking HEAVY.
---
Short answer.....there are no average prices :/ I'm sorry that I don't have a quick answer for you, but it's a fact. However, if you want to make money trading, look for the stuff above. If you want to flesh out a really effective suit, see above. You see why these are kinda the same? :)
---
Hope this helped, please feel free to chat back if you have questions - I'll do my best!
---
ahhh the first whitespring experience..its always exciting and scary...i farm there ALL the time..,and i still dont really go into those houses on the outskirts..they scare me lol..u will figure that place out..i learn something new everyday there..levels dont really matter..u just have to know how to protect yourself..make sure you stash all your junk..and you are good to go 
---
100% agree. Not only is this my favorite Fallout map, it ranks as #1 in every other open world game I have played.
---
Largely agree if you put it like that. Do note the developpers stated in advance this particular game is a big experiment so at least it shouldn't be a surprise there are issues. Despite its flaws, I've had extremely interesting fights, that matched experiences I had in pvp games like Eve online and the older Battlefields. I'm forced to use my brain a lot in order to defeat players with better weapons and gear than me or when I'm outnumbered. For me personally that's where a lot of the fun is.
---
Did this over the weekend. It was nice to try someplace new and not have it be a waste of time. I don’t think I saw a single legendary though, you’re right. 
---
same when i ever i try and load in the game when i first boot it up it just sits on the loading screen for ever doesnt do anything even tho the falllout symbol in the corner is spinning 
---
I love the mental image of a guy being hounded by a bunch of skinless people and he's like, "Guys, hold on a sec I need to post this to Reddit", and the scorched just stop and wait.
---
180 hours. Missed this room too I guess...
---
I actually think cavaliers better but its just the current buzzword for meta gear
---
Enjoy that memory, it’ll be another 50 levels before you see him again. 
---
Perhaps something in another country would work. Europe or Canada would be my choice, but China could definitely be interesting. It could open up the doors to brand new factions, tons of new lore, and a setting unlike any we’ve seen before. I know considering Fallout is a parody of American consumerism it’ll likely never happen, but I would sure love it if it did
---
Gnits gna gnome
---
I know right, were not going to not notice it within an hour of being back online, and know exactly what they did by the end of the day.
---
I got bladed commie whacker plans from one of the strikebreaker bots over by beckley 
---
Mmm no. Because that’s what plenty of other games have to offer. And this is a mmo style game, thus you get rewarded for time invested.
---
The armor and weapons and perks are all a part of the design of Fallout, without it, it wouldn’t be Fallout pvp, it would just be any other bland and boring pvp game with no reward for time invested.
---
Lucky Break and the other one that procs for armour repair and weapon repair are awesome.
---
Armour Penetration is hilariously useful.
---
Bloody Mess adds a straight % to damage, lets you top up your damage without specialising too much.
---
Hacker/Lockpick are handy, but swap in and out as needed TBH.
---
My 1 piece of advice weapons wise? Don't spec for handguns, my best ended up being a level 5 somerset special for waaay too long. 
---
Weight reduction perks are a case by case for me, it depends how you play.
---
Damage Resist perks can be good, but some perks require you not to be in Power Armour. Which I tend to end up in because it's just too handy.
---
I'll try and post my nukes &amp; dragons character design later.
---
Bethesdas level designers/world builders are great! 😊💚
---
That's like saying it's unfair to a robber for wanting to rob you when you don't want to be robbed
---
The plan is dropped by Queen of the Hunt daily quest in the mire 
---
I’d just be happy for a ‘bulk all’ button. Maybe allow me do deselect a couple things like plastic, steel, and wood
---
True, but we got what we got and there’s isn’t really much changing that. We have to enjoy what we were given, even if it wasn’t perfect
---
 My “take” is that Public Workshops are not worth the effort unless you have a team of lvl100+ friends helping you hold it long enough to even break even with the cost of the workshop, plus the ammo used to clear it balanced against the meager rewards for doing the defense events.  The “Nerf” to workshop contesting means I can contest a workshop from anywhere “on the property” and if I can use stealth, and hide pretty well no-one can keep hold of it.  So I watch for a defend event, travel to it, if it is close, shoot a single mole rat while inside the event border and then just wait until the end of the event, only killing what tries to hurt me.   Very little risk, and a decent reward for 4 minutes of work, and a bit of wear on my machete (only use melee weapons so no risk of getting wanted, or inadvertently contesting the workshop).
---
We have a winner, thanks man, saved me a lot of haste 👍
---
I have listened to enough players over their mic to know that allowing them to leave holotapes for other players will definitely come to NO GOOD.
---
Yup I just had 2 higher level players try to pvp me at my camp, and they wouldn't take no for an answer. I think one of them had a TSA weapon but it took a while to do any damage to me. I just let them both get the wanted and then jumped servers because I didn't want them wrecking my camp. The exact reason I dont like taking workshops, but honestly this was the first time I've encountered people like this.
---
Shit, I know what I'm doing the next time I play.  Marsupial powers for the win!
---
Haven’t read any comments yet, but allow me to say that I’m level 155 I think and haven’t even finished joining Enclave yet. Military wing is still locked. Loving the game though. Just caught up in Legendary farming, camp building, and caps!
---
The glitches and crashes left a bad taste in people’s mouths. Bethesda didn’t handle it that great and people aren’t that open-minded anymore. It’ll likely always stay that way, but it’s still fun
---
I was able to get them at the time but if it weren’t for my friend who told me about it, I would’ve missed it.
---
I noticed the "Leader of the Pack" event in the forest had a high legendary spawn rate and I got some low level  legendaries from it (one was a level 1 3 star armor.)  I left them in the overseer CAMP for a low level to pick up.
---
Why would you drop them at all unless you are giving them away or discarding them. I have every suit , I take them out to work on them . I place them down, I put the ones I'm not actively working on back in the stash. I can only mod/repair one at a time. I only drop if I'm selling a whole suit.
---
What platform are you playing on? But I would recommend to keep going with the main quest, gear up and thing will get interesting once you hit level 50+. But tip number one build your playstyle (build) at the very start or later on you will face difficulties. Use fallout 76 build calculator. I use nukadragons. I currently focus on finding outfits :) it's fun, if you want we can look for the. Together but I play on PC.
---
Is the marine assault combat helmet in the game finally?
---
Wait, you can lock the port-o-johns?  Why is this not more common knowledge!
---
Have three server choices at log-in:
---
Pacifist/co-op
---
Roleplay (make PvP similar to ESOs challenge/duel system)
---
PvP. 
---
This. 
---
Too much opportunity for some sick and twisted stuff to be recorded and just left out there for someone to find. 
---
Yes, it could be done in voice chat as well. But at least then you have someone nearby (hopefully) telling the individual how sick and twisted they are and reporting it. 
---
Imagine you come across a holo tape that has been recorded and it sounds like someone is being tortured/murdered/etc. Is it someone roleplaying a raider, or did someone really just create a tape of them doing something horrible to someone? 
---
From a technical and design standpoint they would have to allocate server space to save player created audio, implement a system where holotapes dropped by players persisted in the game world until found, have a way to track who created each tape and when (for numerous reasons, but most of all potential legal liability in a case like mentioned above), be ready to comply with legal investigations if necessary, and this list could go on and on.
---
Also, imagine the potential for just trolling/griefing. Somebody drops hundred of holotapes in the middle of your base with just obnoxious screaming, moaning, babies crying, w/e. You are gonna have to pick all those up just to get rid of them. Then if they persist when dropped, how do you get rid of them? Eventually beautiful WV looks like a landfill of holo tapes or you set a limited lifespan that people complain is too short or too long. 
---
TLDR: A cool concept, but way too many potential issues to be worth it. 
---
And further on this, if you only have 1 core, you will load it and it will only show 1 shot, you shoot that and it'll reload and have the correct amount, it does not use-up the first core in a single go.
---
I was gonna say, that is some shitty design for an online game, for those leveling up.  I will stay in the lower zones for a while longer.  Thank you for the info!
---
Here is a map with the suggested levels for each area. You can go anywhere you want at any level. The higher levels are going to have harder enemies. That is good and bad. You level up faster and may die more.
---
https://i.redd.it/jhvfm956wdx11.png
---
If you are on a PC and me as a friend. I will help you level up quickly. By damaging higher level enemies so that you can finish them off. My IGN is the same as here.
---
I think Whitesprings Lost and Found would be perfect for this. Whisprings service robots have found loot while wandering the wastelands and managed to associate it with you, and now it waits to be claim with the lost and found service. If you set up a delivery drone platform in your camp they can deliver it there directly for you, curtesy of Whitesprings.
---
Explore the green area of the map - aka the Forest.  
---
You should also be able to spend some time in the northern part, aka Toxic Valley.  You should be able to do Path of the Wind if no high levels have been around.
---
Collect and scrap low level weapons, earn XP, complete side quests and missions - you should see these appear as you explore/re-explore various locations on the map.
---
Learn what weapons are the most effective against which enemies.
---
Learn the lore and the backstory.  find the visual gags.
---
Build your character.   You need to get to around L30 before  exploring the right side or bottom of the map.
---
You can start using Raider power armor at L15.  You should have discovered some PA by now, but you need fusion cores to run it...
---
and a couple perks for energy consumption efficiency.  (You will be able to upgrade to a new class of PA armor about every 5 levels.)
---
Yes! Loved me all those mirrors
---
Have no idea :) I know combat helmet is. I found it once. This is why looking for a legit source. Would be great if Bethesda made a list of items that can be found, bought etc. Like official database, but do NOT show their location, allow players like me to know what items exist and let me find it... :) fashion maniac hehe
---
I have the audio/mic issue, which can be super annoying. We have a thing, though, if the other person doesn't talk for a while we use the "radiation sick" emote to tell the other person to check their phone messages. Stupid we have to have a work around like that, but Bugthesda.
---
I don't the team creation issue, I can do that from the social tab or in person.  (so far, knock on wood)
---
I just made a field of corn and tato, then built a big square of foundations around it, I believe it was 5x5, could be wrong... then walled it off on the outside, roofed it, and locked the doors.
---
Spiky melon nets sounds much more fun though!
---
So apparently trying to have a discussion with you turned into some crazy outbursts.  No reason to discuss it further trying to reason with an unreasonable individual. 
---
The reality is your not getting private servers, not now, likely not ever.  Good luck to you though out there, try maybe being a little less confrontational in the future for better results with life.
---
balistic fiber, caps, and adhesive are all easy to obtain in large qauntities in a few hours
---
I wish they'd separate servers. 
---
Literally any laser weapon. 
---
^(This ^is ^terrible ^advice.)
---
Yet all test show it is not possible to buff through the roof. Every test that can be replicated shows it is impossible to do more than slap damage. Every person who wants to remove PvP have an anecdotal story that cannot be replicated about how it is broken. 
---
I don't like PvP and even avoid Workshops unless it is part of Daily/Weekly challenges. But not any test done show slap damage can be broken through (now days, a few patches back is was broken af).
---
I either sell mine to a vendor for crap caps, give it to a lower level character, or dump it in a Overseer's cache. 
---
This past Saturday I spent 8 hours farming that exact location and got all the civil war ear plans:   
---
1. Civil War Era Dress
---
2. Civil War Era Suit
---
3. Civil War Era Top Hat
---
4. Confederate Hat
---
5. Confederate Uniform
---
6. Union Hat
---
7. Union Uniform
---
Again... It took 8 HOURS of nonstop server jumping.
---
Thank you, luckily I did use nuladragons and settled on a build when I first started. I’m on Xbox but thanks for the offer!
---
I have seen a screenshot of it being still alive, but as far as I know it wasn't interactable (though wasn't hostile). Seems like if it's going to be an event it's not quite finished yet.
---
You should invest in ammosmith and super duper. Vital for most non melee builds. Adrenaline and bloody mess as well. That’s all I got.
---
Sorry man.  I feel your pain.  Once you level up, the 2* All Rise isn’t always the best in your toolkit (hopefully)... so hopefully a kind high-leveler might be willing to hand theirs down.   
---
On that note, I kinda like how the All Rise has almost become a hand-me-down in this game.   Seen a lot of people pass theirs on to the lower levelers. 
---
Oh no I know all of its bugs and I know they did a lazy job with it.  They know their issues one person is not going to stand out you are not special.  Just let go
---
Thank you! This is very helpful!
---
r/market76 
---
My place needs a toaster. 
---
I've given stuff to noobs there, but maybe they hadn't heard about griefers yet lol. I do have a mic and say I'm giving them stuff, though. But that could be a trap too. Sigh.
---
I *think* so, but I havent tested myself or really seen anyone on reddit test it yet.
---
I have a TS western lvl 40 and
---
a lvl 50 3\* western
---
Awesome what’s the 3* one? 
---
Man anyone I ask are ways on xbox:) yeah building is cool, I will start building soon too, since was farming plans for camp like crazy. Now I think I can build something good.
---
Happened to me. I was in the event at least, but she never got under half heath and we were pumping her full of bullets. Was really frustrating. All those bullets for NOTHING.
---
If your on Xbox I have about seven of them if you want one.
---
Don’t worry too much if you mess up now. After level 50 you can move special points around to suit your needs. Power armour is good but it tends to itself to heavy gun and one man army styles. You can still play them and not do that too. 
---
Same, only been to the BoS place needed for the quest in there, but i know there are a nasty surprise on one of the floors, that place is great, probably one of the best in the game :)
---
I like them up at Morgantown.  The mobs are broken up into smaller groups, and there are a shitload of nuked flora to pick. Think of it as a kiddie nuke zone.  
---
I didn't know I was so lucky until I saw people's comments here!
---
Introducing that would negate the perk card... It's a different system, not an introduction of a new mechanic. What you're suggesting would break the current system. Those cards would be useless now. That's why people are referencing other games. I don't think you understand that what you're suggesting would just be changing how the game works. completely. 
---
Have to wait and see. No idea what will come b
---
I don't know about no legendaries since she is endgame, but otherwise I completely agree with you. 
---
Doesn't remove rads, but prevents rads from eating and drinking.  Doesn't protect from disease.
---
*You* my friend, are why I say "*Almost* Never".
---
From what I read, I need rank 3 of the Animal Friend perk. Fred isn't worth that much to me. 
---
In my experience, Level 116, the budget is the same no matter what, currently. I tested this by building the same exact max budget house on my high level and a new charcter.
---
How can you tell it’s working?
---
Or right, we got to go back to the grind...  As much as I love this game, it's 80% grind for mats
---
Because I had five suits and some of them had mismatched pieces and whatnot so I wanted to look at all of them and see what was what. I didn't know about the empty power armor glitch or whatever it is. I only ever used my excavator so I had kind of forgotten what they all were.
---
Good luck. If you stick to the forest and toxic valley you shouldn't run into anything much higher than level 20ish.
---
Also, if you're on xbox and still need to get the sword from WS I'll play body guard for a few minutes.
---
Claiming workspace is a great way to earn XP and plans, even if you don't need the resources. The 30 caps you spend to claim is easily recouped by selling the weapons, cheeks, etc that you'll pick up defending the place. 
---
If someone comes to contest it just let them have it or jump servers to avoid getting sucked into PvP. 
---
Yah I'm not much for pvp. I actually spend my time as a vendor
---
It definitely is a game where you have to find and make your own fun. But at the same time I find it to be such a game that gives you really nice toolset of things to make fun out of it. Exploration is superb.
---
If you crash or get disconnected before the climax, just remember, this is completely normal and can happen to anyone.
---
Thanks so much but I'm on Xbox
---
Ironclad is not a must and imo not worth the investment to the point I would call it a trash perk card.
---
Solar shield is not worth the points, and dodgy is only viable if you don’t use vats at all.
---
250 damage resist while aiming
---
a VATS hit chance
---
I cant remember the last one.
---
very cool weapon...got it from a Ghoul at WS.
---
yes, let me go organise a militia in a game with no text chat.
---
Penderecki!  That piece is in my permanent playlist.
---
There is no concrete evidence to suggest this either way, it purely speculation and false information. As fas we know, budget does not increase when you level up regardless of what people say. Your budget is the same at level 5 and level 50. One guy took two characters, one at level 5 and one at level 50 and built a set amount on each character, you was able to build the same amount.
---
It's unfortunate we limited, but we hoping there will be an update to the camping system that will eventually give us more budget.
---
Yeah learher armor, any intrest? 
---
Rule 1: Most YouTubers have hopped on the Hate Bandwagon because they'll get fried in the comments if they actually like the game.  If you want honest, mostly unbiased, play by plays, check out Oxhorn's channel.  He'll tell you if something sucks, and if something is great. Best part is, he actually spends hours playing the game, not just a few minutes here and there before tossing up a "Fallout 76 sucks" video.  
---
Hopefully you got the tinfoil hat as well.
---
That's not the point. The point is numerous times she just wont die. 
---
Ahh right okay! Still good!
---
They don't receive your level in caps, they only receive the bounty. This is a well-known tactic to save caps in pvp, especially if you're high level. Have been on both the giving and receiving end of this.
---
Good stuff how much are looking for it? 
---
A report system, holotapes are tied to an account and if content is deemed offensive all those who passed it on will be suspended and the original uploader banned.
---
There could be a set limit of say 3 per day. Maybe they are only on one server, and after 24 hours it disappears unless it's in the marketplace on sale. Players could make stuff like "mothman commeth" and sell a few caps for it.
---
You got all the mutation perks already? 
---
I have gobs of legendaries in my stash. Some are low level and being saved for a future character or selling/giving away. Some are for trading. Some are there if I decide to try a different build,  medics or suppressive or something. Some I'm just saving for friends. 
---
I have a whole different load out for fighting the queen, a couple heavy prime guns. 
---
Most of my stash is filled with three or four legendary effects. Bloodied, furious, two shot and/or explosive, anti armor.
---
I still constantly find stuff i havent seen &lt;3
---
I did my very first SBQ fight last night at lvl 88.  We didn't get her even  an eighth of the way down before we failed.  We never even hit the regen. It was a gear check for me to be sure, but from what I was seeing, everyone else looked to have decent weapons.  
---
Ok thanks
---
&gt;Someone damaged your camp? griefing asshole.
---
Ok, on this specific example I'd say doing this unprovoked absolutely makes you a griefing asshole. 
---
Maybe if you see a base with turrets and a tamed deathclaw guarding it, and people are there. That could at least be a fun battle that everyone would probably enjoy.
---
The other's are totally fair game. That's PvP and can even lead to rewards. 
---
There's no reward for blowing up someone's defenseless base.
---
This is the build I'm currently running with, plus the side deck: [Link](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f373e86&amp;d=sq2s32sr2s22ic4ip2ih2id2s72ls2lt2a04pe2cu2sg2eh2e12e60&amp;w=e00es2c52ik0e82at1lm2iq2p90p80pa0&amp;n=Hevy%20Waponz)
---
It doesn't really become amazing until the late game, but when it does, it's great fun.
---
I hear these stories all the time, but have yet to encounter anyone grief me in such a way. Sucks that this stuff happens even on this game! Has a 3 vs 3 during the beta by a wanted baiter, but we won that. People seem pretty chill normally! It will be good once pvp mode comes out, to siphon out the dicks.
---
So what shotgun do you think is best?  I've been considering my play style after getting over my frustrated tiff and brushing off the snider comments here, and I tend to try and get up close and personal with things when my sneak cover is blown.  I just can't seem to get enough damage out of guns to kill things fast enough for them not to be in my face anyway, so i figure cut out the middle man and bring the fight to them.  I also busted my ass to get my claws on the handmade rifle plans and made/scrapped a bunch to learn mods for them...  But shotguns are supposed to be medium to close range weapons, and given my current play style-- that is, charge in and start swinging until nothing is moving-- I think they would be a good fit.
---
&gt; A lot of people like to just AFK in their base for hours
---
Why would you want to be afk for hours?  Why not just quit the game and log back in when you're ready to play again?
---
Don't apologize, this was very well written and thought out! Thanks for your perspective!
---
Follow the main quest line to get going, I know initially can be confusing and overwhelming. Open Pip-Boy, scroll over to Data and look at your quests under main. Do those, don't worry about side quests for now.
---

---
Also do your daily and weekly challenges for free atoms. Go to Map, then to the main menu (LB on XB1), under Challenges, complete daily and weekly challenges, this in itself will keep you super busy.
---
Is there a perk that deals straight armour penetration? As I have only seen the rifle version.
---
Shame about the handguns as I was looking forward to a revolver build.
---
 But please do would be great to see! And sorry what do you mean by dragons?
---
The marketplace could be run on a separate server than the main world, like have us load into a vault or something that we can expand and make shops and stuff, since it's a vault its modular so any growth gets tied to the client so when one person leaves their shop goes with, kinda like a camp. There are small, medium and large lots for all types of shops and entertainment/socializing. 
---
Yeah
---
I had four leaf clover and grim sprint maxed but they've been broke for the last two patches.  I've since readjusted my build and between psycho being broke also not liking ricochet and the reload one it's kind of down to serendipity or mysterious stranger
---
SBQ has been bugged once in my last 10 matches, we killed her 9 out of 10. 2 to 15 people.
---
Ok, I'm a noob, but why?  My turrets at my camp don't give me that much xp and I can't loot the corpses so what's the point?
---
A cheater is a cheater. Punishment is deserved.
---
 BTW That link is missing the western outfit with chaps it seems
---
Ignore the other guy. You won't get banned for 30 of an item - its stupid to suggest you would.
---
It’s for the fact of knowing you can do something. 
---
Also a lot of dupers said  they dupe so that BGS will see the error they left in the game code. Some care and hope that and others just want caps and to remain higher on the totem pole. Status quo never changes. 
---
I'm camped very near there, I stumbled upon it by accident and now I check it every time I log in.  I can now make the entiere confed uniform, and the top hat.  
---
If it were possible I would suggest using a ladder or possibly a chair instead of your bare hands.
---
You just need to have it on when you tame it,not forever.
---
It’s a new crafting system with a theme on booze, moonshine and the likes. 
---
Keep an eye out for a vats matrix overlay mod for your power armor helmet.
---
I experienced my first mine yesterday. I was at grafton I think. I walked up to it and next thing I know ohh hesr the sound. I have marsupial so I quickly jumped out of the way. I was on a team and I was laughing. He was like what's going on? Told h I'll m a mjnr was on the workshop. That  was awesome.
---
They selfishly want to have the legendaries killed without lifting a finger, even though the rest of the server misses out.
---
Can't count how many times I've heard turrets out the back and found dead legendaries I can't loot.
---
I've had that for ages. 
---
I noticed reading through the thread you like melee over guns, so here’s my advice.
---
There is a legendary effect you can get on armor called Cavalier (take 15% less dmg while sprinting), a full set of this will make you take 75% less damage while sprinting and with this most enemies will hit you 1hp.
---
Now this effect only comes on three star legendary armor and will take you some time to build a full set, but it is doable, I have found/bought a full set of cavalier armor, sentinel armor, and assassin/sentinel armor, in my time playing.
---
Perk cards you will want to invest into for defense are blocker rank 3 and barbarian rank 3, and evasive rank 3 if your agility is decent(10+).
---
If you decide to go with cavalier you will also want to maximize the time your character can sprint, this means get marathoner rank 3 and custom fitted mods on both your legs, also action boy 3 will help the ap regen.
---
In the past couple weeks I started a character with the cavalier build after getting kinda bored with my sentinel build main character. And I have been loving it, while sprinting I usually take 0 dmg or 1-2 hp dmg from enemies, I play at 30% health bloodied melee and can 1 shot almost everything, including players with full sentinel builds.
---
But if it's a turret kill they can't loot them can they?
---
This is MVP level!  I congratulate you on your innovation and inspiration.  I hope we see more people doing this!  WTG!
---
BTW: ppl dont like to trade due to losers stealing your stuff....caps eliminates that problem.
---
ive seen this a number of times, and it always seems to happen right after a nuke expires.  for some reason bots (including protectrons etc) will spawn instead of ghouls.  i wonder if this is intentional.
---
Not everyone has that experience. 
---
Happens alot at the thunder mountain workshop too, except they get stuck way below the ground 
---
No, no, no, no, soom^TM
---
Hey u/Val_Hallen,
---
There is a fix for this planned in the next patch. 
---
I will certainly be adding you later today!  This is awesome!
---
A bench. I need a bench.
---
[I'd settle for a ladder though.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrRFzwPE0d4)
---
I'm just ignorant.  Instead of telling me to go play something else, please either give me advice for what I actually asked for, or don't comment.  
---
I admit my ignorance. I'm not great at planning stuff like this.  What I am asking for is advice.  Not to be told to go play something else.  Someone suggested shotguns, and I think they';re on to something. My current "build" is charging in and swinging All Rise until everything is dead.  I would like to keep doing that, or something similar, without power armor.
---
I have tried doing ranged, but I can't get enough damage out of basic ranged weapons to kill things before they're up in my face anyway, so as previously stated in another comment, I simply cut the middle man and get in their face first.  This is what I need help with.  A way to do that without power armor.
---
I'll take you up on that for sure.   I keep forgetting it's a multiplayer game, hah.  The biggest challenge for me so far has been finding weapons I can't use, and constantly running out of inventory.   I also haven't gotten any lock pick or hacking cards since early so I keep getting blocked out of buildings, sigh.
---
One great way to them is to go to the top of the world area and collect all tic can chimes theres atleast 7 chimes and each have i think 6 cans on them 
---
Have you tried turning it off and on. 
---
Personally like shotguns because of the cripple chance. It is entertaining to cripple both of a deathclaw's legs and watch it stare angrily at you as you move back and forth just outside of it's reach. 
---
Another fun mini game is to go to whitespings and take the legs out on ghouls, then leave the area and see how long it takes for someone to come by and kill them. You'll know from the random experience gain when you're off minding your own business. 
---
Also, when it comes to SB fights you can take them out of the air really well. This will make you melees best friend during SBQ fights.

---
If you find a dishrag its all over.
---
Yes that’s fine as long as it’s three star 
---
Yea it's the first time I've encountered it since beta but it wasnt that big of a deal just a quick server hop. But I wouldn't call that grieving it was more like flies buzzing around. Once I got on the new server just slept to recoup the little bit of lost health.  And yea the community is great, I just encountered a newbie by 76 so I dropped some radx, rad away, purified water and stimpaks waved and walked off.
---
In the game? No. In the real world? Yes. J.Q Dickenson salt-works. It's a 300ish foot deep salt brine extraction company
---
Just any old "toxic water" won't do. I've got a real life toxic pond near my house, and if you want to boil that down for mercury go right ahead. You won't get eatable salt. 
---
Firecracker berries might be some strange mutation of real world peppers, so yeah, that's a viable option for spices...though there aren't any native species to west virginia I'm aware of. But sure, i can see the logic in that...for spices. Not for "pepper". 
---
You won't get a real nuka cola (and that drove me fucking crazy, by the by) out of materials from that area. You WILL find everything you need for sarsaparilla. 
---
I haven't really had a problem with other players killing Steakums, but wandering Scorched and Muties target him every now and then.
---
Where does a level 48 get that much Violet Flux? And why did he take the pieces and not the frame? If he thought the flux was heavy...
---
The energy ammo weight reduction perk works on fusion cores. Its a better alternative than the high level one that doubled duration. At least for managing weight. One fusion core would weigh 0.3 pounds. 
---
I recommend getting it early on if you plan on using power armor extensively. For getting the cores you can easily take a powerplant workshop one night and grab a ton from that, they tend to last awhile. You can always server hop as well. 
---
You can mix and match the fusion core cards but normally its overkill. I used my power armor for 5 hours last night and only used up two cores when I added in home many I got back from loot. And with batteries included? (Energy ammo weight reducer) i can easily lug around 15-30 fusion cores and it not affect me too badly.
---
While standing on the platform at R&amp;G TS I saw one up on the hill behind it. Shot it once at distance and it teleported to me. I took him out easily when he appeared. That was about a week ago. Haven't seen one since.
---
Makeshift warrior is meh, I don't find I have to repair that much. I would go 3 points INT for weapon artisan to get a damage boost on over repairing your unarmed weapons. You can still go 3/5 makeshift or 3 of several other things like pharmacist or whatever the stimpak perk in int is.
---
Bloody mess in the Luck tree is an absolute must have, the 15% damage is calculated last so you can the biggest damage boost from that perk than from almost any. Would also suggest even 1 card of adrenaline over ninja. Also recommend lifegiver over ironclad as HP is worth more and harder to get than DR and it's worth it to have a bunch more HP than to save like 2 HP per hit.
---
And as you play the game, you'll find areas you, personally, enjoy re-visiting that have good mobs and loot. 
---
I get all my legendary weapons and armor from places that aren't the "common farming spots". Because I've explored and found areas that do ok, for me, without all the competition and griefers. 
---
I’ve gotten the rare red nurse outfit there. I use the hat with my Camden park outfit 
---
No! My precious.... 
---
I have experienced the audio issue, too. Usually I hear a loud slam kind of like a super sledge hitting something while someone is doing a superman landing. Often I play with a group larger than 4. So we use Discord to team talk. We have had audio issues with Disord too. Grant it was only once. After we all disconnected the call. We reconnected and did not have any issues the rest of the time.
---
&gt; As for griefers, who cares? 
---
You didn't? Because that's the comment I replied to. 
---
Thanks for the info :) good thing I have caps 
---
Not sure (never done it) but maybe they sit on top and fire a couple of shots? Not sure. I just find dead legendaries and turrets out there.
---
It took so long he turned into scorched.
---
there are no 4 star enemies and the highest number of stars that can be dropped are 3. u can get 4 by adding the scorched killers reveiver or the sacrificial blade on a machete
---
I've had this too. I took some photos crouching with their bodies.
---
Radshield and radx-diluted combined can make the gamma gun do little radiation damage.
---
Plus any good bloodied build user packs radaway on their hotkeys.
---
And the key thing you’re forgetting, they likely need 1 shot on you to kill you, your gamma gun will take at least 3-4, and with radshield and radx-diluted more like 7-8.
---
I know I can’t ever loot anything my turrets kill at my base.  Either way, we agree it is still annoying.
---
That's great, I'm just now at lvl 70 and I'm working on my Officer On Deck part, so I hope to launch a Nuke this weekend coming up at least.
---
you don't get XP, but the corpses are lootable.
---
before the workshop change, i'd always get the junkyard and build a turret base next to the road where 90% of the waves come through.
---
Nah, I'm just a simple troll that thinks it's stupid to lock a camp. So I engage in not-so-passive aggression to make a point that's completely lost on my subject.
---
5, you dc far and few times now, servers a lot more stable. 
---
I don’t think I’ve ever been able to loot a turret kill. 
---
No
---
3 star highest still
---
Sort of. You can load in a server where someone has a camp in your spot, but if you go to another server with no one there, your camp will be fine.
---
Which glitch lol there are so many...
---
Yes.
---
Minor stuff but nothing off the top of my head that I can think of. We're getting a "DLC" on the 12th, I believe. 
---
Oh yeah total cuddle bugs
---
This is part of why I hesitated to ask for advice.  There's so much conflicting information and every one is very strong of their opinions.  That and showing my ignorance.  Because let's be real, I am in this bind because of ignorance. I don't know how to plan a build.  Right now, what I do, is charge in and swing All Rise until everything is dead.  And that works!  But only in power armor.  And I feel like I shouldn't even go to Scorched Earth events because I'm a useless body, since I don't have the damage output necessary to help with her at all.  I try to smack her ugly mug when she lands, but I'm probably better used smashing trash mobs or staying home altogether, and I would like to change that.  I'd like to be useful and valuable.
---
Oh wow, no text chat, whatever am I to do? Idk, maybe use the in game voice chat or the Xbox, ps4 or any other chat service on pc. 
---
&gt;So apparently trying to have a discussion with you turned into some crazy outbursts. No reason to discuss it further trying to reason with an unreasonable individual.
---
What are you even talking about? Pointing out that ESO is nothing like fo76, doesn't use any of the same netcode, nor backend, or even the same game engine. ESO was built on and around a monthly subscription based MMO engine. While fo76 s based on the creation engine. It doesn't matter if bethesds themselves don't release private servers, the modding community is already in the process of doing themselves.
---
Also, I am not sure why you keep thinking Bethesda is against private servers. Bethesda has said multiple times that private servers and mods will be part of fo76.
---
I am really unsure where you're getting "outbursts" from unless you think showing you that what you assumed was wrong is deemed " an outburst". If you consider that an outburst then yes please stop this conversation because that is unreasonable.
---
&gt;The reality is your not getting private servers, not now, likely not ever. Good luck to you though out there, try maybe being a little less confrontational in the future for better results with life.
---
They are already in the works, go check the nexus  irc channel and discord. The private server software is already a bit more than half way done by modders.
---
I believe they stated somewhere in their roadmap article they will be adding a function that let's you place items from your stash as decor in your camp when you're in build mode.
---
:( thanks for the info
---
If you're on x box, I make heavy leather armor for free for new players. I can upgrade it to studded and throw on pocketed limbs as well. So if you ever want to grab a set for your friend hit me up.  I normally give out level 20 since its easy to repair but has decent stats. But I can make any level armor up to 40. 
---
flux is just my free 1400 caps for the day
---
Maybe they had a good weekend
---
The better question is would someone be able to steal the displayed items or are they fixed to the C.A.M.P
---
Funny thing is, that all-rise is probably doing more dmg than most people’s guns. You’re definitely useful, don’t short yourself.
---
I never wear power armor and with my melee build I can one hit kill almost everything except large creatures. Those take two or three hits sometimes. Scorchbeats I can kill once they land in a couple dozen hits. 
---
Seen this a few times. Good stuff.
---
Once you're in the game, open your menu (usually found by opening the map first), and find the list of challenges.  FO76 has daily, weekly, and about a gazillion combat, character, etc challenges which you can complete for atoms.
---
Otherwise, explore the map.  Some of the events don't show up on your To Do list until you're near where they spawn.  Keep an eye out for Events too.  It's okay to fail them at first, but once you learn how to do them, they're a nice challenge.
---
Its nice to look at but it isn't filled with as much interesting things as Fallout 4 IMO
---
That's good advice.  I sprint everywhere, just about (and is it just me or does sprinting increase thirst faster?).  I love sprinting. So that could actually work.  Except.  When I'm fighting, I tend to bull into whatever it is and swing until it's dead.  There's little finesse, in other words.  If I'm running it's because I'm trying to get outside their leash zone to recoup or because I'm on my way somewhere else and can't be assed to stop and kill a scorched taking potshots at me with a pipe gun.
---
Western duster? I love it bought it a few days back from atom shop for 400 atoms.
---
You can get loads of yellow cake, crimson, and fluorescent at white springs. You can get plenty of crimson and violet at fissure site prime. Is there anywhere worth nuking you can get cobalt? AFAIK, you can only yield 2 per at whitesprings
---
I also have a gang.  Should we use the various bandanas to make sure we know who belong to what gang?
---
If so, we're taking the Star and Stripes.  We've raided enough Atoms that we can afford to go premium.
---
got laid
---
I'll sell both for 3k
---
Would be amazing if everyone was a roleplayer. Sadly only a fraction is and the vast majority would either not bother or abuse it. For a feature this hard to implement it just would not be worth it.
---
Would you prefer if they couldn't log in anymore? Or they had atomic shop points deducted from their accounts?
---
well if you keep writing like that, ill keep reading:)
---
Don't worry, this won't be the last Fallout game we ever get. I'm sure the next one will take away some great notes from this one. 
---
Did a solo in just under an hour...will do another soon as no one seems to bother anymore!!!
---
Eh. Scorched and scorch-infected creatures will certainly fear your name. The rest not so much.
---
Well, I could certainly get a bicycle to work. 
---
Mine did this, so I installed to the same directory and it just verified the files. Then my hard drive filled up and I only had 15 GB, so it refuses to “install” and verify files. 
---
Now I just run the executable and forego the launcher. Bethesda launcher is garbage and eats too much ram anyways 
---
No, [https://youtu.be/46TgYxgKiys](https://youtu.be/46TgYxgKiys) this, without the hat, the hat is from atom shop
---
I’m also confused about the looting. I’m always encumbered it only have 10 pounds or so to store loot. I only carry the armor I have, a sledgehammer/fire axe and a shot gun. I’ve filtered through all of the tabs and can’t seem to get rid of weight 
---
Yeah, laid off.
---
Any idea where you found that?
---
All the outfits I came across were dirty or weathered
---
[We’re Maud’s Muggers](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Maud%27s_Muggers)
---
I did but then my entire team crashed so we lost the server oh well lol calling it a day 
---
Yes, this is what I want to do.  So how are you doing it?  How many caps do I need to save up to try and buy what legendary weapon/armor to get where you are?  How many levels do I need to grind in white spring to get the needed point swaps and perk cards?
---
I know right, could hardly believe it myself. It almost feels as though Bethesda is trying to foist PvP on us.
---
Gotcha 👍
---
anecdotally, my 15 base, 21 Luck character gets legendary drops from nearly all zero star legendary mobs. rarely do they give higher tier junk, or piles of chems/ammo/grenades. random non-legendary spawns give me random higher tier junk items and random piles of chems/ammo/grenades.  My 5 luck character mostly gets higher tier junk items and piles of chems/ammo/grenades from zero star legendary spawns.
---
The last time I played, I was just sitting in my home camp, crafting. Some guy shows up in my house and begins destroying my walls (surprisingly quickly), and then starts shooting me. Reflexively, I shot back. He then laughed over the mic and said, "You have passive turned on!?", and then started aiming at all my walls and structures in my camp to destroy them.  
---
I logged off, and haven't bothered logging back on.
---
I skimmed the build. Do you have any indication of of damage output with this build?
---
I love my All Rise.  I got it at level 50 something.  It gets broken a lot because it sees a lot of use.  I would like to fully mod it, too, if that's possible, to up its damage even more.  I know it's "just" a quest reward weapon and probably garbage compared to all these epic legendaries everyone has, but it's what I have and I don't make enough caps to buy good legendaries off people.
---
If you're me you are still bugged and cant complete silos. If you're everyone else I hope its everything you hope for!
---
Thanks but the level 40 isn’t of much use to me. How much for just the level 50? 
---
I bet you *don't want trouble*.
---
Some people are trying other new builds, like bloodied or melee or heavy weapons, etc. Many of us also grind for better weapons or armor (got a 2* assassins explosive combat shotgun recently, as well as a anti-armor Gatling plasma)
---
Good aluminium spot as well.
---
This is true as far as my experience goes and it happens all the time whether that area is nuked or not.  Got shot by a couple of 30-40 players yesterday there, but I was herding for them and letting them get shots in before I started playing whack a mole.  One should expect to get shot some when that happens and everything turned out just fine.  I believe an "oops" emote would have been helpful to them, but I never really thought they were provoking me to PVP anyway.  
---
Whole lot of text to say "I can't do what I want, when I want."
---
Welcome to online games.
---
yeah thats not a good idea. i have already some pretty insane idea's thinking about it for two seconds. even player text created is to much. 
---
Yeah, I remember how frustrating it was doing the Order of Mysteries quest at like lv. 20 and having lv 68 ghouls everywhere that could two hit me to death... 
---
I have yet to find a decent weapon from grinding... what do you grind usually to do this?
---
How was the enemy situation?  Were you able to harvest the glowing masses, hardened masses, and high radiation fluids pretty easily as well?
---
Start your own quest. Be a lawman, a chef, a flamer wielding killer, a traveling contractor. Be/do what makes you happy. 
---
I take my workshop of choice, I max out on the vendor cap limit, I look around for a couple legendaries, and finally I liberate caps and junk from other players.
---
Why is this even relevent to being in IT? I'm in IT and this means nothing besides the fact that FO76 still sucks.
---
Whitesprings(nuked), Uranium Fever event, SBQ, RNGesus
---
My perk/special distribution is a mess.  I'm not good at planning builds.  So I will say what I tend to do instead.  I charge in with All Rise and swing until everything is dead.  I don't know what you'd call that "build".  Primitive?  Tiny Super Mutant?  Except  the mutants have more finesse...
---
And I can guarantee that probably isn't coming to the game anytime soon.
---
We could wax on about realism, but the thing is that realism is something that is more of a guideline than a strict set of standards.  In real life, sure, taking water from any old toxic water pool wouldn't yield anything, but in a video game, things are made to be more uniform and convenient.
---
It's evident from crafting anything, that much of the processing is skipped in favor of streamlining and being more convenient than being based in reality.  There's a reason we don't seem to have casings anymore, or specific primers and powders for crafting bullets like you would in New Vegas.  It's instead just lead, steel, and gunpowder.  And gunpowder is made from processing cloth like from pre-war money with acid somehow.  
---
The point I'm just trying to make is that, yeah, it's not always going to be realistic, but you can still take influence from the process in real life so that while it might not be realistic, it's still loosely plausible, or at least appears that way.  If there's a better, more feasible alternative to having something produce salt, by all means, I'm all for something that could be more fitting than toxic water that can be distilled into some wasteland 'sea salt', but just keep in mind that adding something new takes more effort, and is less viable than repurposing something existing within the game.
---
30 minutes plus the caps for fast travelling back and forth is more than I'm willing to spend when I still have to go through the silo itself and have time leftover to do whatever at the nuke zone. I've only ever launched at Fissure Site Prime, so I'd need to have enough time to do Scorched Earth and still wander around collecting flux afterwards.
---
I'd feel differently if there was any sort of reward to figuring out the code yourself, but there's not other than personal satisfaction. I feel more personally satisfied not spending caps on unnecessary fast travel.
---
I have task specific armor. Troubleshooter for silos and AWOL Armaments. Zealots for the Queen, etc. I started with easily had/found one star pieces and slowly added new pieces as I went. Each armor effect adds 15% resistance, so you can get 75% for 5 pieces. If you standstill and shoot, try and to get sentinel. If you sprint and bash, look for cavalier. People tend to dump the one star armor at vendors, so check Whitespring and Watoga. 
---
Oh that one. Lol I thought you meant this one https://youtu.be/tqbDa8JPSpM btw black boy hat can be found at whitesprings where every farm legendaries, there is a skeleton on the wheelchair and on the wheelchair you can get the cowboy hat.
---
There's a rOaD mAp though 
---
I upvoted each of these because it's so useful.
---
Pretty much exactly how that went down. 
---
Farm legendaries because there's always a gun just slightly better then what I'm using, continue tweaking and toying with my build. Help low levels,  farming plans, getting mods for my PA, looking for rare cloths, fighting the Queen... And sometimes I just like wondering around the map, because it's fun.
---
While packrat may be useful when picking up junk... think about it. What's the one thing you always store when you get to a stash? Whats the one thing  you lose if you die? JUNK. I believe those perk points are better spent on other weight reduction perks. Traveling farmacy 3 is much better than pack rat for instance. Especially late game when you have 100 stimpacks so you can spam them in battle. 
---
When this happens, check the magazine, bobblehead, golf outfit etc.spawn points in the clubhouse because whoever was there first might have spawned them again. Its a nice consolation prize!
---
I've been trying ranged more, but I just can't get enough damage out of it with the basic guns at my disposal to kill things fast enough. They wind up getting in my face, or, if I'm where they can't (roof tops, thanks marsupial!), they go hide somewhere and make me take it to them anyway.  It's why I've been doing mostly melee, and 99% of that with All Rise.  I swing the rocket powered hammer until everything is dead. That is my build.
---
Hopefully the next update will address this as a bug or fixed to work as intended. The devs said it should work that way but it clearly hasn’t or felt that way. 
---
You need to get your facts straight - it was Patch 6 that broke the Queen and introduced other bugs.  The game was fine post Patch 5 and the nerfs for TSEs are NOT the problem.  The Queen's broken scaling post Patch 6 is the real issue.  She can still be killed though, but since she's scaling to a full server you literally need a big group of prepared players for Scorched Earth to be successful.
---
yup
---
Server hop Watoga for a bit, sometimes those robots are 3 stars. West Tek also spawns a lot of 3 star mutants.
---
Go through each category of your inventory and sort them by weight (wt).  I hadn't realized that all ammo/cores, plans, recipes, and ore was bogging me down so much!  I used to carry so much different ammo but realized that I wasn't using the guns which use that ammo so I just dropped it.  I typically carry a couple hundred rounds of each of the two guns I carry, a couple fusion cores, and some plasma cores (mainly because I keep forgetting to put them in my stash).  Smelt the ore to reduce the weight and put that in your stash as well.  I also bulk as much of my stuff as possible, keeping only 20 bulked of each item and 100 of everything else (except the black titanium which I have close to 300 of).
---
So... Not running KDE, huh?
---
Good alibi :)
---
Generally people will build what they call Sniper, Commando, Melee, Rifle builds. I wouldn't about ti too much, but I wouldn't ignore it either. As someone suggested, check your cards and just make sure some of them make sense. It doesn't have to be perfect. 
---
Also by the way, you complain is other players killing you or NPC's .. ? Anyway check out  this site, it will help you plan your build and/or even fix your current build over time. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1111111&amp;d=&amp;w=&amp;n=
---
You can send what you think your build should be and ask people to give you advice and send them a link to this site and your build.  For me I am heavy on Strength, Charisma and Luck. I run a non perfect melee build in PA and have no issues taking on most enemies .. but then again I am a PA since FO4, so don't mind it, in fact I feel naked without it ..
---
It's too bad but that was an old wives tale... Nobody uses that anymore, is it offensive now?
---
My recommendation is to get rid of any turrets you got. They are pretty useless and take up a huge chunk of budget. 
---
I’ll pm! Thank you!
---
So for someone who just charges headlong at everything swing a super sledge, cavalier is the armor to go with?  That's what someone else suggested too.  I think I'll look into that.  I could probaly do with flushing all my mutations and starting fresh after saving some caps, too; drop the ones that penalize strength and take the ones that raise strength/resistance.
---
A lot of criticism is basically "*make everything easier*" and it's really getting boring.
---
With green thumb you can get 30 cobalt out of whitesprings, as long as the nuke is placed with the SuperMutant spot at 1:00 on the edge.
---
Bethesda only banned people have had excessive amounts of rare items.. Like over 100k of a single rare item that was obtained in less then 30 days.
---
Thank you! Can I message you?
---
Theres various depending on your weapon loadout. Rifle, Melee, Heavy. Don't recall one for explosives, but the handgun one is basically rubbish.
---
Nukes &amp; Dragons website has a character builder.
---
Make friends!  This is a social game if one lets it be.  I spent half my weekend talking to friends while running the map and discovering new locations.  If you just follow the quest lines, you're not seeing the whole game.  It's a sandbox.  This weekend we made a boxing ring and held boxing matches.  It was hilarious.
---
May I message you?
---
I’ll message you!
---
From your comment I can assume you haven’t watched manyatruenerd essay video. He in no way jumped on a hate bandwagon, and far from it. In fact he spent 2 hours discussing it and providing positives and how to fix it. He has done a good playthrough and this essay was the result. It’s not a hate video at all, it’s a professional critique. You’ll find it linked on this sub, as it’s where i discovered the video.  Watch it, and you’ll understand.
---
I meant like mats to craft 2 stable. But yeah, that sounds like it’s in the ball park between the sap and the silt bean
---
He can be farmed with some luck and server hops, you just need to know where he can spawn as a random event, and go looking for him.
---
It won't take 50 levels, but it might take quite a few server hops.
---
I'm way too ignorant of how the builds work to be a pvp player, so no, I'm really just complaining about getting smeared by npcs.  I mind my own business and stay out of pvp as much as possible.
---
It's a leash issue. 
---
Basically, games like this have "leash" areas for monsters. Once they exit that radius (different for every NPC) they stop following the target, regenerate their health, and return to their starting position. 
---
The SBQ seems to have a leash that begins dead center on the fissure she comes from, and if she leaves that range she returns and restores health. This normally isn't an issue, and only exists to prevent players from pulling her out of the nuke zone. Lately, however, I've noticed she gets stuck outside of whatever this radius is; she flies around, constantly heals, and barely engages in combat. It's def another bug
---
I mean doing anything is better than looking for shaun tbh
---
Oh I thought they were doing it to accounts that had duplicated items on them, must have misunderstood in the hellstorm of this subreddit 😹🤘
---
There's a pretty good amount of crimson at Whitespring too. All the aster turns to red hot blooms. Don't know the exact amount, but with green thumb it's probably enough for 3-4 stable flux.
---
Morgantown is a great location for cobalt...  not sure if there's better.  Though I doubt you'll get 10+.  Don't put the nuke too far north though, most of the flux is in the town itself and south around Mama Dolce's.
---
Well, Watoga never stops surprising me, so i hang around there :)
---
Had ar really fun experience there today, was borde so went over an check a bit around the antique store, on my way back a lv80 SB suddenly appeared close to the city border.
---
It looked a bit strange, so had a close look in the scoope, it had 4 wings and a double set of legs, and sure enough, a few seconds later it actually split in mid air in to 2 lv 80 SB'S.
---
But it still looked strange, a few seconds later it split again, so now i had 3 lv 80's to deal with, lol
---
Never seen this before (lv145), i could have handled them my self, but got some help from another player, was really fun.
---
So after looting them i needed to get my wight down and headed over to Phoenix nice little shop to trade som stuff, just before i could see his shop i was flanked by 5 lv52 gutsy's, got 3 of them and died.
---
Manged to get my droppe's loot, kill the last 2 gutsy's and made it safe over to Mr Phoenix :)
---
on this same run i vitnes 3 different bots transforming from normal to legendary  (glowing green), seen this before, but never 3 on 1 run, lol
---
All in all, another fun day in Watoga :D
---
How did you see 109 players when the server cap is around 24?
---
Grim Sprint seemed hella broke, glad it's not just me.  I notice Clover working ok though.  
---
Regarding needing a gun, I read a bunch of stuff saying that he did need an unfavorited pistol with ammo in your inventory, after noticing him never really doing anything.  I keep a .44 in my inventory for him, and can confirm that I see him do things.  Sometimes I stop and watch him to verify.  I haven't stashed it to see if he stops again, but my messy anecdotal testing says he needs a gun, maybe I'll try later tonight.  
---
The only reason I am effective at my ranged character. Is because I can get the sneak multiplier and target limbs in vats. I have high agility which means I hardly ever get spotted and if I do I can easily hide again. Plus evasive in agility gives you more defence too. If you wanted to go a more soldier-style ranged character I imagine you would want ironclad and other armour perks for defence and some damage and armour penetration perks for whatever weapon you decide to use. Shotguns are very effective. But a full auto rifle can do good damage too, but ammo can quickly become an issue. That build would be very dependent on a good legendary gun and a good combat armour set. 
---
Yesterday, I wanted to make a video essay. But seeing that more people came out to talk about this, I plan on making something more. 
---
I think I mentioned crimson at whitesprings
---
RIGHT!
---
Can I message you?
---
If your nuke crosses the road and gets the train station and power substation, you can get 6 cobalt at Whitesprings, but as long as it gets out to the road I'm getting 4. I do have green thumb on though. 
---
Super belated response and you may have found them already, but I just updated the list for signs and letters. It's a rare listing available at the Watoga shopping plaza vendor. You'll probably have to hop around for them
---
Nope, it's theory for me at the moment, but I'll tell you why I made it.
---
I am running West-Tek about 50 times a day at the moment (with NO luck the last week, thanks for asking, which you didn't, but thanks for listening, I feel better now), and I can already 1-hit the mutant's in there with my Instigating Grok (1*) without any perks in melee skills and a Str of 6.
---
It'll work, believe me :) Just don't go into a nuke zone without a hazmat!
---
Watoga? No nothing to see here, you can just move along *punches non hostile 3 star robot* nothing to see at all... ;)
---
Ive never been able to loot a turrent kill, can anyone confirm you can loot a turret kill if you dont get at least one hot on an enemy?
---
if you can get xp and not be able to loot the dead bodies the turrets kill, i just cant see why people are doing this all the time
---
He must have dropped dead trying to purchase some X-01 calibrated shocks mods. I know I've been jumping servers for several days (weeks?) trying to get them, so I know how he feels! :)
---
Yes. If you sprint around smashing everything, cavalier adds damage resistance. I run a mix since I am shotgun and one hand melee. Three pieces sentinel and two cavalier. Seems to work ok. Those pieces are a tad rarer, but they exist. If play full health, so I don’t need unyielding. Vanguard is another good all around tag is you just want some everyday wear and play high health 
---
Are you on?
---
So, I have a question on this.  I had similar thing happen. I don’t pvp or want to pvp but for some reason I’m standing at a vendor selling and some yahoo just starts chunking away at me.  Well I ignored him but forgot about my electrically charged mutation which I guess initiates my willingness to pvp when it goes off.  So now I’m dead and and had to wait him out so that I don’t lose my junk.  Sucks as the major majority isn’t playing this game to pvp.  
---
What I expect is what they announced before the game launched. They decided to try an help those that did not want to fight and somewhat protect them. But, it doesn't work that way and its hard for both to get along and exist in the same game (Adventure Mode). For what ever reason, stories exist that someone doesn't want to PvP and somehow manages to take to much damage and dies. This problem will not go away when Survival launches, because we'll still have people greifing others in adventure. The only option available is to server hop and that stinks.
---
Oh and I remember 13 now.. 
---
Show all the legendary stats when trading. 
---
Ahh I was wondering because I’m friendly with Watoga so I was curious if you pick a fight or what. I assume once you leave the server and move to a new one you’re friendly again...
---
What platform are you on? -signed definitely not a Appalachian cop
---
Are you on and can you make a level 40 51b torso for me?
---
It would even be cool if you could crit on team mates and double the healing effect.  There used to be crit heals in Camelot but sometimes, that had the side effect of causing mobs to focus healers away from their engaged party member.
---
I'd be pretty happy with a shift from Makeshift into Bloody Mess tbh. I am experienced as a rifleman, and FUCK gun-breakage at the moment.
---
I have all 5 cards of Adrenaline, btw, because I agree it's the most OP skill in the game (with Super Duper, ofc :)). Interesting choice of Lifegiver - I might test that one out.
---
All theory so far, as the little mule who is going to be a new toon one day is only level 18. When she's 60-ish I'll have figured it out :)
---
If I need to load up on steel, I hit Whitespring.  There are a half-dozen places where you can collect coat hangers, and a small stack of shopping baskets.  Unless you need a *lot* of steel all at once, that should help.
---
For lead (and steel), robots at Watoga are fine, but hit up the Charleston firehouse and see if the weight room has been cleaned up yet.  There are probably a few other locations like that with weights, but I haven't had to go searching for them yet, these 2 keep me pretty well supplied.
---
PC. My IGN is Tacocatracecar
---
If the apolcalypse happens in China, Jackie will be first in line.
---
Pissed drunk and with a dishcloth.
---
Yeah, but you have no idea what the scripted actions from the terminals are going to be required in order to spawn enemies/bosses, etc.  It could totally be cool or something as bland as "kill all the enemies".
---
Lvl of gear only makes a small difference in some situations. All though i guess if you wanna know, the hookpole is bugged and gains benefit from multiple sets of perk cards, youll have to figure that one out for yourself. 
---
Farts for sure
---
I more meant people recording their own tapes. This would require a lot of work to implement. I've never really encountered player recorded voice or audio in a mainstream game before. There's a lot underneath that would need to happen.
---
Sounds like your steak's going to have a slightly metallic after taste. 
---
Yes, that's why we should not share it :-)
---
Bethesda has a habit of not giving a shit before they remove ones items. They literally wait untill you have a bunch of one item, then delete the entire stack. Same with ammo.
---
I think the main problem people have isn't necessarily the flux but the number and density of mob spawns... I'm assuming Aaronholt wasn't spawning dozens of glowing ones like Whitespring does or Morgantown (potentially) does
---
Client sends information to the server, and the server redistributes it back out. Sure they would have to figure out how to record audio and stuff but I'm sure its doable
---
Oof 
---
I don’t think not logging in would work because you actually do want the raider aspect. I think like maybe a month long debuff, but only if they get killed for their caps. Or perhaps the higher their bounty, the longer it would be. Just so there was some teeth to it.  High risk, high reward but not so damaging that they wouldn’t play. Or, make turrets much more useful against pvp. Make them stronger so that they are more of a challenge and more protective.
---
Make it a feature of pvp, more interesting for people who don’t want to do it. 
---
Ah that sucks. Gonna have to call the other department to crack down on your gang- I mean candidates to happily join it ;) 
---
Lol yeah I did a search on reddit before I offered... only 2 posts about it... keepin it d/l 👍😏
---
It's another example of how the game is terribly balanced.  
---
When it comes to guns, it's go ballistic or go home (lasers or useless). 
---
You want to do a build that is charisma/ perception focused. but low in strength and luck?  I hope you like being over encumbered and low on supplies all the time. 
---
You wanna do a power armor heavy weapons build for PVP?  Prepare to get wrecked by everyone with a stealth boy and a death claw gauntlet. 
---
Go stealth or go home! 
---
&gt;  Nobody uses that anymore, is it offensive now?
---
No one gives a flying fuck about the expression "Old Wives Tale".  Old expressions die out. 
---
I don't use turrets.
---
Stop in an say hi, narc 
---
Yeah :/ grinded from 230 to 256? at West Tek for all this steel. Imma retrace my steps; i died but i got to my bag with all my junk in it before anyone could grab it
---
Mega oof
---
Did you have "Super Duper" perk equipped?
---
Do you have a source for the devs saying this is how it's supposed to work?
---
I started with a hardened combat shotgun, not even legendary. As for dream shotgun for this build something like either instigating anti armor with VATS accuracy increase, or maybe executioners instead of instigating. Really there are lots of options. The build I linked is pretty much a shotgun/VATS tank hybrid. I do use x01 or armor, this build really can work just fine without legendaries.
---
No I can't I was going to try find one for you. I thought someone else was able to get you one ?
---
You're assuming that the "testing" covers all possible scenarios, server statuses, all consoles, different people, and any/all possible exploits. I'm sorry, but 2 guys shooting each other and reporting it, is still anecdotal information, not "evidence".
---
Eh, there's nothing there but some scorched and a buttload of glowing ghouls.
---
And there's more nuked flora elsewhere. I'm far from even a kitted out player, only 58, not much in the way of perk cards or gear in general. Mostly I'm plodding around in my excavator PA.
---
Be amazingly charming, good sense of humour etc.
---
Being rich helps too (I heard).
---
Apart from that, toy cars, desk fans and typewriters are awesome and everywhere.
---
If you work hard enough, and slip under Bethesda's stupid cheat system, it'll be good!
---
Megasloths-snallygasters-mirelurk kings are all tied together. 
---
I had a mirelurk tamed and when I found a sloth to tame I lost my mirelurk. The same thing happened to my sloth when I came across a snallygaster to tame.
---
ok So what does your strength tree look like, what cards do you have and how many points have you allocated ?
---
Also what armour do you have if you don't use PA, because you going to want some form of armour if not PA
---
Now I understand.  I guess I wish both (perk cards and practice makes perfect) could work, but I guess not.
---
You're always friendly with the robots. The one you attack will fight back, but the other ones will leave you alone.
---
Stealth boy mk3 with secret agent is like 9 minutes of stealth per. He may have still been using stealthboys 
---
Oh I got some questions for you, the sentinel user. Do gamma guns ignore your damage immunity? Do critical hits ignore the damage immunity? I've seen people mention some of these in passing. Are any if these correct?
---
Consider the fact that they take months to consider whether they have enough wiggle room to increase stash sizes... They clearly want to manage server load and storage. User generated voice clips are likely to be both bandwidth and storage intensive, many times more than items already in the game.
---
I'm not trying to be a negative ninny and this would be cool, but I think it's got a very low chance of happening - much like the often requested 'photomode shots as CAMP items' - it's not really practical.
---
What platform because I can help to drop you a bunch of chems,food,and water. I can also help you get through some missions 
---
Yeah a lot of it was very over exaggerated...
---
I did find that turrets and lighting tale up ALOT of budget, so much that i totally removed all my turrets, and was amazed how much more build budget i got
---
I do have it but I assumed it would have only made random duplicates of the pieces I made, let alone 4 pieces craftes in a row  (left &amp; right arm, torso, and helmet) as well as the fact I had the legs crafted a few weeks back. I got a whole second chassis with all the excavator pieces already attached (legs included) 
---
Devil's Backbone?  You might be the reason my camp won't load sometimes ;-)
---
Great spot, until the missile launcher/minigun mutants decide I'm not a good neighbor...
---
Either way, check the shore down from the flagpole, there's a couple items with ballistic fiber that spawn next to the tent on a regular basis.
---
Wouldn't the bot just grab everything?
---
Take your time.
---
carebares and soyboys need purging
---
I ran that quest but not sure I can bear looking like that, I love the rusty grungy default look :)
---
I did pretty far south so the airport did get in, and the cat ladies place was in the zone to get the crops there, but I didn't find much more cobalt, a few around Dolces but that's it.  Did I miss?
---
Holy shit. You just made me realize you can intentionally  “remote detonate” mines by dropping a third. So place two right on top of each other in a choke point, find a good vantage point, and place a third when someone goes through. Boom. 
---
Everything is a trap in the wasteland O\_o
---
For me cover had been broken since the patch before the last where they made it so firing a critical doesn't refill the critical meter. With my luck at 15 my four leaf clover had never worked since then.  W critical saavy two shots to fill my critical meter unless i just spawned into the game.  Grimm clover psyco all broken for me on xbox no matter what i do.  I had read if you don't have a gun in your inventory he will show up and stand there. 
---
Ha! That's in cranberry bog right?
---
I feel like if you can handle two scorchbeast at the sametime, then you can handle a nuke silo.
---
No, sorry. I just remember reading in either patch notes or Inside the Vault. It read something like “CAMP budget is to increase as you level” or something like that. I could also be 100% wrong but I remember something around those lines. 
---
But then again I have noticed an increase. I was never able to add in a fusion generator in my design. No I can and still have tons of space to add turrets and more deco.  I also deleted my blueprints and started from scratch each time I build anew. 
---
Has anyone tested this?  With and without pistol?  With and without ammo?
---
it not changing all the corn, was that a bug, or a miss, or something else?
---
I've seen patches of normal flora inside a white springs nuke before, I guess the game misses sometimes, is that what happened?
---
Thanks, I'll look for it next time I'm there and dump some goodies.
---
Oh shit I'm soooooo sry on my way home now I'll do it now if your available
---
Forgot to mention it. Like everything else. Things that make you go faster don’t stack. It won’t stack with speed demon, gun runner or emergency protocols.
---
:(
---
.... so what we have now???
---
Flatwoods Monsters attack? They've disappear everything time I engage them.
---
Farm mats to buy all the plans in the game. Workshops for missing camp plans. Sbq for flux and all the ultracite plans, experience and some good drops occasionally. Camden for fuzzy tokens daily. Atom farming. Grahm and robot vendor plans. Technical documents in the cache. After that probably hit events looking for the rare whitesprings and bos uniforms. Whitesprings is kind of on the lower level of things imo.
---
This is definitely true. I've deleted all of my turrets though, lights are absolutely eating up most of my budget but they're the most important part of making a C.A.M.P. feel lived-in unfortunately.
---
well yeah.. i know that
---
Vault 76 should be a guantlet that makes you kill 75 other newbies with your bare hands before you can leave!
---
I’m kind of stuck in a loop now at lvl 180. I burn up my ammo hunting for a legendary to drop a a better gun that won’t use up so much ammo. Then scrounge up lead to make more ammo and repeat. 
---
I see a lot more PEBKAC issues than gnomes. 
---
How is that a fix? What happens if someone wants to enjoy a fallout game, not a pvp game? 
---
He was likely handheld through a nuke zone.  Great for his xp/levels, but as documented, it didn’t do his game knowledge any favours.
---
Agree, 100%.  Was killed by someone, no where near a workshop, have passive on.  Doesn't take more than the right circumstances to be killed by the so called "slap damage".  Alot of folks saying it's impossible, just because it hasn't happened to them.  I haven't had a TSE weapon drop for me; doesn't mean it's impossible to get one.
---
Why is there slap damage anyway?  You could still keep the same mechanic without  the slap damage; player hits you, get a notifcation of pvp, accept like a trade request or an option to accept by hitting back, pvp engaged.  Workshops, fine, you take the risk to get the arguably better resource nodes.  
---
Dunno about you, but my armor has the passive ability of higher damage and energy resistances.
---
I must be special. Like a superhero, or just lucky, or something.
---
Damn that is a lot.  Only way I guess is to frequently make ammo, ... and then... the ammo disappears...
---
Its quite spread apart but I think you can get maybe 6-8 stable from the area.  Some are in the town around the university, and the ones south of Dolce's around the warehouse, and by the river.  Some by houses on the SE side of town.
---
Then the story is also flawed. Writers control the story. They should have chosen not to paint themselves into a corner like that. Omitting human NPCs is a simple design failure. There's no in-game excuse that doesn't eventually trace back to a poor development decision.
---
Have you ever played Fallout 76 before? 
---
Heck yeah man, I am with you. Looking for people to join your gang? I'm on PC, WanderingWolf15. If we're ever on together, I'd love to go raiding with you some time.
---
Just a chemistry workbench, and lots of fluids/mass.
---
They are correct. Game guns shred sent/ass. Also keeping the roads on respawning! Criticals usually do a ton of dmg so most people will just get 1 tapped easily.
---
Ahh I bet it’s my ammo then because I’ve gone through everything else. Thanks for your help
---
If you have spare caps, screws sell for about four caps usually on the Market
---
My first civil war corpse took 7 relogs. 
---
My second took 7 relogs. Then 2. Then 7, Then 43. 
---
It's random. Good luck. 
---
Go back and play fortnite .. this is fallout so no
---
ei that is a nice idea 
---
Thanks. 
---
Def needs a balancing. You cant create a pvp server with such lopsided builds. Great for pve but not pvp.
---
I claim Charleston Landfill workshop. It has three junk piles for extractors. While I let those fill up I'll go into any offices, hospitals and grab toys, fans, etc.
---
Yeah, 30 will get you 3 stable.
---
Mothership Zeta 2 would be an awesome addition... There were some cool weapons in the original. I vaguely recall a yellow drill (looking) weapon. Scored nostalgia points for me, XCOM Terror From the Deep is still awesome. 
---
Chemistry Bench, 1 x High Radiation Fluid, 1 x Glowing Mass, 1 x Hardened Mass, 10 x Flux you trying to create
---
PvP is just broke anyways, it’s not even fun.
---
I just had a PvP exp. the other day. 
---
Lvl 163 was hitting me (slap damage) and following me around whitespring. I turned around after 10-11 hits and smacked him over the head with my axe. He dropped. 
---
He took revenge and one hit me.
---
I stopped bothering him, went about my own and bam. He killed me again 
---
Then we ran into each other and I hit him. 
---
PvP really is just whoever gets the first hit in wins. There’s not battle involved. 
---
I guess I just find it boring when everything is just a one hit KO
---
sorry no fights on my cristian fallouyt server
---
If you want a PVP game, go play one of the hundred other games like this one that work that way. PVP in this game sucks too much to be always on.
---
Toy cars are my go to for screws
---
Should I get the “none power armor” perks, such as evasive (adds 1/2/3 points per agility for energy and ballistic Defense) even though I plan to play a power armor type of build incase I’m not in a power armor?
---
Still very helpful! Thank you 
---
Watoga high school and sugar grove. 
---
Its closer to 100 in urban areas, though. You must be talking about a massage parlor add-on
---
Just another attraction. Was it from the ride or the food?
---
Thank you for the confirmation. My critical auto pistol should have no problems then.
---
I’m lvl 150 and never looked into this. I all of a sudden had 100 inert flux. 
---
What’s the timeframe for raw flux to turn inert?
---
I nuked there a while back. Good flux farming. Not a lot of creatures if I recall, so make sure you have a decent stock of Hardened Mass and such to stabilize. 
---
I wish we had more stations to pick from
---
Because I'm an introvert and cranky I'd love an 18+ server option. 
---
If I zone in look at my map and see someone with a high bounty and many Contested work shops I close my door. Otherwise I leave it open, It really depends on the lobby.  My extractors and water are locked at all times. 
---
If you find my pad in the toxic valley and it's open go ahead and use what's available there, I won't talk to you, and am not interested in groups (especially randoms looking for free fast travel), when your done pick up a guitar and play to the setting sun or glowing sea at night.
---
I just launched my first (lvl 63) yesterday. 
---
I ran it solo with melee build (turrets were annoying) 
---
At the end my axe broke on the last of the robots, it was perfect timing cause I was foolish enough to not being a second weapon..
---
It was a blast though! 
---
Bethesda should give you a head start into the nuke zone though. Nothing better then doing all that, getting to whitespring(where I did my first launch) and seeing people have already cleared it all out and now you get to wait for respawns.
---
Let me get first run you savages!!
---
It will never work in a fight, it only heals while outside combat. So if you crouch and it says CAUTION or DANGER, it won't heal. 
---
It looks like what you are asking for is some sort of "full suit buff" kinda like the excavator power armor that, if you have all 5 pieces equipped, grants a +100 carry weight.  
---
So if you have all 5 wood pieces equipped you get +10% sneak or 5 combat armor + 10% DR
---
It would make the min/max grind with legendaries a billion times grindier 
---
If your sniping yes. But only use them if your not in PA
---
Not sure on the exact time frame, it's very similar to flora though. I belive it lasts longer with the perk good with salt in the luck special. 
---
  I get most of what I need from the junk I collect, so not much need to take a public workshops at the moment.  
---
  Given my limited time to play, I dont usually have te time/patience to wait for the processors to do what they do (and I'm overencumbered, so cant fast travel to some other location while I wait)  
---
Thats not to say I haven't taken them, but as a sub level 15 I was badly griefed more than once.   Once when I owned a workshop, (triple teamed, repeatedly killed and chased across the map), and again just walking by one owned by a team (numerous impolite insults, chased, meleed - had a clockwork orange flashback - Fortunately, their weapons glitched which gave me time to server hop.
---
I'm not playing the game for PvP, so that experience was enough.
---
I generally visit PA spawn sites for cores, but if I see Posiedon running and unowned, I'll take it for a few easy cores.  
---
Last time I did, when I was ready to log off, I sent team invites to multiple nearby players and made a general announcement in area chat I was logging off, processor was  producing cores, did anyone want it? 
---
Surprisingly, no takers.
---
Did you skip the part where I mentioned numerous contributing reasons for the negative reception of this game? I described literally seven different reasons for 76 being critically burned and you chose to focus on only two of them, the last two. Which means your first statement is factually untrue and worthless, as I did not 'blame 76 critique' on those two things alone. In fact, I pointed out clickbait writers and the bag incidents as examples of things that 76 had and which Anthem did not have... I did not describe them as the ONLY things that mattered.
---
"yet you completely leave out the thousands and thousands of bugs"
---
Uhh... would you like to reread my reply?
---
"the launch problems of typical Bethesda jank + multiplayer/server jank were just too much for a lot of others". 
---
If 'typical Bethesda jank' doesn't scream numerous bugs to you, I don't know what to say. But your response reads largely argumentative and myopic, and I'm not sure why you even made it. Please take the time to fully read and understand someone's post before you cherry pick and falsely frame that response. ;-)
---
Level 43, don't mind doing some stuff.  Not too powerful but hold my own with a ski sword

I'll be on tonight EST

I appreciate this honesty. At least you didnt dupe to make money like those that sell stuff on eBay. Also bethesdas reaction against duping came to late. So i a blame bethesda aswell for the  lack of taking immediate action against duping. At some point nearly every person i encountered   owned a TSE weapon. The game became so  unbalanced, players got one shotted all the time . There were videos on youtube that showed us how to dupe and it took weeks untill bethesda took action. I believe their first action was the TSE nerf... Thats not stopping the dupers....  And even now i see alot of the same  legendary weapons for sale, so duping seems to be still around. Why do ppl dupe? items? money? Boredom? Idk rly. , for me it would ruin the fun in the game. I like to play the game  like its supposed to be played. Also bethesda calls dupers 'players that exploit the game' but the glitches that dupers made use of  are also part of the game.  So i believe bethesda is also responsable for duping, because they created the code and the glitch. This reminds me of supermarioland 2 on gam eboy ,  you could give yourself 99 lives if you paused the game and pressed a few buttons at the same time, then pressing the arrow up or down to adjust the amount of lives.. is it cheating?  For me not rly because the game was programmed that way. Am i against duping? Yes.  How could this been have prevented?  Release a finished game...  Instead of a beta game.. 
---
Don't get me wrong, i love the game but i think its sad that we are the beginning of march and new content is comming soon but there are still bugs and glitches around that arent fixed since the beginning , duping is still a problem  and i am afraid that this new content will come with alot of new bugs, reddit will get flooded with the 'i am done with this game'. again, And ppl on here will be bitching at each other like its a trump against hilary debate... 
---
Hours (of being logged in) at most - so most or nearly all of what you've got has been inert for a long time now.
---
There is a lot of Cobalt north of the hotel. Just make sure you get the train station in the blast zone and you’ll get a decent haul. Alternatively Morgantown has a good amount from the wild mutfruit plants around there.
---
I like the idea in concept, but it's absolutely gonna get overrun by idiots. We'll be finding holotapes fucking everywhere and most of them will probably be little white boys shouting the N word. 
---
...it was already broken before the patch!
---
It spoils fast but inert flux is still usable.  It counts as water and gives you a disease protection percent.  I keep all of that and ionized-meat on me, they never spoil
---
Well, no, not really. There's no shortage of games out there and you can choose to play something else. The Outer Worlds and Wasteland 3 are both slated for 2019 release so there's that to look forward to. 
---
Cold brew coffee and tea
---
Just note the dmg on the crit shot is a 1 bullet deal. A black powder crit or a .50 cal crit &gt; a pistol crit
---
Grwat, now this will he taken away, nice one op :/
---
I agree we should get something extra for having a complete Set, 
---
I personally would vote for letting my Armor perks continue working while in a hazmat Suit or PA.
---
As it stands now, I sometimes become encumbered when entering my PA due to losing my Deep Pocketing and weight reduction perks.
---
GUYS! LOOK AT THE 2019 AGENDA, MARCH 28th SURVIVAL MODE COMES OUT
---
Fair enough, I'll check him out.  Thanks for the link
---
Everybody here so far are right and its strange in numbers that is the culprit. 
---
And why might I ask do you feel that way about those cards? +50 Damage and Energy resistance is trash? +3 Strength and Endurance not worth it?
---
No probs. I really enjoyed his video. To be honest everything he does is excellent. He’s not your average YouTube chav.
---
If me posting about this gets it nerfed, then that just means it wasn’t fair in the first place, so it’s good I posted about it either way.
---
I can confirm you can kill a person via slap damage. I know ima get hate for this but I do it. It does however take A LONG TIME to kill the individual. 
---
I agree the IP remains too valuable to just let it sit, but a proper Fallout game is still years away at best. 76 may yet be improved but I'd need a lot more detail about what they have planned down the road before I believe that. 
---
and a workshop if you own it.
---
Oh yeah I noticed this, but I thought everybody knew about it, so I didn't wright about this((((
---
I'm not sure. It was the first time I had seen that place nuked, but not even half the corn changed. It didn't look like any of it was going to, and then suddenly five did. Felt buggy, but who knows? Always feels buggy to me when the crimson blooms in Whitesprings mysteriously turn into aster or vice versa. Just stay crimson so when a nuke hits you turn to red hot blooms. Aster turns to aster. 
---
biggest reason I haven't kileld the queen yet.  I'm a bolt action chameleon build.  I would less than useless in a SBQ fight.  thankfully, you don't need to fight the SBQ to face other interesting content.
---
Awesome, I’ve been spending a lot of time in the Ash heap trying to get the D-claw gaunt and Plasma explosives plans...will definitely be killing a few extra bots now tyty
---
Son_of_a_Beezo,  I'll be on in like 2.5 hours
---
Bugger hands, make them use their toes.
---
I absolutely love the music in Fallout 76. What I really don't get is how people can listen to other music while playing it. This game wouldn't be the same without the timbre and feel of the music changing as you wander around from area to area. 
---
Be sure to grab the toy cars in the Morgantown High School gym while you’re getting plastic.  Crazy cat lady house has a toy car as well.

---
Does the condition of the rifle being scrapped, or my level influence anything? I mean, is it worth repairing them before scrapping to bump up my odds?
---
I can't even follow that logic lol
---
Date a Kardashian.
---
You know what! It's time to bring them back! 
---
I'm going to try to start a faction in their name!
---
If this method is OP, it should be nerfed.
---
Be careful. Login and out a few times to check it's still there.
---
I wish the game leaned more towards the ambience of the early games. That dark, cacophonous "music" reminding you that the world is hell.
---
Games that make the most money has microtransactions splattered all over them. 
---
You have just cleared up the question that's been perplexing me since I saw my first one.  I noticed a group of ghouls that I thought were fighting the FM.  As I got closer, they attacked me and were covered with a pinkish haze.  I killed them and went looking for the FM ( didn't know what it was at the time), but it teleported away.  I have since killed 3 more, but they were all solo, no other creatures engaged and I never got hit by its weapon.  I have responded to 2 or 3 queries about this glow and I always wondered if the ghouls were under the influence of the FM, but I thought they had been struck by its energy weapon and the glow was residual.  I saw a player and a group of ghouls glowing pink at the Whitespring another time, but I didn't get the gamertag to ask.  Thanks for clearing that up.
---
Have not been able to find it under 15 for ps4, if you have a link please share
---
Paid the full 60 at release. I didn't have all the problems the youtubers were whining about. The world was really empty back then and not even a bit of lag. Had a fun time doing camden with someone I met there.
---
Outside the vault, remember a bunch of guys standing and waved hi. I think they were hired maybe by bethesda or it was staff to greet new players that day into their game. My experience on pc was actually pretty good. Been playing ever since. Bugs like clipping and models not displaying properly, that's been in all their games. It's kind of expected. The duping, when heard about it was disappointing as someone who likes to farm. Never even thought of cheating, just like the other fallout games. I know some people love to cheat though, can see why it happens. It's not because you disliked the game, let's be real you were struggling and cheated.
---
They did show a canvas bag in the promo. I don't buy collectors anything but can see why you would be irked. We'll see if they fixed some basics in the next patch.
---
We are looking to make changes to Pacifist mode that, when enabled you will not be able to take damage from other players. The plan is for this to also carry over to your C.A.M.P. as well.
---
Enforcer, it's really quite broken and makes every bot and major unit a trivial kill.
---
I don't bother with the weapon specific perks  myself.  Kinda prefer QoL perks instead.
---
If you run whitesprings a few times without gathering flux, and just the other 3 elements you can stash a ton and then do another run purely for flux. This is how I've been doing it and it's great. I had something like 60 of each mass and fluids and then did a run for flux. With super duper I got something like 20 stable and still have a ton of the other 3 ingredients for another run. 
---
Yeah i knew about that but i was surprised to still get one shot. 
---
I’ve seen this exact gnome and had a pic with it lol
---
Charleston capital buildings have a bunch of fans and typewriters which have screws.  
---
gnome.exe has stopped working, please reboot!
---
My dream was to build a camp on top of the bridge over flatwoods. 100% they should completely remove the restrictions, or at least only make it so you can’t build in front of doors to new cells.
---
I solo'd a bunker right around lvl 70 (before the white knight nerf) just to get the achievement (and to annoy some people who had built on my old campsite).  
---
It is do-able, however the nonstop lvl 50 Mr. gutsy's are a pita.
---
You can be very tanky without power armor. I prefer the legendary effects of regular armor so I don't use PA myself. In my opinion, you *have* to go legendary regular armor to truly be the tankiest tank who ever did tank. Some perks and legendary effects to consider:
---
Blocker - negates 45% of melee damage  
---
Dodgy - negates 30% of all damage at the cost of 30 AP  
---
Fireproof - negates 45% of fire and explosion damage  
---
Sentinel armor - negates 15% of all damage while standing still  
---
Cavalier armor - negates 15% of all damage while sprinting  
---
Acrobat armor - negates 50% of falling damage  
---
Enemy specific armor - negates 15% of damage from the listed enemy type  
---
Dense armor mod - negates 50% of damage from explosions  
---
These all stack as well. So I currently have a piece of hunters armor which negates 15% of damage from animals. Animals also mostly have melee attacks. So between my perks, my legendary effects, and my regular armor resistances I take almost no damage from animals. Same goes for ghouls. I take some radiation from them but I can let them hit me in the face and only lose a sliver of health. The only thing that consistently gives me trouble are super mutants with ranged attacks so I'm looking to add a piece of mutant slayer's armor to help with that.
---
Also, scorchbeast sonic attacks are considered explosive damage. So between the dense armor mod and Fireproof, I take no damage from those either.
---
As for your offense, I'd definitely recommend shotguns with the Enforcer perk, then maybe a melee weapon to finish things off after you've crippled them.
---
There really is something really awesome about everyone coming together to launch nukes and handle the nuked areas! The first time I launched a nuke I did it solo, and hit the Grafton Dam. From there, a ton of other players showed up and we all fought hordes of Super Mutant Overlords and kept healing each other when we fell. It was a really cool experience!
---
If you're hoping to remove exploits you should submit them directly to Bethesda rather than sharing them here first. Good luck. 
---
maybe it's just you.
---
I’m a gnome
---
I don’t think this is an exploit.
---
Isn’t the new mode going to have no passive mode? Aren’t you getting what you want?
---
This is what I’m trying to explain...Pacifist Mode has nothing to do with your character taking reduced damage.
---
If you turned Pacifist Mode off, the amount of damage your character takes would be the same as if you had it on.
---
Pacifist Mode prevents YOU from damaging other characters and their CAMPs, nothing else. 
---
They try to tell you they just want to be friends, but no one can hear them over the sound of their screams.
---
I will spend actual money on this to get the atoms. Holy balls.
---
At the very least make it so you can’t build in targetable render distance of mobs. This eliminates the camping st the golf club and other locations. You can still live near your favourite place but not be intrusive 
---
Apparently this dude has never heard of cracker barrel or been anywhere in the south east really.
---
true - I've one-shot a couple of wanted people in the last few days (bored), and that was with just an armor piercing hunting rifle.
---
Well, lots of folks moved to Bloodied builds (primarily for PVE, but some use in PVE too). Still not as much as TSE, and with a big downside, but plenty enough for oneshots if the target isn’t running a heavy damage reduction setup (dodgy, Sentinel+assassins)
---
I just store my junk then bulk, then store the bulk junk. It's never bothered me.
---
That is wrong actually. As long as you keep the trigger pulled, every consecutive shot with a full auto weapon are considered critical hits.
---
You can test this by targeting something with a less than 10% hit chance. Criticals give 100% accuracy bonus, so you will notice your subsequent shots will land every hit despite the accuracy.
---
I am in the process of writing up some testing I did with stacked sneak attacks, headshots, and critical hits on an automatic weapon. The results are pretty gross. My 53 damage pistol is doing over 2,000 damage per second with all stacked bonuses. Nobody going to survive that.
---
Oh, now I feel really dumb, I must RTFI :)
---
I’m down. I’m a mid range marksman. Gt is same as username. 
---
I only mentioned it because you didn't. It's all good though.
---
Fuck outta here, troll.
---
I wish you could go on the roof
---
To me it seems like the game sporadically will work like this.
---
Most often if I'm at say 50% hp it'll use a diluted stimpack, but sometimes it'll pull a regular or a super if I'm really low.
---
for some reason, my 3star beasties always seem to drop 1star leadpipes.
---
I always find myself just stopping and taking photos of the world around me. I really have to hand it to the art team they had a vision on West Virginia and they delivered! 
---
It’s enough. I just recently got my second Unyielding Acrobat leg, really important when I run around at 10-20% health all the time. I can jump off Watoga buildings, monorail towers.. it’s just like power armor. Height doesn’t matter once you have two acrobat pieces. You can dump the perks, too.
---
The Gorge Bridge.
---
Morgantown can be an interesting place to farm if you jump up on the monorail.  Mostly , it's just good for a change of pace.
---
game mechanics: kill me once for the workshop.  
---
griefing: kill me again when I try to come back for my junk bag,   
---
 even if I announce on area chat thats all I'm back for
---
or
---
greifing: kill me take the workshop, and when I respawn, one or more of your group chases me across the map, killing me again and again.
---
Two armor is 100% reduction. I’m amazed you lived with goat legs and 1 piece! 
---
Thanks, hopefully talking about it didn't jinx you.
---
I have fun making weapons and leaving them for lower levels to use. I also include a shitload of ammo to go with em. I usually leave them in the blue suitcase at the train stations.
---
Gosh darn it man you must have and IQ of 200 that is the smartest thing I have heard you are going to be a general someday.
---
Jokes aside that is actually true the mysterious stranger is a human 😂 unless he is a synth 100 years from the future
---
I say go for it! This subreddit and r/fo76FilthyCasuals is an awesome place to find friends to join up with. My first silo I did solo around level 50, so its definitely doable by yourself but also really fun and faster with friends. There are workbenches inside so you have places to stop and repair your items, too.
---
Using discord tonight, so hopefully that works around the issue for me also.
---
You realize this is a game right? What happens in real life is irrelevant, it's just a game and in-game actions are no analogous to doing those same actions in real life.
---
If you are so personally and grievously offended when someone attacks you or your camp that you think they should be debuffed for a month, maybe this game isn't for you? PVP is a core feature, there are plenty of other games out there that are both multiplayer and purely cooperative.
---
I’m down! Melee tank here man! GT same as username 
---
&gt;You cant create a pvp server with such lopsided builds.
---
But they are gonna do just that I think. 
---
Hell's grannies nice
---
This is so awesome!! You can tell how much time and energy you spent crafting this and aligning everything JUST right. I also love that you have a little stage for music together! You should host some meet ups for people to hang out at your CAMP! I've seen a few on twitter recently and it looks like a blast.
---
Sooooo… 
---
I log in, step out into the world as a lowly level 2, and happily head towards town... only to discover that I can't get into town, or reach the buildings I need to reach, because 420MeatSword and his buddies have surrounded the place with walls?
---
That’s pretty much my list, I think I ended up with 5 stable I think, north side of whitesprings I did at least 10. 
---
I will say it was a much calmer event, walking around Morgantown, the ghouls where all still glowing, but not initially in groups but spread out,  so easier to deal with before they swarm. I came out with plenty of the other resources to craft in the future, just not enough flux (I did mostly ignore yellowcake and phosphorescent, which there was a lot of). Also I saw no legendaries at all, was that bad luck or from the event?
---
I tried to start Mama Dolces in order to force things to spawn, but it seemed to bug out, I got 2 enemies total over the entire event, which I won. Is that common or luck?
---
Stealheart spawned glowing ones, but only one at a time, but since they spawn so high level, and he’s so low, a single hit will fail the mission :( 
---
This is the most toxic and backwards sub I've been on. You people are disgusting. Downvoting a legit concern because you all enjoy griefing. No wonder Bethesda can shit on you and you all ask for more.
---
This is, quite possibly, one of the coolest things I've seen in this game.  Inspiring!
---
But you say you can exploit the function in your post, then you told me it should be nerfed. Confusing. 
---
Sure, I hear ya, but thats not how its been since the game released, and they messed it up a couple of patches ago.  
---
Like I said, I was taking a break, and first thing I tried to see if stuff had gotten better, was still not addressed.
---
Looks like he hopped servers.
---
Pvp is a great way of farming caps, especially if you piss off a high level player who thinks he's conan the barbarian, with his "all rise"  hitting air... Get chameleon armor and a decent rifle and he's doomed lol. I farmed over a 1000 caps in 20 minutes. 
---
K.
---
Thank you very much, this response cleared up the confusion I was having as well as gave me a clear direction to go!
---
I wish I could give you more then a single karma for your time and effort man! This post feels a lot more valuable then that to me, maybe one day I will have the extra cash to get golds or plats and give you one, but currently my money’s tight with twins and a house to take care of and provide for.
---
I'm against this. What if someone decides to block all the entrance to watoga vendor and snipe anyone who try to break in? Peoples gonna abuse camping system to hell and break the game
---
I always play games with the ambient music turned off if I can - it annoys the crap out of me after awhile.
---
The main reason Im fine with the damage from my instigating and 1.25shot guns. I just want to play and not have to manage every step I take. Im not that dedicated. If you want to run that build, good on you. I dont have the patience for that. 
---
I'd agree, IF it restricted you to an actual "camp" (sleeping bag, stash box, cooking station)… then yeah, build on rooftops and inside houses. 
---
But if it means full on CAMPS, all you're doing is restricting other people's access to in game content.
---
When in doubt, make an "all-around" build.  And you can specialize in all 3 weapons: pistol, shotgun, and heavy gun.  You need at least 12 points of Strength and at least 9 points of Agility.  Your perk config should be:
---
Under Strength:
---
3 Shotgunner
---
3 Expert Shotgunner
---
3 Master Shotgunner
---
1 Heavy Gunner
---
1 Expert Heavy Gunner
---
1 Master Heavy Gunner
---
Under Agility:
---
3 Gunslinger
---
3 Expert Gunslinger
---
3 Master Gunslinger
---
This will give your shotgun +60% damage, heavy gun +30% damage, and pistol +60% damage.
---
Or you can flip the Strength perks around and give your heavy gun +60% damage and shotgun +30% damage.
---
Add other perks to enhance your weapons as needed.  
---
New River Gorge Bridge, lower level that can only be accessed by zig-zagging on the support structure.

Oh man ahahaha. I'll make sure the Dev team hears about this big stuck boy. In the meantime this picture is hilarious.
---
Count me in, hit me up when you start it up!
---
What timezone? NZ based player so late launches for US players suits me fine. Get same as here.
---
Smart.  I've got a ton of fluids and glowing stashed, but for some reason I'm always light on the hardened masses.
---
Its bad enough I'm done with missions and am doing the same mundane shit every time I play, but to have that same music play over and over again... its annoying.
---
I removed the jukebox from my CAMP because the classical stuff kept clashing (and was sort of depressing) when you listen to it over and over again.  
---
The disconnects happen quite a bit. I think people still duping. Same spiderman helmet as before. Camp loads textures in and you can see inside still. Bad for trap bases.
---
Update patched fixed it.
---
GOOD TO KNOW!
---
Oh. Yeah. Forgot to mention that. I'm in Eastern timezone. But I'm usually pretty free both days, so I'll probably make a poll to see when others are free so that we can find an optimized time.
---
Wouldn't that be the irony of things here?  I mean look at how many places you can go into like Whitesprings where everything seems fine and hunky dory when the rest of the world is "on fire" so to speak (and how the song goes).   Outside - pandemonium and a nuclear blast with radiation and then on the inside, everything is perfect with chipper music to boot. 
---
Also note though that different lights take up different amounts of budget... Street Lights take up more then a hanging light.. a hanging light takes up more then a wall light... custom lighting takes up more then any other light.. Neon Letters take up the most out of all the lights I've seen.. Its kinda crazy how all over the board they are.. and this doesnt just apply to lights.
---
Floors take up the same amount no matter what floor is used. Half /  Quarter or Full floors all take up the same amount of space. Same from roofs, all roof pieces take up the same.. Walls are different though. Full Walls / Half Walls take up the same but the slant walls take up more. Door are also no exception.. basic doors take up a little, but metal doors take up more. 
---
I have probably built 10 or so extremely " or as best I can " realistic houses now with Bathrooms / Kitchens and Bedrooms and everytime my budget appears to be different. I have also never been able to pick up and put back down a house blueprint soo.. its all just kinda fucked lol..
---
I do however enjoy the CAMP aspect and will continue to build.. heres to hoping that in these future updates, they give us more and more budget.
---
yep!
---
No, the starting areas will keep their restrictions.
---
Hopefully that turns off for workshops or group duels otherwise people will just monopolized resources or have an immortal friend run around scouting people out.
---
Yes, it does take the fun away when you cheat. Unfortunately you cant take that back. I would if I could, but then I remember how frustrated I was and it is one of those things that I wouldn't do again, but at that moment it felt right (I do understand that it is wrong regardless of the circumstance) It was as if I was getting back at Bethesda because I felt they had wronged me.
---
This idea helps me a lot! Then I can always just drop a gun if I find that playstyle unfun.
---
Also do you know if vats is very important for a gunslinger? I feel it kind of takes away the fun from the game, kinda puts you in “easy” mode lol.
---
I think it should be more open then what it is, but I disagree with anywhere.
---
The "known bugs and fixes" response topic is long buried since the last patch.  But the issue is they "patched" it a while back so Mods and such would not be consumed when crafting/repairing.
---
In doing so, they made it so Bulk Items would not be consumed automatically.
---
The Hotfix for that issue now caused Bulk Items to be scrapped automatically with Scrap All Junk.
---
They are aware of the issue, but said they have to rethink the way the items are classified to fix it.  It's been like this for a while now.  Since Patch 5 Hotfix I believe.
---
That Known Issues sticky was nice, cause it had responses from Beth and when they planned on implementing the changes.
---
&gt;sleeping bag, stash box, cooking station
---
Second that, there has to be some restriction to filter out morons.
---
I dont know if its server instanced but one run I did I got about 20 high radiation fluids and glowing mass and about 5 hardened mass... but another run it was the opposite. All hardened mass and barely any of the others. It's taken me a while to get equal numbers. I've probably been grinding for ingredients about 2  months now but now that I'm doing the actual flux harvesting its amazingly quick to get a lot. 
---
Um, you can buy them from the vendor "Bubbles" on the second story of the Whitespring Resort.  Also she sells limited quantities of Nuka-Grape, Nuka-Orange, Nuka-Dark, and Nuka-Wild.
---
Also I learned last night that if you nuke the whitespring you make an enemy of all the robots.... learned that the hard way.
---
I think I read somewhere that it isn’t a bug, but it is now working as intended.
---
I could be wrong, but you might be in for a long wait!
---
Still restricts in-game content for low level players, though.
---
I'm out here, hunting for aluminum and screws... and every house in an area is fortified? Nah. 
---
Never experienced that, but I have had some of my excavator pieces that mysteriously change level from 45 to 25, and also had mods suddenly disappear.
---
A couple of weeks ago, I pulled out my excavator PA to hit Uranium Fever so I could carry all that steel, and mid way thru the event, my targeting HUD quit working, I tried quickly Un-equipping &amp; Re-equipping the helmet, to no avail, when I returned to my CAMP I put the Excavator in the PA Stand to repair it thinking it must be near broken or something, but to my surprise the Helmet &amp; Arms were now level 25, and had no mods on them.
---
My original Excavator PA was built as a level 35, and later I rebuilt everything at level 45 adding mods to all including the Helmet &amp; Arms.
---
I get those too lol, dw. But a 3*ghoul going down in 1 bullet and giving a 1* is alot less of a problem than a SBQ taking a 1000 for a 1*.
---
This was my assumption as well.  I'm thinking it will keep you from being potentially vulnerable when you go to the map top launch photomode.
---
Workshop somewhere? If not then damn, that was rough. And he did that for the crap Duffus droppings from a scorchbeast.
---
Yeah lights are big eater. Some say you have to reset the camp to get the budget to match your level. I seriously doubt my alt could build what my main has, but I haven't tried. My main has 2 missle turrents, a heavy laser and shotgun, spotlight turrent and lots of lights. And able to have all the workbenches, water purifiers, electrical and flamers for the trap. I haven't reset in while though so could be missing some budget.
---
You're assuming an awful lot here. What if I know there's a resource location within the walls of this base and so I want to access it and hope that I can take from the extractor? I'm griefing for blowing open the walls to get to it?
---
You've got to realise that this is a video game and that PVP was an intentional feature of it. That means that other players not only can, but are encouraged to be adversarial. Think about it, who are you to tell other players how to have fun? That's the developers job. 
---
What if my idea of fun is to build jumping puzzles with my camp? How would you feel if I told you that you were playing the game wrong and griefing me by not attempting the puzzle that I spent all this time creating?
---
Ain’t that the truth! There were much more important missions and quests to fulfill. Like being the Silver Shroud. ;)
---
Yep me too. Go and get power armor chassis and drop them at the overseers camp, put a core in the loot box. Always dropping ammo there as well 
---
Build dank-ass camps then try to convince people to visit (but they often think it's a trap).
---
Yep.  Taking from one that is still locked that you didn't summon is stealing, and will get you "wanted" status.
---
I believe if it’s your turret that kills the enemy you’re able to loot it but otherwise no.  Maybe if it’s someone on your team you can loot it but I think that may be the only case, but I could be wrong
---
That would be impressive if most of the players in your server decided to fortify each and every house close to new players.
---
Played soccer, mostly.
---
I traded for them. Apparently they have them in the ski lodge pretty often; not at the train station but inside
---
How do you convince people to visit?
---
Not sure but someone said the suspensions would be lifted with the next update. 
---
I don't know?
---
Most, some... no matter which. I can't climb to the top of an observation tower because you decided it's yours?
---
Nah, keep the restrictions... allow every player the same access to content.
---
There's non-trivial loot?
---
Cool.
---
I do.
---
Dude, you just brought up a highly specific example of a resource with an extractor being inside someone's main camp. 
---
I've literally never even heard of anyone doing this. 
---
I have no problem with the scenario you described. Why do you insist on acting like I'm against PvP? If there are resources in a base, sure.
---
If you just want to blow up their base, which is the case 99.99% of the time anyone's base gets randomly attacked, you're an asshole. 
---
I am sorry to hear about the chassis, i lost a full set of T60 right after acquiring it due to a disconnect. I think sometimes we do things out of frustration, and honestly I believe the punishment fits the wrong that I did. I do wish the game had released in a different state, but it didn't. I would like to play in the future but I feel that my account with my real name and info will be marked forever so I am not sure what other consequences that brings.
---
You want to build, there are games that allow you to do just that - Fortnite and Minecraft. Fallout is about adventure and survival. It's about stories and relationships. Building is just something they added for The Sims-lovers.
---
Something like that.
---
I scrap almost all outfits because I don't want them and am too lazy to sell them. I have never learned how to make any. I don't think you can learn how to make them. The outfit tab on the crafting bench is for ATOM shop items.
---
Same thing happened to me, it wouldn't install to the place it was actually in until i cleared out an equal amount of empty space on the same drive, once that was done hitting install turned to play after a few seconds of scanning.
---
Neat idea, but I don't see any possible outcome than 99% of the holotapes being vulgar, excessively loud, or both.
---
Saying 'hey, come take a look at my camp, I promise it's not a trap' has about a 60% success rate.
---
It was easier when I lived near Flatwoods because my camp was in a noticeable location and I'd often find players too new to be wary. 
---
Thanks for the details.  As I read your post, I started remembering reading that previously.
---
I took a break because of the usual.  Had a blast playing but really ready for some solid fixes for the long time issues, and the new issues from previous fixes.... 
---
Maybe just break for a while longer till the new updates come.
---
Thanks again.
---
:)
---
Yes, I agree that the punishment was deserved. I also think that my account with Bethesda has been marked forever so I think the consequences go beyond just Fallout at this point.
---
I quit building my camps in noticeable areas when as a level 10 some jerk busted in destroyed my whole place, murdered me and took my loot. lol. good times. 
---
If you steal from a store you’ll get banned from every chain of the store. Sounds fair.
---
&gt;Sorry, no fights on my Christian fallout server.
---
Fixed it for you, you're welcome, but still **Hell no!**
---
Shaun was so anti climactic. I came in ready to level the place lol
---
I mostly just do the daily challenges. I try to fill my XP bar the night before so that I don't have to play too much. Otherwise, it's a tough grind. I've found a few decent legendaries rushing around, though. 
---
Other than that, I have an addiction to crafting Nuka-Grenades, 5.56mm, Psychobuff and Grape Mentats. Those hobbies keep me busy enough. I can't resist hitting up farming spots if I'm in the vicinity. 
---
Sure would be nice to have some new Atom store content to spend this ever increasing stack of Atoms. It'll happen, I'm just impatient...
---
I read your comment actually, thanks! I don’t agree with how you just boil down the bad user reviews and thousands of bugs to “typical bad Bethesda launches” Sorry but you sound like you’re in denial about the actual state of the game.
---
This game got totally shot down by critics across the board when the full game released post-beta and people saw it for what it was. Sure people were skeptical about certain elements prior to beta / launch but the community as a whole was still giving it a chance. This game crashed and burned on its own, and it had literally nothing to do with Fo4 aside from copied textures. I’ve been down with BGS since Morrowind and if you think that 76 was just “typical Bethesda jank” you are mistaken. Not fair to compare a game that won several awards to a game that is currently the biggest laughingstock of gaming in 2019. Don’t talk to me about 2-3 legacy bugs that carried over, they are vastly different games.
---
Thousands of bugs that make the game unplayable for thousands of players isn’t just “typical Bethesda jank” considering this game is FAR more broken than any Bethesda game has ever been.. There’s literally no comparison. People need to stop passing this narrative that it was “hated before it got a chance” because you are flat wrong. Beyond me how people are stilllllllll somehow finding excuses as to how and why the game is so bad. 
---
If it was offline and single player with NPC's and choices that mattered
---
Feel the hate flow through you.
---
I think the benefits would outweigh the risks, but to appease the snowflakes, it would probably be best to make this a toggable option.
---
Reading through the linked post, nothing in there says that you would have to pay for the lunch boxes. Just that they had the same atx as other atom store items. It was mainly what you are doing now, assuming based on little information. The point is we do not know if they would cost money or not, people just assumed and the post became an echo chamber of people repeating the same assumption over and over again. Once again spreading misinformation about the game. 
---
LOL. BoS Heavy Combat with Dense on the Chest, a passive and 3 Fireproof another passive will make you immune to explosions.
---
Have you seen your toes, mine are all stuck together in a lump :(
---
I'm  down for this weekend if you need another guy.....gt is same as name.
---
Just let me know the time
---
I was just thinking the same thing this weekend. Need more atom store goods. Also I want one of the floor tiles that must have come out last year and I missed.
---
loot is instanced. If he got a shot in on the SB then he had NO reason to kill OP other than to take his junk. Sad. 
---
Yeah people can really suck in this game. 
---
I get that but I mean a few.turrets, work bench and a bed. Just cosmetics rather than a full blown base. Ya dig? No construction. A fire, a bed, stash etc. 
---
Your ignorance is dizzying. Hiring a mod with mod experience. No one able to take that person under their wing and teach them? There aren't people out there that can learn? Xd
---
Im down most days, add me BirdJP19 and let me know its for nukes, if im online ill most likely be down to launch a nuke so just lmk
---
The Mr. Handy bots did all that for us.  We had Atomic age porn.  Plus, it was the future - Fallout 30 was out and it sucked up all of our time.
---
you'd be dissapointed in how many people who qualify  as "best and brightest" lack basic survival skills.
---
&gt; The outfit tab on the crafting bench is for ATOM shop items.
---
You can get a few outfits in-game to craft there. The vault-tec jumpsuit (a reskin of the mechanic jumpsuit) is one of them, and I swear at one point I found the blueprint to craft a vault-tec university suit (might have been something like a vault suit with a labcoat? I can't remember).  
---
I don't know the full list, but there are definitely a few in there.
---
The true definition of this sub summed up with the ones upvoting.
---
It's a grind, but that's what fallout has always been.  I start out at Whitesprings looking for the elusive calibrated shocks for my X-01 armor, run the ghoul gauntlet while there, then sell off what I can, then start on my current farming mission (Royal Jelly that can be used in recipe's, not the junk kind). Pretty rare.  I farm honey beasts at three locations for that.  Then it's the Sugar Bomb run.  When I get 3 (irradiated only), I farm for brain fungus and Mothman eggs to make Brain Bombs with.  Along the way I deal with new players if they need a little help, Raiders and griefers if they want trouble, jump on into a nuked zone if it comes up, events if they are not out of my way.  I try to hit all vendors and look out for any plans I want and might have missed.  I seem to always find something that ends up side tracking me for awhile.   I'll drop a nuke somewhere if I need to farm materials for flux ( I like to  fab my own cores).  I like to roam around in the Mire because  that's where I have found the most diversity in creature spawns.  3 out of 4 Flatwoods Monster, 2 out 5 Mothman encounters have been there. Never been bored as far as I can recall.  Mad or disappointed because of the game mechanics or asshat players but definitely never bored.  I just re read all this: I need a life!
---
Do everything, quit and play something more fun. 
---
The only thing we know is that people who gathered 100,000 rare items in a 30 day period were suspended until the exploit was fixed in "a future patch" no word on when that patch will be.
---
*...upon death you should lose your account and get banned from all Bethesda games for life.*
---
I think turrets and camps need to be reworked to be in a total neutral stance to mobs. Like there’s no reason a dog should randomly start biting a wall, so there’s no reason for a turret to randomly attack it. Until of course you you attack dog 
---
I tried my best, I get better with time. English is a beautiful language, nothing like enjoying a movie, or game in this case, in the language it was written, translations generally fail to communicate little details. I figured I would give the perspective of someone who got banned for doing the wrong thing. I really feel bad the most for having a negative impact on other players, its like betraying your own in a way.
---
A nice change would be if you are in Passive and somehow engage in pvp to have auto swapped off so you can fight back without having to swap mid fight. Seems like a dumb system 
---
plus we wern't the best and brightest that was our parents we were the kids of the people in the vault
---
How on earth is it realistic to process radioactive chemicals at a 3rd world crafting table, lol.
---
Underpants outside your trousers, we know your type ;)
---
&gt; I've literally never even heard of anyone doing this.
---
Are you being sarcastic or serious? Because I've seen this plenty. My point though is that while I *know* there's a resource point behind these camp walls somewhere, I don't know if the extractor is locked or not, or even if there is one built(there probably is). And if I'm getting blasted by turrets while I'm in there I'm going to drop them as well. At this point I've made a decent mess of the place, especially if I've used any explosives.
---
What other players do for fun is their business and not mine, I'm not so pretentious as to try and tell anyone else that they're having *wrong fun*. If someone has fun dismantling my base then power to them, it's trivial and cheap to rebuild, and if it bothers my there's a nice little button that makes them go away **forever**.
---
Read they are going to reinstate accounts after they fix duping.
---
"This mod is mine and you would need to take it from my cold dead hands if you want it!"
---
Random guy:"Fair enough"
---
*gunshots*
---
do you play ps4? i got an itch i need to scratch at your trading post..... muhhahAH
---
When player trading arrives, spots by stations are going to be occupied all the time.
---
Explore mostly, I'm around level 150, 600+ hours, and still have a few undiscovered locations, and events that I have yet to do.
---
I'm always Farming Legendary Gear for Upgrades, I do a lot of trading, and helping lower level players complete their quests.
---
I know a lot of players are doing the Lone Wanderer thing in this game, but if you get a mic, and team up, the social aspects are game changing.
---
Blocker under STR gives 45% less melee damage, and stacks with lone wanderer.
---
Fireproof under END helps with scorchbeasts, their screams are considered explosive damage.
---
I would consider bumping down rifleman perks to 2 star or even 1 star to make room for tank killer and/or glow sight.
---
Also consider some QOL perks like white knight for armor, and weapon artisan/fix it good for repairs.
---
Name it - if you put turrets here I'll kill you 😋 haha
---
Your budget doesn't go up as you level, but the cost of things will drop. The game also doesn't remember how much things you built in the past cost. This has weird side effects.
---
For example:
---
At low level, you build a turret that takes 20% of your budget.  You level up a bunch of times.  Building that same turret will now only cost 15%. Unfortunately, scrapping it now also only refunds 15%.   Scrapping old stuff doesn't give you a full refund; it gives just you enough to rebuild it. This is why it doesn't seem like your budget increased.
---
The reliable fix is to fully scrap (not store) everything and move your camp.  This resets everything, and you can now build more things.
---
I think you underestimate how fast shit would disappear.
---
Quite literally, in today's (real world) North America, due to "just in time" ordering, we have enough food on shelves for about 30 days. That's it.
---
All that other shit? it'd be gone so fast, your head would spin. 
---
You wouldn't find a rifle in a sporting goods store to save your life, 10 days after shit hit the fan.
---
I want fully dense Heavy BOS Combat armor full set buffed so I can jump into fissure prime and kill the mother of all those damn scorchbeasts once and for all, f\*ck that b&amp;tch wherever she is.
---
No turrets
---
You could make special stim syringes a second ammo type and have the medic barrel change the ammo type like prime recievers do on other weapons.
---
2-3 hours chasing a vertibot? Lol no. More like 10 minutes tops
---
Upvoted for balance, I've done similar lots of times and logged off too :( 
---
Isn't that just survival mode?
---
Says that they will look to unblock players in an upcoming update.
---
Doesn't mean next update or the one after that, I think all suspended players will have a 2 to 3 month ban 
---
I had a sniper build but no luck points and my maxed out hunting rifle only did 139 damage with .308 no boosts.
---
name checks out
---
I've never proffered a woman toy cars, desk fans and typewriters before, will try that next time I'm out on the town O\_O
---
Ahh yes I probably should have listed tank killer as a must have as well!  
---
Thanks for the reponse - I will certainly check those out as well!!
---
The assets exist from FO4 already. Surprised they aren't in game already.
---
If you didn't have pacifist enabled, you may have inadvertantly shot him, which made you wanted and gave you a bounty.
---
Yes. It's getting to be a game breaker. Quest item rewards are fine and it seems items which vendor originally had are normal but items other players sold to it are broken zero value and unbuyable.
---
I don’t actually care pvp or not. What I do care is about the game. From your condescending tone, I can tell you think I’m trying to get rid of pvp. I’m not, I’m trying to make the motivations interesting and fit into the game. The debuff doesn’t need to be debilitating, just a bit annoying. Like maybe SB attractant. It would make it a an interesting game choice with worthwhile consequences. How about extra targeting by turrets too. 
---
Ask me, I'm about to dump a load somewhere popular for all comers.
---
IGN icebearhugo61 I'm on PC though.
---
Right . . . and nobody gets stuck in the scenery, or has airdrops land in a "scorch hole," and I have a second Stash box in my CAMP storage just for grins - it really WAS there in my CAMP except invisible and inaccessible all along.  And I've heard there are no griefers in the Fallout 76 world, either . . .
---
Just a PVP griefer then.
---
I said it before need to add a system/terminal that lets you program turrets to set what and who they attack. 
---
It'll just be Fortnight.
---
Just switch servers if someone happens to have completely block off an area vital to your quest? What is the lvl 2 going to lose? Probably better to hop anyways to respawn boxes.
---
If you do a search for Legendary locations on here, you will find there are many, some places are regular, some random to rare, but i keep a list next to me while playing that has 17 locations where legendary enemies spawn, and I have gotten great stuff off of everything from level 25 Mole rats &amp; Ants to level 91 DeathClaws.
---
Epic drops are rare (&lt;1%), only way to get better drops that I have found is to get more.
---
Speaking of... If you are inside Whitespring Resort and someone drops a nuke on it... do you die?
---
I have been one shotted recently while in PA and NOT in pvp mode or area. I absolutely know this : PVP is broke as hell in this game. I don't want any part of it but you know, people will keep killing me because I'm high level and they can. 
---
I've got no problem with PvP outside of not really enjoying it, but for fuck's sake, *calling* it griefing and giving a reward for doing it to people who *don't* want to is really shitty. On every level.
---
Could have been both, but I think it was the Bumper Cars. 
---
I say they should be neutral until you attack mainly to stop afk farms
---
At that point I’d say just move the barrier further out to reduce that to nothing. 
---
I just thought there might be other spots... like the wild corn farm.
---
Yes! I love a good challenge, specially when the reward is worthwhile. 
---
But you’ll get downvoted for this^^^ why??? This is why this community makes me angry lmao.
---
I can’t believe people are seriously on here talking about how they returned a game... because people made negative YouTube reviews about it...? That’s the sole reason? so your friends bought the game... enjoyed it... and then returned it because other strangers on the internet who bought the same game disliked it? LOL 
---
I agree, u/Rekcs, I got around 500 hours in and I was the only person in my friend group that even gave it a chance. I didn’t return the game because people were hating it on the internet? Who the hell lives their life like that?! 
---
Turn it all off and run Spotify. 
---
Why not just not horde everything and anything.
---
Pistols are somewhat weak in this game, so you need all the help you can get for them.  When you have high Agility, you have high AP as well, which helps VATS.
---
Have you tried the fallout market sub? Might have better luck
---
What lvl? Weapons? Build? I been playing since released and I feel like I messed up my build.  
---
And also people that don't have anything to with dupes. My favorite streamer got suspended simply because he's a streamer and people give him stimpacks and ammo and such on air. Beth over corrected and there's lots of people who can't play their main accounts right now  
---
Easy enough to do.  Each workshop can have a zone that surrounds it, and when you enter, you get a warning on screen that you are entering a PVP zone, and you can now take damage.  
---
Ha I popped my cherry😂😂
---
It's like this guy has never seen the looting that occurs in every natural disaster. Imagine that, but there's actually no police force to stand in their way and no one is coming to stop anybody. 
---
Professional in marketing apparently
---
Power Armor.
---
Well thats kinda what i ment. I ment "dupers" as in people who got suspended. Got some downvotes for that little mistake. Lol. Oh well. Whats the point in having upvotes anyways, make me feel good about myself? Lol.
---
 Don't be stealing the Capn's toys now. Those are mine. ;)
---
The Veil of Mysteries does this. 
---
I _believe_ raw flux has a very, very short shelf life of 15-30 minutes. Maybe up to an hour. Slow enough to let you hock it in its non inert form but not so long you have the luxury of waiting to hold onto it until you get enough hardened mass and fluids and what have you to make any significant amout of stable flux.
---
I don't think that's a sufficient reason. I can already make X rated voice chat. 
---
Nah. Paid for the game, get access to the game. That's how it works.
---
Or, create a free-for-all server, all the PvP and hoarding and blocking off areas you can, add all the "just loosen up the restrictions" content you can dream up.
---
...my gut says those servers would be empty, as most players realize it's just not that fun.
---
I hope it's well after the new content starts rolling out. 
---
Make the suspension actually, you know, hurt a bit. It gives people like you what you deserve, and legit players like the rest of us a nice nod of appreciation.
---
A Jester's mask is coming in a few weeks during the fasnacht event
---
If it was invisible and inaccessible its probably because it was broken and you needed to just repair it... I've never gotten stuck where I couldn't get out and if you did y not just fast travel somewhere? Why the fuck would you call in an airdrop near a fissure. That seem highly unlikely but a stupid decision none the less. There are griefers in every game ever. Period. It's relatively easy to ignore them in 76, block, server hop. Done. The fuck out of here with these complaints. There are legitimate complaints to be made about this game. None of these are good.
---
I'm level 145 and enjoy helping new players. I also have lots of junk, chems, food and water to share. Hit me up. GT:  VEGASBRAD
---
Oh nah, I know for a fact I had no bounty, and I definitely didn't shoot him lol if you saw the situation it would be very obvious he just killed me lol. I'm not like salty about it tho, it was funny and interesting
---
I use a bloodied crit damage hunting rifle. With a hardened receiver mod, your base should be 180 something. 
---
With adrelan reaction, bloody mess maxed, rifle perks maxed, tank killer maxed. Covert operative
---
Bloodied and adrelan should boost your damage by 90% at 30% health.
---
Bloody mess gives a 15% 
---
So there you go.
---
Now add an additional critical bonus of
---
Eagle eye 25%, better criticals 40% and weapon leg.perk 50%.
---
Keep in mind;
---
Perforating magazine is 40% AA, and tank killer is 36% AA, so there is another 76% Anti armor resistance
---
And that is how to 1 shot (Nuke) with a hunting rifle.
---
Hmm.  I think I forgot that did prevent diseases.
---
No problem at all man. I just like talking about Fallout, if it helps you enjoy the game more that's a bonus. Good luck out there.
---
I waited until lvl 100 to do it with a friend. 
---
Had farmed a few nuke zones, but had yet to actual launch my own nuke. 
---
It was an alright experience. 
---
It was good to do it with a friend who knew the biocard steps, already. 
---
Hey, if it works it works, right?
---
I thought there was?  Usually don't do it, but can't you open a body like a container if you press (square on the PS4...) and doesn't the Transfer All button show up there?
---
^ this dude gets it.
---
Very few folks know shit about shit anymore. Hell, betcha can't recall 10 phone numbers of friends without your phone in hand. When's the last time you used a map that didn't talk to you?
---
Every sharpen an axe? Ever *swung* an axe? Know how to split wood? 
---
Most folks wouldn't last two days.
---
and even IF the vault was offering survival training... my gut says 95% of people wouldn't show up for it, if they're anything like most real world folks.
---
Please don't pretend that players roleplaying as Raiders was the problem. Anyone who's played a game with open pvp knows how disgusting the ethugs are to others. Everyone warned BGS. Put in FFA pvp and almost no one will buy the game. Put in pvp "protections" and you will gut pvp and the ethugs won't buy the game, and the players who do try to pvp will be disappointed.
---
PvP is poison as long as people can hide their identity behind the internet and suffer no real consequences for treating people horribly.
---
double tap that square for immediate results.  
---
I bought a plan off the market76 subreddit for 1k. I don’t think he knew what he had. First time I’ve seen the plans and I’ve been playing since beta!
---
Fallout players, being hoarders, should understand this better than anyone....
---
No one's gonna say "Oh look 22 back packs and 40 boxes of ammo.....I'll just take what I need so others can have some..."
---
Double tap R on the PC
---
on ps4 its the square button
---
I have both a bloodied and a two-shot Fatman (both found!). The MIRV mod in 76 is “broken” like the MIRV grenades- the submunitions basically don’t spread out at all. Which may be a good thing depending on your POV. 
---
With my Heavy/low health build the bloodied version has a list damage of 5200 when I’m at 10% health. 
---
Mirelurk queen still laughs at it and melts me with acid :-/ 
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
So you basically want Fallout to not be Fallout.
---
I was about to get mad that you were denying my reality for a sec until I read the end of your comment about the patches lol this was back around Christmas time, (didn’t realize it had been patched) not sure if he was stacking but assuming he was considering he was basically god mode. I got 1 shot by slap damage twice in a row, guy was wearing no clothes and using a board. 
---
I am an avid PVPer and really enjoy that aspect of the game but the balance is so off and desperately needs help. It’s already a feature of the game that people deem pointless / disruptive, it’s a shame it is so broken. 
---
It's actually a really good strategy to place a base behind the clubhouse with no turret and just a crafting platform. This way you can just find a map without a base here, place your base, nuke Whitespring, and then your base will prevent turret bases from spawning in for the duration of your gameplay.
---
My guess is that they are working on a better system to track duping. They won't let the suspected dupers back in until they have a system in place to catch and punish them if they stray from the light again.
---
Just a random Wastelands experience.  It adds to the suspense of the game.  Is the next person I encounter going to shoot me?
---
Credit to /uLawlach for the fantastic attitude.  Appalachia needs more of you, sir.
---
I agree, it's annoying as hell.
---
Maybe Post-Apocalyptic America isn’t the right place for people afraid of combat.  
---
Great upcoming changes to Pacifist mode, but I also hope that you add some kind of timer to activate Pacifist mode when flagged for PVP.
---
This way players can't use that button as a "safety blanket" to kill a player (or wreck their CAMP) and escape from the consequences of payback.
---
Oh yeah! Thank you for reminding me
---
PSN tag: soyokaze524
---
I say it every time. This sub doesn’t realize what game they are playing. They are playing a football game while complaining that there is tackling. I’m with you, man. 
---
76 makes me hope that the next Fallout game keeps the concept of Appalachia and makes sure future games have distinguishing regions with unique denizens, creatures, and other features across the world.  I love that each region of Appalachia feels so unique, and just the sheer scale along with detail is staggering.  
---
Most games with an open world like GTA will have detailed worlds, but the player is unable to really interact or find anything interesting in them.  It always feels like there are parts of the world the developers just made for the sake of padding things out, and they didn't have a personal interaction with it.  With 76, it almost always feels like the developers were aware of the playable areas of the game have put things in it that are of interest to players, and other sights to see.  They really accounted well for thorough exploration almost everywhere.
---
Double X on the XB.
---
You'll see the second "take all" option when you open the transfer inventory menu.
---
maybe just the tattered rags tbh, they've got that pauper vibe to them. I hope you're going one handed melee and smacking the shit outta people with the guitar sword and/or death tambo
---
To be fair, we DID try to tell you they were screaming too much. ;-)
---
A new engine? Lol. That thing has ties to Moses. Anyone with hands one ise of the creation/construction kit knows this. Their middleware updated their software. 
---
It’s just funny that I or someone else speaks the truth about it being a pvp game and I get down voted 😂
---
I launched my first nuke yesterday, level 87. Charlie silo.
---
Hardened handmade piercing, x-01 no mods, full rifleman + tank killer + bloody mess.
---
It was actually a lot easier than I thought it would be. My weapon and PA didn't even move out of their increased durability. 
---
Nuke zones are A LOT harder than launching the things.
---
Make sure you have hacker lvl 3, in each area you can turn off targeting restrictions so the roof mounted lasers destroy the robots and then you can disable them.
---
The only thing I noticed though was that the robots do respawn, however, you still don't really need to rush.
---
Now that I think about it though, I might have got  lucky. All the assaultrons were like level 26-30 and most gutsys were lvl 40.
---
Better yet. Just have a passive server option. No enemies. Everyone hugs each other. Blood is replaced by rainbows. Instead of raining nukes onto people, you can rain happy thoughts upon them. 
---
Thanks Mate, that did it. As soon as I spent my points it appeared. 
---
For flux farming, I’m sure there are go to spots. OP was asking for level grind. 
---
Would really appreciate that, I’ll hit you up when he’s reached around lvl 20 if we’ve not found some decent stuff, thanks!
---
I tried having that same argument, but he refused to look at me.  =\\
---
https://i.imgur.com/nwbRWVJ.jpg
---
Though he was caught in a tree, so might have been preoccupied.
---
Go play a different game. Guns and violence may not be right for you. 
---
Fuck you and your 10 friends! I've got two and I know their numbers by heart. Some people just trying to brag they have many friends.
---
Do you remember where the deep pocketed combat armor plan was, specifically?
---
Have you see a plan for combat armor limbs?
---
Supposedlu they used to be sold in grafton. 
---
Slugger, incisor, martial artist, makeshift warrior, and White Knight.  Also I think it's solar powered that adds strength during the day, that's nice for melee.  
---
Tenderizer, nerd rage, bloody mess, slugger 12 and 3.  Off the top of my head.
---
Because that is about the only fun thing to do in the game after a certain point?
---
In the journal entries it only mentions a handful. I'll check Cryptos out and see if there's a member roster. Good idea. Though some of these areas are rather large and sometimes mazelike. It wouldn't be hard to over look some areas and miss a couple. I think there's about 30 of them...
---
One person coming to take my workshop? Ok, 1 on 1, that’s fair. 
---
Four people using Stealth Boys surrounding me in my workshop? Hateful, nasty, toxic, griefing scumbags
---
Does the razorgrain turn to something that gives violet flux, or does it need to be wild non-farm razorgrain?
---
I also play my RPGs the same. Main quest is soooo much sweeter when you are at the highest level. 
---
I seriously can’t fathom the game they *think* they should be playing. It’s life or death. Kill or be killed. They act like school children, “Nuh-uh nuh-uh, I had Pacifist mode on, you can’t hit me, you can’t hit me, I’m telling Todd!”
---
As we've seen too often in games like GTA Online, this will be abused if it's quickly and easily toggleable. I'd strongly suggest making pacifist mode only switchable from the main menu.
---
First off, the ideas the games portrayed sold these games. We all knew they were outdated as we bought them. Im saying this bc im tired of them not fixing these half explored, fully include included "features" so the games dont literally break after so long. Multi saving became a thing bc bethesda games. Why? Bc the games would break for not apparent reason.  Nice mudcrab...sa. Data curPted.  Past visiting most locations, the game becomes wonky. I pray to rnjesus that opening a chest or door doesnt crash my game. I love the ideas, but am tired of these broken dreams.   Ive played a thousand hours in their games too.  
---
What does this even mean? Are you having a stroke?
---
I assume you also stand by thy shall not steal especially other peoples gear :)
---
Found a level 30 torso for you.
---
Last time I played I was proud and felt strong to be level 42. It seems times have changed since I last logged hahaha.
---
I’m happy if the bald fucker shows up fully dressed, let alone has his own pistol.  
---
YOU ARE PLAYING A POST-APOCALYPTIC GAME. Are you that daft? Maybe violent video games aren’t for you. 
---
The parents mysteriously died, were eaten or took off with the overseer (the first chance they could to get away from their offspring)?
---
I swap between Barbarian and Incisor when going in and out of PA (I know u said no PA, but this is for when u have to have PA)  and also swap white knight out for Marathoner
---
Dupers are not legit. When I find a bag on the ground with stuff in it. I will look it. That does not make me a cheater. That is more or less lucky. Or so I thought at the time. We should not have to worry about others breaking the game when we loot stuff.
---
I am on XBox1, i will look for it!
---
There is not much to do, late game was a huge disappointment for me
---
Straight jackets are straight money!!
---
It’s a post-apocalyptic game. Kill or be killed. Form alliances or don’t. Stop being a crybaby. Why even have weapons or enemies if you’re going to bitch about combat?
---
other than the hunter/hunted station for the pvp quest, you arent missing anything but music. no announcer or anything.
---
I have all 3 Slugger perk cards maxed out which greatly increase two handed melee. I use a legendary instigating super sledge which I got for free from a legendary enemy and the All Rise super sledge which you get for completing the quest "Mayor For A Day". I have the ironclad perk card maxed out which greatly increases damage resistance.  I have the barbarian perk card which adds more damage resistance. I have the makeshift warrior perk maxed out which reduces melee weapon deterioration. That's the major ones I use for inflicting damage and reducing damage taken. My armor is all legendary versions of heavy combat armor and I wear shielded forest operative underarmor which adds 3 more points to strength increasing my melee damage even more. 
---
You’re right. Passive mode should not exist. It was a mode put in for the youngsters who are afraid. 
---
And what of people who want to claim worshops but still do the want to pvp
---
Ouch that's a swift kick to the nads 😿 I'll be sure to check on the lvl when I log back on
---
Are you that much of a wuss? 
---
Easy enough to test with a friend. Hit ‘em. If they don’t get a bleed effect, it doesn’t work.
---
I sadly agree
---
Will it also prevent targeting of other players in vats?
---
Sure!
---
You’re missing 
---
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
---
A mind that's a-weak and a back that's strong
---
You load sixteen tons, what do you get
---
There is a magazine that give you +50% scrap from weapons. Pair that with scrapper and some berry mentats. Wait for “path to enlightenment” or another high yield event and then you should clear 2000 a run. I know that’s not 26k but you gotta start somewhere
---
Junk nodes are gold for your camp.
---
My first was under the rail line south of Morgantown Railyard.
---
There is one on the road just east of Garrahan headquarters, south of the hornwright estate.
---
And finally just SE of the Top of the World train station off the highway
---
Lifesaver!
---
This is a great point. I actually saw a LEVEL 45 Somerset Special because the beginner quest was done by a higher level player than the usual 15 level or less. That was a great gun and I would have liked to get a 45 or 50 level version instead of 15 for sure. 
---
Surviving without PA - serendipity 3, blocker 3, barbarian 3, born survivor 1, evasive( only if you wind up with a good chunk of agility), ironclad 5, liefegiver (not essential), suppressor (not essential)
---
Smashing - incisor 3, slugger (at least 1st rank of each card), tenderizer, adrenaline (at least 1), bloody mess
---
QoL - white knight 3, makeshift 5
---
Thought about mutations?
---
No problem, I believe it should be the 19th. Next week is the distillery, the following is fasnacht I believe
---
yeah.. just didnt know if it was worth 5k caps.. this is gonna be a gruesome couple hours im guessing
---
I wpuld be happy with player writen notes thatvwe can stash in random boxes, containers and stuff. Something like darksouls signe system but with no premade msges.
---
"I was here first"
---
           
---
This is false.  You can still one shot players in PvP.  There is a questionable "bug" that can kill a non-PvP player in something like 7 to  13 hits using similar tactics.  Which is a very short time, maybe less than 20 or 30 seconds for non-PvP to react.
---
I was quite proud of my Flatwoods Farmstead, but this has me realising that I need to lift my game big time; inspirational work here tabates1 :)
---
I’m very excited for the distillery update. I shall spread alcohol to all I meet
---
Then by changing how stashes work your fixing the wrong thing.
---
Oh man, it’s constant. If anything it just shows their ignorance more. It’s comical. 
---
Level 220 here. I'll usually do a number of things. If Whitesprings has no one, I'll do a quick run and on a good RNG spawn can get 10-20 legendaries. Then I'll do a couple runs of vendor selling. I'll hit up Watoga and scan for legendary protectrons and hit up the Medical and Civic Center for more chances at legendaries. While doing all of the above, I'll always check events and do them all since I like collecting and still need a bunch of rare apparel that you can get from some of them. Events like Uranium, AWOL, Violent Night, etc are good for legendary drops as are certain locations like West Tek and the Steakhouse. I still haven't acquired the Camden apparel so I'll hit up the daily over there too. If someone drops a nuke during the session, I might join those as well. I also spend a lot of time rearranging my camp or just messing around when my friends are on. Or I'll just wander around and explore since there's still stuff that's new to me or things I've missed. 
---
That's just it this isn't completely abandoned. They didn't get bombed. Their production capabilities would have been fine and in fact probably were ramped up for the war effort. People were still alive and dealing with things up until just shortly before we all left. the vault. It is way to early in the timeline to go so all out Mad Max gear wise(and I do like me some Mad Max). Piecemeal gear makes sense 200 years later, the world should still be filled with current modern gear at this point though.
---
Thing is, I'm someone that's not played since BETA/Release.  So for me, when I started, I only read that to sell junk I must bulk it... I never thought that there would be a whole bunch of junk items that don't need to be bulked to sell... so I was just ignoring junk when it came to selling at vendors as much of it sat in my stash.
---
Now, after storing 150 of each, I have (given they sell for 1/2 caps each) probably around 6000 caps worth of scrap to slowly siphon off as part of my daily vendor-run - or ditch if I get too frustrated. 
---
The Death Tambo is my favorite! I’ll keep an eye out for those tattered rags
---
I know the healing factor one is part of the sneak problem. You only heal when [Hidden], but due to sneak being busted and being in caution or danger even when nothing is around you don’t heal.
---
Classic 
---
this is one of the best games i ever played
---
YOU ARE NOT IN THE GAME. Are you mental? It's a GAME. Are you mad that you can't be an e-thug as easily in 76?
---
Are you going to server hop until you get it? What system are you on?
---
I have started keeping 1-3 star items in prep for the new updates next month in hopes I can actually make a weapon I can use.  I have a 1 star sledgehammer and a 1 star anti robot fire axe.   
---
Minus the last part, I still have my original Daggerfall shirt from 96, my PALM IIIC, Mac SE, Sega Genesis, grandpa's pistol, 44 mag Desert Eagle, rot iron Chandler, flying V guitar from the 80's, suit of platemail, mace and multiple swords. Granted they were all taken care of.
---
I've been having scorched randomly show up all over the map in places I've never seen them or in quantities much greater t han normal. I've never had anything but animals attack my camp but had a couple random scorched hit me yesterday. Then I had some appear out of thin air in Whitespring (main building, not bunker). They literally spawned into the workshop room and hit me before the turrets could even fire up. Then I found a group wandering the area around the gazebo which I've never seen before. I did belly of the best this weekend and had groups of 10+ spawn behind me every 5 minutes. It was insane. It was like I lost the scorched lottery or something. I wonder if Bethesda did something server side to up the scorched spawns because I've definitely noticed more of them in the past week.
---
I’ve got the healing one (you can’t be in combat) and the speed one. Both are working fine for me.
---
Where can you find those mods?
---
Small letter plan let's you get close to this.
---
Fast-traveling counts against the shelf-life too. I think the game adds the walking time it would have been between the two points to ho w fast it spoils. 
---
Watoga Train Station. 
---
I have an extra Sacrificial Blade mod on PS4 if anyone wants it.  Charge you what the game says it’s worth. 
---
You have to be at the center of the nuke to get the achievement. 
---
Yep, if the zone radius covers the disposal site and the tracks to the east it's actually very good for cobalt. Sucks if they drop it to the west, though.
---
Yah this is true but it can be such a pain placing all those letters, and the more letters you use the more budget you use
---
I sang as I read it....😭
---
That’s an awesome idea to keep the turret camps out. I have only run into a turret camp a couple times but it was annoying when they are there. 
---
Im a legendary grind whore. 
---
Anti-Evan.
---
Either that or we should be able to dock power armor at power armor stations 
---
All the previous titles trained me to grab every thing, stick it in a box, count the things in the box. I had a glorious collection of things in boxes by the end of all my games. 76 broke my hoarding habit. 
---
I mean, I still collect things. I still struggle with carry weight. I can't really fight the queen because all my points are currently taken up with weight reduction perks and not damage boosting perks. But, I can still fast travel if I put on my power armor and rad myself up.
---
It's not like I have a problem.
---
It's actually dumb that the stashes don't already work this way. They could just be saved locally on your computer. I mean, you can move your camp almost anywhere anyway. I honestly hardly ever make use of the crafting stuff unless I'm at my Camp anyway. I only needed the stash at stations in the early game and even then it wasn't absolutely necessary.
---
I made some room in my crafting room at my camp for the distillery only to find out about a fermenting station too. I'm probably gonna have to throw an addition on I suppose, bright side is this should allow me to build a permanent PA station as well.
---
Yes, many people didn't give this game a chance because they were not open-minded. However, if they played it and got turned off by the glitches and crashes, you can't really call them close-minded. They gave it a chance and they did not like it.
---
If you burn your hand on a hot stove, its not going to be a pleasant experience. Would you go back and put your hand on the same stove even if many people tell you its not hot anymore? That is the metaphor I'd like to use for a lot of people's experience with FO76. 
---
Your food for thought is like poison for idiots. 
---
You repeated your original mistake and attempted to misrepresent my opinion again, so let me clarify for you: my opinion is that 76 was criticized MORE THAN ANTHEM (context, right bud?) because there were many different variables involved in anti-76 sentiment that did not exist as anti-Anthem sentiment at any point, including people hating on the game. And just because you didn't get exposure to those people doesn't mean they didn't exist-- I read tons of comments on games media and in discords coming from people who hated FO4 and saw FO76 as an even worse version. 
---
You presume that things you don't see don't exist, and that's the presumption of an idiot.
---
Also, here's a protip before I block you for wasting my time:  The Fallout reddit also doesn't allow images, and in no way is that reddit friendly to 76. Plenty of reddits don't want stupid people posting garbage, because mods have limited time. It's not a conspiracy, and it has nothing to do with Fallout-- it has to do with some big subs avoiding spam due to the sheer number of subbers. This is why Filthy Casuals-- the most optimistic/76-friendly sub out there-- DOES allow images. And so does the small settlements sub. Imagine that.
---
Yeah I know and that sucks, this why I got rid off them. :( time to be human again. Being human sucks. Slow and can't jump high... 
---
Thx my friend. Not too familiar with mutations, or I should say, how to get and keep the ones you want. Can you offer any advice on that front? (I’m an older gamer who only gets to play once in a while, so I have a lot to learn about FO76, despite having played in the FO universe for a very long time.)
---
I had pacifist on but when my team mates inadvertantly retaliated I became flaggd. But wasn't aware I was because I as in with ghouls. Then I smack that fool and away we went.
---
I'm 95% sure that razorgrain not planted by a player will turn, yes.
---
I consider Level 45 mid-range, yeah. Between 20 and 60 I would say most casual-ish players are. 
---
For me, it isn't really about the story contents. It's the way it's told. You can make a trip to the grocery store seem like a trip to Mordor in the right words. 
---
Kill bats.
---
Ahaha this is fair!
---
I think the issue with saving them locally to your PC would mean that after some decryption and testing you could alter what is in your Stash.
---
It would just cause another 'duping' issue. 
---
I’m still annoyed that you do the power armor crunch landing vs the feather light freefall legs landing from FO4. It breaks my sprint dagnabbit. 
---
And ... unsub
---
1) in a crisis humans band together and for communities, it is VERY rare for them to attack each other, this is quite well studied
---
2) we all came from the same vault and trained together to bring civilization back the wasteland
---
3) the game NEVER should have had PvP in the first place given the premise of the game and it is likely that it will end up an abandoned feature like PvP ends up in so many other games
---
Well I am everywhere...
---
It's noticeably way off for me since the last patch.  Spotted it right away.
---
I stopped a long time ago because you can only listen to the same songs so many times after 500+ hours.  Given that this is an online game, it would be cool if there was streaming music with an actual announcement or something new that would pop on like a real radio station.
---
Care to list those 17 locations you visit?
---
Yes but besides power armor
---
I dont like pvp and try not to engage just like the op, but i know what im playing. Lol
---
This piece wasn't one 0f them buddy. I would have used it myself. 
---
Also helpful for mutations.
---
*Shrug*
---
I feel like I'd end up using it to troll my friends by healing our enemies, it's bad enough I randomly pick up garbage weapons to use, like last night I started using a Vampire's Ripper in White Springs because it made a funny noise.
---
Artillery is also a fun option. 
---
&gt; I have that perk card on with 13 charisma points and lost all my water in just 15 mins from full thirst bar while I was building. 
---
You have Dysentery. Take a Disease Cure.
---
The C*ckBl*cker
---
The stat boosts give small bonuses, like +5 health and decreased ap drain from sprinting.
---
Yes thank you, I didn't notice it was an unlisted effect. I also found the clean firefighter helmet at whitesprings also doesn't give -2 PER.
---
If you want to be a stealthy riflemen you should take points out of endurance and add them to Agility to get the stealth perks, and maybe Adrenaline if you can afford it. 
---
Did you find anyone to make this for you?
---
I cannot play the game without marsupial.
---
Have you ever done anything fun in Fallout?
---
If you are in the building, no. The only way you die is if you're outside. When in the building, you're in a different in-game world cell (essentially under the map, away from the open environment), so any sort of interior you go to, you are safe from any nuke, as you aren't technically at the location of the explosion, you're away from it, under the map somewhere
---
Maybe they could just insert one radio station working like a workshop players can upgrade it, and play holotapes, and bethesda licensed songs.
---
That’s what I was thinking. I can drop lead belly. And sun kisses would take the rads in day time. And just dial back on my Radaway stash. 
---
Omg, so the people were correct the whole time. Computers do operate on magic. Ill be darned. 
---
I fully understand why they banned people but does anyone else find it ironic they are banning people for cheating when in the past they encouraged the community to make mods for previous games.
---
The power armor station is so you can work on or craft power armor.... 
---
Personally I found  **Wavy Willard's Water Park**  a good place to farm for plastic because there are plastic cups literately everywhere.  You just gotta look. 
---
Do you understand the why behind no NPCs?
---
I wasn't suspended, but now I just get spam email from Bethesda claiming Fallout 76 has 50 new DLCs coming and will stop male pattern baldness.  You don't know how good you have it.
---
... I don’t remember that. I’m gonna have to load up 4 and refresh my memory!
---
Of course im not new to fallout , my point is why the hell is the point of taking up space at yout base to build it when you can just go to the millions of sites that already have the station? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 can you explain that to me ??? And idk if you played any other fallout games but did you ever display suits in 4??????????????
---
I thought it was all 1 station too. Oh well
---
Not sure if there is a typo in that sentence but to answer both versions of the question:
---
Still do the want- You can still pvp, as you are in a pvp enabled zone.
---
Still don't the want- If you enter the pvp zone, you are enabled for pvp. If the workshop is a pvp zone, you will be enabled for pvp. 
---
Perhaps they can create a couple of PVE workshops but limit the amount of time that you can own one for, and after that timer expires put you on a cooldown that if you want to skip to instantly reclaim, puts you in pvp, but if you don't want to pvp, you have to wait for the cooldown to finish before claiming the workshop again to prevent players from just sitting on it with no challenge.

She was still in her zone for sure. She never regained her health it just went down like only one person there was taking her on. 
---
Oh man, is this why my mines keep exploding as soon as I throw them? It seems so obvious now. Duh I wish I could have figured that out on my own 
---
No i do not...... seems like a bullshit excuse to try and go hardcore on pvp/online interactions .....WHICH I CANT BE THE ONLY ONE WHO LITERALLY GETS NO INTERACTIONS ....
---
Yeah. I played 4. You’re thinking of a display. Sorry but I would rather work at my camp on my power armor. Plus what if you live far away from Whitesprings or you’re not even close to somewhere that has a power armor station. Why not just have it at your base. Anyways no one is making you have it at your camp. You decide what’s best for you. 
---
Good games without transactions earn billions
---
The idea is that when you leave Vault 76, everyone is dead. That's why there are no human NPCs. It's literally just you and your fellow Vault 76 Dwellers reclaiming Appalachia. 
---
&gt;Start at the gates, facing the factory. To your right, beyond the trees a bit, should be some cliffs. Go to the cliffs and stay right beside them, keeping them to your left, as you head east. Not due east though.  Keep hugging the rocks as you travel. Eventually, you'll be walking on this rather large and flat outcropping of rock. When you get to the edge, you'll need to jump back down upon the ground. I usually crouch here because you're getting near the spot.  Keep moving forward with the cliffs still to your left and you'll round a slight bend. Now you should be approaching a small hill. There will be two boulders to the left, kind of close to the cliff, and near the top of the rise, on the right, will be a wild carrot flower. The spawn point is on the flat section at the top of this rise.  Sometimes there won't be anything there.  Other times there will be a tank, un-exploded nuke, the albino deathclaw I mentioned, dead trick or treaters, dead civil war re-enactors, crashed satellites, etc.
---
omg You're the best! I found a campsite but I also marked the location so I can keep coming back
---
I'd dress a few up with the ritual outfits around my mothman statue 
---
Sounds like the wise moth man did you see him after the light house event? 
---
I broke 2 of my 4 queen weapons that time. 1,000 rounds-.50 from my anti armor machine gun, 3- fusion cores from my TS Gatling laser, and 800- 5.56 TSE handmade. Very frustrating...
---
I understand , but again even the caps system is useless lol its only like 30 caps to travel most places, also if you balance your camp as far as proximity to vault 76 , most places are cheaper because base , and vault travel are free you know, its just frustrating when they remove elements of the game that i cant imagine , would have been a problem to leave in game you know lol
---
I like this idea. Good idea for something like community fetch quests. Or maybe even buried treasure quests
---
I mean, with all the defend events one could just let anyone claim it again after someone fails to defend it once
---
Okay then don’t have a power armor station at your base. It’s not that hard. 
---
Ehhhh would be better if there were skirmishes to jump into! Like the old days!!
---
Okay, so this post is old but having this very same glitch. The thing is.... I'm far below the 800 stash limit. Any ideas?
---
Iiiiitssss Grafton Dayyyyy!!! 
---
Should have it set up that you can craft different ammo types for the syringer. Favorite them in the pip-boy and switch on the fly. There's a ton of plants and animals out there that we can scavenge from gathering materials for a new set of chem recipes. Having just one syringer with a specific barrel type makes it not as useful to use. 
---
No ish...... the entire point of my post , was asking why they removed it ........
---
Haha I laughed and upvoted -- but you probably just hit too close to home given that they really are recruiting:

---
The decoration complaint might be fixed in april (we dont have any set explination on how it will work or if a camp budget increase will come with it)
---
not liking no npcs is your own problem. I don't mind it and enjoy the stories told to explain why everyone is dead from the raiders blowing up summersville damn to the brotherhood triggering a swarm and couldn't contain it.
---
you have to remember the story is not about this though, it is about you and your survival.
---
So having starched genes level 2 equipped means you cant get or lose mutations.  With the card unequipped, Rads give you mutations (only one per session).  Radaway or showers take them away.
---
Mutations have some crazy bonuses, but all come with a negative.  Class freak level 3 minimizes the negative immensely, leaving a pretty positive overall effect.  There are a few that offer pretty nice resistance boosts (100 energy resistance from 1 mutation alone), but a few damage STR which is unfortunate for your guy.
---
So you essentially have two options if you want to get them by RNG.  You can get a couple mutations or you can get almost all the mutations.  There are easy enough strategies for both.  If you want to go anywhere in between, you need serums.  Your best option for that is probably buying them from the fo76bazaar.  
---
To be honest, im lazy, so I tend to just get them all and equip class freak level 3, which negates a most of the negative effects.   I cant imagine playing without them
---
Finally, dont listen to folks that say sometimes you need PA.  Ive run naked through a nuke zone and lived.
---
&gt; We are looking to make changes to Pacifist mode that, when enabled you will not be able to take damage from other players. The plan is for this to also carry over to your C.A.M.P. as well.
---
Some thoughts to avoid abuse: have pacifist mode be a toggle that's set in your C.A.M.P. with a cooldown on changing the mode at 10 minutes. Setting pacifist mode should relinquish your captured workshops immediately. In a workshop's radius, give players a 10 second warning that they will be flagged for PvP, then flag them for PvP until they turn pacifist mode back on at their C.A.M.P. Initiating a workshop capture should immediately flag for PvP, and make the player hostile to turrets/traps, regardless of if someone is in the 10 second warning period. 
---
This should prevent people from abusing pacifist mode in workshops, and prevent pacifists from having themselves/base attacked. IMO pacifists shouldn't be able to hold workshops, since capturing them is voluntary conflict. 
---
You’re probably right.  And they’ve drug this out past the point of no return for those who wrongfully got the ban hammer—most of those cats are never coming back.  So my guess is bans won’t lift anytime soon.
---
You asked me what’s the point of having one when you can travel and that it takes up space. 
---
I'll sell you one. GT BLUBLZRedeux
---
So happy to hear that, I'm fine with PVP at workshops but I play almost entirely in Pascifist mode and have no interest in PVP unless I decide to go bounty hunting.
---
She can write her novel, stay cool and entertain a child.

Well, this is 76. This isn't Fallout 3 or 4, where humans have had hundreds of years to take back the world. We're just a couple decades later. We're still a looooong way from Shawn being taken in 4. Our NPCs are all bots except Grahm and the Mysterious Stranger.
---
It wasn't meant to be like 3 and 4 and it never will be. 
---
But I won't leave a totally awful taste in your mouth. Go look at the Fallout 76 Roadmap and have a gander at the fall DLC. I think it might...MIGHT have some human NPCs.  Might.
---
Well I mean if he was some how inoculated or developed a resistance to the disease on his own this is completely possible. Are the chances really high? No not at all. 
---
Firefighter helmet is definitely better looking, I'll probably go dig one up for myself lol
---
Also if you want to get specific mutations, you can purchase mutation serums. 
---
You will definitely need Starched Genes Level 2 (so you don't lose the mutations when you get rid of the rads) and Class Freak Level 3 (so you keep the benefits of the mutation and lessen the debuffs).
---
Yep, the duper ban waves are just like mowing the grass periodically, it will regrow each time.  Given how creative people have been at finding item dupes and exploits in even tightly coded single player games, I have no doubt that Bethesda's "code" even presents much of a challenge.  My only hope is that they eventually get so bored of how exploitable everything is that they move on.
---
It puts the lotion on its skin 
---
Damage is way to high. 
---
Defense is far to low. 
---
Well I’m hopping it will be just like that by the end of the year. But only time will tell
---
So, lots of people don’t understand the chameleon mutation. It only works if you have no armor-type things on (I think the hazmat suit might count as armor?) or if you have armor, it’s Weightless legendary. It also only triggers if you have your weapon out. Weird restriction, but there it is.
---
I am in the game though. I’m a character, playing the game, and you can run into me in the game. Sounds like I’m in the game. Are you mad you can that you can’t just hug every person you run across. Might as well remove every enemy. You clearly don’t like violence or weapons. 
---
He has really light blonde hair but looks bald when his hat gets lazy :)
---
The game says you are over encumbered when you leave/join some times, when you are not actually.   I think it has to do with weight reduction perks and armor mods like deep pocketed.  For a moment while the game is loading things those are not counted or something like that.  
---
Oh that explains it. I guess it's related to the cool down on crafting spam. 
---
Well yeah I know.
---
I've run two solos, roughly an hour or so, but I was around a lvl 55 at the time. I've been running a good two handed melee build. Can do roughly 250 raw damage with all rise. Using slugger all maxed, and incisor to ignore 75% armor.
---
You know what’s weird, back in December when I would join a friend, I wouldn’t be overencumbered anymore.. I’m on ps4 btw. Idk if that makes any difference
---
Yes! Lots of glowing mongrels, bloatflys, bloodbugs, and mole rats. 
---
This is such a thorough answer, beyond what I expected even, so thank you for being such a kind and selfless person! Hope to see you in Appalachia!
---
I love the map but agree it could use a higher density of enemies. Also, why can't we pick the yellow luminescent mushrooms in the Mire?
---
No it doesn’t. But it does spawn a decent amount of glowing mongrels, mole rats, and bugs. I collected quite a few materials through it
---
Even if you weren't switching stats, I'd rate Sneak &amp; Escape Artist higher than Covert Ops. Ability to get back into stealth and stay there is more useful than the damage bonus.
---
Bloody Mess is far stronger than the +5% rifle-specific perks because it's multiplicative. Almost any build should have it. I'd drop Quick Hands there. If you like fast reloads then get Speed Demon.
---
Adrenaline's good for a point at least. I wouldn't bother with Long Shot, as the rifles seem plenty accurate enough for long-range headshots unless you use two-shot legendaries.
---
I'm ambivalent on Tormentor but it's probably good against Scorchbeasts. Weapon Artisan should be a swap-in, although that might be a pain if you're using laser rifles.
---
You have speed demon?
---
Yessir! 
---
They ran out of dev time because Bethesda was breathing down their necks, I wonder why Bethesda releases are always such a buggy mess... it's almost as if they rush their products.
---
Oh.  So even though he was killed by it, he probably didn’t get it cause we were on the very outside of the death radius?
---
It’s something like a Vault Tec University track suit or something. Sorta looks like a sweat suit
---
Yeah i get that when just starting solo or joining through the social menu. But that only last a few seconds. What i'm talking about is permanent for the session. Like i said, i can fast travel but not run. Inventory and map shows two different weights as well, both not even close to what i should have.
---
Maybe theres a Hunter/Hunted bug in the game that was never spotted because its the first time this event was triggered?
---
And that wonderful map is HUGE
---
Yeah i can start solo and join through social and everything is fine.
---
A level 1 anti armor? You wanna sell that to me?
---
If i had a nickel for every person i was in the military with that i had to explain that they needed to stay hydrated, wash their clothes weekly, and shower regularly I probably could've bought myself a car. 
---
The fix is so simple: just make the shots not damage the player at all, instead of a little bit of damage per shot.
---
HELL NO.  Anything stored locally on a person's PC has potential to exploit and cheat.
---
This is also such a thorough answer, beyond what I expected even, so thank you for being such a kind and selfless person! Hope to see you in Appalachia!
---
The dupers made a broken game palatable. 
---
Yeah, that sucks. I've done that a few times, and for now on I VATS anything near those stupid robots.
---
yeah was damn near one shoting without it with a useless amount of bullets in a clip. now my dmg is where i want it to be and i am comfortable with the clip size.
---
I was at the edge of a nuke zone too, in the BOS camp just north of the Fissure Prime.  I must have stepped a bit too close because I had the joy of watching myself become an ash pile.  Worth the laugh though!
---
No just well organized raiders.  Did a raider ever 1v1 you in any other game? 
---
Looks a lot like mine. I kept my intelligence at 5, though. Make the weapon, fire it a couple times, then swap for weapon artisan and repair. Frees up three points to use in luck or perception.
---
I listened to the pop boy radio until all the songs got old. Now I crank up my turntable and make my own soundtrack.  
---
I found a bobble head in a similar busted monitor just like that 
---
My main uses full auto weapons. They are quite effective in actual fights. Snipers are still the hardest to deal with tho
---
You can start a new character and call it new game+
---
That's like telling a kid to play on the slide when he complains that the swings are broken. Yes, I can change my play-style, and I have actually, but that is not as fun as playing the game in the way that I would like to play it.
---
Since the 2/19 patch, the only thing they offers is attacks by other players.  They are useless in providing resources and are just PVP zones.
---
I got a lot of cobalt flux nuking the lake in the toxic valley. All the bloodleaf yields cobalt flux.
---
I had it wrong with it. I looked it up in my game afterwards. It's called 'Vault-Tec University Jumpsuit' and it's an undersuit; the ones that you put underneath armor and can upgrade to have +5 resistance in Physical/Energy/Radiation (along with special stat boosts). 
---
The vault-tec jumpsuit is definitely there though, and that's a craftable outfit.
---
I’d use speed demon but I have really bad luck with mutations. Even with starched at max I seem to lose them. So yeah. Also I use a lever so ammo and reloads are a must. Only reason I use quick hands. 
---
I’m thinking of dropping suppressor and putting the points for bloody and dropping lead belly for more agility. 
---
Tormentor is good for me when faced with the big game mobs. Mirelurk queen SB and the tankier mobs. 
---
How often do y’all have to restart y’all a computers?
---
Workshops are PvP content. Deal with the possibility that someone might attack you.
---
I got some Camp plans such as warehouse and assorted lights earlier at George's Junkyard. Didn't know if better plans could be obtained from "higher level" areas
---
My best buddy SB likes to hang out and play a few rounds on the greens.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/Lmopixi.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Lmopixi.jpg)
---
That usually happens if you were previously over budget, sometimes when moving camps itll duplicate items, so if you were over budget after that, once you delete items you wont get the space back, happened to me once
---
Around Clarksburg, up in the toxic valley, there is a decent amount of bloodleaf/Cobalt in all the puddles of water.  it's at least my 'go-to' when it comes to cobalt flux.
---
So your saying i bought a 60 dollar game ...... that is about "reading stories" and fighting honey bees ???? 😂😂🤣😂 hmmm if i want to read ? I will grab a book thanks......
---
Hunting rifle was not dropping in a legendary form for a long time due to a bug. Duping has been mostly eliminated before they fixed that bug, which is what implies relative rarity of TSE Hunting Rifle - it probably was not duped. The price this person demanded was not based on its damage output, it was based on demand between collectioners.
---
Exactly. All items must be monitored by the server.
---
Unfortunately I was not and am very aware of that glitch.
---
Quite literally had room to spare.
---
I was planning on keep it at 6. Which gives me the option to repair and over repair PA if need be. And access to the science perks maxed. 
---
MAGA! (make appalachia great again)
---
nice that adds one more to my list 
---
I have had this issue as well. Ps4
---
It was level 25 and base durability was really low. I get the price but if it would be the only one in existence I could see the price that high but it’s not. 
---
&gt; It took 48 hits on him
---
48x5=240
---
That's about right for someone who probably has 1 END for 255 max HP and a little bit of damage or radiation.
---
There is no reason for this particular meta as you can achieve sufficient damage output to down full bloodbuilds, full sentinels/cavaliers and hybrids between these.
---
I've got a ton of different pieces if you want to check them out. Lots of two stars. 
---
&gt; Some thoughts to avoid abuse: have pacifist mode be a toggle that's set in your C.A.M.P.
---
I agree that some prevention of abuse is required but this would be very frustrating. I like to enable pacifist to enter nuked Whitesprings or battle the SBQ, it would be a huge inconvenience to have to do this at my CAMP.
---
Yarp. Speaking from experience.....
---
It'll work on your own turrets at your CAMP, too! 
---
I use a bloody handmade for queens at a distance with sneak damage and pray it doesn't see me. 
---
Just go for it solo it’s a lot easier
---
If theres someone in need im there 4 them
---
You're like everyone who gets a manual for whatever and then doesn't  RTFM and wonders why they have issues.
---
Simple. It's been out long enough. Do your research, is this game doing what i want,  if yes,  cool buy it. No. Then don't go complaining because you were too daft to look into it...
---
Frankly there was plenty info available during the beta....
---
I don't know there's plenty of ways to obtain plans besides workshops. I advise staying the hell away from workshops and avoiding them at all costs.
---
I see you're still being a creepy little stalker bitch. 
---
so you didn't buy the game? afterall, the no npcs thing was known well before launch.
---
go troll somewhere else.
---
Speak for yourself, I'm 38. Child prodigy. I was 13 going in. 
---
Wtf are you talking about??????????????
---
Read the manual for what you freak??????
---
To understand what my video game is about!!!????!!!!!
---
That's what I said.
---
I'll pass it along to the dev team
---
We didn't do much of anything. We probably had less conscious vault time than nate and Nora before we got knocked out and plugged into the matrix. It's a simulation.
---
If not that, then probably video games lol they had some pretty sweet vr worlds that could keep you alive hundreds of years and inside the vr world you get to play red menace all day
---
thought i was the only one. been playing since beta and still try to harvest them, lol.
---
Yea, he had next to no armour on too, or atleast looked like it
---
Not to mention i have had the game and all the other fallouts, so you can pump your brakes buddy boy
---
If you haven't already, please submit a ticket along with your Launcher logs (found in the [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) Launcher folder in Logs wherever you saved your Launcher install) with our Support group so they can best help troubleshoot. [https://help.bethesda.net](https://help.bethesda.net)

Something to try (again, if you haven't already), would be to run the Launcher Repair Tool. Our Support article here provides instructions if you need them: [https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a\_id/42654](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/42654)
---
Feel free to reach out if you need if you have any questions. 
---
None of this is coming to the game any time soon. Or, likely, ever, without mod support. 
---
Doesn't change the fact that I'd rather things be more reasonable, more close to reality, than not. 
---
Frankly, I'd love to see substitutions. I'd love to be able to use purified water in recipes, as an example. The idea that salt magically adds some form of improvement to something to make it have more of a positive affect always struck me as nutty anyway. 
---
But we won't ever have a world where pepper plants are a viable option in north america. Unless it's in a specialty greenhouse situation. 
---
Great. With this Idea, I can play TF2 while in Fallout 76. All I need now is my teammates yelling "MEDIC!" every 5 seconds and it'll be perfect. 
---
Not to mention its a forum for what ever i want ..... why would you put your worthless 2 cents in if i didnt ask you directly .... cheesewheelmare......
---
You might want to try the treasure maps. The Toxic Valley ones are relatively easy to find, and they can roll BoS plans. Probably a very low chance, but I've never seen a BoS plan as a world spawn.
---
And frankly if you dont have anything constructive to say then KEEP IT TO YOURSELF ......... 😍
---
Yep.
---
Legendary effects need to not be a thing in PvP servers. Same thing with stealth boys, criticals, and VATS. 
---
I know that’s removing some of the main cores of Fallout combat, but it’s legitimately the only way to do PvP without it devolving into a 1hit gankfest to see who can come up with the most broken, cheese build. 
---
Nope just really far north east
---
When did i day that?
---
I love finding skeletons in garbage cans. First one I noticed kind of creeped me out. 
---
It doesn't matter, slap damage = 5.
---
Buddy can you please copy and paste the part where i say "I DIDNT BUY THE GAME" ...... let me kjow i will wait... and trolling .... asshole you commented on my thread 😂🤣🤣😂😂😂
---
Case and point
---
You did no research on the type of game  the game play, how any of it works. 
---
Bought the game and low and behold, it doesn't do what you want. 
---
Plenty info out there on what the game style is, what goes on etc. Etc. Etc. 
---
And dear lord. 
---
I was comparing you to someone who buys something and doesn't read the manual and then complains it doesn't work. 
---
You bought the game and complain because You didn't do your research into its play style. 
---
My base only has two turrets, dood. I'm in the business of impressing the neighbors with my sweet house and keeping property value high.
---
I like the way you think. I haven't seen a complete source, but these may be of some use:

---
I think that’s more the server vs who you’re with. Some people (myself included) believe that each time you log in, there are a few legendary affixes that are tagged to the world as the “more common” ones. Hence why you will get a lot of Hunter and Assassin in one sitting, etc. 
---
Sounds like you may have had an explosive affix server on that occasion.
---
Can they not just turn slap dam off all together?
---
*watches you throw your toys out of the pram*
---
You're amusing btw
---
ah, you are right. i misread that as "you bought" for some reason. sorry about that.
---
I have picked up different plans from different workshops.
---
I think each one has a set group as I only get known plans from the ammo factory now but got a couple of unknown ones from hemlock holes
---
If the game mechanics were fully realized as they should be, inventory management and having limited space and having to make difficult choices to make in what to pick up. It would make for a good mechanic, it's not a matter of your play style it's a matter of it's not meant to be played like that. But past games and the current game not making those hard decisions make the entire thing not work.
---
Now, whether or not the mechanic of having to make those hard decisions would be fun in an ideal game is a diffrent conversation.
---
I always love dealing with the ID10Ts over the phone or in person. When they would ask me what the problem was, I would tell them it is an id10t problem. When they asked what that was, I would tell them to write it down. 
---
which enemies spawn at this location?
---
Lol is ambushing a new internet term ? 😂🤣🤣😂
---
And no prams here buddy , in america we ride trains
---
Fallout 1, 2, 3, 4 are nothing like 76
---
A well known fact!
---
A fact known about for months.
---
Agreed. If only the FM would appear around other enemies more often...
---
Just make it that when you're about to take a workshop there's a notification that your pacifist mode will be toggled OFF until you log off or lose the workshop to someone else.
---
I have to wonder what you consider IT then if you do not get this. 
---
I found this particular example of you being a whiny twat on my home feed.
---
Drackar39: “Don’t shoot at me, it will ruin my fun!”
---
Funny enough, I don't play the game for PvP, and having it be entirely optional without limiting what I can do ingame would be nice.
---
Lmao sorry i had a rough work day 😂🤣🤣😂 and all i want is a shoot out with some raiders to feel better not honey bees 😂
---
Dang. Should have searched everywhere. Hindsight 
---
Yup. I really wish they'd been given the watoga treatment. 
---
Lol I like it and wanted to try venturing outside for once without power armor so it's perfect
---
Most people only started dupen after they ran out of stuff to do, let’s not pretend it was some horrible crime.
---
Just people entertaining themselves in a broke game.
---
Perception - increases vats accuracy, and allows you to see enemies a little bit farther away on your compass if they are aggro
---
Endurance - increases max HP and decreases sprinting AP drain, also makes you a little bit more resistant to disease 
---
Charisma - increases rewards from events
---
Intelligence - boosts the amount of EXP earned for everything a little bit and allows crafted items to have better durability
---
Agility - boosts your AP and slightly decreases vats AP cost
---
Luck - in game helps you fill your vats cit meter a bit faster, also increases the durability of found gear. good if you wanna try to go for better legendary durability when farming for those
---
stash all your junk..especially ballistic fiber
---
Well doesn't help when they ban a chunk of players either
---
Cant do it if I can't get to a stash box.
---
I mean, yeah, I don't want to deal with PVP bullshit. Nor does the vast majority of their player base. 
---
You being an asshat about it doesn't change that reality. 
---
They should put some area where people can ONLY toggle pacifist mode on/off, for example in train station, red rocket gas station or your CAMP.
---
r/Market76
---
r/fo76bazaar
---
Because people like you need a bit off common sense.
---
Judging by the down voting on your posts i feel my points are well justified
---
Either way its irreverent, i was asking a question, and you were a little less than hospital lmao sorry also i had a bad day at work , and shooting some raiders would help out ALOTTT
---
Yes, you can lock it cause it has a door.
---
no turrets at WS
---
We took a team pic of the same. Need more 'NPC' like this and graham!!

Well, I have turrets and I live out on the golf course. I appreciate you trying to jump into the comments to try  and prove me wrong. Keep being such a fun person!;)
---
The 19th Hole. Sell drinks with the new brewing system coming.
---
Seriously..... common sense .....about what?? a video game  
---
? But your information was sent to the devs...
---
You mean hospitable im assuming. 
---
A bad day at work?
---
After a bad day i strongly advise avoiding suicidal media and reddit.
---
I'm pretty sure there's a dead deathclaw merchant and pack near the fissure prime when it's nuked...
---
A few quests get started that way, Sons of Dane event, as an example. But the main radio station? Nope. 
---
Buying a video game that's not even close to what you were expecting when there was plenty of information telling you the things you Expected weren't in the game
---
Is that another term i would know if i didn't have a job?
---
Who told you all that?

Suicidal media.  Good god that's a good way to talk about social media. I'm not gonna correct that one
---
no &amp; no
---
I had this happen post nuke and have saved all of them for vending to players specifically (PS4) . I’ll log on and post them later if anyone is interested. I know I’ve got 4 lvl 1 pieces of bolstering. You can throw them on fresh out of the vault and have 12 SPECIAL stats across the board :D  (expect END). 
---
i am lvl 126 and still have set to launch a nuke. i tried solo before your lvl and after but both times had server crashes mid way thu and got too fustrated. now i must say the stability issue is nearly resoloved and its safe to make your attempt.  and thank you bethesda for listening and making progress
---
Because from What you can go back and actually do your self a favor and  read .... never once did i say 1,  i was unhappy, 2 didn't know what i bought, 3 hated it lol also don't feel to smart buddy , cellphones have auto correct lol its called a typo lol
---
No, I've never been able to loot my own turret's kills.  Doesn't seem right.
---
No displays of your items,  power armour - you
---
No human npc , it's lonely - you
---
All facts known about the game
---
Your armor unequips when you get in the power armor
---
Yep. (So much Troubleshooter lmao.)
---
Here’s a thread about it. [link!](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag3ovu/an_observation_from_a_die_hard_legendary_farmer/) 
---
good chance it could be like that by the end of the "Wild Appalachia" content cycle, if the content is strong enough. (player vendors and backpacks ahoy!)
---
Ok...
---
 Now tell me again mr. Cheesy .... where that says im not happy with my game .... just complaining about a thing or two..... geez you sir should be a reporter or detective lol
---
I love the Scorchbeasts

Ah...so that’s the “hook” to keep people out of power armor.  There’s some great perks out there.  I bought a discarded piece of arm armor today from a robot vendor that decreases weapon weight by 20% (I presume it applies to all weapons on your avatar).  I thought to myself “you’d be crazy to give this one up”.
---
I just got a stalkers hatchet last night!
---
They say they did, but it seems a lot of people were caught up in it even if they just picked up a bag of ammo that someone else left.
---
See posts above. 
---
You can't reply to an existing chain i see.
---
I never said you hated it. I stated you are complaining about features that don't exist
---
I have a solution...
---
I’ve been killed by players numerous times in this game.  It’s part of the game.  If you don’t like it, adapt your style so you are less at risk.  Perhaps you might grow a little as a person, too!
---
Really, Drackar, you were the d-bag in the conversation with u/Lausee 
---
This is an extremely annoying bug for sure. Until it's fixed, what I do is drop my bulked items (always doing one alone first to make sure the bag spawns) and then I scrap all junk. Sometimes I forget though and end up rescrapping my bulked items.
---
Kiss your mother with that mouth?
---
Will your play with me ? Be my online partner ? 😁
---
Yup. Good old’ ID ten T errors. 
---
Low level godroll weapons have higher price tag too. Im now hunting for a set of godarmor for levels 20-30 and its harder than for 45-50.
---
Yeah, I have the same problem with my two lever rifles on PC. I can work around it by setting the favorites again after loading. Looks like it doesn't store enough information when saving to distinguish between the weapons.
---
Yeah that’s not right. They should make it so you’re able to loot it
---
We can be battle buddies ........ o0o or even better like super mario brothers!! 
---
And i bet you're not on the same platform as myself
---
Are you calling me poor 
---
Its a cool map and all, but we don't 'have to enjoy it' as you say, I love the cranberry bog but the forest shouldnt even exist and im not going to tell people who also see that as a we bit silly too 'ohwell you HAVE to enjoy it' as it comes across a little intense.
---
No im just waiting to see what platform you play on
---
You’ve been gnomed

Dulfy's has photos: [http://dulfy.net/2018/11/23/fallout-76-apparel-and-outfits-guide/](http://dulfy.net/2018/11/23/fallout-76-apparel-and-outfits-guide/)
---
*AND YOUVE BEEN GNOMED*
---
Xbox, ps4, pc...?
---
Thank you for this list /u/HelpVoom 
---
I've seen it with a Quad Combat Shotgun favorited at the same time as an Executioner's Combat Shotgun.
---
I think that it's obvious that the best fix for this is to combine the two weapons and add "Instigating". That logic is clear, right?
---
It's still a good money saver until you have most of the plans. Workshop griefing still isn't that common, so you usually get away with it. Just keep your junk in the stash and switch server if you get caught.
---
First of all, you should get a 24hr ban for name calling and trying to insult me multiple times just because you don’t agree with me (just thought I’d leave that there for the mods) not really “keeping it civil” by any means... but w/e sorry if I hurt your feelings.
---
Second, again Your initial comment is totally misleading. If someone who has never laid eyes on fallout 76 read your comment, “typical Bethesda launch / bugs” does not tell the full story for how broken the gameplay is, by any means??? sorry. I get you are in denial like most people on this sub, but tell the full story next time. YOU presume that you know exactly how and why this game tanked based on the comments YOU personally read in the discord’s YOU follow, and you are wrong :/ sorry 
---
You cant just go and group a bunch of PRIMARY issues together into one sub issue, then stick it on the very end of your list reasons why the game has been poorly received? How does that make any sense? Again, it has nothing to do with Fo4, the data leaks, the canvas bags etc. those were all icing on the cake, and the game was already in a state of disrepair at that point, and still got a fair shake by us true fans who were there since day 1 and preorder every Bethesda game since Morrowind. Stop downplaying bad gameplay and making excuses for it when there are none.
---
And lastly, don’t give me that “it’s to prevent spam” crap, because I’m pretty sure you used to be able to upload photos to both r/fallout and r/Fo76 before 76 fully released and it got messy, in fact here’s one of the first photos added to the sub that is still up. 
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9tgnra/fallout_76_beta_photos_what_did_you_take_a_photo/
---
Strange that they just decided to change photo sharing how they did. I don’t chalk it up to spam considering there are PLENTY of subs for huuuuuge games with huuuuuge fan bases that have just as many users AND still allow you to add photos... And I don’t wanna hear about Filthy casuals and fallout settlements considering they are small ass subs with 1/5 of the users, aren’t even Bethesda run, and they’re full of biased players who will give the game a pass, no matter what you say about it. If this game was doing numbers and had an amazing community I guarantee they wouldn’t be blocking you from posting your in game photos... you know, considering one of the biggest things they talked up at E3 was the Photomode and photo sharing. Just saying
---
Nailed it. 😏
---
I had the same issue due to the beta.  Not sure if this is what happened to you, but if you visited a ton of locations before the end of the beta then that character will never be able to complete those challenges.  The only way to get them is to do them again on an alt character (all your characters share the same pool of achievements).
---
I only just recently did the ones you're talking about.  No amount of going back there will ever make it trigger, you have to actually have the "discovered location xyz" dialog appear on your screen to get them to check, and a character can't discover the same place twice.
---
Big iron on his hiiiip. It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round,  there before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground.
---
I run with 3 different combat knives on my melee character and boy is it annoying having to fix my favorites every single time I log onto that character. Here's hoping /u/ladydevann sees this and can report it up to the development team!
---
&gt;  I can try to pressure him into making it public if you want ?
---
Why not? No better way to put this argument to bed than to post a video publicly detailing the exploit.
---
I play on all platforms my man......but i play fallout 76 on xbox uno
---
Honestly the roadmap has me right back at max hype, been playin all week and loving it :)
---
Yea tho the vibe was excellent, full of promise, i member.
---
Thanks so much, I'm on PC though. I could ask my group of friends if they still have them.
---
Have you scrapped every item in your camp down to zero built/stored items?  I see you saying you rebuilt your camp, but to me that means stashed and then placed again so I just wanted to check and see if you tried scrapping literally everything in camp.
---
If you haven't tried that, I'd suggest scrapping the lot, then relogging, then moving the camp and seeing if it starts over where it should.
---
Never played The Sims, Fortnite, or Minecraft, but the game I referenced is one hell of a survival experience. Unfortunately you were stuck with boring PVE or grief-central PVP servers. 
---
I’ve always been a fan of creating fortifications to defend against the world, and would happily kill ghouls and scorchbeasts all day every day.. but it got monotonous. 
---
After reaching level 200+ I just couldn’t do the treadmill work anymore. You can only collect so many weapon and armor combinations before the stash is full, and being a junk hoarder in the game doesn’t help either. The queen became the only “challenge” - regular scorchbeasts were flat out farmable. 
---
I just thought it would be fun to have events where mobs come after your base. 
---
Yes you're correct, tested it out, got beat up my some ghouls and squatted down, waited for the sneak to clear from red and I watched the health bar promptly move to full health. Just goes to show :)
---
Sadly im a pc user for 76
---
I love finding the little notes found around the place... one I always remember was I think the North Tower Lookout?  Finding the planters on the way up, seeing how someone trying to live there, and making it to the top and reading the note.  Considering its remoteness, it really did give it a humanity side of what it might be like for a couple in the wild after such a catastrophic event.
---
These little side stories, that have nothing to do with quests, are great little gems found scattered around.  of course, sometimes these are found in amongst 'hot zones', and you don't get the time to sit and read them while trying to survive - which is why I collect everyone I find so that I can make time later to sit and read through... but being able to read them at the site you find them is a better in-context experience.
---
interesting
---
It applies to everyone and everything but the user.
---
I didn’t play the beta
---
The swamp plant challenge is bugged. I've looted strangler pods and strangler bloom/blossoms and it hasn't counted.
---
checking account
---
savings account
---
Great idea, I love it!
---
I was playing with a friend. We are both level 30. Two level 100 players walked up to us and started having random gun shots at us. We just kept playing. Then they started firing rockets at us. We just walked away to another area of the map. Didn't die and went on our way.
---
Eh. Decent's a bit much, but it does kinda amuse me how many sawed off rifles there are. 
---
The apocalypse comes and you make your guns LESS effective? I don't really buy it. Shotguns? Sure! Hunting rifles? no. 
---
Going off of this, I wish we could carry a tent and use it as a bed, scrap bench, and loot box. I don't want to break down my home base for this.
---
You get it for free 👀
---
Watch the captain noob video on the combat shotgun. May help sway you. 
---
And i can make it not for 1500 tho 
---
personally, I think they should do what a lot of other games do to limit actively stored files...allow for easy transfer to alts. Most games I play have "shared bank" capabilities that let you pull items from one profile, transfer them over to another, non-active profile. 
---
Combine that with limited profiles, and the ability to purchase new characters after, say...5? You want more bank space, buy another save file for $10. 
---
Playing with people is the attraction for me... sadly most people seem to have stopped playing.
---
Of course!!! That figures , well its probably for the best.....that way you don't have to encounter buttholes like me haha, no man , seriously i love the entire franchise , have always been a huge fan, for me this game was always important, i dont play sports games or anything else pretty much haha , all of these triple A companys are consecutively bombing so i don't waste the cash. But do consider either getting a proper p.c. , or say f it and go oculus with it?
---
I mean...yeah, no. I'm not taking "you're the problem" from the creepy dude who stalked through my post history because he thought it would "fuck with me"? 
---
I've built lots of generators but still not working
---
No problem!
---
I had originally played with two mates during the beta one didn't get the game after it and the other returned it
---
So question...in FO4 if you cleared a location it showed it on the map..does 76 do this? Or is an area never really cleared because of respawns?
---
Combat Shotgun - because Enforcer isn't necessarily about damage, it's about landing as many hits as possible as quickly as possible.
---
I have a Quad Hardened Combat Shotgun for this, which holds about 34 shells.
---
Cheers, will do.
---
We know slap damage can eventually kill you.  Nobody is dying from a few slap hits unless they are almost dead anyway.
---
Yeah I am starting to lose interest as there are fewer and fewer people for me to play with.
---
From what I understand, she is classified as an animal and subject to the Hunter's prefix.
---
No offense, but from my perspective it’s more likely you are mistaken about your pvp flag.
---
So the idea is to force'em to land via crippling basically? Is it consistent enough?
---
That was my understanding as well thanks. Guess I’ll be keeping that 3* hunters auto grenade launcher. 
---
...human lifespan isn't 20 years, dude. 
---
It really everything posted here is anecdotal.  What’s your point?  Are you implying we should believe some anecdotes but not others?
---
I am perfectly ok with a 800 stash limit. ITs enough to keep 200 of every mat,1-2k various light ammos and 50 radaway/stimpacks  on overstock. I also keep one of every outfit and like 2-3 guns. If they maxed out at 1k id have enough room to keep cooking matts like bourbon,salt and so forth. After that your just extreme hording for no reason.
---
I wouldn't mind a deep stash but it would ruin me. Id keep one of everything and 20k of everything else i use. Combine that with the games horrible inventory interface. I would be in storage for hours at a shot checking for duplicate junk  items i don't need. 
---
r/Amish
---
2 tato, 2 corn, 2 mutfruit + purified water = 2adhesive
---
Go to challenges and play time is in there somewhere
---
Nobody is saying slap damage cannot kill you.
---
Any shotgun with enforcer and conc fire and you can land and totally cripple a SB no problem.  Arguably the most broken perk in game right now.  
---
Does not work on SBQ
---
What you are describing is not one-shotting.  You can see why people are so suspicious of these claims.
---
Same issues here. I have a vampire combat rifle chambered in .38 and a furious combat rifle and had to fix favorite menu for it. I have so many variations on same weapons that I can't really use the favorites
---
Can you use your words?
---
Maxed out, fully modded Deathclaw damage &gt; that of  Power Fist, but Power Fist can have varied damage types and is lighter. Don’t forget Mole Miner Gauntlet which falls somewhere between the two in max damage. As another poster already stated, your choice will most likely be decided by the legendary affixes. They’re all insanely fun to use!
---
This seems like a good post for advertising as a mercenary. Anyone need a mercenary?
---
Ikr!! I'm in love. DC is my fav ❤️
---
&gt; Workshop griefing still isn't that common
---
That hasn't been my experience at all.  The 2/19 patch makes them easy to contest and impossible to defend.  And that has basically been my experience with workshops ever since the patch. 
---
I got every plan I needed without taking over a single workshop and without buying them. 
---
I did the powering up events for the power plants, which gave me plans for fusion generator.  But powering up missions don't claim the camp which means you don't have to worry about it being contested.   Joining defense of other peoples' workshops is another way to get the same plans without the headache of claiming it.  Defending workshops appear as event missions that you can join. 
---
Unfortunately this has been in the game since the beta. Don’t worry, another 3 months and they’ll get around to it. 
---
Vanguard sentinel or vanguard Cavalier or a mix. 
---
Yeah, maybe.  But people should ask if the person wants them to remove the wanted level somehow.  Don't just assume its ok to blow them away, they might not even realize they had one.  Then there's the issue of their junk.  Let em get to a stash first, geez.
---
Candles and regular light bulbs take up 1% for each just as additional info 
---
From a guy that has a sneak/snipe build I think this will be fun. It is balanced. If you can have the high armored, full auto, spray and pay build then I should be able to use my sneak duck and cover build? Not everybody wants to go "toe to toe" and finds the sneak hide mechanic part of the game more appealing   
---
Another way to go about it might be to only allow changing pacifist mode on or off in the main menu.
---
&gt; for example, a quad which I haven't seen in a while
---
So glad you finally beat the RNG. ;-) But if I were you I had deposited all those lvl 1 legendaries in the Overseer's Camp's cache.
---
...and so many people wonder why other players run when they see them.  Why bother sticking around to see if a player is friendly when so many aren't.
---
Warruss
---
I've seen it happen multiple times but I've never tried it myself.
---
My friend and I got on the trade business. As well as the house building business. We love finding new places to create cool camps
---
I did not keep the drops. Maybe next time.
---
Is concerned fire a must? I'll need to move another point to per, and I use vats, well, almost never.
---
It's tracked in the one for the character. 
---
yeh its.too risky for me to hold workshops.anymore..sick of being one shotted by people who are farming caps..im lvl 200 so i lose 200 caps each time
---
Log on, sell, events and any straggler quests. Log on to next high level, repeat. Log on to lowbie and do quests.
---
Generally for my high levels I’m still chasing levels, and some gear. I’m not a server-hopper, so on the one I’m still looking for an X01 jet pack I log on, check the vendor ... then do a round of Whitespring and log to someone else. One is a shotgun build, so I like to farm plastic and stuff when I do my circuit to sell / event. Two of them run in PA so occasionally do a circuit looking for cores and killing things on the way.
---
I really have about 5-6 builds I want to try, so working through them all. I have one I want to run totally w/ the Mystery garb ... I want to run a max CHA build ... etc..  Two of my existing are over 100 right now, and one near 60 - others lowbies ...  and have MOST of what I want for them - but I’m still leveling them so I can have 1, 2 and 3 card versions of things like Rifleman.  
---
Cost me more than $10 for a mule account. But that sweet, sweet storage is so worth it.
---
If you can toss +end it would make it a bit better on top, too. 
---
I was going after the nuke key card with a buddy. Got it near white springs. Two sbs show up at that time.  I down the two helicopters easily,  but when going after the drone carrying the key card both beasts just spammed me with their scream attack causing me to miss the drone due to the head shake.  
---
I finally down it and we both collected our cards and my buddy bounced out of there.  I was not about to let those two get away with it.  So I started blasting away taking them both down after a few minutes.  Plus a mothman that decided to show up.  My buddy was telling me just to run the whole time but they ticked me off so bad I couldn't let them slide.  
---
To finally be able to hunt them instead of them hunting me was a gratifying experience.  I no longer run from them out of fear of death only fear of wasting ammo. 
---
Your performance is constrained by the number of draw calls generated by the game environment, lighting system and shadows.
---
The number of draw calls is not something you see in the normal cpu/gpu usage statistics, so it's possible to have low fps while having low cpu and gpu usage, if this is happening it's usually because of the draw calls.
---
The bottleneck is actually in the memory controller of the cpu, in the communications between cpu and ram, that's why you don't see it in the usual statistics.
---
To know how much draw calls your system is generating you can use an ENB in games like Fallout 4, there are benchmarks like 3dmarks API overhead to see how much draw calls your system can run.
---
If you want to improve your performance in this case you need an high speed RAM, and a better, newer cpu (anything with DDR4 helps a lot). Or, alternatively, lowering shadow distance can help.
---
Jamellas Diablo2 editor would like to chat.
---
Aww can you let me know if you get more like this? Or can i help you by doing the same thing? Would love to participate in things like these
---
Same boat.  All three toons.  Nothing but broken weapons today.  Loot crates, corpses, and vendors.
---
I'm a solo player but just had a fun time leading groups of ghouls over to a level 40ish on top of the club house awning so they could tag them or kill them, slowly though they had spawned as 62s. managed to keep three groups around the cars and bus one around the back and then helped kill them. They must have got some nice loot from it. Thumbs up all around.
---
I make my own fun.
---
@this_vid
---
What are you running in perception/how many points do you have, out of curiosity? 
---
Months later and it's still bugged. 
---
I've not been using concentrated fire only enforcer so I'll have to juggle my cards to try it out, I do have it at 3\* I think. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Yeah, that's an option i'm debating if I end up seeing the game for $5-10 again. As it is, I just use a friend to help shuffle stuff, but that's cumbersome. 
---
This is a brilliant theory.  Once I learn how to launch nukes, I'll help. Lol. 
---
Yes, I thought so.
---
