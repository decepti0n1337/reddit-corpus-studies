Sure, I'll have a crack at coming up with some mutations. 
---

---
Blood thirsty
---
Advantage: when something dies in front of you you gain increased attack speed
---
Disadvantage: slower attack speed in general
---
Empathitic bond
---
Advantage: increased movement speed when a team member is downed
---
Disadvantage: decreased strength score
---
Vampire 
---
Advantage: increased movement during the night. turn into a bat when you die, cheaper respawn cost
---
Disadvantage: heal less during the day
---
Third arm
---
Advantage: increased carry weight, you will randomly gain junk
---
Disadvantage: decreased reload speed as your third arm pathetically attempts to help
---
Fire fiend
---
Advantage: increased damage while on fire
---
Disadvantage: you need to set yourself on fire
---
Queen bee
---
Advantage: bee swarms will randomly spawn and assist you
---
Disadvantage: you are weaker to cold and fire damage
---
Out of body experience
---
Advantage: when you get knocked down, you appear as a ghost for 10 seconds and can continue attacking. Scoring a kill has a chance to revive you. 
---
Disadvantage: your maximum health is decreased
---
Puss filled
---
Advantage: anyone who melee attacks you has a chance to be slowed and covered in an unknown substance. Higher chance depending on how many diseases you have
---
Disadvantage: really disgusting
---
Glowing
---
Advantage: you deal rad damage around you, the higher your rads the more damage
---
Diaadvantage: dealing rad damage sucks, so does being irradiated, only really useful for pvp, probably op in pvp, this one is bad now that I think about it
---
Feral
---
Can only be acquired with rads above 70% health, not affected by starches genes
---
Advantage: ghouls won't initiate combat, all your attacks deal bonus rad damage. 
---
Disadvantage: you can be pvp'd constantly (in adventure mode), you take more damage from other players attacks
---
Feral is more of a joke one haha
---
---
---
They probably come from the settlers who tried to attack them with one.
---
Yeah. I'm over a hundred, probably 200 by now. It's ridiculously rare.
---
Here's hoping it's a workable mechanic.  If I end up having to trade 25 legendary drops to get one halfway decent item I might as well just keep selling them normally and try for better drops.
---
This **is** the place. Stop trying to protect someone from their job. Take your high horse into a pasture and kill it. No where is the place.
---
Rule 6. Wtf.
---
Well we all came from mud the primordial soup so to say..but then again I’m a raider and don’t give a damn..-cackles- be smarter than the wastes..or be wasted..I always say..
---
It gives you... food.  But apparently, like dog food, it's OK for vegetarian mutants.

[removed]
---
Like in game midnight? Cause if yes I agree
---
Yeah, I stopped playing a few weeks ago because me and my son's account on his Xbox we're all full of 2 and 3* legendary items.  Am waiting on this prospector guy to cash in my items.  I imagine it'll be a busy place.
---
I was so disappointed when I realized how bad they didn't work in 76. I however killed 1 bloat fly once with them.
---
I'm fairly certain they said it would be instanced.  Out and about right now, so can't easily look it up.
---
Beautiful post.
---
Yeah, you're right.
---
But about the stuttering: You've got the Cell Loading overall. It's not the preloading or anything but the unloading and loading itself. It's loading all of the stuff in it and I believe that's what causes it. In Skyrim it isn't that bad but on Fallout 76, I believe it shows it a lot more because the stuff is running through their servers. Game worlds are hosted from there.
---
For previous titles like Fallout 3 and New Vegas, I believe you see it a lot there as well because they were still working on it there.
---
I haven't noticed this much in Fallout 4 but in SSE for example, I think it's pretty smooth. Sometimes it chugs a tiny bit but I'd say a 95% of the time, it's smooth cell loading.
---
So hope that’s not the issue. I spent shit loads on my ultra wide.
---
Don’t have anything but a Radeon you card.
---
Tomorrow night? 8 or 9 o'clock UCT or whatever works for you guys
---
To answer your last question first which I may have wrong.  Griefing I associate with bullying.  I understand what your getting into when getting into a pvp game but my question was mainly about why and who and the way the aggression takes place.  I don’t know you but you sound intelligent.  If you saw 4 people beating on another person then making fun of it.  Would you have any question of who or why?  In this case my question goes further asking about the psyche of the individuals/ game or no game the act still resonates.  Lastly as I was coming out of the club I said hello to one of the guys.  Coming out I was being shot at I disregarded it and as I was going into the next area (forgot was called, next to the gazebo area) they hanged up and killed me.  I came back to do some pvp’ing but I am no pvp’er so got slaughtered by 4 of them and they kept hitting the dead body and doing other things to it.  Again this is not a this guy is an asshole thing that is easier to say.  The act of it is disturbing to any and if it isn’t is where my question lies.
---
We need this and a green house set!
---
Can’t wait to see price on these once we get player vending lol
---
My heavy weapons toon has 12 or 13 luck I forget. It's really such a strong stat for certain builds... I can see a vats build really wanting unyielding for more AP and stacked luck for all the vats perks.
---
It needs a game wide html auction house/trading post. House collects a percentage of caps as a listing fee. Great way to help keep control of the economy.
---
Never paid more than 300 per on my PS4 account.
---
I'm a console pleb and after the last patch frame rate and server stability has gone down hill. Even the initial or fast travel loading has gotten worse.
---
Lifelong gamer here with plenty of FPS multiplayer and RPG experience. 
---
I sometimes rob people of their junk via Workshop PVP with virtually no regard to their level or consent. 
---
When I see the copious crying here over shot-up wooden box houses, claims of griefing in regard to brief, isolated PVP encounters, and, most troubling, the intensity of scorn towards seemingly any player who hasn't received a written waiver before ever attacking another player...    I feel myself turning more to the dark side. 
---
The myriad announcing that every player kill is done by an irredeemable obese asshole living in a basement have made an adversary of someone otherwise fairly neutral. 
---
I'll give you something to cry about - study that.
---
Or really any set time during the day.  Rather than 20 hours after you first used their fresh caps.
---
Nope

I've always hated crickets.. just the way they jump is disturbing for me
---
I didn't actually say that "why doesn't it happen here if it happens there"
---
Yeah. I run with plane combat armor no legendary. A two shot exp handmade and marsupial. Plus a 45 lever no legendary and a .38 combat rifle no legendary. Nothing really gets in my way. I dont like power armor because its loud af and clunky. Built my camp in the bog about 60 ft from primary fissure on a lead extractor. Thought I'd get some challenge by doing that but really all that happens is my base gets blown up every now and again. A fridge would be cool but at this point I just dont feel like there's anything worth staying for. Im just to damn powerful. One time they spawned queen but didnt kill her in time so everyone just left the area. I was so excited. I had thought it would be awesome to get a group of people dedicated to fighting her 1v1 like a right of passage. Wanted to see how hard it was and if it could be done. It wasnt hard at all. I was taunting her at some points. It just made me angry. I spent an hour pouring ammo into her. Even reset her health until I just stopped and shouted at her through my mike and started punching her in her stupid face. That was the moment 76 finally died for me. When i went totally mental and just started futility punching the end game boss in the face screaming arent you supposed to be a boss... I gave up trying to kill her. Just wasnt worth the ammo and most of my guns were about broken and my vampire ax as well. She defeated me... But in the worst way possible. She defeated my spirit. There was no thrill in the fight anymore.
---
I did this exact thing in the bar I erected in one of the empty lots in Sanctuary.
---
What platform?
---
Good work generally speaking, but TSE aint super gold. The super build-specific weapon-specific gold combinations are the only super golds.
---
Higher intelligence perks determine how well you play
---
No. Lvl 3 is the stack.
---
Yeah, it's really a pain. Sometimes the robots end up on the roof of a building too.  I had a 3* legendary assaultron blow up and couldn't see where it went in the swap outside the city and was walking around looking everywhere for 10 min for it.
---
&gt; Badgering them will not get you a response.
---
Correct, it will not get us a response, but it will **emphasize** how big of an issue this is to the community. It might help escalate to higher ups at bethesda. I say badger away, the only thing here I don't understand is you and people like you. Why are you white knighting the CM's? This is their job. Do you think they're too weak and fragile to do their jobs skillfully? Have they ever given you the idea that they're anything but perfectly capable of dealing with massively messy situations? Personally I've never seen them handle any of the messes that pop up in this subreddit frequently with anything other than poise. So why is it suddenly important we don't voice ourselves to them? 
---
If we stop voicing ourselves to the CM's we risk showing them that this issue isn't big enough for Bethesda to reconsider, the flipside is that they get lots of messages they're able to ignore because they were told to do so. One side of that is fine, the other isn't.
---
25 years locked away underground, plenty of time to learn...
---
No. Only one perk card of any lvl can be carried.
---
Let's nuke it to get even tougher enemies
---
my turret didn't attack the dog when i put my camp near it so you're good but even if it did i think the cats and the dog are permanent creatures that can't die
---
I got into the habit of writing down what time I cleaned one out.
---
Week or two ago I was camping with my family and saw a bunch of almost full containers labeled "aluminum cans only" and considered grabbing some out of there before I snapped back.
---
My two caps worth; the AB increases in power throughout the games series because it's continually being developed by the aliens (considering FO76 is the 'prequel'.)
---
Think about FO76's AB as a Mk.I, in FO4 as a Mk.2 etc etc.
---
Melee build for silos is much better
---
I felt the same until I put some time building a house I can be proud of.
---
I scrapped my mr handy model by accident with scrap all :(
---
It also hasn’t been balanced very well. All the spawns are the same. The enemies just spam one flower until it’s dead. Makes it both really easy, and a bit annoying.
---
&gt; Just let it go for now, man. It's a video game. Relax.
---
That's what they said about EA, look where that shit ended. I don't buy some of my favorite franchises anymore because I'm not going to give any money to EA. This isn't a video game, these are corporate decisions made **about** a video game. It's a very real world issue of a major company breaking promises to their customers. Not just a video game.
---
Never said I didn't want it (I usually have so much cloth I don't need to grab it very often), I was just wondering why it couldn't be sold directly to vendors like other items can be.
---
He actually respawns like every 30-60 minutes, not just daily.
---
https://youtu.be/4j7h2INLjik?t=07s
---
I have been playing solo for the last 3 or weeks. I'm just wondering when I do take the SBQ my self will I even get anything. LOL
---
That's a good idea but kinda complicated for something that should be easy.
---
Don't forget the increased risk and things we cant do lol
---
Are overdrive servos on arms also still broken?
---
I don’t think you understood the question.  I asked this same to another.  If you saw 4 people killing a person in the street would it bother you and would you question it?  Crying about this has no validity in my question.  If it doesn’t bother you and your ok with doing it then those are the people I am trying to observe.  I mentioned two kinds of personalities those who were bullies and those who were bullied.  Who are the main culprits in the action.  Now you may have a person who grew up in the Bronx and all they saw is violence those people may actually be a bit more stable because they know what they are doing but if you have a person who had violence thrust upon them then that person could potentially have a big problem.  If you have an observation on my topic let’s discuss but this has nothing to do with some adolescent grief on my killers or the video game world.
---
Yes!
---
You did though, that's the point of the whole post. Implied points are still points. What else are you saying then? What is the take away point if not that?
---
Not this again
---
After tomorrow (if they stick to it) all the vendors will share one big pool of caps. It’ll be much easier to keep track of with only one stop to make.
---
Yeah like noon or 5pm
---
Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

I’m happy to see it . Fuck ballistic fiber
---
I saw a level 1 spawn in the vault and fast traveled there, watched him turn Lvl 2 on the map. I was the first thing he saw outside. Of course, I was in my Raider gear (Ritual Mask, Civil War Dress), so he seemed a bit concerned at first, but he didn’t run away and I gave him some Stims, radaways, and a gas mask
---
Yeah good point glad you reminded me of that! Lol I was late on complaining about that!
---
Yeah, they make a pretty good point that cash won't be worth more than toilet paper in a shtf scenario.  Also hillarious how all the kid and baby toys and paint contain lead in the game.
---
Isn’t that the greatest movie ending?  Yeah, maybe you won’t win, but you won’t lose.  
---
The only issue with the SBQ is when too many people show up initially.  She scales and never corrects.  
---
All the prime receivers on the server won’t take her down.  
---
Yet 3 guys, one doing melee, can wipe her in a minute.
---
I have one thing to say to Bethesda. If you turn this into a P2W game you will not have one less F76 player. You will have one less customer. Because I will never trust you again.
---
After 50 instead of choosing a new perk you can choose to swap one point from any stat into a different stat.
---
Thanks!
---
When I played it the other day, enemies were spawning for all the flowers.  Although now that I think of it, each flower had a single enemy type... one of them only spawned wolves, one spawned Scorched, one spawned mole rats, etc.
---
And his first words were, "Mamma!".
---
Exactly, when I raid I go in, steal crops and water, before running off firing shots into the air.
---
Sorry, my bad.
---
The forest
---
I’m looking for a new camp location :) any good lead or junk piles?
---
People are up in arms 'apparently' according to you tube. I get why people will be annoyed that there in the Atomic shop bit honestly I don't think it will give any real advantage?
---
As has already been said, with a few simple perk cards things don't break very often and when they do it's not really that much if an effort to find the bits to repair then.
---
 You don't have to purchase them. 
---
I think some people and unfortunately people online with a lot of Influence like to bash FO76 because it will get views but I LOVE FO76. 
---
(a few less glitches would be nice though)
---
Same here. Aid up the wazoo, which is lucky, 'cause that wazoo needs plenty of help
---
I finally had a radscorpion omelette that cured me, but now I'm missing the roleplaying of constant drinking in the wasteland so I might get addicted again.
---
That would be sweet.
---
Sorry, bit of misinfo there, they changed the weight a while back and it’s actually a bit lighter than purified water.
---
I don't know where I got one but it was the first one I cared to do it on got it on my 4th or 5th try.
---
Fuckkkkk....so I legit missed the opportunity?!
---
Well, there was one very helpful guy who compiled a map of every resource location, i jusy don't know how to link posts :/
---
Expecting a direct response is just . . . unlikely.  If Bethesda has an official response, they'll make it.  If they don't, their staff aren't going to make something up, other than the "this is a neat suggestion, we'll pass it along" stuff they already do.
---
Grape mentats and some magazine stacks with lvl 3 hard bargain.
---
OMG thats what happened! There was so many of us at first I didn't realize she had scaled up. Makes sense now.
---
I know, it sucks.
---
Hmm ok
---
A few patches back there used to be literally hundreds of robots at whitesprings constantly respawning and the servers endured that.
---
Having a handful of robots spread out over the map at player camps shouldn't be a big deal. ;)
---
It's gonna be Abit before the new code is decoded. A few hours at least.
---
Okay, thank you
---
Wow. thats really impressive. 
---
I must admit I have been to West Tek quite a few times and I don't encounter legendarys hardly at all.
---
am I looking in the wrong place?? lol
---
Banks in Morgan town
---
Lol
---
Thats my go to entrance when I leave the bunker. I know you can use the entrance by the elevator but I like my Nuka!
---
yeh that was awesome :)
---
I hear you though, I was gonna launch also, then the codes reset. Completely forgot it's reset day
---
My friend wanted to launch a nuke yesterday but we didn't have time
---
Her scaling is bugged.  It’s why I won’t bother if more than 4 or 5 people show up.
---
Should've been a week, not a day.  Any 'outrage' can die out over a day.  If it clogs everything up for a week, you know its got legs.
---
It's usually at least a 2 star for me.
---
Many times they run and hide in the far corners of the building. You have to chase them down which can get pretty exasperating lol.
---
The first 2 weeks of play I couldnt even play. Even though at the time I had a top of the line gaming PC the lag was crazy intense. I had trouble killing anything because i or they would glitch around. Decided they needed to optomize server and gave it a rest tell it left beta.
---
Most entities except for robots, dogs, and cats have white health bars which means that they are friendly, they probably attacked the opossum because of their red health bar. Cheers -HB
---
Keep checking the website, they usually post in about 3 to 4 hours, pretty consistent
---
The alien blaster in 4 was so much worse than a normal Earth made laser pistol!
---
Okay. Thanks again
---
what about outside, The only 1 i have ever seen was round the back near the fusion generator
---
👍
---
Outside is much more rare. In the back I’ve only ever found 4, one of them three star. In the front if you don’t kill the legendaries fast enough they may run around the side of the building.
---
Everytime I see one of these posts I can't help but cringe at the memory of myself munching down the pie without a clue in the world it was anything special.
---
Lol rip. It'll be worse when you find out you can look up the codes and solutions to the puzzles
---
Alpha does not work
---
Gamers rise up!
---
Yeah I totally get that. A kind of work around you can do is store all your aid items and jump off the nearest bridge. You don't lose any caps and you go right down to the bottom of the list again. Having to do this every two hours or so is not the most elegant of solutions but it does work.
---
After level 50 you can choose to move a single point into another special category. As for legendary status that’s just how you sell yourself in the game 😉
---
PC
---
I have a legendary explosive gattling gun that solves that problem.
---
Lol I want a sling bag like the 511 moab 11 but raiderized!
---
There are perk cards specific to every weapon type. Go check out captainoob and search for explosive 10mm. He shows his perks to maximize damage for every weapon he reviews. As of today, he's reviewed 76 weapons.
---
I meant shuffle them around all at once instead of 1 point at a time.
---
Like I said. Id rather they balanced the game before they started adding fridges or repair kits.
---
If it's younger players, maybe they've been playing a lot of Rust; a crafting survival game where everyone pretty much kills any random stranger you come across.  When my 14 year old son first played Fallout 76, the first thing he started doing was getting into fights, right out of the vault.  When I asked him why, he said, "I don't know, because that's how the game is made".   
---
And for me, a 40 year old man, I haven't felt the need to initiate PvP with anyone.  And I think it's just a generational thing and what kind of games you grew up on.  For the type of player where they purposely go out to "kill noobs" maybe they got bullied in games or real life.
---
It’s posts like this that built Reddit’s reputation, and continues to do so. I for one REALLY appreciate your statistical tracking and data. WestTek is my #1 Farm location for acquiring legitimate top tier goods. Though I find WS more “fun”, and thus I do hit there more than West Tek, I’ve often wondered what a good sample size and breakdown would demonstrate. 
---
My results I would say are extremely comparable to your findings. 
---
My one question (which should theoretically have no ultimate impact on the findings, but is more for curiosity’s sake) would be what platform you are on?
---
Thank you for posting this!
---
69
---
Lol hoping its not 250 or something
---
I’m on PS4, I forgot to add that I’ll put it in right now, and thanks!
---
Always strange that shields don’t exist in Fallout.
---
I didn’t even think of this. What if like in the survival game ark survival evolved they took crystal and boosted plant growth
---
You *definitely* should not look up what a weta looks like.
---
It needs to have a stronger version that can drop as a legendary. Like others have said though, it might have to wait until a expansion themes around aliens drops... man I hope not though. I’m just imagining if it had a mod that gave it explosions on kill, like firefly or sunshot from D2...
---
That would be awesome but hopefully they add both sets sometime down the road! :)
---
I have been saving legendarys from completing quests and grinding blast zones for such a long time. These wonderful one star legendarys are sure to bring smiles upon all of the buyers at my vending machine. Don't murder esch other there is plenty to go around.
---
Yeah I hope!
---
I feel ya. Lvl 120 and found my first explosive weapon too... a black powder pistol :( It's 3 \* too!
---
What level are the guns
---
Spacesuits are worth a fair bit. You can get 2 at a time from the space station. Location here: [https://fo76map.com?locationIds=1208](https://fo76map.com?locationIds=1208)

In airlock C7, code is 111418.
---
Good to know. I myself am on XB1, and your post does lightly motivate me to run the same experiment to see how it compares, but I fully admit that it probably won’t happen due to that infectious disease I have known as laziness.
---
This would be awesome not just got your account but to gift to other players.
---
Ever driven out in the country? Road signs might as well be paper to even the weakest of bullets.
---
I’ve had this problem, just change servers that usually puts it back.
---
Oh yeah luck has a lot of quality perks. And the unyielding does help me stay in vats much longer. Also one gun army is great for heavy gunners if you haven’t got it already.
---
Do you have marsupial?
---
Oooo thank you!! I'll have to do some places I didn't :)
---
All PA has more built in rad resistance that isn’t visible.
---
I don’t kick hella ass.  I can hold my own. 3 SB?  No worries.  3 Yao guai and I’m running like a bitch.  Lol.  And col. gutsies.  They suck too.  Maybe cave crickets.  
---
I only hate SB because they waste bullets and time for no payoff.
---
Not the recipe anymore
---
Sold out 
---
Only the marsupial serum
---
The first 50 or so runs were fun just trying to see what I could get, but after that it was a struggle. I just got bored after awhile. I also may have been 700 pounds over encumbered and using 3 stimpacks per run lol.
---
*Survivor's diary, day one, Appalachia*  
---
I've emerged into a hellish world ruined by war and radiation. As soon as I left the safety of the vault, I was accosted by a terrifying figure dressed in ragged wraps and what appeared to be a tattered civil war suit. He gave me some water and medical supplies. Nice guy.
---
I did, and it worked. I freaked out for a minute, though.
---
They just reset so just wait a couple hours and they'll be up
---
I wanted the serum
---
I can’t wait for a nuka cola crafting station. sorry biv I’ll be hanging out with bubbles. Imagine a crossover quest “biv &amp; bubbles” at the end you have to decide if you want to give a shipment of nuka darks to biv or bubbles for different rewards.
---
I’m an anti-Bloodied build. I don’t like my health bar ever to drop below 75 so I have Born Survivor Level 3, plus 500 stims and 500 Radaway at all times. 
---
Probably why despite being level 225, I really kind of suck at the game. :)
---
It’s one of the objects you have to get out of your power armor for, or it has a unique animation where you tie your power armor down on the back when you get in.
---
That’s very true, but its a god gun compared to 76’s lol this thing is like a rubber band gun
---
If only I could craft nuka grapes.
---
Dang. I don’t think I’ve ever even gotten 500 stimpacks total.
---
They’re diluted.
---
Like that matters. Lol.
---
Still though lol
---
I never pay for those either, lol.
---
Still though lol.
---
Am in my late 40s and also see no need to pvp.  Actually I still can’t believe am playing video games but this is the only one I play and I enjoy it.  
---
It’s disturbing that young people kill in such fashion (and as a non professional I assume it’s young people) it’s why I pose the question who.  A person who grew up in the Bronx and has seen violence knows what they are doing but if it’s a person who has been bullied then that is more disturbing as they are displaying their frustration thru this medium, they are looking for this aggression.  Can this translate to the real world?
---
Thank you for telling me how to properly perk my character. I will definitely make these changes
---
I’d only be willing to pay for the fridge if they let me customize it with magnets.
---
both Lvl 35
---
I've never had it happen on the queen. Lately since the last patch all that loot stays in there. Mostly for me, Whitesprings is where I see loot disappear with people who are not even in my team. The legendary stuff always stays but the other stuff like harden mass and radiation fluid will disappear if I'm not quick enough.
---
I now have a mighty need.
---
Omg all laser pistols I get are ultracite and it annoys me that the regular laser pistol parts don't transfer to that one
---
Yeah. I buy full stims in bulk on Market 76 and then dilute them regularly. I think most I’ve had at once is 750 diluted stims. 
---
Traveling pharmacy is permanently equipped in Strength, obv.
---
I'd add the Generals steakhouse to your Robco visits. And bigbys red rocket to your Harper's Ferry visits. And the power station just north of watoga when you go down there.
---
I get a lot of three stars at the random spawn points around those same areas too. I make a run from thunder mountain past abbies bunker and almost to the fissure site way up north and hit 4 or 5 random spawns.
---
And I do events. Pretty much anything in the savage divide, mire and bog. I get 3 star honey beasts semi regularly doing irrational fear. And 3 star legendaries quite often doing heart of the swamp. Even census violence will throw a legendary mirelurk queen at you in the right spot sometimes. Plus all the well known events.
---
1 star drops from 3 star enemies are just something you have to deal with in a rando looter shooter. I get my fair share. But the whitespring throws out more than it's fair share. I'm convinced the loot table is crappified to make up for the legendary spawn rate.
---
Thats not a bad idea. Might give it a try. Thanks
---
How about those bubble turrets? I want those so my turrets can actually hit something standing next to my walls.  They are already in game.
---
Where? I can just find it for 60$ (PC)

No shit. I was holding out for the sole survivor but I ran into a level 241 last night who sold me a two shot lever for only a grand. Only thing I want now is the action hero. Then I'll have a two shot dragon, lever, gatling, gatling plasma, AND 50 cal lmao

Yeah p much, the longer u love the more likely boogie men are gonna getcha
---
I wasn't the owner. I went there, someone other than me and the owner ( i think his friend) contested and they were able to kill me..
---
Can you explain please?
---
Not really. I noticed that many people feel this way whether its through playing post apocalyptic video games or simply watching shows like the walking dead. I think its a commentary on the fact the the current reality of the world in which we live is unnatural to our humanity and we desperately want to go back to a simpler life away from going to work to earn a paycheck, paying bills, and constantly having to obey other people's rules and laws.
---
I swear they're the larva of cazadors or something. Evil bastards.
---
Bullet sponge, robot distraction, making head hacker/lockpicker's job easier.
---
What is missing?
---
Piss they remove player vendor machine from this update last minute I have 150 plans I need to sell
---
Rude
---
Toenails are the worst part. Luckily that's usually at the very end
---
When I'm watching fallout 76 YouTube, which is pretty rare, I usually like watching JuiceHead, he usually brings the news but keeps it positive and doesn't jump on the hate-train that some other channels like to do.
---
that's why i never love.
---
Are you talking from a theory or experience? On ALL occasions when my camp were attacked, I let players in unlocked. They used my workbenches then started to grief after they saw nice pixels. Never again. When the camp is locked with trap, no one dares (though I placed purifiers unlocked outside that they can loot).
---
I'm set then, just need to spend my next few levels on animal friend bc I'm level 11? Something. 
---
Thanks for the info! Soon I'll go get me a cool creature :)
---
They had the opportunity to respond and they haven't, which is your response. They don't care and are going through with it.
---
Yeah, I get that. I was responding to the person who can’t get the quest to trigger after the first time. 
---
I think you can just deposit it even if you don’t get the marker. I accidentally turned off the marker once. Now I don’t get the quest in the top right of my screen but I can still drop it off for a reward.
---
The right perks? FO4 survival is fun for testing no meta builds. That game is not for optimize your build and the perks, challenges and limitations are pretty good for roleplay.
---
You just gotta shoot them in the head lol. Yeah there's a few enemies that can suprise me. I dont like any of the bug creatures. The movement is jarring and they freak me out. The only thing that really gets my blood pumping are dominater assaultrons and sentry bots if i dont see them coming. But they are so few and far between. This is fallout. Its supposed to be gritty. I should be fighting for my survival in a post apocalyptic world where if I have to live with the consequences of my actions or even die as a result of them. Not a walk through the park where I'm leasurely strolling and killing anything unlucky enough to cross my path. I want every inch of groud to be a struggle, not for "legendary" creatures to start running from me like cowards. I want stories that make me question my morals and make me weigh life vs personal gain. I want mirky water not some damn joke. I wanted to be tested. Not to be a tester.
---
Imbgiving them away
---
To each their own I guess.  Heck, I'd spend real world money on a character respec or on a backpack that gave me another +100 carry weight.  Or even an extra large stash chest.  I'd have no problems spending real world money on extras like that.  It's the only incentive for them to keep working on and advancing the game.
---
Look up gamermomover50 on YouTube. She did a video on building on that location.
---
Yes
---
I’m really excited about this one and the sheepsquatch one. Hopefully they’re both not temporary.
---
Not sure but I think there's something in the timeline saying that super mutants shouldn't exist yet.
---
Yes, sold a piece of chameleon sentinel heavy combat armor to someone once
---
today they restarted
---
This was one of the most community building events and I agree it should go back to the 'broken' way.
---
It turns out all this time and push to talk was on.  I never use it, so it never occurred to me.  An update must have turned it on.
---
Is it Rifle who endorses RMT?
---
Me luv you long time.
---
What about unyielding chameleon? Lol doubtful since they are prefix buffs. I like my unyielding bos sentinel and my unyielding cavalier bos but I don't use my cavalier as much. So trying to find equal trade.
---
Brb super inspired to work on my camp for another four hours.
---
Thats sad to hear. You shouldn't have to. They should have already worked on the game. Thats what you originally paid for. You deserve better. Unfortunately some of us dont have anymore than the amount we already paid for to give.
---
Anyone?
---
Yea, my bad. I'm still enjoying it and I played from beta. I go all the way back to Morrowind.
---
Good job
---
I'm ruffle build.  I dawn power armor and tank it. While also clearing trash mobs so the bloodied can dps the queen.
---
Start a go fund me:p
---
Me, too.
---
Honestly... I'm thinking their idea for the repair kits has a bit more nuance that can't really be explained against a semi-volatile community. 
---
  
---
The fact that they improved ones will come from things like the SBQ is likely what they were PRIMARILY wanting to promote. Gotta be honest, at high level of play, receiving one from something as simple as a SBQ kill could lead to some serious potential stock piling if the player decides to repair as normal for a bit. 
---
I really think they'll be a tad more common than people realize. As long as you aren't solely depending on repair kits, I don't think you'll ever feel really pressured to buy the basic 100% versions. 
---
And again, at high levels of play, who's looking to repair to only 100% anyway? The weapon and armor repair perks have me spoiled. 200% or bust. Especially with melee weapons where it increases damage. A 100% isn't that amazing of a boon, and the 150% is really the only worthwhile patch job I'd spend the extra inventory space to carry.
---
It's not ideal. I'm with everyone in saying I'm really not a fan of money making anything "easier". But I'm really not as bothered by it as some are. If they're going to put stuff like this in the shop, I'm fine with it, as long as I never feel obligated to purchase them.
---
Increasing weapon deterioration rates alongside it/not fixing the issues with it currently before it releases would be malicious as can be. Fix that though? Eh, whatever. 
---
Same with food storage. I get the feeling that the current decay rates are a bit bigger of a fix than people might realize. I really don't think whatever is causing it to be a permanent feature. I'd imagine they'd somehow offer an improved "free and earned" option much like the repair kits. Perhaps inventory preservation salts for purchase via ATOMs able to be used for current inventory aid, and craftable/earnable versions alongside an earned or perhaps single purchase ATOM store item. Food preservation is a tricky subject considering CAMP vending is coming (and was pushed back). 
---
Would food decay while in stash up for sale? The obvious answer is hopefully of course not. If its for sale and is made decay stagnant because of this, what's to keep people from putting 5k cap each for their meals that no one would ever buy in order to preserve it for themselves? Without food decay adjustments and improvements, essentially all cooked consumables would be off the list of things worth selling. That would not be ideal. Whatever the food preservation tech ends up being, it will have to play in tandem with all of these factors in order to not get abused. Whatever it ends up being, I doubt it will be as simple as 100% repair ATOM kits and 150% repair earned kits.
---
Again. Not ideal. But a system adjusted to make the ATOM purchases enticing but in NO WAY essential would make this bearable. At least for me. As long as I never have to do a dungeon where if I'm fully prepared and my weapon breaks part way through, and I then feel like I need to jump in the ATOM store just to continue, I don't really care too much. 
---
Just playing devils advocate, please don't hurt me yall I love you folks.
---
Go tea bag some mutants, can clear that amount of caps in an hour-ish worse case selling Assault Rifles :p
---
Post-nuclear wasteland feels more promising
---
U on xbox? I have handmade for 750
---
Platform?
---
You have a poor understanding of context. In this situation very real world was meant to counteract the point that this is just a video game. This isn't some big issue, it's just an issue found in the real world, it's not some stupid thing in a video game.
---
I guess I didn't explain this type of game well enough to you. You don't use sneak with a hazmat suit all by yourself in a nuke farming zone for leveling. Nobody does. The ghouls are ffa which means anyone is free aggroing all. The only time for low level using sneak is for loot when all enemies are down. If you know the mechanics of the game, you will enjoy more playing the game.
---
Yeah, of course I do. Why else would I have so many points in Luck? Frankly every character needs a bit of luck for bloody mess and the mutation perks. The only toons that shouldn't be messing around in the mutations are BoS roleplayers.
---
It absolutely is though...
---
2* and 3* legendaries and bloodied legendaries.  Me and my son's character on his Xbox filled.  Am anxiously awaiting player vending and or the legendary prospector to unload it all.
---
Ended 3 months ago...I killed them.
---
Here is the graphic our intrepid friend made with workshop locations denoted.
---
[Vault 76 resource locations with workshops](https://imgur.com/c4nbwNo)
---
Guess not.
---
Last time I counted, BGS owes me 800 atoms for challenges that are bugged that I've completed.
---
You'll want to pick a primary weapon type and heavily spec into that. Maybe a few perk cards in a secondary. Always keep an eye out for overlapping type specifications as well, Melee/Heavy Gunner/Shotgun I think you can squeak by with the same SPECIAL setup. 
---
Also shed/sell weapons that are far under your level. Level 5 Two-Shot isn't going to help a level 50 etc
---
The one I'm unsure of, is if Explosive Damage perks also effect Explosive Legendary Effect Weaponry. I should remember this by now...
---
It's the Savage Divide for me.  I love the views you can get in the area and the abundance of resources in the area.  It's such a nice place for me.
---
Melee swing recognition is very off since the update you’re right. If you made a post about it I would upvote it for sure. Had to shelf my melee character since then :(. Can’t stand hitting something 4 times, hearing the damage sound and seeing blood splatter, yet doing 0 dmg, until finally the 5th hit one shots the enemy.
---
Appreciated you held it, I need it but on Xbox.  Thanks for your efforts.
---
It sounds like when it gets to that point it is either hide under the bed, or take matters into your own hands.... 
---
Kind of morbid either way I suppose
---
Speculation here as well, but I imagine all the vendor and camp stuff will drop at the same time next month. We are supposed to have indestructible camps coming as well. They probably want to make sure all this stuff is working right before throwing it out there.
---
Once we get the indestructible camps do you suppose monsters will still be able to break stuff? If so I can see griefers leading packs of monsters to your camp to destroy it. Heck I do that at whitesprings with the turret towers. Lol!
---
lol thanks if you needed to know i'm upper 70's now
---
True, if you worry about that sort of thing. My main Gatling gun is a two-shot explosive that I got legitimately and as long as I'm relatively close with the first one I still get my sneak hits.
---
If I do it out of armor and back far enough I can usually get several sneak hits before they come in anyways. Really good tip for when it's party game on in scenarios like events and the scorchbeast queen. PVP sucks so I'm not worried about that.
---
Yeah that last part kinda irks me, my favorite faction is BoS, yet their against mutations. I really hope when they add factions that’s not like a rule if you pick BoS, then I’d be forced to go raider, or even worse, Enclave! Lol.
---
I would highly recommend it. I started a fresh build specifically for survival and have really enjoyed the added tension. I'm level 21 now and haven't found problems with people camping or "griefing" and have actually had a number of friendly encounters. I think there is this misconception that survival mode is death match mode.
---
I do know one legit person that got a ban for having 100k ammo in his inventory.
---
Bet
---
So then you’re there for the experience, with the threat of running into the purge
---
Oof
---
Ah I didn't want to assume, but I figured such examples would help regardless of level :p
---
Dodgy, and serendipity too
---
Also I'm lvl 24
---
Yee
---
Is ammo “rare?” You should be good.
---
Handmade plans from vendor is 1539 caps
---
It's the stickied post on front page. You pay real money for them. Bethesda promised they wouldn't do this. They lied
---
How is a company who lied to its customers a video game problem? They lied over a video game, but a real company lied to real people. None of that occurred in a video game and ultimately has nothing to do with a video game. That's like saying a milk company lied to its customers and put preservatives in the milk after advertising preservative free milk. That's not a milk problem it's a company that lied to its customers, backtracked on promises. It has very real world consequences. I say very real world not because it's some mega issue, but because it's not happening in some pretend world.
---
and thus they did so i do appreciate it :D
---
Doubt it’d happen for something trivial like normal 5.56 or 5mm. You already know hard Ultracite ammo is to make in bulk and so far out of most of the ban emails I’ve seen, it’s only been extreme amounts of the more rare ammo, like Ultracite.
---
Yeah so did I when it happened the first time
---
0/10 I was expecting "I can show you the world" from Aladdin.
---
I did laugh when the drums started and you where playing them in game
---
So basically a mail system and not an account bank lol
---
REEEEEEEEE
---
Nah but you make good points and this is nice and well thought out. I always love thought out comments.
---
I see a Deathclaw fighting ants every time I hit up the Power Station north of Watoga...Deathclaw is usually losing....and usually the first to die from my TS Fatman....the ants survive somehow.
---
GeeZ
---
This would be nice but I would settle for the camps just being closer to each other. Also take the circle radius we have now and make it square so we can get it closer to our friends. You could build cool little towns that way and as long as it was blue printed you could pop it down pretty much anywhere.
---
The substation just north of Watoga spawns ants a lot. And a deathclaw so watch yourself.
---
Everyone inside the event that's not in team with the owner is considered to be in team with all other event participants. Once i joined powering event there was like 5 guys doing it and i started contesting workshop what put all powering event participants hostile vs workshop owner then i was sitting hidden and laugh hard on sudden war going on there 😂.
---
Strange in numbers utterly fucks with adrenal reaction. That’s probably what’s going on for you. I’ve taken it out of my builds until they fix it.
---
Hey hey hey... Enclave is the best! Well some of us... and by some of us I mean I am.
---
Looks like I might have to finally do the excavator questline. Lol
---
Just say no to virtual welfare.
---
West tek is my main farming spot. My camp is fairly close by so that i can run through once when i first login and again before i log out. My findings are probably pretty similar to yours, although i have never tracked it like this. Very well done. And now i kind of want to do the same thing! Lol. 
---
I would say that most, if not all of my currently equipped gear is from West Tek. 
---
One big detail that i would like to add, is that those times when you/we find multiple legendaries enemies and multiple 3* enemies on the same run, if i stay on that server for long enough to do multiple runs on West Tek, i will find similar numbers of legendary enemies each time. It could very well be a coincidence, but its happened many times now. If i leave and join another server i may find one or no legendaries at all. I have found this seems to work on both adventure and survival mode.
---
I’m not white knighting anything. The community managers have undoubtedly already made the people who are actually in charge of these issues aware of the communities response. They also know from YouTube comments, forum posts on Bethesda.net and everywhere else. The severity of player concern is as known as it can get. 
---
Further comment spam about the issue isn’t going to get them to a solution any faster and the CM’s have already done everything they can do until they’re given more information. It isn’t about them being weak or lacking in ability to do their jobs. It’s about the fact they’ve already done their jobs. So stop trying to personally attack me. It just makes you look like a jackass, honestly. And that kind of behavior is the stuff that will get them to show less concern. Screaming like an angry chimp never gets anyone anything.
---
That'll mess with the value of guns a bit, but I think I beat up the Prison north of Morgantown when I was in that level range. Inside can be a bit chaotic but outside is a pretty safe farming spot. Tons of mutants at that place!
---
i was honestly thinking they should be used like area chat for camps
---
If not those whitespring turret bases starting to make A LOT MORE SENSE to me now...
---
45, as it’s a .44 revolver, but it dropped at .45 on my level 37 character
---
I never sit above 25k of a particular ammo. But the message says "crafted in a 30 day period."
---
Yea, fuck crickets....ludicrous damage per hit for what they are...if I'm lucky, I can cripple their legs with a shotgun. At least then  they can't chase me..
---
Oh god those things gross me out, when I see them I shutter when I see them but I don't have a problem killing them just they gross me out almost as much as those ticks. Keeping Speed Demon Mutation will make them easy to run away from along with Marsupial will help to get some where they can't get to.
---
Heck, even if they just gave you a pre-made stall with a cool robot that would work. You could put the stall inside your structure or just put it outside.  Add faction robot skins to the drop tables or atom store and we would be golden. We could finally have company too. Lol
---
If you're on PC I always have hundreds of screws to give away lol. People follow me around and pick up the enormouse amounts of junk I leave laying around. Left 130 screws at ws yesterday
---
Not asking for specifics. Just a mod or someone reliable to tell me "you're good."
---
-mail boxes with a limited capacity of ten. To leave gifts for players who's camp you use out in the wild as a thank you.
---
-mounted creature head wall plaques. Already exist in game. Should only drop as a reward for killing one of the mega monsters. Kill a mirelurk queen, drop a plan to craft her head on a plaque. Same for flatwoods monsters, mothmen, sloths, fog crawlers etc. Would be nice to see other people's accomplishments displayed in their camps. Would be nicer yet if there were actual regional bosses. 
---
-specific item containers. Fridges that hold 25 food items that dont perish. 
---
Medicine cabinets to hold extra aid items, etc. Sorting would be lovely. The fermenter shows only beverages, this must be possible even if it all draws from the stash. 
---
-paintings that import your screenshots from the in game cameras. Self explanatory. 
---
-garden plots, and greenhouse walls and roofs. 
---
-more kiychy clutter. This is the one thing I will spend atoms on. Newly meshed objects. Those little cactuses and the fish lamp.. awesome! More of those. Nuka cola souvineers, west Virginia lore and historical items. I know some of this may happen with the up coming patches but I'd like more than what's in game.
---
-bendable, or some sort of updated easy way to place electrical lines. I may be doing it wrong but even with the connectors its clunky
---
- our fusion generators should be functional and recharge one fusion core every 24 hours. Put a dead one in and get one back a day later.
---
Same thing happened to me couple days ago I was off during a nuke site after sometime I decided to head back to camp and I noticed a big Bounty near my camp and of course a level 143 is destroying my camp at this point I'm a level 101 and don't feel like taking shit from anyone I turn my mic on and tell him I'ma kick his ass and before I can get to him he leaves the lobby . Just a fucking asshole that's not interested in PvP
---
It would be nice to have a real break from the day to day grind and responsibility of modern life.
---
Same, burns through ammo like mad but it's fun as fuck to use...I still have yet to find a Legendary Plasma rifle I like....Furious or Exterminator would be perfect.
---
I just run from the mole rats. When I hear them surface I turn around and blast them. Works pretty good.
---
Thank you for including this! I'm going to have to check out these spots when I jump on. Upvotes don't do it justice, so a special "gaaaarrryyy" to you!
---
Ya it would be awesome to find plans that gave them different personalities and voices. I love the raider bots! And the dude at harpers fairy is hilarious.
---
 84138947
---
So are you saying that it's glitching my health and causing my damage output to drop?
---
Same here. I almost fell to my death from them.
---
You can get to the top without going inside.
---
Melee + VATS for molerats.
---
They're fairly random. But just taking a workshop for 25 caps is worth the initial rewards you get for them. I hate pvp so I'd just take one, get the initial plans, defend once and server hop. Some things you have to purchase though.
---
Disagree.  The things you get in this PLUS do not give you any more power over other players.  It is QoL things.
---
Pay to win is for 5 dollars you can do 50% more dmg and recieve 50% less dmg for 2 hours.  THAT is pay to win.
---
Yeah I meant 600-1200 for all of the ones you can get from rouletteing. I was using 300 as the average, so that's getting 2-4 set before you start buying
---
It doesn’t glitch your health, it just glitches the damage formula Adrenal uses. Since Adrenal is based on your current health, changes in your health affect your weapon damage. Because the formula is fucked up by SiN, it actually can start giving negative damage
---
Your perspective is wildly skewed. I cant even reason with someone this fargone.
---
+karma
---
Yes, lol
---
Sorry I can't answer your question, but may I ask where you farm steel?
---
Thanks, and good to know!
---
I understand why you think that, but it is not pay to win.  At the end game, everyone in max gear, having that inventory space doesnt give you more power.  So sorry, it is not pay to win.
---
And when that time comes we can start the whinging ;)
---
They don’t bother me too much. Except for the sound they make. Christ.
---
I get that. But if you're melee fighting some mole rats or ghouls it might be nice having that extra protection.
---
Serendipity is amazing for low health builds. You can almost consider it 45% damage reduction all the time. But it has one very unique benefit- it doesn’t suffer any diminishing turns with other %damage reduction effects, because it’s a different category (avoidance, not reduction)
---
And it is happening... look at repair kits.  Might as well try to give some direction on what you would be willing to pay money for.  I know most people here dislike microtransactions but believe it or not -- that is how the future of gaming is going.
---
Because you're wrong, proven wrong and have nothing to stand on. You're still in denial though, I give you props on sticking your head **that** far in the sand. It's impressive, you should maybe run for a political office.
---
Ah, that makes sense! Thank You! I couldn't wrap my head on what was going on!
---
To be fair, it’s like a free vacation to West Virginia every time ya boot it up.
---
Every time I’ve seen an online game implement a mobile/browser system that lets players manage inventory, trade or auction goods, it got abused to the point of completely fucking up the game economy.
---
They do not give a significant advantage over other players.  It is not pay to win, it is pay for QoL, if anything.
---
Pay to win is this:  For 5dollars you will do 50% more dmg and recieve 50% more dmg for 2 hours.  That is pay to win.
---
At end game, both players only can have the same amount of gear equipped, same amount of toon weight (based on str and perks), they are the same power level.  The thing I suggested in PLUS are no pay to win in any form at all.
---
I was just all against Cannibal perk and never used it in all Fallout games I played, but recently realized I was picking up the glowing meat from ghouls and eating them anyway.
---
Yes please. All glory to the Moth.
---
And since you wont pay a sub, that is fine, I would.  For each person that says they wont, there is someone who will.  They might not post it on reddit, but they are out there.
---
Again, this is why pay for PLUS is a good thing -- it lets people who dont want to play, still get game content as the game is expanded since it has a rev-stream.
---
Anyone else saw this  [https://imgur.com/UFvA0cX](https://imgur.com/UFvA0cX) ?
---
I use the on screen crosshairs. And since I got all the big guns perks I register a lot of hits. But the sight on the gun should be functional.
---
—Close
---
* gives you 1 cap
---
Im sorry you feel that way, but companies have been "fucking you in the face" long before this post was made.
---
It is how it is going to be, Microtransactions or pay-per-month, or a combination of both.  That is the only way companies will still develop their product.
---
I can give you a job.
---
Only if we can upload images so we can "print" personalized backpacks
---
I would like the idea of implementing shields, especially if dual wielding was done.
---
Strange in numbers does weird stuff, if my wife shares it and im using only twisted muscles my damage goes down.
---
This may have been addressed, but due to deleted, threads and a very busy sub, I'm curious about something. I get it, BSG is claiming the kits are in response to overwhelming player suggestion. What I don't understand is why they can't be added to loot tables, or to vendors, or somehow added to the game outside of the Atom Shop? 
---
Then they can answer the calls of players, and still maintain a modicum of integrity by keeping their word on something.
---
OMG everyone shut up about Death Blossoms, for the love of Vault-tec. This is Bethesda and they'll jump at the opportunity to nerf it instead of leaving it as an enjoyable quirk.
---
No, Ghostboy1225, this post was not a troll.  But rather a logical look at the direction of microtransactions and what I feel is the biggest issue with FO76, and that is inventory space.
---
I, me, I personally would pay 10/month to have access to the things I listed above.  That would make me give this company my money more than buying repair kits or just skins of weapons.
---
To each their own.
---
Scrapper and breaking down weapons (as well as Grafton Steel). I won't give away my routes though unless it's to a mod/Bethesda employee.
---
Go to the Charleston station, walk down the railway tracks to the second bridge. There's a guy there, Big Gazza, has huge hands and no neck. Possibly no head too, he'll be sure to give you some caps for doing...... something.
---
Honestly you will figure all this out as you play. Don't worry too much about an optimal build. Just make sure that you are keeping your damage up with the mobs you are fighting and fill the rest in as you go. Leveling is dead easy and you can fix any mistakes after you hit 50. 
---
You'll just have a much better time if you don't have to struggle with every mob you fight.
---
I'm redoing it and I realize that this advice is really valuable, so thank you very much for the help!
---
I disagree, everything I listed is not pay to win.  It is more of a Pay for QoL, if anything.
---
Pay to win is pay 5dollars and you do 50% more dmg and take 50% less dmg for 2 hours.  Buff is retained on death.  THAT is pay to win.
---
Everything that is listed here doesnt change the power level of max end toons at all.  It is all conveniences.  And again, that is NOT pay to win.
---
Thank you for sharing why.
---
That isnt a firm no -- you want NPCs added and then maybe this stuff.  Ill take it.
---
Man. Could you imagine dual wielding a couple of mole miner gauntlets.
---
Where at?
---
Curious, where do you get the recipe? From Biv or is it sold somewhere?
---
No.  Look at Heroes of the Storm's model.
---
Nothing in there is PAY TO WIN.   Look at ESO's -- again, nothing is PAY TO WIN.
---
You are the one who is wrong.   And since you are not offering any new information to change my mind, I am done replying to you.

Fixation with roaches aside, of course you get downvoted because this game is designed to play that way. In mmo like the old mud game (like everquest or other mmos) people do camp check (with chat msg) to see who is camping a certain zone or a mob to prevent this sort of aggroing problem. It is impossible to play this game like an mmo because Bethesda does not design this game with mmo mechanics. You just gotta adapt and be smarter to beat the game. If you cannot, there other games that offer better enjoyment in less stress environment.
---
If it could essentially be like Lincoln Logs that would please my inner child
---
Be aware that your suggestion would cause a shit storm that would be several times worse than the repair kit fiasco
---
on now
---
I think near Gualey Mine but you cant interact with it

As long as you're happy....

I'm done. I can see there's no point.

People without power armor die easily, provided they are hit with the right weapons. What is the exploit that multiplies power armor DR?
---
In a lot of areas your camera cant fit :(
---
I don't know about you but im not giving the items i spent my time and effort to get to some stranger for repairs. It's much better to repair them yourself and earn the atoms to get the plans less risk
---
There is so much this game fails to explain.
---
Remember when the loot wheel would just spin forever? I used to go back and check meat piles half an hour later to get my loot. Ha ha! Seriously though that sucked.
---
I hang out at that coffin in survival mode
---
Yes please!
---
I’m online now.
---
Glad Bethesda responded despite how upset this sub was over this.
---
“Communities sentiment”
---
It isn’t the communities sentiment. 
---
They shouldn’t comment or make commitments based on angry spam from a tiny percentage of the full community.
---
Can we not get p2w micro transactions, that would really fit the worlds vibe
---
I got it from Biv as a reward for one of the quests.
---
Or PA-only melee weapons like the street sign axes some super mutants used to have. Or maybe it was behemoths.
---
Different strokes for different folks I guess.
---
You're just a salty entitled neckbeard, man. I'm not sticking my head in the sand, I'm not in denial. I just believe that this is a very small issue and that Bethesda isnt some evil corporation for adding this item to the Atom Shop.  Call me crazy, but I have more pressing issues in my life, including my childs well being, the hundreds of things that go on at work every day, sick relatives, you know, 'real world issues' to  care that much about what a fucking game company does.
---
The thing that your head is seemingly to thick to absorb, is that this IS about a video game. It's not about milk or whatever idiot metaphor you tried to write there. It's not about a car company. Or a fortune 500 company.
---
It's about a VIDEO GAME company. They make digital content that people pay for. 
---
This is not the first, nor will it be the last time a game company promises something and changes course through development. Unfortunately things cost money. And if the game sales are dwindling they need to sell more shit to the dumb whales who will buy it. All the power to them. Who really cares in the end.
---
Bigger companies (try pharmaceutical types, the price of insulin etc)  lie about way bigger things every day that can actually result in life or death... this is about a video game going super slightly pay 2 win.  
---
I suggest you tone down your brainiac, holier than thou bullshit attitude.
---
 I'm blocking you because you talk like a dumbshit highschooler who doesnt know anything about life, FYI, not because I'm wrong. 
---
Have a nice day.
---
I do not care if some people dislike my idea.  I do not care if the majority of reddit posters dislike it.  For every one who complains and bitches about something online there are just as many people who like something but dont want to deal with the drama of mob-rule on a forum site.
---
But anyway, not a troll.  FO76 needs to make money, and instead of adding BS items like repair kits and fridge's, give something that is good and a good value.  I am sure lots of people would love to be able to swap their SPECIAL stats and perks while inside their CAMP.  Some people do not want to level more than 1 toon -- some people love leveling.  Options are never a bad things.  That is why PLUS is optional -- the people who do no pay, still reap the rewards of FO76 making money since they get new content that is released due to said capital.
---
I you just want to kill scorched go for scorched killer receiver at the fire station. If you want damage go with hardened
---
YES
---
you got a headset?
---
If it was something like us demanding something that had not been promised multiple times then I would agree with them.  But the very CORE of the game at the time of announcement, had Todd promising COSMETIC ONLY.  
---
This is clear it's not going that direction anymore, and the player base that is supporting them deserves to know what and why this is changing.
---
How can I help you?
---
i might go and put in a ticket i just had it freeze again and i wasn't even fighting a sbq. Luckily it came back after a minute
---
can you craft 2 T51b calibrated shocks for me?
---
Downvoted for an obvious factual statement. Love these self centered trolls.
---
VATS plus one tap from my Handmade sorts all types of molerat.
---
I’m looking for the most effective mod for the SBQ to throw on my legendaries that are furious or TSE
---
The 210 wasn't the toxic one.
---
Dropped at level 45 for my level 25 charactee.
---
Shitty repair kits are as much pay to win as a damn paint job. Get real.
---
Yeah something like that.
---
In survival mode rn chilling at bottom of Thunder Mountain Lake... so quiet down here... I see fish swimming...
---
When he wouldnt keep leaving me alone, and one shotting me with TSE. Yeah alright.
---
If you want to only grind SBQ and SB then go for Scorched killer because it’s like a non hardened prime receiver but normal damage and more scorch damage. If you want to more damage overall go for hardened.
---
Fascinating. Any backing data on this or is it just a personal theory?
---
I do have a headset, I’m talking, others can here me. You need to drop your power armor. Not place it. Then I’ll jump in it craft for you and drop it back.
---
I can piss farther than both of you.
---
That’s coming in a patch very soon. :) If you’re Pacifist, your CAMP is indestructible.
---
🤤🤤🤤🤤
---
&gt; It's about a VIDEO GAME company. 
---
You said it yourself. It's about a video game **COMPANY**, what you seem to understand but aren't admitting at this point is that it's not about the video game they make.
---
AS someone who has dropped a TSE Prime Gauss only to have it never be found I wholeheartedly endorse some kind of "locking" if items.
---
Dropping things from the PIPBoys is easy AND \*\*\*dangerous\*\*\*

The real wasteland would grill the air you breath and water you drink. It would vaporize your skin and you immediately turn into a human blob. After your meltdown your bones freeze to crystals and turn to ash.

for some reason you can't hear me and i can't hear you. your mike icon is Xed out
---
What was your experience with letting the 3* legendary super mutants refresh their health vs one-shot killing them? I’ve heard you have to let the health refill to get better odds of a 3* drop.
---
I’ve played the game since prerelease. No one I know gives a shit about repair kits. These doomsayers are strangely isolated to reddit and a couple streamers who bitch for viewers.
---
Point. Though you'd ad a lot to that unless you wrote a scrypt to auto log in after crashes etc.
---
Honestly, thats one of the biggest reasons I'm hesitant to buy any game that's not on steam. That 'hours played' data is useful for me.
---
You might be the stupidest person I've ever met.
---
Weird... anything else I can help you with
---
Is this confirmed list that works in game? I only ask not to discredit you, but so I don't invest in the wrong perk card first. :)
---
cool! sent invite, muleitor ign
---
Yes in my experience that’s 100% true. Multiple times when I one shot killed 3 stars and 2 stars they didn’t drop anything.
---
I don't seem to have a problem with crickets at all
---

The NukaWorld DLC in Fallout 4 was Raider Roleplay. The Pit DLC in Fallout 3 was Raider Roleplay. 
---
Any other raiders in Bethesda's Fallout games were pretty much mindless AI just put in place to be vapid douchebags and minor annoyances... wait, "Raider RP" makes so much sense now.
---
CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.  But I’m a girl so that might be hard.
---
Don't attack someone and complain about dying.
---
I use the miner gauntlet things it’s wicked fast.
---
 Yeah, swapping out lock picks and hard bargain would be a good idea.  I just didn't put a lot of thought into what to do with charisma and perception as I feel the most important perks are under strength, intelligence and luck. Your  suggestions sound good.   Calibrated shocks give extra carry weight so I can mostly avoid batteries included and carry about 10 fusion cores on me.   Finding them for T60 involves some RNG, but not that bad at all compared to most other armors. Eventually I save enough for calibrated shocks for T51.  I paid someone I found on reddit to make some shocks for ultracite power armor.  RNG for X01 shocks   is insanely ridiculous, though I eventually found them.  Found one shock on my main and the other on my alt.  And of course the excavator armor gives 100 extra carry weight.  You can get by with the level 45 excavator, but I recommend getting T60 with calibrated shocks as soon  as you get to level 50.
---
Well apparently i have the ability to do all the bos linings. Had no idea.
---
Yeah I think they might change it since they saw the community’s reaction though
---
Well, "created". I doubt they have any idea about crafting, really. More likely it's comparing against a snapshot from 30 days ago. If you haven't added a giant pile of stuff within the month then you're probably fine.
---
not now, thanks
---
Why not pick the body up and eat it like a giant chicken wing? 🤣
---
Did you read the captions? I said I wasn't attacking. I was sitting there trying to figure out my inventory and checking with the player vendor.
---
I'll swing by to not destroy your camp.  No sir,  no destruction on my mind at all... (Jimmy,  get the super sledge)
---
only alpha is decoded
---
Cool. Stop by anytime.
---
Ghoul whales or ghoul sharks. Radioactive jellyfish that can float on air.
---
WHOLESOME.
---
thanks, I will.
---
Repair kits will be UNLOCKED via the shop not added to the inventory but unlocked

---
Let me preface I love Bethesda, but they don’t seem to understand when to stop at this point, let’s hope they pull them
---
Are you on Xbox cuz if so I’m running low on ammo and I would not mind giving you quite a few caps for some
---
Love this.....
---
I never seem to have good luck here. I truthfully don't run it much so I'm not an expert at the layout of the building. I usually do the usual whitesprings and watoga runs since those do seem more fun. Thanks for the great post!
---
Welcome to fallout 76!!
---
They would just camp outside the damage zone lol
---
So you’re the boogie man?
---
Hopefully you got something good
---
It doesn't mean they're NOT banned lol
---
They would describe loot boxes as being unlocked as well. I dont think they will be an in game item.
---
Because you've written my friend attack so basically its your group that started it
---
Nah, nowhere is safe. 
---
I've had my camp on top of Seneca Rocks attacked multiple times. Not super successfully, but still. One time the attacked was the guy whose camp was on the other peak. 🙄
---
Did Tesla recently purchase Bethesda? O_o
---
You’re a raider? Haha
---
I think I post this once every 24 hours now. I've been copy/pasting this whenever I see someone make a post about cross character storage. I just like the idea and keep wanting to share it.
---
I'd like to see a main menu option for transferring items. A sort of cross-character stash. By doing it from the main menu it would also keep the extra items from needing to be loaded on the game servers, which seems to be an issue the game has and way stash limits we low at the  start. A way it could work is:
---
* Main Menu item for I.T.E.M.S Box (Inventory Transfer and Enhanced Management System)
---
* I.T.E.M.S opens up a menu with all items in it on the right and your currently selected character's S.T.A.S.H. on the left.
---
* From  here you can move inventory between STASH and ITEMS. Since it's not on a  game server, there's no worry about large quantities of items hurting  much.
---
* The  I.T.E.M.S. box would be tied to the player (not character) allowing all  your of your characters to share the same I.T.E.M.S. box inventory.
---
* There  would be no reason to limit what you could put here other than to try  and keep the illusion of scarcity in a post apocalyptic world so  hoarders could rejoice.
---
Base level 35 10mm TSE nominal damage would be 24\*1.25\*1.2 = 36. Five points of pistol damage perks and three points in Bloody Mess gets you 58.
---
I have a 670 bounty... seeing if anyone walks down here to visit
---
Something tells me this is why it's taking a while to patch in invincible camps - they have to build out the workarounds for exploits of it first.
---
don't forget the "why are none of my atom shop textures loading in?"  disable your mods
---
I mean, if it dissolves in your stomach it should logically dissolve in your butt right?
---
I don't really have all that much trouble with my CAMP, and it's been in the same spot for a little over, two months. But if you need supplies to rebuild (and are on xbox) let me know, I can help (free of charge)
---
Thanks for the confirmation. 
---
I had a hunters hunting rifle before too. Hilarious but vendor fodder.
---
+karma, got a plan :)  not sure if I own it in main, nice one anyway. thanks.
---
Instead of being that guy below, I will gladly share information. If you want a shit ton of steel, basically do uranium fever. Even during non-events, hit up that mine where it is located. I always walk out with 150 steel during non events and 300 plus steel during event. There is no better steel route then this scenario.
---
No problem at all
---
thanks a ton will definitely invest in those
---
Both the legendary weapon effect and the perk affect the Pip-Boy displayed damage, so I’d say yes, they almost certainly do. I haven’t tested the actual damage output, but I did discover a rather interesting related factoid- you can’t hurt someone in pacifist in Adventure mode. But Suppressor is still applied. 
---
I have a mule account. Listed damage on his shotgun is 81.
---
Shot with my main with a suppressor 50cal. Listed damage dropped to 65 damage. 
---
Added Suppressor perk. Shot again. Listed damage now showing 45.
---
hey, you still got the civil war reenactor?
---
Yes and I agree with your points. I don’t think the game will die with the intro of repair kits at all, it’ll probably have no effect on our game play.
---
My issue is that a promise was broken to all of us, to just let it slide like nbd doesn’t sit right with me. It’s not like I’ll never buy a Beth game again.. but I definitely won’t take them at their word in the future.
---
Yes sir
---
One of about 5 or six weapons that could use a buff! Lol at least you can get ammo.
---
I think AWOL is the best. Lvl 50 over Lvl 40 is nice
---
Meow Nibba
---
I thought they did fix that. I haven't seen it in a while. Maybe I'm lucky!
---
Great i'm coming on now i'll add you :)
---
Can we pls stop using the Ingame Name of a Enemy NPC Faction of a Franchise to explain the behavior of Game Mechanic Abuser, Glitcher, Cheaters and childish Trolls and just call that people what they actually are. I'm playing raider characters and never have done that evil things Pacifist don't like. I'm kinda offended right now.
---
Get a vamps pipe rifle and get ur shots in before they can kill them... too many times people have no thought for this
---
I fucking loathe your outlook on this. It's a symptom of what's wrong with the industry as a whole. You're shaping this as not only _acceptable_ but _normal_ and neither of those things are true. 
---
yes, atom shop purchases are the only source of revenue for this game. That doesn't make going back on your word acceptable, or something we should fucking reward.
---
I keep missing you by like half an hour. If you're still around send me a message and I'll hop on and toss that crossbow to you. I'll be up for another two hours
---
This was my favorite thing to do in Tactics. Two units aim for left legs, two units aim for right, and one crazy idiot throwing rocks to lure the Deathclaws.
---
If it makes you feel any better, there is a very high likelihood that he was hunted down by the guy in the power armor and killed, rather easily. I usually one shot anyone under 75 or so and this dude was probably dealt with by another player. Wanted tags are much more rare in adventure these days and I'd be happy to see one. 
---
I will quote Mr. Deeds about your attacker: "As I suspected, he was both a weakling and a coward."
---
I liked what someone had posted before in different thread about Wastelanders being 100 years after reclamation day. So all the vault dwellers and survivors are added in, along with factions and the scorched are gone.
---
I can see all the complaint posts now:  
---
"Canvas bag skin in Atom Shop looks like nylon in game"
---
I thought I got lucky 😥
---
i've got an instigator, but furious would be nice
---
Near Tyler county race track. There is a quarry/pond. Beautiful area. That whole region. 
---
Also I grew up going to races at the Tyler county track. Could be the nostalgia tugging my heart strings.
---
They will probably even put them on sale before adding items to the store. Drop them down to 10 atoms everyone goes wild and buys as many as they can. Bing bang boom now add something that people want and youve hit pay dirt. Sorry you gotta hear it from me. Hope im not right tbh.
---
This post needs more attention. Read it.
---
I’d like to beat some scorched down with a yield sign...
---
Bloodied users go down in one shot in PvP. Its very risky but very rewarding to see enemies straight ragdoll though. I respect those who walk that line. Its just not for me
---
Hey man, keep it down, some of us are trying to stockpile.
---
Id kiss everyone at bethesda studios if they added the Jersey Devil, just think, its like, &lt;New event: From the Green state&gt; and you have to go to the corner of the Mire and watch as hordes of them fly in, and if you fail they will attack you from the air at random throughout the map
---
Of course its the Russians
---
Welcome to the downfall of Western civilization.
---
So you would rather let people pay to get ahead. Just what this game needs, more controversy and problems. With everything that has happened to this game, p2w like you are advocating for will destroy it.
---
Hey man, I can see that you’re passionate about this issue. It can be frustrating that so many people think they’re representing you when they don’t. 
---
You’re right, reddit doesn’t represent the whole community. I will say though that there definitely isn’t an “equal number of posts” since the mods are deleting posts and regulating all similar discussion to a mega thread. But your point is still there- reddit doesn’t represent the whole community only a part of it.
---
Having said that, Bethesda should give an official statement. **Even if there wasn’t a single reddit post about it,** Bethesda still went back on a day 1 promise that was made in interviews, documentaries, on twitter, and during E3 and that alone warrants an explanation.
---
You aren't replying to anyone here, you're making new comments.
---
You forgot "Where are the personal stores, they said I'd be able to sell stuff?"
---
Exactly,  you,  your friend,  doesn't matter in this game.  Take it up with your buddy that bit off more than he could chew.
---
Damn that tells you how old I am
---
I recently started carrying a suppressors explosive handmade on me for thse types of events and white springs.  I don't know if the suppressor effect helps the melee crew at all, but it tones down my damage considerably while letting me tag everything quickly.
---
PC.
---
good stuff.
---
yeh i was trading the other day on market and sold a couple of things to this guy.
---
he had tse minigun and bought it off him for 3k was sooooooooo happy normally selling for 10k or so :)&gt;
---
It shoots two grenades. They land at separate times. So the damage it shows is correct for one Grenada.  I have this gun as well.
---
I always signal when I find the legendary. But yeah, some unit with a TSE almost always shows up and there's almost no reason to keep playing due to said unit bogarting the 3 stars. Don't see them fixing the drills though, but they're right there when the terminated management announcement comes on.
---
Yes, it wasn't an overpowered monster in 4 BUT LOOK AT THAT DESIGN. The weapon guys went hog wild on that shit. The original was a cool homage to 70s sci fi B movies, Hub's blaster is fucking DANK. Who cares if it wasn't practical, the Shishkebab hasn't been useful since FO4 and it's still useful because it's fucking awesome.
---
Would be awesome.. Maybe stronger then the metal walls but flammable?
---
That 2-step (#1 above) happens to me at Whitespring bunker and Whitespring main entrance all the time.
---
\+karma Thank you :)
---
When I was a lower level I know I've had some 2 and 3 star items but never knew to inspect it. I was like level 40 or 50 when I figured it out so I'm sure I didn't lose anything too good (at least for level 45 and 50 items) but there should still be a pop up when you get a legendary item to inspect it if it has more than one star
---
Yep, [It's listed here](https://youtu.be/ET8I8zTAnTw). Extra locations included too.
---
Never worked in any game. Beth never played such games before i guess. Probably just Pen n Papers.
---
 Both of these are loading issues.  
---
First one you move before the area finishes loading and it puts you back at the start once it finishes.
---
Second one the enemy is actually dead but the game loads it up initially as a placeholder before the server checks and says “nope, should be dead” and it drops dead.
---
no one will want this mate,
---
dont think that in a few months people will be like oh i need to have medical mal as its a named legendary which will take up stash space woooo lol.
---
it is and always will be worth 100 caps
---
True in every industry unfortunately. Did the management thing once. The lay a d perks were great, but couldn't stomach the company, behavior, or (lack of) "belief system". "Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach" (manage more likely..)
---
Yeah I actually managed to find it and the bar first, wandering around looking for the damn concourse. I was like "This is the place people are raving about?"
---
My personal score is 10 . For a little while when they were balancing numbers on fusion cores it would have been an 8 but I'm happy with it now
---
For me it's a 10 because I love exploring. Its huge. The limited stash size forces me to actually get up and do something with my hoarder collection and the fact that you have to scrap weapons for mods and that it's so easy to craft ammo gives me something to do with said horde. 
---
I love looking around the sites to see what happened to the people. In some locations you find ghouls where people survived the bombs and not time. Scrotched where they survived time but not the infestation and bones where they survived neither.
---
I can see it getting a lower score if your just in a mad rush to the end of the main story that's not what the game was made for
---
Ha! Nah no worries, I don't use the official reddit app but I remember there being confusion about this from that app and I see this kind of thing a lot.
---
How old are you, out of curiosity?
---
I find most people are cool.  I try to do the "come here" emote  if I find the legendary first.  Sometimes there are douches,  but everyone knows what everyone else is there for and for the most part have been cool.  Who knows,  maybe the awesome legendary someone finds because of cooperation will end up in your hands through trading one day?
---
You hit him lmao he’s not the toxic one
---
&gt;Big Gazza
---
Lol take him down in Grafton. Finishing the quest and looting him would nets you caps twice.
---
Hmm sounds nice I’ll check it out
---
It's more like just irradiated water. And if it's an alien blaster, I'm sure it's designed to withstand a really good beating of anything since is superior and advanced technology
---
What is the current limit
---
Yeah. I apologize, I’m just incredibly tired of this. The exact same topic spam tactic was used at launch. The exact same statements, the exact same bot downvoting. Nothing has changed from these trolls. Instead of legit constructive criticism after we’ve had a chance to see if this change even actually does anything we get a group of trolls demanding their way and spamming anyone who disagrees off the sub.
---
The mods are on your side, by the way. They leave posts up for 24hr even if they’re purely an obvious karma farm. The mods on this sub PARTICIPATED in the spam at launch.
---
Lol one can only hope anyways
---
I believe the thinking is that only people running cap stash exploits or buying caps from websites (lmao) would ever have that much money. The most I've ever had at once was the necessary 9600 to get the Signs &amp; Letters plan.
---
I just found a sweet 2 star surpressors explosive combat rifle today!! It's only level 40 but it's a beauty!! I always check all the dropped stuff I see!
---
I was expecting more of a “We’ll have more on this Thursday” or “We will be making an official statement soon, stay tuned”
---
But so far it’s seems they’ve been instructed not to engage us about it for the time being. Which is understandable, I’m not mad about it, they may just be trying to figure out what to say/do without making us explode the sub with complaint posts again.
---
1. is a rubberband bug that happens on server side bgs needs to patch in more stability.
---
2. is not a bug but the fact that someone was there recently before you and the game goes hey the queen is alive oh wait she just got killed by someone else 5 mins ago so she just flops dead.
---
happens a lot with enemy's all over Appalachia
---
Who knows. Theres always someone who hasn't played the game yet that might want it for a vats crit build. Thankfully with alts,  it won't really matter either way
---
Respawns. If life had respawns no one would play games but the world would look like Fallout haha.
---
Samurai Jack is undoubtedly one of the best toons ever.
---
I know it. Sometimes trading in game is great and other times they try to gouge you for every cap
---
Events need a HUGE revamp. Except the SBQ, every quest is only made for a maxium of 4 players.
---
\- Legendarys should directly wander in your inventory once its owner got killed, like you get em after a event or a quest.
---
\- Every Player can loot all corpses inside the event, exactly like it works if you where in a team.
---
Mechanics are already implemented, they literaly just need to copy paste the script lines and fit them to events.
---
24 players
---
Yep this would be alot better than putting stuff in a container at a train station and switching characters
---
Actually 35
---
I’ve been saying this myself.
---
I'm pretty sure I have gotten 3 since B.E.T.A.
---
True, it was certainly one sided, but I’m biased I guess since I do agree with that side, so I haven’t noticed it as much. 
---
I can’t even imagine what a cesspool YouTube must be right now about it..
---
No probs
---
Are you sure?
---
Yep
---
Cultist Dagger or Sacrificial Machete
---
Name saved for further research, thanks.
---
I think 8pm uct is 3pm CST for me. 
---
I'd be down to tag along. Me and this dude can def help. We've done quite a few launches.  I'll even use my nuke card.
---
They aren't craftable, correct?
---
Source?
---
Yeah because its 0% realistic
---
Oh, actually you are kinda right, there is 24-30 players Max on one server
---
That could be cool but I think every high level base would just be a big box of in flammablewalls and turrets
---
You gotta post a video!
---
https://gamerant.com/fallout-76-player-count/
---
Here it says 24-32 players
---
So I can fill a server with half my friends list?
---
You could FT to another location. I don't PVP and from what I read on here probably won't be for a while. Maybe never.
---
Highest kills should put you on the map.
---
So serial killers go on the map survivor should have another incentive.
---
That's why it need to be changed
---
Victory is assured.  Unless you've got some kind of hyper- funnel or something lol
---
Bluntly, beyond setting what is acceptable policy regarding posts on this issue, the input of reddit moderators who are in no way associated with bethesda as a company is...useless.
---
Never mind then :-)

Pc- games keeps crashing at login - Mods and .jni files
---
It cant be 35. You cant divide that by 4. 4 Players per team. Right now its still 24 Players.
---
When is tomorrow's downtime?
---
Will do—expect it around 4 PM EST tomorrow
---
Ok, so I recently got the thirst zapper as a random drop. The mods are all unlocked on the weapons workbench. I keep searching online to see if anyone else has found one, but no dice. I just keep thinking that the drop rate must be CRAZY low. Just know that it is possible, so it likely will never get to the atom shop.
---
Yep I  made a mistake sorry
---
OK IM OUT
---
That's before the game came out, and they said in the no clip documentary that there may be either 24 or 32 players but they hadn't decided on the cap yep. Later saying it was 24. That's a bad source.
---
Indeed - most of the time the "stutter" seems to be server pausing, I.e. the enemies don't suddenly skip ahead when the game resumes. So it's like the server is overloaded. I recall some people theorising that it's because of people trying to exploit, but who knows.
---
I don’t think this is necessary and probably can’t/shouldn’t happen due to their servers. 
---
I believe it’s currently limited to 24. 
---
A game similar in function is GTAO, which is a behemoth but they know what they’re doing. Their servers max at 30 (plus 2 non-player spectators), and are much more stable than FO76, which is understandable considering the online version of that game is almost 6 years old. Despite that, FO76’s auto save function is actually more stable than Rockstar’s. R*’s auto save is so rough it’s constantly used as an exploit to cheat in the game. 
---
Anyway, back to Fallout. I think it is realistic to push the servers to 30, but considering the engine and server stability, I don’t think 50 is attainable without some major surgery to the back end of the game. 
---
Now I’m on Xbox. I’ve NEVER been told a World is full unless I was choosing to join a specific one. If I just agree to jump in the game, I’ve never had to wait. I can’t speak to the other two platforms though. 
---
Because the map is so gargantuan, adding more players might alleviate the concerns of those that say the world is empty and they never see other players. 
---
Perhaps those that say these things are exploring in parts of the map that I rarely frequent, but I see other players so frequently that I sometimes wish there were less players allowed in each server. 
---
But then again, I Farm a lot so I tend to frequent more populated areas.
---
If something is important you make time duuuh
---
I mean it is still not enough for the map that big, they can definitely increase Max player cap.
---
For me, it's been the Uranium Fever event, farm Whitesprings and farm West Tek and the 2 satellite dish areas near there, then server hop. It's been slow but steady for me (lvl 121).
---
Having said that, I have no doubt there are better ways. This is just what works for me and my play style.
---
I mean I guess. In my Survival games, I think I'm the boogeyman. Most of the time it's a bunch of dudes fighting amongst themselves in the Whitesprings area. If you're out and about, quietly doing your business, odds are you won't run into anyone. 
---
That's where I come in. I don't chase after bounties. A lot of trolly players like to get a small bounty and then sit at the top of a mountain with their C.A.M.P. blocking all entrances so they can snipe people. But I mean...like seriously you're just waiting most of your game time to maybe snipe people. 
---
Me, Survival is where I live. I sell my caps in Survival, I get resources in Survival. I'm close to a four hour timer iirc. But what separates me from the others is my willingness to stalk and assassinate players. It's actually rather difficult to find someone just randomly in the map and I'd never camp railroads like some wangs do. 
---
No, I look for more subtle clues like events popping up (sometimes events appear in response to players entering their effective area), recently killed enemies, loot bags that did not have an accompanying '___ killed ____' message. When I find evidence of activity I approach tree to tree, bush to bush. It's best to catch someone mid fight, their attention is focused in front of them, not behind them. Depending on the distance, I'll use an AA Gauss but I'd prefer claws. Players expecting PvP typically carry very little or straight up nothing on them. Players not expecting a fight have all kinds of treats on them. 
---
So I guess it's a little less like hide and seek and more like seek and destroy to me.
---
The creature variety in FO76 is actually really good IMO it's just kind of hidden. Trash mobs are common but there are Behemoths, Grafton Monsters, Deathclaws, Mirelurk Queens, and plenty of other rare monster types that are more normal sized. They're just hard to come by compared to the typical mobs. 
---
I agree though, huge monster variants would add a lot to this game. It'd be cool if they were random spawns too, so you'd never know when you'd run into one.
---
Oh I agree, just pointing out you might want to research a bit.
---
Would you say you get about a level every 2-3 hours?
---
Hello can you hear me?
---
I believe they have issues with the servers being able to handle that much stuff. Especially if a large number of them join a SBQ fight. They're limiting what we can carry and stash. The latest increase in those limits has shown in game lag.
---
Ive yet to meet a "Raider" in this game who wasn't just some entitled sociopath who gets off on being a asshole to people who can't/won't fight back. It's pathetic.
---
Step 1: Nuke Whitesprings
---
Step 2: Farm Glowing Ones
---
Step 3: Repeat steps 1 and 2 in order forever
---
Also how do I change my flair i can’t change it :/
---
The fact that you were there was probably an attraction.
---
In-game flair?
---
No like by your name
---
I assume they will add factions with this one. And Npcs from every other region begin to settle down into West Virginia. New Random Enemy Human Encounters in every Spot(Human Raider Gangs, Gunners, Chilrden of the Atoms etc) Some more trading Caravans. And i hope citys full of people, or atleast we can do that. Some quests you can decide the future of your character that actually have some impact and are not reversable and close other paths for good.
---
Thats my hope. :x A tiny change that makes War never Change again.
---
It's also still impossible to find ghoul golfers.
---
Given the fact that 99.9999% of all 3\* loot is useless trash anyway...
---
They need to undo all the "fixes" they've made to legendary loot. Max level enemies can drop actual max level gear, not held down to 35-40, 3\* enemies drop 3\* loot, because this system is \_bullshit\_ as it stands now.  
---
It's a long, sad grind for \_garbage\_
---
The Whitesprings thing has been happening since they increased stash and camp size.
---
For sure a level a day. In hours though...I couldn't tell you. I don't keep track that hardcore. I'm a "when it happens, it happens" kinda person, you know?
---
If I was to hazard a guess, I'd say that it's not out of the realm of possibility but it will get tougher the higher you go.
---
Oh, so you need to go to the main subreddit page, and you need to click those three dots on the upper right corner one it will say change flair, and you can change it, and least I have it like that on my phone app
---
Ur just getting unlucky, and vats crits arent like fallout 4 when it would always hit
---
yeah, I sadly didn't get the one from 76 apparently. the challenge for collecting all the tapes unlocked though to further add to the weirdness of it all.
---
You can join a world and look at the playerlist.
---
In case this is why you're asking, you can acquire that plan whenever you have the Caps.  It's not randomized or level-locked anymore.
---
buy recipe at camden park vendor bot thats what I did.
---
Ya, it's wood tho. I like leveling but high levels defiantly need something more. The cheaters need their toons wiped. I'm 230 and usually a cool person to meet unless you're being rude. Hell level 50's with great and weapons and gear can kill any level.. I hate that. Especially in the PVP servers they lose way less caps and can one shot us.. I took my time to level and these guys either use their higher characters to gear or buy it. Pretty lame. I don't give up tho and keep trying.
---
You can farm more than that after a run through Westek, killing all super mutants and scrapping their weapons with the Scrapper perk equipped, I've come out with somewhere around 700-900 steel after a Westek run. Also, there's a bunch of Iron ore that can be mined using the Excavator armor at Hornwright Testing Site #3. After smelting the ore you can come out with 500+ steel.
---
Dude!  Don’t be so negative.  By the way,  I played overburdened for all my levels before quitting this poopy game at level 70 or something.    ;-)
---
Only issue is im stuck on the main story part before nukes because my character is useless. That's why im leveling. To respec.
---
No you can't. You can look at a list of recent players. We tested it by switching servers and having friends hop off line and it still showing that they are on my server under the recent tab.
---
Did it work for you ?
---
Only 1 at a time counts unfortunately
---
Better than Mojang.
---
They are still working on tickets from 10th March 2019....
---
Not to mention every time I kill a legendary I only get shitty melee weapons(except you Grognak axe love you) or decent pieces of Armor haven’t seen a single legendary gun and im almost level 100
---
No, Unyielding Chameleon can't exist because both of those are primary effects.  Sentinel and Cavalier are secondary effects (and not always noted in the name of the item).
---
It only drops lvl40 which is pretty lame. Definitely not the best event.
---
Can’t argue that lol I’ll always love the Shishkebab just because it’s so damn cool
---
Umm so u want the game to constantly crash? Great suggestion!!
---
I mean the Enclave Strategy works well, let’s just pollute the Ohio River, The Potomac River, and all other sources of water and fill them with FEV
---
Sequel to Bioshock
---
He's talking about the rubber band effect at Whitesprings bunker also. You enter and run to the end of the decontamination chamber and the game snaps you back to the door where you started. The thing with sudden death may be related.
---
Vertibot
---
Yes thank you
---
You can server hop the Whitesprings Clubhouse then.  Even not in a Nuke Zone it can net you quite a bit of experience very quickly.
---
I met an authentic raider once. Was in game chat, I was at my work bench and he aims a handmade at me and demands my chems. Played along. Was funny. I forget his name but if you're our there raider dude, thanks for the experience
---
Yep, I feel the same way, wrote up a post about the missing element from Adventure Mode: danger. Unless you chose to PVP, take workshops you were never really in any danger. In Survival, you literally are never safe. I sell my caps in Survival (not advisable for the saltier players) and I actively hunt other players in Survival. I don't mean like I run to Whitesprings for rando battles or camp railroads, I mean I'll track a motherfucker for fifteen minutes back to his C.A.M.P. and slit his throat when he's rummaging through his stash. That kind of crazy shit is not possible in Adventure. Last dude I assassinated was like level 340, I heard his stealth field clicking on and off before he heard mine or maybe he wasn't listening for it. He wandered right into my trap and not unlike a spider waiting for a fly he walked almost right up to me before I jumped him. One shot, clean kill, decent aid items. Absolutely no one is safe and it's fucking fantastic.
---
Ooo! And a roof garden would really piss off Scorchbeast too! Make it easier to farm then, with your C.A.M.P. in the right spot.
---
I'm level 143, and I still get a level or two every day I play. That's maybe 3-8 hours per.
---
Nice
---
But you mean the FO American flag, correct?
---
The kinda stilted language they use, it’s possible they could have the VA say like the 5000 most common words or something and give custom (if limited) dialogue. 
---
Now would they do that? Probably not, but it’s fun to dream.
---
Wow this is so cool!
---
Can verify, had 17 on me, took all of them and only gave me the rewards for 1. No clue why...now when I get one during exploration, I go and turn it in by itself.
---
If you have two you’ll get a bit more caps but three won’t boost it further
---
...you still got that bloodied plasma?
---
Maybe with each prestige you get a full special and perk reset
---
Power Armor has a hidden rad resistance perk that you can't acquire through any feasible amount of non-PA rad resistance.
---
Maxson spoke, we obey. The entire point of the Brotherhood is preserving what was best and not repeating the mistakes of the past. Using the bombs is literally that. I'm 130 something and I've never launched a nuke. The Sierra Bravos can be put down with bullets, and we have plenty of bullets. Paladin Taggerdy, rest her soul, was one woman leading a small team. With 76 opening and many men and women heeding the BoS call, I'm confident we can beat them without another nuke.
---
Yeah my friend who love pvp caused me to get killed during fasnacht
---
What happens when you hit max though?
---
There was an issue with two shot gauss weapons and vats missing every time on the first shot but that was supposed to be corrected a patch or two ago
---
I just want another lvl 25 drill from a 3*.
---
Respectfully, I’ll make my case: 
---
300% more stash space means “Plus” players have 3X the amount of gear to choose from. They can store multiple armor sets, multiple weapons and significantly more aid items. They don’t have to make balanced choices like those with limited stash space would. 
---
More vendor caps for subscribers means they will be able to amass more money than others and buy the best weapons and armor, which will be priced out of reach of those who aren’t subscribers. 
---
More cap capacity goes hand in hand with the last item. We already see the market ceiling at just below the max cap level for 5 characters. If “Plus” members have more cap space, that ceiling will go even higher, effectively making it impossible for non members to acquire the best gear—which is predominantly PvP gear. 
---
While that doesn’t exactly equate to Bethesda selling the best weapons for money, it amounts to the same thing. Pay to subscribe and you can get the best gear, don’t, and you can’t. 
---
Your idea is a good concept, but it would need some ironing out to account for the externalities of an open, multiplayer world. We would also need to trust Bethesda not to tweak the mechanics to make it difficult to play without those QoL benefits, which I’m not sure anybody should do with any developer.
---
...I don't buy this. Where's this data from?
---
the very problem of the game is that even if you were higher level it's still pointless to fight back. they lose nothing If you kill them (a few caps sure, but if they dump all their caps first they get off no problem) and they can just respawn at your feet and keep at it.
---
“(Technically anything connected from that switch will also be powered. Some people connect rad showers, sirens, or lights as a notification someone opened the door. It will be turned off when the door closes)”
---
Where the hell was this info?! Thank you; game changer.
---
I get what you're saying.  It feels like there should be a small grace period, maybe just an hour or two, where both old and new codes would be accepted.
---
Bravo!
---
It's all good.  Even if you got 3\* loot, it'd likely be a leather armor piece or a pipe wrench
---
Caps?
---
Yea, but I don't go there unless I want Legendaries because as a melee build it's overwhelming to deal with all of them shooting you at once. Mole Miners are much easier to kill and the place is right near whitesprings station so you can quickly get out and do a run to the vendors or stash box.
---
Except irl youd die
---
Before you join the Brotherhood, they show a total number of docs. After you join, they stack into one and so showing the total. 
---
This is how you know how many you have. 
---
One Doc = 22 caps and lower loot chances
---
Two Docs = 40 caps and better loot chances
---
Always drop off with two when you join the Brotherhood. Turning in more than that doesn't benefit you at all.
---
It's still pretty good.  3 chances back to back at the 2nd highest level tier.
---
I had to either aim at a different body part or exit vats and kill stuff manually. I believe there's more involved than luck.
---
might have one ill have to check. how much you willing to pay :).?
---
That’s the 2Cnd 1 star Bloodied plasma rifle ive had drop for me in a week I sold the first one. I’ll be keeping this one until I find a three star for sale . I only know of 1 guy selling and he wants 35k for it so I’ll make due with this 4 a while.
---
Try manually changing your chat mode to area or join to a team with them and manually change to team chat. Also, if you can't hear them try using the social menu to mute and un-mute them.
---
Omg u had to kill it manually
---
What the f is technical data for anyway im level 40 and i dont believe i have ever used it
---
Read until the end  Did not disappoint.
---
I really don't like that aspect, and I heard of a guy who did it like 300 and i can only imagine the cost of the fast travels
---
Damn
---
It's probably the best all around *mid tier armor* in the game. The heavy variants of the others protect more, and also coincidentally weigh more. It's a weight vs protection gamble that very few people seem to take into account, except the design team didn't. If you wear heavier armor it'll burn your sprinting stamina faster and weigh more, that deal has been in place since Skyrim. 
---
Where Marine particularly shines imo is not just Ultralight but Weightless Ultralight. Weightless Ultralight Marine pieces weigh literally 0. It's the ultimate sneaking suit. I only have three pieces and I've been playing the game for hundreds of hours to complete the set. Once I've got it I effectively have a decent set of protective armor that I can Chameleon in, sneak around as if I were nude and gain some radiation protection from. 
---
I do agree it needs a buff but it has its uses.
---
baaaaaaaah baaaaaaaaah is the only thing you hear tomorrow night. As you turn around it's already too late. You got some huge horns in your ass. baaah baaah
---
Oh, weird. I've always just done it in bulk
---
I think you can only fabricate the veil once. Your best bet is if someone sells you one.
---
This is false. Please see my post.
---
Ah, was not aware that 2 got u more stuff. Will have to keep that in mind now. Ty!
---
If I knew beforehand,  I would have handed all of them to a friend that hadn't done the BOS line yet, and have them feed me tech data one by one.
---
It's face reminds me of the mama bear from Metro
---
That sounds pretty sick tbh. Do you know what would happen if you smoked that ash?
---
Brotherhood of Steel side quest.
---
You would still need to make it through the grid.. So not sure how you would get in there even with someone with you. Curious to see how you can get a new one. I accidentally scrapped my voice of set from this mission and had no option to make another one when I went to riverside manor today?
---
Was it the first Fallout where you had to get a ship running? Something like that, it's been way too long since I played that like 20+ years.
---
Really? This changes everything.
---
I just got to fort defiance too thats creepy
---
Yes caps, 1 tech data I think gives you 25 and 2 gets you 40
---
It's been verified through datamining to confirm the drop/loot. Its how I farmed all the paints quickly.
---
Can you show proof?
---
Depending on it’s perks
---
Yeah, I've heard the same and not a fan either. But if u want those elusive BoS skins, that's the place for it. And some unique outfits too I think...
---
Wait did the vendors in the white spring get delayed? I didn’t see that in the post.
---
Just looking at this from Bethesda’s perspective. We hear a lot about the engine Bethesda uses for their games being bad. The thing is that this is a fantastic engine but poorly optimized. 
---
With the strategy behind Fallout 76 I see this as a test in what their engine can do and reuse that data for valuable information moving into Elder Scrolls 6 and Starfield. Both will be using the same engine as Fallout 76 and from what I'm assumming from projected release dates its going to be massive. 
---
Fallout 76 has just gotten better and better since release, and I think this is reflective of their optimization process. 
---
Bethesda had always been ambitious and glitchy but they always follow through with the fans. Here’s one of my favorite Youtubers who dives into this engine and its potential. https://youtu.be/UpyHKCo1Odo 
---
Summary 
---
Bethesda rushed Fallout 76 to meet due dates and is poorly optimized. Things will only go up from here and for the future of Bethesda games.
---
you can get around 3 - 5k for it.
---
i got offered 3500 for my 3\* gamma gun the otherday
---
Watch the Movie 'How High' :D
---
U turn them in to the small red box on the wall in the Quartermaster's cabin in the basement.
---
Usual time maybe? Not sure. Seems like they always start around 10AM my time, and it becomes available to play like 2 or 3 hours later.
---
I saw one of those having no idea what they were for a couple weeks into the game and assumed they'd be places to build your own bot. I'm still hoping &gt;_&lt;
---
If that thing has a cool death animation when it kills you like if it bit your face off, I would probably just quit, because f that crap.
---
Not sure what that is
---
Is the game back up yet?
---
Ive not gotten that far into it yet just made it into the door before I had other things todo but im going to see what its all about tomorrow
---
hahaha bro your late to the party no player vending until May now. :)
---
It's called Survival mode...
---
They should show the highest kills guy as well though.
---
They covered it many times in this subreddit's Discord. Your proof is in the turn ins. 22 caps for one, 40 caps for 2+
---
Lately some of my VATS attacks won't strike even at 95%, until I exit VATS and retarget the enemy. I only noticed it after the latest patch, but others have said it's been ongoing.
---
Or if it's opposite a deathclaw and being in power armor makes it rage and charge you or something for a one hit kill. So even your safety blanket doesn't help you...
---
You get the same results for 2 as you would for 200, unfortunately.
---
I will try that, thank you.
---
Cool,  I'll have to start collecting them again. Thx
---
iirc they can track that kind of thing. One of the fishy parts about the ultracite ammo was the relative rarity of ultracite itself - you could only get so much of it whereas steel and gunpowder and lead can be farmed in ludicrous amounts in plenty of places. 
---
I think you'll be safe. Even if you're flagged I'm sure you'll get the chance to prove you're legit.
---
The only downsides are that 1) if they break em, it takes a lot of copper/glass (I think) to repair, which some might be low on, and 2) use em too much and you have to store, put down again and rewire everything, or repair once they break.
---
Info was provided my people smarter than I over on this subreddit's Discord channel. Lol
---
I never said my idea is set in stone, it is just an idea -- so I want to thank you for your feedback.
---
I will concede to you about the cap thing.  Take the cap thing out and I still think overall it is a good idea, especially the SPECIAL/Perk swap thing in camp.  
---
Thank you again for your feedback and not just crying and stomping your feet like most.
---
Np. I'd rather inform than to see them wasted. :)
---
It is not pay to win.  But keep on saying it is.
---
Boost your intelligence and kill stuff you will get a lvl/hour easily. Use unyielding armour, shielded casual outfit, broiled sb brain, berry mentats, make yourself cranberry relish and if you play on team use inspirational, don't forget to sleep once per hour ;) hope it helps. During double exp event i was able to get a lvl every white spring run on ghouls what's meant lvl per less then 10 minutes
---
The blood bugs and the giant ticks freak me the fuck out man. I had a blood orgy with 6 diseased blood bugs earlier today, came out alive but got a lot of stings. Every time one lunges and hits me I cringe to my core.
---
How about now? \*grin\*
---
Not worth the time 😬
---
Lol this is why no one will put high end items in vending machines! Good items are worth as much as you can get! It will be good for items that that are overflow ammo chems and comment legendary.
---
Clown Daddy
---
Do you have voice chat turned on.
---
does the secret door in the manor have grids as well? I don't recall mostly used the palaski entrance after my first time in.
---
Anyone know how long it will be down?
---
dang.
---
reduce, reuse, recycle. if i have surplus scrap i craft nublets some ammo. if not i give them some plans i already know
---
&gt;!except for when it comes to depleted fusion cores, dump those suckers into a fissure site!&lt;
---
I feel this way all day every day
---
I believe so
---
It is from different independent players that collected data over weeks of farming legendaries. I am at work right now, so I don't have my reddit-bookmarks here, but I will try to post you some links later. All of them came up with similar data though, even detecting a bug in the loot table that was later fixed, so apparently the data was somewhat correct.
---
8min?
---
Holy shit, I really need to
---
Take care of that infection man. Hope you feel better soon.
---
Bro did you just make an ICarly referance? I live you no homo tho.
---
Lol every camp will be marked
---
Why is the drill thing possible?
---
Alright mate, Don't give the Brotherhood any ideas..
---
Real Money Trading. He advertises a site which sells caps/items for real money.
---
I drop, trade, sell stuff for nothing all the time and help low levels grind for legendaries and xp especially during survival 2x xp weekend. Kinda act like a body guard to that  bonus xp cause survival is a shoot first ask questions later kinda place
---
I had assumed you can’t actually get the damned thing, thought people on reddit were just trolling.
---
Hell ya!
---
I'm having the same thing happen regularly with two different sniper rifles -- one regular and one legendary.
---
Nah. I think there should be maybe another ammo spot and perhaps another packaged food factory (hate clearing that giant place) but changing nodes to anything would throw things out of whack. Otherwise why not just always take the one closest to your base?
---
Here are some currently in game:
---
Mirelurk Queen, Behemoth, Hermit Crab, Scorchbeast, Grafton Monster, Mega sloth and Fog crawler.
---
Here are some that I would love to see:
---
Giant Honey Beast, Gatorclaw, Nukalurk queen (along with nukalurks), Giant rad scorpion, giant angler, and maybe a big robot boss like liberty prime.
---
I'm hoping they have different vending machines for different items like in the trailer. It would be cool if my camp was marked with a gun,medic x or a bullet.
---
I personally enjoy the south, just west of Watoga. Plenty of hills/mountains and alot of unmarked water. There's a nice pond near some cliffs that usually doesn't spawn many enemies
---
When I first started last week. Not far outside of the vault was a guy who was level 55 and he gave me quite a bit of stuff. Was very thankful for it.
---
As a long time gamers I remember the Lan days, 10-20 guys packed into a room playing BF2. Over weeks of random players joining in we never had one, single incident of griefing. There was the usual smart arse comments thrown around but it was all in good fun, no one took it serious. Why wasnt there any griefing?? Simple, no one was anonymous. You griefed or acted like these online asshats now a days at a LAN party and it ended up outside or a smack up the side of the head.
---
So to answer your question, they are cowards, bullies because of anonymity. If they actual had to face their victims they would piss their pants and back down.
---
It's just a fast travel to black reach, the dragon is now a SBQ.
---
I always make sure to deposit my known plans at the overseer's stache!
---
Bethesda: Get fucked and keep beta testing our game.
---
The BoSS *Montana*? "We remember your mortars, General."
---
Perfectly preserved as all things should be.
---
If  your're just needing one made, give me specs and I'll build you one.
---
Someone made a post about Sheepsquatch as well tonight. I thought the dungeon and Sheepsquatch are coming next week.
---
It's my understanding the vending and camp stuff is coming next month. I could be wrong about that though.
---
1000 - 1200 (10 a.m.-noon) Eastern Time is what I've seen the last couple of times.
---
And more lit signs in general :)
---
Well that's what I do, but it would be nice to be able to build a base around different nodes. And it could easily be limited in ways to keep it from going "out of whack". Certain nodes limited to certain other nodes they can be changed with.
---
Thanks so much for this! I just hit level 40 and want to really start farming better equipment and West Tek gets recommended more than anywhere else (now I see why!) Much appreciated and I hope you got a few nice things you were hoping for :)
---
Puckseason came through, Thank you. You saved me a crazy amount of time hunting for tech data.
---
Lol probably!

it'd be nice to have a rustic set of building items. even someone weapons skin making them more...handmade.
---
10/10 would chuckle again.
---
I'm glad to hear this happens to other people, because this has happened to me so many times... Really frustrating, because my one-star gatling plasma is the only weapon I have that can kill those suckers in a reasonable amount of time. I suspect the rag doll effect still happens despite it turning to goo and it winds up bouncing off to a completely nonsensical place. Maybe it just completely disappears. The reality kinda doesn't matter.
---
LoL I was just kidding 😂
---
Here is a glitch for you - the behemoth in pond in the savage divide when killed doesn't drop any loot but the corpse teleports back to the middle of the pond. Happens every time since the last patch
---
Fair enough.
---
that article conspicuously left out all mention of the improved repair kits that will drop as in game loot.  seriously misleading article.
---
I've noticed that some of the legendary enemies in this game are particularly cowardly. Wonder why that is. It's kinda frustrating having to chase them down, however it's also kinda hilarious to find a Level 68 3-star Super Mutant Warlord and hear him yell "RUN AWAAAAAAY!" as he high-tails it.

On the interwebz one never knows ... subtlety is not the interwebz' thing ... \*grin\*
---
1-2 is about right gaming hard. Depending on your home situation. Sometimes I can only get 1 level if the wife has chores for me lol
---
Mine is doing the same can only talk yo people thru party chat
---
Usually it’s the lower levels who don’t know the etiquette yet or the level 200+ who know and do it on purpose. If it’s the first, I sometimes get on local and explain. If it’s the latter, they don’t need explaining
---
Yeah. Alpha not working
---
Since it's already been announced, they're going to go through with it, and once people start playing with it, they consider user input. Don't expect an announcement to be made on it outside of "Inside the Vault" or some other definitive channel.
---
But keep your voice up about it if you don't like it. Especially after it arrives.
---
I bought the camo power armor paint a few months ago. When the camo bundle came out I got it for free. Now I have camo paint for all the armor and the guns. I think the camo paint cost 1600 atoms at one time but I never saw the camo bundle price since I already "owned' it. Maybe I got screwed? idk
---
I fell through the ground?!?!?!   Arghhhh!!!!!!!!  :p
---
Make an alt and get the gear or else pay handsomely for it.
---
Yep when killing the queen takes 5mins
---
I meant to say CST.
---
I could see the acid/lead/copper/etc swapping without a huge deal. But the big ones (fusion cores, ammo, food, etc) should prob stay as they are. If anything, add a couple more of those spots
---
Oh Haha. I gotcha.  I'll def be on at that time
---
No one is forcing you to play like a little bitch....
---
It's called survival mode. Purposefully NOT surviving is your problem. No one else's. No one.
---
Cheers!
---
Intelligence does not boost experience gain in fallout 76, unlike in 4.
---
yeah.... think i'm gonna do the alt route, just need a courier.
---
Outstanding! set 'em down over there.
---
I'm really sorry that you need to hear it from me... They lied about it 😞, only experience from quest is unaffected, crafting and killing stuff, more intelligence more exp.
---
I don't use mine but have kept it because I can only get one. If you want it I could part with it. Haven't used it in 150 levels
---
Appalachia is a good area to settle compared to the larger cities. If the scorched plague was resolved in this season I think it's definitely feasible that new settlers and raiders show up in the area for wastelanders. Another thing I think will happen is the vaults opening up and us being able to make decisions of some sort. Maybe they have 2 or 3 different types of servers for players that picked certain pathways.
---
There are dozens of ways Bethesda could add living npc's into this game.  I would love to see the resurgence of the various factions and allow players to choose a "team".
---
Well, it's not the card's fault since the basic buffs come directly from the drink itself and not the card. The card is pretty self-explanatory (double effects of Nula-Cola products, triple effects of Nuka-Cola products), so all you gotta do is look at the things the various Nuka drinks do in the Pip-Boy, and if you don't have the card just do the math and double/triple them in your head. If you already have the card equipped, it does the math for you so you know what's gonna happen
---
I had a 1* mole rat drop a 3* piece. Nothing of note but it did drop one
---
oh yeah, the ones that are exclusive to workshops should stay that way
---
According to the roadmap then both player vending and shear terror are due to drop tonight.
---
Sorry am a real noob when it comes to reddit so can't link the picture but full roadmap is here
---

I'd be willing to pay/ trade. name your price.
---
New Code Cycle, Who dis!
---
New Code cycle, Who dis!
---
I’m gonna add to check out your base design. I also have a similar tower and looking for ideas to tweak the design a bit :)
---
House likes this.
---
Looking at Bethesda 76 site, then yes. But delays are known to happen. So, we'll see.
---
I did a loop of the Top of the world area (not top of the world itself) and came out with about 750 steel. While doing this you also get caps from super mutants and a good amount of xp.
---
Oh damn, I will definitely have to test this out later today, as I have been running a low int character for all of my gameplay after seeing that it made no mention of xp and I had read that int was changed, thanks!
---
Something similar happened to me, I was maybe level 10 and my husband was over 100. Some high level cunt in a Nuka Girl outfit came and trashed my camp while I was working on it, and then doubled back to wreck things as I was fixing them. Ended up breaking every single thing except my lawn flamingos. Hubby comes in and beats the shit out of her, but she keeps using stimpaks so it's a back and forth of almost dead to healed and back again. She gave up after a minute or so; I hope she wasted a lot of stimpaks.
---
I always get on the mic in this event and try to be a good team player. I get pissed when people 1 shot the legendaries in this event. I've even had some cool trades with people after its over.
---
FO76 has answers for you as part of the lovely Whitespring exploration experience. No spoilers for you though, take a look at some of the messages left behind around the resort. All will become clear in time. Time is infinite, you can never run out of time.
---
I’d love to encounter big foot in this game
---
Won't be on much this week (work stuff) but i'll be on this weekend
---
Bench pressing 300 lbs isn't a huge feat. Neither is trading for a full set of assassin sent/cav. I have all three
---
It needs to FORCE you into pacifist at 0 Caps
---
Yeah, they said on the last inside the vault that they were putting player vending off until next month. The rest is supposed to be coming.
---
Trust no one..
---
I thought I was crazy when I was only seeing one unique perk on my drops, but I guess it's not a guarantee...I should not have assumed it would be a 3 star drop...
---
All I see is a 404 using that link. Am I the only one?
---
I would love more foundation pieces than concrete and wood. Let me make an astroturf foundation to make my own lawn. Or have my bottom floor be nice hard wood without making a floating foundation.
---
Adventure mode to start for sure
---
My theory on griefers is the same as it is for high school bullies. They have family problems or personal problems and are using it as an outlet. I found out nearly every kid who bullied me in school had major issues in their personal life. Divorces, abuse, deaths of family members, parents with drug problems, parents with alcohol problems, parents who were just never there.
---
I don't give them a pass for the behavior, but I at least understand where it's coming from usually.
---
Photoshop either power armor helmet or vault boy onto the head and this picture would be perfect.
---
Old news, but thanks. There's probably some new player who doesn't know.
---
Why not both? Lol
---
That's because these codes all expired. It's now April 9th for most people. Sorry. I'll try and get the new ones up soon. Need to solve them first. 
---
I haven't confirmed yet but [Nukacrypt](https://nukacrypt.com/solved) is pretty reliable. They have Silo Alpha solved as: 84138947 
---
Good luck. :)

Always watch your food and hunger bar but most importantly. If you see a person with a gun that shoots explosive bullets. Do not fight back

Child of the 80's? Most of us are like this because when Ole' Dutch was El Jefe, EVERYTHING in pop culture was end of the world/post apocalyptic/doom on you kinda stuff.

I've had my camp set up like a store since the second month. I'm stoked for player vending. But I can wait. It's progress. I have 2 mule characters. If they pool the vendor caps they go from being useless to making money. That's good enough for now.
---
Re: 3, unarmed weapons absolutely do benefit from The generic “melee” Strength perks like Incisor and Martial Artist. Just to be clear.

Also, ninja and mister sandman are both Agility perks, not intelligence.

The image is there just for fun. I just thought it was weird so I shared it.
---
What I'm talking about in the actual post is finding technical data in the drawers of the desk in the Military Wing. I've found 7 technical data over the course of three play sessions and have turned each of them in to try to get the power armor paint plans since I don't have them yet.
---
I picked up some 3\* armor off of the bot in Charleston lastnight, during my server hop session for the rare vendor...It had 20% reduction on chems/aid, food and what not..it was nice, swapped my weapon 20% slot for it and actually lost 10-15lbs...the gear I bought also had +1 strength and I can put pockets on it...and the condition meter is near maxed, I think I won the jackpot on that...
---
Nope. Would make some locations pointless to build in. Things that promote building in otherwise remote locations is good, Imo.
---
Yeah, I didn't know if it was common knowledge or not. I just wanted to share it with players who might not have known.
---
Try and at least have a rough outline of what build you are going for.  
---
Study the perk cards and map out a build.
---
😥 How else is a socially phobic loner who finds interaction with others stressful supposed to sell all the stuff clogging up my stash and inventory?
---
Just have to hang out for the legendary vendor it seems...

---
Robots piles are tough to find. For corpses just wait a bit and listen. The flies will guide you!
---
Anti-armor is multiplicative, not additive. There is no way to negate 100% armor. Regardless, if DR/ER mattered, everyone would be running around in power armor for PvP. 
---
Damage mitigation is far more powerful, that's why people use sentinel/cav gear. You only need one gun army because the staggers from one gun army break through that damage reduction armor.
---
Stabilized doesn't make you much more offensively capable enough to make you sufficiently more defensive, so it's better to just make a build that doesn't rely on it. If you can't get the gear to make that build, it's probably better to just get a different build. There's a reason the most dominant builds in survival right now are rifle builds.
---
The quest will probably be post-Scorchbeast Queen. I have a feeling that it will be about rebuilding Appalachia as NPCs from other regions and vaults arrive. The quests could revolve around establishing settlements and aiding recolonization.
---
While I can understand not wanting to lose the caps, why not at least  collect the resources from the workshop and leave the server when someone tries to claim it then? At least that way you get something. Hell sometimes I'll hold the workshop all day and not be challenged and I'm only at lvl 80.
---
I'm currently level 73 on Xbox on the grind to 100 for all achievements but it has been rough since I keep running out of ammo, and I can never repair my gear because materials go faster than I find them. Tried to do the steps to drop a nuke today but for some reason level 20 Assaultrons were just shredding my health and armor to an almost enraging level. 
---
Any high level players have tips?
---
that's how I got my 3\* FE Handmade...600caps well spent.
---
Get your own gun with better explosive rounds and DO fight back.
---
Is that solo?
---
That’s an interesting factoid indeed, definitely a new griefing technique I’ll keep in mind 😂 jk.. sorta
---
That's my big wait. I won't need 2 mules if I can burn all the 1 star nocturnal wood armor I have sitting on them. Haven't sold or dropped a single legendery since theyve announced it.
---
No its online also but survival is constant pvp, although survival does have an exp boost
---
No co op
---
Damn good question! Would explain the scorch mods that Nerf effectiveness for everything else.
---
Oxhorn. His videos are very detailed, full of fantastic information, and he is positive about the game. Oxhorn is one of my favorite youtubers.
---
Oh sweet that does sound like a good place to start. I'm worried of joining and getting murdered on repeat.
---
Least u dont have to worry about me one shotting things. 😉
---
I mean, I had a Prime Zealot's Gatling Plasma and it melted those things even w/o any heavy gunner perks. No comparisons done though, however
---
Yea, it sucks....I took a gamble of 300ish caps on a piece of 3\* gear at a vendor bot lastnight and lucked out, Troubleshooter's Heavy Leather leg, +1 Strength and 20% reduced weight on all food and chem items. Put pockets and shadowed on it.
---
If you put passive mode on in the options you won’t be able to hurt others/ get hurt by others(adventure mode)
---
You can co op in survival,  and they'd level up faster in it.  If you stay away from train stations and stay off the leaderboard you can have a fine experience on Survival even without wanting to PvP
---
You're fine dude don't worry
---
 You can make that in half a run bro
---
Can confirm. Once I decided to start fight with a deathclaw with some crackshots from random looted pistol on my melee character, joke damage, but whatever. So there I was, running after deathclaw with 10mm pistol, along the way we run into in mr. gutsys, fighted them (deathclaws don't like them too), and then continued our pursuit. This was hilarious.
---
Ok so I have to be in adventure mode with passive on. Got it. I'm stoked to play. I've played the series just have stayed away due to reviews. We're going to take the plunge and hope for the best.
---
Don’t down vote him because he’s keeping secrets, he found those routes he has every right not to share them
---
Get level 3 fireproof and it does like 10% damage
---
Will do!
---
Hehe fucktron
---
Haha this is true.  I would like to tack onto one of those quick queen kills though.  Even doing the cryolator thing it still takes me a while usually
---
Yea definitely
---
I think because of the prime receiver no?
---
Thirty years ago I would have questioned the sanity and/or sobriety of anybody that suggested that a state make a serious tour guide based on a video game. 
---
Yay?
---
Someone get this to Bethesda.
---
Most of the major bugs have been fixed by now, you two should definitely enjoy yourselves :)
---
Just proves the top comment that they knew this would piss people off and decided to do it anyways with the hopes of that if they say nothing people will eventually "get over it" and the hub bub will die down.
---
If you want to use power armor from an early level, then Raider is the first set you'll be capable of wearing at level 15. Otherwise, strip all parts off the chassis, leaving only the power core, and you'll be able to use it from level 1. Will increase strength and carry weight
---
Get a suppressor AutoGrenade and grief a whole queen killsquad...
---
Might be why I got one of the paints at first but then beans since then.  Well,  besides a bomber jacket, that was cool.
---
I would love this
---
Another thought, shield + pistol. Maybe trade the ability to aim with the ability to block, or replace the regular bash with a shield strike. I love the idea of shield+pistol but I almost never see games use it.
---
Yeah an achievement would be kinda cool, there is a static spawn on the roof of West Tek tho so I don’t think the stats should be buffed to anything crazy if they were to do that. They also announced a while ago that we will be able to display items from our stash in our camps, not sure if this applies to aid items but I guess we’ll see.
---
Never been a fan of power armor.
---
What were you gonna do in the nuke zone with no ammo if it didn’t expire? Lol
---
After the initial quest that shows you how, don't waste resources early on repairing your stuff. It's easy enough to find new gear at lower levels just replace it with . Hoard screws and springs, they will be very essential later on. Don't fear the high levels, if one is running towards you they probably want to give you things. If they initiate trade don't request their fancy weapons, not that they'll attack you or anything, but it's quite annoying. Have an idea of what build your going for, and don't run around with things like lockpick or hacker equipped, just switch them in when you need them. Don't stress things like radiation and hunger, the game literally rains items that deal with those. The weapon and armor rewards you get during the story all scale to level, so it can be beneficial to grind out levels in between quests. This is especially true as you get closer to the end of the story. If you spend a lot of time building a cool camp it's so friggin gratifying when some stranger happens by it and starts spamming the heart emote and takes selfies with it.
---
My workshops have been overtaken by sheepsquatch pretenders for too damn long. I’m ready for the real thing.
---
Yes. Which is why AA is a Terrible melee legendary, you’re reducing 50% of 25%... so AA melee is removing 12.5% armor. Or like 5% damage increase. Might as well get a Mutant’s weapon.
---
Initiate and Knight (I think?) exist. I've gotten both from the Forbidden Knowledge quest.
---
People asked for it, but they asked for it as an item you could get in game or make in game. Not as an atom shop thing you could buy (even if you can get them in game too. The problem is you can buy them in the atom shop and that means Bethesda can change the game around for the worse  to encourage more sales of them).
---
I thought Skyrim was going to get incorporated somehow
---
Thank you for understanding
---
That’s an interesting bug that I’ve never encountered or heard of before, I’d definitely submit a ticket to Bethesda if you’re positive that’s what happened.
---
Think you could show me a screenshot?
---
Possibly when I get off work. I haven't used the second paint yet but I can show you that I have the paint available to use.
---
I don't think you have to worry. Watching the Q&amp;A from whatever the event was a while back, the guy with the moustache (you'll know who if you look it up) seems to be the guy really into the backpacking culture. They joked how he's a wannabe forest hermit. 
---
Why is that good? Because I'm on that wavelength. As many of you know, backpacking nerdom is serious business. This guy we're talking about is a finely curated hipster (that stache). With how the gaming industry is, I imagine he doesn't get out nearly as much as he likes, so there's going to be some pent up expression. He has quite a bit of say with the art department. You could see his excitement and obvious commitment to the "backpacking" sort of content. We already see the Pip-boy paint job with the nature sticker bomb. That's a hiker trope, usually covering your nalgene or something with stickers of all of the places and trails you've hit. 
---
We already see the Pip-boy paint job with the nature sticker bomb. That's a hiker trope, usually covering your nalgene or something with stickers of all of the places and trails you've hit. If we're getting something as silly as nature sticker bombing, you better believe we'll get pack customization options. 
---
There's nods all over in the game already as well. We have the Thru-hiker perk card. Thru-hikers are long trail folk. The Appalachian Trail, running the entire East Coast from South to North, passes through West Virginia (though honestly a short portion all things considered), RIGHT. NEXT. TO HARPERS FERRY. Literally if you followed the rails East of the town in game, around where it gives out is exactly where the trail head hop on is in real life (If we're getting specific trails, I honestly think this will be the sort of "finale"). We have park ranger gear, clean versions, a jumpsuit and power armor labeled with Parks logos. Camping and Glamping sites all over the map, marked trail heads guided with intention.
---
I think it's safe to say there's likely several nature nerds that are into the design and aesthetic. There's no way we're getting something like a 1-3 different looking bags for each tier and that's it. 
---
Also, if we can get skins for Candy Canes and Wiffle Bats, I'm sure they'll be adding cosmetic customization to a whole new giant piece of art on our backs.
---
Far as I can tell, nope. Which proves the theory they absolutely knew this would upset us and are doing the introduce it anyways and just refuse to talk about it so that it blows over eventually. All their community managers in here have stayed silent which probably means they've been told not to talk about it. Not a good sign :(. Shows Bethesda is planning on doing this and already was planning on weathering the outrage it would create.
---
First time hearing of this
---
[NEXT JOKE ORIGIN](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChoosingBeggars/comments/7kr5as/i_need_a_free_100mile_bus_trip_for_20_people_and/)

Fair enough. Then ignore everything I said... 👍🤐👍
---
I've seen some posts about it. 
---
Often you can find 2 tech documents in there, so the strategy is to take one, but don't take the 2nd one you see. Then fast travel to turn it in. Fast travek back. Pick up the 2nd one, then fast travel to turn it in.
---
This is some solid advice! Thank you. Do you if it's super easy to just invite my wife to the same lobby?
---
As people have repeatedly said, it's not about the repair kits themselves. It's about Bethesda breaking a promise. If they are willing to break a promise they made for money, they may take it further.
---
It's never about the repair kits.
---
Not relevant, but ok, bot.
---
The reward is the yummy pie
---
Yeah, that's probably it. In the descriptions for every prime receiver I've seen, they mention bonus damage to both scorched and scorchbeasts. That's not the case for the Zealot's prefix, so I assume it doesn't include scorchbeasts. Haven't officially tested to compare, so can't say for sure 🤷‍♂️
---
Also be sure not to loot the contents of the desk if it’s not technical data, if you hop servers you have a chance for it to spawn technical data next time but you’ll have to wait for the desk to reset if you loot it.
---
It would be interesting to see a zealots explosive with a prime receiver put in
---
Take an upvote for effort!
---
Yeah, I farmed some Technical Data over the weekend, ended up getting the Bomber Jacket and Field Scribe uniform and some useless nocturnal gear.
---
If you actually do have it I'm going to be super jealous
---
If I do try it I will follow the advice! 😎
---
I actually do have both. *cue jealousy* lol
---
I want a bloody explosive 50cal and a bloody fire rate Gatling gun... my bloody Gatling gun does 600 damage per the pip-boy. (20% health build).
---
Although sometimes I’ve seen the damage bug out; that might be a bugged number, I think I’m normally around 490.
---
&gt; There's a reason the most dominant builds in survival right now are rifle builds.
---
Which won't last because it means that the game is unbalanced.   Re-balancing is a certainty  in any MMO when any single build becomes dominant.
---
I think the problem with FO76 is that there is a large base who never really wanted pvp in the first place. Then there's the hardcore pvp players excited to go on virtual murder sprees. So, they tried to mesh two completely different play styles together which was never going to be a total happy ending for everyone. 
---
I hate most pvp because I suck at it so I would never play COD or ARK or anything like that. But, I love Fallout which has always been single player until now. So, to counter your question, why should I have to stay away from a series I love simply because it was advertised not as a strictly pvp game but as both? 
---
I think most of the griefing in 76 isn't really griefing. I wouldn't consider someone killing or trying to engage you once or twice without consent griefing. If they don't leave you alone when you clearly don't want to engage or have asked them to stop then yea. If they are very obviously doing things to pester and annoy or messing with mechanics, yes.
---
Theyve been quiet for literal days up until this post. They already gave us their response without having to actually give us a response.
---
I’ll come take come stuff off your hands..
---
I’ll even wear my weightless armor and be invisible so you can pretend I’m not even there.
---
Well the way i look at it is that is a very useful almost always on card for playing survival mode currently (i started from scratch with my girlfriend for survival mode so I'm in the middle of building a 75% pvp build with enough utility left over in it so that we can do most of the crafting without having to mule things to a crafting account and back over again.
---
But pvp in fallout lives and dies by its ability to deal out damage while mitigating it at the same time either by having a powerful alpha strike so you end the fight with one shot or you hide and keep chipping away or you have the gear and peak cards to run up into their grill and start blasting (my personal plan in survival mode is shotguns and PA so far it seems to be going pretty well the peak that tightens you spread with the shotguns is a must but at lvl 3 its like your firing slugs when you use a long barrel you can get most of the pattern into a dudes head at 30 yards and the same with a super mutant's noggin at a little more.)
---
Then again the joy of the peak system is that you can change things out to fit the situation as it evolves so the more time you put in the more options you have.
---
Ad Victoriam :'(
---
Nah, half the time I wasn't at camp when it got attacked. They always target the nice stuff or generator then left. With locked door and traps? Nope.
---
Jesus. I wish you woulda started with Whitesprings. I would skipped passed it. Damn you and your cliffhangers.
---
All of them exist, I have a friend with everything up to elder which he painted himself after farming like 1000x of forbidden knowledge
---
Yeah, she can join your session right from the social menu, or if you're in a console party you can join as a group. If one of you join a world and the other goes to join you might get stuck in queue though. It's never a long wait though, less than 5 minutes usually.

I got them all from turning in data. I don't really have any tips. You just got to keep turning in data. But you do have to learn the plan to get the next plan in line.
---
I’m trying so hard to get my husband to play, but he’s afraid of the ghouls.
---
Definitely invest in the fix it good and weapon artisan perks to increase the life of your repairs. Ammo wise I’d recommend collecting ammo you don’t use and trading it on the market 76 for what you do need or you can farm west Tek for steel and gunpowder and hit places like lucky hole mine for lead, just make sure you have acid to smelt it. Alternatively just build your base in a lead deposit and you’ll be set there. 
---
I’d have to know more about your build and what kind of armor/weapons you use to help you with being a little more tanky.
---
Not sad at all. It's cathartic. In the wastes you have an opportunity to do something and be somewhere else. That something/somewhere is so foreign to the normality that we experience daily. I really enjoy my life. I have a beautiful family and a good job. Since I first played Fallout starting at 3 then going back to the beginning I fell in love with the lore and the ability to do something and be somewhere else.
---
This change occurred because people said the game was too unbalanced so they changed some mechanics to make many more builds less viable.
---
Being ambush hunted on a map because you are doing quests and have been alive longer than everyone else is pretty whack. I’m all for the less restriction attacking players but being highlighted on a map with fast travel points around you is really poor design.
---
Yeah, I should have checked to see if this was common knowledge before I posted. But if this helps someone who doesn't know about it then I did my job.
---
ESO was developed by Zenimax I think. And is more of an MMO than 76 which ditches standard MMO elements.
---
I swear someone was doing that to me and my friends today, also the queen was being a real one and landed all of 3 times. Luckily we got her but with about 30 seconds left and a lot less ammo than we started off with 😂
---
come back when you do it to a Mr. Gutsy he'll actually chase you down as a floating ball of death.
---
And also just in case you weren't aware there's a patch tomorrow so the servers will be down for a couple of hours in the morning. It's a significant patch that's adding new quests and I think a new dungeon, so expect Appalachia to be quite busy!
---
This just happened to me recently also. I killed the robot with a shotgun at a reasonable range, waited a few seconds to be safe... Then looted the robot wreckage, and as though it's a big cruel joke, it exploded and killed me immediately after looting it.
---
It was in Watoga, and the only upside is that you can respawn very close to just about anywhere you were and get your precious junk.
---
EAT THE WEAK
---
Oh, scrap everything, that's  *everything* you don't actually need to survive. You won't need half the stuff you find for at least the first 10 levels. And by then, you should have a good supply for crafting, building. Plans and recipies need to be learnt. Go to your notes section, and activate them there.
---
Shields can be extremely dangerous frisbees as well!
---
Did you turn off pacifist mode? :P
---
It was developed by zenimax you are correct sir....I'm just saying they are in the same group..they need to work together
---
I wonder if it might actually be tied to how much folks are pvping?  Like tonight on a quiet ps4 server, no one was highlighted.  And then on a noisy one, people were highlighted... but I'm not sure if I was, since no one came to harass me.
---
I follow low levels drop stuff on the ground for them and shoot it till they notice
---
After posting that your link was finally working, i had the same problem viewing images link from several others posts on reddit.
---
If 76 become any more of an MMO I’d kill myself
---
Agreed.
---
Hate to break it to ya, but West Virginia dosent have any ocean areas for big sharks or jellyfish. But I like the idea nonetheless!
---
It's not about the violence it's about them feeling superior for the ego boost. The goal is to frustrate other players and make them feel inferior; make them feel that their efforts in the game are wasted because this person attacking them is better then them. That's why the more you react to them the longer they bother you, and if you leave and don't give them the opportunity to feel superior they will often pursue you via xbox or PSN chat and try to engage you there (glad I'm on PC). I think the only time you see violence really translate from a game to reality is for people who have serious mental disorders that don't allow them to properly draw lines between what's real and what isn't. That's really uncommon though. I don't think that represents even .01% of people who play games.
---
Chess would be cool using the robot models as the pieces. As for the strength game. I could totally see a traveling robot carnival that has games similar to the ones in Camden park that players can wage caps on. 
---
I have an idea for the card game idea but I’m still piecing the workings of it together.
---
I just invite everyone to a team and when it's over I leave the team.
---
I find as a heavy gunner I tend to do most of the damage and get most of the kills so it doesn't seems fair not to share the exp
---
There’s a few groups of players that set up boxing arenas which you can blow your caps at and win some and it’s great fun
---
Wouldn’t recommend it for brand new people. Really high chance of getting shot in all of the starting areas. It’s not good to quest in the forest in Survival.
---
Thank you
---
I mean 30% more damage is definitely worth it to me, just depends on if you’re willing to put in the time and effort to gathering all the resources. I usually keep a couple prime guns of different calibers and a couple non prime guns. When the SBQ is in the air I target her wings with normal legendaries and when she lands I whip out the heavy duty prime receivers and get to work.
---
I recommend getting a gun like a 50 cal or handmade that uses violet flux since it’s so prevalent around fissure site prime
---
You broke the first rule.
---
Lmao
---
Plan your builds so you don’t have to make a new character at lvl 45 because you’re underpowered
---
Not what I'm calling for..read the post
---
I agree. Playing in that lonely wasteland just reinforces how empty my house is 😂
---
How about pool or darts? The stuff is in the game already. Seriously this game needs to go with private servers and allow modding already
---
I'm willing to bet there wont be a workaround. And lets be honest if your trapped and over encumbered why not just hop server to free yourself.
---
Also on xb1 there’s a group who’s set up a games carnival
---
Anytime you pay to gain an advantage over people that don't pay for that advantage it is pay to win.

I had a legendary ghouls just disappear as I was about to loot my first plasma weapon. Just vanished I was still in its inventory
---
I have a huge suspicion one of the Vault raids will be Robot enemies.
---
Mine only works when I switch it off and back on again. Also, people on game chat are complaining it's quiet, not so in party.

BoS: Reduced weight of all  laser weapons, ammo, heavy weapons and PA pieces. Higher chance of learning a new mod from scrapping. Bonus rewards/XP for completing BoS Events
---
Enclave: Reduced weight on Plasma weapons, ammo and rifles.  Increased rewards from Enclave events, Crafting energy weapons costs less.
---
Responders: 10% bonus XP while in a group, reduced weight on all chems, aid items and food. Crafting medical supplies costs less or more can be made at cost of the same amount of materials. Bonus XP and rewards for Responder events.
---
Not sure about other factions, these are just off the top of my head.
---
Tesla is a rifle, if you throw a shotgun mod on it then it is still a rifle with a shotgun spread. 
---
I have a tse Tesla with a shotty mod. I use explosives and rifle perks and really love the thing
---
You're in an **extreme** minority if you actually *want* non-cosmetic microtransactions on the shop, buddy.
---
I remember making a similar post previous patch, and I think they changed it, it still explode, but not immediately, around 10 seconds are its dead, should give you enough time to grab the legendary and run
---
But bak to the point, YES, i died a couple of times due to the explosion :(
---
For the bloodied who cherish their rads, Brahmin milk is pretty awesome for removing rads without also removing mutations. 
---
It's too bad brahmin milk spoils so fast, if only we could make brahmin milk cheese with similar effect but a longer shelf life. Or powdered brahmin milk whey protein? (+1 strength and -25 rads)
---
Yes I do every other fallout had that
---
Where do you go to switch on and off do you just change it from none to auto or something
---
I say have it around 70 damage by default. But the fusion mag mod put its down to around normal energy weapons around 45.
---
What do you mean? Co op is you just join a team together
---
This bug has existed for a while on XB1. Re-fast traveling to the location or worst case scenario, leaving server and coming back tends to fix.
---
I’m not sure whether or not you can only make it once, but I’d try to pick up another worn veil in order to get back into the mansion. Should be some of their corpses by Camden park and the Charleston capital
---
I will add everyone tomorrow?
---
I've found the Exterminator perk and explosives to be rather effective against their legs which aren't that thick or protected. Cripple those and they're pretty much easy pickings when they're brought to a slow crawl.
---
I think they probably will allow food to decay while up for sale. Currently you can sell food to a robo vendor and it will decay to spoiled in their inventory.
---
Fuck they do have Nuka Orange? I've literally hoarded those in 4 and heard rumors and talk across Appalachia about it. I'm hyped!
---
I'd love it if they introduced an NPC from out West, a trader who wants to play Caravan and sells card game table plans to players.
---
And maybe let us collect Tragic cards. That'd be hilarious.
---
Seems like we are the only fans that want this
---
Cycle it through area to none to team and back to auto, but make sure to leave it on area or none and back out and then go back in again. This part of game sucks. Also, check chat volume slider.
---
Im only like 106 hours in. No way lol
---
And they only attack with the drill because it is a legendary drop...
---
Its from the atom shop, might not be there any more but worth a look
---
Can you still sell inert flux and ionized meat to vendors? Thought they changed that in the last patch.
---
A run through glassed caverns nets you around 70 ultracite, it’s actually one of the easiest ingredients to get in comparison to gunpowder lead and flux imo. Everyone’s got different playstyles but Personally I can craft over 100k ultracite ammo in a month if I wanted to, not something I like to devote my time too tho.
---
Cool. Does the Tormentor perk work with it to cripple limbs?
---
Haha, thank you
---
I have a zealot's Gatling laser with heavy gunner perks and yes, I can see a real difference when using it on scorched beasts.
---
You know they don't get loot or xp unless they tag the mob even in a team right?
---
Frustrating
---
Omg yeah springs I never thought I would love a resource so much
---
Hmm let's see what's in this safe oh a level 50 assault rifle with night vision powerful automatic receiver I guess I'll take it if I have too..... OMG is that a clip board and a pencil on that desk!?!? Hurray OH A TYPERWRITER TOO!? Jackpot!!! What's in this next room? Kids toys!!??!!? Hold on while I mark down this location I've found the mother lode.
---
Dont get me started on the weights. As a heavy machine gunny lead is worth its weight in bottle caps to me
---
I find that if someone was event hopping they will eventually find a player like me farming xp.
---
I get that the OP didn't denote the sarcasm, but it should be somewhat obvious...
---
Don’t trip, the “rare” items you’ll get flagged for don’t include normal ammo. Ultracite ammo seems to be on the list tho so I wouldn’t exceed 100k in a 30day period.
---
Counter: Knowing everything immediately is boring.
---
Nerds go outside now (sometimes). It's quite a lucrative market.
---
Same. All of my perks are in heavy guns so my explosive two-shot handmade doesn't do a whole lot of damage. I can fire repeatedly and get the tag without killing it.
---
you wanna know where it is?
---
right here of course [The build in question](https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/comments/bb3cxt/build_out_by_camp_venture/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

Sarcasm born of frustration.  I understand now why the /s is so important in text communication... 
---
I bet you would read Jonathan Swift and take it seriously lol.
---
In my excitement I rushed over and found it, was about to chug the nuka orange when I realized it heals 450 hp and seen I shouldn't waste it but I'm glad they gave it the respect it deserves
---
How many points do you have in Perception and Agility? If you can afford to spec into a stealth sniper or commando build that place is a gold mine and isn't much trouble. Since you already have high strength being a melee you can go heavy weapons PA as well, though it's significantly harder on your resources and can be difficult to come out ahead.
---
What an obnoxious writing style
---
She can land around V-9 if she's aggro'ed on a player in a valid landing zone. However, if you paid attention to who she's aggro'ed on when she lands, she always has to be aggro'ed to a player in a valid landing zone. 
---
That is not the case when everyone is hopped up on the roof and fences of V-9
---
Bwfore I got Mersupial I also fear the ghouls. Freaking jerk reaction when I shoot them nakes them unpredictable

I have so many I sell them cheap to vendors without Hard Bargain equipped just to clear my stash. Would be nice if player vending allowed be to get a decent price for them.
---
I try to only keep 20 on me and 20 in the stash ideally since they weigh so much.
---
Ah well lol I still like them haha, no matter the numbers. Call me stubborn or stupid, anti-armor is my favorite effect, especially with guns
---
West Virginia doesn't have aquariums?
---
Thanks. Guess I haven't been lucky enough yet.
---
It was the same with my wife 😃
---
Ok I’ll try that thanks
---
I  love my alternative being buy a new console, new copy of the game and restart. :)
---
I had a 3* charred drop a syringer. Just a syringer.
---
Tell me about it. I've started converting my ungodly amount of lead into 5mm just because the 5mm is weightless to me and I've got a decent minigun. It's such a hungry weapon, I should probably get myself a good Gatling too, but I hate that weapon. It's way more efficient than a minigun though.
---
Crap there was a good breakdown about how "Ultra" settings are actually insane and will bog down anything. I don't have a link to the thread but the author said you'll want to start over entirely, put it on Medium presets then edit everything up or down with the options.
---
Also this game will never run perfectly smooth, the engine is janky in single player and multiplayer puts even more pressure on it.
---
\[*translating from Cricket*\] 'tis but a scratch! Have at thee! \*grin\*
---
If you're using regular armor, get white knight perk, and fix it good (when you repair). Lucky Break if you're seriously having issues in PvE armor breaking. Gunsmithing/Makeshift warrior perks help with guns/melee. Scrapper perk + more intelligence gets more materials per scrapping.
---
Other than that, general damage reduction / armor / damage increasing perks such as adrenaline. If you were on PC I could help you out directly. 
---
Feel free to take over workshops, or go hunting in army bases / survival camps  / military bases for ballistic fiber. 
---
Also, melee + power armor is the most material effecient way to farm, as power armor takes a LOOOOONG time to break. Technically T-60 armor is the cheapest to repair, but overall my favorite goes to excavator for sheer carry capacity.
---
Add item for item trading between players too.
---
If there was a solid reward for time on the leaderboard, I’d be ok with it. 
---
I *do* like how it makes you feel hunted sometimes, and I’ve had really good fights with people who posted up in a defensive position and waited for people to come attack.
---
As it is now, with no reward for being in the top 3 or for killing the top 3, I don’t get it. With no reward, have no one on the map. 
---
But I don’t think that should be the solution. That will just cause people to camp popular farming spots like West Tek and Whitespring even more than is already happening.
---
Players should just be rewarded for being on the leaderboards. With either caps, plans, XP, or all of the above. A massive XP boost while you’re on the leaderboard would probably be fair.
---
Yeah probably not if you're brand new, but I wouldn't discount it entirely after they get their feet wet
---
Haven’t used that, but to be quite honest, it one shots most things anyway
---
I don’t, actually.  I’d rather pay to access new content than see Bethesda finance it via the atomic shop.
---
The repair kit that is destined for the atomic shop will not have any negative effect on the game or players, though, despite so many fear mongers.
---
No. My home in the mire is a lovely escape.
---
As much as I like the idea, I don’t think the Jersey Devil fits into WV
---
Agreed
---
Camp McClintock and fort defiance for ballistic fiber, and the prison yard and fire station for lead... If you didn't already know. When I go in to launch nukes I always keep a few med-x and psychobuff on hand for when it gets thick. I have always gone in with power armor. Also don't bother looting when you're in there. Not worth the risk imo.
---
No, we won’t, because a more effective model will be available in-game via quest.
---
Amazing!
---
And you're an ignorant liar. Two peas in a pod, though at least I can take solace in the fact that I'm not in denial or a hypocrite about this whole thing.
---
Also make it so we can distinguish which power armor is which without taking it and placing it on the ground.
---
I am not high level (lvl 20) but I donate my old main weapons to a popular area for players before me with 10 purified waters and food.
---
I love how it emulates Poe's The Raven. You deserve a medal.
---
I spit on YT reviews and commentaries.
---
UUUUUUU
---
50 k caps I’ll sell.
---
Yes, I want a Free States robot, no government bureaucrats here!
---
In Fallout 4, Brockton, MA was pretty photorealistic.
---
Does nuking it make any difference in the mobs?
---
just to clarify, set the default preset to medium then adjust everything else around it, but avoid ultra settings individually like textures, etc?
---
Almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter?
---
Internally screaming out of jealousy
---
I doubt it, but it’d be worth a try.
---
That would span the full spectrum from awesome to horrifying.
---
Quality camp!
---
Caravan?
---
Im in love
---
This is amazing
---
Omg these are so cute
---
bad bot
---
I tried changing to team chat, that didn't help, but maybe muting and un-muting will help.
---
Thats hilarious lol
---
That's where you went wrong. Just save armors that are 1.5 pounds or under. I've got so much weightless armors...
---
Luckly my gear is mostly legendary and doesn't appear in the list, but I just scrapped my Shielded Vault 76 jumpsuit that I had since the beginning of the game this weekend, so sad.
---
Chally, the likely scenario is Fallout 76 is far short of its projected revenue, so funding for further development may depend on introducing more enticing items into the atomic shop.  I personally prefer they go the route of paid access to future content.
---
What do you mean? I don't see anyone not being helpful? Lol. Thanks though. I have run that a time or two and now you mention it, I think I do recall it being a good spot. Thanks!
---
I just want the Bumper Sword from Fallout 3.
---
I save that for the line or gouhls chasing me. Or the Mutants in the church at Harper's Ferry. I shoot thru the door and toss gernades in.
---
Do I need some mod on the PA?
---
This is amazing good job dude
---
Maybe the ones you fail on are bulls?
---
Not just favorites, I'd like to be able to toggle any weapon or armor as unscrappable. If I can name them, I should also be able to tag them this way, and as long as they are in my possession person/stash they retain this.
---
I think people need to be able to build small gov't supply drop pads at their camps. When they do, they'll be able to receive random stuff such as cans of soup from generous community missions like in OP's example, as well as be able to send/receive loot to other players on other servers (including secondary characters).
---
Anything except atom shop items.
---
you have newest drivers for your video card?
---
Can you at least in survival make it so of someone attacks a player inside WS they are instantly enemies with white spring bots. That way pvp is possible, but getting out with the kill will be a challengem
---
I guess some kinda wanted it but somehow just don't want to voice out their opinions but I guess someday an NPC would become available in future updates.
---
What is the frequency in getting mods for the radium rifle via scrapping? Because I've probably scrapped 10ish and I've only unlocked 1 mod.
---
Ok weirdo
---
I guess we are at odds.
---
In my suggestion there is nothing that gives you more 'power' than another player.  End game is still endgame.  I believe that your truly think FO76 PLUS is considered PAY to Win.  But im sorry, it is not.  If anything, it is pay for advancement -- but you have to remember, at the end of the game, the chance to get items, is the same.  Nothing is different between a level 100 player and a level 300 player other than time invested.
---
A grand exchange, if you would.
---
Something that would make me actually do a melee build is a shield, and a stop sign would look awesome, as would any number of street signs. Some variation would be nice!
---
All heavy metal armour, an assaultron or eyebot helmet, sword and shield. Standing against the mutant menace, shiny and chrome.
---
Yes. Double, triple checked
---
All I. Hearing from.you is whining, quit your bitching and maybe find a REAL problem to complain about.
---
What do you mean one of the quests? Can you get a daily quest from him or something? Just got back on 76, did the quest line for him &amp; got the brewing station &amp; fermenter plans but no nuke dark &amp; no quests after I finished the mini-questline
---
You are probably fine unless you obtain ultracite ammo, ultracite, or flux. The ban only applies if you obtain rare items, so you should be fine.
---
Caravan has not yet been invented, though.
---
No, the Excavator by default has the ability to mine extra ore from each deposit. Matter of fact, you can put the Excavator arms on any other power armor and you will still get the ability to extract more ore. As long as you're using the Excavator arms.
---
I've read that zealot's doesn't affect scorchbeasts but hunter's does due to scorched beasts being labeled as an animal in the game files.
---
The codes always expire at the same time, so you should know in advance when to run a silo.
---
Agreed I was hyped when I saw it. First thought SBQ fights would-be dope if you can bait the adds into their own demise.
---
Lol thanks! I actually found another one in the room where the 3 are! So 4 total there! It's on the other side of that area on some shelves :) I'll include it as well.
---
I want to do one for adhesive and one for ballistic fibers, both are tough to farm on purpose when you need it. I know of two good spots for the BF but so does everyone else lol
---
Nice place! Great work. I use to camp there too. I loved the pond and the close proximity to the train station. I ended up moving to Twin Lakes because there’s good hunting, I like being on the water, and It’s relatively close to The Whitespring too for when nukes drop. Sometimes I wish I was still where you are though  because of how close it is to the plans/recipe loop (Raider flea market area) at Pleasant Valley Cabins. I’m rambling... a little context, 🙂 I’m always over-encumbered and never can fast travel so camp spots are hard sometimes (I’m in a play in the nuke zone phase). Someday I’ll stop hoarding things and find the perfect spot to build and fast travel everywhere.
---
I seriously think it's bugged. I've gotten 3 in 3 days.
---
Technically, neither has X-01 armor, yet here we are.
---
Yes tormentor does work
---
Is Dark affected by Cola Nut AND Party Boy/Girl?
---
I've seen so many people running power armor/melee but I have no melee based perks and the only weapon I have isn't very strong. The Power Armor HUD is really cluttered and annoying to me so I've been avoiding it unless I go to a nuke zone, but then I drop down my Excavator armor. As for the perk recommendations, I'll keep those in mind. I think I have the armor mod perk but even though I have broken down a ton of gear I still can't put useful mods in them. I'm in some real need of ballistic fiber because just about all my armor broke in that silo, so I'll start farming that. Thanks!
---
Is your monitor plugged into your gpu and not your mobo?
---
Loot yes, exp no.
---
RETREEEEAAAAAAAAT!
---
&gt;  If you can't get the gear to make that build, it's probably better to just get a different build. 
---
Why would I do that?
---
You seem to be responding to comments that I never made.   I never once said that "I had power armor and I got my ass kicked!" 
---
My earlier comments clearly stated that I'd use a power armor heavy weapons build and won.
---
Lol. Cheers. Good luck out there
---
they way he would talk about them was like it was the Alien guy from fo4.  When he would fight it; it would just teleport off.  I just never laid eyes on it, and I am just gonna assume its a variant or type of flatwoods thats super rare.
---
Card game in Fallout: New Vegas. Very easy to miss and they did a piss poor tutorial so no one ever played or talked about. Could have been great...
---
I have the same problem. Albeit if turn on my mic i get a full system crash and restart. The long system recovery restart.  I get about 15 secs of blissful static and BAM! Sadly the headset works on all my other things.
---
Same here, fellow wanderer. I've spent hundreds of hours in the wastelands.
---
Alright, good to know. I can't remember which Fort it is but one always has Scorchbeasts around who never seem to be worth killing for the sheer amount of bullets it takes to bring down, along with the sonic attack draining my health and very poor loot. I'll start going there more often though since I've got a massive shortage of ballistic fiber. Thanks!
---
My game runs flawlessly on ultra with a SLI 1080ti setup i7-6700 32gb
---
Sweet. Thanks!
---
Ya Nuka World on survival was brutal.  Wish they would have let me use the Vertibirds there.
---
Yeah, and if you kill one type of creature, whenever you encounter another one it should just die on its own.
---
 Nan-ni shimasu-ka?
---
I've never run a single mod on 76 and I had that problem.
---
Patch notes are released during downtime
---
To give them a tiny bit of credit, there are a serious number of players out there simply not interested in a majority of the cosmetic items in the shop and are sitting on thousands and thousands of ATOMs. 
---
Something small able to be purchased that has in-game value may be just what those types of players are looking for. The QoL improvement doesn't set them catastrophically ahead, in fact it's the inferior version of what everyone can grab. Even if you're rich as all hell and buy stacks on stacks of the things, you'll only have a real "leg up" if you're in a fight where your weapon is breaking enough to make the people with a modest 150% pile break down leaving you the only one with options. And that sounds like a SBQ attempt that just isn't going to happen with whoever is making that mess of a fight that long.
---
No one will be cruising around saying "oh yeah I never repair anymore I have plenty of kits", as the best available option is a few pieces of scrap and a 30 second jump to CAMP or a bench, or the decent drop rate for a great item that's 50% better. If you fully invested in the ATOM shop item, you would come out BELOW the performance of your peers. 
---
Doesn't feel much like pay to win as much as it does pay to repair your weapon half way through the Missile Silo because you were an idiot and jumped down the elevator with your weapon at 30% durability while hiding in a room with nowhere to run without packing extra improved kits. 
---
It's of course bending the promise to a very awkward stress point, but I really don't feel completely lied to. Not yet anyway. They've tiptoed up to the line, but I personally don't feel they've crossed it. 
---
In the case of total transparency, yeah it falls short. But really, as a AAA studio with serious brand recognition, coming out with a message saying "Hey we just want to be honest and cool with you guys, we know we said nothing beyond cosmetics, but...." would be utterly ripped apart by "gaming journalists" and gamers themselves. You know they'd get utterly REAMED even though it came with good intentions. Indie studios could probably get away with it, but a company with so much behind it unfortunately has to play the corporate speak game at all times. 
---
I hope they come out with a well written breakdown of their intent. I'm not upset that they didn't go full damage control and knee jerk react to the player base when it blew up. That's a damned if you do damned if you don't. Letting the conversation hang for a moment as people calm down, then having a detailed  well thought out breakdown of intent on an Inside the Vault is likely the best route when it comes to player satisfaction and the press. 
---
If they don't have some statement directly validating the outcry, as long as they simply introduce the system mechanics in a much clearer way while making clear that ATOM purchases are available but of course not supremely ideal, that would be ok enough for me. It's easy enough to read between the lines to see the actual "people" behind the headlines with a little bit of "walk a mile in their shoes" thinking. While it's a definite red flag, there's clear intent in trying to adhere to that promise while simultaneously not limiting the ongoing development of a cornerstone feature of the game. 
---
 If it's not a popular idea long term, I doubt they'll continue with it. While plenty in the dev cycle is likely set in stone, they DO have flexibility on what the fleshing out will be. In all honesty, the ATOM shop DOES need something beyond outfits and CAMP items to keep people doing dailies and weeklies. Without those, an end game player without cosmetic interests would spend the entire development cycle ignoring all challenges beyond maybe survival weapon weeklies. That leaves 0 real variety day to day in between content patches beyond whatever the player dreams up themselves. And that's simply not a great model to keep people playing and interacting.
---
Double standard-y, but I do kind of get it. Not saying you should still "trust" them. Trust any company with shareholders as far as you can throw it. Maybe just a little bit of a, don't give in to the anxiety of potential implications juuuuuuuust yet, people that care are aware.
---
The high-level players who help out are saints. One gave me Excavator power armor... at level 11. Another gave me an explosive, two shot, +30%-VATS-damage machine gun that required Ultracite .50 cal. Couldn’t use any of that stuff, but it sure was intimidating on display!
---
When I get tons of Rads that I can’t get rid of and I pass by high-level players, sometimes they just drop a ton of Rad stuff along with Purified Water and the occasional 50 caps and just continue their adventure.

These people NEED rewards.

Not sad at all.  There's a lot to be said for being in a jarringly different world, where you don't have *any* of the social or emotional baggage to deal with since it's just not relevant.  It's an amazing escape from everything you have to deal with in real life.

Did the nuke for the first time the other day. Took 14 stimpacks and died. Had a mate meet me outside with 10 more. Did it with 8 Stinson to spare. A tip... Do it with a crew I would imagine it being easier

Use the perk planner https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks to use your level ups efficiently, and always scrap all junk first before storing it in stash.

This was the story, of how fallout 76 became a good game

maybe something was planned to be up there, and they'd already done the stairwell before it was scrapped; no reason to go back in and remove stuff.

Some men just want to watch the world burn.

Have fun, and look out for survival mode.

😐

*deletes account*

Seriously, though, if I could damage these things, no server would ever have them again. I would make an OP melee character just to go around destroying these.

Gatorclaws are cool but they were spliced into creation in Nuka World.

I just dont want it period. If they want to keep leaderboards fine...just take my icon off the map. If they want to list who has been alive longest? Ok. Just take out the fast travel and map icons...dont mark me with my fucking name above my head. Dont mark me on the map. Dont give people to fast travel to the closest train station to cut me off at the pass.

Could be built for upcoming dlc's. Guess we will see!
---
A high level gave me both arms, a torso, and a head of T-51 power armor as a level 17 (i think) and i still have it

I try to warp to areas that are particularly difficult and see low levels having a difficult time to help em out. Something to do to pass the time.
---
Play your way, enjoy every moment.  Prepare for good days and bad. And always remember: You gotta shoot em in the head.
---
Yes, it isn't my first rodeo. I can play the Division 2, Battlefield 5, and Farcry New Dawn and have no issues.
---
Yeah I have 200+ stimpacks sitting in my stash. It is likely they will never be used.
---
Always drop any low level legendary gear I pick up at the overseers camp box. I don't know if anyone got it before the server reset but I hope they enjoy that quad ammo explosive shot 10mm level 5 pistol I left there a few days ago.
---
Yeah I refuse to play survival until they remove this. It makes it too easy for a level 300 to come over and kill a lower level player simply for surviving. They need to remove this. It should be more about never knowing if someone is around or if you’re safe. Marking the top 3 players on the map because they are alive is stupid.
---
I make deep pocketed leather armor which gives them hella carry boost and I ask they just give it to the next player they see when they rank up.

I'll add, of you started a new play through without Sim Settlements, you're missing out.

The lastest update of conqueror pretty changes how you play the game.

People recommend tech data farming at white springs for the same reasons they recommend XP farming  there; not because it's the best, but because it's a place to farm with the least amount of challenge.

Yeah you should hit white springs if you are serious about farming, but you should also hit sugar grove, all the power plants,  Robco, AMS Watoga and virtually  any place with filing cabinets.

Yeah ilike the centralized lication too

Try it out and see. Furious is a decent effect, works better on automatic and heavy weapons though. If you can do better with it than the hammer there's no reason not to switch.
---
Is number 46 still available?
---
Oh, God, the second we get cars, people will go insane and drive them full speed off of mountains into Scorchbeasts. If they make them do damage? Pray for all of the lil’ noobs. If they add fast-traveling in vehicles? FO76 and all of its players will be accurately represented by the soldier in the E3 trailer: dead, buried, and long since forgotten. Either that, or it’ll become Rocket League-style melee PvP.
---
Cool, I don't know a lot about legendaries so I thought if get a second opinion before I just sold it to the vendors or something
---
Way better but killing mole miners for level 40 garbage is way easier then killing level 69 Mister Gutsey's lol.
---
Got it on XB1 a few days ago. I only ever turn in one or two docs at a time.
---
Are you on Xbox? I could show you the route.
---
It's Hornwright testing site #3, south east side of Ash Heap. There are specific routes to take to find the Iron ore, I learned it from a post here on Reddit, if I can find it again I will link you.
---
It's a rifle with the semi-auto, charging barrel, and lobbing mods It works as an auto rifle with automatic mod. Rifleman, tank killer, tormentor, Commando, and ground pounder can be used with the respective mod.
---
Note that the armor reduction from tank killer doesn't affect energy damage.
---
Lucky boi:(( Ad Victoriam
---
I run a melee tank build and launching nukes is a non-issue for me. I one shot everything or run right thru with cavalier armor. With about 20 stimpaks and psychobuff I breeze thru. If I have one person with me it gets even easier. So long as no one fast travels and triggers a respawn- I'm always guchi. Just takes too long.
---
yes
---
Are you on ps4? If so, I have some extra junk/weapons I can get you.
---
I'm also willing to discuss perk builds, if you would want this scrub's opinion, that is.
---
Link to the source?
---
I mean, they could just increase the radius of the camp based on the number of players in the team.
---
Reckon the Dcg hits a lot quicker than all rise.  I use variations of dcg’s quite a bit, haven’t tested it but I wouldn’t be surprised if you could do 2 hits with a dcg compared to one hit with all rise.  Couple this with a furious and and 2nd, 3rd etc hits will be doing pretty good damage
---
So then I was at least speaking for you. Why the comment?
---
No, it won't, but it's only a first step. Bethesda themselves said as much in that blog. It's a sign of things to come, and we need to squish the idea before it takes hold.
---
Bet you've never seen a good quilt
---
Random spawn locations in the wild will yield way better stuff if you just get out there and explore instead of farming events that never drop anything about level 40.
---
Here's the guide I used for steel and lead. Look under the section " Let's Go Mining " where he details the route to take to find the ore.

It will be good for some of the higher end food with really nice stat buffs.

If you wants lots of food before then hit things with a bloat fly syringer, then kill the bloat flies that come out with a bloat fly syringer, then kill the bloat flies that come out with a bloat fly syringer. With butcher's bounty, you'll never care about food waste again.

All my excess .38, 10mm and Fusion Cells and junk I don't need that I hoard goes in there. Should up the weight of the stash so I can throw more in

Absolutely, now I can free up the perks I was using for slugger and the rest.

Don't play Survival.

sometimes exploding robot is worse since the body can just get flung away by the explosion, lost loot a couple of times because of this.
---
Yes, Biv gives daily quests. They reset every day at 8 pm eastern time
---
Nice one.  Not sure how many claws you have, they usually just have 2.  Try to get a 3rd one as a mod as it increases the damage.  Think the incisor perk and possibly the “punchy” (can’t remember the name exactly) one helps as well.
---
Canvas mod description:”was held at high hopes, but was a disappointment”
---
You have fun reloading when the first 20 rounds miss and fail to kill me and I’ll have fun breaking your armor with this massive drum mag while your dead on the ground in the process of respawning lol. You bitch made but don’t worry I got one of our mutual friends whose going to join up on you next time he sees you in survival so that I can join your server too ;) and btw neither of your mutual friends have ever seen you in survival yet. It’s going to be hilarious when I screenshot the kill feed and post it here tagging you :D I love to embarrass you keyboard warriors.
---
I strongly disagree with the idea that all corpses should be lootable and all legendaries should go direct to inventory of all participants.
---
The issue is that this will encourage people to AFK the events.  Just load in, hide in a corner, go do something else, come back to free loot.  The last thing 76 needs is to encourage people to just sit and collect free loot; farming Whitespring is already bad enough for the minimal effort required.
---
They could maybe add more of a "buffer" to prevent the legendaries from being one-shot; maybe have their full-heal trigger automatically and prevent death until finished.  I avoid headshotting the 3-stars and ruining loot for people, but if they don't hurry and get their licks in, I'm also not waiting around for them to get off their butts.  You get a big audio warning that a supervisor's spawning, here; there's no reason not to rush him.  I get where you're coming from, but giving people an excuse to be lazy and not contribute isn't a great answer, either.
---
It’s truthfully sad that you are to scared to add me, how’s life living in the safety bubble of the internet? It’s people like you who get their ass handed to them in person when they talk like that 😂
---
I had a third claw mod sitting in my stash from a around launch (idk why I held onto it for so long)
---
But it's come in handy now!
---
And I have the punch perk card(my first ten levels were dark souls deprived style, no armor only fists.) But I don't have incisor, thx for the tips!
---
Is that a jojo reference
---
Turn pacifist mode on in the options unless you want to pvp.
---
Make a water purifier in your camp ASAP to get a stream of water to drink. ( also mutfruit, corn, and tatos for adhesive. )
---
Where you place your camp effects what enemies will attack it / how many. I had one in the Ash Heap ( big gray area on south side of map ) and got attacked by scorch beasts. Now I have it near WhiteSprings ( middle of map ) and I usually only get attacked by a small pack of mole rats or wolves.
---
Prioritize screws and springs as high tier scrap. ( you’ll need a lot to repair weapons and armor )
---
Adhesive and Black Titanium is rare too but you can make a farm for the adhesive and titanium drops from mole people that you can find tons of in the Ash Heap.
---
Around level 30 you can start the quest “Miner Miracles” which will give you excavator power armor. Even though its stats aren’t great, many high level players use it because it gives +100 carry weight without any mods.
---
You can only unlock more mods for a weapon by scrapping copies of it, but be careful as some weapons might not have any mods. It’s also hard to tell if you have any mods left to unlock on a certain weapon as it doesn’t tell you. ( something they’ll hopefully change in the future )
---
If you want to accelerate your scrap gathering, don’t be afraid to capture a neutral settlement on the map. Other players can attempt to take it from you in PvP but this has only only happened to me like 3 times out of the 100+ settlements I’ve taken. Level up scaling and turrets will dissuade most and if you don’t feel like fighting you can just server hop. 
---
Scorchbeasts drop crap loot and are just a waste of ammo and stimpacks. Until you feel like you can kill one without wasting too many resources, I’d recommend just running away from them.
---
When you level up, you can either pick to put a point into a stat or a perk. How many points you have in a stat determines how much of a certain perk you can slot into your build. For example, if you have rifleman level 3 and 3 points in perception, you can equip rifleman into your build but you won’t have enough room for anything else until you level up and put another point into perception. Keep in mind, however, that when you put a point into a stat, you can only keep increasing them until level 50, and after that you can only respec or take a new perk.
---
Last but not least, have fun out there! This Fallout is a lot different from its predecessors but there are still tons of fun environments to explore, loot to gather, quests and stories to find, and adventures to be had!
---
Pc? If so what servers can I find y’all on
---
That's lame. They need to make a zero pvp mode or something and leave the game alone. That's part of the game I like (worrying about my camp). I build secret entrances and strategically place turrets. If it gets too bad I leave the world. I'd just play survival but no fast travel is pretty lame and also lose 2x caps and aid.
---
Yeah it's a total distraction from the core game. I thought we were going to get a proper survival mode. I really hope they change this.
---
Sigh... me too.
---
I like this.  To build on it, I’d like a water-bound society of self-sustaining cruise-ship dwellers, perhaps a number of cruise and freight ships connected by ropes, a few overturned and others still functional - with huts and parts built around them made of whatever floats on by.
---
They farm strange radioactive plants on the water, and just below them, there’s an underwater faction base like Bioshock, with magnets that pulled the cruise ships in to get stuck in the first place.
---
You could have a few tropically-mutated ghouls with water-adaptations, all sorts of sea creatures, and factions like the Parrotheads, a bunch of margarita-fueled Jimmy Buffet lovers.  It’ll be generally chill, but the deeper you get in the ships and underwater and the more sealed hatches deep you go, the more dangerous but the more loaded with loot.  You could have instanced dungeon raids if this is FO76 DLC, and build nice little trash-rafts for a floating CAMP.
---
I feel the same way but I don't even have $15 lmao.
---
i can sell you initiate plan on pc
---
If the Alien Blaster operated at Fo4 damage levels and was available as a legendary drop, it would be the clear option for gunslinger builds.  A furious, anti-armor, instigating or bloodied/25% faster fire or bonus vats crit/15% faster crit meter or weightless blaster would be pretty damn nice.  A big step up from a western revolver, which is the only solid option at the moment.
---
Give it an auto-receiver mod and Guerilla builds might actually exist.  (they'd have to dramatically improve durability on automatic energy weapons, though.)  I tried swapping my western revolver for an automatic laser pistol as a back-up ranged option on my t-51 slugger character, and the thing made unstabilized flux look like ageproof Twinkies.  I might have fired 90 rounds through it before it went from 200% condition to broken.
---
Wtf is West Tek? I also farm at White springs? Level 88 and completely confused about what or where West Tek is, please help.

how can you not recognize takahashi bruh

West Tek is the hospital looking building on the map in the Savage Divide. It’s near the cranberry bog on the edge of the Savage Divide.

True...thank you especially the couple that invited me in to their camp to use the scrapper. Cant remember their names but something 'brole' and 'yeah1xxx'.  I was level 21 and overloaded with junk and no scrapper in sight and hunted by assaultron.
---
That might be a AMD issue. I have a 2080 with a i7 8700 and u play on ultra with 60+fps

As someone who makes a few thousand 5mm rounds a day, no you will not. Everyone who was banned cheated, glitched, or accepted lots of gear from those who did.

If you did glitch or cheat i would suggest you play it safe because you may still be on their radar. Otherwise go to town.

I fast traveled to the event and someone invited me to a group and when they showed up the just fucking murdered everything i didnt get any xp but got lots of loot not sure if i should be upset or happy (i was lvl 34 at the time)
---
I'm on xbox :(( thank you so much though
---
Well said and well written. 
---
I’m personally questioning the verbiage of Beth post where it wrote “unlockable” in atom shop rather then “purchasable” in atom shop. To me that can mean numerous things including “unlocking” a station to make and use normal repair kits. Much like “unlocking” the ability to make costumes within the Armor bench. It’s odd that they use the word “purchasable” when referring to costume recipes but “unlockable” in this post.
---
Droop had a lot of good points.
---
I'm on Xbox abd would be more than happy to help. I'll send you a message when I get in tomorrow
---
That might be fixed when we're able to rename weapons and armour. (Hopefully)
---
As a fellow Brotherhood member, I primarily want fusion cores. Occasionally materials to fix my power armor and heavy weapons but I can usually get those without workshops.
---
It is how it is going to be, because people like you accept it. I didn't say you started it, you're promoting.
---
Two words, Breach and Clear, farm that event every time you see it and hoard as much acid as possible to smelt your wares.
---
I think the science/science expert/science master perks should be condensed into a 5 rank card and apply to energy weapons as a build choice, and behave identically to Gunsmith and Makeshift Warrior.  There's options to be a heavy gunner, rifleman, shotgunner or gunslinger specializing in energy weapons.  Plasma presents a strange problem because it's both energy and ballistic damage, so it would likely have to be reworked to be straight energy damage buffed up a little higher than lasers to make up for the slow projectile speed.
---
and the second.
---
Just did a UF today, same thing, the 3* dropped nothing, the two 2* dropped 1* wood and tire iron. It’s pure comical.
---
Well white springs bunker is an enclave place. Who knows what they have hidden in the hotel.
---
It does, but there isn't any in game to back up the fact that they exist in the Appalachian wasteland
---
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We get it. You've got all the top hats and I don't😂😭 
---
Still, pretty cool seeing 'behind the veil'
---
Omg yes ....this game needs a shared stash in a bad way
---
Plans have to be read, on your pip boy in the the notes section. In display settings put field of vision all the way to the left. Check every container at train stations. Dont horde explosive ammo unless you are going to be using them. Dont be afraid to follow or work with others, you dont have to send a team invite. Id also suggest focusing on a melee build for the early stages even if you dont want a long term melee build.
---
Recently I started to take a pic every time i get a drill or syringer. I will make a gigantic collage of it and surely it will boost the game’s sale for them. Bethesda wants us to rebuild America, with drills and syringers 😂🤮
---
From my testing, this seems to be the case, an not just for Industrial Purifiers.  So the number of purifiers you should use for the best results, is based on how frequently you get by to collect water.  If you stop by your camp or workshop frequently, then you don't need as many, but if you go an hour or more between trips to your camp/workshop, you benefit more from have 5+ Purifiers.
---
Usualy, when I do this event, I always invite to team. Its better that way than trying to fight over loot. That way everybody can get a piece. Unfortunately not everyone are willing to do it.
---
Leaving the board up and removing the marker is a good idea! Having higher bounty rewards for killing the top would be cool too. 1st 300 2nd 200 3rd 100 and maybe some aid or 50 caps an hour depending in your position.
---
It's a bad look, but my way around this is to drink them in my decontamination shower.
---
Whitesprings is not a Event :x And if you are in a full team, you are already able to afk everything. 1 is doing Uranium Fever while 2 others are doing AWOL, while youre sitting in your Camp and craft stuff. You still get the event bonus and absolutely did nothing. Exactly with farming, you -could- just sit around and just pick up everything. Thats actually how many people are doing it. The strongest goes in, kills everything and everyone is picking up their qadrupled legendaries.  
---
Game/Event Participation is something a Game Developer and Programmer should be able to implement very easy. If someone just stands around and actually contributed nothing to the Event (Hitting some enemies, make a decent DPS, Collect Stuff to make the progress bar etc) Something like this is absolut common and a must in MMO-like games. Beth never did such games thats why they probably never thought about that.
---
And yeah as i said the game and events are made just for 4 people, and they never balanced anything in this game thats why almost every event is soloable.
---
Thx
---
Best of luck in your search. I got one paint and a lab coat of some type so far. Stopped counting my turn ins. I tend to go over there once every couple days at this point. For a while I was going after every pick up bacause the tech data doesnt stack and I had no idea if that made a difference. Truth be told, I still dont know. Lol seen so many comments for both sides of argument. I figure I'll get em eventually, so, in the meantime I'll just enjoy the traveling. :D
---
Oh yes. This.
---
You should shoot at their feet and scream “Dance newbie!”
---
Huh, guess there's a few left afterall.
---
I want to get rid of the marker icon above our heads It has helped me kill people and thats the problem lol I'm down with a tagging system but should be aim at them for 3-5 seconds.
---
If you want to be taken seriously I suggest you wait to use that excuse. They haven’t broken anything yet, and despite your amazing logic you aren’t psychic.
---
It’s a ridiculous stretch to call repair kits pay2win, too. I can’t imagine what circumstance would grant you an advantage by buying a repair kit in the store. You obviously can’t do it in the middle of a pvp fight, and if you’re buying them ahead of time you could just make them and save your atom for skins.
---
At launch the exact same thing happened- a minority flooded the subs claiming the next patch would ruin everything. It didn’t.
---
I will hunt down a good source for you tonight or tomorrow.  It is something that came from them.
---
From what I recall the issue is being able to track a certain number of items within a specific region.  This is why scorch beast fights crash a lot when a large number of users and enemies are present. I assume they are tracking by region which is problematic.  In terms of the overall map and server this is also why we have limited stash sizes - object tracking limitations. 
---
Thus the problem isn't the number of players tied to a camp but the size of the camp itself in terms of the number of items.  You could have a larger radius but won't be able to increase the number of things you can build.  But don't take my word on it - let me do a little more research rather than recall and speculation.
---
That is a good theory but that personal life you are talking about has to come out in some way.  It would seem as video games is a good outlet I just wonder how much further it can go with some people.  This has actually been a topic for a long time
---
we will have weapon and armor racks eventually  sometime down the road  after the camp decorating update i'm almost sure of it
---
It will be named "canvas" but it will look like a green hefty garbage bag.
---
I paid someone caps and materials to paint BOS Paladin paint on my T60, I love it :)
---
If you would still have that machine gun i would be interested to trade
---
You can toggle Pacifist off so that your camp is still under threat, I believe.
---
Sadly no I'll be asleep
---
Yes that’s normal. I sometimes tested this with my alt, its vendor inventory is very different from my main character’s. Not sure why this is necessary. Every person’s options is different. 
---
One time when I browsed vendor inventory I saw a whole bunch of legendary weapons and armors. I went to my stash to get something to sell, when I reopened vendor inventory, nada nothing, just bulk junks. Stepped back, tried again, same thing, waited few more minutes, still only junks. After that whenever I see something I like, I make the purchase right away.
---
Definitely keep it.  Furious is an awesome effect for melee, even on medium speed weapons.  Find something 1 handed or unarmed with swing speed and it gets to be almost OP in PVE.
---
Workshops are decent enough resource farms but you can’t keep them (when you log out you lose anything you built on them) and they circumvent any PVP settings you have, any player that wants it or wants to kill you can by simply initiating a claim on it. 
---
Don’t bother trying to build them up more than is necessary to defend them, don’t try to make them your home, and avoid spending your own materials (if the cost is green you are pulling from the workshop recourses, if it’s white you are using yours). 
---
I’d actually suggest just tagging the materials you are looking for instead of using a workshop, either when you are crafting or by going to Inventory &gt; Junk and hitting component view if you have some on you. Every piece of junk containing what you are looking for will get a little magnifying glass next to it, and you can have as many materials tagged as you want.  You’ll build a good amount of most materials in no time, not have to worry about defending yourself from other players or waves of mobs and won’t have your traveling interrupted by defense missions calling you back halfway through a dungeon.
---
It’s not a true post-apocalypse setting without stop sign shields. Totallly necessary for the true Gamma World experience.
---
Ah. Didn't think they'd expire until it was April 9th for everyone. Thanks for the info!
---
Not broken, on purpose.
---
I like your idea but I hope that you can put any skin in the backpack that you want.
---
Not much more relaxing than a few (dozen) shower beers!
---
They do server a purpose of not serving any purpose
---
I learned a thing today
---
I agree, but I think this would add prestige for the weapons that get displayed. There's a difference between a mounted pipe rifle that's there for decoration, and one that's there because it killed 1000 super mutants and has fired 25k rounds.
---
I roleplay as someone playing a single-player game :(
---
I don't have an official name for my character, but he is named "Sir Doot" - he's a Responder. Usually I just run around in Firebreathers gear doing my own thing, although if I see people near the vault below level 10 I usually come by with a care package of 2 stimpacks, 4 diluted stimpacks, a radaway, 2 radaway, and a mix of soups, waters, and foods, sometimes disease cures and addicol if I can spare them
---
another one that pisses me off: collect wood. I don't remember what the first number was, I think it was ..760 wood or something, but is it just wood scraps? Nope, it's collect wood 760 times/press E on logs or firewood amount of times, the reason I don't remember the number is when I _finally_ completed it, I now have: Collect Wood (973/7600) no joke :P
---
Yeah that's what I've decided I'm gonna drop the slider perks in favor for iron fiat and work on getting incisor to 3*
---
I suggest no such thing tho it has been a topic of conversation since the days of the original PlayStation. I am only interested in the people who actually do it and how they do it.  It says something about how their psyche.
---
Thanks bro will be checking domes 👍
---
The one at Flatwoods is unlimited. That's where I put most of my stuff.
---
Late 40s
---
Yeah true! Ok let's go there then
---
Lol. A Brotherhood of Steel faction claims that they are "anti griefer" but just grief anyone that engages in PvP and follows them from server ti server. Anti griefers are just self righteous greifers.
---
I learned something new! Lol  was not aware that your luck perk points also have an impact on the legendary weapons you find.   99% of the legendary weapons / armor i find is crap.
---
My most used weapons are a .50 caliber machine gun (not legendary)  an all rise (bought) and two shot shotgun (bought)   i end up finding useless stuff like two shot gatling or two shot fatman or tire iron
---
I would like to avoid creating my own ruckus with a seperate post. So please.. PLEASE, if you are rolling an Alt and somebody drops a bunch of recipies in front of you. Politely decline the goods with a simple thumbs down.  Most certainly, don't accept them all then invite the person to your group with two level 200 and some friends of yours. 
---
I would get"this is my alt, I don't need any of that" from a simple thumbs down.  Not doing so, only negatively affects new players provides you little to no actual gains and almost certainly defeats the spirit of giving.
---
Thank you for coming to my TT on the power of compassion in the era of Video Games.
---
Depends on what I'm feeling. 
---
My personal character is just a wandering guy who has a little shop. 
---
Sometimes I play as Negan from The Walking Dead if I'm feeling it. It's more of a look than a roleplay though. 
---
I also have a season 9 Rick look I'm working on. 
---
I do enjoy running around as the Cult of Mothman High Priest (Ritual outfit and the barbed bat from the Negan RP) and running up behind low levels. It helps when I have a friend or two to dress up as Guards in Mothman PA paint. Really freaks em out lol
---
Last I heard, player vending has been pushed back a week or two due to a bug with vendor’s inventory since patch 5.
---
what I really hate is trying to kill one but someone is stealthed and kills it first and it blows ME up ...
---
I think player vending will come down to two factors... Low level new player for alts getting cheap legendaries, or high level players that can afford to play around with their build experimenting with different 1 or 2 star legendaries to see if they want to transition permanently to God tier of the same types .

---
Ah ok. I see. I'll have to check that out tomorrow. Thank you!!
---
On the edge of the map, deep in the mire is a small shack. This shack is where a moonshiner makes his vintage Nukashine. If you’re quiet and you follow the twang of the banjo you just might spot the small farm he calls home.
---
No I think they arent allowed to talk about certain subjects they were silent abount the rare parade masks as well
---
You know they don't really much bounce around. If you see where they were, there's only limited places where they can go. I think most of the time if they seem to be hiding, they got on top of a roof.
---
I do a lot of legendary farming hoping for white whales, and I tend to leave 99% of my drops in blue suitcases at train stations around the map (at Whitesprings Station I use the sack next to the tinker's bench).  I leave a lot of one star items with good effects like instigating, furious, bloodied, etc just because I can't/don't hoard everything for myself.  My first "good" legendary weapon was a mutant slayer's/explosive combat rifle that someone sold at Whitesprings, back when explosive was +100% damage.  It served me well for a while.
---
Nah. In this sense we are just helping with workshop defense. No need to follow to another server. That’s toxic and pointless. Ur not helping the player anymore if u chase after a griefer.
---
A trader. My camp is a fully functional shop, with a suite upstairs for players to get a nap and play some music .
---
Mmmm... Commie stew...
---
Game is optimized for shit, if you look in the "wrong" direction(e.g. a direction with a lot of geometry, long sightlines, lots of particle effects, etc.), you will just get low fps.
---
I get 144fps stable in almost all interior cells, but the moment I go outside, I usually get like 50-90, maybe higher depending on where I'm looking.
---
Not really. In a post apocalypse, life is simple and your priorities are clear. You are in control of your life. It's also one of the big reasons that pull people into military careers.
---
that one does have a few starter points on it but could be easily photoshopped out
---
And me buying everyone's dog food.
---
Did you say courier? Do you need a delivery sent?
---
But I’ve seen the guys ur talking about. They actually griefed my bud who had the munitions plant saying he was “only level 30” and “hasn’t played long enough to use that workshop” so I’m taking it upon myself to find some new friends to help the low levels that I have taken under my wing.
---
This is the reason I want an emote for 'hey look I left you some stuff!'
---
Reading all this wholesome shit finna make me cry fam
---
Yup
---
Same here. Started with the beta....told it was fixed...cant hear anything unless a headset is plugged in.
---
I role play as Ezra,  who leaves the vault with his two best friends who are killed by scorched beasts. He barely survives and wanders aimlessly across the wasteland until and stumbles across Fort Defiance. He   follows the trail of holotapes left by the brotherhood and finds renewed purpose: the Queen is an abomination that has to be destroyed and the scorched must be driven into extinction. 
---
He's also determined not to allow dangerous tech to fall into the wrong hands- the wrong hands being some of his fellow vault dwellers who rejected the Brotherhood's ideology and took control of the fusion core producing power plants and an ammo factory.  They  are naive and fail to understand the potential dangers of these technologies and cannot be allowed to possess them and he has no other choice but to take them by force and shedding of blood.  Three of his other former vault tech roommates are on board with him and they set about rebuilding the West Virginia BOS.
---
I will go out of my way to attack "Raiders", but other than that it's just for resources and I don't mind supplying like minded wastelanders
---
You want 1.5k for it?
---
How about C.AM.P. item based, games of chance? I would LOVE to open up a casino camp.
---
I roleplay as myself
---
Whats popular is 3star max level gear. With one of the following: sentinal, swing speed, bloodied,antiarmor,tse and rare plans. With vending alot of people will hit max caps fast meaning prices for things may get higher but the flip side is that when you max caps theyre maxed. So this is where people will have several mules otherwise alot of gear would sit in storage or theyd be giving it away for free since they cant collect caps past max lvl.
---
My character, cautiously waves at everyone. Finger guns pew pew pew when asked to trade because my character has nothing great enough to trade. Waving at players in events to come here and whack the friggin crap out of a legendary to share loot. Misses seeing long neck dogs.
---
I have never noticed this, but I always run up and spam the take item button and sort the shit later.
---
The venus fly traps sound cool but they are only native to south eastern North Carolina
---
My solution? Grab an old pair of headphones you no longer use, snip off the leads, and plug and play. Conversely, get one of those 3.5mm audio cables and connect that. It's a workaround, but it works
---
When you accept Jesus christ as your 1 true god and savior. Thru him all things are possible.
---
Honestly I’m surprised they didn’t add the idea to power armour given it’s suppose to be the replacement for tanks
---
Hmm, might be OK... If anyone even bothers to try and raid bases anymore. Idk seem like there won't be anything to worry about in this "survival" game if they keep going this direction.
---
I have so much dog food.  I'll drop 30 next to the patio chair in Watoga outside of the corner diner where you can get 7-8 each time you visit.
---
I got unban during the huge unban wave and then they never rebanned me... idk man.
---
My player is THE STRANGLER roaming the waste in search of sweet death for any who cross my path
---
www.nukacrypt.com/static/images/fo76worldmap.jpg here ya go buddy
---
Tesla coil on a PA suit can help you tag everything.
---
Same.  If one joins. i FT to them. Drop aid and any other known plans i have for them.
---
Did you find any fix to this?
---
It has to be some kind of glitch. Enemies tend to run if they get crippled or something like that.
---
You need to think more globally. You aren’t even mentioning that to do this you would need people on different consoles and spreading the web to help everyone.
---
I spend a lot of time trying to restock my ammo but I try to help out lower level players when possible, or just other players in general.  The poster right in front of the front door when you enter the house I made for my camp says it best "We're all in this together, mUSt win!"
---
I role play a chaotic neutral generous asshole. Sometimes I give endgame gear, caps, and supplies to random people for free and sometimes I take over workshops just to delete everything and kill the owner. It really just depends on my mood and how the person first reacts to my presence.
---
Do not drink the beer! The beer has gone bad!
---
This is one possible workaround, moving the camp will destroy it though.
---
Sure psn is xSmD_Trance
---
He actually never left me. I saw him following me in the bushes and everytime i encountered a dangerous foe he jumped out from his hiding place and knocked down everyone for me. Right now im sitting on his lap and he is feeding me with mashed corn, that got me to lvl 3.
---
Logan.
---
One of the maybe last alive Brotherhood of Steels Members in Appalachia. He got his old Glory with him all in T60 with a Gatling Laser and a Fatman... but broken and scattered inside. He stumbled across former BOS that more or less dropped there insignia for a more Isolated Life like myself... but someday the Steel maybe back... Time will tell, we will be there and awaits there return.
---
You can rarely get them as a reward for the Messenger event(at least in the Toxic Valley and Forest); however, there needs to be a more reliable way of getting them.
---
But you CAN turn on the light while sitting and in bed.
---
No, that's not normal.
---
Use to not be able to get things like ballistic fiber anywhere but from scavenging. So Bethesda added them to the vendors to help players.
---
Just
---
want
---
Faction
---
items
---
like
---
Flags
---
please.
---
Thats a great idea, what timezone are you in?
---
Yea, that's kinda just a general issue though with moving your camp and blueprints as well. Depending on your build, it simply won't place everything exactly as you had it unfortunately. The tiny little metal sign letters are a nightmare.
---
I have BOS Heavy Combat Armor and its always 81/81 unless I have the sturdy one?
---
Anyway, no other part of the Heavy Combat Armor can beat the Studded Heavy Leather.  The physical resists are lower on the legs/arms.
---
With the balloons? Yeah, that's where my second trip took me. Took a photo as well, haha.
---
No that is normal for players with little dick syndrome.
---
Nah, Rose is a great influence.
---
Gotcha, sorry, I thought you replied to the main thread and I assumed.
---
Since the last update they’ve stopped running away form me!
---
You don't need melee perks, but it does help. Heck a basic fire axe, (super) sledge hammer or other 2H weapon + power armor lets you take down most mobs cheaply. I highly recommend playing in 3rd person mode if you melee.  One more thing, I recommend getting weapon artisan for that 200% durability on repair of weapons. You don't have to keep these crafting perks on all the time, but white knight is recommended if you are having serious issues with materials. 
---
You'll have to do some personal exploration/google fu for armor plan locations, but one of the basic places is right outside whitesprings, at blackwater mine in the shed, and NAR repair yard / big bend tunnel east.
---
I did. They destroyed half my base. Oh well jokes on them it ksnt hard to rebuild what little I had
---
It's close, but not enough blood on it and it could use a few skulls mounted on spikes.
---
When they say they're sorry and won't do it again.
---
Well the good news is there is bunch of people who drop the Lining and also drop paint. The bad news is that it appears you should not bother putting the lottery on.
---
You don't get xp for turret kills, so I don't know what that is
---
Having an advantage over someone because you paid more money than them is pay to win. Period. It can't be any easier to understand than that. If you like pay to win then that is fine. You should stop lying to yourself though. Why should Bethesda ever do anything for the regular players, like increase stash size, when other people will pay for it to get ahead. Pay to win will destroy the game.
---
I'd love to meet these 'nice' high levels. Yesterday I was chased around clarkstown (might have the name wrong, by the waterpark) for over ten minutes by a level 50 in power armour, trying to shoot and stab me non stop while I was using a terminal and walking away. I emoted hello several times and even invited them to trade but they just kept attacking!
---
Your base will get destroyed, by mobs by assholes, it’s just a part of the game, do your best to troll asshats like that back or just ignore them all together, the moment you start to become capable of properly defending yourself is when the fun begins and those type of guys become target practice and free caps  :)
---
or put on ghoulish and regen health from the radiation, and use melee to avoid using ammo all together lol. Good thing the silo has lead in the form of gym weights and robots.
---
You would be surprised how normal that is in several Online Games. League of Legends as Example :)
---
I know, it's just silly that they have to shit all over a weak little guy like me lol. Mist be afraid of a fair fight.
---
Best feeling to ask a level 15 with a team invite then fastravel then trade and offer some stuff for 0 caps. Wave them a good Journey and move on.
---
A lot of them are truthfully, that’s why you still have people wanting to PvP outside of survival as well, they can’t handle it with the big boys!
---
I had a Vampire's Crossbow before...and I've got an All Star Wiffle Bat.
---
Nope. I'm doing just fine...so far.
---
I have a newbie prep kit that I hand out a hunting rifle some ammo 10 bobby pines a bottle of nuka shine and some Leather scraps
---
ps4, but thanks for the offer =3
---
Wow. Wonder what I got downvoted for?
---
I posted the same comment a few weeks ago
---
Great advice, thanks. On the to do list for the next few levels whenever those get done.
---
Really hoping the backpack has more styles than that strange lockbox in the screenshots
---
4 is more than enough. Thanks for the info
---
They will do what they need to do, unless a decision majorly impacts the bottom line BSG will run the business to make the most money. 
---
They are not running a charity. If we want the game to still be around in a few years we need to act less entitled and embrace change.
---
Hahahahahaha
---
That a no from me dog. No way in hell I'm sitting in some "refurbished" torture chair 5 feet from an execution chamber
---
I feel like I must have pretty good luck there because normally people do the "come here" emote and we all get in on the legendaries.
---
Rip
---
"you're acting entitled, expecting the company to keep it's word". That's where we are now? Wanting a company to stand by what it says is fucking "entitled". What's wrong with you?
---
I doubt it I have around 200k ammo on my toon and have had no problems. I dont use mules so when I am max on caps I buy ammo as a way of storing currency.  Fyi .45 rounds and a few other ammo weigh zero when perked.
---
I hope for your sake its not addressed in the patch thats less than 12 hours away.
---
You’ve not tried very hard then. I picked up my key for £16 last November from a uk cd keys company online. That’s five months ago 😶
---
Surely google would help find something in your location?
---
Mine is doing this rn! Been bumped off 3 servers and had 3 ghouls invisible 🤦‍♀️
---
True, but we’re talking about a fucking *videogame* here, are we not? I don’t see what makes investing time any more inherently legitimate than investing money. Both are currencies some have more of than others.
---
Honestly,
---
Today I kept spam taunting at a level 400 and shooting at him and instead of killing me he just dropped plans and walked away.
---
As you like, no point continuing this as we have a different outlook on business.
---
Peace ✌️
---
You’ll still die in two hits from anything, tse or not.
---
Thats a false hope
---
All you need is a junk resource at your camp. You’ll be swimming in screws in no time.
---
Hurray for Knowledge! :3
---
Not true because I had one and has no pool of screws lol
---
I find that AWOL is easier too.   AWOL does not have radiation.
---
I can stealth kill Col Gutsy before it comes out of caution state in the wider open area without getting close to the things.   Only the legendary bots, do I actually start taking any damage.   
---
With the mine, gotta run around back and forth killing stuff or keeping on the walkway above, but harder to hide in there and always going to be in range to get hit.
---
Amazing! This brought a long lasting smile to my dull face. 👍
---
Every duper shalt be punished by a firing squad using the very weapons they created
---
After that they'll do an unban wave
---
Feel free to share your exploits on r/falloutraiders . I'd love to hear some pvp tales over an old possum at my camp.
---
How did this destroy your memories? Surely the memories are still the same memories. Is this like when toys r us closed and suddenly everyone’s childhood as toys r us kids are now sad?
---
Wrong attitude to playing the game will end up with this happening. It’s just a game, rebuild something even better with all the experience you now have.
---
It’s just pixels 👀
---
Yes every time. I expect to be randomly attacked by 3 berserk SBs suddenly at any moment, like every other time.
---
Camp McClintock - Clip boards galore = Screws! Yay  
---
Sugar Grove: Clipboards as well = Screws! Also Yay!
---
Thnx imma check there out
---
If you shot Sentinel Assassin's guy 50 times, then you are missing a very important perk:  Tormentor.   If you had that, it would have died shortly after the stagger triggered.
---
If you’re desperate to play, start a new account and buy the game again. Otherwise- this is a valuable lesson for many people.
---
Tormentor Perk for rifles.
---
and having QoL over none plaing player is not advantage, then what is it?
---
It would be sad, if your 'escape from reality' was alcohol and drugs in real life.
---
Liking an atmospheric video game is not sad.
---
I'm having this mask. How much do you give me?
---
sorry I tried to wait as long as I could I live in the other side off the world and im 6 hours ahead  off you, RL got on the way last night.
---
yes I am interested to buy one from each serum. 
---
I will try again today to link up with you.
---
Sneaking hides your marker on the map.
---
We get to rename weapons and armor. That’s what I’m looking forward to.
---
I feel like I've only been able to even have 1 at a time for like 3 patches.
---
I mod the hell out of level 1 pipe weapons and leave them on the bodies right outside vault 76
---
Kittens in a barrel, everyone is a kitten, everyone’s in a barrel.
---
Just give everyone in survival a vault suit and a knife with no other weapons available, just building junk and some aid.
---
Everyone would be equal and not show on the map, hunt, kill, survive.
---
When my stash and character is completely full. I find a lvl 20. Make them a full set of deep pocketed lvl 20 leather.  And drop all my known plans and low lvl 1 ad 2 star stuff. Also a set of lvl 25 excavator
---
You're over-relying on personal experience and ignoring obvious facts. There's no way to negate 100% armor. If you plug some numbers into the DR calculation it becomes obvious that DR isn't really doing much if you have the damage to break past it. DR plots as an S curve as a function to damage taken. Everything damage reduction (assassin/sent/cav/perks) is flat. The biggest issue in all of this is power armor doesn't have an explosive damage reduction mod like every other armor piece does. This means you go from negating explosive damage entirely to only negating 45%. These are some of the most common weapons in the game because of duping, so you're choosing a really, really pervasive vulnerability. 
---
The offensive advantages still do not outweigh the defensive draw backs. But if you think getting that armor pen and choosing to have explosive vulnerability, reduced stealth viability, slower turning and movement speed, no % damage reduction armor, and a larger hit box - go ahead and rock out. Best of luck to you
---
Haha my guy i'm the same, i'm always crouch walking until i hear gun shots, an i track them down and look for defend workshop events then i hunt, most of the time i play with people, just shooting them an doing a little damage, them i follow them for a while, i've had a few people quit when i haven't even killed them. It's so much more fun hunting than waiting
---
My brother has two different ones but I don't know which ones they are.
---
Sorry but what is "WS" ? Watoga Street ?
---
Wow.
---
My teammate really wants this. He wants to eat the cram right off the shelf and keep moving. I think it’s a great idea.
---
Good luck mate.
---
Whitesprings
---
Agree. The vault suit. And whatever you can find, build or steal. Zero ties to your current pool of caps. No direct vendors.
---
Love it, take my point. hope it gets viewed by the devs. Hear this guy out.
---
So a two doc turn in is only available once per character?
---
My nuka quantum collection from dead players begs to differ
---
Workshop defense events normally just end up being fast travel points for people to come murder you. Happens almost every time at the ammo factory. With you 100%.
---
just make more empath serums and drink one whenever you need to suppress the side effects
---
This right here. I drink serums for mutations I already have all the time.
---
SugarGrove, has to be close to 20 fans and clipboards in that place.
---
Same unless they're the rarer ones.
---
It’s a spin off with no npcs. Just learn to cope, alright? You’re not getting any npcs (except the occasional robot or special vendor)
---
thank you for the info,
---
I had a camp here for a while was good fun sitting on the porch with the water and that view
---
Last time I had a Tough Guy Tom show up at my door. I had just given like 10-15 low level legendary items to a girl on mic. About 10 minutes late TGT comes out of nowhere. Starts screaming at me because I’m a creep for interacting with his gf. He tries to shoot my house and somehow misses with his Bloodied explosive Shotgun. I flash the heart emote cuz there was a deathclaw charging him. And since his like level 40 he drops like anchor. Karma is bliss. 
---
Those people exist. Don’t worry about them.
---
After the Unstoppables' Event in February, I've been wary and seriously hoping nothing like that would crop up again. Here's hoping the gut feeling was wrong; I guess we'll see.
---
I like aspects of Survival. No fast travel? Love it. Can't see anyone on the map? Great. The idea that if you can come up to someone and you catch them unaware, you can take them out? Amazing. Dropping aid stuff on death, even better. 
---
I just don't like the leaderboards showing the top three people. Leave everyone hidden. And maybe make the spawn zones where you can't spawn kill people or something. That needs to be reworked.
---
Lol looks like a big post full of shit talk from some moron mad that I proved him wrong. You can’t even admit you were wrong either. What a pathetic scrub. And cool let that mutual friend put you in my world, and if he hadn’t seen me in survival yet he either has me confused with someone else or is blind.
---
If I have to give up a weapon just because it's been used however many times I'll die lol.
---
Yongyea /s
---
I had one run from me today
---
Maybe you lost it, maybe you screwed up and didn’t notice. The latter happens all the time. Must more than the former.
---
I run a rifle build and don't even run class freak. Granted there's certain mutations I can't run (scaly skin, in particular), but the perk eats up too many luck points without any substantial returns. 
---
It's really not that expensive to craft serums whenever you want to suppress the side effects. Even if you run out of flux, I've bought flux from players at 100 cap per.
---
Not true, like at all. I’ve got about 800 hours in the game and can tell you that your observation is flat out false.
---
Speaking of downvotes and upvotes, clearly no one ever agrees with you since you have a whopping 40 something karma after over 40 days on here. That just shows you speak nothing but bullshit and misinformation, which no one agrees with. But keep lying to yourself kid.
---
If you can get to them. They suddenly pop up, and go back down in an instant. That said, I barely use vats, mostly to scan for enemies that I don't see.
---
I am usually up rather early every day to feed the baby, and during that precious solo quiet time I can masturbate or play fallout. Problem is, none of my friends are on until after work.
---
So I like to meet low players, bs with them a bit, and if they are truly new players I offer to take them around to all the cool "secret" spots I've found like the 3 domes, the space station, the costume place, and cemetery and so on... so they can get some neat stuff and I jump around to all the traders I use for my sale run, and give them all the known plans I've picked up. 
---
Makes me feel like I am less of an asshole, I sell when I FT anyway, and I make allies who have saved me from death on a few occasions during nukes when I try stupid stuff. 
---
I will never understand why people feel the need to be a dick online. Being nice feels nice... anyway I'm high 
---
TL;DR I love helping out newbies, what goes around comes around.
---
Then you would get two mates killing each other to farm caps
---
I had a guy try and help with the math on this a few weeks ago. I think it's like this.
---
Sentinel and Lone Wanderer
---
0.85 \* 0.85 \* 0.85 \* 0.85 \* 0.85 \* 0.70 = 31% Damage Taken
---
Sentinel and Assassins and Lone Wanderer
---
0.85 \* 0.85 \* 0.85 \* 0.85 \* 0.85 \* 0.7 \* 0.92 \* 0.92 \* 0.92 \* 0.92 \* 0.92 = 20% damage taken
---
As pointed out below there are other perks like serendipity and dodgy which don't factor into the % taken but make you even more invulnerable. Serendipity works well and means around half of the attacks don't land, but you need to be below 30% health.
---
I would love to see giant bosses. I remember back in FO4 someone made a mod with a godzilla-sized deathclaw and other giant beasts. I really like that idea! But they should have some mechanics involved, so they dont become all only bulletsponges like SBQ.
---
I had a lvl 89 shoot me for no reason when I was lvl 4. Turned it off after that. 
---
I want to give it another try but with busy schedules it's my low priority game.
---
If I were a betting man (I am btw) I don’t think it’s out of the question. As it currently stands it’s full of ridiculous cheese, and a simple “new character only” lock would solve 95% of the modes issues.
---
Watoga suitcase is my drop point. I found so many in there at lower levels, so I pay it forward.
---
Fingers crossed it doesn’t take a lot of budget, I don’t have a lot of spare atm lol
---
This.
---
Capture a workshop, do it’s defend mission, move to the next workshop: repeat. Start in the bog or mire, there’s more and better enemies. You’ll also be flush with things like stimpaks and ballistic fiber if you do this, the quest rewards are simple but very useful.
---
500 atoms is five dollars, not fifty.
---
lol. I must have been really tirred last night. Ill take the post down. Thanks :-D
---
I can firmly tell you I haven’t spent $ on this game besides the $200 for my edition and the $120 for the fiancée and  a friend. The atom Price is definitely pricey, and I’ve just decided to grind in game for all my atoms. I also just wait until they make stuff free.
---
Overall, with the in game atom earned I think I’ve bought two different floors on sale, the moth man statue, and the Nuka cola chest on sale. Still sitting around the 2,600 mark. But, that’s like 400 hours of gameplay.
---
But I like the leader board, wish it was through points (infamy if you will, like killing mobs or people instead of time of survival). You do enough to warrant the attention of others on the server you should have some sort of flag.
---
Again you ignore the fact you were downvoted multiple times on almost all of your original comments lmfao keep talking bitch boy this is hilarious
---
I would join survival for exactly this
---
Depressing watching the potential of this game flush down the toilet. I'm firmly against this unless it's a plan for crafting and unlocked via play as well as pay.
---
Considering how elder scrolls online listened to the community and turned itself around into a fairly decent game I expected more from Fallout 76.
---
Lately I have been wearing power armor and I got a Legendary Serrated Combat knife with +40% speed (and 30% damage against robots. Its my robot serial killer knife) so I just use the knife and stab them a few times for a good chunk of damage and to aggro them so I can lead the miners to the middle of the room.
---
If you can't get them from there then snooze you lose.
---
Of course... thank you !
---
Not sure how many signs you want in the bundle but a sure fire way to ensure the bundle will appear in the Atom Shop will be to first buy half of the items you want at full price. The bundle should drop almost as soon as you do and you’re out of Atoms.
---
Thanks buddy
---
Killing people would work.. maybe launching a nuke.
---
Just not survival.
---
I see so many mothmans here also lol. Ive been attacked by two vengeful ones and come across 2 others that just vanished after i moved near them
---
I've never heard of it either, I can't wait to see it. Sounds cute. :p
---
I like it. I'd give 1h weapons a nieche to fill. They're pretty useless right now.
---
Uh, yeah. That's kinda the most well known spot. But always good for new players.
---
My character is an aspiring Brotherhood Knight. Born and raised in Vault 76, she never knew the world before the bombs, but deeply regrets living a safe, cushy life while survivors struggled outside.
---
Although the Brotherhood of Steel was long gone by the time she left the vault, their sacrifice in the war against the Scorched inspired her to carry on their ideals.
---
She spends most of her time alone, but hopes to one day bring together her fellow vault dwellers under the banner of a new Appalachian Brotherhood.
---
In a non persistent world, with always 24 random players that probably dont even know what reddit is you wouldn't really benefit out of that. The caps cost are very high for every camp movement and getting even higher the more you are doing this in one play session. Only your friendlist would be able to join your world constantly and they can't really see or dont care that you moved your camp, because they just fast travel to you.
---
Would be awesome with a huger playerbase in one world and a persistent world that actually last longer than a play session with players you see everyday.
---
I thought clipboards just give springs not screws?
---
Yeah it kind sucks how many copper/concrete spots their are, especially in the Forest. I'd love to have a few of the places as a base, but just can't put myself on a concrete spot, ugh. lol.
---
I applaud your effort. The usual people are still going to ask all those things, though &gt;&lt;
---
I never leave my mansion in the cranberry bog - it’s hella cosy
---
When I mean move camp after awhile I mean after like 3 irl days and only move to high traffic. Areas that way people don't need reddit to see you have a shop (signs and stuff telling then it's a shop) and with the people that do have reddit I can post on here my new stock and such
---
No I wasn’t lol, go back and look, you’ve been downvoted me than I have. You seem to have a real issue accepting facts and reality, make you should see a therapist.
---
Player markers needs to be removed
---
Yeah, I don't understand why we can't bulk certain things. We can bulk springs, but not screws? I don't know about you, but anytime I buy screws they're usually bulked in a box, so why can't we bulk them in the game? Same goes for gears, gold, crystal shards, and many other items. It's not like bulking them  changes the weight of our stashes, so why prevent us from bulking them?
---
I don't think it matters where they put it, it's going to end up a hub with tons of people in and out. It's gonna be laggy, even if they stuck it in some corner. 
---
I don't really like WS as the spot, I think it should be in the forest near either Flatwoods or Morgantown, so lower levels can get to it easily.
---
just tried bravo .it didnt work..have they rolled over? if so..how long till the next one gets solved approx?
---
This would be so awesome.
---
I can’t remember, but can Sally in Mothership Zeta give you  for it? She probably just gave you Alien Power Modules for the other alien guns.
---
Man, I loved Mothership Zeta. And Fallout 3 in general. I wonder what happened to the Lone Wanderer...
---
After doing some googling, I have seen reports that the Fallout 4: The Capital Wasteland mod project is on the rails again. Oh joyous day.
---
What's the point, in Adventure you wouldn't be able to hurt anyone anyway?
---
We should be able to find sheet music out in the world to learn new/different songs.
---
Again you are strawing manning me NEVER said its a nice thing to do saying it should be allowed.If I think that horror movies should be less scary does that mean horror movies should be made less scary? No because the purpose of them is to be scary. If you think fallout should not be a survival game and have player choice because its not nice does that mean they should change the genre and what the game is? No. Get thicker skin or don't play the game. Case closed end of story as you've demonstrated you are incapable of rebutting those claims.
---
The chrome paint is going to be limited time, calling it
---
The good looking stuff lasts two fucking days while we keep the ugly stuff
---
Depends on the day, depends on the outfit.
---
Right now, bob the builder; failed tv show host turned vault dweller turned alcoholic.
---
He goes around the water in his steelworlers hat and outfit wielding his all rise super sledge.
---
Sometimes he fixes, other times he breaks. The hooch determines that now.
---
Tomorrow? My alt Sam Beckett hoping that the next leap will be his last ^and ^he ^gets ^the ^civil ^war ^top ^hat ^plan
---
You're welcome mate.
---
It just reset so it may take some time to get the new code
---
Free states: plans weigh nothing and are 10% cheaper when buying from a vendor or junk has reduced weight and get uncommon items from scrapping. 
---
Raiders: bonus xp/more caps in pvp, higher chance to find better condition on weapons and armor, or crafting melee and pipe weapons is cheaper.
---
I'd also like it to be you can only have 1 faction backpack. Like you belong to 1 faction (and you have their backpack) and when you level up, you have the additional option of choosing a new faction, which switches your backpack type automatically. 
---
Once you complete a faction quest line, you unlock the ability to join said faction. This would give completing each quest line a little more meaning, considering you just spent the whole thing learning about the entire faction.
---
I know this is all random ideas, but it's getting me excited just thinking these up.
---
It works perfectly for us. It's in the middle of the night so it's all done and dusted by the time you wake up.
---
Hope there are not to many bugs though - never know what to expect.
---
Let me guess: You were fighting the deathclaw at the Thunder Mountain substation just north of Watoga, and the cowardly lizard ran southeast, towards where the Gutsys like to hang out on the highway there? Because I've had that chase a few times myself.
---
im lvl 102, and when im luck i got 1 to 3 hours off play ah day. I ussially lvl 1 to 3 times a day. but I do events/workshops and kill everything I see, and ussually drop a nuke as well a few times a week that helps a lot as well.
---
Clipboards are springs. Sugar Grove is a good source of fans, as well as the computer room in the Whitespring bunker
---
I feel highly confident that there will be ZERO chance of you getting npcs in this update (minus a unique robot aka an npc. The complainers don’t seem to get this). 
---
It’s a game without (many) npcs (except for all those robots, and the super mutant, and the precorded quest givers, and BIV). One Game. Learn To Cope. 
---
...but if they do appear, every last one better be marked Unessential. That was a Fallout hallmark from way back. So a griefer can run his chainsaw right by your ear through their entire conversation and cut him down right when he was about to tell you what you wanted to hear.
---
There's also a lot of interesting game-lore there. I suggest exploring it and making a point of reading all the terminal entries while you're at it.
---
Baaaaah humbug
---
....I must be cursed because I find legendary enemies everywhere always... today I found three legendary scorched, was not aware that was a thing outside events.
---
I'm on Xbox I'll try to catch you when I'm on sometime GT: Sarukan
---
Unfortunately, yes. I think patch 9 is slotted for May 23 (legendary vendor), but I could be mistaken. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
---
Last time I played Survival, I could never find the top 3 on the leaderboard. They just didn't seem to be on the map at all.
---
Assuming and bluffing are two different things pal. Also how does one bluff when assuming? What’s there to be bluffing about exactly?
---
It’s like some people just type some random nonsense and then say “yup looks good” and post it, even if it makes zero sense.
---
Truth is, the game was rigged from the start
---
Neat, cool idea.
---
Hoping so.. Last few updates, I had forgotten to set my XB to auto download updates.. So there were a few times I had to wait patiently.
---
I found a ton at WV Lumber Co. yesterday!
---
Isn’t tickle duster a sex position?
---
I have friends that run full zealots and dont take damage from the queen....
---
What's your GT? I farm encounters a lot and get him frequently, I'll message you if I do
---
Is this game worth buying yet ???
---
Which platform are u playing ?
---
It’s fine Bethesda just wants to ensure I get a heart attack early in life...
---
I haven’t paid enough attention to it to answer, but maybe you have a chest with low energy resistance and that’s why it’s breaking down it’s durability so fast? Just a guess.
---
Ooo yeah. That's one of the more popular locations.  
---
I had a small camp there once.  
---
When it wasn't able to be placed, I went to see what awesome camp could be there. People normally build really neat stuff in neat places... but no...
---
It was a floating base. Not a creative one, not interesting or anything - just single foundation, staircase, and one huge block of building.
---
What the fuck.
---
i think this post is silly because you can just suicide and then your ranking drops down, I don't understand why you are complaining about being hunted on a pvp server, you can also sneak to remove your icon, this isn't day z stop trying to turn it into that. If you want to play day z go play day z ?
---
 cant see the pic, maybe thats the reason.
---
Lmao laaaame. Yeah ive seen some real gems there for sure looking online and such. People are so creative
---
By all means, it’s only got two levels as that’s as high as it’ll let me build but I’m still pretty happy with it
---
Can I have that grenade launcher?? Lol
---
Lol you must be blind, and stupid. You would definitely need a therapist if you accepted my friend request and stopped being a little bitch lmao
---
Don't start in survival mode
---
Same!
---
no its not, I had something similar happened but the other way around, me and 3 other buddies of mines found a low lvl and decied to help him, he was ok and then he turned into a little dick . long story short we nuked his camp, justice FO76 style.
---
Low levels at watoga? Jesus. I’m level 46 and only recently went there haha. Killed my first schorched beast yesterday too. Truly avoided anything too hard until my character was ready.
---
Then guess what back to square one. Everyone killing people in adventure mode. Besides pvp was a bit more competitive in adventure. So i welcome it
---
Thirty years ago, nerds had to go outside. That's were the Radio Shacks, software stores, and arcades were.  These days, with the right set of skills &amp; interests, "shut-in" is a viable lifestyle choice.
---
Each special stat already functions like a perk in certain ways. They all have stronger effects the higher they are. Int gives you more exp. Wish I had 15 int, I’ve run the whole game with essentially 1 (thanks to Marsupial).
---
thnx
---
Vats crits do always hit, even if it says 0% chance and they just went behind a wall, it’s a guaranteed hit.
---
Source: 1300 hours game time, 100’s killed through walls with vats crits.
---
Yes, helping out new players is an amicable action, but how do you know they are new?  
---
Plenty of players create an alt or two, how do you determine an alt from a new player?  
---
Being altruistic is great, but beware the leeches in life, those who will take all they can but do not return the favour.  
---
But in the end, it should be a case of, treat others how you want to be treated not how you are treated.
---
Happens in Watoga, too.  
---
Terrified me when the game killed a legendary right outside Phoenix’s shop. 
---
Broke my heart when it happened to the vendor bot out by Lady Janet’s.
---
Because of the times that I've been attacked by a player who one-shotted me well away from the workshop when his team mate contested the workshop at the same time across the map. Yes I have hold workshops without problems, but I have also suffered for it and the negatives outweigh the positive for me.
---
Not for you, no.
---
No, thanks. I was looking to be a courier.
---
I don’t think it’s reasonable to hope for something like this, but I’m with you. I just want two more special points. Oh, the things I could do with just two extra special points.
---
What system are you on? I have issue 1.
---
I do that too. When I was around lvl 30 I got something like 25 plans all at once from there, since then, I always put what I find in that same trunk.
---
There might be a different way to do it but the way they work in FO4 they are a performance killer.
---
You really don't want potentially 24+ camps in the server with a bunch of those.
---
Specially the ones that support poses - thus requiring a bunch of papyrus scripts to work.
---
Mannequins - the ones that allow you to 'dress' them - are NPCs that have been told to 'stay put' via papyrus script.
---
They murdered the performance of my settlements to death by clogging the papyrus VM.
---
It depends on when you left. Soon after release? The Bobby Pins Episode? Either way, move one spot forward to the answer which is, unfortunately, it depends on you. Read some recent (as in the last few) patch notes, watch the Wild Appalachia trailer, and read a few Inside the Vaults and see if you're happy with what's coming for the game. Then play it for yourself.
---
If you didn’t like the gameplay loop then it’s still the same
---
If you didn’t like the bugs then they’re sorta the same, still lost a fuckton of gear
---
But you might like it
---
Yeah I pull out a flamer ... but it isn't that great of an event w/ the level cap.
---
Because you were one of them :D
---
Second character is a civil war union soldier ( at least till I level up high enough to use the black powder guns o have)
---
I’m on PS4
---
Try 116306005. If that doesn’t work I don’t know what to tell you.
---
Which one? The auto or M79?
---
I stalk low level players and shoot near them
---
Till they are frozen in fear!!!
---
Then I give them a couple starter guns around their level, stim packs, and ammo. Also an extra outfit if I got it. Gave a few newbies some extra hunters long coats when I was farming that vendor.
---
There is a reason to have high intelligence. Each point increases XP earned from kills by 2%, with a hard cap at 25 int. CHA does the same thing at 5% per point for quest and event XP rewards. Try it before you deny it!
---
My Vault Dweller is Ashton Garvey. Decorated police officer with three bravery awards. Seeing the dilapidated state of the world, and people barely managing to survive, he wants to start a group that will help people rebuild, and provide safety against Appalachian threats. A group that will protect people at a minute's notice. In his favorite garb: a Western Duster and a Ranger Hat from his pre-war days, Ashton goes around helping people build CAMPS and start farms. Wanted to move to the Commonwealth after retirement but the War happened.
---
New camera is April 16 unless I missed something in ItV. There's also Ever Upwards coming in early May. Player vending will either be May 7 or May 23.
---
I’ll carry you bro
---
Patch 9 will be April 16 most likely.
---
Ah ok, i was wrong thanks👍
---
Lol again I’m not stupid enough to fall for that trick. And you know good and well I’ve whooped that ass before, keep running your mouth, hell even after I find and destroy your ass in survival I guarantee you will still be here talking shit and making up bullshit and lies.
---
Oh and are you ever gonna admit you were wrong about the perforating magazine? It doesn’t take a fool to realize someone that can’t admit they are wrong is someone that constantly lies to themselves to make themselves feel better, aka someone oblivious to reality, like your pathetic self.
---
Doesn’t work for stashes only on player.
---
I do what I can. I had a high level beneficiary when I first started, so I try to do pass it on. I just gave a level three like 550 rounds of 556 ammo and a bunch of extra plans.
---
Not really... everything is fine here
---
It's not supposed to work in the stash.
---
Last few hours of the game being non pay to win.
---
I don't remember them saying repair packs were coming in this patch
---
It’s believed that there will be more logs. As such the quest isn’t complete yet.
---
Thank you 😵 much to look forward to here
---
It is.
---
They could buy legendaries legitimately. Duped ones.
---
*Oh didn’t know that, thank you!*
---
*I hope that Bethesda make the Elder Scrolls 6 a* ***single*** *player game!*
---
Anyone ever read Soul Music by Terry Pratchett?
---
My concept is a Witchy type with a shop like that....
---
The in the vault that they mentioned them in specifically says "in the weeks following patch 8" which means they aren't coming tomorrow
---
Have a downvote for saying “your studio doesn’t do much but players do”. Lol yeah, yeah you sitting on your ass all day playing a video game is really impressive. The mind boggling hubris of the average reddit gamer is astounding. 
---
Did you do something cool in game? Guess what, you pressing a couple buttons doesn’t remotely compare to the energy, creativity, and human effort put in way before you came along.
---
I know, i just want to declutter my pip boy screen!
---
Blackbird.... I would die for that...
---
We can only have 5?
---
Honestly just build your camp near a junk pile. Put s resource collector and profit.
---
Deathclaws are really bad in open space which is where I think most people find them. Slow and always alone. They're mostly a terror in closed spaces like caves which is also where they're often scripted to appear.
---
Gulpers on the other hand are pretty much the deathclaws of open space. Quick and always in packs. Same with crickets. Both are tanky and quick, and most importantly they're in packs.
---
My psn is ibiza4me

But it would be easier on our discord

Wendigos drop 5-9 screws.
---
I thoughts that what the legendary vendor was gonna be. But with tokens instead of caps.
---
Ive always given to low level players as did high level players helped me out in times of need. I always give my loot away but i sometimes wonder are they a super rich mule or an actual low lvl new player???
---
Oh i missed that, so you scrap legendary items to get tokens, and then you use them to re-roll the stats?
---
The M79, I jest tho. It’s a nice weapon, but I prefer to find gear in game rather than fishing on reddit.
---
Lmaoo Fallout games are NOT for people with busy schedules. These games aren’t as fast paced and NEED time in order to be enjoyed to the fullest
---
Excellent stuff OP. The number of three stars for that amount of farming is staggeringly low.
---
It also really shows the rarity of cavalier and sentinel pieces. You got one sentinel and two cavaliers out of all that farming.
---
Yeah.
---
Check this out.

This is brilliant!!! Imma look you up this weekend.
---
My only thought...why give tier 0 a consolation prize but give tier 1 absolutely nothing??? At least tier 1 did better than 0
---
Sorry for the post then, i was figuring out how would work the new merchant on may, but i didnt know that he worked that way
---
Atm you can buy the game from cdkey stores at around 9 euros and run two games in one pc for easy storage characters and extra character slots.
---
I dont' see increasing of cap as a good idea, if (when) new way to dupe will be found (or roll required effect from new legendary trader, or something else, you got the idea) - and market polluted again, only legitimately farmed items will be affected, and only honest people harmed.
---
It would be nice by with the ghost of 'live services' permeating the entire industry... I don't know.
---
Either way as I said there might be another way to make 'dressable' mannequins that is less taxing, I don't know, but the way it was done in FO4 - and I believe Skyrim too which is why if the papyrus VM went 'funny' people would see the wretched things move - would be murder for the server unless they imposed a hard limit (like with turrets) of 2 or 3 per CAMP.
---
Yeah I created a post for the same issue. Im still having major problems with that. around 6 out of 10 trades it doesnt allow the other player to accept my trading request. And they cant even send me a trading request, as the icon doesnt appear for them.
---
The weird thing is that me, I always see the trading option on them,I hit Y and sometimes they can accept, sometimes not. but the other players dont always have the Y trading option on me. I mean, it's not reversable, I can always accept a trade request when someone has the icon and asks for a trading. Never happened that I don't see the Y icon to accept it. I really cant understand.
---
Its hard to explain in another language, sorry
---
You both will have tons of fun. My boyfriend introduced me to this game. We play together and with a few others and have a nice squad to run around the Wasteland with.
---
I'm aware of that, I put huge hours into FO4 and throughly enjoyed it, just having my work undone on this one by a bored high lvl was very demotivating to play
---
Can only do what I can do on Xbox. I’m not looking to run an organization. Just looking for people that’ll help. I get the whole global thing, but I can only worry about griefers on Xbox ya know?
---
Always fight SBs in power armor, unless you find a piece of dense chest armor.  Get the fireproof perk.
---
Sadly not. Actually not playing FO76 that much anymore. They adding pay to win doesnt motivate to do so too.
---
I think it’s improved. It’s got more content, and most of the aggressive players are in the new survival mode. Today’s patch will (hopefully) bring a much needed boost to the economy. Plus the servers seem to have stabilized since the initial launch. It’s up to you though.
---
Good luck to you. Out of nearly 200 drops I would use almost none of these.
---
I couldn’t imagine trying to farm for a whole set of a specific armour with those effects.
---
You could always hop online, do a few quests, and then make a decision whether to continue playing or not. Yet again, it’s up to you.
---
 Already 100 strong on r/ falloutraiders. Join us over there and close ranks on these enclave fools
---
Whitesprings. Every fan, typewriter, toy truck, toy car, silver/gold locket... Lots of resources, not to mention the obvious...
---
the old one's were full of rich story telling. Great NPCs and really entertaining quests. So all of this is missing. There are no NPCs in the whole world.
---
If by making this post, it sparks people on other consoles to do the same, great. But I have a full time job and not enough time to run an organized effort in purging griefers. I’m trying to find people  that are willing to help low levels while they’re farming or doing other stuff. U see a low level getting attacked at his workshop, I want veterans to feel obligated to help them. That’s what this is about. I can’t start up a huge movement, all I can do is help those I see struggling.
---
Me too, although I also sometimes put them in the med box by the entrance to the trading area in flatwoods. I figure there’s no reason to go back to overseers camp but I find myself still going back to flatwoods regularly
---
Nice to see shitposts coming back on this sub.
---
Not for me :'( I get home from work after 11pm and usually play for a few hours. The recent daylight savings swap over has just made this worse too.
---
Fr
---
I've got a few. My main is a Vault dweller who was vault security in 76. He only uses a 10mm pistol and a baton. I have an old grizzled BoS Medic named Doc and an Enclave officer who specialises in heavy weapons.
---
My name is Uther was a plumber in training when the bombs fell, dad was head of the union, had connections with white springs and got me in with a few favors. I enjoyed becoming head plumber got to learn all about the reactor.  Did not want to leave the vault at first but now I found my father. 
---
I put him down with a swing of my serrated rev sword and buried him next to maw. Still looking for my sister.  I joined my old mans unit.  The Big E he called it. Found his old camo short bdu after I made my general. There is nothing more that I want to rebuild our great land and lead us to a golden age maw use to dream of. 
---
Been mostly a loner for now found a few nice folk that have help me and I return the favor in kind. I love the radio but wish some of radio stations I listened to as a kid would come back to the air waves. Well I've got to make a few brews and stims to final head to the silo. LATES.
---
\--close
---
Almost! But I came from Watoga, so he went north.
---
Nah you're good bud. Currently dealing with a burnout and this game helps me immensely with recovering (:. Enjoy your time here!
---
Potentially so. But, we most likely won't be able to set up our vending maschines inside and regular nukes will evaporate whatever player structures remain outside.
---
You must be honest this looks pretty funny. I have not expected that dedication and got my laughter out of this video :D Thx man
---
I do that often as I find my stash box is almost always close to full, so I take all weapons ammo and junk I don’t need and go to the vault, wait for something to emerge from it and tell them over mic basically “I don’t need any of this stuff, if you have use for any of it help yourself.” Sometimes they do, sometimes they run away like it’s a trap or something lol
---
It's low priority for them . 
---
But don't buy another copy if your still banned. That's exactly what Bethesda wants you to do
---
&gt;I would not use it, I need every space for my lovely CAMP.
---
&gt;&gt;I don’t use turrets either, I found myself a good CAMP spot with low leveled enemies.
---
🙄 it is and it isn’t. I fought people who withstood extreme fire down to zero hp but won’t die. I’ve killed and been killed a million times in less than two seconds. More like half a second. And in my 800 hours I’ve seen a lot more of the latter.
---
Well, I TRIED to make something cool.
---
And yeah, I admit being salty, since I've had this issue around three times now. I mean, what's the point of making a warning that's shown AFTER the action ? 
---
As per the "studio not planning enough", I invite you to look at the history of Fo76 to realize that they are doing it upside down all along : 
---
--Half the things used in FO4 could be in FO76 but aren't, for no known reasons, even the "simplest" things like CAMP material.
---
--The game lacked basic features that were added after release. 
---
--The content of update is delayed , and when it's not, the updates are bugged as hell.
---
--The current version of a whole part of the game is still shown as a BETA in the menu. 
---
Yeah, I understand that me playing doesn't equal a whole studio working, but that doesn't mean that whole studio is good at planning. Btw, wasn't it planned for us to receive a basic functionality today that was postponed A WHOLE MONTH ? 
---
But I understand, since they gave the roadmap so soon after release, maybe they were overwhelmed by the job. /S
---
Straight up my mentality. I went into the "Raider role play" with the general mischief intentions, "tunnel snakes rule!" Type attitude. Reading the absolute vitriol coming off the supposed "knights" and "paladins" of the wasteland has turned me further and further to the dark side. I almost exclusively play survival now, and the first hour is actively recruiting a squad of random players to gang up. Like any good raider boss. 
---
The usual veto to that is coming across some holier than thou brotherhood wannabe trash talking my "Raider" armor set. That gets me calling raider lines and spraying with an assassins explosive .50
---
I want a tropical island fallout. That could fit in the retro style world.
---
They're giving you a warning. That's what the pop up is for.
---
Wouldn't it be beneficial to add a cap sink to it too?
---
Removing large amounts of caps from the 'economy' by giving them an 'attractive' purpose might revitalise the currency.
---
I am no economist but the fact that they are so trivial to acquire vs how little can be done with them makes them a very poor currency?
---
Pick up every since weapon enemies drop and sell them. I sell out every single vendor in the game every time I play and end up with like a 1000+ caps each time. Now at level 60 I have over 14000 caps. I just buy all the ammo and ballistic fiber I need.
---
You can tell by his health he has a bloodied build going as well I would guess
---
This so much this, why it was thought a good thing for us to lug around these logs for months and months?
---
I understand there may be a quest addition but this is such lazy design.
---
Indeed. Only a lvl 13 at present and appreciate  the assistance everytime!
---
Use the ignore feature. He won’t be able to see or find you again
---
Saw the lvl 91 deathclaw brought him over to the sentry bots and looted his dead ass. Thanked him for dropping the night vision handmade. Been grinding for that one mod for awhile now. 👍
---
I only use one turret, and is more of a 'warning system' than anything else; I am very absent minded.
---
I tried to rig an 'early warning system' using laser 'traps' and a siren but that was just obnoxious.
---
A single turret is cheap and cheerful and once every blue moon it kills something too!
---
&gt;Int gives you more exp
---
Are you certain about that, I was under the impression thtat it had been proven that it does not and this belief that it did was a hold over from Fo4?
---
Huh. Well, to me there doesn’t seem like One good place to find them, because they’re sort of plentiful once you start scaving. Tag screws in you pipboy, you may be surprised by some of the things you’ve past over that had a screw in them. 
---
Workshops often reward screws for taking it over or defending. They’re also fairly cheap to buy from vendors. Same for ballistic fiber. 
---
Otherwise, there’s a desk fan in every office, everywhere. Don’t go to a mine looking for them.
---
I thought I'd cut through whitespring once, thought Id help the guards out with a ghoul, clipped a guard. Not be doing that again....
---
Incentive to bet more, I sell them for 50 as is. I need to get rid of the 100+ that I have
---
Maybe one could no harm, but I will finish my CAMP first. (Rebuilding)
---
I’ve seen stuff left in there before. It’s how I finally got the plan for a jukebox in my camp lol everything else in there I had already. So I added my known plans to it and went on my way.
---
I think it's more about people in general.  I'm on xbox  along with my wife and we are always willing to help out others.  And we have seen our fair share of helpful players and those who are not so helpful.  I would be willing to bet that what you use to play the game on is not the biggest deciding factor of whether someone wants to be lawful good vs chaotic evil.  
---
Just an opinion.
---
Fire proof reduces damage from explosives.
---
Est. Also I'm on pc
---
That’s good to know! I just specc’d into tormenter since my last fight w one
---
Oh, I’m on Xbox, sorry :(
---
They are giving it AFTER you've built. That's why it's useless. Do you even read what I write?
---
I can see an issue with a noob turning round and seeing a 100+ in PA running towards them, shooting...
---
Maybe they could utilise the already in-game board games like Blast Radius, Rad Poker and of course everyone's favourite: Catch the Commie (as suggested by  [u/PantsuitEmporium](https://www.reddit.com/user/PantsuitEmporium/) a day or two back).
---
I'd say for the most part the playstation community is more mature than xbox, i've had an xbox before and theres alot of screaming and shouting and shitty messages being sent by sour kiddies, playstation used to be like that too during the ps3 but the user base is older on average i think. Alot of ps users have been there since ps1, xbox seems to get the youngens.
---
I thought so too but I’ve seen numerous posts here saying it does, including one today that said the only thing unaffected is Quest xp. Mobs and crafting, you get a bonus. Either one of us could test it pretty simply ourselves... I haven’t got around to it yet. I’m inclined to believe it tho (might explain how xp from enemies seems inconsistent)
---
I’ve done that before
---
They have to do the top 3 based on time, because based on kills is way to easy to exploit. Just change server when you get to the top. 
---
And they want to do seasons where you have to start a new character each season, so they want something competitive. Based on time it's very hard to exploit.
---
They're not, they're all just people. Some are ok, some a nice, some are dicks. C'est la vie.
---
Yeah, you hit a robot once, they all hit you back for eternity....or until you server hop. 
---
I never thought to use that against someone like that. Good thinking!
---
Thanks for the offer anyway!
---
I was glad you included the legendary list! ...and disheartened to see what 100 legendaries looks like on paper, yeah. Shouldn’t be surprised, my experience all along has been similar. 
---
Had an amazingly tough battle during Heart of the Swamp with a 3* lvl 80ish Mirelurk Queen that lasted almost 15 minutes before I could loot the Hunters Wood Arm it dropped.
---
Using currency to gain some sort of advantage, you say? Interesting concept.
---
While were talking about disappointing weapons, the Ultracite Gatling Laser. I found the plan for a prime receiver a few weeks ago so really wanted to find one. Finally found one recently on a scorchedbeast aaaand the weapon sucks. Even with the prime receiver and the heavy gun perks.   
---
It took an eternity to find, the ammo is annoying to make and I scrapped it in 5 minutes. Would've held on to it until buffs but....stash space. And who knows when or even if they're planning to balance this stuff. The gun was supposed to do increased damage to scorchedbeasts... All Rise is infinitely more effective and that's a quest reward. Excuse the rant but yeah...confusing. Green lasers look really cool though I guess.
---
Yep.
---
This is such a fucking big deal that it isn't even funny anymore. I'm still suspended for ammo. I never had near the amounts they said I did. I even proved it in one of my posts. I had roughly 60k ultracite of all different types. 
---
The reason I my accounts got flagged is how I was moving items to my mules. Repeatedly transferring large amounts of ammo is why I'm suspended. I transferred ammo either via dropping it or via putting it in containers. Never trading to mules as the trade menu is very poor for mass trading.
---
Players are literally scared to craft items in massive bulk because they don't trust anything Bethesda does.
---
Oh dear, I have my Beta, my survival, my main, my trader and my atom farmer.....hmmmm. what will I do when Nuclear Winter starts?
---
Now imagine you put a lot of junk to the stash while having equipped that perk, your stash is full and you decided to remove the perk - stash goes over the limit? Every perks and legendary affixes that reduce weight (on armor) work only on items currently carried by player.
---
Also had this with someone repeatedly punching me... he got bored when I just went into my pipboy for a bit.
---
If i buy random legendary items, in bulk, to obtain more tokens, isnt the same?
---
I've got 2 accounts but the issue there is they don't share atomic store items, which is kinda a bummer if you like that sort of thing.
---
I found my first and only weapon with the explosive effect at West Tek. My loot pool is garbage. Ghouls slayers or hunters stuff. Lots of zealot garbage too.
---
Fair enough. I was just saying that I never came across such an asshole in about 100+ hours I’ve been playing
---
Could you do the quest? Sounds coo
---
I know this is late, but the stuff being sold on Ebay and other websites are third party and actually against Bethesda's ToS. That's completely different. This is Bethesda-sanctioned sales.
---
whether it was asked for or not, it'd be a good addition if it wasn't an item you bought with real cash.
---
This reminds me of that episode of Spongebob where Flats The Flounder follows him around just wailing on him all day but he’s a sponge so he’s just absorbing the punches, so all it’s really doing is tiring Flats out. 
---
You know that guy’s finger was sore from how many times he had to click the mouse to punch you. It served no purpose but to exhaust him, and provide you a laugh. People like him hunt folks in adventure because they know they’ll get their asses handed to them in survival. Job well done, mate! I hope the next time you run into someone on your travels, they’re much kinder than this idiot.
---
adding pay-to-win isn't fixing the game. they could EASILY add it to the loot tables at no charge like everything else.
---
Lone wanderer/Ranger bases just outside white springs resort, visitors are always welcome at his ranger outpost.
---
I want to see Bethesda suffer when somebody will find out a method to dupe those.
---
Oops, no free mney grabbing.
---
It is a lot better . I put it down in January and just picked it back up a week ago . Having a blast and the crashes are WAY down
---
I tend to drop excess ammo and plans in the suitcases at the train stations at Charleston and Pleasant Valley since those are higher traffic areas. Ammo types and plans more suited for higher level players (e.g. 5mm, grenade rounds), etc.) I drop in the suitcase in Watoga.
---
Haha, yeh shit happens!
---
Lol good luck, they’re removing player damage to bases today.. I would say you’d be better off in survival,  but if you’re one of those people who gets a kick from destroying peoples camps in adventure, it’s because you’re too crap at pvp to play on survival... bless up.....
---
I get this happening to lots of mobs, could be they spawning with alive animation for a new player on the cell just after they were killed by a player previously, they then reset to the correct current dead state after a few seconds?
---
I was under the impression as well. Shows that I still have loads to learn about the game.
---
I'm messing with ya lol lighten up :P
---
If they are like around 30+ level i like to sell them stimpacks for 1 caps each so they learn that everything won't be handed to them for free.
---
And i write that without a condescending tone.
---
I give known plans to new people.
---
I also give Salisbury steaks, 100% fusion cores and purified water.
---
:) no worries, just wanted to make sure you weren’t one of /those/ assholes...
---
I flash my light
---
whitesprings sentry bots are an easy way to farm fusion cores.  those guards were made to be destroyed.
---
The past Fallout games have earned a fair amount of goodwill (but it's been tested by this release). But I'd say primarily it's the lore and the history and the fundamental Fallout experience (50s era nostalgia and humor) that keeps us here.
---
Well now I feel lucky. I use automatic handmade and it brings them down fast enough. The problem is when they die in the air and to add to that I was surrounded by mole miners, so I had no idea where it went. After I dealt with the other mobs finally was able to start searching. 10 minutes had passed and I was still circling lake Reynolds and it's surrounding woods. And then I dove into the water. Next to the children toys was my prize. And the loot was epic scorchbeast bones and leather ...
---
I enjoy my 15 strength increased to around 23 with my mutations and Armor that gives my melee character a nice FPS boost 🙂
---
You are very short sighted . Yes it will put everyone on an equal playing ground when it launches but within a day the people who can play for multiple hours a day will be right back on top . I play a couple hours a week and I’d rather not have to start over from scratch
---
Idk man seems like a fairly broad generalization to draw from one anecdotal experience
---
Haha yeh I jus wanted my junk. Mostly I use my normal gatling gun but was tryna burn thru some other ammo lol
---
"Pay it forward" would be an awesome camp-sign item.
---
I don’t think that the kits are supposed to be released yet. Could be wrong though.
---
Not at lvl11 they weren't. 😁
---
I will have destructive vengeance soon...
---
Yeah caps have lost their value completely for dedicated players. Almost no high level items sell for caps anymore, just item for item trades. It's mainly because people started doing vendor runs on multiple characters, which caused a huge inflation in the supply of caps.
---
One of the reasons people likely don't even try to cooperate for this event, is that if they kill legendaries before anyone does, it increases the likelhood of being able to sell the drops afterwards to the people who participated in the even without a chance to get their own drops. It's all about caps for some people.
---
The other is that they're stocking up on legendaries, good and bad for the vendor. So they dont take any chances and end missing drops.
---
^^this^^ a most sensible suggestion.
---
Suck it and see ✌️
---
Hopefully never you duping pos
---
I mentioned this last week. Downvoted like hell.
---
Have an upvote. Hate raiders (in game), but like the effort!
---
Sometimes you can get someone’s mutation to trigger and it’ll initiate combat, pretty sure it only works if the player attacking is wanted tho. Seems like they’re just bored, what lvl are you btw?
---
No, it required me going into the vault which currently isn't possible
---
Even better, Tesla rifle. if its a group of enemie you'll tag multiple at once with the arc passing through them all.
---
I encourage everyone to send the "come here" emote if you are alone and next to one of the three legendary mole miners ❤
---
/sarcasm I hope..
---
Raiders factions or ppl stupid behaviors? 🙂
---
The most fun part about this is, when they glitsch into your house but cant get out anymore and you have several traps and turrets in that room :=) Happens very rarely but, when it happens its the most fun u can get out of f76
---
Better get on your knees
---
yeah, we need better ways to communicate that were trying help or we have stuff for them.. bring on text chat on PC, but otherwise newbies please use mics :)
---
So you're judging people who use different platforms on the basis of one guys opinion?
---
Ok, I'll play along.
---
One reason could be that those who have the money to afford a decent PC are more likely to be older, possibly maturer.
---
But that also assumes that most Console Gamers are immature children, which rightly annoys those who aren't.
---
Truth is, we're all as varied in personality as we are in reasons for playing on the platform we choose.
---
I'd love if a certain tier of the specials were unlocking additional benefits.
---
I think for some special stats these could be little stronger than others. Perception, agility and luck needs nothing special. Inteligence, Charisma and Endurance should get something cool. Strengh is in middle ground between the two groups imo.
---
Well there are already a few backpack mods in the game files that do special things but I'm trying to be as non spoiler as I can
---
They are not bored, I think its just people which wants to show in a videogame how cool and strong they are, because in real life they probably suck so bad and probably have no social life because they play 16 hours per day.
---
I ran into a lvl 97 dude the other night, he was wearing Grog outfit and using a Grog axe. He was really into it. He destroyed my lvl 30 friend's camp completely, then I showed up, turned off pacifist, we killed each other a few times, then I made me kill and gave him a thumbs up emote. He wasnt even collecting my dropped loot. He was happy, he stopped attacking camp, he popped out a flag (picture mode), did a camp emote, and went in search of other camps to attack. 
---
What's the point of all this? I mean you have to be sick for that. I understand people like PvP, but why attacking a low level player with no reason? Rebuilding a camp could be tedious when youre low level. I had to rebuild every single piece for him. 
---
But this is not the point, Bethesda created Survival, so these guys should go there and have fun in open PvP. Probably there it would be a lot harder to grief people, cos i guess there are very skilled and OP builds running around, and you cant even see markers on map.
---
This is my opinion, definitely PvP lovers will not agree, but I think it makes more sense to leave adventure mode for people which like to cooperate, trading, exploring, camp and basically being nice to each other.
---
It's okay to hit someone to ask for PvP also in adventure, but If I dont answer back, whats the point of forcing PvP?
---
Yeah let me go spend all my atom points on repair kits that’ll really give me an advantage over all these players...lol pay to win. So fucking dumb.
---
Patrol the mojave I hear they like nuclear winters
---
50 
---
So I guess if I had the Tesla coils on my power armor it would of initiated?
---
Thank you, it worked!
---
what exactly is wrong with that statement? Bethesda originally stated in clear english that the Atom Shop would ALWAYS be cosmetic-only. That means these repair kits would make them liars about the one promise that got hundreds of people, myself included, to give the game a fair chance. This betrayal is the final straw for a LOT of us. If they want more purchases from the Atom Shop, they should release high-quality skins like the Rider power armor skins that have BEEN IN THE FILES OF THE GAME SINCE THE BETA. NOT break promises.
---
New game mode coming in the summer.....hmmmm
---
Probably just companions
---
Well and here I am eating mentats before each bulk crafting moment to maximise the exp gain. Intelligence works wonders for exping. Egg head is terrible for combat but great for farming level.
---
Aliens , more deathclaws ,more hermit crabs ( coolest mob in game imo) , giant spiders ,and maybe some mutated mountain lions. What other predators call wv home?
---
I pick them up from the tnt dome 7 and the nuka cola fan boy in the basement of one of the feats in morgantown
---
This. There's hundreds of open world survival games out there, and like Fallout they all have different "flavours."
---
It's not that I prefer 76, but that that's what I have a craving for currently.
---
The plans cost a fortune. I found one at Camp Venture.  2x at Harpers ferry and one at the railway station towards the top of the map a bit to the east ( can't think of the name ).
---
It can take a while.
---
Watoga is unpredictable. It can be level 14, 38, or 50 lol
---
I’m so happy I sort by new so I can see absolutely astonishing posts like this at 6am in the morning
---
If that was the case then being able to respawn areas by having someone new come in wouldn't work. I usually only see this on long running servers so I'm guessing it's more than likely resource culling
---
i mean, look, it's better than memes.
---
Nah Mallee all them turrets?
---
Yes.
---
if you're in combat with someone and your WEAPON breaks, you need to find a workbench to fix it as well as have materials to fix it. Not true with a repair kit. THAT'S THE ADVANTAGE. And even then, it's not just about the repair kits. It's about the fact that they're breaking the promise of "cosmetics only"
---
Hi I'm one of those people!
---
No the stack is a hidden number but it is still there
---
I wanna go full wasteland Captain America with a manhole shield with the responders symbol while firing a pistol!
---
It's also the chance on the special loot that increases
---
&gt; New Features: Legendary Vendor (May 23) and Scrapping – Locate the mysterious Purveyor to exchange and scrap your unwanted legendary items for new legendary gear. For every star rating on a legendary item you scrap, increase your chances to get the legendary weapon or armor of your dreams. 
---
From the roadmap
---
New Game mode?  Wonder what that will be
---
That sounds like a possible cause, it’s kind of funny when I go to a new cell and everything drops dead, like that guy holding the ‘ spear of destiny’ in the Keanu Reeves movie Constantine 💀
---
Cpu raiders. Humans, have at it... (please leave my hut alone...)
---
it's not just repair kits. it's the breaking of the "cosmetics only" promise that will leave us open to much worse P2W options.
---
It was pretty boring following her. I stopped after the overseer camp. I still run into her holotapes around the place but could not be bothered listening.
---
Google f76 legendary effects and it’ll give you all the options
---
Hey look, another poster trying to be edgy and witty bashing the game. If you don’t like it, fine, no big deal. Just go away quietly.
---
the most annoying part is when they actually run through one of the outer doors and exit the building, sometimes disappearing forever.. Have had that happen quite a few times at west tek
---
Yeah there is actually a little more to the story I was doing a messenger quest he fast traveled to it started hitting me I thumbed down and just kept doing the quest ignoring him.
---
After the quest finished about 5 minutes after he first tried is where the video starts
---
This. I play on Xbox and have access to another GT but I'd like my robot kills and hours played to keep incrementing.
---
Tech data does stack but turning in more than 2 doesn't give you anything more than if you turned in 2. Turning in 2 however gives you more caps and better reward chances
---
If they were wanted it’s possible, It used to be no matter what then something like that would trigger it but now it seems to only be if the player attacking you is wanted. Haven’t tested this myself but I watch enough PvP videos to see it in action, RageChronicles and JoeCool do it on PS4 it’s some good shit honestly.
---
Sounds like you need to use class freak to reduce your negative effects from mutations
---
Also that extra carry weight!
---
It's not pay2win ass*ole
---
All the noobs that are whining about duped gear circulating around - and thats whining definitely - cant just comprehend the idea that problem of duping has been solved since. 
---
How come? Dupers estimated the value of items based on their PvP capabilities. At the time where duping was rampant, TSE guns had much greater damage output than it does now, and people were fighting under slap damage mechanics that completely negated any tactical aspects of gameplay. Since the TSE nerf, overhaul of weapons from last patch, and release of survival -people that use TSE + Sentinel Assassin are considered food by those who do real PvP and who don't have their fun from griefing PvErs.
---
I have my stash on five characters full of loot. I have been grinding and trading since beta. And you know what? Most of it is now garbage, and the selected few pieces that are not - those I buy from other players almost for free because they consider them garbage.
---
Sure we could have a fresh start experience and I will support the idea of seasonal survival servers because the "fresh out the vault" is a good experience and lore-wise how the game should be appreciated. I'm not against giving people that. But if you think that duped gear is still a relevant problem, then on those seasonal survival servers your position in the food chain will be just as it is now. Pros will get their first bullshit 1* bloodied weapon on day 1, their first 1* unyielding set on day two, and on they three they would be able to farm caps from people wielding the old and obsolete duped gear we still have circulating in the economy.
---
I had a knuckle head try that with a TSE on me. I stepped close enough for them to be in the blast radius and they killed themselves. Funniest moment I have experienced with a griefer.
---
THIS PLEASEEEEE
---
If we can Take or Play holotapes, then we should be able to eat food off the floor!
---
I meant that in a good way...
---
Clipboards are not screws. Springs
---
The entire thing is already in the game just locked down
---
This is just a normal map prop, I’ve been begging Bethesda to let me place this in my camp since the launch of the game. I specifically remember the disappointment of the scout camp after being so hyped up after seeing this exact poster.
---
I broke down and got a second account and it has become very useful. A shared stash would be great though.
---
Thanks for turning to insults immediately, kid. Also it is pay to win. It gives an advantage. A very slight advantage, but ANY purchase that gives an advantage classifies as pay to win by definition. It's not JUST the repair kits though. They said this was just the beginning of their plans. If they think they can get away with this (their original promise for the Atom Shop was "cosmetic only"), what's to stop them from deciding to sell stimpaks, or eventually legendary weapons or XP boosters? What if they sell that option they mentioned for sending scrap to your stash remotely? Gee, that'd remove the entire point of PVP in both Adventure Mode AND Survival Mode because you could pay to just NEVER have your scrap on you. THAT is what the outcry is for. We've given them chance after chance. Sometimes they made good, but other times they squandered it.
---
Please nobody suggest Caravan.
---
To this day I have not figured out how to play that damn game.
---
Backpacks are already in the game and functional just unobtainable
---
Can someone ELI5 caravan? I could never understand how to play it. Lmao
---
Oh snap, you right, you smart.
---
Right? Even after many revisits to NV, I still don't know what the hell I'm doing when playing Caravan.
---
I tend to prefer Instigating weapons overall due to the nature of stealth sniper playstyles in Bethesda games, but a Furious energy weapon could work some magic.
---
Every game needs money to survive, the developers have mouths to feed, they have to make money somehow. TOXIC youtube gaming culture has ruined FO76
---
Yes this emote should be added to the game!
---
I do the same with the BoS rifle, serrated machete, water, stim, food. Never thought to include bobby pins. I do wish I could mark it as a bundle and drop with one click, though.
---
But if it becomes double xoxo normally then they will they have to make it quadruple xp to “incentivize” players?
---
NO, I WILL GO AWAY VERY LOUDLY
---
Weird.
---
Are we supposed to be impressed by the edginess here?
---
I think the differences in this game by platform are less than most games. A console takes less time and money investment, so you're more likely to get children but also more likely to find casuals. I play on Xbox and the social features of the platform make grouping, LFG, trading, and playing with friends a breeze. Almost everyone has a headset to plug in when necessary. I think ps4 is probably the middle ground.
---
It’s a bug. They are weapons without legendary mods yet somehow keep finding ways into the spawn rate for legendary enemies. It was reported fixed, but it’s not completely.
---
This. People in here tend to think they are the average FO76 and representative for the whole community. Where in fact most of us can not put 800 hours into a game line OP.
---
perk cards do nothing to the stash
---
Just like Borderlands slot machine would be sweet.
---
me or the guy?
---
that's because perks do not effect the stash
---
As someone who doesn't use lots of ammo I drop my unused ammo whenever I see a lowbie, some times theyll give me a stim pack in returm
---
I know now. Thanks.
---
I got the BoS Knight paint-job yesterday from the Forbidden Knowledge quest. No screencap yet since I ironically don't have any T-60 armour to paint it onto, but I can assure you that the plans themselves exist.

---
According to the data files, yes scorchbeasts count as scorched for zealots gear.
---
&gt; But you do have to learn the plan to get the next plan in line.
---
I'm not sure that's the case. I got the Knight one yesterday, and I don't have the Initiate one yet.
---
These are also your "bullies" IRL......
---
I will agree that the youtube circlejerk screwed over FO76 hard. However, you're missing the point. People will buy stuff if it's GOOD. Most of the items on the Atom Shop are not appealing. However, I'm guessing you may not know what the Rider power armor skins are. I was GOING to buy them the moment they came out, and have been waiting since the PC beta when I discovered the textures and models in the game files, but I'm not buying ANYTHING until they backtrack on the non-cosmetics they PROMISED would not be in the Atom Shop.
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/TB6u5Xi](https://imgur.com/gallery/TB6u5Xi) THIS is how you get people to buy from the shop. This level of quality.
---
The other guy I responded to. Using in game currency to get ahead? Lol that’s what it’s for.. some people and their pay to win conspiracies man.
---
Sake. Why didn’t I think of that?
---
I make sure to stack it in the overseers from now on
---
I thought the same thing lol
---
Until a Gutsy hits you! Man do they hurt.
---
To be fair, much if the music played is rather simple and off key.. Or off rhythm..
---
Thanks :D
---
Power Armor Mannequins too, please. I have a huge collection and it's not the easiest thing to show off.
---
Flatwoods of all places, the church has a fan upstairs and downstsirs and a typewriter as well. They get snatched not as often as I would think, and it's already on a trading route for me anyway.
---
the dungeon is the 16th, sheepsquatch is 9th.
---
also coming on the 9th is vendor pool, and item renaming.
---
Lies! We all know performance is based off charisma!

I’ve seen level 24 ultron whatever they’re called robots. Even that level they’re not easy.

Crickets more like crikey amirite
---
Cheers I still think that maximally buffed (strange in numbers) maximally limited (class freak) egghead mutation is a terrible choice if you want to optimise combat parameters :)
---
Thanks mate
---
With full class freak the game says you lose less than 1 strength
---
Well, damn, I didn't know that. I'd been in the habit of picking up one then dropping it off before going back to get a second one when I located that second one because I was of the mistaken belief that they didn't stack and that anything past the first was wasted. I'll have to keep this in mind.

Do u have (xb1)  or ps4 or pc

I agree. I’m on Xbox and have had people come and help me build up my base and one man saw me struggling in the nuke zone with all the rads and told me to get the radical perk card  and join his team. Made my day :)
---
It would be cool if they did that. However, Bethesda would have to heavily optimise their servers in order for them to handle 50 people in the same world. As you can probably already tell. With 24 people per server we still have a lot of server instability. From what I’ve experienced, the less people on a server, the better it performs.
---
They usually run for the hills, which is both heart breaking and comical but if we keep at it, they'll get the message eventually that we aren't all monsters😁
---
that is unfortunate
---
that means there is not issue without PA or Hazmat (which removes all other resistances...?)
---
I don't mind getting PA in blast zone, but that restricts builds a lot, somehow... :/
---
Always drop stimpak or super stimpak for level below 50.
---
May fallout spirit be with you.
---
they're also rewards for events, though.
---
I don't know if im crazy or what.. But it seem like some of the challenges reset. Like.. Im still unlocking things like kill 76 blah blah blah. Im lvl 120. Except certain cryptids, I shouldn't be getting those still. Certainly not while fighting super mutants.

HEADS UP:
---
I will be starting a road trip Saturday morning at 2 AM and will get back home Wednesday morning. Sorry for anyone that was hoping to try it out this weekend.
---
In my experience 70% of the people doing this event will go out of their way to let you tag. Personally I use my lowest damage gun and make the "come here" emote.
---
Shear terror and weapon / armor renaming
---
I think player icons shouldn't exist, but It'd be awesome if there was a golden circle on the map, like events have. You should know the vague area they're in, but not the location.
---
Also a power armor stand to show off our set
---
I've been added things to low level camps after they join the team I'm level 5with rockets and fusion generator they always seem happy
---
I only have 2.  I made the second one just because my trophies I got during the beta were glitched.  What’s the reason for having more than 1?  The game allows you to play the way you want no need to switch to another just change your cards.
---
Yes it’s improved quite a bit.  Come hang out In the wasteland. I’ll make you some nuka moon shine we can share it on my patio.
---
Well, it's Bethesda normal, if you get my drift.
---
What got my frames stable was turning own lighting to medium
---
It happened a few times and I was hoping to be proved wrong (which is have been), the people I've spoken to must have just had bad experiences and remember those more than the good times :)
---
Or will probably be hard cores mode or the equivalent
---
Y'know it's not until you see it so neatly recorded like this that you realise what a lot of mostly useless shit drops from legendaries...
---
One hunting rifle... what hopes do I have? XD
---
During the day my fps was all over the place but at night it was constant 60
---
Thanks man, I was let trying or judge just understand if there was an issue on Console vs PC or if the people who I've spoken to have just had some bad experience. 
---
Glad I was proved wrong :)
---
I love this game but am terrible at shooting. Lol I mostly melee and snipe. I am on the hunt for an explosive weapon, think it may help.
---
All of these nice behaviors have happened to me on Xbox, he was genralizzing
---
I don't remember explosions in fo4 sending bodies away across the map, but then I also didn't spent that much time killing robots
---
I have the same experience. Finally got the nerve to go there and only got 1 one * outside and one on inside. Got armour from both, my luck is 6 if that matters.
---
Walk of shame...it happpens
---
I just want more flags, firebreathers for my firehouse, bos, responders
---
I walked around with a friend blasting the enclave radio from fo3. When I found a level 9 he ran from me and hid in a container. After talking, I convinced him to join the enclave and I spend the next 15 min walking him through the first enclave joining quest, giving him a bunch of water and stims, then leaving, sending him on his way.

Fallout 2
---
I was under the impression that Atom shop stuff was non-transferable.
---
Is that no longer the case?
---
Judging by this games community I doubt it would be too too bad
---
It's so good. You just get between 21 and 26 in all 3 spaces, your numbers can only ascend or descend (unless you play the queen or a matching suit). King doubles, jack cancels, joker does something super complicated that I forgot.
---
I like it! I'll have to do it
---

---
The new meta is selling me all the explosive energy weapons stored in your January 2019 time Vault/stash.   They.....they are utterly valueless now.  I would be doing you such a favor.   Pinkie promise.
---
It's funny when you kill a Legendary Sentry Bot. There's only one word to describe what it does and it's not even a real world: it explodinates (it explodes because it's a legendary robot, and then it detonates itself since it's a Sentry Bot)
---
Correct.
---
Those of you asking about why Legendary Super Mutants run away from you should check out a post I created a little while back where this exact topic was discussed. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b4u5vg/honest_question_why_are_high_level_legendary/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
I have noticed that it applies more to 1* and 2** Super Mutants versus 3*** from my experiences. The 3*** Mutants tend to stay and fight and are often equipped more like crown bosses I’ve noticed. 
---
Legendary enemies trying to get away from you seems to be limited to Super Mutants and non-event connected Legendary Scorched (I.e. Legendary Scorched at the SBQ event do not try to run away but the standard spawn ones at say Harper’s Ferry do).
---
Super Mutants are the only ones with dedicated voice lines of “Retreat! Retreat! and Runaway!Runaway!” 
---
I have had to chase the West Tek ones down more than a few times. When approaching from the exterior, I pay attention to the chatter as if a 1* or 2** is outside, you’ll hear him say it as you approach (and if you have general subtitles on, the Legendary title will display). 
---
I’m still a bit skeptical on whether the Luck stat and the One hit versus multi-hit affects the drops. I do realize (as I’m sure we all do) that it sometimes takes a second or two after the killing for the actual legendary item to spawn in inventory. I’ve made the mistake of immediately collecting loot after a legendary killing a couple of times and it resulted in no legendary item spawning in. This MAY be coincidence or it may be that by immediately collecting, it either blocks or glitches the legendary item from spawning in. 
---
My new strategy is to kill in sections and then go back and collect all at once after a particular area or quadrant has been cleared.
---
I love how this sub hates all the Youtubers that were critical of the game. And only like the one that have nothing but glowing praise for it. 😂😂😂
---
so its not possible to let someone else with the paint mod paint my armor mod?
---

An ex emt and fire fighter who fought in Anchorage as a Power Armor specialist, he has a fire house compound and has continued the firebreathers as a miltia against the scorched and any other muties the wastes will throw at him

I heard the nukes don't really change the inside of buildings but I could be wrong.
---
Christ! Wish I had bottle cap for every time someone asked of this forum 'can I come back now'?
---
Funny you say that cause I was actually saving up all the 2 shot and/or explosive energy weapons I could get my hands on hoping they'd get a patch and a buff one day lol. I heard tse got nerfed though.
---
Mmm 😎 all that delicious junk, I want point and click junk harvesting IRL 🙂
---
But:  they have been releasing new content starting in early March.  An alcoholic robot questline.   Dedicated pvp world.    Today, a new cryptid questline, consolidated vendor cap pools, and all vendor reps at Whitesprings to make lives easier.   Something new every few weeks for months as part of a “Roadmap.”  Good new Atomic shop content.
---

...What?
---
Absolutely filthy walk of shame 
---
I’m now the fertiliser prince of the savage divide
---
Clearly the developers have a different opinion as they are clearly moving down the road of separate game modes.  If you want the "horror genre" there is survival.  What we are discussing is not legitimate gameplay, it is griefing.  Legitimate gameplay allows you freedom to do whatever you want as long as it does not impact people without their consent.  From the announcement of the game Bethesda took the stance that PVP would be by consent.  If they were building the game you are describing they never would have had the whole pacifist mode/slap damage bullshit they have now.  Instead they attempted to half ass it to keep everyone happy.
---
Someone didn’t get their juice box this morning
---
Not bad, they ever increase our cap limit? Got sick of buying random crap I had no use for to get under 25k lol.
---
I have to bribe my wife to stop shouting at dragons so I can get to my wasteland...
---
I’m almost exclusively a Two Handed Melee Build. I have two Ranged Weapons that I really only ever use during Scorchbeast Queen events. But yes, one of them is a Two Shot Explosive Prime Gatling, which seems like it was specifically designed just for SBQ fights. The other is a Prime Shotgun which is really only effective at close range when I’m tired of power attacking with Grognak’s Axe. 
---
The perk cards can vastly improve your shooting issues by providing crutches like larger spreads or increased damage or reload speed.
---
TSE nerfed.  Energy buffed.  Heavy buffed.  And yet:  heavy energy is soooo unwarranted.   Trust me.   You’ll just have to trust me.   But I can take them off your hands by trading you the new hotness: berserker’s nocturnal pipe pistols.   Don’t even ask me how that combination is possible.   It just works.
---
I always store my excess scrap and known plans in the watoga train station, blue briefcase. Make it a habit to do the same peeps, a lot of people already do :D
---
On a serious note, TSE prices are rebounding sharply despite the “nerf.”
---
I really hope the blackbird paint doesn't return, it showthst I'm a veteran and I wanna keep it
---
Only had a few of them, mostly person guns. I do have an explosive laser pistol, an explosive laser rifle, 2 two shot gat lasrs, and a 2 shot gat plasma though.
---
Just shit and giggles go up to one and don't loot and look as other take the stuff right from your list. Then tell me if that is fair.

---
I think this is what you're referring to? I might give this a go tonight.
---
"Not only that, but it goes against the core message of the game's intro where we see the vault dwellers leaving to rebuild hand in hand. Not against each other."
---
Did you not see the bubblegum chewing hooligan with the pompadour? The main message of the game was to rebuild, but rebuild in what image? Plenty of players are asking for heads on spikes and gore bags, in addition to players asking for other usable camp objects and QOL improvements. Raider camp cosmetics are one of the most common requests. 
---
Your appraisal of pvp balance is spot on, gear stacking and specific cards make certain builds absolute monsters, but that's part and parcel to the fallout universe, there's the regular Joe's, then there's the wandering death gods known as the courier or sole survivor. As for workshop pvp on adventure servers, that's exactly where it belongs. Players are warned at the claim bench. 
---
Personally once survival is out of beta id recommend it being for new or legacy characters, not standard adventure characters, and make converting your main into a legacy force that legacy character into survival.  It would maintain the wandering death god feeling on survival, but force hardened pvpers into survival where they can easily be lead into an ambush.
---
Left arm is light, right arm is sturdy, chest is light (i think) and legs are heavy.
---
Not yet.  But at least they’ve spared us the half hour per day doing vendor cap runs.   (Or are about to with today’s patch).
---
All very valuable now.
---
My patience payed off. Now if only I could hold the caps...
---
Sometimes when that event shows up and you fast travel to it, you will gltich inside the vault. There is no way to fix the event though atm.
---
I thought bulking only worked on only two things for weight saving?
---
Thanks, :)
---
Any plus is still a plus. Was really hoping there'd be some new stuff to do by now, I miss the Wasteland.
---
Every other online game has a shared stash, I was wondering why this one did not. Good idea.
---
Great work! But your cap amount per run seems very low, I guess you didn't check the 3 cap stash spawns and the big loot stashes in the green pools?
---
Because of timezones and I think majority of players ate in NA. Upnuked a fellow vault dweller.
---
Llmore old weapons in general, that flame pistol from tactics, deliverer, deagle, more lmgs,
---
Dont forget that yao guai full body skin on the floor.
---
Yep, 76 is my current go to. I thought one piece world seeker would replace it but in my opinion it's utter crap so I came back to 76.
---
We shall see how long Days Gone will keep me away from 76.
---
We havent had any breakthrough update for last two weeks, its high time the devs added fourty new items and ten new quests.
---
I doubt there are many games where players could say that :D
---
Thats a great idea! I never knew what to do with them other than drop them in a brown bag when i see other players.  I'll do this now
---
There are new things—again, two new questlnes and pvp servers in the last four weeks alone.  RAID dungeons on near horizon.
---
I mean not crafting bulks of junk but bulk crafting of items i.e. 200 civil era top hats :p
---
Quoth The Sheepsquatch:
---
Baahhhh
---
Nah, doubt it's because some people are doing stuff they shouldn't. It's probably as simple as saying that enemies moving around is less demanding to display than handling the cell loading. Haha
---
Just lost 50 caps playing lol. My buddy ended up in the top of the Ash Heap and I woke up in the Bog. He was 18 caps away from Whitesprings and I was 19 caps away!
---
Cross between Sturgess and Proctor Ingram. 
---
I tinker, I build things, I sell those things to get caps so I can learn to build more things.
---
Yep, this post is old, back then I confused outfits and under armour. Not wearing Tattered dress though anymore, because Perception is useless from my point of view.
---
Oh really?
---
Maybe also adding head mounts
---
I could hold your caps for you.  You would transfer them to me, secured by a berserker’s nocturnal pipe pistol I would graciously spare.  On a serious note:  you can have five characters.  Load up each at 25k.
---
I want to see more hermit crabs . They are the coolest mob in game
---
Yeh the big stuff is more what I meant, although I'm deff gonna hop on and check out the new quests in the meantime. Beth was always great at side quests. Survival server sounds interesting too.
---
I’ve heard some say this as well
---
Read up before you go.  Caps losses are doubled, and significant aids losses occur, upon death.
---
Nice clean, spacious layout. Love the 'drawbridge' style entrance! :D
---
Cool build!
---
Ok I guess I’ll do testing later lol
---
Ok cool thanks
---
Awesome thanks
---
Pvt. Beck Brightstar - Rebecca Hofmann is a born and raised vault dweller. Trained as a Responder and recently joined the army. She suffers from terrible fear of power armor, so she never used or will use one. Also afraid of nuked zones, because they shattered her family. No plea for help will remain unanswered and will often leave goodies for the youngsters. If I am in the area and you call for help, I will come regardless of the treats.
---
My game was perfectly fine last night. Played for hours straight on the same server.
---
Sounds like a lot of work tbh. I have 2, my main and my storage from when my stash got full. Was a pain transferring all that haha. I assume the duping is all over so I see no real harm in upping the limits. I heard there were some blanket bans and account resets.
---
Moving your camp location and rebuilding will move the xp bar halfway up. Building is a xp bonus and a nice break from events.
---
Just don’t cheat.....
---
Also, Hancock Outpost usually has a few ballistic fiber among other things, and only a few scorched need to be killed. Monorail elevator sometimes yields.me upwards of 100 lead units
---
Losing aids sounds pretty go to me (rimshot). In all seriousness I like that, glad they took it serious and made it a bit more hardcore,
---
Interesting. Not really an exploit then if that's the case.
---
&gt; Est
---
GMT for me, we'll be ships passing in the night :) 
---
 I've got an alt that I'll farm data and test, I'll try  with 2, 3 and 4, and see  what drops.
---
I play on xbox. I leave stuff for new players all the time. I also find a lot of stuff that others leave for them too. I build them guns, armor, soups. I think that your friend just had bad luck. I mean we're all just people.
---
I just want to transfer my level 10 bloodied legendary and some cosmetics to my new character
---
I find kind of dirty for saying this but... I hope so too.
---
Aren’t weapon racks in patch 9?!?
---
I usually give my low level legendary that are pretty decent to low levels helps clear stash space for me plus I have bunch of bull junk and if asked will usually give some over how much needed
---
Thank you so much for finding Kenny I accidently left the gate open and when I returned to my C.A.M.P he was gone the whole family was heart broken can you meet me at White Spring so we can get him back.
---
I wish I could get my wife to play, she won’t play shooters of any kind because she still has trouble with joysticks on console 😓. Thinking about getting her into PC games because it might be easier for her.
---
Cool bro.
---
This is crazy, I just server hopped for the fourth time here and havent found a single legendary each time
---
I'm going to have to find a super detailed guide, because everytime I think I understand it. I realize I don't. Lmao
---
Yeah it happens in other Creation games too so it's probably not the server. The weird thing is though that the enemies don't suddenly skip ahead (you'd think they would - it's be like a lag spike). I actually think the engine has really damn good netcode, considering how massively open the world is and how dynamic and unpredictable enemy group spawns can be and all that. It's pretty rare for the AI or other players to lag out, in my experience.
---
I have stayed away from events because of the FFA at the end. Taking a nukashine shortly before the event completes is a great idea and starts you on your next adventure.
---
I love the current leaderboards. There is certain benefit for certain playstyle due to how they are organised, and hear me out and I hope you will agree with the positive consequences this has.
---
For now, all I need to do if I want to lure enemy PvP teams into a trap is to stay alive. I don't need to camp spawns. I dont need to KoS people on sight. I don't need to grief the shit out of people if I want to be the map marker, and I get the best fun if I use the map marker to lure enemy teams to battleground of my liking.
---
If on the other hand I wanted an alone PvE experience, all I have to do to miminize risk would be to perform a controlled suicide in my camp.
---
Current situations allows the competetive players to have their competition, and those who want adventure on steroids to play it safe. Getting rid of the the map markers would make the game much less thrilling for PvPers, and you can still prevent yourself from getting to leaderboards if you play it cautiously.
---
I would only accept idea to get rid of map markers if worlds had much more than 24 players. 64 maybe? Otherwise its just too big for enemy teams to find each other.
---
I remember being given an explosive pump action shotgun at level 10 and it was a level 25 weapon. I'm level 90 and I still use that shotgun
---
They're increasing the selection screen volume.
---
"veteran" in a 5months old game. i played since release, too. had a break when they sold it in atom shop. so from my stand i hope they bring it back, like they did with the grognak costume. and i hope they add more new skins for powerarmor and armor. i know its cool having something others dont have. but this was not a result for hard work, just lucky to be online on that day \^\^
---
I’m sorry, but your first few sentences were all I needed to read. The whole if:dislike then:adhominem is tired as far as arguments go.
---
Don't you remember when there were npc's? They weren't what I'd call.... strategically minded...
---
That wasn't passive aggressive...
---
A repair kit would have really helped me last night, broke my gun in the middle of a nukezone, It would have saved me from losing those wonderful steel scrap and dog food.
---
you are a good man, Sir Doot.
---
AWAY FROM THERE! NOW!
---
I does indeed look like a robot. Looks like an assaultron puppy to me.
---
Well, yeah but some of the new skins are really cool too I also have the t 51 Christmas skin to flex during the holdiays
---
How much?
---
Heck i’m not even melee and i died a couple of times accidentally shooting a door. I should get that lvl 3 fireproof lol
---
It was my go to weapon for Albino rad scorpions.
---
I read that as "edible". :P
---
I always leave armour, weapons and ammo in either the mailbox at the church in Flatwoods or in a sac right by the door of the Train station at Whitespring.
---
It's amazingly hard to drop things for very new players directly-they usually run like mad. 😃
---
Someone call this man a WAAHbalance and maybe get him an order of some French cries
---
I’m pretty sure I given away over 300 purified water to low levels.
---
Sounds like you need a full set of troubleshooters armour, its what i use to breeze through silos in a few minutes
---
Right but he wants to ruin our fun just because he can’t compete . That’s crying
---
Twas the night before shear terror, and all through the sub,
---
Everyone forgot about the shitty pay2win creeping into the game because you all have really short attention spans
---
Or either one of those 2 corpses at the vault
---
Not really.
---
You on now?
---
Your welcome. Ill try and solve the others tonight if i can for people qnd make a new post about it soon
---
Bethesda replied. So they literally were ignoring the sub for a week waiting for you to forget about repair kits.
---
Fair enough, I don’t agree with removing content and mechanics because I don’t use them so I agree with you. There should be enough content for everyone who bought the game.
---
Hopeing to get them all done tonight. Alpha and charlie are done, just go bravos left and then ill post em up. Sorry for the wait.
---
Nice camp! I love water-based builds. My current camp is built IN a wide shallow in the river that runs north-south through the forest. Old industrial water treatment plant-kinda design. Really wish building in or near a larger water source upped purifier production though. Cheers!
---
If you are on ps4 I will buy all your cloth.
---
could you say the last part in a different way please, I cant understand what you mean.
---
Unfortunately, i find that i lose less caps in pvp with a bounty.  Eg. If i get killed with a 5 cap bounty i lose 5 caps. If i die in normal pvp i lose closer to 80. Anytime i go to pvp, i find a base, destroy a crop for the low bounty and head out. They need to up the bounties and make them stack with pvp loses.
---
There’s a very large group of us that play when we can and don’t take the game super serious.  Very helpful folks.  PM me if you’d like details.
---
Ooh that sounds helpful, how do I do that? I'm on ps4
---
Lol! Very good :)
---
Oh man, that's dark.
---
Haha, i did the exact same thing for that challenge last night
---
He says with a Responders tag next to his name....
---
I’ve figured this out after a lot of trial and error and have a way to prevent this in the future! Same thing happened to me in the exact same spot, the Whitespring station, so I’m very familiar with the building space there. This explanation gets a little confusing so I’ll differentiate one thing up front: 
---
if I’m talking about placing your C.A.M.P. to build in certain spot I’ll put CAMP (1)
---
If I’m talking about moving your green C.A.M.P. box around within your build space I’ll say CAMP (2)
---
Ok, so you placed your CAMP (1) in an appropriate area and are ready to build. You spend hours designing it, log out, log back in, everything is fine. Build some more, decide to move your CAMP (2) inside your house, log out, log back in, get the update error. At this point there’s nothing you can do besides relocate. 
---
Where the problem came from was moving the CAMP (2) to an area that you originally couldn’t place your CAMP (1). It’ll let you move your CAMP (2) there, but because it shouldn’t have let you, there’s an issue loading it back in once you logged out. 
---
So what I do to proactively prevent this is, if I want to move my CAMP (2) within my building space, I’ll first act like I’m relocating my CAMP (1) and see what spots are green and which are red. When you’ve found an appropriate building spot, cancel out of the “move your CAMP (1)” menu and you can safely move the CAMP (2) box to that spot. Now when you log out and back in, your CAMP should load in just fine. 
---
Like I said I tested this at the Whitespring station extensively and I’ve now had the same camp there for about 4 days without any issues. I have to keep my CAMP (2) more out in the open then I usually would, but at least it’s not making me relocate!
---
Sorry, my nerd was showing. I’m basically saying that opening a statement or argument with an claim, one that seeks to insult the target in a way that can’t possibly be proven, derails the validity of what comes after. Starting with an ad hominem  about how these kinds of players suck in real life and whatnot seems like a cop out.
---
I saw it used against her when I was level 90. We failed that fight with over 15 people around same level around November. I'm now level 220. I haven't seen it used since
---
That build works great in commando too. My alt was lvl 55 and a level 115 was wanted (55 caps so he was up to no good). I was watching on the map as a few level 100s tried to take the bounty.
---
I fast travel to him (WS Club House) and he starts spraying me with his TSE shotgun. No damage to me, ha ha. I let him burn his ammo and gun for a minute, run around the corner, pop a stealth boy, and unload a clip from my Furious combat rifle. Bye bye bad guy.
---
He didn't even seek revenge and left the server.
---
They never drop any loot for me. Do they really drop loot?
---
With the repair kits you can buy in the atom-shop being the **worst** out of three possible ways to repair your items and the only of those ways that does not repair them in a way that gives the item a buff/boost, I would define it as pay2lose, but hey, whatever you say man.
---
I do the same, but they don't know what the bag is, don't take it, or find the shooting threatening. The bag method is the only way to go with low levels because if they're genuinely new to the game they don't know how to trade really. If they do know how to trade and do it quickly it's probably a second character from a long time player. I should know, I've taken plenty of freebies on new characters of my own
---
Scoring up all the Springs, screws, ballistic fibers, adhesive you can find. Hoard it in your stash. You’ll need it later on in life.  Someone else said don’t repair early on. He’s right. Just find new weapons. Scrap the old. Scrap a lot of weapons before selling them. You learn mods when you scrap them.
---
I build fusion generators all the time for people and if I can spare the flux I will build them a decontamination  shower.  A couple nights ago I had a lower level player give me 10 fusion cores because they were over weight I come across a lot of nice players and very few idiots.
---
only the sentry bots give xp and have drops, the protectrons/mr handy bots do not drop loot or give xp.
---
The silence indicates Kenny ate the OP :/
---
still hard to follow but I think I got the message. I respect your opinion
---
Thanks for the info. You learn something new every day.
---
Because they posted 5 hours ago in a different time zone...
---
Hey now! The falling through the ground/pink atom store items thing was super entertaining to me. They even had a haiku bot!
---
Can you confirm whether it did or didn't have any effect on her? Only played around with the Syringer so much myself at this point, but I assume that if she has poison resistance - and enough of it - it may not work at all. I haven't picked up the perception perk to see her values however.
---
While my assumption is that they simply overlap and do not stack, it could essentially act as a failsafe on the timer if just four people out of the event group carried this weapon, essentially almost doubling the time.
---
No hurry. I’m surprised it’s even a future option. People cheated. Ban them and keep them that way.
---
yea. I don't think WS was necessarily meant to be such a high level place. it's in the forest, and early missions bring you there. I also don't think that it would be as popular of a location had they nerfed the exp from glowing ones sooner than they did. Folks seem to go there, and drop nukes there out of habit. there are some other places with high level mobs and good loot for nuking. Morgantown including morgantown airport is good. sugar grove spawns a good amount of legendary creatures which is what you want. quality over quantity.
---
I can't tell you how many times I have done this only to realize they think I'm attacking so they run away, leaving me to grab the bag and chase after them like a mom reminding their kid they forgot their lunch box
---
I was not using awareness. But based on how many times I have killed her. I would say the change is minimal at best.
---
I think it's more "mods said they'll delete repetitive threads"; nobody has forgotten, and everyone who was mad is still mad
---
Thanks to everyone for their input and feedback on the thread! I woke up to a lot of different opinion and takes.
---
And not to be a dick, but for all of you that commented that it wasn’t the best event, you’re not wrong, but you also totally missed the point.
---
It's even better when I see like level fuckin 190s and 200s giving level 10s 3 star legendaries and like every plan they own
---
May God Howard be with you
---
I said that, but got super downvoted
---
Oh and on april 16th they'll add a new (high level i think ?) dungeon
---

---
Had to defend my workshop from sheepsquatches.
---
I was excited until its corrected to mongrels.
---
I think the difference between PC and console is the cost of admission. PC players tend to be older on average because younger players can’t afford (or their parents won’t buy) gaming PCs. An older average player means a more mature average player (yes, there are mature and immature players on all three systems, but I’m talking averages). 
---
As far as Xbone vs ps4, the xbone was favored by the call of duty players when it came out and simple inertia would have kept players that prefer that type of game (and their children/siblings) on that platform. 
---
So to give caricatures:
---
xBone = fortnight 
---
PS4 = overwatch 
---
PC = PUBG
---
Planters, yes please. I want to make a greenhouse to circumvent the terrible terrain at my CAMP.
---
I launched a nuke at the queen and the entire server came flooding in to help kill it. We ended up not being able to kill it. (Sad I know :c )
---
Damage beats Mitigation still. It still depends whats shooting you and what your wearing. Doesn't change the fact there are many players who are not fully geared wondering why that guy they are shooting never dies. 
---
I've seen some players fully min/max'd take an entire clip from my Handmade like it was nothing from point-plank range. Its pretty crazy how powerful Nuka-Cola products are in pvp.
---
I have tested the Incisor perk with a DC Gauntlet, MM Gauntlet, &amp; Meat Hook, on a level 61 Hermit Crab that spawns near my Camp, and the Damage does not increase.
---
Martial Artist Perk was changed 2 patches back, and previously did affect both Unarmed, and the Gatling Gun (Rate of Fire) as well, but now it does not.
---
It was the first time I was approaching the top 3, and I was just following the main quest line on my lvl. 60 character. I had just finished up getting my credentials for the elevator in Fort Defiance, so I headed to fort defiance. Of course simultaneously I became #3 on the server as the line in the Sand event started at fort defiance, so I knew I would be hunted. Entered the fort, checked the map and #1 and #2 we're already outside. I ran down the closed off section, my heart racing. I hear the familiar explosive round shot fired off against the wall, and quickly duck and cover.
---
What ensued was a battle of epic proportion, battling through  the entire asylum, up through the elevator to the top floor. 6 other players showed up as all top 3 were in a single spot. I got a few kills, but it was just exciting to have a full on war through the corridors of that place.
---
I don’t get the downvote on this, he’s right. The error can be prevented, but a pop up after its too late without proper explanation is useless
---
I server-hopped into WS yesterday, where for a period of about five minutes I ran into 10+ legendary ghouls, a legendary ragstad, some weird diseased protectron, and walked away with about 15 legendary items. Even the non-*’s were dropping legendaries. Aside from an anti-armor Gatling and AR, the rest was crap. Server crashed during the run through.
---
I turned in 50+ Tech Data without getting a drop, then I finally got my Knight and Knight Captain paints from back-to-back turn ins last night. You’ll get them eventually, just keep doing your duty to the Brotherhood. Ad Victoriam!
---
Lol 😅
---
The core game is better played in adventure mode... it always will be.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Good guide thanks. I just started a new character just for survival. I haven't gotten past level 5 yet because I maybe get an hour a night to play. As soon as I get past level 5 I'm heading over to survival and I'll be utilizing your tips.
---
I haven't decided if I want a straight survival only character where I earn every weapon and armor piece or if I want to mule some stuff from my main character to my survival character. 
---
Given how everyone seems to be tooned for survival I may give myself some weapons and armor. But IDK yet because the challenge of earning everything sounds fun.
---
Got my morning giggles from this. Thanks, friend.
---
I hope not Kenny is a vegetarian!
---
Thanks mate! Inwas wondering cause some posts are less than two hours old. But I guess that must be it.
---
For Ammo, load up on the bullet making perk and super duper. Get version 3 of cap collector, level 3 of the scrounger perk and level 3 of super duper. 
---
I'm using shotguns and handmade almost exclusively and I am very rarely lower than 1000 rounds for each weapon. 
---
I recommend setting up camp near a lead node (or,a workshop that has a lead node) so you can build an extractor. 
---
Additionally, you can find a resource rich area and camp near it, and just make sure you farm everything possible. 
---
A few good spots for this are the Red Rocket in Morgantown, since you can run into the high school for a whole lot of everything, and go exploring the town for a whole lot more (including 4 or 5 cap stashes), the end of the railroad tracks near Harpers Ferry has a TON of stuff, including shitloads of ore and almost no enemies to really speak of that you have to engage. Helvetia is also a good place to camp near still since all of those buildings still spawn in stuff like all the cans (which have lead) and small amimals to farm meat from.
---
I would also like to know if the person can listen to me speaking or not. Too many PC players don't hear any voices because of Bethesda's dumb always active mic in the early days and people forgot to turn mic option back on.
---
Seems like every third or fourth person I talk to ::ahem:: 'knows somebody at Bethesda' and can get me banned if I do anything they don't like
---
And this image just made my morning!
---
thats awesome mate...good work..thnx
---
Let’s just be thankful that the map doesn’t slow shrink in the midst of nuclear fallout, slowly herding the entire player base to increasingly tiny spots on the map... #InevitableFalloutBR
---
That's so Bethesda. I guarantee nobody there realises it works like that. And we're left to just guess if we have 1 or 2?
---
Totally takes away the points of my VATS overlay
---
Thank you for posting this,  I’m even more excited for the new quest now 😁
---
Put a window in you bbn generator shed. Wire cant pass through a solid wall but can go through a window.
---
Because it was new content to 76 and thus completely rushed
---
It’s more like a bathtub full.
---
I’m levelled up and wearing my fresh Ultracite power Armour. I haven’t killed a soul in survival mode and want to test it out. I come across a level 38 in basic clothing, it’s time to smash (not like that, cheeky). I pull out my super sledge (not like that either, cheeky) and swing, he dodges and moves like the flash. He avoids my swing again and hits me twice with his hammer.
---
I go down like a cheap hooker.
---
I’m embarrassed and I’m streaming the whole thing live. I respawn near the train station and go for him again. He does the exact same shit but then I realise afterwards that he’s hacked the god damn game! 
---
Going to play the game on PS4 instead, I’m hoping it’s harder to hack 😂
---
I could go for additional EXP the longer you've been alive. Would balance out a lot people bringing low level players to survival in the Hope's of making caps.
---
I search for low level players in between missions to give them some plans and items like Stimpacks to keep them going :)
---
Crouching still hides your positions.
---
For me it’s all about generous intent.  I have a low level character though my primary one is around level 150.  After being approached with generous intent from a higher level, lev 50 etc, I bestow upon them the same intent when I return to my big girl pants with gifts of under armor and hats.  Omg all the hats.  You have no idea. Lol.
---
I've been gifting players so many plans I've lost count. I sometimes even tag along if they are ok with it and help them get xp by letting them tag enemies and then I'll finish 'em. I've also been helping some folks building their Camps and all that.
---
Helping folks and all that has a chance to meet some really interesting people and perhaps become friends with.
---
Downvoted? Jeez. My guess is that you got voted down because, while what you suggested definitely works, it’s more of a work-around for a mechanic some people don’t like as opposed to changing it all together. Sometimes I think it’s not enough for some folks to find their own way to deal with something undesirable. You can’t make a game where every mechanic appeals to everyone 100% of the time. 
---
For now, swan-dive off a cliff. No more leaderboard.
---
For anyone not already aware, you can't build-for or transfer-to any player, gear or workshop items that come in part or in whole from the Atomic Shop.
---
I just tested a Brass Knuckles I have vs my alt. I didn’t actually test the damage output, but Awareness showed that with Knuckles equipped, armor rating was dropped. I also compared with/without martial artist and there was an obvious attack speed difference between the two.
---
Yeah people need more than 125000 caps.... /sarcasn
---
I was wondering cause some of them are between 1-2 hours old but I guess that’s the reason. Thanks!
---
They need a Karma system like the marketplace sub for 76
---
BIG CHIEF EXPLOSIVE ROUNDS
---
Who cares about accuracy when everything you shoot explodes?
---
What platform are you on? I'm on PC and I havnt seen this happen in a very long time. (Except on survival where most people are dicks)
---
😂😂😂
---
Yeah, there is one in nearly all the towns.  I want it because I’m a Scout leader IRL.  
---
Can’t wait for that quest line to drop.
---
Which kind of ammo do you need? I'm Level 22 actually, and I have some ammo (partially / perhaps for a high level) which I don't need or use. I'm also playing on the Xbox, so if you want, I can give you some, if I have the ones you need. 😊 This would be a great way to say "Thank you" in representation for all the high levels, who have helped me since I began to play this wonderful game! 🙋🏻‍♀️😊
---
Thanks for the guide! I’m looking forward to playing survival mode so much, I feel like this is something the game needed and I’m so glad it’s finally here 🙂
---
I have an Assassin's/VATS crit combat rifle in addition to the Furious/VATS crit one and the difference in damage is very noticeable. I have always attributed that to Furious applying some kind of damage increase each successive shot which also applies to the crit damage. If that's not the case then I can come up with no explanation on why one gun deals a lot more damage.
---
You want to buy 'Plan: Advanced Power Connectors'.
---
Try Vendor Bot Wallace at Harpers Ferry. Failing that it may also appear on other vendors iirc
---
i have that, im just wondering how to use it. whats the purpose. i got the power wheel and theres called a “random switch”
---
it hurts a bit, but in the end this is a good decision. people could sell the paintings on market which would be an ingame benefit.
---
You don’t need to. You can sell them
---
My friends camp is next to Pleasant Valley Station, so we take a look if someones camping there, everytime we make a break / stop at his camp. One time there were three players, obviously a team. We started to fight them. Most of the fight (which took approx 30 mins) was around the small lake and directly next to my buddies camp. We fought and fought and fought and killed each other over and over again. We took their caps, they took them back and so on. This lastet around 30 mins as mentioned. Within this time, none of our opponents attacked or tried to destry my buddies camp. We even fought inside the camp a couple of mins, but all they wanted was a good fight with ither players and not to demolish a camp. It was a very good fight and proved, that not everybody in survival is an“griefer“ and some of us just want to have a good pvp time.
---
I have a ts one as well and I have to say, with all the mods on, it is one sexy looking piece of (naval) machinery.
---
Dont be suprised
---
You don’t need to. You can sell them unbulked
---
TS Gatling and TS .50 cal heavy gunner build with 2 star Rad Sponge shared to team.  
---
Always spamming the queen.
---
I use Marine Dense, and it’s only available as a mod afaik. I picked mine up after some rng at a vendor I want to say in Watoga, but if you’re impatient I bet they’re not that expensive via a trader
---
I just have trouble with some of the higher enemies. Only level 20. I haven't had any help tho, came across some nice people tho and that's what keeps me going. The community around the game can hold it together and keep me playing. I just like the game overall, it's fun to explore and roam and come across another person from time to time, sounds good to me.
---
when I leave HQ I drop a paper bag of low-level guns/ammo/spare plans by my 'thumbs up' vault boy statue just inside the door as a gesture and a thank you for not destroying my base while I'm out
---
hahahaha :D
---
Xbox. From the experiences I had with PC gaming years ago, the communities are generally nicer and more considerate. I believe it has a lot to do with being able to type to chat, so people communicate much more and with ease
---
Hooooooo.
---
That's extremely probably what happened, since I indeed moved the CAMP object for convenience.
---
Thank you, now I know I can build there without issue. Great!
---
I've never really explored the elevator. What provides all the lead?
---
I keep changing armour to ultra light build to make it lighter to store, it was then I realised cork is as precious and rare commodity as ballistic fibre lol 😂
---
It's very fun and if you only get a short time to play can be very rewarding.
---
Tailor your play style for short sharp bursts. I would build a rocket tower near a station for quick FT to engagements.
---
I want a to be able to advertise my items and shop thru other players inventory from outside the game. Imagine an app on your phone that's linked to your character and let's you trade while at work... or on the toilet. It could be glorious.
---
There is a 'thru the wall' connector that has parts that will poke out of each side.   You can also use some of the small up and down facing conduits (don't have pics) to go through a ceiling.  I think you need the 'Advanced Power Connectors' plan to unlock these though.
---
Never once did I argue that you don't get max damage with heavy weapons if you aren't wearing power armor. My argument is that anyone in Power Armor is an easier target. I know for sure that I can A) vats them and B) they have low damage mitigation due to not using legendary armor and not being able to use some perks.
---
If you go to one of the elevators and take it to the top floor, walk up the stairs to where the large monorail rings are. Follow the wooden bridge, and by every bridge set are lead weights and concrete bags.
---
That’s 100% all I do. Farm workshops, treasure maps, and rare locations for plans, then sell them for dirt cheap wherever the action seems to be. I’ve set up a lot of shops, usually a new one every week or so. And the shops have evolved in design to look more like a roaming shop. Here are a few of them (I also love editing so some of these are a bit theatrical):
---
[The Mad Hog](https://youtu.be/-R8RE1_b0Mg)
---
[Helvetia Market](https://youtu.be/RTYsTFUBzz4)
---
[Hog Heaven](https://youtu.be/V2axR9SqfFM)
---
And my favorite so far, [The Flying Pig](https://youtu.be/t8xWgjxnc0U)
---
I still love the game. Hopefully the actions of the few don’t ruin it for the many!
---
Just like real life.
---
I did a lot of testing a few weeks ago, so it's possible that Martial Artist was fixed for Unarmed during the last patch, but I haven't noticed a difference with my DCG, that I use a lot.
---
I do use those perks when I'm in a Nuke Zone, and switch to using my Grog Axe, but have not seen any benefit for Unarmed weapons.
---
Cool, how long ago was that? Was it before or after the big vendor change?
---
So true, I started on Friday and had no idea about the rifleman perks when I wanted a handmade build. A lvl 59 told me about them and now I'm leveling perception. I also got to lvl 24 from the double xp weekend and some high level people carrying me through lvl 60 stuff.
---
Yeah I still only have the basic plans for the conduits.  I tried putting one on top of the roof and one under it on the ceiling.  Didn’t work :( I’ll hunt for more plans
---
Oh! Right so they'll have 3 connections. One is power in (aka the master on/off to the whole thing) one is the output (eg on when the counter is 10, or on randomly) and the other is the trigger input (aka "go up one when you get signal here")
---
The only thing I can advise is that 61/61 is BASE stats for Heavy Chest, so unless BoS Mod adds NO ER, that would be Sturdy
---
Theres a rando spawn point by miners Monument. West of the parking lot therea an over turned tractor trailer. Directly across the street is a spawn point. Server hope till you see some laying on the ground.
---
so is there like an example or something that someone would use this for?
---
Happy to help! I feel this needs to be a **PSA** cause I read posts about this daily
---
Yeah, usually I specifically farm docs and just track how many I've picked up, then drop off immediately.
---
Nah it wasn’t long, one or two patches ago. I even have another I grabbed just to stash in case along the way. No idea how the patch today will impact things
---
probably not hacked, just got his perk cards all set out. Post the youtube/twitch link to the exact time of your demise.
---
No problem. Thanks for reading it 😊👍
---
No, you can keep bringing them back over and over again. The trick is to pick up two then drop off immediately.
---
There are lvl 68 gutsy? Im lvl 152 and they always capped at lvl 52 for me.
---
Yes, yes you are! :D (I'm Merrak over there)
---
I seen a video posted on 76 bazaar. A player used it and the server shredded her in under 2 minutes it was pretty nuts. As for stacking i am not at all to sure as i haven't used but will so now cause of that video
---
Thank you, that most kind and helpful of you. :)
---
There are these pipe conducts and one has a connector for wires and these can go through a wall (the vertical thing where one has a connector and one not). You must connect an other pipe to the upper or lower thing and connect a cable to it. These small things even can go through floors. Its fairly hard to know how these things work for connecting stuff but way cleaner than having cables all over the place.   
---
These thing wont pass passive electricity but there is one thing that can do it. This will also glow. Sorry for not knowing the correct names of these things. There are only 2 slots for them, so testing it, wont be wasting much, because you can store them and change the part.   
---
The thing that can go through a wall is kinda hard to get managed but the best i found out is going on the inside and trying to put the thing where the cable goes to the outside.
---
Out of curiosity how do you guys do this data mining and are there any guides out there on how to get started with the tools to do it?
---
I love this lol 😂
---
Terrifying beast.
---
I wish
---
Good idea!! thanks that'll save my ass
---
So agree. That dude with the 100 stimpaks, I love you.
---
I was playing survival for that sweet double xp on a new char and had plenty of fun sneak ambushes. One guy I snuck up on was picking a lock so I sneak up and crit cats him in the head he panics and I murdered him. He was level 45 and i was 20.
---
It's the way I who'd have loved to be helped, so I helping others ^_^
---
...it was aggressively passive!
---
I see the marine dense mod at the watoga bot traders all the time, don’t remember seeing a combat before though...
---
This is gonna be a big one.

To answer your question, no, adding 3 or more does not increase your caps. It stays 40 caps for everything 2 and up.
---
Shaw, a True/Chaotic Neutral Sniper. Based loosely on [the character from Person of Interest](https://personofinterest.fandom.com/wiki/Sameen_Shaw). She prefers to run alone and has no loyalty to any specific faction over another - she works with whoever can get her what she needs in that moment.
---
Shaw lives on the lake across from the Lewisburg Station. [Her CAMP](https://i.imgur.com/O9PFLhg.png) is pretty public but safe from mob spawns so it’s not uncommon to see strangers run through to use her workbenches. She carries two suppressed weapons (Hunter’s Rifle &amp; Handmade) and a Deathclaw Gauntlet and prefers to avoid big conflicts where possible (my build is heavily focused on sneaking and damage dealt when sneaking). Having said that, if she comes across a spawn of low level mobs, they’ll all be dead on the ground before they knew what hit ‘em.
---
She tries not to be greedy during events with others, especially if they’re lower level. And at the end of any event or encounter where we all worked together, she makes sure to thank them with a big Thumbs Up! and maybe drop a “care package” of items she picked up but doesn’t need before she runs off into the trees.
---
She’s very much into landscape photography and captures many of the beautiful, weird, and frightening sights found across Appalachia. [This photo album](https://imgur.com/gallery/ItPV1wi) is the more aesthetic photos and [this one's the weirder ones](https://imgur.com/gallery/jG7GIhs).
---
And lately for some reason, she’s been running into a lot of Mothmen and Flatwoods Monsters. Strange fellows, not very friendly. [Great to take postmortem selfies with](https://imgur.com/licPDLY).
---
Maybe the DCG is bugged? Or else there’s a discrepancy between what the displayed armor via Awareness is, and what the enemy actually takes (IE another bug). 
---
Martial artist is definitely  working for brass knuckles though.
---
Came here to say the same.
---
Glad I’m not the only one
---
They used to,  and still will once on a very great while
---
I’m always blasting the guards.  Sentry bots are my favorite.  Lots of XP and fusion cores.
---
Thanks I’ll give it a go!
---
Bad logic there. What you want is a reason for players to play survival without the reason being overwhelmingly in favor of it. People are always going to choose adventure for stuff like scavving, base building, SBQ, or if they just don’t want to deal with the tension of PvP and long run backs. To encourage survival to be more than just death match, having a solid xp bonus means players who just want to grind levels will help populate the server, and provide for more organic interactions since many people like to farm. Say, west tek, for do. I’ve had more PvP at west tek than anywhere else.
---
Very odd. You’re right that furious adds damage on subsequent shots, but my testing and someone else’s testing indicates the increase is around 5% per shot, which should mean your third shot does 15% more, and cumulatively 30% more (5, 10, then 15). Assassins would only be doing 10% more on every shot; cumulative damage should be the same and the third shot should only be 5% less than Furious.
---
Aren’t you worried lowbies and noobs think you can’t aim for crap? Lolz
---
I ran into someone similar but they decided it was a perfect idea to bankrupt me and kill me and my friend in our workshops Everytime they'd just take our workshops just to combat us knowing well they'd kill us then take the workshop that really upset me since Everytime they killed me I lost caps and me and my friend swore they were hacking since he said one of them 1 hit him with there fists I know that's really Cod 2 ish of saying but It was believable
---
Same, I imagined a cabin made of raider corpses aka Mystery Meat
---
I play almost daily, but have only run into a handful of toxic players. Now at lvl 155, I play with them. I was once at Harpers Ferry and 4 guys came up talking shit trying to pick a fight with me. I just started running circles around them, throwing the heart emoji and just pissed them off even more. They finally gave up and jumped to White Springs. So I started following them around. They hated it and finally asked me to leave them alone. Lol. Not once did i day say word to them, which i think creeped them out. I just give back the annoyance.  Childish, probably. But don't do that to me, or I will annoy you.
---
I agree wholeheartedly. Melee is now meh for pvp.
---
You're an absoulute legend
---
I have a few marine dense got them either watoga or harpers...never seen Combat but I’ve bought before so they must also be there
---
Not for me - survival mode without player markers is the dream. Id love nothing more than 76 with proper stranger danger
---
This game is not for you. Move along.
---
Place one conduit each side of a door or window (inside/out, one edge to the other edge) so they connect through the 'open' space and then 'replace' with the solid wall and it will then have the look of connectors both sides of a solid wall (until it's patched). Also check power limits you need for each water purifier as you may need more generators (or less purifiers) to power them all
---
Watoga and whitespring train station are my drop points
---
If you’re a lowbie and you found a successful way to get there, you get an attaboy!
---
Some new lvl 13 player did well out of me. I intended to drop them a lvl 15 fully modded hunting rifle but dropped them a maxed out 3* AAE Handmade by mistake and didn't notice until jumping servers....17k gift enjoy!
---
Now reality kicks in (prediction):
---
- everyone gets free wallet... 5wt
---
- buy belt pouch 1000 atoms... 10wt
---
- buy handbag 10000 atoms..... 20wt
---
- buy small pack 100000 atoms.... 20wt
---
- buy authentic nylon shopping bag which reduces power armour helmets to zero weight 1000000 atoms..... 30wt
---
Aftermath: Bethesda wonders why more bad press.
---
Ps they still not unbanned couple of us for dupper hunting  and dumping proceeds. Clowns turned biggest fans into Beth haters.
---
I forgot to post my story.
---
Watoga, I love Watoga.....So, I am there walking around in my Weightless gear and admiring the buildings, when all of a sudden I hear a 'pew pew pew' in the distance. I run to one of the little gardens and crouch, but i do not hear any human gunshots. Then I hear the hum of the little cargo drone, so I run up to the roof of one of the buildings along the fire escape and begin to shoot the thrusters. BANG, the little guy 'splodes and the cargo crate drops and starts smoking.....I run down and drop a few cryo-mines near the thing and then run back up to my vantage point and wait....along comes a wary level 130+ guy.....V.A.T.S aimed onto one of the mines....BOOM...then I ran down to finish the job off with a drill just for fun and then grab the small amount of loot.
---
Could it have to do with every 2-3 shots is a crit? My assumption is that furious is applied to the final damage number (including the crit) and not just base weapon damage.
---
Pics or videos?
---
Oh boy, y’all don’t want to play poker with me, it’s not that I’m a sore loser, I’m just damn good at bluffing people out XP
---
True. Missed the post.
---
Never understood why fist weapons were one handed, either. Your attack rate would double, if you just put a knuckle duster/power fist in your left as well. Apparently boxers only use one hand in the Fallout universe? 
---
Shields! Yes. Please. Anything so that people stop one shotting you. 
---
As for bikes, I’d love it. But, I don’t think the engine could handle it. The map is extremely NOT flat, and you’d get caught on everything. It’s not like Skyrim, where you can justify a horse being janky in movement. I wish they could have them, though.
---
Probably just pics, might do a video if I’m not busy/lazy
---
They probably couldn’t survive in PVP so they decide to act like the big fish in a small pond.
---
I really can’t get my head round their mentality when they do stuff like that.  It doesn’t achieve anything, yet they persist.  Some people act very odd to the point where you start thinking something ain’t upstairs if you know what I mean.
---
My tip for survival is to throw Molotovs at my feet every hour so i dont appear in the top 3 and get killed and loose 80% of my stimpacks
---
All of them exist but they have a very low drop rate. Expect to have a lot of 40mm grenades before you see one.
---
I kinda did the same, kept sending them heart emotes lol
---
I’m a part time raider, more of an opportunist, actually spend most of my time helping lower levels by giving them supplies. So I’ll “raid” if find a camp by looting unlocked stuff, but that happens maybe once a week 😂
---
the thing is if they break promises what else will they do? anyways if they add these kits people wont trust them anymore with FO76 even more making the future of FO76 far far more bleeker i would like to see this game live longer than the wastelanders DLC
---
Noted for later 😁
---

are you my mummy?
---
So there's two things to bear in mind with workshop power. This comes from fo4, and is the same for workshops &amp; camps.
---
Some connectors *radiate* power and some items required power to be *radiated* to them. Other connectors directly send power and some items require *direct* connection.
---
Items that require "radiated" power will show that they require power when you look at them (the lightning bolt) but they won't have a number. This means they need a power radiator nearby but they do not subtract from your power "budget" (generator output). These items are typically lights. In the basic set of power connectors, the only way you can provide "radiated" power is by those handy wall connectors (the ones that can be wall, roof or floor). 
---
So as an example, let's say you have some lights in a small room, if you connect a power connector to the roof within a reasonable radius of all these lights, and connect that to a source of power, they will all light up.
---
Secondly, you have direct power connections. These also have the lightning bolt symbol but they always need a wire *directly* connected to them. The number indicates how much power they subtract from the network.
---
Regarding how the power networking works, it's super simple. If you create a network of connectors or generators or pylons or whatever you want, the entire network instantly shares all its power with the entire rest of the network. Switches can isolate branches of the network and you can create multiple networks, but generally it's best to just connect every item via some way back to your generators. If your generators pump out less power than you're consuming, the items furthest from the power sources will lose power first.
---
I hope that helps!
---
Guess it depends on the level difference and perk cards. But yeah. I would of just server hopped after the first go around
---
Wow, 16 players and we barely did damage to her in the time span for Scorched Earth..
---
Im always making items for the lower levels: (will be using the Overseers Camp for this from now on)
---
Weapons:
---
Hunting Rifle - hardened w/Stinging mag, silencer, a full stock, and a Dot recital
---
Shotgun - hardened  and full stock
---
Armor:
---
Mainly Leather - all pocketed and deep pocketed
---
Other Armor - if I have any that I picked up from a quest I fix, most of them.
---
The Items that I place are usually levels 1-10, I also use the Fix it Perks for Armor and Weapons so I drop off 200% condition weapons with ammo and some health items.
---
Yup.  Gulpers are pesky.  
---
I came across a spawn of Colonel Gutsys at Watoga HS the other day.  Does someone need to kick my ass?  Yeah they pretty much did.  10-12 of them just went crazy on me.  Thankfully my AA handmade and tank killer were in effect.
---
Are you using an armor bench or the power armor stand?
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/TangibleHelplessSoybeanPartyTime
---
Hopefully I’m just shit and I’m wrong 🙂
---
Honestly I was level 101 at the time and usually a passive aggressive player but at that point I just left and hoped to never encounter people like that again
---
You have to craft it at a power armor station and you must have that specific set of power armor that it applies to. I think you do it in space/modify option, click paint/standard paint/no paint, whatever the mod slot is for that piece and then you can select it in a list. It can't be crafted at a normal armor bench. Maybe you are getting them confused?
---
You even said it man “ultracite paint SKIN”. You need to own a suit or the armor so you can paint it. They aren’t going to sell you a full suit of power armor in the shop!
---
Agreed, I never understood how people get enjoyment out of toxicity. Don't get me wrong, Me and my buddies love giving each other grief and picking on each other when we play FPS and BR type games but it's all in good fun and isn't toxic or degrading.
---
Toys, fans, typewriters, wendigos, many super mutants.
---
by the workbench at a couple of train stations.
---
On the shelf at many pegboards.
---
couple boxes at grafton steel.
---
Great guide, what exactly do the food items buff?
---
&gt; **FIRECAP SOUP, RADRAT Skewer, Wolf Ribs &amp; Razorgrain Soup**
---
I agree with this guy. The way the game currently works allows all sorts of playstyles , like I said in my other comment if you really don't want to show on the map all it takes is a suicide or sneak all the time. People can manhunt people if they wish etc.
---
Run the "Mistress of Mystery" questline. Not only is it a great story, you'll wind up with a really nice Armor Piercing legendary sword that makes melee much easier, even without perks.
---
It drops raider armor plans, raider underarmer protected / shielded plans, Whitesprings and whitepowder jumpsuits all of which tend to be extremely rare.
---
in the middle of the map, so that fast trips do not go so expensive
---
I envy you
---
So to answer your main question, your generators do need to be directly wired up to the rest of your network. You can only "wirelessly" send power to end items
---
Next year’s Christmas atom skins will make your camp a Gingerbread House
---
Says the raider.., 😂😝
---
That's a good answer! 👍 Cause I'm at level 22 and someday I will be able to do this event for the first time. So I would be happy to get some tips on "How do I behave correctly when I make this event for the first time?" 😊 cause I don't want to make other players feel mad at me... So why not grab the chance before this event to ask how and to prevent any kind of stress... 😊
---
I will have to do some more testing, I have 3* Instigating versions of every Unarmed weapon, (mostly +40% SS), but the DCG is by far the deadliest.
---
Right where the Turkey is on the map is an obstacle course that is actually kinda difficult (without mutations).  I’d bet caps on who could run it the fastest!!
---
There are though a place like on the outskirt of whitespring where there's usually a few lvl 50 robots, an assaultron and sometimes a sentry bot that all give xp.
---
Think it's some kind of parkinglot with a tiny white house for maybe some employe.
---
He sounds great 😂😃
---
That's about all you can do in this case.  Server hop and maybe block them.  I've had it happen to my low level alt a few times.  They never do it to my level 170 guy though for some reason ;)
---
And this is why I play without a headset. Just really don't want to have the game ruined.
---
I got 11 40 mm rounds just as I saw your comment.
---
Gonna be honest...that’s all it looks like they did for the sheepsquatch model to me too. 🙄
---
 Game dev's dont make it hard at all,..  
---
And its pretty self explanatory, you need to have said *armour* and paint it at a power arnour station.
---
yea I agree , I like the way the game works currently although I do think more people should show on the map, like top kills and longest life, there should also be rewards for the leaderboards, because atm being on the leaderboard literally has no incentive if you say give that person 200 caps for every 30 mins they are alive on the leaderboard or something else maybe people won't see it as such a burden. Maybe add killstreaks so you get a multiplier on caps the more people you kill once you reach a certain killstreak.
---
Ill take the radaway my guy im allways in need of that
---
Honestly, not that I can provide. They're really really niche
---
I suppose you could use the laser tripwire connected to a counter connected to another counter connected to a siren to play a sound when the 100th person visits your camp, for example.
---
Unfortunately i dont play on xbox, but i think its really nice of you making an effort to put your unwanted stuff to good use.
---
I’ll take your radaway and shotty shells
---
And some random of those weapons. Gamer tag is ExiledBridge2
---
the combat dense and marine dense were both available as plans and mods, mainly in Watoga, however, Bethesda programmed both plans with the very same name. It took me countless server hops to have even one of them show up in Watoga, not to mention the fact that I kept getting the wrong one (again, couldn't tell if it was combat or marine until you bought it, and tried to learn it before the (known) patch came out).  After the vendor overhaul, they removed both of the plans from vendors, made the combat dense extremely hard to find,  but kept the marine mod readily available.
---
Put a couple on the top and run wires to them. One on each end of the roof should provide power to any lights on the underside.
---
Nah, not really.. Just an Aussie helpin' other aussies and kiwis out.
---
Super magic can we split the radaway im out atm
---
It isn't 100% proven, but it isn't just an idea I thought up. It seems that the RNG is based on character names, and those with spaces were screwing up the RNG numbers or something along those lines. Here is some more info and people talking about it:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/av9nrl/broken_rng_for_my_characters/
---
Wait, you think that "reduce, reuse, recycle" is an iCarly reference....holy fuck.
---
Radaway getting split between ace and magic.
---
U can buy them with atoms . Stop it with your crybaby propaganda
---
You haven't watched Juicehead if that's what you think.
---
Would be the perfect game to have it, because aiming is poop for everyone anyway. 
---
Won't happen though.
---
I've found the same with Whitesprings also.  Some trips there is a legendary every 5 or 6 ghouls but most other trips there might be one in the entire place.
---
Be aware you cannot equip the DGC if you are in PA.
---
I have a (L45, I think) standard DCG - with incisor 3 and swing speed perks - it does about 150 per swing.
---
I vote yes to that.
---
Im cool with that when do we trade
---
Don't let the a-holes ruin the game for you.  There really aren't that many of them.  I shied away from playing with a headset for a while as well, but I really enjoy talking to other players like 99.9% of the time.
---
I just sent you a friend request. I’m in game now
---
I’ll take the lever gun if you can hold onto it for a little bit longer for me?
---
Sure thing
---
Dang. I'm level 28 and I haven't even seen Whitesprings. God I'm chicken.
---
Are ypu lukewarmlovegel
---
You say Chicken, I say Alive.... 👍
---
Getting on now
---
I miss looonnnggg dogs. :(
---
It looks to me, like he used VATS. Give that a try sometime. 👍
---
What time, does the update shut everything down, usually?
---
Well, after a few hours of farming I finally got the knight paint! Thank you all so very much.
---
Seconded....and probably infinitied....even if there is no such word!
---
It's not really about the repair kits. It's about how Bethesda has been treating FO76 and their customers as a whole.
---
Where at
---
Damn, I am an idiot lol
---
  I was amused when dropping the explosive bait resulted in no grenade type boom, but instead, a mustard colored cloud...
---
no dead critters,
---
 and a completed quest task :)
---
There are rewards for being on the leaderboards. You get to be map marker. You get to lure people in. Yesterday I decided to test that, found a great location, build a camp in the most exposed spot, and his myself there. Two of my buddied took lookout points with great map control over my position. The people who went after me effectively entered ambush. I counted three different groups of people and like two random lone PvPers interacting together and competing for an hour only because I utilised the map marker to define my playground. Left the place much richer and full of aid.
---
Come to flat woods im there
---
Yeah basically in the same boat except my build isn't strong enough to really get any enjoyment out of it. I definitely needs a ton of work. My best guess would be for them to set characters for survival apart from adventure. It's just to much trying to fight a level 238 who still has Tse weapon or uses chameleon and stealth boys. 
---
Although I definitely see that there is enjoyment to be had with survival I've written it off completely until they make some serious changes.
---
I would like the bobble heads. But I will be home 10:30 ish ET. So it would need to be post patch which I will be on right when the server reopens. If that is all right with you. GT is BigBangTheory73. Add if you want. Thanks!
---
Hey, no worries. It happens to all of us at some point.
---
Just been on for about an hour trying to trigger the responder vendor bot anyway I got tired went to whitesprings to do some level grinding. Say to myself hopefully someone nukes it. Just as I got there. Like 3 seconds. Someone launched a nuke on it. Got my last cobalt!
---
Very creative. Cool
---
For sure! Real heros right there.
---
My main character is named Pills and he’s a Raider, mostly because I like the aesthetics. In fact, he’s more like a dirty scavenger, and got engaged in PvP less than 5 times in 140 levels... He’s also a shotgunner who like explosives, meat and chems. He’s hopeful he can become a successful drug dealer after today’s update, but I doubt that will work, he loves his drugs too much.  
---
My new character is called Sanity and is pretty happy and healthy for now. She soon will be a one-handed-melee tank in a crazy mind, but she’s doesn’t know it yet. She’s level 8, still persuaded she can save the world.
---
I stream and I like talking to people even if they don't talk back, I always part ways with a "Farewell Lonesome wonder!"
---
considering that the display station from FO4 is literally already in the game in the Garrahan Mining building (where you get and do the Excavator quest) I guess until now they were just too lazy to give us the option or are holding it back to add it later on as a feature on the roadmap
---
They’re all yours.  No rush.
---
I only use power armor when Ineed to hoof it back home but thanks for letting me know.
---
Hold down options button then highlight his name and select block for session.
---
I’m on PS4 too if you wanna add me my name is DymanicFilms (not dynamic, long story but it was spelt wrong on purpose lol)
---
Wait ultron is canon in fallout? Jk
---
[Me too!](https://i.imgur.com/4r2ZFZF.jpg)
---
Looks like he's a baaaaAAAAAaaAAaaAAaad boy
---
That’s also odd, because on paper the power fist should be (slightly) better. Same damage (when both are modded) but power fist gets a small amount of extra armor piercing from it’s mod.
---
Cool thanks I will message you when the servers come back up!
---
with all due respect, git gud scrub - j/k I don't play survival at all. But I have learned a little just from reading this board.
---
You have a lot of misconceptions about how this game works. X01 armor is \*not\* tanky enough, anyone with a decent anti armor or instigating rifle will poink you in the head and one shot you. You're fighting people with sentinel armor on which just absolutely negates damage. So you have to do some whitespring runs until you get that.
---
Also the deathclaw gauntlet experience should teach you that survival is all about stealth. You can have more success getting the chameleon mutation and wearing all weightless armor than in sentinel (or the x01).
---
If everyone’s got an entire stash box full of legendary stuff to scrap or sell for tokens then there’s going to be a long que....... il be taking a picnic with me lol
---
I got mine on top of Seneca Rocks but more and more people are placing their campus there.
---
Lol yeah I was running through low on food seen a radrat taking on some tatos was going to kill the rat but that failed killed the plant got a bounty ended up in a shoot out with the guards was doing good tell someone collected on the 5cap bounty. Guerilla warfare just pull them into plasma mines. Wait for them to over heat hit them in the back with armor penetrating troubleshooter legendary. Open them up.
---
I tried making a joke and it blew up in my face. my bad chief.
---
Crossplay between consoles would probably be fine but i would not want it with PC because of the different input methods, different settings and hackers/modders etc
---
Yeah I've been hopping a few places, ill keep this one in mind, thank you.
---
on the special screen, check the column headers.  
---
Does one of them have "1 unused pt" in yellow text?
---
When would you like to hop on?
---
I have become cognizant and use my normal rifle and just tag them once so others can also get hits on the legendaries as well. I never realized earlier what I was doing and I think there are many of us that honestly didnt know about the game dynamics by just one shooting them. Now I have seen the dicks at work and they just suck!
---
Maybe divide the plans up by the category such as barrels, stocks?
---
I meant assaultron
---
76 has no text chat on PC, either. I'd assume Xbone probably just has more children. 
---
And children... children being assholes never changes.
---
K, I hate them because they never frickin drop the assaultron circuit board
---
I really think its random.  Like a few days ago I was at whitesprings.   I'm a lvl 75 VATS rifle build.  The other dude was a lvl 58 assuming melee wearing a deathclaw gauntlet.  WS has a abundance of legendarys that trip (I counted at least 10, all 1 star).  I saw him, he saw me, I was using a armor piercing sniper with 50% limb damage.  Once he realized that I was sniping their legs and incapacitating them he would back off, lemme slow them down, then run in for the kill.  He and I tag teamed 30+ ghouls like that and both got the rewards.  Never teamed up, never used our mics, just understood each other.
---
And then some people are just oblivious.  Or 14 year old trigger happy kids.  Get a mic and yell at them, try to explain what your doing.
---
I like using the locker at Sutton myself
---
Not sure if it mattered but I was only able to get 1 hat a day. That might just be in my head though but i got a skeleton mask and no matter how many jumls never seen anything till the next day it was the civil war hat
---
Thats cold man. Genius too!
---
Thanks, they were just random examples I ate yesterday but they helped significantly. I would always reccomend just scanning the stats panel now and again to see active effects.
---
I dont have them all so i will give examples.
---
Radstag steaks give +20 carry weight. Very very useful.
---
Wolf ribs give +2 Perception and +45health
---
Radrat steaks give health regen
---
Simple Soot flower tea gives - Max AP +10
---
The diff variations and the more.exotic meats and plants give better results.
---
10am est
---
What do they do?
---
Considering how low the player base is this would help for sure
---
I agree, I've got a level 150 somethingish in adventure, I rolled a new character for survival and I have to say that I don't understand why people are using their 100+ level mains for survival.  It is way more fun and interesting to roll a completely new character with no help at all from your other main(s) and go at it anew.  With a few exceptions of course I feel like a lot of the things that make the game more difficult, survival and with rolling a new character, definitely make it more fun.  If you have only played survival with a maxed out character, roll a new one and vow to only use them in survival and in no way loot share with your other characters.  It'll make you fall in love with the game all over again.
---
Good question.  I used to all the time, but I've been saving a lot here lately and using it or leaving it for newbies since the food spoilage increase.  I know you can still sell raw flux. I'll have to see this evening when I get on.
---
Nope this game is really bad stay away from it and these are my reasons.
---
1. I logon so I can do a quick White Spring run and I am still doing that run a hour later.
---
2. I meet a lot of nice players I really dislike meeting polite people this is the wasteland.
---
3. I wasted so many days just exploring all the awesome locations who has time for that.
---
4. Let's talk about shelter you can build your C.A.M.P almost anywhere I hate this freedom because I keep finding great camp locations then I have to rebuild a better camp total waste of time.
---
5. This game has cost me personal time I had a cold so i stayed home from work so I would not infect anyone at work I was lucky I had this game to keep me busy.
---
Or Agility for guitar, Strength for Drums, etc. Everyone could master some instrument!
---
Can I grab some of those fusion cells?
---
How about you take ALL those fusion cells? :D gamertag?
---
I was inside shopping and scrapping materials once when a team mate outside decided to attack a lone guard, next thing I know the bots inside are attacking me like I just tried to shoplift. It wasn't till I respawned that I realized what he had done.
---
Where's the guy who made a piano from pencils and clipboards?
---
On the cliff side west of The Top Of The World for a view, closed of space that rarely gets attacked.
---
Just east of Site Bravo for yet another view and LOTS of flat land.
---
Just west of Valley Galleria, there’s a hole in the main road, but you need Marsupial Mutation or a Jetpack to get out again, but path finding makes it difficult for structures to receive damage.
---
I believe there is a mountain north of The Top of The World and east of the Monangah Power Plant there is the highest point in the game to build on.
---
I REALLY like that it looks like we’ll be able to craft new armor and weapons from Sheepsquatch remains. They really oughta retroactively add new things to craft from other Cryptid remains- lord knows Id love a Wendigo Gauntlet, or like a cloak made from Mothman wings.
---
Oh damn. Savage friend!
---
I bought my grape last night, 36 caps. The only thing was they only sell you one at a time :(
---
I will forever be in your debt gettin on soon for some trades and I’ll join ur game GT ATXlien
---
What what do you do when you become top 3?
---
I live near Pleasant Valley station. Just over the road there is small river with ore vein nearby.  Quite a nice spot.
---
LukewarmLoveGel. See ya soon!
---
You really just need FO76Edit, which you can find on the Nexus.
---
yep , today
---
Happens to me all the time in the junkyard near vault 76
---
Ok, it's  something I'll keep in mind.
---
When ?
---
The outdoor couch on the overlook above Whitespring at sunset is a nice place.
---
The Servers will be down in 2 hours. So lets see when they are back.
---
Would be great. I don't know anyone who plays on PC and somehow this game manages to make you feel more desolate than any single-player RPG out there.
---
Login screen says when the game is going down for maintenance and update.
---
10am Eastern
---
nope, they’ve been ignoring every post about it
---
Yes, please!
---
Upside: no Brexit.
---
Yeah.... it is rather disappointing for sure....
---
I can craft all Dense mods on PC. You can learn it by plan.
---
Nope, that works as intended. Basically anything in a workshop area, is considered temporarily owned by that play for as long as they held that location.  
---
in short: You ***stole*** from that player and deserve to be made wanted.
---
I'm trying to open at least 3 lvl locks since you can get a lot of maps and plans from them. Now If near workbench is claimed by another player you can't loot the place - stupid...
---
Word of warning, you can only hand in one at a time, if you have 5 in your inventory you will deposit them all in one go and it will only count as one. You can no longer put spares in your stash so don’t buy more than 1 at a time, hand it in then repeat. For free tech data head to the Enclave bunkers military wing and check all the desks, there’s often up to 3 in that area and you can find them randomly in safes too.
---
ops wrong post ha
---
In the real wasteland we’d all be playing as the skeletons, so that’s neither here nor there...
---
For real, I went from minding my business at Tinkers work bench to getting the "minority in small southern town" treatment, running for my life as assaultrons and Mr Gutsys persued me. As I'm screaming "WTF happened" my friend is laughing hysterically. 
---
It was made worse by the fact that I had just equipped two pieces of auto-stim armor. So not only am I going to have trouble going to pick up my loot but I burned through several stim packs before getting the armor off
---
They’re for the quest Forbidden knowledge
---
When I do this one, if I see it first, I tag it, wait until I think everyone else has hit it and then get to finishing it.  I'm the one level 100+ without a TSE though, so maybe I'm weird.
---
It’s actually the opposite. The goo piles doesn’t have physics. If you killed them in the air there’s a good chance there’s a goo pile floating in the air. And goo piles are invisible from below....
---
Wow! I can’t believe it doesn’t have text chat, that’s pretty wild tbh. 
---
Also, surprisingly, I’ve never met any children playin, that’s not to say that there aren’t but I don’t think there are a lot of kids playing FO76 fr. The youngest age group I meet is 18-20 yr olds
---
Thanks for letting me know 👍
---
You should never be surprised to be hunted for even a 1 cap bounty.
---
I learned the dense plan by scrapping. I also buy the mods from vendors. Check Harper's Ferry and Watoga vendors for marine or combat armor mods.
---
I think it was initially a stability thing maybe? But they seem to be adding other display items so maybe we are gonna get it soon.
---
Anywhere you like! You're looking for water, valuable plant resources, and convenient travel time to the parts of the map you go to most
---
I believe the Base damage is the same, but the Extra Claw Mod on the DCG pushes it over the PF, but I have the Heated Coil Mod on the PF, looking for the Spiked mod, I sold all of mine.
---
You don't convince me it's good mechanic - I perfectly understand to not touch anything build by the players who claimed the workstations, but the containers that are there forever?!?!
---
I’ve got 2 but the second is just a mule/fast travel point/perk sharer/Empath sharer/Herd Mentality+Strange in Numbers booster. My main account has all my play characters.
---
Its all such unbalanced piece of s...
---
So mad about this stuff. Because of all this mess PvP is useless at the moment.
---
It would be nice..but, it'll never happen
---
I hope that people who think that X01 is tanky will not get to decide how survival will end up.
---
You build couldn't be good if you think X01 was any protection.
---
I'm not trying to bash you, but I am just very tired with people who don't know how to win here saying how it should be. I'll post some tips in the end. I'm a bloody sneaker with one of my chars. Playing him, mastering him, seeing him against my opponents - that puts me, and people like me, in position to discuss wheter and how things should be nerfed for that particular build. People who can't take me down are in no such position. And I should be nerfed tbh, automatic rifles should get the crit shots penetrating effects (as it is now) but should not get the basic x2 damage modifiers in their shoots, increasing the survivability of most other builds from half second up to like four seconds. I can say that because I know how it feels to play such character and how it feels to play against your equals. This will still be an awesome character with such change.
---
People for which the top tier of predators aint equals will not make survival better with their ideas. Lots of the anti-griefer ideas would in fact benefit griefers the most.
---
Respec for combat rifles. Leave the vats perks they will be useful. Get 3x3 commando and tank killer perks. Get yourself any automatic fire bloodied weapon, even one star will do. Get yourself a set of unyielding armor, one star tol for starters. Now you should be able to compete given how current math works. Stay sneaky all the time. This game is super complicated and players that put hundreds of hours into research will always dominate, whatever the situation would be, fresh start would only make it worse. What I specified is not the best nor the only way to play this game. Its just the single cheapest one to be able to hunt the big guys when played smart.
---
Astounishing, why won't they learn communication is everything?
---
 However,  I've got a bunch on my character and she can stand there and sell them to you one at a time by the schematic slot?
---
take you time, explore, enjoy the graphics.  
---
Follow the overseeers quest line, learn the lore.
---
Do the quest and events in the forest.
---
scrap stuff, especially extra weapons you pick off critters you hve killed.
---
Slow but sure:
---
Stay in the forest (green area of the map, western side) until about L15, then start toward toxic valley (northwest, above the Forest).
---
At 25, start the western side of the divide (center section) and the ash heap (southwest on the map).
---
Parts of the divide and all points west will have higher level enemies.
---
The divide wil level up enemies depending on if a high level player has been around.  (If you are an L7, and you start seeing eneies in the 40s 50's, you are in an area you probably shouldnt yet be,)
---
Whitesprings can be extremely hazardous to your health until you get into the upper 20s, even then, it can be very dangerous unless you have a good weapon.
---
I you hear a train whistle, hear a warning about a nuke launch, or see an onscreen  note, check your map.  If you are inside the red circle, put on PA, a rad suit, or get out of the area, post haste.  (THe forest isnt nuked often, but it does happen)

I got really lucky playing 76. My brother started in the beta and was lvl 50 when I bought the game. He showed me the ropes and only recently did I stop being so greedy and realized that I got so lucky. My spots are the overseers camp, flat woods stash and sometimes I wait around on chairs at early mission locations and such. It feels good to give back and I figured out a way to seem like a ghost. Dropping and getting attention then going invisible. It’s fun and sometimes I even team up and show them the ropes too. For the newbies and even some more experienced players, if you see high levels don’t be afraid to go up to them and say hi! A lot of us are nice and the ones who aren’t can’t hurt you as long as you don’t fight back. Stay safe out there wanderers^U^
---
And me and my axe
---
It post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland, why not a Thunderdome. TWO MEN ENTER, ONE MAN LEAVES!
---
I need to do the quest 1st but that would be awesome
---
And my girlfriend, she couldn’t really handle the play style until I bought her fallout 4 last year, now she’s a higher level than me, on both games.
---
I was treated pretty well by some high levels when I was a newbie, and I appreciated it as well.  I am now level 86 and I truly enjoy clunking up to a new player while I am fully decked out in PA and seeing their surprise when I drop a care package for them. Made several new friends this way.
---
I hope the player base can continue to keep it this way the majority of the time.  
---
:)
---
I have a character with a stack of them that hasn’t even started the BoS quest yet. What’s the best way to use all of them if I can’t put the extras in my stash? Could I drop the extras, hope other people don’t come by, turn 1 in, pick 1 back up, etc...
---
Those explody energy weapons are freaking unicorns now. Double or triple whatever you think they're worth.
---
I’m just excited to be cleaning up my stash box
---
Survival? People desperate for explosive stuff so TSE guns are suddenly not trash?
---
X01 jet packs and x01 calibrated shocks. And top hat plans. Ha
---
Or EU, so everyone wins.
---
It's a probability for Xbox, but Sony is so goddamn proprietary about its online service that it's not likely.
---
And you don't understand me.. When it's claimed. That location is owned by that player who has temporarily claimed it. You can contest the area and lay claim to the safe without consequence, or you can accept the punishment for ***stealing.***
---
I’ll be on around noon
---
Nice lol, truely a terrifying beast.
---
Does anyone know what's gonna be added this time? Because I'm starting to become very bored. I'm not sure I can make to 100+... we definitely need more side quests
---
I second this.
---
Sounds good!
---
I would highly doubt that it would stack. Bethesda is is way too smart for that. At least I think they are.
---
Bully Hunger 69 has entered the chat
---
How much for it
---
Ha very true
---
Just up the hill from the freak show is a good area with water supply (savage divide). Good central location
---
He must’ve had a terrible experience with Xbox, with over 5 lvl 150+ characters and 1 lvl 300 I can confirm Xbox is amazing, I myself must be the father of half the BoS paints on Xbox and fusion generators, I’ll constantly come across people al lot eager to help, I keep a base near overseers and often go in and put a full set of lvl 20 heavy BoS Combat armour in a bag in overseers, you’ll be shocked how many people will just add more and more low lvl gear into that bag, on one particular occasion I came to it found my armour set Their and a SS instigating sledgehammer aswell as a vampires explosive hunting rifle both lvl 20 along with 50 stims and 30 Radaway. A lvl 21 soon came along and asked if it was mine I said it’s all for you if you want it, he was over joyed, nearly blew my ears out.
---
It's amazing how much of the map I haven't seen because of this. I went to top of the world once and had to run away from a level 60 Bloodbug while setting off various mines.
---
I wonder about tank killer too....wish u had the numbers.
---
I fell like it dosent do anything sometimes...just based on my pve
---
It says at 10 am EDT, which is in 1 hour and 7 minutes as in writing of this comment
---
Exactly
---
Not sure how to respond to that.. lol
---
Thank you everyone! What I have determined is this: The MODS can be bought at Watoga with some server hopping, or found in the game world. The PLANS are much, much rarer, and cannot be bought from vendors. :) Happy hunting!
---
I understand you, but still think it's stupid mechanic. That's my opinion and you have right to not agree with me, same as I have right to don't agree with you. 
---
In your opinion it work's as intended, in my opinion it's stupid mechanic, especially for player who avoid PvP in any form and want to just explore and loot new locations.
---
Report him for harassment!
---
Why does Bethesda Ignore these posts. Made one like this myself. I want to enjoy this mode. No fast Travel and real Danger with Players. Sounds like a real Adventure, but as you described it - thats my story aswell. I play as a Brotherhood of Steel Player .. so Power Armor and Gatling Laser Im dead in this Mode in 1 to 2 Shot without a Chance to fight back... its more than lame.
---
Hit me up. CRONIC_HEADSHOT is my Xbox name. I may have an extra schematic also I forget if I do or not. I will be on around 4pm Pacific time
---
No word that I know of.
---
I think having melee even remotely as effective as a rifle is so strange.  There's a reason we use rifles in combat.
---
Anti armor gatling? Morningwood0917
---
Yeah we looked at the numbers my dumb self just forgot to write it down at that point. I think that was when we noticed that the mod for ranged didnt do anything.
---
All yours. Adding you now
---
I'm on Xbox, thanks though. As for perks, sure! I try to mostly rely on Agility/Luck. I VATS most my shots and try to get criticals as fast as possible. I have a lot of AP regen and perks that help rifles (but I switch to shotgun perks if I run out of .308 ammo, which happens a lot). I usually have some terminal/lock picking perks active but I really wish Bethesda would just simplify all 3 levels into 1 card for 1 point and just level-lock the higher tiers.
---
I drop off any and all stuff I do not need, especially plans to help the new guys out, wish this was being done when I first came out of the vault
---
Indeed.  
---
Live by this simple mantra and you'll avoid all pvp scenarios.. *"If its yours, it's a good cause... If its not, better not touch"*  
---
Have a good evening.
---
I've been looking for higher level players in the lobby to message to help me out, but most don't respond. Hoping to get into a lobby with some players that are willing to stick around a while.
---
Not sad at all. It's a great escape. 👌
---
You are absolutely fine to craft that much ammo. People have proven you don't get banned for crafting large amounts of items. Even people there were banned weren't banned for the hundreds of thousands of regular ammo they had but rarer ammo like ultracite.
---
Reddit doesn't ban or unban players.
---
Stupid part is that's it's easy to do.
---
I agree that in PvP, PC vs console might not be a great idea.  I haven't had any experience with the subject personally, but it's a pretty well-known issue that I've heard about a lot.
---
PvE I see no reason at all to worry about the differences, it's not competitive, so if one person is slightly more reactive than another, it shouldn't really be a problem.
---
Your friend being 1hit with fists is quite possible without hacks. Brass knuckles are Unarmed weapons that, if unmodded, are almost unnoticeable (and even modded are barely noticeable). They don’t do quite as much damage as, say, a DCG, but on a high-damage character against a player who isn’t built for PVP, they still do more than enough to oneshot you.
---
Took me an hour to kill a 68 deathskull scorpion once up there .. shoot... run up tower... shoot, run up tower. Repeat....
---
If it happens in Watoga, don't forget to check the roofs nearby.  I've found the bodies up there
---
And I can restock getting on now
---
I've run that event a few times but I never think I had enough acid to smelt it so I always drop the rewards since my Stash is full.
---
I thought you had to whittle down their health wait for it to regenerate then do it again before they dropped a 3 star item. Otherwise you get a one star drop. 
---
Is this correct?
---
Awesome thank you
---
Oh, alright. I never tried meleeing in Power Armor, I just have a sword to melee low level enemies to save ammo. I ran out of fusion cores yesterday (I never really collected them because of inventory space) but I will start looking for them to save ammo.
---
Chems and booze mainly. Hoping that these buffs will actually become usefull in the dungeons/raids coming out..
---
Did BGS even acknowledge here that text chats are coming or more blah blah we are looking into it ie don't call us we'll call you and our people will schedule lunch with your people kk thanks byyyeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Power fist has slightly more base damage. Puncturing Power fist and Extra Claw DCG have the same damage, but Puncturing adds some moderate amount more of armor piercing.  I can craft Puncturing on PC
---
I spend far more time giving low level players plans and stuff than playing the game. I’m dressed as a witch and always carry a spare witch and skeleton costume to pass on, as they took me days to get and would have loved them from the beginning. Always pass on low level guns, ammo, food, water,stimpaks and screws and springs as you need loads of them at the beginning. Just need an emote to say look in the bag as most newbies miss it. I’ll never forget the first person to pass stuff on to me which was loads of bobble heads and it made my day so just passing it on.
---
I know xo1 isn't tanky armour, but in that situation it was far more tanky than my leather armour. I understand how to win, my issue isn't that, my issue is once again there is a meta that makes everything else pretty much shit. If you don't use a bloodied rifle build or bloodied melee build you get use to being at the bottom. This is suppose to be a roleplaying game first, not a rust or ark clone where one play style is king.
---
Why is this my most upvoted post lmao
---
I
---
Hey maybe that will be used in the new update and now you know an important location!
---
If I don't already have it lying around somewhere, I'll put my next few points into White Knight. Thanks!
---
For awhile I was using the "come over here!" type emoji but the real low level players would run away more often than not. I guess it seemed like a trick
---
This page has information on it.   [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1DeZX4Po9S2ApD1Sr4Tosu/inside-the-vault-lying-lowe-questline-preview-and-patch-8-highlights](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1DeZX4Po9S2ApD1Sr4Tosu/inside-the-vault-lying-lowe-questline-preview-and-patch-8-highlights) 
---
Today we get a new questline called Lying Lowe, in which we find some cryptids. Vendors for every faction except the Enclave are inside the Whitespring resort. The vendor cap pool is now global at 1400 caps rather than 200 per faction.
---
Next week. [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eQmVlhbjlkX0GzGb7DB3j/inside-the-vault-looking-beyond-patch-8-april-4-2019](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eQmVlhbjlkX0GzGb7DB3j/inside-the-vault-looking-beyond-patch-8-april-4-2019) 
---
Player vending was moved to next week. We get a dungeon called The Burrows. A new in-game camera is added and there will be quests for it.
---
cause theyre gonna plug their ears when they hear initial backlash and when they release it and everyone hates it, then they “received an unexpected reaction” to it
---
I agree the stealth boys are very problematic, not being able to vats makes a close fight difficult for a sniper. My only weapon I carry is a Bloodied explosive gauss, so the aoe helps out when I have to panic spam on a dancing fool lol. I got lucky by getting my armor set pieced together, but I built the sniper build from the time I started the game. Once I knew the capabilities of the legendary bonuses, I got the courage to go full bloodied, but before it was a harder decision.
---
Honestly, what they should do is make the Enclave mask into a full helmet like those worn by the NRC Rangers in Fallout New Vegas, but with more of an Enclave style to them
---
Bug or working as intended?
---
have you ever noticed after killing a sentry bot, it says you can loot like 200 of .556 ammo, but after you loot it, it never goes to your inventory?
---
😂😂
---
I don't know, seems like since I connected the spotlight I see xp popping up as if I got a kill more often, if I wander for 2 or 3 hours, 3 or 4 times I'll see it, maybe I'm hitting an enemy I didn't see in the waste land and somebody comes along later and kills it?
---
I just did this on the weekend, there was a level 5 and 6 together in a camp. They didn't seem to get it and kept walking away, I picked it up, followed them and dropped the stuff again, still no. I gave up and found another guy who was lvl 8 I think, one of the items a lvl15 lengedary ghoul slayer Handmade and I had even tricked it out with all the good mods I use, he took it and heart emoted. Might have been an alt, but he picked it up and I could finally get on with gaming again.
---
I am at the point where I collect so many legendary items I can't sell any more and don't have the stash space, so I often just leave legendary items in the cash register at the big store in White Springs, that and plans/recipes. But if I get a lower level legendary like that, I'd rather give it to someone who might use it, rather than leave it for someone to pickup and sell to a vendor.
---
It just works.
---
Wait, what Shear Terror.
---
Is this somehow related to the upcoming patch?
---
Sounds good, I'l start grabbing those perks. My only worry is that I won't have room to keep them all equippped without removing the perks that help me fight. I really wish I could completely re-spec.
---
Thank you! I was worrying about a way to easily get fusion cores, and I was running dangerously low. I just thought they removed fusion cores from the loot table of those robots long ago.
---
I haven't tried it. As it has zero interest for me with how the game mechanics and legendary items work. If they fully eliminated legendary effects and you had to make a new character, I think it would be a lot more fun. And a lot less one sided.
---
but, the question is, how many of those 38 enemies actually dropped 3* loot?
---
sure, but your post says nuka cola heals rads with the cola nut perk, but the base nuka cola *gives* you rads, hence my confusion...
---
I use .308 as a primaey and sometimes shotgun ammo. If you don't mind, then that'd be great! Trying to hit level 100 but running out of resources is slowing me down quite a bit.
---
Disease Cures, Purified Water, Ammo, Food and Stuff. Necessities for newer players that may not have the resources or the plans yet acquired to attain the items they may need.
---
well that gives me hope then!
---
Add me on psn ill be doing it tonight
---
Enclave and the Brotherhood.
---
I don't really expect them to reply directly, I just hope they see all the feedback and decide to do what's best for the game.
---
I use it all the time and it seems to help. Though it does less as more people are involved as her resistances go up with every new person in the area. 
---
My question is, if I used endangerol when we had 5 people does the effect increase as more people load in (as her resistance increases from player presence does the effect reflect that?), or does it stay at that 5 person level until re-applied, or does it stay at the 5 person resistance entire time. If it doesn't go up as more people show up then it would LOOK like it doesn't do anything. I call for further testing! For SCIENCE!
---
What happened
---
for added fun do the same in the whitesprings bunker, the enclave and Modus are not too happy with the choice.
---
Before mods, the DCG, PF, &amp; MMG, all show the same base damage for me.
---
I'm on XB1, and the Puncturing mod is rare, I have sold a couple before finding a PF I wanted to keep, now looking for another, and I don't know anyone who has learned the Plan.
---
What do you mean
---
Unfortunately I think I got rid of that sword. I beat the questline back when the Stash limit was only 200 pounds so I had no room to save weapons/armor. I wish there was a way to get quest based legendaries again.
---
Meh it takes me on my god tier take no damage while standing still, 450+ damage a shot build a good solid couple minutes to kill one and even then it might kill me once or twice
---
I use my brother's account for that lol. I like levelling and experimenting different kinds of characters so use mine normally. I started the second account to make more trader types ready for when player vending becomes a thing.
---
nice try, OP was not trying to be funny, and it wasn't sarcasm, they really want one star legendaries to drop 3 star items...
---
what the hell are you talking about? did you reply to the wrong person?  and you seem to be talking in absolutes which invalidates anything you might have been trying to say
---
I got kicked off the server
---
That’s not old!
---
Oh weird
---
not that I know of, but they did lower the cost of a bunch of different camp items last patch.. I was maxed out, and then after the patch, had more than 50% left
---
I guess with all the bad loot shes rolling people are tired of fighting her and just shots her once to participate.
---
Several good suggestions.  Even though I’m lvl 150+ there are still a lot of things I’m learning about survival mode as I play 80/20 adventure/survival. 
---
One thing in particular that’s worth mentioning is that grenades and mines can be extremely useful and valuable in survival.  While I rarely use them in adventure, I’ve killed a number of players in survival with both.   Mines are good for entrances and exits and they also let you know who’s near.  They can also take down PA players quickly without you having to attack or give away your position. 
---
Nuka grenades are just devastating overall regardless of your build, and people are surprised at MIRV grenades and the damage circle. 
---
I have stealth boy and speed demon and marsupial and while I agree on PA being a bit noisy I still use it because I can carry a lot of mines and grenades.  It also helps with nuke zones.  
---
One thing you didn’t mention was why you would be mic’d up in survival I have no idea.  Talk about giving away your position.
---
PA *is* the tank.
---
Thanx but I think generally it’s old for gaming
---
As a lower level, wandering the map, not knowing what white springs was, I stumbled upon the golf course thinking what was this oasis... until I started getting attacked by level 68 ghouls. I ran to where I could get up out out reach and did what I could to survive. Eventually I got the hell out of there. Now as a level 126 I go there when I’m bored and need crap to sell.
---
This guy nails it.  Survivor is what survivor is.  Either you play/adapt or lose.  Because your build doesn't work doesn't mean survival is broke.  Is it perfect, no it's far from it.  Does it need tweaks, yes, but it is just 2 weeks old.  The only immediate change I'd like to see are seasons that require you to completely start over.  That alone would even the playing field but until that happens you either adapt or stay in Adventure.
---
I heard someone mention this before and really like the idea. Remove legendaries, limit mutations to one. Focus on more on crafting or survival
---
I don't like the seasons thing. I want to be able to use my character in Survival when I want to. They should give rewards to people who make new chars, but not force everyone.
---
fine, then do away with it, I already lose my junk and a *large* portion of my aid, I shouldn't be penalized for dying in PvP...  especially when it's level dependent, a level 300 is no stronger than a level 50 but they lose 6 times as many caps, fucking ridiculous!
---
can i crash on your couch?
---
If you are on PC I would love to give you a decent price for them XD
---
Its clearing it out as it will be put to use in a future update. This was mention in a previous updates that based may be removed for this. It also give you a free base camp move.
---
I ran like a sissy. Not even slightly shamed.
---
I would really like If the Damage would be normalized for PvP. No more oneshots for Nobody! I want drawn out Battle that may even take up to 10 Minutes Between Players. Thats the fights I wanna see. These one shots are absurd in terms of balance and Tanks should have a Place in this Mode aswell. I want to wear Power Armor and I want to last in it atleast some time. At this Moment Power Armor has *NO* Place in this Mode. You'll die anyway in one hit and you dont have any damage restisting % like legendary armor.
---
you ini files migth have been readonly
---
This is a good way of starting my morning, thank you
---
It must be a hoot being able to one shot any enemy. It sounds so challenging and rewarding!
---
I don't care where you come across a deathclaw in this game, unless you are a low level they just aren't scary...  even at a low level, I killed the one at deathclaw island at level 10 with a level 5 baseball bat...
---
I agree strongly. We need multiplayer mini games for the unusable things we already have in game!
---
But then you see a swarm of angry Col Gutsey and that Ka-chunk sound of their super effective anit0armor rounds!
---
Leather armor might be ultra tanky, X01 might not. This is all how various effects work together, not how much DR it has. I am not aware of DR values for any of my many characters because they mean very little outside of PvE.  
---
You think you understand how to win, yet you enter stations without scouting the area first, and you go in blindly.  
---
The bloodied combination is not the only viable one. Its the only CHEAP one that does not require very specific items. It's still one of the strongest possible combinations if done right, but not the only one.  
---
Melee is mostly useless against opponents who play it good so the fact you specified it further reinforces my judgement. It is only viable when exploiting the event mechanics, and I believe you had a chance to see the results of having combined "no PvP" and "open PvP" areas nearby - people glitch the shit out of it for unfair advantages. The guys you meet at the violent night were lamers, not PvPers.  
---
The thing is, as with any environment, things must stabilise before you can judge them. Right now the game is in a position where people who joined it six months ago with PvP in mind have had a chance to express their tactical and knowledge superiority against their enemies for only two weeks. It will be a bloodbath some more time, but it will also start settling, it already started.  
---
I seen a guy on reddit saying he want's to go to survival for challenges and not PvP, and wants to know what to do not to get wasted. I gave him information on how not to play it stupid. On sunday he wrote that he had the best XP farming spree ever and it was a blast. He first gathered information and then played it smart. You, as you said, gone in blindly - you should not expect any other outcome, ever, especially not from a game where tactical map control means everything, but also simultaneously just as much as your build and gear does.
---
I did this for a while.. however I was meeting up there with a friend to trade some junk the other day, and I realized that these Overseer's caches contain separate loot per player....  can anyone confirm if you put something in it, it will show for someone else..?   -- I'm super afraid it doesn't..  since then I've just been dropping paper bags on top of it.
---
That's a huge camp. That's not a camp anymore, it's a Walmart.
---
Lol, not even an option in many locations.
---
I don’t really role-play, but I definitely have themed sets. I’ve got a camo T-45 set with an auto combat rifle and a ripper for my main, when I want to pretend I’m a soldier. My actual Rifles alt (my main is HW...) has a few different sets- several different pipe-rifles, with a black cowboy hat and the Surveyor’s outfit, for when I’m playing wasteland scavenger. Nuka-girl outfit with Fashionable Glasses, with a Tricentennial laser rifle, Enclave Plasma Sniper, and Alien Blaster sidearm, for when I’m playing 50’s Space Chick. Enclave Officer outfit with Recon Sniper rifle, Silenced 10mm pistol, and 10mm SMG, for when I’m playing Enclave Assassin.
---
Handmade semi-auto, full Forest scout outfit, and combat knife, for when I’m playing woodland scout.
---
so do the assualtrons!
---
It’s not the damage resistance that stops my damage it’s my legendary armour
---
Sorry being a bit thick. Ranged Weapons
---
Legendary Anti-Armour Prefix Ignores 50% of the Armour as expected.
---
Tank Killer DOES work, but the numbers are unknown
---
The three Magazine choices do not work
---
Remind me, What is Stabilized? The Arm Armour Mod?
---
A lot of griefers don’t like survival because they don’t adapt and the crap that works for them in adventure doesn’t work in survival.  There’s also very little risk in adventure.  You screw with someone in survival and they will one shot you and take your caps and loot.
---
What platform you on I’d be interested in helping you out
---
I've had it happen at Watoga Station, Flatwoods, Whitespring, Whitespring Bunker, etc.
---
It all depends on when the game lets you control your character, when you actually move your character, and when the game actually finishes loading the area.
---
In Whitespring, the place it happens most often, if you do not move until all the robots appear around you and are moving themselves, it tends not to happen.  This can take a minute or two at times.  Sometimes worse/longer than others.
---
Whitespring and Bunker seem to be the most often offenders.
---
I think it’s trending older because the gamers that cut their teeth on the Atari and NES are still playing. But in general yeah, you aren’t wrong. There have been a few posts on this subreddit asking about age where a bunch of post-40 people showed up, some in their 60s.
---
Was on a ps4 my friend, appreciate the offer
---
Fully agree, what is the point in having all this stuff in the world to collect only to then hide it away in your stash box, would make your camp look a hell of a lot better with the ability to have mannequins for all the outfits and place to put your PA on display.
---
Damn man I’m Xbox
---
I always have so much stuff and love helping lower level players we definitely need a better way to communicate
---
I’m not lvl 50 and broke as fuck, but I’ll take it!
---
Stablized is while in power armour heavy weapons gain a 15% increase in accuracy and armor piercing up to 45% at rank 3.
---
Make some soap
---
Try to minimize the number of lights (any kind) and turrets you have. They take up alot of space.
---
I dropped a supply drop apparently at the same time as someone else, and I we t to the wrong one. It doesn't help that half the time when I open them they say "steal" anyway, so I didn't even notice. Dude killed me while I was trading, took my junk items and everything.
---
just log out if you are getting attacked?
---
Appreciate the offer though!
---
You had me at sheepsquatch assultron head
---
Well, you can use your main to build decorations in the second account’s base, anyway. Or is that not doable with atom shop decorations? I have barely bought any; most of my atoms have gone to outfits and PA skins, CAMP building isn’t a big thing for me.
---
Share wifi from your phone. Download internet.rar. Install software Internet throttle controller. There are ways.
---
Also if you mean not possible i ingame locations Im yet to meet suvh place and I killed three such leaders so far.
---
I have only done uraniam fever three times, each time with max one other player and luckily each time we could "share"
---
Don’t need it just wanted to say you should probably add your platform! 🙂
---
yeah i was running the teapot event with my level 160 a level 30 was there as well i tried dropping off a nice baggy of booze and cranberry relish but i think they ran off confused.
---
i had it on the picnic table and everything!
---
Awesome
---
On the subject of Armour Mods, does Weighted not grant an Armour piercing effect?
---
Honestly, thank you to everyone whose been helping me out in the game and everyone I've met has been so nice
---
actual mvp
---
Huh. I’ll have to investigate base damage. I was going off the wiki, I’ve never sat down and compared unmodded level 50 versions of all 3. But base damage is less relevant than modded damage anyway! Good luck finding a Puncturing mod!
---
"Some toxic teen" i'm 28 and play the game how it's supposed to be played, without any of the pathetic restrictions.
---
"People not friendly" yeah mate, it's called SURVIVAL. SURVIVE.
---
In short: Wah wah PvP i'm bad wah wah.
---
&gt; a level 300 is no stronger than a level 50 but they lose 6 times as many caps, fucking ridiculous!
---
Not Entirely accurate, but the point is valid. An upper Limit should be in play.
---
make sentinel not work while shooting a weapon similar to the invulnerability spawn timer.
---
Well at the momenti need it for my level 30 sniper on xbox
---
Nuka *Grape* heals rads. I never said the base Nuka Colas heal rads.
---
Yeah i agree the mines are absolutely intense when used in survival around doors.
---
I use them as traps when I'm inside whitesprings station.
---
Yeah i agree on the mics. Not really that useful at the moment in survival unless on an event

Lead is in all childrens toys... little cars, trucks, wooden blocks with letters on them, little alien, etc. It's in paint cans... the cans with paint and the just plain can of paint. Empty paint cans (the ones whose lids are open) do not have lead. Lead is in pencils. Lead is in tin and aluminum cans. Also, makeshift batteries (they look like car batteries). And, of course, the lead pipe. Which is also a weapon and you have to break it down from the weapons menu.
---
haha sure!
---
Oh, you want nerfs? Enjoy wasting your entire inventory in kill, PvE or PvP included.
---
Spec better, more endurance. More mitigation perks. Better armour modding.
---
Faction quests specifically? And not being flippant but "etc." is very vague. Did you do the the non-faction quests in the Toxic Valley? Did you build the Excavator armor?
---
Ive just seen a few mods on vendors for the first time and been playing since release. Both times i saw on my mid teen lvl alt at the train station by the top of the world
---
XD
---
Yup. Between game-breaking lag, idle players, and/or no-damage bugs for the queen, the SBQ is rarely fun. I've beaten her plenty of times, and it's not even fun when you win. The queen really need to be debugged and reworked.
---
No
---
i just hope when they finally make our camps protected in passive mode  that will include our pets
---
how so?  their weapons and armor are all the same?  the amount of perk cards are the same?  what's the difference except time?  sure they could be a more experienced but I can tell you that just doing something more than someone else doesn't always mean you are better at it than them...
---
I port to the vault from time to time and drop a bag in view of the new spawns coming out of the vault. Plans/Recipies, low level gear.
---
We need mini games to go with that. Working pool tables, dart boards, or a mechanical brahmin would go a long way towards making CAMP life more fun.
---
5% per cha for quest Xp? Huh, that sort of explains why my Unyielding Sniper alt has damn near caught up to my PA main in levels. He’s got 3-8 charisma depending on grouped or not, she’s got like 20something, and she does a lot of events.
---
Okay.
---
&gt;These thing wont pass passive electricity but there is one thing that can do it. This will also glow. Sorry for not knowing the correct names of these things.
---
"passive radiator"

I previously had a camp at Whitesprings to level up fast and easy. I was very proud of it, looked really cool. I were about lvl 15. Then a 50 lvl guy appeared to my camp and greeted me and stuff like that. He was using my workbenches and such and looked at my camp for a while. Before leaving he left me some legendary weapons that he was aparrently farming and some radaways bc he saw that i was in need of them. Super nice encounter. These players need rewards fr
---
I don't think it's a good mechanic, but it's been like that for a long time. It would help if there were an additional warning when you're "stealing".
---
I hope for three modes. Two just as it is now and also survival seasonal. The reason for that is I'm mostly interested in fighting with the big guys that have their builds perfect and their gear wondrous. If they release survival seasonal as 3rd mode, I will be having my gang activities on survival, and my lone wanderer activities on survival seasonal. If they make survival seasonal only, no jumping to adventure when wanting to trade etc, then I'll move all my gang activities to seasonal servers, making it more of a clusterfuck for casuals. I suppose many of the big guys who worked for their toons last half year would do the same. We're not going back to the world of slap damage.
---
I'd love to have some more Roleplay oriented survival servers and I only see potential for their existence if survival and survival seasonal will be two different playmodes. One for faction PvP and one for the fresh out the vault holy shit experience.
---
ah, I see, well to make this even *remotely* viable as a replacement to stims and radaway they would have to be nearly as prevalent as stims and radaway, and they aren't, I'll stick to Aquaboy and Traveling Pharmacy...
---
To clarify, she hadn’t played on a console before I met her, so she has almost zero skills with games that use left stick to move and right stick to simultaneously look around.
---
I've thought about having a "free loot" table as well, but I just don't get enough visitors right now to warrant it.  Maybe when player vending happens!
---
Just to clarify I don’t want any money or anything like that. But if you have a good gun or melee weapon I’ll swap it for that.
---
Only problem i ever had was my creature aggroing a non hostile scorchbeast. Never had a problem with that sb until i had a sloth then it would aggro even though the sb was neutral [yellow health bar] and he proceeded to destroy my generator abour four times before i moved
---
Plans, most of it is for CAMP items but they're light and don't take up much Stash space. Haven't fully invested into the vendor idea yet because my fear it will have some form of limitation or hiccup to it.
---
They wanted us all to be the NPCs yet they implemented minimal tools for this to happen. Yes mics and a trade menu, but that all occurs after finding someone. I would like to not have to use a 3rd party app of program to reach potential "customers".
---
Part of my theory is that their design oversight was due to them all being in the same office, seeing each other on the regular basis (water cooler chat) and getting to know each other so being able to trade and have this in-game commerce that they spoke of was easy for them during the development stages, but plop it down in real life and we're all spread out and not nearly as connected.
---
Sorry, I ventured down rant lane. End of rant.

"Better Armour modding" - Getting 1 Shot by a Dude with a Broken Gun.
---
Nah I wont feed the Troll.
---
The Game is in a State where people throw away shit because it justs fills there Inventory. We need things to drain our Inventorys so we can fill them back up to battle again so that this Gameplay Loop feels right again. Right now Im throwing away stimpacks and super stimpacks because I dont need them anymore!?
---
It used to be that you had to be within a narrow range of levels to acquire the plan.  That's not the case anymore.  So, there's no rush to make these Caps, if that's what your concern is.
---
Only a real psycopath would think like that
---
An UN-assisted lvl 50 will very little in the way of level appropriate multi-starred legendarys. Where as a Lvl 300 would of had 250 lvls of collecting and farming for those said items
---
I understand all of your points on “mostly legitimate players harmed”, that includes myself. I have spent hundreds of hours grinding for gear, and still have a mish mash of armor and weapons. No full set of sentinel or unyielding, not one 2 shot explosive. Im not complaining, i have some good gear, and not having perfect gear is what keeps me playing. 
---
However, eventually the item level cap is going to be raised. Its almost a guarantee in a game like this. Especially once player vending and legendary vendors make it easier to get optimal gear. And once there is nothing left to grind for, people stop playing. So developers raise the level cap to real them back in. 
---
Unless of course there is enough content added to make this game less about the loot and more about the questing and events, but at this point the game is pretty loot orientated.
---
Yep, that's all you got from my whole post. I was making a general term about people who enjoy destroying players who can't even come close to your level. If that's you then get triggered by it, maybe when the playing fields are level you might realise why it was such an issue before
---
I believe you mean 190 caps, not atoms, for the plan. And it's there, check carefully.
---
The picture you saw was just a Deathclaw literally retextured as the sheepsquatch, you know that right? Meaning, it looked like a Sheepsquatch but it was legit a Deathclaw.
---
No, once you've learned a plan you should be able to build it from your workshop at any time as long as you have the resources.
---
If you have the red stove plan (bought with Atoms) from the Atomic Shop and the cooking stove plans (bought with caps from in-game vendors) and you have 'learned' the cooking stove plans, then you shouldn't need to buy anything to make them again :)
---
Also renaming items this week. Really hoping that works on power armour frames
---
Try this. 
---
Put a doorway there.
---
Place a connector on the ground outside the room
---
Connect the connector to the generator.
---
select the doorway wall and choose "replace" and change it to a regular wall.
---
The wire will now pass through the wall.
---
Seriously though, the "Advanced Connectors" plan make this stuff easy and neat.
---
Well if course i did, i stopped reading when you automatically assumed anyone better than you at the game is a toxic teen. You lost any respect straight away.
---
Except the prompt doesn't say that, which is a problem.
---
It's not under stoves in the appliances section, it's under the cooking stations in crafting.
---
You bought the skin, not the plan. You still need the basic plan to craft it. Works the exact same way with PA skins--but then you don't need the plans, you just need the armor itself.
---
People seem to like quad I think it’s because of the high dps it has. 
---
For other shotguns bloodied or aae for sure tho
---
kill em with kindness my man :)
---
Whoah. Slow down, breathe.
---
Right. First off, go red enamel cooking stove. Got it in my camp and love it. So much nicer than the rundown oven I had before.
---
You need two things to unlock it: one, you buy it from the atom store with atoms. Secondly, you unlock the cooking stove plans from a vendor with caps (don't forget to read the plan to actually unlock- under notes section in your pipboy).
---
Once unlocked you build it at your camp with resources, steel wood etc. No need to pay any more caps or atoms. It's under cooking/crafting, select the food one, and then move left and right until it comes up as an option.
---
Marvelous. B)
---
Hey if it makes you feel any better just the other day on **this** subreddit someone 'threaten' to rape me because I didn't tell them my build spot, then they got salty after reported them and kept sending me PM's.
---
I say 'threatened' because they "claim" it was all just a joke.
---
Except. I don't find rape to be a joke.
---
Glowing meat cooks into glowing meat steaks which gives you an extra 10 percent melee damage. So I have at least 10 of those on hand and on my favorites wheel when I go in the silo. Also, fury gives melee boost too. I take some of that and eat a glowing meat steak and go to it. Plasma or pulse grenades can help out with mobs of robots especially when they're in a group on the opposite side of the room. 
---
Learn how to bypass the pipe repair part, that saves you some hassle. Also putting your power armor in the doorway when repairing mainframe cores keeps you safe from at least one direction, robots can't get past your power armor chassis. I lay a couple plasma mines down at the other door then fix the mainframe cores.
---
Assaultrons are the hard part, I'll grant you that, but I go for them first and get them out of the way. if you do the silo enough you know where they are and when to expect them. You go in and hit them with everything you got first. 
---
Take some bufftats, grilled radstag and whiskey with you if you wish to farm the lead weights, that'll help you up your carryweight. I can get my carryweight in PA up to 420 or so with one bufftat, a whiskey and a grilled radstag. (not in excavator... I don't use it). I mean there's a whole room of lead in the silo, might as well bring that shit out. 
---
I have a two shot exploding gatling gun I use for the turrets. But you could just turn the turrets against the robots then kill the turrets. 
---
I do the silo so much it's a breeze to me. If you want any more tips HMU
---
it's would have or would've, not would of, and that is not even remotely true, one can spend every level up to 50 grinding caps and spend it all on good legendary gear, the literal only difference past 50 is time...
---
I love whitesprings for this very reason...
---
yeah  consumers should just shut up and let corporations/greedy companies do what they want!  its silly they think they should have their voices heard!   
---
if you couldnt guess, then /s
---
Criticals. Headshots. Vats criticals ignore armour and legendary effects.
---
Headshots (without PA) deal insanely high damage.
---
I literally have gone around on a fresh character levelling and PvP'ing. I've been killing 150+'s without Explosive weapons by just playing smart.
---
Player vending was move to may.
---
You seem VERY confused.
---
You only spend ATOMS in the Atom shop. You spend CAPS in game.
---
ATOMS are only earned via challenges or buying them with real money. CAPS are earned via finding them/earning them through Quests or Events/ Selling items to vendors, just like previous Fallout games.
---
You need the plans ONCE to build an item. Once you know them, you don't need them ever again.
---
Of some breaks your CAMP items, you can repair it in build mode.
---
The thing you purchased in the ATOM shop was effectively a skin for a previously existing item, not the item itself.
---
You didn’t purchase the plans for 190 atoms, they were 190 caps you spent, are you sure it was the right stove plan you bought?
---
Here is a good [link](https://m.imgur.com/a/3ZhkLJl)  explaining what you actually get with each plan.
---
Any idea how big it is?
---
The supermutants have them...granted they are the superior race.
---
Lag could be part of it for those standing still... I've done it about a dozen times now and at least two or three of those times my game would freeze up so bad for 5 to 10 seconds at a time. My connection is fine and so os my PC so hopefully they fix that soon.
---
If you run around PvP clubbing seals with your god tier build I doubt I wanted your respect. Regardless of how fun it may be, if you can't see a problem with destroying people who never had a chance, then I don't know what to tell you
---
Is it still 1999 or are you still on a 56k modem
---
Tried survival yesterday for the first time. Traveled to my camp just as someone had started griefing it. took out my BE gatling and shredded him for the 300 caps and his aid/junk and switched servers. He had destroyed like 1 wall and a few signs
---
Playing Smart.
---
Vats criticals.
---
Because you spec into criticals doesnt make you smart. Its nonsens when people believe less viability is a good thing in PvP.
---
Have fun doing that smart PvP of yours.
---
Yes I'm hoping player vending shakes up a bunch of things. I stumbled across this camp at Whitesprings (not near the golf club, don't worry) so I imagine they get enough foot traffic to justify it.
---
Just give it about a week and it will fix its self thats what it did with me
---
I’ve done actual testing with a basic vs a Zealots sniper rifle. The Zealots absolutely works on scorchbeasts. 
---
I’ve heard the rumors about Hunters; haven’t personally investigated yet but I intend to.
---
They really should stop aggro after they kill you once. Ine time I clipped one on acciedent at a low level and made a grave mistake of walking into the resort. Spent 30 minutes trying to get my loot back. I had just spent the entire hour looting the whole place.
---
I've had the same problem with the cooking stove plan disappearing on 2 different characters.  Once I even had it built in my camp when I noticed I couldn't build another a few days later.  The good news is that once I purchased and learned the plan a second time it stayed for good.
---
Yeah mate, i'm specces into when i've been doing it as a FRESH character. Did you even read? 😂
---
I had one that was going in and out of the load screen door at West Tek. We finally killed him inside, but his body got launched threw the door. Of course his body was never found. Luckily he was a no star legendary. Would have been much more disappointed if he had 3 stars!
---
how much would an aae be worth tho?
---
&gt;The three Magazine choices do not work
---
Well, that's just lovely.
---
&gt; grinding caps and spend it all on good legendary gear,
---
Well, the in game Vendors don't have that gear, so I guess they were assisted by someone selling them the gear whether that be a mule, friend or random.
---
Either way, I am done here.
---
Some people are just toxic individuals hiding behind the mask of anonymity.
---
In the frat house there is a room that is Nuka Cola themed where you can usually find a Nuka Grape.
---
Oh, ouch. Yeah, I really wish we could re-build those if we've completed the quest.
---
Just scrap the stored blueprint and rebuild.  It'll be faster than dealing with the placement issues.
---
It's very difficult at times to get full buildings to set in place.  And you can't really tell what item it is that would be causing it.  You'll spend more time and caps trying to get it to sit down right than you would just scrapping that blueprint, and placing the items by hand.
---
pretty sure dungeons were moved to may 16th
---
I make heavy studded leather chest pieces and hand them out a lvl 10 one has almost as much armor as a full set of random lvl 30 slap asbestos armor on it to stop them from catching on fire and boom saves them 50+ stimpacks easy over the lifetime of the armor
---
Yeah, that would be bad for its tummy :/
---
Been there this entire time.
---
yes you are all correct... atoms and caps .... just a little frustrated.
---
The game is awesome, don't get me wrong.  It was the frustration of getting it, and then LOSING it, and then not having it and thinking I had to GET IT AGAIN.
---
Thank you all for the quick postings! I'll go make sure I have the scrap I need and look under the " cooking stations " in Crafting. That's where I made the error, I believe.
---
Thank you all again!
---
If no one has called for it:
---
Ammo .38 and .44
---
Chems: Buff Tats, Fury, Grape Mentats, Med-x, Psychobuff and X-cell
---
I would probably say just grind, regardless. Once you've got to level 30 you will inevitably have another weapon that you'd like to work towards. Just keep the sniper in your stash and keep grinding away. 
---
Hopefully you'll find someone to join you, as I'm on PS4. Which sniper is it?
---
It’s kinda the most epic weapon I’ve ever had, so sorry, but no. I think I have another machine gun with random legendaries, though. I’ll have to check.
---
Everytime i did Uranium Fever, every high level player would wait until i hit. Not even once i encountered a douche in events, at least it says they are the minority.
---
Well, melee has powered armor and sledgehammers with rocket engines fixed to the back of them.  On a straight kinetic impact getting hit by a supersledge should be way more of a death sentence than getting hit by a few small caliber bullets.
---
It’s all yours. I’m also on EST, so I’ll see you tonight! GT: LukewarmLoveGel
---
Its a night vision hunting rifle with a muzzle brake
---
Had the same thing.  Loaded up with 10+ legendaries after a run.  Sadly nothing of value but it was a pleasant surprise nonetheless.
---
Lol you can control the internet in so many ways, I just gave you the most average one that can do the trick.
---
dude, how is using the various online markets, and spending hard earned caps, getting assistance from someone?  I could see if that person gave them the gear, but spending caps is totally legitimate, and either way, being level 250 doesn't guarantee good gear, say they had a luck of 1 for some reason and are only rocking one star legendaries?  dude, time is the only factor, get over it...
---
The textures fit that model pretty perfectly 
---
I'd give it an 80% chance of it being a deathclaw with a different texture.
---
I'm hoping it goes with good with salt as I'm a crafter / pack mule build and even with good with salt I find 40-50 spoiled items in my backpack every day and thats a lot of caps I could have spent on new plans
---
also speed demon is great with herbivore you can just pick random plants as you run and snack em with no disease chance
---
There's a very clear photo in Morgantown High, does anyone know if that is meant to represent any of the factions?
---
I just assumed it was some dev's messing about popping a pic of themselves into the game, easter egg fashion.
---
I build and scrap in sets of 10, duper perk adds maybe 2 for a total of 12 at a time. I have max gunsmith w/ scrapper. If it matters my int is probably 13 or 14 and luck is 11. I don't expect a mod every 10-12, but I get pissed off if I don't learn a mod in 20-24 scraps. This POS gun eats a lot of screws.
---
Wow, you're the boss dude. Rock on Tommy
---
I believe the enclave vendor and the Watoga vendor sell the plan for the advanced power conduit set.
---
This plan is a must have for clean looking power.
---
I have a level 50 furious combat rifle want that?
---
Combat shotgun I’ve bought 2 one for 7k one for 12k. I’ve seen them go as high as 20k a month ago
---
Pump isn’t worth a lot cause it’s dps is much lower but for pve it works fine probably 5-7k is a fair price for pump
---
I like the herbivore mutation I can just eat any random plant I walk by with no disease also meat is far more valuable since its normally 2x or more of the value of plants to vendors
---
Also are you on xbox
---
What about the ones you accuse of cheating and ban
---
Yes! THey were there in Fo 4! It shouldn't be so hard to add them to Fo76
---
This seems like a good idea, but I've played games with the whole shared bank/stash thing and newcomers joining just to loot the bank and leave would probably be a huge problem, any idea how that wouldn't be the case for this shared stash? 
---
It would honestly be a nice addition to the game but it also just seems like more problems that would be added that would maybe cause a fuss if not done correctly.
---
I would recommend locations that have junk piles or resource deposits. It's a great way to have a steady flow of particular resources that you may need.
---
Next time Kite the adds inside for any hiders,... if only I could figure out how to get people off the buildings that are taking aggro and consequently causing her to not land... pet peeves, I don’t mind low players if they are trying ,..
---
Overall the FO76 community is like this, very nice and helpful. Agreed that the douche’s are the minority, but it also feels like it’s becoming more common.
---
I alternate between an undercover Enclave agent who’s embedded himself in the Mothman cult to determine how much of a threat they/the Mothman are to continued Enclave operations in Appalachia, and a Mothman cult member who’s a merchant gone slightly crazy from continued isolation as he’s managed to outlast the rest of the cult/the Scorched.
---
That would be nice!  Especially for those who wish to sell PA
---
&gt;As for bikes, I’d love it. But, I don’t think the engine could handle it. The map is extremely NOT flat, and you’d get caught on everything. It’s not like Skyrim, where you can justify a horse being janky in movement. I wish they could have them, though.
---
Sounds like the solution to this is have a third tier of animal friend that lets you tame and ride radstags.
---
Mate, i'm level 40 killing 100+ on a fresh character using a none legendary lvl 25 gun. Check my profile on xbox, look at my game clips - idezarc. I even took a screenshot of my weapon for fuck sake.
---
nah man it was made by the enclave right after the war
---
You can find the mods at different vendors, but they are rare.  To date, I've found Dense mods for Leather, Metal, Robot, Marine and Combat.  Of these, I've only found Marine and Robot more than once.  The others are stupidly rare.  I don't believe any of them can still be acquired through scrapping, as one of those mods that Bethesda arbitrarily decided can't be learned that way.
---
I mean, obviously, Dense is useful against Scorchbeasts and PvP players with explosive weapons, but Fireproof does much the same thing (and in Power Armor, for that matter).  There's no reason why it should be this rare, but then that's just me hating on the whole arbitrary "You can't learn this mod" system.
---
I found a 3 star Hermit Crab, which was the first and only time I ever seen one with any stars.  But it just dropped it's typical loot pool without any legendary items. Makes me feel like those were never intended to be legendaries....
---
Sounds like they are slowly turning white springs into a social area
---
Why aren’t there riot shields in armories and police depots?
---
&gt; You got one sentinel and two cavaliers out of all that farming. 
---
Where? I can't find any in the spreadsheet
---
It’s sad... like most of us don’t already have 10k plus or even more... you have to be a really desperate human to chase 3 caps across an entire map...
---
 Maybe we could put together a group, look for people who really want to kill her. 6 releases during the weekend, 2 have been ruined by people who do nothing or low levels that get in the way. my id is shutten232 if you want at some point to launch some missile in prime
---
great thread and thank you to all involved; awesome information for us Adventure players who are thinking of trying out Survival.
---
It has to be well thought out. For me, every new comer is in discord with the whole clan, but of course that is not always the case. It would be cool to have different ranks for members, so that low levels are only allowed to see food, water, basic ammo, apparel etc, not having access to the rare ultracite ammo, rare fluxes and weapons over their level.
---
I mean I do it as a mercy kill and leave their junk. I’d rather kill them and get their 10 caps and leave them their junk than someone else doing it and taking their junk.
---
Yea. I have. I make sure to clear Bubbles out of her stock of the rarer flavors and always pick up Nuka Cola whenever I come across some. Since day 1 of BETA so now I'm a Nuka hoarder. I could probably open up my own Soda Fountain at this point...
---
Before you move your camp (if you haven't already), log in again and check that you get the message multiple times. Some people reported getting the message and having it go away on a subsequent login.
---
Honestly i don't see that happening, the whole Deathclaw thing only became a thing after the "leak". No one actually knows how this thing will actually perform yet. And just because it fits the model doesn't mean it's 100% going to be that thing. He could have honestly just as easily used a gulper to show it and people would call it a Gulper reskin.
---
I remember the first weeks of the game  the reddit was chaos 
---
The current survival mode was classified as a "Beta" so it's possible they can make significant changes like that. I don't know to what degree they'll change it, but for testing purposes / getting feedback they can even introduce all kinds of wild temporary changes and settings if they really wanted to.
---
cheers   ,did think, that little shack thingy, just off the tracks, has always been [there. How](https://there.how)  could I not notice the smoke ??????
---
I've honesty had a lot of friendliness in Survival.  I've made more friends in Survival than I ever did in Adventure.
---
Of course, it helps to have a mic.  Also helps when you get the drop on them and sternly ask if they are going to be cool while your are chameleoned.

---
\- I haven't been in a survival game yet when a nuke was launched, can you still see where it's going to land or is that only known to the launcher?
---
\- If I'm at my camp and someone is trying to kill me can I fast travel or while it not let me travel as it would if an AI enemy was there?
---
\-  Usually when I'm in survival I can't actually see 1st-3rd longest life, sometimes none, 1, 2 but never all 3, is this a glitch or intended?
---
Like everyone else pointed out, its purely subjective.
---
I'm a ps4 user and I love dropping off gear and extra plans at overseers, I'm a little skittish about actually talking with people so I stay off the mic and haven't really offered to build anyone anything outside of some irl friends.
---
But I love stalking true low levels and sending them a gift bag of supplies or a gift bullet of help when they need it.
---
I think it makes sense to release them with the new dungeon since that is where they would primarily be used.
---
The magazine mods not working must be a new bug or something, I tested both a hunting rifle and a 10mm pistol a few months ago and the magazines were absolutely affecting damage (I think I was testing actual damage done vs another player, not checking what Awareness said; it may be that Awareness doesn’t show the effect but it actually works)
---
Shear Terror is the name of the new DLC coming today
---
Hello,could be the sign.
---
I had that problem a few times and I think the problem is in the things hanged in the walls.
---
Not sure but i think it could be the problem.
---
+karma much appreciated!!
---
Good dam. That is a very low learn rate.
---
at least in this sub, it has a definite family feel for me; a little nuts, very emotional at times, quick to anger but quick to support as well.
---
people seem to actually care, and generally the sub is entertaining as hell to read :)
---
There’s an item in game made for this.
---
Seems like a good idea, that or give the newcomers a timer until they're able to access it i.e 7 days.
---
Where on the Internet were people asking for repair kits? Cause I’m a thorough internet lurker and I don’t recall seeing one request for that anywhere.
---
Civics Center usually has a legendary scorched at the top
---
Anyone with a decent vats build or just uno decent build in general wil 1 hit

Lol no, it's because it's a video game where you can do things you wouldn't be able to do in real life.
---
Just because it's set in a post apocalypse doesn't mean you'd much rather prefer that in real life. In real life you wouldn't be walking around with a huge gun killing everything and being a hero.
---
You'd be dead.
---
If you kill them too fast, i.e. they just started their moving animation, they will glitch and sometimes drop nothing. But no it doesn’t matter whether you let them regen or not. I tested this specifically over several days. Whether regen or not has nothing to do with their loot. Some one-shot killed dropped three stars and many regened dropped one star or even drill and syringer. It’s completely RNG.

no, limiting free speech is not the way to go

if you dont like the threads, dont read them, it doesnt affect you in any way other than you will have to scroll more with your mouse

i kinda feel this thread itself is just bait for Karma, riding the coattails of the most recent hot topic
---
If you remove wasteland whisperer do you lose the pet ?
---
Might, but next week is when the new dungeon comes out and the post itself says weeks. I definitely wouldn't be suprised if they come out on May 7th, along with Player Vending/Ever Upwards
---
Point number 3 wouldn’t work because of your 2nd bullet. 99% of people wouldn’t want to a few hours getting to level 10 just to activate pvp and die to someone or something ridiculous just to start all over again from 0
---
It won't give you any food from it I don't think
---
To be most accurate, I would prefer them to use other avenues to fund development of future content, such as paid DLC or a subscription.  However, if their modelling suggests the best route is putting non-cosmetic items in the atomic shop, so be it.  I’ll make the choice for myself as to if I pick any up, do without or stop playing the game.
---
I was literally thinking the same thing. It used to be a nightmare in here.
---
Works well for glitched camps doesn't work against environmental usage genius aka people in caves and tunnels
---
It does.
---
Yes, it just doesn't satisfy hunger. You still get the bonus effects, though. Like SPECIAL buffs, AP and HP regen, carry weight, etc. So it basically turns it into cotton candy: tastes good but you're still hungry.
---
wont be on until late 'gmt', but I might take the hand made of your hands if price is right
---
Tough question, hopefully someone reads this who has found a safe way to go about doing this, definitely a high risk strategy as all it would take is a server disconnect and they would be lost if you couldn’t rejoin on a friend. If your going to try it my only advice would be to drop a bullet of some kind to ensure the paper bag appears then transfer the tech data in and take 1 at a time, there may be a max quantity per 24 hours you can submit but I’ve done 3 in 1 day before so I can vouch for that number, then if you see someone’s launching a nuke on fissure prime and scorched earth is going to happen pick up your tech data quick in case it causes a disconnect, good luck with it, oh and the place you turn it in is in a basement at camp venture and not very high traffic so usually it just other folk turning in data down there so if you could get your paper bag to drop in the ammo room behind the door that’s right next to the drop off point it may not be so noticeable, there’s a keg behind that door that’s a similar colour to a paper bag, anyway just a thought 🤔
---
wow, so if im understanding, then ranged weapons with anti armor are wasted? damn...
---
... autistic comm these days from lot of game companies. but they forget we are not.fools.
---
same here about the time zone, do you have anything interesting to trade?
---
There's a patch coming in like 8 minutes, so you won't be able to play for a few hours. ;)
---
Hey, nothing wrong with a shower beer! Take them all the time
---
I have no numbers but i can definitely feel and see the difference between a lever action rifle with no perforating mag and a hunting rifle with a perforating mag.
---
but people have completed it (i'm sadly not one of them) though the challenge is marked as complete.
---
But it replenished my food?
---
Has pacifist camp damage been fixed?, my friend had their camp destroyed by some high level jackasses that they didn't fight but were able to wreck their camp.
---
My pleasure!
---
Not at all trying to be rude but that's not worth power leveling for. The muzzle brake improves the recoil but you lose range. Night vision is okay, but not a very rare mod. Ask here (nicely) or at the filthy casuals sub to see if someone can make you something better for level 20. Hell, I just made a level 5 with a hardened receiver, perforating magazine, medium scope and suppressor and threw it in the overseers stash in flatwoods, just for kicks (and to free up a tiny bit of space in my stash). Hopefully, some level 5 found it and is enjoying it.
---
Bethesda said the atomic shop would be cosmetic only, at a time when they thought the game would be a huge seller.  That fell short, so now they’re scrambling to cover their financial asses.
---
I have no issues with these kits being implemented, especially for adventure mode it’ll be great for upcoming raids, dungeons, silo runs . I get why some feel it as pay to win so hopefully it’s not useable in survival mode where that’s the only place it holds an advantage over another player I feel
---
Sorry I should have said -I’m on PS4!!
---
yeah i noticed this in regular adventure mode, many times my first melee hit sounds like it connected, but does no damage
---
very annoying and can get you killed
---
Since survival launched without requiring new characters I can't tell you anything about that mode - I'll never play that broken game mode because Bethesda was too deaf to listen to community input.
---
All you PvP peeps that think you're something cause you got all that gear in easy mode and then go play survival - continue stroking your fragile egos.  This game has no hardcore PvP - most players I suspect will likely not survive even a minute of action in PUBG.
---
&gt;Seriously guys, am I missing something here
---
Yeah, the mute button.
---
Could I get that two-shot shotgun? My gamer tag is ReferableSumo27 (same as my username). I can be on in like 10 minutes or whenever works for you.
---
OMG I need to do this ppl always try to get me to fight them WS I will take their loot bag too
---
All yours! I’ll hop on now, and you join whenever you’d like. No rush!
---
ahaha Follen is the past of Follar in spanish that means acually F\*\* off/ F\*\*\*ing XD
---
Yeah its funny cause ive put so much time in deciding which magazine to go with...perforating or stinging ect...i can never tell if ones any better than the other. Or if its worth taking the smaller ammo capicity for
---
I just hit it with a hammer and it stands there crying about it’s knee that i shattered.
---
Sounds like they were trying to pick a fight with anyone they could. Sadly you just happened to be there. I don't see anything wrong with your username at all. Not to say other people see it the same way.
---
I would rather have a fairer Survival Mode, with no legendary mods and more balanced. It shouldn't matter if you are shooting with a level 1 or 50 gun with the same stock mods. There can be a harder Survival Mode, where these things matters.  
---
Dying and losing that char doesn't sound that fun. Maybe a challange mode. You must use a new char but you doesn't start like normal and you get some Levels and sutff for free. You get either a timelimit or a level limit, where pvp isn't active, so you can sort your stuff and so on and go to a good position on the map. When you die, you loose your char but you can keep collected stuff (minus what you got at the beginning) and get rewards, based on how well you did.
---
Then why exactly did you think I was addressing you in my post. You just said you don't use legendaries and you don't seal club, my insult was directed towards  level 200 plus bloodied builds that kill for fun.
---
That's the Enclave Armor from Fallout 2. It was based on the prewar X01 prototype.
---
Dont worry mines suck your feet i get the weird looks to
---
be careful with crickets
---
Yes there are lol enemies cap out at 92? I believe right now. The awol event is 50 and 62
---
Nuclear winter! Lol
---
It says you need the cooking stove plan in the “aromic” shop ;)
---
Savage
---
Because i still go around killing people for the sake off it. I play Survival to hunt people which is also one of your problems.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Underneath it.  I believe it also removed the Enclave underarmor that was already equipped but I would have to recheck to verify.  I tried a couple other outfits like the jeans/flannel combo and they were also removed when the Bomber jacket was equipped.  Not a great design or look which is unfortunate.
---
yep
---
Guess I’m jumping in green pools today?!  Didn’t know they held chests!
---
Yeah I think you were the guy I referenced haha
---
Yup just checked you were lol
---
Just have fun, and probably stay away from survival mode.
---
yesss
---
Well the ranged mods have no effect at least in awareness. Other are saying they it may be a visual glitch and actually working
---
I've heard that the Endangerol barrel doesn't actually work at all.  Are you sure it's not just a placebo effect?
---
Haha that's actually my surname! I feel proud today
---
I don't get why they say pay to win honestly :/ It's repairing at 100% sure, but you can repair it at 200% with a bonus at the nearest workshop and it doesn't cost a lot, and with the right perk you don't need to repair anything in multiple days :/ (I get that they're angry because of 'we wont sell utility item' but for pay to win... eh
---
not much I want rid of   1 single shot l50 black powder. 1 2shot l15 black powder and bought a vampire dragon last night,just because i could,and it was suprisingly cheap
---
That would be pretty trippy just walking along and you hear a voice speaking to you, hiding in active camo
---
I agree that the change they made  essentially ruined it for PvP (even though I don't PvP, it's pretty clear from the info), but your pleas to have it fixed in patch 8 are a little late as patch 8 is dropping with the server maintenance an hour after your post.
---
So glad they changed it to this, its annoying when ypu dont remember which vendors youve already visited
---
No it shouldn't. Either you lost the mutation (check your stats) or it's bugged. See if you're still getting the benefits from eating raw meat. That'd be cool if you had the best of both worlds. If so, don't say anything or they'll fix it.
---
Yeah that was part of why were testing.
---
No, I like the pc community, and while there are no e console players, they seem to have much higher levels of toxic players...they can keep them
---
I wish I could either mount or have a life sized statue of one outside my camp
---
You can only share ingame items. I'm only getting CAMP items for the 2nd account though, I get skins etc on main.
---
Ya, it's tied to food decay.  And of course when they added it they screwed up non-alcohol food decays as well.
---
I hope they tune it up and make the whole decay system a bit better today.  Food spoils way to fast ever since Patch 7.  And Booze should be separated from the Fast Travel / server log in decay hits since its decay is not a penalty but a bonus.  I doubt you can actually go out and farm up enough scorchbeasts to get enough meat drops to make mixed meat stew before the first ones you received start to get near spoiling.  I mean, you could get lucky and find enough on 1 or 2 SBs, but I've killed half a dozen and still not had enough pieces to make it all.  Cooked food should last longer too.
---
I visit this location frequently and it always been there.
---
That's pretty low on my list of people that frustrate me. Regardless what does it matter, you dissagree with my opinion.
---
Are you on PC? I'm highly interested in some of these.
---
Not rebuilt it yet, i did reload a few times but get the same.
---
Apparently my surname which I use in my username means "humping, f**king" in Spanish...who knew!
---
Would be nice.  Ever since they added the radios though, it's Appalachia all day every day.
---
That promise was made on Day 1, but things have changed since then.  
---
Let Bethesda slide?  Bethesda needs to hold the guy that made that promise accountable, and fire his ass.  He also promised a financial windfall in FO76 and failed to deliver.  As a result, Bethesda is exploring means of supplemental revenue.
---
Calling it now, The Fixer’s Suit is going to be fresh af.

My character, Kasumi Sabishi, is the daughter of a Japanese-American who was an aspiring medical scientist shortly before the Great War and was able to get into Vault 76. She was born in the Vault, in the year 2082 to be exact, and her mother died at her birth. Her father had to raise Kasumi alone and always tried his best teaching her everything he knew about medicine. In the Vault they were faced with prejudice because of their resemblance to the Chinese. Her father left the Vault five years early as a scout because he “lost a bet“ and I role play that he's still out there somewhere.
---
She uses stealth and sniper techniques and likes to work alone hence the name Kasumi Sabishi (translation: lonely mist (kind of at least:) ). She was attracted to the BOS because she too likes to study technology.
---
Crossplay would be nice to have, but it might be a little wonky against pc players, who can aim better, install clicker macros, and use certain visual mods to remove grass/see players.
---
Takes you 10h to formulate a lazy comeback on a dead post. Stop bothering me.
---
Well when we did testing all 3 mods and unmodded did the exact same damage.
---
Exactly, like why even have the jukebox if it only plays the one song, when the radio plays well, the radio.
---
While I agree with all points made, as someone who has run both sides of the armour battle and all counters of the weapon battle I would also like to say that my assassin Cav AA DCG build requires tons more skill including watching my AP making sure theirs cover and constant work, I do also think that if they nerf armour they’ll nerf both sets (Cav and sent) equally probably to like 10%, which still allows for a insanely high amount of damage reduction (doubtful they’ll nerf) however personally I think the biggest nerf needs to be tank killer’s staggering and crippling, I personally think staggering should be maybe 5% and the crippling maybe a 20% chance, same with the shotgun version but less of a nerf. As I said I’ve done every build and have recently started a Sent assassin pistol Vats crit build, that is incredibly strong but not unbeatable, I’m often killed by smart melee’s and Cav uses, I’ll end up being made to bleed and I’ll end up dying through the bleed, or if a melee is smart they stagger/crit me killing me instantly. All in all I agree with what you’ve said but would suggest that it isn’t melee that needs a buff but rather rifles, specifically tank killer that needs the nerf. I also think both Sentinal and Cav should be dropped to 10% but assassin should also be raised to 10% so it pretty much balances out (it’ll end up reducing it slightly but not enough to cause outrage) if they dropped the Cav/sent threshold any more then any semi decent build could 1 hit everyone
---
I’ve argued the same but a lot feel that saving on cost of materials and time to find the work bench, especially while in a pvp fight it saves their apparel from breaking and continuing the fight.   But no one knows how it works, can it be hot  Keyed?, how long does the repair kit take to repair?, but they just lash out angry over “broken” promises and it won’t stop here they’ll add more non cosmetics to the shop blah blah
---
Are you Todd Howard’s burner account? How many times can one person write a reply like this in one thread?
---
The solution is to update your ini, not disable your mods.
---
What was her user name; FauxOutrage?
---
While I’m here hittingit for 1000 odd damage and I’m not killing? Smh
---
They're also changing it so that all vendors share a common pool of 1400 caps.  So you can do your daily vendor run at a single vendor anyway.
---
Yeah you’ll keep getting the same message. This happens when you move your little green C.A.M.P. node around in your camp. If it’s moved anywhere you couldn’t initially place your camp (in a red no-build zone), you’ll get this error when logging out and back in. Can’t change it now, but keep that in mind on your next camp. Leave that little node in an appropriate spot!
---
Screw the SBQ and scorchbeats in general being difficult I can kill them in a couple shots it’s the bloody deathskull radscorpions that are the problem
---
Tolerant_feminist.
---
This has been the upside to the rough start the game has.  All the haters and toxic players were unhappy and left to other games...leaving only certain types of casual players and hardcore fans.

I am very happy with the community on pc, sure you will always find the occasional douchebag, but 99% great people.

***Bugs and Oversights***
---
* As of 3/13 patch, the Tinker's Workbench and Brewing Station sounds can now be heard from considerable distances, by any nearby player, as if the bench is right next to you
---
* Daily Quest - Ecological Balance - This quest consumes the password, 'Amy's Note', on completion, which then requires you to retrieve the password from Amy's body every time you complete the daily, despite the password never changing and the quest never prompting you to retrieve it
---
* Logging in while wearing the Nuka-Girl Rocketsuit *sometimes* results in the player's left glove + hand [being invisible](https://imgur.com/a/mVN83YJ) (in first person) until the armor is reequipped
---
* Basements allow light and godrays to [pass through their walls/ceilings](https://imgur.com/a/4Oc2ThJ)
---
* Steeped Thistle Tea [cannot be crafted](https://imgur.com/a/t4sAPVW) even if you have all of the ingredients 
---
* Glowing Enemies sometimes incorrectly spawn with ['Scorched' textures rather than 'Glowing' textures](https://imgur.com/a/r0ZC1ck)
---
* If you travel to a location where there is already a dead flying enemy (died before you arrived), their corpse will continue to animate as if they are flying (ex: [Bloodbugs and Mr. Handys](https://imgur.com/a/ipFsTU3))
---
* Aluminum Oil Can incorrectly scraps into Oil and Steel, instead of Oil and Aluminum as the name suggests
---
* Aluminum Tray incorrectly scraps into Steel, instead of Aluminum as the name suggests
---
* When Bee Swarms die, they leave behind small ant bodies (likely because they are repurposed Nuka-World flying ant swarms)
---
* If you charge the Salvaged Assaultron Head any higher than 1 charge, firing it at an enemy will only do 1 charge worth of damage (you will see the health bar go down and then jump back up, this is basically a reproducable version of the "damage bug")
---
* In the team menu, when you relog, every player's icon reverts to the default Vault Boy regardless of the actual icon they are using
---
***Quality of Life Wishlist***
---
* Not sure how possible/feasible it is, but would be cool to see teammate's loadscreens intermixed with your own
---
* Rename 'Scrap Assaultron Head' into 'Junk Assaultron Head', the current name is extremely similar to 'Salvaged Assaultron Head' so it is very easy to get the two confused (especially since they share the same model)
---
* Make the CAMP model of Razorgrain the same as the 'Wild Razorgrain' found at Billings Homestead; it is much smaller and better looking than the current giant square blocks of Razorgrain
---
* Atom Shop - A toggle to display only owned/unowned items
---
***Gameplay/Balance Wishlist***
---
* Toxic Valley needs a unique vendor (and more content/love in general, it's a pretty under-utilized region)
---
* Add Scout Armor to the legendary list
---
* Craftable Beehives for CAMPs so we can harvest honey and be the best beekeepers in the wastes!
---
Maybe they used a Rad X?  That suppresses mutations, right?  Ever since I started using mutations I ditched all my Rad X (had 100s of them).  Instead using Rad Sponge in nuke zones.
---
I’m right at the edge of Harpers Ferry and am very worried for my CAMP, it’s been there for almost 3 months now but when they add the new event to the area I may be Campless
---
Thats awesome!
---
It was definitely 3rdWaveWoman
---
a company flat our backtracking on a promise it made before launch isn't "blah blah blah." I get that it's not important to YOU, but that doesn't mean it isn't important.
---
I got rid of the one in my camp because when the cell loads it turns itself on. I'd love if they could get that sort of stuff to save state when it unloads.
---
Does Bethesda actually go on this sub?
---
GT: Toby Mata, Rad-x Diluted!!
---
I just looked it up and it actually does. Not like you did it on purpose though. Honestly it's a pretty funny understanding.
---
Yeah it does
---
They just need to add actual factions, then they can do social stuff about factions
---
All yours! Servers are going down as we speak, so hit me up after they’re up so I know you’re ready!
---
Where is AWOL? Ive heard it’s great for legendaries, and every time I play I occasionally pull up the map and check all the events popping off but I’ve legit never seen it once. 
---
Also, have people given up on Violent Night? Last couple times I did it nobody else showed up and it’s a bitch to run alone.
---
There is no set price. Sure, there are some rare or unique weapons that command prices in the 5k+ range but those are usually easily identifiable based on the weapon type and popularity, which can be researched by simply scrolling through completed sales. 
---
Items are worth however much people are willing to pay for them based upon their own wants. I really wanted a specific Axe once so I offered to pay 7k to anyone that could produce one. It usually only sold for 3k but I wanted it, no one had it publicly listed, and I had the caps so I offered a much higher price than it was “worth”.
---
It’s all opinions. 
---
Many people just list their items and ask for Cap Offers. These are figures that people are willing to pay so that price is what it’s worth, at least to them. You can then decide if the offer is good enough for you, and respond whether you accept or decline the deal. 
---
I can tell you what I’d pay for those weapons, but it would just be my opinion, which is just as viable as anyone else’s and could vary hugely from previous sales history. 
---
In general, 1* aren’t worth anything. 2** are worth something, depending on major and minors, and 3*** tend to have value, but once again it depends. 
---
Good luck.
---
I've had a few times where I had a sign/poster across two  walls, and the game would get screwy. It's annoying but I make sure no items cross another floor/wall now when I move my camp. It seemed to help alot.
---
LOL, probably because of "Follen"
---
Yeah the fact that nothing to bad has happened has sort of caused the amount no toxic people to resurge
---
The win in P2W does not necessarily mean win in PvP. P2W is defined as getting an advantage in game obtainable only by paying. While soe may argue that repair kits are also available in game, the basic ones can be obtained instantly and as many as you want, anywhere, which is not true for the non-store version. Hence comes the P2W aspect.
---
It’s hardly lazy. You just can’t admit you spouted out some nonsense. Clearly you don’t even know what a bluff is, maybe you should study the dictionary a bit before you go on a site that requires writing and reading comprehension.

No worries! Outside if 3-3:45 EST I’m available pretty much any time
---
I love that people cry about repair kits somehow being “pay to win” but the hundreds/thousands of players selling TSE weapons and OP armor isn’t.
---
Yup, you have the same info I have gathered so far. Keep an eye out for Leather and Metal mods, and plans for all of them. They sell for a buttload of caps. I consulted a well known big-time item trader on this and that's what he told me. :)
---
Not really, they could be thriving in appalachia around the time of FO3,4 and NV. Just like the commonwealth doesnt really know much about the brotherhood or the enclave, and the commonwealth was some "far off" region some people in the capital wasteland knew about.  
---
The Brotherhood expedition sent east knew of the enclave and the NCR on the west coast, but before that no one in boston or the capital wasteland knew there was something left in the west, let alone a serious new nation building (NCR)  
---
Its entirerly possible no one knows what went down in appalachia, all we know for sure is that somehow the scorchbeasts were stopped, or they would have spread across the continent by the time of the later games. It stands to reason to then assume "someone" was left in appalachia to do some rebuilding, they may well have expanded westwards or southwards instead of east, and so havent run into any other areas we have encountered thus far.
---
It only affects the condition of drops
---
Is it the one near the snake on the map?
---
The Whitesprings is completely appropriate and doable for level 28.  I'm not saying you won't die, cause you will. But it's not as bad as all that for a heads up player and should be easier since the pacifist patch. I went there at level 25 and put on 10 levels very quickly. There are plenty of places to get an advantage on the ghouls when they are too high a level to handle and they aren't always lvl. 42 or 68. The robots are a great asset for higher level enemies as you can aggro them and kite them over to the robots and let them finish the job.  Downside is all the nuke strikes, but there are are benefits to those too if you have a hazmat suit and can team up or hang around friendly higher level players.  I am lvl 199 and have no problem sharing my kills with lower levels and there are alot more players who are friendly these days since the pacifist update.  If you decide to go there and set up, I suggest a Southwest approach and build your camp in the hills above the resort.  I set up on the greens South of the resort, but there wasn't as much nuking going on back then.
---
Cost of material ? Repairing weapon is really cheep and with white knight, armor is  easy to repair too and have longer durability ! (Same with weapons they can have a durability perk)
---
 (ok for the armor i admit it's not really easy to find ballistic fiber if you don't know where to search)
---
 And we'll get the 'super' repair kit by doing event etc and by what bethesda had said only the basic one (I think) are to sell so, personally i'd say it's just an emergency item if you didn't repair (but why wouldn't you repair before going killing things ?)
---
True! Guess she was having one of those days ;)
---
never too late man ! ahaha
---
Here's one: when do we get patch notes?
---
sick if the servers aren't back up my 12est i'll be on sometime after 9
---
I know this isn’t likely going to be read by anybody but I’m going to post it anyway. Bethesda: If you are struggling with revenue generation from the atom store, it’s likely because many people like me, have 3000 atoms saved up from gameplay but nothing in the store is appealing. The cosmetics are bland and unexciting for the most part and coupled with that most of them are overpriced for what they are. It has created a mentality with me of “these atoms are too limited and precious to spend so I have to save them for something cool”, but the something cool has yet to come.  You need to add some wild and unexpected cosmetics to the shop to convince people to buy, and you need to lower the price to a more reasonable 500 atoms per skin so that it doesn’t feel like atoms are so fucking precious like they currently do, to encourage people to actually impulse buy a skin for a dollar or 2.  
---
This is the direction you should be moving in, as it’ll both get the store generating income, and also the general buzz about these skins would be positive. You guys could really use some positive headlines for once. If you’re instead going to move in this current direction of selling game altering bandaid consumables, you’re going to lose people. You’re going to lose me, and not just on this game, from this point forward I will just skip Bethesda games in general as there is way too many good games that aren’t pulling this fucking garbage to waste my time here bitching about it with you.  I’m here bitching about it right now because I want this game to succeed and I love BGS games in general but between this current turn in fallout, and the mess of micro transactions that Blades currently is, my good will is gone. You’re no longer on my “buy it without looking at reviews” list. That’s a bummer and it’s not something I ever expected to say about what was my favourite game studio.
---
I know the caps up to 92. Most of those are the scorchbeast. Saw those as 50, 60, 80 and then 92 being the queen. Highest ground enemies ive seen are level 68 charred ghouls, 71 Fog Crawlers and 91 Deathclaws. Awol events are just 40 and 52 gusties for me and never saw them higher elsewhere. Even when running silos.
---
Concept is really great, only real concern is clan stash limit. Obviously Beth can’t make it infinite and the player stash makes storing junk items like excess plastic a non-worry so there wouldn’t need to be much space if you’re just wanting to store ammo and high-level pieces of armor. Best limit I can think of is 500, keeps the lag manageable and stash is accessible to all players who would have access to it. Locked or empty to players not apart of the clan. All in all, really good concept!
---
For a more serious answer:       
---
Scrap every gun and armor you aren't using.  That's how you learn mods.        
---
Check out https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks to play with various builds and see what you like .  You dont have to keep utility perks like lock picking equipped all the time.  
---
Ammosmith and Super Duper are good friends to have
---
For the rest, take your time, explore, kill stuff.  This game is at it's best,  in my opinion, when you're just sort of wandering around discovering things :)
---
Its been said that high charisma influences spawning 3-star enemies more frequently and high luck influences the chance of 3-star loot more frequently. I have personally experienced getting much more 3-star loot as a result of having a character with those stats maxed and then buffed into the 20s.
---
Yeah that's a possibility. Fun fact, Rad-X Dilluted doesn't suppress mutations. I pop those along with Ghoulish perk and my power armor to do nuke zones. Usually don't have any friends on to use rad sponge.
---
Usually 1-2 hours I think.
---
Thanks for that tip!
---
I honestly have nothing to say other than YAY item renaming! One o my favorite fallout 4 features. Surprised it wasn’t implemented sooner but this is awesome!
---
I have a 17 luck right now. All of my loot drops are at 100% condition.
---
Personally different fissures should generate different Bosses, like a mutated Rad Scorpion, or mutated Deathclaw that i just as hard if not harder then the SBQ. At least make it so it's triggered by players and gives times for others to come and assist.
---
i better get saving then!
---
Yea its true. Energy, heavy, and plasma weapons got buffed. I guess the game won't crash as much as it use to. Lots of mission quest got fixed. And obviously glitches too. You missed out on one limited time event and alot of store items too if it matters to you. The game is packed with stuff to do so it's up to you to play
---
What are you doing?
---
Yep, that works. Sent a message on Xbox. I’ll try to be on when they come back up, but if I cant, I’ll message you when I get back.
---
Exactamundo
---
I have seen them post on other threads yesterday though.
---
That's no prob. 😊 I use .308 most of the time as well, but another high level gave me last week a lot of them. So I have absolutely no problem sharing them! 😊 Shotgun I only have a few, but better than nothing. 😉 Cause I've shredded mine  by mistake at a workbench... 😭 It was a brutal one with quite good precision and distance... 😭 Use it most of the time inside buildings... Well, now I have to take my Skiing Sword... 😉 I'm from Germany, so how about your time being online? Tomorrow I will be back again in West Virginia! 20 pm German time... 😉 But I won't have any problems with coming online at am in the night for giving you the ammo, if you're from the states for example! 😉 Just send me a message. 🙋🏻‍♀️
---
I played for the first time the other day.. knowing most everyone was going to be a bloodied build I took out my 1* executioner lever and pretty much 1 shot anyone I saw with vats crit. Paired that with a piece of chameleon armor and I did quite well. From what I saw in pvp you shouldn’t be running around in any PA, you just make yourself a bigger and much easier target
---
I just found him and got him down to one hit left to kill and the servers just disconnected for maintenance
---
I'm on xbox and I'm updating the patch now.
---
hahahaha yes i am and i am not afraid to admit it.  Bought this game last year, played maybe 2 hours of it and then moved on to other games with my friends.  But happy to say that i have gotten back into after starting to play Fallout 4 again.
---
Will we be getting a statement on the community outcry a couple days ago in the upcoming inside the vault?
---
I still have no idea why the best even for legendaries (uranium fever) doesn't drop max level weapons
---
Yesterday I gave a spine and skull to someone.  Then gave my finger guns greeting.
---
Looks and sounds great! Look forward to the new stuff.
---
Finally a reason to carry binoculars.
---
LOL, if that chases me down I'm laughing my azz off the whole time
---
Fuck a level 50 mole rat, hate those, they’ll track you halfway across the map
---
Even with renaming, this is the best goddamn thing in this patch.
---
Master-Baiter and fukurban must really set her off
---
Curses!
---
That anti-armor super sledge is a near perfect roll
---
Yes, the game needs more caps sinks. Yes, rolling legendaries is one of the few activities that would provide value to nearly any player.   
---
Unfortunately it doesn't sound like Bethesda is going that direction, based upon what they've already shared, though it is possible that the legendary vendor will require tokens and caps, or might take lots of caps instead of fewer tokens. I guess we'll find out next month.
---
Very strange. Must be a new bug. I’ll add it to my list of things to confirm when I have time... that list is getting too long!
---
Lmao!
---
It makes me so happy when high level players are nice and share and help it makes me so happy! 
---
Some higher level than me guy was shooting up my camp and a very high level guy came and merked him for me which was so nice!
---
Another high level guy followed me when I was level 10 and I was scared (and I don’t have a mic) but he did and he said “here use these when you are a higher level” and GAVE ME THE SERUM FOR MARSUPIAL AND BIRD BONES and I cried in real life cuz I always wanted marsupial and thanks to him once I turned a high enough level I used it with starched genes and now the game is even MORE enjoyable than ever!
---
I don’t often join teams/accept team invites (due to lack of mic) but on the rare occasion I do everyone has been so nice! They always help the low level people with missions and XP and it just is so wonderful!
---
I’m only level 41 but I also try to help the lower level guys too because it’s the right thing to do and making people happy is so fulfilling :)
---
Some gave me a lengendary dragon at lvl 10 if u see this bro your a legend
---
I'm not disagreeing with you that it can be used to your advantage, but that's a result of smart play and being better than others + being on the leaderboard - not a direct reward obtained from simply being on the leaderboard in position 1,2 or 3. A direct reward for JUST being on the leaderboard would be here is a cap multiplier for every kill you get while on the leaderboard or here is a cool legendary weapon etc
---
Dude I know your pain. I've had like 3 in a row 1* wood pieces from beastly 3* legendaries lately. So mood destroying
---
No problem. They aren’t going anywhere. :)
---
Hahaha! Love it
---
&gt;Insult Bot: The Insult Bot will now insult you.
---
This one is also in the top 3 best fixes...
---
A few more:
---
\- Where is the new dungeon? A: Next patch
---
\- Where is the legendary vendor? A: May 23rd patch
---
\- Where is player vending? A: Sometime in May
---
\- Where are the repair kits? A: Next patch
---
\- When will the servers be up? A: When they are done.
---
&gt; Scoreboards: Map highlights for the top 3 ranked players are now based on the Players Killed Scoreboard rather than Longest Life.   
---
Good ! It will certainly change the dynamic of this mod !
---
Just to add as a person wit little time to play. When upper level people help out it’s so helpful.
---
I really hope turrets count as 'creatures' for this update.
---
Booze, knick knacks that are preserved, clean, and /Or sealed, and whatever resource I'm mining at camp for at wholesale price in bulk form
---
Seriously, praise Atom.
---
Matriarch Deathclaw with a dose of nuclear steroids courtesy of Uncle Sam, who during the fight calls his sons
---
deathclaws  everywhere
---
I wish all were marked as fissure sites. It only makes sense.
---
Wait so we still have to see nonstop whine threads about repair kits and a bunch of misleading internet news articles from Kotaku and Engadget for an undetermined amount of time?
---
Crap.
---
Zoning laws... just like every city across the land, they have zoning laws. 
---
They could just red out most future build areas OR give warning that your camp will have to move due to zoning, then you could move it. 
---
They already tell us where we can’t build so they should be able to do this pretty easily.
---
Yep replied to wrong person. Thought you were the OP. My apologies.
---
how much would someone be willing to pay for this weapon?
---
That gatling gun would be super powerful in the right hands. I'm on the Xbox but I doubt I could afford it.
---
I don't understand why they're doing both things. Why not just do the combined cap storage to 1400? I don't understand why every faction has to be at the white spring? It doesn't seem to be very lore friendly change. Why would the BOS or free states have a vendor at White spring? It just doesn't make sense
---
Yea but are 8 of 10 still 1 Star?
---
I'm excited for this. I keep finding myself coming back to this game, even with all the negativity. I really hope it keeps this forward momentum.
---
Thanks bro
---
If you on ps4 send me a pm. Me and my group could always use something extra to do.
---
Yes even stopped before I engaged to make sure
---
Thanks for the reply, 
---
So now after lvl 50 you're getting a card-pack every 5 levels? Does it stop at any level?
---
How much would you want for it?
---
That still doesn’t seem misogynist to me, even if you had known what it meant. Consensual coitus is not misogynist.
---
Thanks for the advice! When maintenace is done today I want to give it a shot again, hopefully I can find a team in a lobby. How do you bypass pipe repair?
---
Card packs every 5 levels. At each level over 50 you can choose to pick a card or switch a perk point. See posters at train stations to open BREWING quest. PvP mode available when joining game. Duping fixed as far as I can tell. Better stability. But...new patch so.... larger camp budget and storage in stash boxes expanded to 800 lbs. Bobby pins and heavy energy guns adjusted for proper weight/ longevity. You missed a lot. Welcome back.
---
Insult bot will now insult us! Yay!
---
Didn’t someone get transported there by mistake in a horde event a week or two ago and was able to solo the ghouls there?
---
You must be the descendant of a long line of proud European gigolos who were bestowed with such an honorable name for providing “services” to the ladies of the medieval court.
---
I think it is great!
---
+1
---
HALT!
---
Twice last night they game didn’t crash but went straight back to the xBox home screen and Fallout wasn’t even running to quit. 
---
This happens on Mondays when there’s an update every time for me.
---
Yeah, I've only done it one time (way back ago) but it ranges from hordes of scorched ghouls to scorched Yao Guai, Mirelurks, Fog Crawlers, etc. 
---
I was playing a melee monster at the time and when I couldn't do any Queen bashing I cleared the minion wave.
---
.. and sometimes they decide to let you use a bed even when there's a corpse and your head clips through the headboard. lol
---
[https://imgur.com/a/cAOWCSJ](https://imgur.com/a/cAOWCSJ)
---
you always got perk card packs after level 50. it's every 5 levels. what they added was when you level up, you can either pick a new single perk card OR move one SPECIAL stat point.
---
other notable changes include a new quest that unlocks drink crafting stations (just wander the Vault Tec University area until you find a poster advertising a frat party, they're all over), Two-Shot Explosive weapons got nerfed (that's what happens when a weapon can one-shot other players with slap damage, or two-shot the Scorchbeast Queen by themselves), and the Fascnact Parade event (which is over now, and mainly offered cosmetic rewards like masks and camp items, but it was a huge hit so maybe they'll bring it back next year)
---
This comment 🤣 Best thing I've read today😂
---
RIP the 4 people using kinect
---
I'm glad this isn't just me - I was worried I'd scrapped the ID somehow. I'll have to check if I still have it when I next get in-game.
---
I’m on Xbox, you’re more than welcome to add me.  If I’m on and you want some help with those silos just shoot me a message. The extra xp while on a team perk card is super helpful when grinding out those levels.  I frequently try to team up with some lower levels so they can get that xp boost and just go about doing my own thing and fast travel to them if they ask for help or if I see that they’ve gotten into some trouble. Some people still like to try things on their own, knowing that I’m there in the “background” if they need help.
---
You can also start the patch download its 2GB on the pc.
---
**Scoreboards:** Map highlights for the top 3 ranked players are now based on the Players Killed Scoreboard rather than Longest Life.   
---
Awesome!!
---
Ah! A mole ra-
---
Oh \*ahem\* Sorry. Mistook you for something else.
---
I'd love to mount enemy cryptid  heads on the wall of my cabin with a set of neon letters above spelling out "Crikey"
---
Had your fill Jim ;)
---
There's a locked door in the room with the pipes. Unlock it, go in, kill turrets, go into the adjoining room, there's a terminal. You need lvl 3 hacker. On the terminal you can bypass the repair part. It will open the door and you can go from there to the next part of the silo
---
I am loving this QoL changes and I’m excited to play the new quests!
---
With the fixes to survival, maybe I’ll try it out again. Not for the PvP, but the XP. If the main targets are those will the highest kills instead of longest life, I don’t have to worry so much about being able to quest and explore. Plus if I do die, I won’t lose most of my caps haha.
---
You forgot about adding ultracite Gatling lasers to the legendary list!
---
Insult bot now insults. The fix we needed
---
Oh you Fuckers!
---
"and here we have the first Mothman I killed"
---
"aren't you in a cult that worships mothman?"
---
"yeah but this one was a dick."
---
&gt; Insult Bot: The Insult Bot will now insult you.
---
o boy
---
Agh! Suxs just when I want to play after being away for two weeks lol
---
Oh man if only they'd release a Lincoln's Repeater skin for the lever action rifle. That was my all time favorite lever action from any Fallout.
---
As far as pay-to-win goes, that is about the tamest pay-to-win I've ever seen. It's more like pay for convenience.
---
Durability on weapons with gunsmith perk is crazy now. I don't repair my weapons for days at a time, I don't see how repair kits are pay-to-win at all.
---
Sweet! Thanks!
---
i DON'T KNOW WHAT DUMB F\*\*\*\* downvoted my comment, but he's an id\*\*\*...  
---
Anyway, it must be a bug then, thanks, because I'm not suppressing anything and 100% do have the mutation, I've even got my friend to try it, and even they are having there food regenerate when they eat vegtables!
---
Woo they buffed my alpine horn!
---
I’m interested in buying the anti armor sledge, TSE gauss or 4 start furious machete if they’re for sale. Also have trades
---
Those curios sound fun, espaecially Gorzilla, the spider-ape.
---
Ah. Sorry. If you're to lose your camp location, I hope something really cool goes there.
---
Yep that is literally me LOL
---
4.5 GB on PS4, wonder what you guys are missing in patch
---
Try to get a gas mask and keep it in your stash or inventory. It prevents certain diseases in places like the ash heap. Also try to only pick up the ammunition you need. It doesn't weigh much but it definitely adds up.
---
Dupers should be banned, at the same time there are plenty who picked up bags left by dupers before the weight changes. 
---
They unknowingly picked them up and even if they dumped it all it still registers as having had the items they scanned for. 
---
I saw a few with literally tons in the bags and it looked like a trap!...lol
---
Putting it in the overseers stash prevents others from getting it tho?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bb8c7d/wild_appalachia_patch_notes_april_9_2019/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
This is a really good patch. Thank you for the awesome work and openness to feedback!
---
Yeah that one was the best today ! Hurray :)
---
Microsoft os discontinuing support for the Kinect too right?
---
That will be pretty helpful! That part was pretty tedious. One last thing - a friend of mine said you can turn the turrets off/make them attack the other robots, but I hacked a ton of terminals in that place and never saw the option. A lot of times the terminal would freeze up when I entered them so I had no time to see the options before getting shot again. Are there any other useful terminals in a silo that will help make things easier?
---
3.83 gigs on xbox
---
How did I miss that?!?
---
No I've missed shots in vats crit
---
Wow, the PA compass actually works now! If it shows the same sensitivity to locations as when out of PA, I may not hate using PA as much now
---
Maybe its bloodied explosive weapons they are using idk
---
Heh, MODUS even had some testing along with the AI that would become "President Eden", they specifically talked about his "interest" in some historical records before the IT guys cut the test link off.
---
I've done the Brotherhood quests I believe. I'm not sure about the Enclave. How do I trigger the questline?
---
I wish it scared hostile creatures away when used
---
Its a ghouls legend
---
Maybe, can't confirm though because I almost never even see the player let alone check how much health they have :s
---
Yay my alpine horn will be heard by all!
---
"Cryogenic or Incendiary Legendary Mods" 
---
Are these going to show up in the game now?
---
Not sure I only play fallout 76 on my Stadia
---
I have a TSE gatling and TSE pump and i can't kill ppl in one shot
---
Came here to say this, that's such a welcome change, I was losing my mind this weekend trying a new VATS focused build on the SBQ.
---
Finally! I always invite people/message them mentioning the bonus exp but they never want to join. I usually do my own thing and rock a Fallout Spotify radio as I grind. So yeah, once server maintenance is down I'll be back online to work on it. The 15% bonus exp and assistancr with the silo would be really helpful.
---
Mama dolces food processing plant was a food processor gone wrong
---
Yes, we need a radioactive super hog
---
Tse did get nerfed.. it's nowhere near the most powerful PvP weapon now. You could just never get shot from such range in adventure because you had to "agree" to PvP first. It's already been needed to hell. Leave it alone  already!
---
Insult Bot will now Insult :0
---
Right Now Im willing to part with the Sledge and the Furious for a good trade or Caps
---
Insult Bot followed me about a 3rd of the way across the map the other day. I felt like I had a companion! Please let companions be a thing someday.
---
Love whats happening in this patch. The survival mode changes will be welcome. I took the Lead Belly and Cannibal perks to deal with the loss of all my aid items. Pretty nice combo of perks actually. :)
---
now that's a pretty sexy patch
---
Oh really? Yeah I never did that event because that bot often got stuck somewhere to the point where I didnt bother to do it anymore. Guess I have to give that a try again. Thanks.
---
I *knew* that music in harpers ferry had to be underground! Now I can hopefully turn off the damned radio playing it.
---
I've built the excavator armor and have done some questing in the Toxic Valley. It just is hard to know what quests I haven't done. I'm not so worried about Miscellaneous quests, but actual full lines.
---
Reminds me of when some guy requested my Calibrated Paladin Legs I was wearing in my PA at the time haha
---
Adre naline perk aslo effect your dmg output
---
Haha nice little beast you made there
---
Sure its Two-shot and not Bloodied?  Two shot has been significantly nerfed, but bloodied can get some insane damage.
---
Drive-by pearl clutching
---
Sounds like that's more the issue 👍
---
&gt;Items: Equipping Armor with Cryogenic or Incendiary Legendary Mods no longer causes the wearer to become hostile toward attacking players in Adventure Mode prior to returning fire.
---
Armor with Cryogenic or Incendiary Legendary perks?  I didn't even know that was a thing.
---
All I’m saying is it would be a cool feature.
---
So powerful and efficient it could influence your body to stay awake
---
Could be BE or IE. TSE is not that powerful anymore.
---
&gt;Compass: While wearing Power Armor, Map and Quest markers no longer appear misaligned from their actual locations in the Compass.
---
as a power armor user, this is a god send
---
From Raiders quest you get told to find the remainers of the Free States.
---
&gt; Exactly!
---
Still no Firecracker Whiskey? Sad.
---
Yes indeed! I really happy with the new V.A.T.S. design/fix! and vendors ofc! :)
---
Overall a pretty good patch I'd say.
---
My first reaction too.  "Wait, this is a thing?"
---
Beat me to it.
---
yes, let's replace them with radscorps
---
If you saw 4 people killing a person in the street would it bother you and would you question it?
---
If I saw 4 people killing a person in the streets of Watoga, Flatwoods, Huntersville, or any other place in the video game, it wouldn’t bother me.  I might decide to assist the outnumbered person.  I might decide to assist the four players.  I might decide to grab some popcorn and watch, or carry on my way.  
---
If I saw the same thing in real life, I’d call the cops.
---
This is a video game.  In it, we’ve all done things we wouldn’t normally in real life, such as trespassing and stealing, let alone assault and murder.  Most players wouldn’t shoot an animal in real life, but don’t hesitate to do so in-game.
---
Morals should be left in the Vault where they belong.  Except Vault-Tec ran all sorts of experiments in the vaults, so morals didn’t really exist there, either.
---
It’s dangerous to go alone.  It’s dangerous to go in groups.  It’s just dangerous out there.
---
Maybe it is bloodied + explosive then. That's what everyone seems to be saying. It is unbelievably overpowered whatever it is as there is no possible way to counter it or even react if they shoot first
---
yea definitely a lot of bug fixes ...i can't  wait to actually finish swarm of suitors and get rewards for it after like 800 hours of play
---
the moment in all games when a new quest is introduced and having everyone on the server do it together, big group of players taking down sheepsquatch should be fun :)
---
THEY FIXED THE RAILWAY RIFLE GOD BLESS
---
Oh wow so not just regular usual scorched people! That’s crazy!
---
But that’s awesome that you were able to help, I’m sure the additional enemies really hinder any progress so having people focus on them is a good idea. Awesome! I just love how everyone teams up that is so neat!
---
A young Scandinavian guy, Skard, was 5 years old when bombs exploded. He was son of 2 fellow Norwegian people, Freyja and Ragnar migrated to USA in middle of their life. He entered Vault 76 with his family. He was the bully in Vault 76, and was hated by most. When the reclaimation day came, he got out of the vault just after the Overseer. He never liked the Overseer but he followed her steps around Wasteland. While wandering one day, He found about this "Enclave" faction, and thought "whoa, what these people made was interesting!". He did all he can do and joined the ranks of long lost West Virginian Enclave. Today, He claps everyone's ass in his Prototype Power Armor called X-01 (he always wanted to use one of these) and a Gatling Plasma which was also designed by Enclave.
---
His build is Heavy guns build focusing on highest possible damage per bullet.
---
Any plan can drop in high level loot lists, like lvl 3 safes
---
Why don't people link to the patch webpage anymore?
---
Dude i'm level 30 something, i dont even have a build yet and still i wreck almost every high level i encounter, because of positioning. Weapon damage is in a good shape right now, i can fairly trade with anyone and win most of the time because people rely to much on VATS.
---
Hah, my gamer tag LordJesusChrst gets a lot of attention at times,  but not as much as when it was UncleTouchHole
---
I invite the whole server and if low levels join I give them a bunch of legendaries that I hoard. It really helps my stash feel lighter.
---
Everything looks pretty good except the change to cap rewards in survival : why do we only get 25% caps for killing someone now? I thought it was meant to be big risk or reward. Not only that there still seems to be no penalty for walking around with no caps in your pocket.
---
Bethesda you need to add incentives to play game modes, as of right now you are removing incentives to play survival, being on the leaderboards provides no reward, now you get chump change for killing people in it. It's literally 4 times for profitable to kill people in adventure mode now...
---
I've noticed that there's still a weird compass inaccuracy when it comes to Emotes, though.  If you wave at a player, sometimes everything gets a bit offset.  It's been that way since November, but I think it may be limited to third-person mode, as the way to fix it is to go into first-person and back again.
---
You could always get card packs after level 50. I think after level 15 (or 20?) it is once every 5 levels.
---
signs and letters can drop from defending a workshop ...i have 800 hours have defeated her a ton never got a serum recipe
---
In the latest Patch Notes, this is written:
---
&gt;**Items:** Resources that  glowing creatures drop as loot in nuke zones, such as Glowing Mass and  Hardened Mass, are now instanced for all players who deal damage to  those creatures. 
---
So i wasn't wrong. Was thinking that is was just a bug or something else. So i might drop more nukes to get the sweet flux.
---
Looks like tons of great stuff here!! Lots of qol stuff and the survival changes look pretty good as well!! Overall looks great!
---
What changed?
---
Some heroes don’t wear capes
---
Are the servers up yet?
---
&gt; Exploit: Addressed an exploit that could allow players to gain a free C.A.M.P. placement. 
---
Is this the issue where if you moved your camp box, it would tell you that your camp couldn't be placed when you log in the next time? If so, great, but I'd hardly call that an exploit.
---
&gt; Compass: While wearing Power Armor, Map and Quest markers no longer appear misaligned from their actual locations in the Compass.
---
FINALLY! This has been plaguing us since launch.
---
From what I'm seeing for replies, yeah sounds like it's explosive + bloodied + some combo of damage output perks that let you one-shot through any armour
---
Looks really good Bethesda. Keep at it and thank you.
---
Insult Bot: The Insult Bot will now insult you.
---
 
---
found the most important line in the patch notes :P But for real though, holy cow so many QoL fixes now, very grateful for that :) Weehoo!
---
they said they were working on that , it's not in this patch
---
I’ve found when you build in an existing structure, you have so much more budget to work with. This is a huge help if you can find one of these locations.
---
Yes I just started playing this recently and high lvl players are giving me stuff daily! Such a godsend 🙌🏼
---
Can't say I'm too thrilled about the massively decreased penalty/reward system but I guess I'm in the minority that really appreciated the massive benefit/consequence of survival mode. I'm curious to see how this  affects engagement, if at all.
---
I still feel we need werewolves.
---
Outstanding.  Everything on the list is an improvement.  Can't wait to log on tonight.
---
And my soul a little worthier
---
I just found a wiki with quest lists, and it looks like I've done most everything... Bummer. I guess it's back to farming and respec.
---
I think all of these changes make Survival more appealing.  Reducing the amount of Aid you lose, and changing Cap loss from 200% of your level to 25%, makes it into something any character can drop into.
---
Exactly! I can’t blame them for wanting the good items, but I would rather not let people think I’m willing to trade stuff that I’m not.
---
Yeah. They ain’t gonna respond to that.
---
It was not in today's patch. They said they'd change it "soon".
---
I havent played since a month into launch but I really want to start a new character and check out the new content. What builds are viable now? I was using one that took advantage of canned dog food (perk that gave added benefits to eating it and the perk to find more cans), would that be good with a melee build (if those are still OP?).
---
Does*
---
I killed a honey beast last night and it wouldn’t let me loot it
---
This was my number one wish for Survival. Now I will play it regularly instead of avoiding it like the plague.
---
No, TSE are not overpowered. My ranged character with a max-level TSE handmade takes 5-10 shots to kill a level 68 super mutant. My melee character takes 1 or 2 swings. 
---
Melee damage is huge. Snipe damage is huge. Bloodied damage is huge. TSE damage isn't.    
---
Grounded isn't doing anything against TSE. Ironclad doesn't do much since armor has diminishing returns. Generally the only armor that matters is legendary effects with % damage reductions (assassins, sentinel, &amp; cavalier).
---
Not everyone is nice and if you enjoy fallout the best parts where npc’s that did weird annoying crap.  
---
Post apocalyptic world where everyone gives out hugs and candy seems...childish and boring.  I can’t believe what people wanted out of Fo76 was a lesser experience, its pitiful and pathetic.
---
I got mine off a random ass supermutant
---
I dare say, this is their best patch to date 
---
Especially including power armor chasis in the renaming!!
---
ah ok, your apology is accepted! :)
---
&gt;The Vault-Tec Weapons Workbench no longer changes positions after its owner Fast Travels.
---
Pleasantly surprised to see this one finally addressed. As far as I know, it's been this way for months now. I'd wanted to buy that skin, but had been holding off because I didn't want to have to neurotically re-arrange it every single time I visit my CAMP.
---
This is why people should stay on there own servers its completely cultural you don’t like it go back to the empty South American servers you sad woman who needs to belittle my mans here because she clearly couldn’t have fought him and won😂😂
---
Still upset that player Vending was delayed but still a good patch nonetheless! I’m excited to start the new questline!
---
Now that Survival is a lot "safer" I think I'll actually drop by there once. I haven't actually played Survival since it came out.
---
But hey! Look at the bright side, now you have something funny to tell to your grandkids
---
For a second there, when you said "Spanish accent" I wondered if you were the guy whose nic I saw last night.  BORDERPATROL187.  Whew.
---
I guess "187" was a reference to [Proposition 187](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_California_Proposition_187).  Someone isn't a fan of Mexicans, it would seem.
---
The Free State line maybe the only one I haven't completed. It doesn't sound familiar.
---
I am not sure, I'm never up on which things sell well. I was hoping you'd get an answer telling you how much it should sell for and then I'd try to knock a bit off that price and see if you'd take it :D
---
Yes tnx lol. ;)
---
I like to get two or three and play a tune on them all 👍
---
YES!!! You guys fixed my two biggest complaints—the railway rifle, and the damage bug on the salvaged assaultron head in the same patch. 
---
u/lonevaultwanderer, u/jessbethesda thanks so much , I love you guys :)
---
Ahhh, very good to know about the armor reduction not affecting energy damage!
---
Better accessability  of products and resources under one roof.
---
&gt;Insult Bot: The Insult Bot will now insult you.  
---
Finally some progress being made
---
Everything was nerfed to death for the sake of multiplayer. It's lame.
---
No I don't play this game for PVP
---
It definitely seems to be the case that trolls stay in adventure because actual PVP players shit on them in survival lol
---
yeah, now that it marks the top player killers rather than those that survive longer makes it much more appealing.
---
I was going to add that I'm excited for a new quest, but I figured we all would be. You're right though, definitely going to be fun seeing most if not all the server pounding that sheepsquatch into the ground haha!
---
Oh wow that's even better
---
Thnx
---
My big concern with this mod was that I could be seen as one of the 3 best survivor of the server (as if I was dangerous) with my level 10 character, and hunted by level 150 fully equiped players. (true story). Finding a player higher than me is ok, but being pointed was a bad idea, in my opinion.
---
Definitely not me lol
---
Does the arcing effect to other nearby enemies work with all 3 barrel mods, or just certain ones?
---
Well, i was clearly wrong about living longest, they are now most kills. So probably wrong about the seasons thing too, although i think it was said during PAX live stream.
---
The positive thing is these lists keep getting shorter.
---
Yeah my camp only costs 9 caps to fast travel to WS
---
Nope, still undergoing maintenance
---
Ah yes, that happens now and then unfortunately! Least it wasn't a 3* legendary :P
---
Same.
---
Can I get a Reverse Survival mode, where it's just me and I have God Mode activated at all times?
---
4.587 on PS4 if we gotta be exact lol
---
Nah I'm sticking to adventure for the most part, the limited fast-travel gets annoying. Also losing caps.
---
I don't hack the turrets. So I can't answer that part, sorry. I enjoy killing everything myself
---
so many good fixes, this is a good patch.
---
I know it wouldnt fit in WV but a Hodag would be a fitting fallout creature
---
Some people literally have nothing better to do with their lives, which always makes me just feel really bad for them more than anything, like how sad do you have to be to find that enjoyable
---
I'm currently using mine as a door bell xD.
---
&gt;You're over-relying on personal experience and ignoring obvious facts.
---
No I'm relying on personal experience and ignoring you.
---
isn't it just reduced caps loss? Regardless, there's still plenty of us that don't care for PvP &gt;.&gt;
---
Oh ! This is what I'm looking for. Do you still have the links in your history?
---
While this could work as an explaination for FO76 to FO3, this doesn't work for FO3 to NV to FO4.
---
As each game following FO3 is later in the timeline and each iteration of the AB post FO3 is less powerful.
---
Thumbs up on the oblivious, "I'm the only player in the world" types.  I'm lvl. 199 and routinely team up with lower levels and cooperate with no mics or texting.  I don't like to team with random players that much, but will sometimes, ( just my solo, yet friendly, adventurer attitude), but I get alot of these types of encounters and mostly it turns out well for everyone.  I'm melee dominant and can usually one hit with my Furious grog, once it gets going.  I switch to my Vamp grog which usually takes 2-3 whacks, for these encounters and more often than not just kite a group over to them, let them get some shots in, then finish them off.  Nearly always get a wave. I never run in my PA, to save core power, and you can always tell who the greedy players are, (older and younger alike), because they will rush ahead of you at full speed into the buildings and try to wipe out everything before 'ole grandpa gets there.  I usually just move on to the next bunch.  I'm not saying all younger players are selfish players mind you.  At 59, nearly everyone I play with is a younger player.
---
Oh, the Fast Travel thing is a good point. The cap loss will be insignificant I feel now. Or at least it will be a mosquito bite.
---
Right!  I’ve been so annoyed trying to VATS and hitting my teammates haha.
---
They aren't missing anything, updates are just downloaded differently on consoles.  For PC, they only need to download the specific changes.  For PS and Xbox, the code is organized into "modules" and if a single line of code is updated, it has to download the entire module again.  That's why there are different download sizes for each device.
---
People who really dislike pvp will still play it.  I use it for vendor runs still.  Which should take about 5 minutes now that the cap pool is combined :-D
---
Losing 500c a death was never very appealing,  but 62c is a lot easier to be ok with.
---
Sounds like you need to read my comments closer. I never said that I had a problem with my armor.
---
If you have Tank Killer, an AA weapon just wont give you much more damage. Look at the Incisor with AA weapon, you’re hitting 90% with everything but that’s only an increase of ~12% AA which translates to about 7% actual damage dealt. 
---
For builds using AA perks and (working) AA mods, an AA weapon is trash. Less damage than Mutant’s +10% and selling on Reddit for 10x the cost. Also, it just doesn’t work on energy weapons. 
---
AA weapons are great for weapons that don’t have AA perks. Shotguns, pistols etc. The most possible actual damage increase it can give is about 28%
---
Some people never outgrew being edgy high school and it shows in times like that
---
And they changed the top 3 to be based on player skills vs time survived
---
Definitely wouldn't surprise me.
---
I've been passively on the lookout for the Combat Armor Dense mod.  I had one once, which I applied to my 2\* Vanguard's chest.  And then I started moving toward Unyielding and that piece fell out of use.  It's not a big deal though.  I don't have a 3\* Unyielding chest or anything, and I know now that I really shouldn't apply the mod to anything less.
---
I'd be happy with that, but I'd also like the option for 1 friend to drop in and out on my adventures like a companion. While I enjoy 76 I don't want ES6 to be another 76.
---
And while I play solo most of the time the idea of sharing the adventure with my friend is a nice idea to me.
---
I don't play PVP games that have auto-aim.
---
So many things in this changelog tell me that Bethesda is actually listening to the fanbase- something which I have seen many games die from the lack of doing. I really don't want to relive the two years I wasted on Paragon...
---
Wow if all this works correctly,it's my favourite patch so far.
---
Interesting
---
Agreed game play should stay in game but there has to be some correlation between what happens in game and in real life not to say that everyone is gonna go out there and start killing people.  But some might feel a release or feel enjoyment out of it as my killers seem to have.  My question is who(personality) and why have that kind of enjoyment. For aggression.  Totally bucking it up to game play is a cop out.  Morals follows us wherever we go we can’t just shut the down.  Love the it’s dangerous bit!
---
Pets are safe now.
---
I would love that! I would love to get some wins under my belt! my IGN is JanynFletcher :)
---
Really nice set up!
---
I don't actually remember it being fixed after the last time it broke.
---
Yes except for the Enclave, you will still need to go to the Enclave bunker to buy X01 mods, scout armour, mutation serums etc but they will share the 1400 caps pool
---
I always go in with the tesla gun so I hit a maximum target at once + no one shot frags so it leaves room for other to frag them too.  
---
But I had to do this because of the exact reason you pointed out.
---
I wouldn't hold your breath
---
The VATS thing is a good change. I was doing a meet up with a large group and when enemies spawned I kept accidentally hitting these people in VATS instead of the enemies. Good that VATS will now see through them.
---
If they allow us to harvest honey they should allow us to make mead! I love mead
---
Yeah I buy a grape and an orange everyday to use during nuke zones. there's also a grape in the TNT dome 7 so in theory you could collect to grape a day.
---
Yep, they may be an edgy high schooler as most of their posts were either here or r/teenagers.
---
I've learned to just "block out the haters" so to speak.
---
 I'm so fucking surprised, an actually good patch notes from Bethesda.
---
Not just a few lines repeated over and over, missing a lot of changes.
---
If I feel too insulted the Insult Bot's gonna get a kick in the ball bearings....
---
roger that! I was the only shotgunner there so I think I was the one getting her to land but it was a shit show for sure...
---
Fallout 4 with mods?
---
I think they've proven now without a doubt,they just don't care what the gaming news industry says.
---
Good or ill- they just don't care
---
I’ve dropped into Survival for a few hours and I definitely had fun with the mode. Stalking random players was a good amount of fun and stealthily transiting likely-populated areas while trying to remain unseen/unheard was often tense and a good change of pace. But I’m going to keep most of my activities in Adventure, I imagine. My wife doesn’t like seeing me stressed.
---
Good on you for enjoying Survival as much as you have.
---
They could make it so that there are servers that only allow the "Pay to win" players on it.
---
Maybe I haven’t read well enough but are we not getting player vending today? Road map states April 9 but otherwise very nice patch now to see how stable the games frame rate is.
---
IIRC the bloodlust had a special kill animation in fallout 4 if they could kill you, kind if like the deathclaws.
---
oh you know what good point, even my machine did that a time or two!
---
Oh this stuff again can we not please
---
Yeah, its been back for a while. I thought it was weird I hadn't seen any mention of it, and after not seeing it in todays patch notes I figured I would address it here.
---
just because it's explosive doesn't mean it's a two shot, it could be anything or even a one star explosive, but it's probably either instigating or bloodied, furious is also good but instigating and bloodied are the best at the moment
---
The win in p2w does not mean winning in PvP only.
---
Ill play for a bit if ya can hop on
---
Still no fix for Grognaks Axe :(
---
&gt;**Scoreboards:** Map highlights for the top 3 ranked players are now based on the Players Killed Scoreboard rather than Longest Life.
---
Amen to that! I liked playing survival (you never know what to expect) but I always killed myself if I got onto the scoreboard since I'm playing with a new char and don't have the unlimited legendaries yet
---
Indeed! Also every patch they usually fix a few things off each of the other lists, which is nice to see!
---
Known issue from back around Patch 6 or so when they made Mods not get auto consumed when Repairing or Crafting.
---
They have said they cannot fix it until they design a new classification of item to separate Bulk out.
---
Well ironically they just changed how it works hahahah
---
My wild speculation is that its wrapped up with player vending
---
Survival mode becomes viable now with the massive reduction to caps lost. I go from losing 300 to 40
---
It would be really nice if this is truly the case!  However, the AlpHorn is NOT heard by anyone else other than the person "activate"ing it ... at least this is how it has been since it was introduced. Making it louder is one thing ... making it able to be heard by other nearby players would make sense, even if it isn't mentioned as such in these patch notes.
---
I don't believe that is accurate
---
Thats funny you say that because that is what happens, usually they always say " steal" so I just go ahead and do it. 90% of the time nothing happens, this time I got tagged and wanted...:)
---
What's in this update?
---
Yes we should totally ignore a glaring issue by pretending it doesn't exist and that it'll never affect us.
---
Any chance on getting a location for this?  never heard of it until now.  wouldn't mind giving it a go myself.  :)
---
It's pretty easy to not read them if you don't want to.
---
That is devistating news but at least now I know and can relay that to my team.
---
No Im not, was totally my fault and I really wanted the bounty gone.
---
Dropped 150 Radaway, 50 purified water, and a ton of bulk for some unsuspecting low level player last night. He kept following me and giving me the thumbs up.
---
It's Reclamation Day! \[Patch 8 Edition!!\]
---
Nope, it's fresh. :-|
---
The default position of many players in Survival was hostile.  I think by toning down the rewards a little bit, that may become less automatic, which would be a good thing.
---
Agreed. I was actually hoping for Repair Kits today :( Seriously!: I can't continue to repair my items extensively due to running out of resources all the time. A Repair Kit would dramatically save me no doubt about it.
---
Hopefully Bethesda says something about it because I too am sick of the false claims being made by 'game journalists' and edgy players.
---
Or do the new quest that's out today!
---
Until a gutsy dealing *ballistic* damage hits you. Outherwise it lands with all the force of a wet paper towel.
---
Oh believe me, I scroll past them and if I could figure out how to filter them from the feed altogether I would ;)
---
You should be good now. I was level 28/29 when I went to top of the world. I’d just done some of the ash heap. The divide isn’t toooo bad depending on where you go. A good tip, just check the map before going because of a high level is there then hard enemies spawn. At your level everything will be easier, as long as it’s only you there.
---
Hopefully after this patch it blows the door right off it's hinges into your guests. haha
---
Whitesprings has become a defacto player hub because of its central location and the safety provided by the bots.  It makes sense that this would be a nice neutral zone for the in-game factions as well.  Even raiders probably wouldn't mess with people, lest they anger the Sentry Bots (though they'd probably set up just outside the perimeter for ambushes).
---
Not my concern.  Someone else needs to parent their kids, not me.
---
Yup, the reduction of caps/aids loss in pvp, specifically stating we'll be able to rename power chassis, the alcohol challenges...
---
These are just some of the things i've seen people complaining about right here on reddit. They are indeed listening.
---
Three weeks ago, and yup, he did solo it.
---
Wait, does it mean you can't VATS survival players with weapon sheathed?
---
That would really nerf VATS Critical Sniper builds.
---
Anyone can confirm?
---
&gt;Player-built Turrets are now affected by player PvP damage rules, which feature damage scaling, as well as an increase in base damage for all types of Turrets, ranging from +15% to +100% damage depending the Turret.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Additionally, Turret attack ranges have been increased to match players’ weapon ranges.  
---
&gt;The Shotgun Turret’s projectile spread has been reduced to better match the Combat Shotgun.  
---
&gt;These changes should help Turrets in C.A.M.P.s and Workshops pose a bigger and more consistent threat against attackers.
---
Finally my pretties will sing their glorious song of death.
---
My place is at the very bottom of the map in the savage divide, nobody ever comes down there and its near enough to watoga/whitesprings
---
Saw that too.  Another 20lb choice for my sniper...
---
Have you tried it? You will notice a difference.
---
I'm a high level player with about 25 high level friends, we're all on xbox. PM me if you're interested, we're constantly trading items/ammo/materials and could share if you need anything.
---
They aren't chests exactly but each and every container has a great chance for a lot of caps (~30-70) and each pool has at least one of container like that (meat bags, green footlockers)
---
lol i don't want all that i still love a good challenge  I just choose games like COD ect.. for my pvp fix
---
My apologies, guys.  I definitely didn't search the topic before creating a new one.
---
I'd love to go HogZilla hunting with a spear
---
The more Cryptids the merrier
---
I understand it can be something else. I stopped playing when TSE were everywhere and the most OP thing so it's what I assumed they were using, hence why I asked if they'd been nerfed because I couldn't believe a nerfed TSE was still that strong
---
Yeah then idk. Best make white russians lol
---
I rebound mine to T, as backspace is just ridiculous
---
my experience as well. sometimes when they drop nothing I just needed to wait around 20 seconds and a legendary item suddenly pops up in their inventory
---
Well done, best update yet!
---
It just feels like a dead horse im against paid anything as well but the amount of post are definitely gonna amp up as soon as the servers are up and i dont think any one is excited to see the "PAID ITEM IM NOW PAY TO WIN NOT CLICKBAIT" stuff thats gonna all over here and youtube no offence to you by any means man
---
F.I.N.A.L.L.Y:  **V.A.T.S.:** No longer targets friendly or neutral players or creatures.
---
Events are your best source of caps but pick up everything is my recommendation and remember where you find a lot of one kind of junk because I always run out of one thing
---
it is coming in future patch by the looks of the latest patch notes
---
Good info! yay!
---
Ooooh, I’ll take the 50 cal and axe if you don’t want them :D
---
Thanks for the tip! I'll try it out. I think I was lvl 15 when I explored there initially.
---
Yous right
---
so still gotta wait then. sigh
---
according to the VDSG it affects condition and value of loot dropped.
---
Yes, once you complete the initial alcohol brewing quest line if you return to him each day, after 8 PM EST, you can get a new daily quest to do.  Sometimes you'll be given a recipe automatically that appears in your list of alcohol recipes, sometimes you'll get a an actual recipe to read and learn.  I'm starting to get duplicate recipes so I think I may have learned most of them at this point.
---
All amazing stuff, but I absolutely cannot wait for the new dungeon.
---
The prices are fine as they are
---
I have a lovely instigating one fully modded out I've been waiting to use forever so that'll be a nice change of pace
---
I just pulled up Steam to check - I have 1,393 hours logged into Fallout 4 on Steam, with mods.
---
Should I mention that I also own it on XBox and have a bunch of hours there too?  No.  No, I won't say that.
---
At level 156 I could kill 10 people die once or twice, and I have less than I started with. Or I'd get in a 1v4, kill 3, gain like 150 caps, then die by the fourth and lose 350. Was starting feel like there's no reward as a high level.
---
We are not - that was postponed to next month.
---
Thanks! It would be super weird for it to be gone haha I should have taken an up to date video but I’ll be good, I think, maybe
---
this is only a PvP issue and not even really that.. the fact that someone pays for repair kits from the Atom Store doesn't affect PvE at all. It would actually help as less resources are stripped and horded.
---
But what would you do with the big gun I gave you a few days ago? Or the one before that? :P
---
If only I could bet my deleted screenshots back
---
Keep trying you'll eventually get it.  It's an easy quest usually, only have to fast travel to get some rarer ingredients sometimes.  I usually do the first part first thing when I log in, start my alcohol in the fermenter, and then get it out and complete the quest after I'm done with all my other questing for the day.
---
It’ll be great if they add more good areas to farm . White springs will always be populated now
---
It can’t hurt to boost your luck before a cap stash run or some legendary farming with some chems or food, that’s what I do, I don’t know how much it helps but there’s no harm in experimenting and seeing if you feel a difference, happy go lucky perk boosts luck by 3 with alcohol, iguana soup is plus 3, and day tripper is 2 or 3 I think. Xcell is plus 2 to all stats except endurance I think
---
I'm a heavy weapon build an with the right legendaries you can shred through most anything in or out of power armor. Good boy is still a great perk and I use it all the time. Hacking/lock picking  I just switch out perk cards when I need to use them.
---
For regular game play almost all builds are relatively viable, just depends on how you want to play. The hardest part is getting the armor and weapon that fits your build. There are several reddit forums that sell gear it just may take some waiting and caps to get it.
---
Maybe a faction affiliation each guild could pick? Like an analogue for Lyon's Pride could be another named group within the brotherhood. The responders had the firebreathers etc. Have factions but also have guilds because faction based stuff won't really give you a place to build a close social group for the game. Would you really share your hard earned items with any random person thst slapped on a Enclave tag, or would you rather have another system to handle stuff like that?
---
Do you have those same 2 perks? Wasnt sure if they changed them or if it was a dumb idea to even take them in the first place.
---
Nobody is gonna sell em for the same prices after the patch. now that they can easily sell 3 serum's for a total of 1200 caps, instead of selling 10 for 120 caps a piece :)
---
Unbelievably overpowered yet the user has to play at 20% health, yeah I don’t think so. I’ll go down in one shot like you if I’m crouching or moving, or get hit with a vats crit, so the risk fits the reward.
---
Im sure they' re working on something. Just remember that songs cost money.
---
Rarer costume stuff, black titanium ore, and vintage nukashine
---
Same! I’m level 320 something, so every time I died, bye bye 640 caps! Now by my reckoning, it’ll be around 80 - much better!
---
The problem is that it's displaying things off your stash. If you have 10 power armors you want to display, that's 100 weight from your stash. I hope they make some change to this system though.
---
I was thinking this from the beginning. This is a challenge, and this is a "help token".
---
add pychotats recipe back please!
---
&gt; .i have 800 hours have defeated her a ton never got a serum recipe
---
Same.  I have nearly 500 hours, quite a number of SBQ kills, but no serum recipes.  (Barely anything but Prime plans from her).
---
I'm very surprised that they go for so cheap in player trades (1-2k) seems like they'd be more readily dropped.  Or we are just significantly unlucky with our RNG :).
---
Yeah it’s cool as hell. I loved that quest in fallout 4 so I like using it for the nostalgia.  With two shot it’s not half bad
---
Can we get back the BOS combat mod plans and dense plans to vendors next patch pretty please!
---
Some nice things to read in that list though!
---
Well said!
---
He always worked with me but I'm just a real unlikable guy .

---
Are you the same man who does these for destiny releases
---
Survival mode =&gt; 25% x level killed = total caps received (kill level 100 = 25cap reward)
---
Adventure mode =&gt; ? x level killed = total caps received (kill level 100 = ? cap reward)
---
Can someone remind me what the adventure cap percentage was?
---
Can I ask why use it for vendor runs? Any specific reason over adventure mode? Just curios.
---
That's your lose :) Im just hear to inform fellow serum traders &lt;3
---
Yeah best way is to put on can do and run through whitesprings garbage cans. Normally can get a few. I typically wait to get brahmin milk untl i have the canned coffee to avoid spoilage
---
Anything about the repair kits in the cash shop or is that planned or later?  I hope they keep the shop to cosmetic only.
---
Before this patch, he insulted me by standing in vats distance near a scorch beast.
---
Wasn’t a question directed at you was a general question
---
Yeah, the only issue is that her health scales directly off of the level of the player who launched the nuke. So if it was a low level, she might get killed almost instantly, whereas if it's a high level player (not sure if there is a hardcap though), she might still have plenty of health left when the timer expires, even if you have half a server's worth of level 200+ players.
---
So how much exactly the Syringer may or may not have played a part in this is really hard to say. Which is exactly why I'm hoping someone out there might have done some more "clinical" testing.
---
THIS! that was so f-ing annoying!
---
I always found randos that were doing it right, waiting and even using emotes to warn about the legendary mole miner.
---
Honestly this was a good move by Bethesda and I was hoping for this more than anything else. People were making too many caps in survival mode to the point that it’s caused out of control inflation. It’s caused cap prices to skyrocket on the trading boards and has even gotten so bad that most higher level players won’t/can’t even trade in caps because their value has decreased so much and they are already sitting at max caps. It’s made it so that a say lvl 50-70 player has no chance of bartering for a good item at all.
---
Even just having the songs that play on Appalachian radio would be an improvement imo.
---
Is it weaker than the normal Gatling laser? I’ve never found an ultracite one and I’m level 103
---
Short fix check out  “post modern jukebox” pandora station
---
And i didn't say that you shouldn't sell em to players. I only said that the serum value has increased :)
---
Crap loads of plans and recipes.  Ammo.  Some Fashnacht stuff.
---
There is no difference that I can attest to. I have a capped Luck and legendary drops I get are mediocre (very rarely do I get a 3-star). 99% of all my legendary drops are 1-stars.
---
Pure speculation and a good portion of RNG on your side doesn't make it evident.
---
PC, sorry :)
---
Been saying this since day one. It would make owning all sets of power armor. worth it.I don't bother owning the Nuka Cola armor for example  because I won't waste the cores to wear it because it's worse than my X-01 and it takes up space in my stash so why would I get it? IAlso, f we could display power armor, the atom shop might get popular because people may want to buy all the paints to display them.
---
Vats builds are unusable in Power Armor due to fast energy core drain. I want points back for wasting on a vats build I can't even play.
---
Ha. At first I thought you’re so mean it’s only a bit of water. But that made me smile as I can just see his devastated face as he followed you back. Bet he’s hating on you now.
---
25% player lvl caps upon killing another player! That completely eliminates the point of PvP. At least keep it at 100% player lvl...
---
Still no BOS daily quest fix. =(
---
If anything, killing others in Survival was *over-*incentivized, to the point where the mode was simply unappealing to anyone not willing to A: Roll around in god-tier duped gear or B: Lose thousands of Caps and half their Aid.  Which is a pretty wide swath of players, I'd imagine.
---
So pvp farming is getting nerfed due to some people whining great 
---
Heads up then the pvp trolls That you thought were gone are gonna come back since they just lost their main method of cap farming
---
Did you two ever chat in Area Chat? I can see where one or both of you might have been getting a good laugh or five out of it.
---
Yeah, me too, but I recently discovered my CAMP is right next to where a pack of Brahmin always spawn, and was in need of caps. I was curious how much the milk would sell for, and apparently it's nothing. Lol.
---
Basic conduits have a large area of effect for radiating power and are probably the best at it, however they need to be directly linked to your generators to do this. There is an “advanced connectors” set, but it’s more costly to build, kind of a pain to build with, looks just as junky as loose wires and it’s radiators are much weaker. It does have a special piece meant to clip through walls though. 
---
So on to basic wiring. Using the basic conduits you really only need to run power through one line and as long as all the power generated by your generators adds up to be greater or equal to the power used by your connected equipment added up, you’ll have no power issues. You can connect a row of five generators to each other just by linking one to the next then have a single line traveling from the final one to whatever it is you want to power and it will work just fine, so you don’t need five individual lines running to your objects. 
---
Anything that has a connector can also be treated like a conduit that won’t radiate power. If you, for example, build a rocket turret you can directly link it to the next rocket turret in your defense line or to anything else that has a connecter attached. I advise against using defense equipment this way though, and suggest you instead have a separate connector next to them and a complete “loop” that runs around back to your generators, as you really don’t want to lose an entire line of defense because the first turret got targeted. Once it’s broken it severs the link to further connected items until it’s repaired.
---
Some items just need power radiated to them. These are mostly just decorative items, posters, lights, signs etc. All they need to to is be within range of a standard conduit or an advanced radiator and they will siphon power, they won’t take from your power budget so you could theoretically build as many as you like until you run out of camp budget. None of these will have visible connectors on them, as there is no need for them, they will just have a lightning bolt and no number to indicate that they need an insignificant amount of power to run. 
---
Knowing if your conduits are powered. Sometimes you get a little ahead of your self and build a whole power system without actually linking it to your generator, instead of running and checking all of your white connections just look for the green LED light that is on your conduits, if it’s lit the conduit has power and is radiating properly. If it’s out check the the previous one until you find your missing wire. The larger utility pole style connectors also have a bright yellow light that serves the same function. The LED is only on one side, so check both as only one will be lit, I know it’s the downward facing side for the wall mounted conduits, but I can’t remember what side for ceiling and floor conduits. 
---
Getting power through a solid wall. Say you want power inside but your generators are outside, or you want to encase your generators in a locked building because you are tired of supermutants plinking them to death with their god-tier pipe rifles. Well there are several ways to do this. The first is the most obvious, and it is to get the advanced power connectors plan from a vendor and use the wall pass through piece to poke through the wall and connect a power connecter on the inside. But let’s say you don’t have advanced connectors, or you do and the pass through piece isn’t being agreeable (keeps telling me it’s floating or needs connected... gave up on the damn thing since it doesn’t seem to want to work when I want it to, only where I don’t want it) well good news! There’s a second method to getting power through a solid wall. All you have to do is build an open door or window wall tile, and put one connector on both sides and run the wire through the open space, then go into build &gt; edit &gt; scrap/replace and replace the wall with a solid piece, ta-da you now have power going through a wall and way less hairs pulled out! Be warned though, the more you build up a camp the harder it is to move in once piece later.
---
I tried Survival Mode over the weekend, a player snuck up on me but I killed him before he made his first shot and he dropped like 20 stimpaks. Not wanting to risk losing that many items if I got killed, I switched back to Adventure right away. Hopefully the Survival tweaks are enough to make me switch back since I could really use the extra exp.
---
Well, seeing as people were duping and abusing Explosives Bobbleheads to oneshot the Queen, I would not be surprised if an underused item that gets much less attention could potentially work this way. As some effects are stackable and others aren't, it'd be hard to say for sure until someone does some testing.
---
Once I get the chance to find someone willing to help, I hope I can figure it out for sure.
---
No, can can mod a legendary same as any other, you don’t not lose the effects
---
Pew pew pew :)
---
Yeah, I agree with that.
---
I'd like to see the game map evolve over time. Maybe after WS becomes a hub of trade and reclaimed it could change get a bit more fixed up, the ghouls get driven to a nearby place maybe cave system also moving the good farm spot not just eliminating it.
---
Could be done with community goals slowly over time or something fun.
---
counterpoint: Im level 150 and ventured into survival once because the price was too high. Losing 300 caps hurts. With this change, more people will venture into survival mode. You'll also have fewer people thatfeel the need to use their low level character and use their main account, which will mean more people that are 100+. They may have nerfed it a little harder than expected, but levels are only gonna get higher. I think 50 or so caps is a fair number to lose for dying (+junk and aid) and within a month or two, most of the hardcore players will be at lvl 200.
---
I look at it as “If we’re going to have pay to win is there a way to make it more palatable?”
---
The game is not even just pay to win its turning pay to play after you've already paid lol
---
Pure logic
---
This patch looks very nice also new content ! 
---
However when can we expect energy weapons Armor penetration fix and buff to fuel ammo crafting ?
---
The good kews is that today's patch changes it so you only show up on the map for total kills I areas of time survived
---
I dunno, some peeps have 100’s of each, and don’t forget they can only sell a few each day to shops before they hit limit.
---
The rewards for winning a PvP engagement were pretty intense. Nice haul!
---
I ended up losing about 99% of my aid, but I picked up Lead Belly and Cannibal to make it so I didnt need a large amount... The things we will do haha
---
i mean kinda you can only get so many caps from the vendors
---
Id love to use energy weapons but assume that they are still broken and the ammo is costly? What weapon choices would you recommend investing perks into?
---
Since the last patch, I’ve actually had zero problems placing them at the moment
---
Are there NPCs for the new quest line? I stopped playing because the quests all got so drab and boring
---
Neon Letters: Fixed several issues affecting placement of Neon Letters, Numbers, and Symbols
---
Suhweeeeet!
---
It always has issues but i notice i have the worst time right before the updates.
---
There’s been a handful of people like that lately. I had two guys follow me around the map trying to fight me. No clue why as I’m only a level 30. 
---
I ended up logging out because it got so annoying.
---
That's awesome. Basically any container with no weight limit and/or being big and visible near a trader. I've even found a few gems in them myself :D Always nice to see a plan you don't already know in there from time to time.
---
Hey i have 100's aswell. im just sayin that the value has increased. and that players could easily sell em for 200-350 per :)
---
When playing Adventure Mode (so PvE) it's totaly okay. Story involves a lot of reading or listening to holotapes. You might come across places, where you get the next tape and the current one is still playing but because now, players can't kill you, you can wait in peace, till the tape ended, so you can pick up the next one and start playing it. Sure you can pick it up directly but it was for me easier to keep track, which you already listen to.   
---
The stroy leaves a hole at the end and doesn't awnser every question.
---
At some point you might come to a point, where you feel like entering that area is too high level but the other areas are done exploring. With PA you can tank and i rushed the higher areas, missing out on side quests. When done every major thing, it feels like nothing to do but this is with a lot of open world games.   
---
I won't say its the best FO Game but you can enjoy it and stuff will be added later. So you can stop playing and come back later, to do the new quests, like now with the new Quests.
---
How does everyone else get caps? I just sell my shit to vendors. Ive not seen a real good way of getting caps elsewise
---
/u/Valseek /u/Ladydevann /u/BethesdaGameStudios_
---
Like with every patch, I don't see any update on when we can see Daily: Heart of the Enemy being fixed. Can we get an update? Still experiencing this since launch.
---
Here is the info on the bug, which can be found in a previously submitted ticket (which I have attached below).
---
Platform: PC
---
Ticket ID: 181207-001720
---
Problem: 
---
* Heart of the Enemy quest shows in the completed section and not active in my quest list, but cannot start the quest upon reading the Mission Orders.
---
How long has this issue occurred: 
---
* 120+ Days. I have only been able to start/complete this quest on two attempts within the first few days of launch. This issue has persisted through multiple days/logouts/patches/server restarts.
---
Steps Performed: 
---
* Read Senior Knight Wilson's terminal (may not be required as the quest starts with the Mission Orders). 
---
* Read note "Mission 099-01 Orders" at Fort Defiance, but unable to pick it up. Quest does not start. 
---
* Went to Vault-Tec University, accessed the terminal which shows that I know the password. This indicates the quest is currently active. 
---
* Terminal and Analyzer show that they is waiting for a viable scorchbeast sample to process. 
---
* There are no quest markers on the map, and no scorchbeasts are marked for extraction.
---
Needed Resolution: Need an option to again start Daily: Heart of the Enemy, or to forget/remove the previously completed quest.
---
Video Confirmation of Bugged Quest: https://youtu.be/1CDkJ7hX-1M

If you read the patch notes about the Burrows, it doesn’t say anywhere to have your gear “topped” up. What it does say is “make sure your gear is up to snuff” which usually means make sure you have good gear for a high level area.  It’s pretty much saying if you are a low level character, stay away until you have high level gear.
---
Add explosive vents
---
Realistically, I would assume that it cuts the 25% off of her current damage resistance, and that that number stays the same as more people approach and her resistances increase, until it is reapplied. If I can find more people to do some testing with, I would really love to figure these things out!
---
There is no mention of repair kits in the patch notes that I saw.
---
Almost 0 toxicity. This game has one of the best palyer bases in the whole gaming community, mostly because the actual toxic playerd are whining on No Mutants Allowed and playing New Vegas with nude mods.
---
The story is good but not mind blowing or anything. The story is subtly spread out all over the map. It will not be shoved into your face or expositioned by a 20 minute cutscene. You need to look for the story, which hoes well with the exploration theme.
---
The map is beautiful and large and varied. People generally have a blast with exploration. 
---
Overall experience is pretty good now. Lots of bugs have been sqaushed out. Tonnes of quality of life changes. Essentially PvP and PvE modes are now separated. Also, I was very much against meeting other people in my game but now it's my favourite thing to find and chat with people in game, or help low levels. The social experience in Fallout is something I never knew I'd want but I love it anyway.
---
Still no BoS combat armor plan fix? Really hoping it would be in this one. Wasn’t fortunate enough to have grabbed it before the bug
---
I've had letters drop off workshops several times.
---
I can see that. On the other hand in the apocalypse folks would strip and horde resources. ;)
---
OMG these are amazing updates, vats, fixed cap stash bugs, the improved vendors, reduced pvp cap loss in survival, new quests, item naming and more! Tytyty
---
Agreed, factions and sub-factions/clans/guilds so that the system cannot be exploited in any way
---
Charisma and Luck do not affect legendary spawns.
---
Technically, having more dps = more legendary spawns, as killing 10 in 30 minutes is faster than doing math for an hour and killing 0.
---
Mine is essentially a small settlement built into a monorail tower, so yeah you're not wrong
---
We'll find out xD. I'm happy about it though, other players couldn't hear it before so getting the increased sound for it will be nice. Be funny if people could hear it for a few miles away or so, just echoing into the distance xD.
---
Ah, a classic.
---
Wow thanks! Would give gold but im poor :(
---
Yes! I want to set the world on fire. I was sad my Perfect Storm was low level when I got it and I haven't been able to find a similar replacement.
---
It would be super cool if we could interface with Spotify so it was personalized! A girl can dream...
---
I'd like to see all the vendor lists get a once-over.  With so many potential combinations of weapon+mod and armor+mod, it seems insufficient to only have a couple random combinations per vendor.  And yet, we get goofy things like Chainsaw mods and Paddle Ball String that appear all the time.
---
I understand your point, but we both know at the end of the day, traders undercut each other, just simple business, the guy who offers them cheaper will get the caps, I personally don’t think there’ll be any difference in price, maybe a slight increase, who knows though.
---
I think it'd be better to sell hats to the vendors for cap, then continue to sell serums for 200.
---
You could sell a handful of serums to vendors, but why, we have hats.
---
Ah I appreciate it so much thankyou! :)
---
Yea at the end of the day, it’s a bin that gets emptied and fulled all the time when in need of mass crafting ammo, xp soups, chems, grenades or even for items that need repairing
---
In Camp Venture yes, not in Fort Defiance to make it clear
---
I got you!
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5hrHjCk5RTycypyr3ub4aQ/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-notes-april-9-2019
---
No, I actually don't know if it works whatsoever. I mostly oneshot things, and I haven't done any extensive testing. I wanted to save that until I had checked if anyone else had, or could refer me to someone who had.
---
I hope it does work though, and that we potentially get similar weapons or more options for barrels down the line. Such effects could change how different builds would approach different combat situations quite a bit if implemented properly and functioning well.
---
Should also increase the value of serum recipes
---
This is literally what I came back for; only to learn they’re more concerned with how loud an alp horn is and whether or not a random encounter can actually insult you..
---
Let’s hope there’s a mod that changes Insult Bot’s script to take digs at Bethesda
---
Why didn’t you check your weapons before heading in? Not tying to be an ass just wondering if it was super long or? Like every time i go to do a queen I’m making soup, grabbing some cryo cells out of bank and check my weapons and armor. Takes less then 3 mins!
---
Good job, Bethesda! Now lets hope this patch doesn't bring old issues.
---
Troubleshooters .50 cal for cargobot.
---
The 200 price point won't change. I could only sell 3 a day to the Bots, when its cheaper in mats to sell other items. Plus helping the community is a better feeling that hoarding all the caps to no real end for having so many.
---
Why not add a delay for them to reburrow like SB's screams?
---
It's a beta, so it looks like to me they're  trying the other extreme. I wouldn't be surprised if they brought the cap rewards back up, just not as high as 2x your level (which would've been fine had it capped at lv 50).
---
Very true
---
They broke it once, then fixed it, then broke it again during a roll back.  Never fixed it since
---
Already featured that on one of the prior lists :)
---
So you spend 100 caps to craft each, make 3 and sell them for 1200 and make 900 profit. Meanwhile it cost me like 10 caps to print 1400 worth of hats.
---
Just be aware of your rad damage from eating corpses. I hadnt used Cannibal before, but lead belly eliminates that issue. :) Happy hunting!
---
I had someone keep trying to kill me the other day, at first i wouldn't engage but it got annoying while i was trying to base build. Anyway he was next to a bed i had built and must have accidentally clicked it, went into the lying down animation, so I put down about 6 turrets shot him in the head and left the room.
---
This would be AMAZINGGG.
---
Quad barrel middle launcher with targeting computer and .50 cal work good enough for scorch beasts
---
Heck no.
---
The addition of Survival mode plus the additional changes coming up actually make me a very happy adventure mode player. 
---
PVP is not my thing in the slightest.
---
Insightful thoughts presented here - even Scorched Earth doesn't really require repair kits today.  Make repair kits and make a reason to use them - its a perfect marriage of elements for monetization.
---
But not his shop.
---
Update: From Patch 8 Notes:
---
 **Social:** On consoles, the “Make a Friend” Challenge now correctly completes after successfully adding a friend.
---
If you killed you him would you get a 3* legendary?
---
YUPPP
---
As a melee main, i found a Furious/Reload speed/+ Agi handmade like a month ago. No perks in it, and it still shreds most flappers until they land.
---
No.
---
the post was mainly targeting fellow players with a large quantity of serum's :) 100+
---
But i get your point
---
Reminds me of college. The guy down the street from me would announce he was throwing a kegger by stepping out on his porch in the evening, yelling "Beer here!" at the top of his lungs, and blowing this loud horn he had. I miss those days, lol.
---
Sneak
---
Best fix ever. 👍🏻
---
For the Cargobots, I use a Quad Combat Shotgun with Rank 3 Enforcer to destroy the engines and make it stop moving, and then finish it off with a Bloodied Gatling Gun.
---
For Scorchbeasts, I use the shotgun to cripple their wings... although that's often not necessary because they seem better about coming down on their own these days.
---
I basically modded my shotgun to be like the one from Doom.  You wouldn't think of a shotgun as being a long-range weapon, but with Enforcer, damage is beside the point.  You want to simply hit the limbs and let the cripple chance happen.
---
you technically don't have to kill any turrets, but you can either vats or jump + melee them while facing them.
---
You can be like everyone else and go melee or you can stand out from the crowd and go Gunslinger!
---
I hope to feel insulted now
---
Because more people are affected by the loss than by the gain.  People who have been playing since Beta don't want to lose 300-600 caps just for 20% more xp.  If I'm being honest I love the cap adjustment but hate the aid.  I was really fond of loading up on dirty water and spoiled food so it would take from that and not my stimpacks.
---
no it wasn't ..there never was a concrete date fro the decorating
---
Energy got a damage boost update but have not played with it to know if it is worth it. My alternative guns are the handmade and lever action rifle. Anti armor, furious, two shot, explosive  are all great perks imo.
---
You can block for session. It's very useful
---
Where does one get a middle launcher from? Also how does one launch middles? Do you have to be in the middle?
---
How I picture the news screen...
---

---
Thank fuck for the drop in kill caps on death in survival. ..sick of losing over 400 caps per death.
---
Which hats are you talking about? 👀
---
I’m curious if this is going to apply to survival considering when you have your gun out you go red and not yellow. 
---
I’ve only got to skim the patch notes so far so forgive me if I’m wrong.
---
Batteries included helps a LOT with fusion core weight. Not absolutely necessary but yeah. Its easy to have a positive number of FC's at any given time, as long as you aren't a vats build (those should be outside of PA) or jetpacking everywhere all the time... or gatling laser'ing everything. For high FC use, just take over power plants and power up those FC processors, collect every 20 minutes.
---
I believe i have multiple of every plan :)
---
Community mod. But the mod literally just made them buildable in bases. The model and object already existed in game, specifically in Greygarden. The ease of adding them to the build menu and how popular those mods were should have been a clue to the fo76 team.
---
I use  a Vampires 50 Cal for Scorchbeasts. Only because it also gives me +1 Perception and +50% Limb damage. 
---
The limb damage is the important part.
---
It was 1:1 so level 100 gives 100 caps so... not sure what their plans are here. I guess it makes sense to keep it at 1:1 since you now pretty much have to agree to PvP before you start (with the exception of workshops) so there's more of a stated intent that you're OK losing caps.
---
Complaining about Assassin's/Sentinel tells me you have no idea how PVP works in **this** game. One stagger and it's over, especially if they're bloody. This isn't CoD, you have to adapt to the different builds and play styles. There's a counter to everything. 
---
The only real OP thing at the moment is stealth boy spammers/chameleon glitch users. Staggering them is tougher but even they die eventually.
---
It's really just Good Doggy.  That's all you need.  I use to have Good Doggy and Slow Metabolizer, but Good Doggy on its own can refill about 50% of my food bar.  I got mine in a card pack.
---
Where do you hear the music? I've never heard random music in Harpers Ferry.
---
Lucky! I've been looking for one for months. I really don't want to level up an alt to lvl 50 just to get that one weapon. If you are on PC and ever decide to sell it, you have a buyer. I was lucky enough to buy a max level Somerset Special at a vendor and it's my go-to weapon for lower level areas to burn all the .44 I pick up. I can one-shot anything in the forest.
---
One of the community managers said that camp decorating will come along with player vending.
---
That was before it was pushed back tho
---
Oh ok i always thought they where going to put it with player vending because of how they put it with player vending on the map.
---
My main has the chem reduce perk by default, and I barely notice them.
---
My fresh leveled alt does not, and I discovered that my Aid items were more than half my carry weight, even after I reduced to what I considered reasonable.
---
The Enclave didn't even include all the federal high ups, the secretary of defense for example doesnt seem to have been included, nor the speaker. The Vice President was but it seems he didnt make it.

I can launch a nuke solo and then do the nuke zone usually without my main weapon or armour dropping beneath 100%, so i'm not overly worried. Reapairing stuff to 200% and using degredation prevention perk cards (Like Makeshift warrior) makes it mostly a non issue (For me at least)
---
Where people not getting insulted by him? The only time I ran into him, he did say something mean to me. I got the note from him also, but it was blank.
---
It's there like the rest of them. Not the most common one, but there. Did two events yesterday.
---
I have also experienced this as well, playing with 32 charisma. 3* enemies seem to drop 3* legendaries much more often when I’m running this character versus any of my other characters that have 1-2 charisma.
---
log in and decide for yourself.
---
hope you read this, Bethesda admitted to day int eh patch notes that they DID need to adjust the rate at which food spoils, proving there WAS an issue

If the Vendor Fix included some of the Plans being back, I'd be soooo happy
---
Also, WTB Plan: Deep Pocketed Combat Armor Limbs (xb1)
---
\^\^
---
Civil war top hats, theres a reason the plans cost 6-7k because they are rare and a gold mine :)
---
1 cloth = 1 hat and they sell about 40 a piece with the bargin perk and decent charisma.
---
Yeah this is a huge game changer for me, I’m super excited to keep playing survival now!
---
All I know is that my shotgun’s name will be “BOOFBOOF”
---
Be sure to check non-legendary ghouls as well. I've been getting legendary items from them lately, usually on runs where it \*looks\* like I find no legendaries.
---
I havent had issues with this, you just have to be careful how you place them.
---
Boofboof is a good boy
---
That happened to me a few times too. But in most cases there’s nothing period, even long after they turned into meat or metal piles.

I'm with the Hound on this one.
---
Outside the alley, with the chem bench behind the vendor there is a house next to the cliffside just in front of that house, as if from under the ground, patriotic flute music can be heard.
---
i did get a 3 star item ..i mean it wasnt guaranteed to be 3 star
---
\*\*hic\*\*  I ushly just take a beer shauer!  \*\*hic\*\*
---
Time to bring that to West Virginia XD. It would be funny if we could name our player vending machines next month. On the map is just a marker called "Beer here!" xD.
---
This is an official CM posting the notes here.
---
Train station vendors are notorious in Survival mode for spawn camping.  Probably less of an issue after the update, as I'll be able to just hit an out of the way Vendor and clean up.
---
In regards to Swarm of Suitors, will we start being rewarded for completing that event? I've only ever gotten the picture animation and "complete" no caps, no xp, no rewards.
---
My handmade always does me good for aerial targets and PVP.
---
I might have liked if the dungeon was punishing enough that you'd be forced to take multiple weapons to make it through, but now if it is like that it will just seem like a cheap way to make you buy repair kits.
---
I will call them, 1, 2 3, and 4 so they are always at the top of my inventory
---
Oh damn that's awesome I never knew that. Do you know where I can buy plan from?
---
I have an X-01 suit with woodland camo, a stealth boy mod, and red headlights... I call it the Predator suit (Alien vs Predator)
---
&gt;Weapons: Charged weapons, such as the Salvaged Assaultron Head, now correctly deal increased damage in proportion to the number of times they have been charged
---
Finally, I'm really excited to try this out.
---
The first time they "broke" bulk it actually broke the opposite way.  Bulk items were not consumed when crafting/repairing.  The "Fix" for that break is what we have now.  Bulk will be consumed with Craft/Repair.  But is also consumed by Scrap All Junk.
---
Before Patch:
---
Mods were consumed by Crafting/Repairing (Not Desired)
---
After Patch:
---
Mods were not consumed by Crafting/Repairing (Desired).  Bulk was not either.  (Not Desired)
---
After Hotfix:
---
Mods are not consumed by Crafting/Repairing (Desired).  Bulk is consumed by Crafting/Repairing (Desired).  Bulk is also consumed by Scrap All Junk (Not Desired).
---
And that is where it has sat since the patch and hotfix following.  Scrap All Junk is consuming Bulk, as a side effect of it being consumed with Crafting/Repairing, and it won't be fixed until Beth makes a change they said was significant to the item classification of Bulk.
---
&gt; **Compass:** While wearing Power Armor, Map and Quest markers no longer appear misaligned from their actual locations in the Compass. 
---
BEST PATCH EVER
---
What is the alpine horn??
---
We get a new update that adds a few quests and enemy into the game so coming back now would be a good time.  And get to level 50+, melee weapons aren't more "superior" than guns you're just super underleveled lol.
---
Fantastic idea. So Fucking whiney about a game you got caught cheating while playing.
---
Check this out for reference:

While I understand the problems associated with Bethesda going back on their promise to keep the Atom shop cosmetic-only, I think there's also a need for a bit of realism here. Fallout 76 is an MMO, and that involves a huge maintenance cost compared to something that isn't online (FO4, Skyrim, etc). So, to the people saying "I paid $50 so everything should be free", you simply cannot have that - it's not possible.
---
An alternative would be to have a subscription fee. Sure, I'm guessing quite a few people would be alright with that given the success of WoW, but Bethesda would still receive a ton of backlash for that. A third option? Paid DLC and content paywalls. Again, a historically successful (and unpopular) pricing model, and people would still complain until the cows come home.
---
I get that people are concerned that paid convenience items are a slippery slope. But Guild Wars 2 has done that and it works great, in my opinion! It's definitely not Pay2Win, I don't have to pay a subscription so I'm not tied into playing X hours a month to make it worth it, and those with deep pockets splurge out on convenience/cosmetics thus indirectly paying for my non-existent subscription.
---
My guess on why Bethesda has done this is that the predicted income from cosmetics wasn't as much as it needed to be to maintain the game *and* bring in profit. Unsurprising, really. There's a lot of great outfits which you can find in the wild (a kind act, in my opinion), so there's less need to spend real-world cash on them. In addition, I can get a PA skin, some C.A.M.P decorations and an outfit or two just from the Atoms I've earned while playing, and that's already more than I'd usually purchase. So they need a better income stream. Cosmetics won't do it and they definitely don't want to start introducing subscription fees and paid DLC, so this seems like a reasonable compromise which impacts everyone the least on average.
---
Sorry for the text wall, but I've moved to FO76 from other MMOs and I don't think people realise how much content they're getting with this game (compared to other MMOs) without having to spend an additional cent on top of the base price. 
---
Tl;dr the money needs to come from somewhere - convenience items, subscription or content paywall. "I paid $50 for this game" isn't a valid argument for MMOs.
---
Renaming Stuff is one thing that i wanted. Now i can have multiply PA Sets and know which one is which. Beeing able to display them, also would be great.   
---
Now I wan't to display PA, Boobleheads, Magazines, Weapons and Armor in my Camp.
---
You mean like the raids they intentionally didn't put in the game? Sure, let's do that.
---
&gt;Weapons: The Salvaged Assaultron Head no longer fires all Fusion Cells in a player’s inventory on the first shot.
---
Finally I'm ready to try this out
---
I'm super original, and mine will be named:
---
Excavator 
---
Raider 
---
Ultracite 
---
X-01
---
T60
---
etc...
---
I don't know what I expected.
---
So far but remember white knight was stronger before hopefully they don’t go breaking intentionally things
---
Or they are the hero we need, keeping order. Whichever way you wanna look at it I guess haha :P. Srs though people are like that; 1 cap is a good enough reason.
---
You've obviously done your research.  Thanks for the insight.
---
They are going to be put in the game whether you're thinking of the dungeons or vault raids, both are coming in the future
---
I like VATS specifically for situations like this.
---
Now with them changing it to displaying markers for the top 3 kill count insead of longest life and cutting the caps from 200% level to 25% level it's going to really mix up how this mode is played. If they make it total kills (and not "kills this life") there will be no more death tower camps, no more suicide pacts. People will be less likely to bother with low level people or people they know are caps dry because it won't be worth hitting the top 3 kill count.
---
Sure, `zzz_excavator`, so it doesn't show up in the middle of the transfer/craft/scrap window.
---
They have multiple tones, so on my mountaintop bar I have 4 arranged in a row side by side so you can hit them all and get them all going at once....sounds great with the nice view from the patio.
---
However, unless they've changed it, they were only sounding for the person who activated it. I had a number of players come by the bar (not an easy one to reach) and whenever someone activated the horns, no one else could hear them...hopefully that's been fixed as it would be great to hear them blasting out from the mountain.
---
200% to 25% seems like a huge nerf, but a big complaint was how many caps people were losing when a higher level.
---
Was thinking the same thing. I can't wait until I get off of work!
---
Played Beta, melee weapons were stronger than TSE pre nerf?
---
Just searching for them in containers or on bodies. I never really sell anything
---
Um...reddit much? You DO know that complaining about downvotes is like a mating call for more downvotes, right? Don't let them see you get triggered like that. It Doesn't end well.
---
But you are the one losing in the end, by wasting things with real cap value on the 1400 caps available for all the Worthless Garbage you should be selling to Vendors.
---
Don't be blinded by that big value number on the item.  You have to look at the larger picture and realize that the abundant but truly worthless items in the game you collect should be used to consume that 1400 daily allotment of Caps, and the things with real value used to score more Caps from players.
---
omg yes! my alt is a vats-crit-sniper.....i swear gun-fu WANTS me to get a bounty (or kill the turret im protecting, etc)...thank god this is in here
---
I rather pay atom to chance my paper bag to a vault tec lunch box.
---
r/whoosh
---
But how am I going to get angry and confused when I pull out 1 but wanted 3, and then find out that I name what I wanted to be 4 2, and then when I change it, I keep screwing up because I was used to 4 as 2, and the come to reddit to bitch about it?
---
Don’t worry, you can now buy repair kits for real money!  WTG Bethesda, giving us what matters!
---
True endgame players won’t need repair kits, shoooot if my 200% repaired Tse handmade breaks I’ll just switch to my 200% repaired AA handmade and if that breaks I’ll switch to my 200% repaired instigating lever action and if that breaks I’ll switch to my 200% repaired AA pipe rifle and if that doesn’t work I’ll switch to my 200% repaired bloodied radium rifle or 200% repaired bloodied dragon and if that breaks...
---
Lol get my point? I’m only level 129 and have 23 legendary rifles and pistols that my min maxed build can use it to one hit about 90% of the games enemies
---
Yeah i wish 3* enemy meant 3* drop
---
Super interested to see how strong turrets will be now hahaha
---
My Excavator with Calibrated Shocks will be named "Uber"
---
I just hope it's not like a lvl 25 or 35 quest and then be extremely easy and only 20 mins long..... the Fuaschtnaut event was a joke..... (at least for players 40+
---
I barely even use Reddit, I don't even understand how this rating system works. If they get triggered so easily, then they shouldn't even be on the internet. Children these days.  
---
Thanks for the heads up though, but I've heard so much negativity about people on Reddit, and so much.
---
I think the drops are supposed to be better (repair to 150% vs 100% for paid) which tells me that BGS knows that they’re stepping all over previous statements.
---
Ah gotcha, I thought you meant there was an actual benefit to doing it in survival mode.
---
Ouch! Getting shot in the face in the furor of pew-pew is not fun. 
---
Happier days indeed!
---
Ok this isn't even a suggestion this is just your idea of a perfect game for you isn't it?
---
interesting..... this is my survival build as well and am curious about this too
---
If you're on PC, there is a mod, https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/258
---
But it's a dynamic object so if anything like an explosion happens, say goodbye to your goodies.
---
I use: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/270 as it's a static object just like the bag.
---
Should’ve just been your level, or 75%
---
Noob
---
Knowledge is power!
---
Apparently their server clock needs some readjustment...

---
Ohhh, thats a good point, changing the name of crap to "Trash" or even putting what I want the price to be in the name when I sell it to another player ...
---
\&gt;  
---
* A Vendor from each faction except the Enclave can now be found downstairs in the shops at The Whitespring Resort.
---
* This should help reduce the need to Fast Travel in order to visit multiple Vendor Factions when buying and selling items.
---
Hmm, Not sure I like this. If this means that get access to Free States Vendor, without ever going to Harpers Ferry, then I don't like it. If however, they only become available to someone *AFTER* that vendor has been discovered then I'm all for it and think it is a massive QoL improvement.
---
I used to have a base that was way too high up for you to even attempt to “walk in” and I know of the glitch where things don’t load, I’ve also seen stair-less fortresses in other places where you literally cannot physically get to. My pc account has one, but it was just one I was testing the glitch with so it’s not in a location I can guarantee safety in. But so far no one can kill him in it.
---
Yup. No guessing game now. Going to save a lot of time this way.
---
Because now any adjustment to junk, condition, or durability is now tainted since it will no longer be a game play or balance decision, but a revenue decision. 
---
Once atom purchasable repair kits are a thing, any change to weapon durability or how much junk you get when scrapping will prompt the question "Was this adjusted due to balance in game, or because the Shop was missing revenue targets.
---
Someone else commented that fo76 is pay to win, with people selling items (legitimately acquired or not) on marketplaces and eBay. That is true, I hate it, and wish it was possible to eliminate it entirely but I thought that when I played Everquest 1.  The difference is that those marketplaces won't be adjusting game mechanics.
---
Yes, I understand that they exist to make profit and therefore have no problems with all the cosmetics micro transactions they can cram in. I just want game designers to design my games, not accountants.
---
Wanna trade? l I have like 300 screws on me now and like 15 springs lol
---
\^Deep Pocketed Mod still missing from Vendors too
---
Preach on Brother, we'll get it back
---
Not consistently....sometimes he would target somebody, but not insult them. He'd then be stuck in a loop of "get out of my way" and "come back here"
---
I salute you lmaoo
---
wait, no "your base cannot be destroyed while you are in passive mode" for adventure mode with this update?
---
or did i just miss it in there?
---
A new vegas style casino with slots and maybe a lottery you can play alone, as well as dice and card tables to compete with players
---
The one time I ran into the only thing he said was "wait" over and over.
---
No, you're fucking whining and worse you're trying to stir up shit that is already well stirred at this point. As easily as you can bitch that this content is going to require repair kits I can just as easily suggest that even IF you were killing enough shit in this dungeon for your weapons to degrade that much then there could just as easily be fucking repair benches inside.
---
Only benefit that I could see is that SBQ and Whitespring runs are still going to be more common on adventure.  I've occasionally found some pretty decent legendaries on the vendors in Watoga and white springs.
---
Can you add my bugged quest issue to this list?
---
-----------------------------
---
I’m going to switch to survival now lol
---
and finally Survival became playable
---
Hi hi can i get them?
---
Does VATS use drain a ton of fusion core power? I almost exclusively use VATS for sneak attack/critical hit combos. If that is the case, I will probably stick to non-PA in any arra that isn't a nuke zone
---
Maestro slugger and rifle man
---
Yes, that is obvious.  But is it really necessary?  With the new 1400 limit we can get our 1400 caps a day in one stop at one vendor anywhere on the map anyway.  Making the factions share cap pool removes 99% of the reason for this.  I agree with this change very much...but not that every faction is in whitespring.  Travelling all around the map daily was extremely annoying.
---
There was already wide selection at whitespring.
---
If you really wanted something only bos sell was it really that hard to go to watoga?  Very small annoyance at most.
---
  Yes it's more.convenient, but some minor inconveniencesare part of life and can make things interesting.  Like a particular plan being for sale only at one vendor.  As to doing things just for convenience and to make things easier, if you are going to go that way, why not make every vendor sell every item...sarcasm.
---
A little off topic. . . But a guy paid me 8k for that plan last night. On PS4. 1st time I've ever had this problem, but I had to make myself spend 7k caps just to make room. It seems much harder to spend when you have to. Those caps drain like water when I'm not trying to spend em, lol.
---
i could buy the gauss rifle and the super sledge, on xbox
---
No one should be safe.
---
Do you have a master list of bugs you're tracking? There are still some old bugs that aren't on this list.
---
My apologies lymmea. Rereading my post, it does come off as unduly harsh on people who put money into microtransactions, and has an implicit value judgement in using the word, 'poor,' when talking about impulse control. I appreciate you making note of it, and taking the time to explain your own situation.  
---
What I was trying to lay out by talking about whales was that these games are essentially subsidized by a proportionally small group of wealthy players, and that there's very little incentive for developers and publishers to cater to other groups.
---
Yes! I kept walking around that junction the other day trying to find it, but it just seemed to come from the centre of the junction. So I guess you're right, it must be under the road!
---
Events still not recording as completed in the pip boy as with some daily’s and side missions
---
Yes.  They are really painful to get.  I've done close to 100 and still no suppressor mod.
---
Minus flamethrowers, Heavy EW are super worth it (cryolater vs queen, gatling plasma/laser for everything else). Regular energy weapons are just OK, not amazing but not unusable by any means.
---
FINALLY! He always came when i grinded tea time
---
Yay now my VAT won’t target a white springs worker, and cause all hell to break loose ;) haha
---
Hunt down the marine mask recipe , cant remember the exact name. The one that looks like a big visor on it. It take like 2 rubber and 1 glass to craft, and maybe a plastic. (Been a minth since i played) I sell them for 30 caps. 
---
Port around and farm glass and rubber if needed. There are afew spots to get a ton fast. 
---
Then port to all vendors and sell them. 
---
Use duper to get extras when you craft. 
---
Ive done this since i got the recipe and am always maxed on caps. Its 1300 a day after port fees. Do this everyday and soon you will be rich biaaatch!!
---
Twitter is much worse. This is one of the more tame and kinder subs on Reddit. The ugly side is really any sub about politics.
---
Meh....while in survival i'm about surviving, not taking somebody elses aid items. I have (and will) shoot on sight out of sheer anxiety that they want to kill me first anyhow.
---
Yea direct benefits would be nice, tbh I disagree im running a level 200 on survival servers and it puts pressure on me to play better and cautiously, its also very rewarding when you kill somone, now you get chump change
---
But once assigned, you can still use it for PTT while playing with a controller. Well, as long as you are in range of your keyboard.
---
Fasnacht was great fun (level 120+).
---
A lot of the radium mods have an extremely low learn rate.
---
armour piercing is the key. 308 or 50cal sniper - all 9 rifle perks and tank killer - ALL rifles armour piercing. I can take out a scorchbeast at sunrise field,form the top of wotoga high school. nearer in- same,  pick your shot until it lands,then hammer it with something else. a combat rifle - any thing with a high rate of fire, or club it with all rise.
---
non armour peircing weapons - run away  - run away
---
Nice fixes and updates but I still want a growing station!
---
Seems to be every single night I play.
---
I hate it though cause it always drops things just one level tier below max...  level 40 items, level 35, etc...
---
Oh, a 3* Instigating Super Sledge!  Awww... level 40...
---
honestly the bad reputation is overblown by peole who think it's the cool thing to hate right now. yes, the game has problems (dear god, does it have problems), but it isn't a broken mess and has improved in quality greatly. I also don't think nylon bags or shitty wine should be used to say the game is bad when those are clearly problems with the COMPANY, not the actual PRODUCT.
---
much like other fallout games, there IS a story. it's just mainly told via holotapes, terminal entries, and notes. many complein there's no story because they're the "shoot, run to objective, push the button, leave for next objective" players. i have found many great stories in the game just by being patient and exploring. sure, the main quest is lacking, but tbh the main quests of 3, New Vegas, and 4 weren't exactly selling points either.
---
the map is 4 times as big as Fallout 4's, but it also has about the same amount of stuff in it, making it feel somewhat empty. but if you enjoy exploring, then finding those unmarked locations is that much more rewarding.
---
i play a few times a week. sometimes with friends, but mostly by myself. even when i'm alone, i tend to meet really nice people (just added two to my friend's list the other day cuz they liked my camp). and if you really just wanna hunt down and kill other players, there's survival mode, where the top 3 longest survivors are pointed out on the map so you can kill them for rewards. i won't lie, there ARE greifers. had some asshole level my camp because i refused to fight back (initiating fair PVP play instead of him becoming a "murderer") in adventure mode. which, he then had a bounty anyway, so idk why he didn't just kill me and be done with it. but those players are few and far between, especially lately.
---
the game has something for everyone, maybe that something isn't done WELL, but they're trying to make it better. you just gotta find what you like about the game and focus on that. for example, my friend likes crafting, so she built a goddamn CASTLE and offers to make weapons and armor for her friends. i, meanwhile, turned my personal camp into a public rest stop, and let anyone who comes by use my workshops, sleep in a bed, get some clean water, the works. i go do repeatable daily quests and events to get caps and supplies, and stock up on things i want to sell when player vending machines finally get implemented. when i get home today, i plan to tackle the new quest that was just added. 
---
i say give the game a try and see for yourself if you like it.
---
Yeah, server hopping just got old fast. Maybe it'll pop up tonight for me.
---
yeah sadly.
---
Makes me miss Christmas
---
Mate, I’m really sorry, I just realised I mis-read your original post, I read it as though you were using Survival for vendor runs lol! I thought to myself “that crazy bastard!”, thought there was a secret benefit to doing vendor runs in survival haha! I get you now though!
---
 **Shop:** On PC, only the “Enter” key can be used to confirm a purchase in the Atomic Shop. 
---
finally, I lost 700 atoms because of this
---
and i want them back lol
---
Yeah think changing the top 3 alone is worth the whole 2gb patch (on PC).
---
Message me on Xbox with an offer.
---
I use my Nokia N-Gage. Get on my level, pal.
---
8K ...
---
Sheesh ... don't spread that info around ... not paying more than 2k ;)
---
It’s worked for me?
---
sounds like a thing they could even sell in the shop for atoms without angering up the blood
---
Lol no worries!  Also the fact that you were wrong does not negate me being a crazy bastard ;)
---
If you're on PS4 I can hook you up with a max lvl
---
Just play for yourself
---
Ouch
---
First time I came across the insult bot he trolled me. He did warn me to stop though so it's my fault for not listening. I just had to find out where he went.
---

---
BTW, that area was patched a few weeks later.
---
I threw on my headset and was turning left and right, jumping up, crouching down, I blew up the nearby cars thinking one of them was playing it.
---
My only conclusion was it was loudest in the middle of the junction nearest the large house and loudest closest to the ground.
---
Why do mole rats even have a level? Why do they even exist. I hope they get removed. Most annoying enemy ever
---
Yes. Get ready to make hundreds upon hundreds of them to fill out your mod list. The lever action was bad, but not radium rifle bad haha.
---
Credit where it's due, these are some fantastic improvements, bug fixes and QoL tweaks...    
---
Didn’t know. But that said you havent missed much :)
---
Fixed client hitching, you say? Oh please be the hitching that has plagued Creation engine games for so long now. If it is, THAT is THE ONLY HIGHLIGHT.
---
MODUS didnt really turn evil, the president was captured by hostiles and he was damaged severely by those same mutineers, resulting in erratic behaviour.  
---
It then retaliated and caused an explosion in the weapons lab, accidentally releasing a  toxin and acting on other (still intact programming) to prevent contamination of the exterior, sealed the bunker.  
---
Everyone eventually suffocated in the quarantine and the toxins.  
---
It then cleaned up the bunker and tarted trying to repair parts whilst it also restored part of the functionality it lost.  
---
MODUS isnt really evil or had designs on supplanting its human superiors. Shit just ensued.  
---
I do hope (but doubt) some of those collapsed areas are restored at one point to explore.
---
I’ll take the hunting rifle for 100000000 please
---
Yes, more love for the psychotats!
---
Just to put an number on the almost 0 toxicity, I've played around 600 hours and have 1 "toxic" experience. To contrast,  I played Rust and those numbers reversed :)
---
Why do I have to destroy the mod when I'm crafting a different mod?  Why cant I just take off the old mod put in my inv and then place the new one?  Seriously theres market to have other players mod other players equipment but I dont trust to give anyone my tse gauss no matter what.
---
Not everyone is so high level and not everyone min maxes their build.
---
what?
---
Doubt it since that's an core aspect of an mmo. One that's more important then camping or those events even imo.
---
If it was intendet to have raids, we would've gotten some on release or anything like that mentioned in the roadmap allready so yeah. It's quite unlikely that they'll EVER turn this game into a propper mmo.
---
The game is great, just don't treat it like a fallout 5 replacement because it isn't and never will be. I hope Bethesda make a sequel to 76 that's multiplayer
---
Lol, sorry. I had it listed at 150caps, so I wasn't trying to make bank. But I'm not gonna say no, lol. When I run a shop listing I generally keep my mods/plans prices pretty reasonable. Sometimes too much so. But I'm fine with that. Like finding a diamond in the rough for someone who needs it.
---
Would you gents kindly post the notes on here? Or link them? At work :3
---
TI-85 user here. Get with it or get lost
---
If you think you're going to have to buy repair kits to keep up with other people buying them, I don't know what else to say...................
---
Doesn't look like we can display things in our camp yet???
---
Backfired on me. Too trigger happy!
---
\&gt; , im assuming its still 100% necessary for end game. 
---
\&gt; may have to do a lot of content solo :(. 
---
Not at all. You can spam the +team invite emote or actual invites, talk over area chat, make friends. If you're on PC, feel free to share your tag with me. There are other folks here on other platforms.
---
PA is just a very readily available way to do end game content. Not at all required, and not at all the strongest armor-- just easy to get and low maintenance cost. 
---
Spec into strength and intelligence if you want to do a HW build. Get those weight reduction perks, stability, and possibly power user for gatling lasers. Turn on one man army when facing scorchbeasts, to stagger and cripple them onto the ground. Have a 2H melee as a backup. Moderate stat distribution on everything else. 4 charisma minimum (I prefer 7), for lone wanderer R3.
---
A HW build with melee as backup can farm / craft and shred through PVE content easily.
---
I can make you a level 45 50 cal, with mods. Buuuuuut, I’m on holiday atm and won’t be back online till next week.
---
Survival Players are always Hostile (red) unless they just fast travelled to a train station, or are in an event with you is my understanding and experience. :)
---
Yeah now He will insult me while i farm the vtu Baseball cap, cant wait to cry while grinding
---
Yeah that already worked for me..
---
Haha! Quite true!
---
I appreciate your hard work, but this is kinda why I stopped playing. End game being a system of slot machines with no real controlling mechanism other than "pull more" is really not a great system.
---
There should be ways to control or steer advancement, such as allowing legendaries to be scrapped for a chance of the legendary component to build what you want, or sold to a special vendor for tokens, which with enough allows you to purchase specific legendary items or components.
---
So basically you're complaining at free dlc's, kinda sums up the type of person you are. Ignorant, negative and triggered at that
---
I usually don't join if I see 10+ people. My last 3 queen fights were all successful with up to 10 people. However, she flew back into the nuke zone or to the cavern entrace area each time. A few of us went after and she was losing health pretty visibly. I can only assume that when she flies back there, she loses the player count and now it is only 3-4 active players that count.

I think that....talking about a clan, when using something to build a clan CAMP, clan BASE or whatever, the resources would come from the clan stash and it would use that first to build everything. If there aren’t enough resources, one could select an option to auto build taking resources from personal stash
---
So I was recently informed from a friend that staggering a flying target (and for that matter crippling) often force the target to land as soon as possible if it is able too, so staggering Furios handmades or miniguns etc against the SBQ is the reason she was essentially permanent on the ground for me and my other unyleding bloodied melee to make mince meet of her. I just found it interesting that crippling and staggering both force a flying target to land, specifically scorchbeasts
---
Yes the rifles are different when you make them automatic. I believe it’s commando vs rifle man. I run almost the same set up on my main. I have a bloody set up so it’s kind of stealth sniper/ melee with an unyielding set and it’s pretty OP! As far as my rifle goes, I run all 3 rifleman X3 and tank killer in perception and nerd rage and demolition expert in intelligence (bloodied explosive lever is my main gun) and have adrenaline in agility. I think my dps is about 650 - 700. I also use iron fist X3 for my bloodied death claw gauntlet which is well over a 1000 per hit. Now obviously if you went full melee you could dump more into cards in strength. I have strength at 15 so it’s totally essential for me as far as weight reduction perks and stuff go. I’m sure other people have a more professional layout, I’ve just figured that stuff out on my own. Hope that helps 🤷‍♂️
---
Whatever keeps it at the top of the armor list so I dont have to search for it.
---
Yes. Dont do it. It's a pretty heavy investment to barely do anything. If you want vats go shotgun.
---
It was an Atomic shop item during faschnacht (might still be there, I'm not sure).  It's a super long horn with a mannequin at one end, but when you interact with it, it makes long tones. Repeatedly interacting will change the pitch of the tones.
---
Have you ever seen a Ricola cough drop commercial where they blow the horn at the end?  It looks like that
---
I know.  But to be honest I'd much rather it get pushed back than get released with issues or exploits.  This thing will likely tie into your stash after all.  Imagine if it gets released with some bug that enables someone to just snatch all your stuff.  It would be a nightmare, so I'm glad they're taking time to get it right.
---
Yeah worked for me too, got the note, but never killed him.
---
I would use it all the damn time if i could put a suppressor on it :(
---
BOOMSTICK....
---
really solid patch, cant wait to encounter a sheepsquatch
---
My Axe lies in its ancient slumber until this glorious day when it can be unleashed!
---
Biv, stop.  The shower isn't good for your treads.
---
I am still no sure how Vendor cap levels work.  I am guessing they are associated with me and not the server?  If a player with a load of stash goes to Whitesprings and sell enough to collect all 1400 caps and then I come behind him will there be any caps left?
---
So the only way you can alter the legendary effects on a gun is if it has a scorched receiver and the only way to alter any melee is the machete with sacrificial blade
---
Is it Christmas? This entire patch feels like Christmas. 
---
THANK YOU for all of these beautiful fixes and additions! No more VATS targeting friendlys, no more yelling at misaligned neon letters, no more lame Insult Bot, no more Black Screen of D00m, no more crazy loud Tinkering, no more notifications of supply drops we can’t have. 
---
And now we can name our stuff, we can shop for realsies at Whitesprings, we can actually “make a friend” and complete some challenges, we won’t have to be (as) intoxicated... and we’re gunna go sheepsquatch hunting!
---
Merry April Christmas, Appalachia!
---
Wait till the Sons of Dane radio signal pops up. That's your trigger that it's there, as I understand
---
I hate to say it though, it’s not indicative of anything. It’s purely “fear porn” speculation on your part. If you repair your weapons to 200% you can make it through most fights without anything breaking, plus if your carry more than one weapon you should never have to worry about weapons breaking because you can easily switch between them. This is a end game dungeon built for high level end game players, like I stated before, low level players should be in it. I personally think they should have a required level to enter in the dungeon but that’s just me.
---
I only hope that somehow Bethesda will give some usefulness to caps
---

It's the first post on the front page right now.
---
My biggest QoL complaint is for menus on PC.
---
When I use the keyboard to open a menu I expect to be able to use the keyboard to navigate the menu. But it seems if the cursor is near a menu item I cannot navigate away from the mouse cursor.
---
If I begin to move the mouse after entering the menu then the mouse cursor should work. But if I am using keyboard the game should ignore mouse inputs.
---
The amount of times I've hit ctrl-tab enter to fast travel to my team mate but instead block them is nuts. All because the mouse cursor happened to be near that menu option.
---
I hope this makes sense and I'm not the only one.
---
The handmade reload animation fix made my day, my character would always spazz out in third person when I reloaded the weapon while moving
---
T51-b
---
how bad is the lever action? should have gone for that instead...
---
I find people leave low lvls alone, so this actually make survival playable for those of us who take a week to gain 5 levels :).
---
Wtf is a corpse flower and where would we find them? Are they the urn-looking things with the “lid”?
---
If you’re gonna try it, make multiple builds early on. Play with each one a little bit, and delete the characters as you decide you don’t like them. If you’ve got a trustworthy buddy who plays, have them hop on, and give your loot that you wanna save to them to transfer to your other accounts. 
---
Personally, heavy weapons and melee feel great in this game, I’d spec for one of those, especially if you find a bloodied explosive weapon for those builds. Other than that, here’s some tips that will make the game a little easier 
---
1) Decide if you’re gonna rely on teaming up or going alone for playing, as charisma helps a lot when you have teammates. 
---
2) When it comes to looted weapons, scrap them if you’re build could use them but you have a better version/don’t want it, and sell them if they fall outside your build
---
3) Don’t always sell weapons outside your build. I use heavy guns but I saved a higher level lever action and use it to farm ammo in the forest, as it does enough damage to be ammo efficient and doesn’t burn through my precious heavy guns
---
4) Bulk your junk as often as possible, your stash inventory is limited, and bulking will really save your butt on running out of space. 
---
5) Certain enemies can drop certain types of junk, so keep track of what types of animals drop what type of junk for you in case you run dry of that resource. 
---
6)If you find a good camp spot, keep track of where it is. After you find a few that you have memorized you’ll know what to travel to to get close to it. 
---
7) pick your workshops carefully, they work as fast travel spots, and are useful for resource gathering, but some teams will have someone tail you, wait until you are far from the workshop, contest it, and one shot you. Once you hit high levels, get two workshops that are both close to the borders of two areas, and place your camp in another point that provides a good launch point for gathering resources. 
---
8)events are the best way of getting resources, weapons, schematics and ammo, so take part when you can

Game crash when exiting to desktop... or am i the only pc player having this problem ?
---
Thank you for posting this. It might seem small compared to some things, but I'm quite happy about the VATS not targeting friendlies anymore.
---
New Vegas style Deathclaw. Nice.
---
I wonder why the rifle itself is pretty low on the dps side
---
The Insult Bot never insulted me, and I think that's the highest form of insult: I wasn't even worth one...
---
I have no problem taking them down with my shotgun.
---
What if I wanted to go Melee/Shotgun? Would range be an issue like with Scorch Beast or something? Would Rifle/Melee or just straight Rifles be a better choice?
---
I did as well. I'm level 201 and can acquire Caps and Aid super fast so I would go into Survival and try to make it tough for players to find me. Upon my death I would put a 1500 cap bounty on my killer and then move on.
---
I try to be nice and tag but if someone's being greedy I say frak it, equip my bloodied tesla, and kill ERRTHANG. Don't blame me, blame bethesda's stupid game design lol. If they left the loot available to everyone in the area/event, this wouldn't be an issue.  
---
I've said this before, this tagging goofiness needs to be tossed along with every single thing that requires a server hop. Stupid gameplay design is stupid.
---
I think they have done something to hopping anyways. Been trying to find certain something for past days and i always rotate between 2-3 different servers. Logging off for little while seems to give new ones. Or going to survival game for a sec or two.
---
Oh Jesus Christ it’s not pay to win in the slightest. Most everybody can repair their weapons to 200% anyway. Now if the kits you could buy were able to repair above 200% that would be worrying. Stop with the mass hysteria on the shitty repair kits.
---
Still no legendary pipe revolvers?
---
"Liberator" will be the Name of my tse gaussrifle. Got to get that anchorage Veteran vibe
---
Hopefully with Player Vending.
---
I have always thought that it is very annoying. If you are bored, read a book. Giving away a couple of purifired waters is different than giving newbiew thousands of ammos, plans and weapons.
---
how much
---
The only downside I see is that it would have to be synced across every server simultaneously or it could lag and "dupe" items, unless your whole guild/clan/faction is only 'present' on 1 server at a time, but like you said, you have 40+ members so 2 full servers worth of people
---
Oh that would work p well! Having an option to take from either guild/clan stash or personal stash before inventory or the inverse.
---
lol and i thought i got roasted by him
---
The worst aspect is I'm pretty sure it slows down loading in for the first time. You can see it tick off and checkpoint all of those tapes as you're loading in.
---
There are 2 main builds I've run across.
---
VATS based stealth build
---
Melee build
---
each of those can try for a "Bloodied" build which really isn't worth it. But look into what perk cards would work best. Like the party boy / nuka cola perks combine really well making alcohol and nuka cola products really viable. I've yet to see a good pistol only build. Most of the time people are using rifles both manual and auto. Most anti armor perks are super worth it though
---
I'm testing the waters with a mage/intelligence/healer build. That's pretty tricky as I collectively wield about 6 heavy guns with a bunch of weight reduction perks.
---
Its possible its just a glitch in awareness though we did have the same damage with all mods with a 10mm pistol.
---
Me too, p2p is a shitty move by them imo
---
Ugh dude seriously.  I’m so happy for this.
---
I did try chat to him he wouldn't talk back
---
Possible Power Armor Mods?
---
I don’t know about PC, but I’ve seen a few for PS4 come up on /r/Market76
---
As of this patch you no longer need to fast travel all over the place, all factions share one cap pool now (still 1400 total).
---
Gutsies cap out at 52 or 54.
---
Also, Uranium fever is no longer gauranteed 3 star legendary enemies. Last night I saw 2 1 stars and a 2 star. No 3 stars. AWOL is always a 3 star lvl 50.
---
Crickets are one of the only enemies that still freak me out
---
Well of course killing its incentivized its the fucking PvP servers. There is no such thing as god/op gear every piece of legendary equipment is counter-able you can kill anyone with 1 star legendaries and a good build which is within everyones grasp. If you are losing thousands of caps you are doing something very wrong and need to rethink how you are playing. But people in this game don't want to be told they are terrible, they just think the game is too hard.
---
I don't recall them putting a date on it, just that it was something they were working on for the future.
---
They'd have to pay more licensing fees for actual songs, and if they did that, they'd have to get us to pay more. Community would complain, etc. But it is a nice idea aside from the reality of business, meaning it probably wouldn't happen.
---
Yes and no. If you are already in combat then putting away your weapon won't put you out of aggressive state. But yes, not having your weapon out while not in combat will make it harder for people to find you with vats.
---
That sounds fantastic to me! So, next week then?
---
"DONT SCRAP"
---
Sure you can do that, as long as you aren't currently in combat, not over encumbered, not "too close to enemies" or a half dozen other reasons why you couldn't fast travel. Wait, actually that sounds more like these repair kits are P2W seeing as it lets you ignore all those in game systems.
---
 I went there and he was a regular Yao guai
---
Well, seeing as Bethesda is ignoring this issue entirely I'm going to say they are just hoping it all blows over and they absolutely knew this would not go over well but want to do it anyways.
---
I'd pay for that.
---
No. Doesn't stop. Level 165, just got another pack last night.
---
ah crap ok
---
my base got destroyed 3 times last weekend, i dont really want to play until it gets fixed
---
 **Favorites:** When Favoriting  multiple weapons of the same type, the radial favorites wheel now  correctly saves players’ selections across play sessions. 
---
This just made my morning. I can't wait to get home and re-stock my favorites bar with all my 'perfect tool for the right situation' weapons. This was by far the most annoying bug to my pistols-only playstyle!
---
i agree, at least let us get different jukeboxes like the one at the nukashine bar
---
or, please make the juke boxes remember if they were turned on or off, mine always seems to turn itself back on when i fast travel back
---
I love it, I’m level 324, so being killed meant losing 648 caps. Every. Single. Time.... now it’ll be around 82, much better!
---
definitely the best thing in a patch that brought renaming, a quest, and vendor centralization...
---
So happy turrets can do a little more now.
---
It's been reported, along with the ChainSaw, Pipe Revolverm etc...
---
yeah i have a built up a reflexive use workbench immediately scrap junk key.... ive even walked up to a bench saying i wont scrap my bulk i wont..... FUCK ME!
---
would make sence to try to have it launch with the player vending
---
I think the US and the UK have proven that letting the masses decide is actually not always the best solution lol. We made some oopsies.
---
Maybe we will get dogs we can tame or something. Would be cool if we could wear it though
---
Yea while I’m not denying Fo76 has one of the nicest player bases I’ve ever seen and frankly one Bethesda doesn’t deserve considering how much they like to screw us over, that’s rust... rust is notorious for its freedom to grief and troll hence it attracts griefers and trolls
---
They don't have to do the top 3 at all. The inclusion of the leaderboard as a gameplay changing mechanic hurts the mode.
---
nope, my house got wrecked 3 times last weekend, by totally different people on different servers
---
That's what I'm thinking as well.  They're possibly tied together along with a way to make your camp visible.
---
I think Survival mode is a lot safer for us non min-maxed players to try out now. Now it's truly survival. Don't kill, don't get killed, enjoy the boosted XP.
---
Since I cant play until this evening, I wonder how this will affect "Bots on Parade", most of those mobs spawn neutral...
---
That's genius
---
Certainly seems that way doesn't it, its been what? 4 days without a response from them on the subject
---
It says legendary though and there are no legendary power armor mods. I think these might be like the scorchkiller mod or whatever the mod is that adds a star to the machete.
---
Were these possible legendary effects in FO4?
---
Has hunger bars going down too fast been fixed?
---
Anything on the random Technical Data that likes to swat me in the face upon log in? Lol
---
I don’t want to brag but I have two dog helmets so am I now Cesar Millan?
---
Honestly I hope you are right and more people come to survival. I think getting 15 caps for killing a level 60 is pretty sad... Pretty sure that doesn't pay for the bullets/ materials to repair your weapon from killing that guy.  Or even 37 caps for killing you that barely pays for a bunch of bullets from a vendor.
---
ugh that means another month away, welp time to find something else to play for awhile
---
"Aren't you a little tall for a Napoleon?"
---
Ty
---
Mad becouse you cant abuse it with your friends?
---
yep, both current and max durability. it even says so in the help screen.
---
I love dropping my .38 for low level/new players, I always pick up too much, especially as it doesn't contribute to my weight cap. Casually walk over to a couple low levels and drop 3k .38 LUL, they scramble for it.
---
Id really like to do a Rifle (non-auto) or Shotgun build, open to Melee but worried about not having any range.
---
Play time is best time. :)
---
Makes sense to deploy this simultaneously with player vending. Might be a bit rude to let people mini-nuke trade posts. ;)
---
Oh my god yes we need NV style casinos. With black jack and ghoul hookers, of course.
---
Shit. I was gonna crow about my TI-99, but you got me beat.
---
I'll keep an eye out on that. Thanks.
---
Yes, please. A keyring and letting us get rid of these would be my next topmost Quality of Life improvements, now that renaming items is a thing so i can finally tell what my Power Armor is before i take a wild guess in placing one of the three i have
---
My first day playing I was given a marine helmet and hardened rifle by a stranger. Honestly, forever grateful :)
---
That you consider them patching the game to the half-baked "finished" state it should've been released in over the term of a year "Free dlc's" sums up the person you are too. Naive, exploitable and triggered by anyone criticising obviously negative things. But hey, stick to your delusions.
---
Don't insult my pets! &gt;:(
---
Totally agree thanks for info
---
i love all this! but they would need to be differnet songs that what plays on the radio, as we already have radios
---
It's a camp item added when we had the fasnacht parade. You had to buy it from the atom shop.
---
It looks like a mannequin with an instrument that kinda looks like a digeeredoo but it curves up near the end and is like 6ft long
---
I pray you are right
---
Was it on the golf course?
---
That's fort defiance, just run past her into the building.  And grab all the straight jackets.  With the vender card maxed you get 43 caps per jacket and usually i can get 12 or more in a run.
---
I cook so much food, there’s no way I could have ever eaten it all regardless. But yes, that seems to be listed in the idea that food now spoils more evenly.
---
Have you ever seen a mole rat with frag mines strapped to it? I just saw one of these for the first time.
---
Damn.. And i loved farming high lv's like you with my lv70 vats/stealth/sniper :D
---
Lol I was sweating bullets in survivor mode risking above 200 caps every encounter with another human.
---
My best moment was killing a lvl 259 for over 500 caps and like 80 psycho buff lol but I can see why they nerfed it, the high risk was keeping me away from the mode more often than I’d have liked.
---
I'm your Huckleberry! Seriously though, I haven't done the quest on three of my high level characters, so I can hook you up. Just be patient for two or three days.
---
I guess so. I guess you're the dog whisperer of the wasteland!
---
Youre not the fist to suggest this. I say we wait and see. I don't see why there wouldn't be any tables in there and I don't see it being that long that a fully repaired weapon will break. But like I said we wait and see. I'm not happy about repair kits but I'm also not jumping to conclusions. I'll be happy or get mad, when the time comes haha
---
"Soon" as per official sources.
---
Possibly when player vending is out, as turning on your vending machine will mark your ~~settlement~~ CAMP on everyone's map.
---
1 I don't play with anyone and 2 no I'm mad that the pvp trolls will be on pve servers farming caps now
---
I hope you blocked and reported all of them.
---
You still can, it just won’t be as rewarding! Haha
---
He kept telling me he was on an insult mission, like I was in his way. Then he'd follow me around. Had to kill him several times out of annoyance.
---
That explains the legendaries I’m getting from glowing alphas then lol
---
Precisely what I thought. You’re being punished for playing the game and leveling at that point
---
My cultist dagger will be- Mothmans judgment
---
Then why have the repair kits for sale? You could
---
simply craft repair kits at a workbench if it was only about convenience IMO.
---
Don’t feel like I’m hysterical - I’ll be logging in to play today - but also have seen enough to know this is only the first trial ballon.
---
Personally I'd be ok with some limited in game findable displays, and much cooler ones available as atom shop skins.  I'd hate to see those without the means totally excluded from camp displays (realizing they can get atoms in game, but means also includes playtime)
---
If you’re referring to the plants in the Cranberry Bog, than no. The only ones I’ve ever found were part of a daily quest in the upper reaches of the Forest near the Super Mutant ran sawmill.
---
I'm not a high level but I leave known recipes and plans in the overseers cache around flatwoods or the camp. I try to share what wholesomeness I've received and my experiences haven't been as toxic as people make the game out to be and I like to take my part in keeping it friendly in ways that I can.
---
What about it, the Firecracker Whiskey?
---
Yep, exactly! It made grinding for the legendary weekly weapons, erm..... expensive!
---
Heck, half the time we're just happy to offload stuff and it's a bonus that someone else can use it. Last weekend I was near Top of the World and I hear someone on mic saying "help! help!" I look around, no one doing the help gesture. Look at the map and nearby there's a level 5 who has no business being up there. I seek him out, and still on mic he asks "you got any stimpaks? I'm dying."
---
He had no way of knowing this, but I had just the night before installed Better Inventory and discovered to my horror that even with Travelling Pharmacy giving me a 90% weight reduction on meds, I was carrying 31 pounds of stimpaks. I happily gave him 25 - 2.5 lbs off my carry weight, 25 lbs off my stash. Given my hoarding tendencies I couldn't just dump it all, but it felt OK giving it to someone who could use it. Also dumped all the 10mm and .38 ammo and grenades I always seem to have on me that I never use, as well as a half pound of rad-x and radaway and some purified water (why do I always have like 80 purified water? Oh yeah, because I feel not collecting it from my water purifier the second it's ready is a "waste" and I aggressively farm technical data so I'm constantly getting 8-10 water rewards).
---
After a suggestion by a fellow reddit wasteland wanderer my bloodied rolling pin shall now forever be called Gordon WHAMsey lol, oh and I have a bladed commie wacker I’m going to name Chuckles 😂
---
I got one shoted by a lvl 61 radghoul. Like he spawned right behind me and killed me in 1 hit. I was wearing lvl 50 x01 prototype power armor too. Lol.
---
Yea that's the main problem that comes up every time...well...i was thinking about a "digital" stash with a fisical form, so that it's synced across servers ? you put stuff in the fisical bin, it is then sent to the digital bin and pops up in every clan stash in the different servers, provided that we don't get a different place to build our clan base in.
---
I think that's a safe bet. You'll probably end up with an even SPECIAL spread. Enforcer is a good perk to have for shotguns. It can take out most enemies quickly. Do some research into criticals. Getting criticals on high level enemies is worth it for overall damage.
---
If you want to play around with it
---
 [https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/)
---
Cool cool, that's great and all, but where's the player vending? On the Wild Appalachia Roadmap it said it would release today?
---
Yeah... Im a ritualistic raider. Clothing and everything. Only prey on people if they come to close to the lucky hole mine. Either we force them to bow to Cthulu or we demand caps/kill them.
---
Neck Slits and Chill is pretty cool too.
---
Basically its good etiquette in general to always get one slap on a legendary and then lets others also get damage in on it, that way everyone gets a legendary weapon drop when the enemy dies, aside from that just participating in the events is great and not just standing around doing nothing like some players do!
---
Im kinda hoping its a local issue
---
True. Thats definitely been an issue.
---
Had a player that attacked others while we where fighting the SQB and just looked at the idiot as he was jumping infront of me and trying to knife me.
---
Bloodied Lever Action, Handmade, or Gatling Gun.
---
no near the overseers camp by v76, i have been there since i started playing so like 4 months now, I made it as a friendly stop for all new players, it has free and open crops/water/stations and a nifty bar to relax at
---
but for some reason last weekend its like my house was a griefer magnet
---
one person i messaged after i asked WHY did they do that, and they said they were bored and jealous of my house
---
wtf?!?!
---
Yeah I just read the patch notes. This is better. I still think it should be removed completely
---
the set by blackwater mine  is usually raider and in the "arena" at the raider camp by the top of the world
---
It's missing from bivs quests
---
I’m going to name my legendary golf club “fore!”
---
I read that too quickly and thought you were suggesting they give radscorpions the ability to scream at us.
---
*radscorpion shoots out of the ground*
---
Me: “**AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH**”
---
Radscorpion: “**AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH**”
---
Is there a reason the repair kits were "hotly suggested" yet a quick search of the of this sub for the terms "repair kits" or "repair kit" turn up 0 results older than 4 days old when they were announced
---
It spawns at the Uranium Fever mine and there is sometimes a full set that spawns from a dead raider to the NE of the munitions factory.
---
I payed someone on the 76 market to paint BOS Paladin paint on my T60 with a jetpack. He had every paint from Initiate up to Elder. I think they where added in one of the patches kinda recently but can't confirm that
---
I hope for an ear-splitting volume on that thing. They must hear me back home around Vault 76!
---
So for 1400 caps, how many Civil War top hats is that?
---
I think that would be a great addition to the game.
---
I came across a dog the other day. Shame I didn't have those taming perks.
---
Here’s my suggestion  to find out since no one likes tse in pvp there trash, check if 1 or 2 bullets fire out and wether it’s explosive if it’s 12 it’s tse if its  1 it’s not and is probobly the far superior Exceutioners, Anti armour, bloodied or Furious.
---
Minigun or MG42 they just slap
---
&gt;\&gt;But that's also not saying "nothing but cosmetics" which has been the battle cry of most on here which I don't believe they ever said.
---
Pete Hines said it numerous times that it would be purely cosmetics and have no bearing on gameplay at all.

I never seem to be able to get within range, except in certain terrain. I use combat with long barrel and no muzzle, enforcer, skeet shooter. Unless they're flying very low I can't touch them. Perhaps if others aren't having this issue I'll need to investigate further.

# XBOX ONE X:
---
I'm still having some glitchy issues with my game for a very long time, and I haven't seen these 2 things talked about yet, or being fixed. The one problem isn't too much of a big deal, but the other is pretty major
---
**#1(major).** **100% guaranteed to happen and I CAN recreate EVERY TIME:**
---
\-20% weapon weight/chem weight gear stops working when joining a game while already in a game. Overall carried weight increases PAST where you were before you joined the new map. Doesn't matter if you're naked or have everything equipped. **Normal server hopping does NOT cause this issue, only when joining someone's game while I'm playing in a FO76 server already.**
---
**How to re-create the problem:**
---
I'm playing with 4 different pieces of -20% reduced weight gear equipped(weapon weight, and food/water/chem). I'm 900+- lbs WITH them all equipped. **I either get an invite, or join someones game through the xbox profile menu while I'm still in my current map.** The game goes to the main title screen, I get a disconnected error, the new world loads/spawns, and suddenly I'm at 1200+-1300+- Lbs WITH my armors still equipped. I can unequip/re-equip  some of my weapon weight gear, and the numbers don't change(meaning they aren't proccing), while un-equipping/re-equipping some other weight reduction armor does show the numbers fluctuating(meaning they are proccing).
---
Test #1: I have unequipped ALL of my armor beforehand, and have recorded the weight at 1178+-(give or take). When the above issue happens(joining a game while in a game already), I'm gaining a phantom 200+- to 300+- lbs when I spawn in. Re-Equipping the armor does not help. I have to leave the server, then re-join. 
---
**"FIX"/workaround:**
---
If I want to join someone's map either by accepting an invite, or joining through their xbox profile, **I HAVE to leave my current map FIRST** by going through the FO76 map, menu, disconnect options. Once at the title screen, I can join someone no problem, and my weight is where it should be. 
---
**Problem #2 (minor):**
---
If I'm playing in a map, but disconnect when someone is talking in the public server chat, their name and speaker icon do not leave my screen, even in a new server. 
---
For example:
---
I want to server hop so the vendor I'm at displays new plans/items. Some person is on their mic, yelling at robots, and I can see their name with an active speaker icon in the bottom left corner of my screen. I go through the process of disconnecting through the map, menu, disconnect.. Get back to the main screen, log into a new server, and their name and icon is still in the bottom left of my screen, even though they aren't in my server. I can server hop 8 more times, and the name will be there. This same thing will also happen if the server crashes and takes me back to the title screen.
---
The fix/workaround:
---
Option 1. Go into the xbox menu, hit options on the game, click quit, then reload the game. Option 2. Completely turn off xbox bu holding power button for 10 seconds. power up and reload game. 
---
There is no other way to get rid of the name on the screen.
---
Three guys came after me out of nowhere. I just kept walking to my destination until I eventually died from the half damage. They wasted ammo, got bounties (which continued to wrack up to like 300 caps for each) and I got a laugh and lost nothing because I didn’t build anything at the time so I didn’t need scrap.
---
Interested in the bolt and lever action. Add me and see if I have anything you want to trade for. Psn - brm138
---
That’s pretty much my character haha. RIP snagging 400 caps on a high level kill
---
Due to literal statistics it’s a flat 50% chance to get triple caps. It’s basically flipping 5 coins and trying to get all heads. Odds don’t change after each flip, but require a heads to move on
---
I had no idea.
---
If you arent lvl 50 or higher you wont belong on this quest.
---
Okay, thanks ! :)
---
I don't have access to enclave yet..I wonder how that will play out
---
Exactly that but please never mention ghoul hookers again.
---
nope, i have seen the fallen satellite there and the lemonade vendor, so thats not it, and again, its been there for 4 months with no issues
---
i think i just got really unlucky with griefing assholes last weekend i guess
---
I would have been OK with just the caps pooled. But not upset by this version either.
---
Can only speak for myself. I didn't like FO4. Just didn't get sucked in like previous games. Wasn't even going to get FO76, but then release day came, and I said lemme give it a go. I instantly loved the in game world - it was totally a Fallout game. Loved the lore, loved to hear the individual stories, and playing it over a few months developing the main story got me more and more into it. It is a good story really.
---
Also if you like exploring, looting, and just trying to find something new - and there always is something, it's a great game. I am more addicted to it now than I ever was. Have started multiple characters also. 
---
Back to FO4. Coming up on 200hours in 76, I've actually started 4 again and giving it the go I didn't before! So each to their own but when you get into it, it's such a great game. It's a solid platform for a Fallout universe that can only continue to grow and get better!
---
I assumed they'd look the same as New Vegas. Alas, I was wrong. Then again, a lot has changed. I miss super sledges looking bad ass.
---
That's funny. I haven't fought her yet but it seems like it's an "All hands on deck" situation.
---
i love all this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
The counter switch doesn't work other than to display how many times it's been triggered. All other expected functions are broken.
---
The random switch isn't triggered by signal input but by manual switch, then it randomly sends power to one of the outputs. Pretty useless unless you build some sort of Russian roulette room or something.
---
Someone should make more mini-games like this. Good job. Also when you make the video can you link it to me? Thank you
---
The cap rate for survival is fair af now.
---
No, you don't want to mix rifles with melee, as they don't share the same stats for perks. Mixing shotties with melee is fine, but HW are significantly friendlier for killing SB.
---
My lever action rifle is going to be named rooty tooty aim and shooty
---
Be level 1-50 with 1star level 10 legendary items, get 1shot by people around lv200 (multiple times), lose all caps and junk and aid, fun game?
---
Nah they stick around indefinitely regardless of whether you have the perks equipped or not
---
I am SO ready to be able to rename my Power Armor. Not knowing which is which has been a major pain in the ass!
---
I agree that anything under 50 is probably too low for those reasons. But the avg level of players is going up. I think this is more sustainable for the future of survival mode. We will see
---
PA T51-b 
---
PA T60 
---
PA X-01
---
I need to max out that perk card
---
Yea, fair enough, i agree on that one. Seeing how easy it was done with the Artillery thingy, now imagine in that stash...yea...they would have to step up their game
---
no, they can be yellow, if they havent drawn a weapon.
---
I got to try this so I can have an army!
---
Ohhhhhsuuuhhhweeeetttt
---
Bloody hell its not like they're selling Broken weapons that do 2k damage, just a kit that allows a player to repair a weapon. They would be useful in a SBQ, PvP and the future vault raids. If you don't like/want them, don't sodding bye them! I completely understand why people are upset about it, but what happens if you don't have time to grind materials to repair things? This game caters for everyone
---
Yeah weird that’s happening now. I’m seeing far less destruction of my camp in adventure mode since survival mode launched. In survival mode it seems to get torched twice as often though :)
---
Raider PA's have specific spawn locations.. Here is the wiki about them.. 
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power\_armor\_locations\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power_armor_locations_(Fallout_76))
---
you need better friends. We pass around our epic legendaries on loan all the time without issues. To play with, mod, or whatever.
---
Oh yeah? Being selfish? So him keeping routes he farmed and learned himself is being selfish? You’re upset because you can’t use the fruits of someone else’s labor. Feed me the down votes you lazy asses
---
No. I see a couple good ones but you have to remember this game isn’t only pvp. I recommend you go Kill some sbq before you ask for more damage nerfs for sure.
---
Blueprints... I deleted mine and now on the camp menu it does not allow you to create a new one or show anything on the blueprint tab. There are no buttons or choices to make a new one so I'm unable to blueprint at all
---
Easier places to find it are Camden Park, Cliff Watch, and the Crosshair. I see it regularly at the first two, but only once at the Crosshair. It is rng but you have to look for it in Raider camps/territory.
---
To see if it’s just a graphical error we’d need to then test shots to kill said armored target? Drum mag vs a piercing mag?
---
I have an answer for #3
---
No matter the type of weapon (ballistic or energy), if it has the explosive legendary effect, the Grenadier perk DOES NOT cause an increase to the radius of the explosions from the gun. I have no answer as to why, but the explosive radius is the same size with and without the perk, so if you're using that perk solely on explosive legendary weapons and not a missile launcher or something, save yourself a couple SPECIAL points and drop that perk
---
Yes, there are loads of human NPCs, but if you're on the 'whiny bitchy' list then you cant see them. 
---
let me just check your username.
---
oh, sorry..
---
There are a few problems with your suggestions, for example not gaining wanted level when you don’t have the caps to pay for the penalty: this would be a griefers dream come true. Just deposit all caps on your mule and go on a rampage – no penalties.
---
Also, why the nerf to Talons and Twisted? 
---
There are some ideas I like though.
---
The repair kits have no weight....
---
Any idea how the new clothes are obtained? I see they’re “drops” but is there any indication how they’ll specifically drop? I’m guessing if there are static spawns they aren’t data-mineable. I’m talking about the monogrammed hat and the “fixer suit” and those kind of thing. Thanks!
---
Anything that drains AP, drains the FC. 
---
Sneak builds are supposed to be outside PA, and use lowest weight possible. Make sure to invest into sturdy frame and ultralight mods. Shrouded with wood armor ideally.
---
Isn't it obvious  shotgun=Boomstick
---
One spawns by the raider camp up the road from West Tek fairly often
---
But yeah single server team or guild stashes would be cool, at least you could deposit "free to take" items in there for team mates to use without having to dig through your personal stash every time they wanted something, allowing you to get on with whatever you were doing
---
And nerfs to armour. Sentinel is easily negated you just have to understand game mechs
---
Yup... Currently one of the weakest builds. It's not that it's bad, its just that it's damage output doesn't come as easy as melee. You really need excellent weapons to make it shine.
---
You've killed 100+ different players? What about the word "survival" translates to "hunt the circles of the level 14 who has just been alive for 1 hour"
---
I solo the SBQ with my melee character. I know what im talking about. Me hitting 2500+ with my melee is not okay.
---
I have been super busy and not been able to play for over two weeks. I only got to play one day in Helvetia during that event. I feel like I’m going to miss some things. Do these events stop or have a deadline?
---
I keep plans, recipes, and mod duplicates every time I find them, just so I can give them to low level players. Payback for the times higher level players helped me out or saved my b*tt when I was new. Good karma!
---
Recently announced via social it was moved to May. (In the patch notes today, they mention adding some icons that will be used later on for vending, so it’s definitely coming.)
---
In my opinion Fallout 76 gives the Player the most Agency I have ever seen in a game.
---
Whelp... I got my money's worth out of the game. Maybe when they come out I'll be ready to move on. And it will be easy to not come back once I stop playing and find other games. I hated these things in GTA online but at least R\* never promised that it would be cosmetic only (but it has made it a worse game. So many obvious decisions that are made to make the game frustrating in order to encourage more shark card sales).
---
Monogrammed hat is a static spawn. Fixers suit is a quest/event reward
---
Idgaf about his crappy route. You deserve all your downvotes. I'm never said he has to share them, but should. There's a difference
---
*Mutations:*
---
* *Talons and Twisted Muscles mutations reduced to 5% damage increase (6.25% with Strange in Numbers).*
---
* *Twisted Muscles no longer effects Unarmed damage.*
---
If they were nerfed that hard you might as well remove them from the game entirely as they'd become useless due to the negative effects being more prevalent than the positive ones even with Class Freak 3.
---
Yeah that'll show them! ...oof
---
The dangerous quote is from the Raiders vendor not.
---
Why do people enjoy watching boxing or MMA?  Why did thousands of people attend the coliseums of old to witness fights to the death?
---
We are animals.  Never kid yourself that we are not.  When society falls, safety and security go with it.  Until community is reestablished, we revert to our base drivers.  Sometimes this means we help others; sometimes it means we help ourselves at the expense of others.
---
Our sense of community can never be reestablished on servers limited to a random set of 24 players.
---
I've got some if you still need a fix
---
Armor piercing magazines do not show up with the Awareness perk, but they do work. 
---
The theoretical best armor-piercing would be Anti-armor (50%), Incisor 3 (75%), Best armor penetration mod (40% ? ) and Exterminator 3 (75%) = 98.12% armor ignored, but I think armor ignore is capped at 90%.
---
On PC? I would be forever grateful. That was the most fun gun in the game but I had to sell it as it just wasn't holding up in the Savage Divide and higher areas. Add me, IGN: gilpo, and let me know how much you want for it. I'm on mostly 9p-1a us eastern on weeknights. No hurry, as I've been looking for one for months.
---
Yes, I use an aa/ss sledge with incisor and penetrating mod. When it lands pop a psychobuff and deathclaw steak, gone in no time. In the mire they never want to land; maybe its all the tree cover, but can easily pass 5-10 minutes without landing.
---
Hmmm, well besides being close to enemies or over encumbered what are these half dozen other reasons why you cant fast travel? Also you don’t carry more then one weapon with you at all times, that’s your own fault for not being prepared.
---
Yes it is. I can hit 1500 with a shotgun or rifle too. Melee you have to be beside them.
---
i once gave a level 18 guy an anti armor pipe rifle with a lvl 2 legendary status.
---
When wanted it doesn't make the wanted noise when you close your pip boy.  
---
THANK YOU IT WAS SO LOUD
---
Perfect for avoiding those WS Station campers in with their Assassins/Sent gear who rack up 10s of kills.
---
Not salty, just not interested in PvPing with \*you\*.
---
you are braver than i to take your house into survival, i have been thinking about making a new character to do it with, as i really love  CAMP
---
Keep in mind OVN only pops at night, so if you spawn into a daytime server, hop on.
---
Thats not what i ment. You cannot gain WANTED if you dont have the caps. Like you can only destroy 1 camp item if you only have 5 caps.
---
Stack, like shown as Quantities in a single entry in your inventory?
---
Or...
---
Stack, like install multiple types on the same mod slot of your power armor?
---
1st, Yes.  2nd, No.
---
I raise your Robert Smith with a Morrissey ;)
---
I get that, but I'm also coming from the point that it's a game. Not to mention, there's nothing to say they died immediately in minutes as well and didn't set up any type of base camp. But like I said I'm not saying your wrong or I'm right. I'm just saying lets wait and see how they do it and then we go from there!
---
I dunno. I asked this the other day and didn’t get any responses. I’ve seen people saying it does and doesn’t though when I’ve researched it so I’m confused still.
---
If they're half as strong as these patch notes imply, workshop defense should be much easier!
---
Lol. Video pls
---
This....this is mind blowing awesome
---
I'm shooting people on sight regardless of the cap reward. That's just icing on the cake.
---
You clearly don’t know what you’re talking about lol
---
My super sledge will be called smashy smashy!
---
Let's hope they are at least as loud as the siren!
---
And i wish we could switch connect them too..
---
I'll keep playing it until they add things that ruin it for me, but ill still be pissed that they went against their word and not buy them on the principle of it, aswell as ruling out buy atoms entirely which, at the moment, isnt ruled out
---
Yeah, how it was is I could kill 5-10 lvl 50+ coming at me, then lose more than I gained after one death. It was hilarious because they'd get that taste of caps and just keep coming, could usually come out with more caps but not by much if I died at all.
---
Lmao? If it’s so crappy why do you wanna know my guy?  “Idgaf about his crappy route” “I never said he has to share it. But should” buddy you obviously care about it
---
So many good things: Custom names, pooled vendor caps, fixed assaultron head, etc. I hope the performance fixes are enough to make the SBQ playable.   
---
The one thing I expected this patch that's missing is a fix for **Biv's volume**. He's funny, but I miss half of what he says.
---
Repair packs will be sold in the ATOM store, despite a promise that all ATOM store items would be cosmetic.
---
&gt;Escape Artist: Gaining invisibility from the Chameleon Mutation while already invisible from the Escape Artist Perk, or vice versa, no longer results in permanent invisibility.
---
The Escape Artist perk grants invisibility? Since when?
---
This will bring more people to survival but they should add some penalty for people who play this mode with no caps.
---
When is maintenance finished???
---
I don't I'm trying to help all the people above who I agree with and disagree with you and your petty friend
---
Don’t disagree - just making a suggestion to improve the experience given the change. If some players wants to pay for an advantage, good on them.
---
But why would us knowing they paid for an advantage be a problem or a big deal? I’m not advocating for scorched earth, just suggesting a way to make it more palatable for those that want to play a different way - especially given that we already paid when we bought the game.
---
Like you said “the game caters for everyone” so why not cater a bit to those that aren’t paying for advantages?
---
This is a great example of what’s wrong with the late game gameplay loop. I have a number of items I’d like to actively farm, but there’s either no information out there on how, or more likely, there is no way to farm other than just playing the game normally and hoping. Remember when people found out that jail break event had a decent chance to drop handmade plans? We need more like that.
---
The area directly over the bumblebee on the map - it lies near the centre, to the right of the Whitespring. It was such a beautiful spot, overlooking the mountains. I’m not particularly fond of hostile camps though, so it didn’t work out for me. Low level ghouls, scorched, and super mutants. Good place to farm caps though!
---
Some people have no interest in pvp. I'm one of those ppl
---
Protectron then. Please assume the position.
---
Alpine Horn: Increased the volume of the Alpine Horn’s sound effects when activated.
---
We are all winners now.
---
Those new PA skins look amaaazing. I will definitely be buying a few of those. I'm glad people are going to be able to make fancy, functional bars now too.
---
Sure man, I also have it (:
---
Today, legendary vendor is next month.
---
If I could spell it I would name All Rise after Thors hammer.
---
That Excavator Raider Skin is exactly what I've been saving my atoms for. Wow.
---
Bethesda say they read reddit. If we get enough comments and Up votes maybe they will do it :)
---
Have tried that in the past, also just tried again. No luck.
---
I love the look of them, but the music doesn't feel right...if it can only play 1 song on repeat, at least make it "Jukebox Saturday Night" from Appalachia radio!
---
I assume it refers to the cryolater and perfect storm.
---
I hope I'm wrong though.
---
Are you able to tell if there is any sounds connected to the items? Like the plushes and so?
---
They dont work for me on my wheel. It plays the animation and nothing happens. I hear people say this works for them but on the other hand just as many people say it doesnt work.
---
I noticed this also. It specifically listed armor effects of incendiary and cryogenic. No idea what they mean there.
---
What platform are you on? I'm just up the hill from there and no one has ever hassled me. And I see others camp where you are all the time. I'm on PC.
---
fair enough
---
I have a TSE LMG and i'll name it Gustav as soon as servers will be back.
---
if a player is unarmed then they also only take 50% damage..
---
I love that guy.
---
Yes.  1400 total caps (across all faction vendors) per person, every 20 hours.
---
You notice how rifles are still the meta? Because it evens itself out. I bet youre one that complained about shops not selling everything at once, and having to fast travel to different vendors.
---
ahhh then no I haven't seen any either
---
THIS. I have no idea why you're downvoted.
---
That warrider skin and raider skin is sick
---
I’m having a laugh about it chill man I know what’s up not completely ignorant
---
WADR, the advantages are minimal *now* but this is likely the first on many Atom items that effect play.
---
As I said in the OP, I get it - it’s a way for BGS to make more money. I don’t feel like BGS betrayed some “sacred promise” and my heart is broken forevermore.
---
All I’m suggesting is that we know who’s playing with the paid advantages, whatever they may be.
---
If it’s no big deal, then a player shouldn’t mind being ID as such.
---
True balance, you don't become wanted if you have 0 caps. LUL
---
They don't make any money from you playing the game. If you aren't actively influencing others to buy en masse (twitch or youtube w/ large following) or spending tons on mtx, you're not even a blip on their radar. They have all they can get from you. Unfortunate, but that's just the way it is.
---
There's some great stuff in there.  So long, atom horde :D
---
I just sneak in their windows and leave a big bag of goodies on the floor for them to find when they get home. Kinda like the tooth fairy lol
---
Whew doggie you've got me rolling over here😂
---
By any chance, do you have the sneak perk maxed out, or chameleon armor?  I'm wondering if it's a glitch related to that.
---
Yea it's weird because I want those effects on some weapons but they weren't put in the game. They where in F04
---
Cap Collector Fixed!!!! Thank the nine divines!!!
---
I'm confused now. Someone told me next month. I think I remember it saying April 9 I think. I'm gonna google it.
---
Is Always Vigilant still a completely terrible event quest?
---
I haven't done it in a few weeks, but the last time I did I found it to be just the worst. You've got a Level 1 eyebot that you're supposed to protect, while wave upon wave of level 42 Scorched run up to attack it. The eyebot flies DIRECTLY towards these Scorched and gets one shot killed OVER AND OVER AGAIN, and you have a short timer to repair it. 
---
The last time I attempted this quest, it took about 90 steel that I had on me, until I ran out of steel scrap. When I ran out of steel, of course the timer ran out, which made me fail the quest. Worst event ever, if you don't have a ton of steel scrap to waste you shouldn't even attempt it, and even then it gives very little as compensation.
---
25% caps reduc? Could have kept it at player level. Hope it goes back up, it eliminates half of the point of PVP.
---
I might actually play survival mode now!
---
Hmm I’ve never had a problem that’s weird. But believable.
---
7th May
---
I think some people know the change is coming and are acting out. As the duper ban loomed, things got ugly. Now that base demolishers are being dealt with, and they don't like that.
---
That is not what im talking about. You cannot deal damage to a camp without caps.
---
they were delayed im afraid. proper gutted
---
Vending machines were pushed back to May according to a recent Inside the Vault
---
Agreed.  And no more of this cap farming crap for the exploiting idiots.
---
Were they higher leveled than you?
---
If so, in my mind, that means they cant fight someone of similar level and are afraid of dying.
---
I have one, will be adding it my player vendor store when that happens ;)
---
I found a level 3 guy in Watoga. I don't have a mic so I couldn't ask how he got there. I gave him 25 Stimpaks and marveled. It was the least I could do for being so ballsy.
---
Perhaps he got Nukashine'd as another poster mentioned he gives them to noobs.
---
That's what I just did
---
Glad to be of help :)
---
It takes quite a bit of effort to arrange and name everything (over an hour) 
---
So its nice to know people appreciate it :)
---
I think it would improve some of the gameplay.... A lot of 76 is still broken in my eyes, but i still enjoy playing it. The Perfect version of a Fallout MMO would actually put you in the Fallout world based on your ip address and give you the option to venture to other parts of the "Fallout" Continental US. Living in Colorado would mean i would start out in Dogtown.
---
Ahh, mustve missed that update.
---
Well when we get actually beneficial p2w items, we'll have a complain bit for now, we may as well just brush it off
---
Yeah, I originally kept a jukebox in camp just turned off since the music feels so...wrong, but the model is so cute! Had to delete it as I got sick of switching it off over and over. :(
---
They said recently it was pushed back to May.  :(
---
Its only animals from random encounter spots...and u can only have 1 ata time. Its fun tho......
---
Btw: i also have 2 dog helmets....the responcibility is a burden
---
This says it's for armour, and the only Incendiary effect I can think of is the one on Perfect Storm, but that's a weapon not a armour piece... And I have found no record in the wiki stating that this effect is in-game or obtainable at the least.
---
Maybe we'll get a unique new armour piece in the up coming quest that has those effects? Or could even be introduced with the patch as a new effect that can be gained for either a secound or third star?
---
While it was somewhat frustrating to lose upwards of 300-400 caps on death, it was also the chance at gaining that same amount upon a kill that got me so excited to play survival. I like the ability to kill people whenever I see them, but I also want a bit of a cap reward from them, not 25% of their level. That doesn't even inviting to me anymore. There doesn't feel like there's much of a reward for a kill now to me. Haters can hate, I just wanted to voice my opinion
---
That's why I make sure I have stuff to sell before talking to vendor and have my hard bargaining perk and have my charisma maxed out. lol
---
Could be up to 3 or 4 hours, depending on numerous factors. Possibly less or more...
---
Dammit, now I don't know if I should get the Firebreathers gear, or wait for the Raider Excavator since I can't afford both (most likely)
---
Finally a bunch of stuff that I actually want to buy!
---
So like your damage output against camp object goes to 0 when you don’t have the caps? I see.
---
Pretty sure this is the fix.
---
It came out a while ago that scrap all was supposed go be scrapping bulked stuff and the bug was that it wasn't happening. This is how it's supposed go be unfortunately.
---
I use the lunch box in the train station there a lot since most people open it for food/drinks.
---
And molemen. I have seen them higher, but it is rare. Usually they are max level 40.
---
Can you put the dog helmets on tamed dogs?
---
Fair point.
---
I think you're overreacting tbh.
---
You get a pack every 5 levels and a perk point every level. I'm currently at 127
---
Usually its 1-3h but dont know if it will take longer today as theyre adding a whole new questline, could be wrong though
---
First time I logged in a while was the other day.. I’m doing some farming getting ready for player vending &amp; out of nowhere an insult bot walks up to me &amp; tells me to halt.. so I’m frozen waiting for this thing to say ANYTHING.. I eventually took an axe to his head I thought he was supposed to stand there like a coat hanger😂

It’s the same world but to activate the Biv questline you need to find the party poster at a train station and interact with it, it will be the same for the sheepsquatch questline, a poster will be displayed at Lewisburg apparently and train stations and you can get the poster from the atom store for your camp as well then just just interact with it and the quest should pop up on your screen
---
The map locations for the top killers and caps/aid reduction definitely makes me want to try it out now.
---
I appreciate it a lot!  It is the highlight of every patch day for me.
---
Hahaha!! Yes!
---
saving.
---
If you can pay for something that improves QOL and isn’t strictly cosmetic, it’s pay to win.
---
Change my mind.
---
If you have a flip five coins and win them all to get tier five, that’s .5^5=3.125%, unless I’m massively misunderstanding your explanation.
---
usually it has been around 2-3 hours
---
Mine is :)
---
Black and gold PA paintjob? Might finally have an alternative for Blackbird that I can actually get.
---
Thank you, I was waiting for this.
---
My god, there is actually stuff in the camp section that I really want, like the Deco Rug Deathclaw and the Nuke Mobile.
---
AND HOLY SHIT! THOSE POWER ARMOR SKINS!
---
Autosetting the price would be tragic.
---
Bleed damage And nothing for twisted. That’s useless lol might as well just debuff everyone when they login while we are at it.
---
it's nice to just be able to buy it than farm for it. Killed myself a few times last night using the explosive handmade.  LOL not use to using explosive weapons yet
---
I wish...i never tamed a dog tho...so who knows! Its up to you to find out!
---
Actually... you don't even have to wait for the event to end... you can leave the event by going to pipboy then it's free game.
---
I'd honestly love faction systems to get expanded. Eg, opt in to build at special faction only locations, and fight for control (either with events, or pvp)
---
They said already vending is delayed till may lmfao
---
Especially fitting if it's an explosive variant lol
---
Player vending isn't missing, it was delayed to May 9th.
---
Obviously the vending machines weren't ready to be released yet.  We have a new cryptid to hunt at least!
---
They've been available this whole time at the grafton store, their spawn rate has just been made much rarer!
---
Would be nice to have a folder where the jukebox would pull songs from
---
Any word on a fix for the error when placing whole buildings in a different location? I've had different errors different times. I removed my stairs, my powered doors after being advised to and now it's given me some bullshit "furniture entry blocked" error. I spent hours building each nice house with high build limit stuff in there, and get even more irked every time it can't be placed elsewhere. I might just build some gimpy, unfurnished 4-storey dump in basic wood with stairs for the first 3 stories like everyone else does, they don't seem to have problems
---
You get cripple for twisted. Also 5% is still 50 damage when your dealing 1000.
---
How I would react: https://i.imgur.com/E19SiNw.mp4
---
The Wild Appalachia expansion seems to have resurrected this game from the dead. I stopped playing a week after launch and jumped back in during Faschnact Day. Much better now.
---
Like OP said, a lot of games with shared guild banks have assignable "ranks" for members. So for instance, the Guildmaster can set up a rank for "Recruits" or some such, with different variables being able to be set for the rank. Some games allow for a lot of specificity for guild bank privileges that could be adapted for the stash system: view only privileges, a limit on withdrawing (ie. player can only withdraw x number of things per day), individual tabs being locked to the rank (ie. you could have 1 tab of items open to all, but 2 tabs are locked to higher ranks).
---
I think the in-game UI would kinda blow for this, but if the guild set-up could be handled exclusively through their "social" overlay, it could be manageable for GM/Officers.
---
Then why don't you cure your Twisted Muscles and Talons from your character right now? Its literally the most brain-dead free source of damage in the game. Thats why it needs a nerf.
---
Yeah exactly, Currently buying atoms is still on the table, but only if they decide to actually listen to us and stick with it and not add anything non-cosmetic,if they simply go ahead and add the repair kits anyway then fuck em, not getting any atom money from me
---
Ok,  the West Side of the Gorge Bridge,  you can find the key to the room on the underside at Camden park on the coaster.  It's an easy lvl15 pa farm.  Just server hop till you have a full set.
---
it's not fixed yet
---
wait have the servers come back online already?
---
Why?  I will undercut anyone
---
servers are still down
---
I didn't see that
---
This^^
---
How would that be addressed in patch notes for a feature that hasn't come out yet.
---
It's still there, just an incredibly rare spawn, more so than it used to be!
---
I’ve thought about this quite a bit. Maybe Bethesda are hurting for cash a bit. I’m sure the reason for that would be a very complicated one. If that's the case, I don't understand why they don't make some affordable options that are cosmetic rather than this. I could definitely afford the repair kits. But, a lot of people don't have that kind of money. 
---
The whole repair kits thing I can live with. It's really not a big deal to me personally. Finding supplies and doing legwork is what makes Fallout, Fallout. Frankly the repair kits thing is a very odd thing to offer. People would actually pay money for that? 
---
However. If this continues the direction people fear, I will play something else and when other gamers ask me about Fallout, I will be brutally honest about how they lied right to our faces about PTW. I will lose all respect for this company and I will be forced to make an incredibly hard decision but I will make it on principal.
---
I want that sheepsquatch plushie irl :(
---
they just HAD to add these now I have to spend a couple weeks farming materials to make TWO more sets of Excavator ugh this is so good but also great
---
&gt; **Items:** Resources that glowing creatures drop as loot in nuke zones, such as Glowing Mass and Hardened Mass, are now instanced for all players who deal damage to those creatures. 
---
Thank you so much for this. I just spent the last 2 weeks crafting a ridiculous amount of ultracite ammo, and getting the mass / high rad fluids after nuking whitesprings in order to craft flux was a real pain since many players just loot all, and half of them end up dropping the mass / fluid somewhere or selling it to a vendor, when I really needed it for crafting flux.
---
These kinds of QoL changes are what give me faith that you guys are on the right track.
---
Principle of supply and demand.  Preset price controls reeks of communism.
---
Let me undercut my competitors.
---
Dog food has about a 5% chance of showing up with the Can Do perk, but dog food is easily found. I have 100 and live off the stuff. If you can't find any, take the Slow Metabolism to make go farther
---
Bethesda just wanted to keep an eye on you.
---
So is there any truth to the rumor that legendaries stop spawning after you server hop and farm the same location several times in a row? From your efforts, it looks like that rumor is fiction.
---
Like others have said, this kind of reinforces the fact that most legendary drops in this game are garbage.
---
I didn't think vendor caps were shared between players, so you could always sell your 1400 caps worth of supplies even if they didn't have much left for you to buy?
---
These are the kind of posts Bethesda wants to see, so they can fill the store with more shit. Please wake up and stop defending this. It is only going to get worse from here onwards.
---
Bethesda...why have you not addressed the issue of damage to players camps in this patch?
---
im on ps4
---
Yeah exactly, it’s the price you pay for playing in SURVIVAL. Or else what’s the point in two separate servers? I lose 420 caps a death but that’s the risk I take...
---
If AA doesn't apply to energy weapons, would it not apply to the gamma gun either?
---
I can't wait for private servers
---
yeah im afraid that is most likely the reason
---
Fallout meets Fortnite
---
There's a black variant that can be found in the atomic shop from a datamine someone did (Link here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bb9h79/datamined\_new\_atomic\_shop\_items\_0904\_patch\_1127/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bb9h79/datamined_new_atomic_shop_items_0904_patch_1127/)  ), but I believe that the white one will be able to obtain in-game, as it seems to be a key part of the quest.
---
I agree. It’s not pay to win. But pay for convenience is a scary slope to go down too. Repair kits are a very minor mechanic. But it sets precedent for gameplay mechanics that are not intended for player enjoyment, but to create problems and offer a solution.
---
Oh, until they backtrack, they are already off the table for me. They have said they plan on doing this, I'm going to take them at their word. And the fact they haven't said anything to try to mitigate it says to me they plan on doing this regardless of how much we speak out against it. So... well, I was even considering allowing myself to buy some atoms and maybe some extra atoms today if they introduced some cool stuff but I'll either wait to get the atoms or lose out if I can't get them in time. I'd say start boycotting them now... it's easier to convince them not to do it before they do it than after they are already in the game.
---
Yeah this whole process is still buggy as hell. My buildings are green all the time but still get random errors. Floating, interacting with object, w/e lame excuse it has. Then I take it all apart and build it in that same spot anyway one piece at a time and there's no problems. 
---
A lot of progress could still be made there.
---
Chicken Foot....
---
Stack. As in the effect of the same modification on both legs/arms doubling said effect.
---
It usually lasts until it's over.
---
Maybe but that's not how it was. Before this patch all vendors caps were each shared among players.
---
I agree that evil is not the right word for MODUS. It is still an alien AI mind collective with damaged programming and an army of military robots and the ability to make more. They (MODUS) are more than a little dangerous but they’re not GLaDOS. 
---
There’s no reason that it can’t rebuild the base and open it, it does have a nigh limitless workforce after all. I also see the possibility that the damage causes instability to MODUS and perhaps creates warring minds. It may have already happened and the MODUS we know has blocked I/O to the less... personable parts of its systems by keeping them blocked electronically and physically. That doesn’t mean those systems aren’t trying to restore their own access to the surface.
---
Neutral mobs will turn hostile after the first shot... Should be okay.
---
And i would rather use 1 shot to turn the group of mobs hostile than being forced to target friendly/neutral mobs all the time. SBQ fights were a pain in the ass because of this.
---
VERY BASIC loot, yes.  Not the same loot they'd get if you let them tag the creature first.
---
I'm embarrassed to say that one of my characters constantly walks around with his inventory full of PA frames full of every max level set combinations that looks good.  When you can reduce the weight to 2.5 it sounds like a good idea. Then you have 20 frames in you're inventory and realize it was a terrible idea.
---
Bethesda said last week that they were delaying player vending until patch 9(May 7th I believe). At first I was super bummed as I've been collecting a ridiculous amount of plans to showcase in my store, however this is probably the most important thing to not get wrong. Imagine if someone figured out a way to trick the game somehow and be able to steal peoples stuff. Might be the final nail in the coffin for some players if they were to lose a bunch of high end stuff and get nothing for it. I personally will be dipping my toe in the vending machine water before committing anything high end to my vending machines.
---
  Yes, Bethesda games have bugs. The trick is to learn how to navigate around and avoid the bugs. I've learned patience is the key with Fallout 76.
---
While I understand the reasoning, I really hope not. Current vendors weren't put in place to provide a way for them to properly resell player made food items. The sell function and the adding to the vendors available items seems very barebones. For example, until a few patches ago, If someone sold a weapon to a MODUS vendor station and more than 1 other person is at one of the four terminal vendors, they could each buy a copy, effectively duping the item at the cost of its caps price. 
---
To fix this, they first locked down every terminal except one, then in a later patch simply had MODUS not relist many items you sell to it. Rather brutish maintenance, but it goes to show that the vendor mechanics for selling were built around the idea of train station/single vendor mechanics. What's available for purchase in the vendors "natural" inventory takes the brunt of the extra programming/mechanics, while selling is set up as more of a cap exchange/dump.
---
In explaining why they had to push back the vendors, they said tongue in cheek that the current vendors weren't happy with sharing their mechanics and it needs some more fleshing out. Basically saying that getting Player Vending working is taking quite a bit more rework than a simple copy/paste of vendor mechanics assigned to your stash with you being able to filter what's available. That would be the "logical" and most simple method to do it, but code and bugs are a lot more stubborn than that, so they have to chop it all up to make it work in harmony with everything else.
---
It would be a little odd to release player vendors when half of the people looking to roleplay commercial locations want to make a bar/cafe. It'd be ridiculous if people who wanted to sell food specifically had to run around the entire time they're playing cooking more food to keep stocked while what they've made spoils due to there of course not being a line out the door at anyone's CAMP.
---
It'd be silly not to take that into account with so many heads in the think tank for development.
---
**No!** ... those are still useful to high level players (or lower level players with Gatling Lasers). They can be "recharged" by converting them to Ultracite Fusion Cores. They recharge to full. A bug perhaps? In any case, you need Violet Flux to do it, but they do wonders with a Furious Prime Gatling Laser. 
---
Don't drop them in a fissure... just leave them in WS, or Watoga. If you comeback and find them missing and see a guy with an Ultracite Prime Gatling Laser roasting a Scorchbeast... it might be me, and thank you.
---
L u l z
---
*FACEPALM* 
---
My bad bud. I thought it was done in the last patch. LoL
---
&gt;Usually it’s the lower levels who don’t know the etiquette yet or the level 200+ 
---
I'm level 200 plus, but I don't go to the event  to farm legendary enemies.   I do it to farm steel by scrapping weapons dropped by the miners. 
---
I don't concern myself with the legendary enemies, just tag em and let someone else kill them.  10 times out of ten anything they drop is going to the vendor because level 40 and below gear is kind of worthless to me.
---
I agree, this is very disappointing
---
Now imagine a raider armor with a raider skin.
---
I don't why y'all are always using pvp as your go to counter arguement for the repair kit situation. There's only two issues that people are having problems with. 
---
1. It's the idea of what it is and what it may lead to for future atomic shop items.
---
2. (Still being debated) The repair kits may be pushed so players can buy them for upcoming raids. Obviously, we don't know how hard raids will be so this is still being discussed.
---
Either way, no one is saying repair kits will win you all the pvp battles. People are saying they don't like the idea of ingame items being put in the atomic shop. It's not pay to win, but it's still something a lot of players are uncomfortable with.
---
I will sell plans and misc item for super cheap since they are easy to come by. Weapons armour is case by case. Setting our own price by supply and demand is simple commerce. Hopefully they will let us set our own prices. It would be more realistic.
---
That hasn't changed, you still need to kill 10 people. Just the amount transferred has been reduced.
---
That's true, I guess it is better that they wait and get it right.
---
I'm so irritated.  The article on the Bethesda site regarding Dailies not respawning hasn't bene updated in weeks.  Meanwhile I'm down to Cop a Squatter, 1 Camden Park, and Biv for anything 'Daily' that's remotely worth doing.  The rest is hoping certain Events spawn or I have to server hop.
---
Best to ask here because if anyone has the answer it's going to be a bunch of random redditors.
---
well I would agree if they where to continue how they started with the Atomshop......add some "normal" items into the game and fancy versions of them in the Atomshop so all players have the same access to the same items just some look a bit more fancy
---
They said it in the inside the vault, this has been said for over two weeks, player vending wont come till early may
---
It Toad-ally has to be from the new questline.
---
If I find a nice looking camp I may hang out and use the facilities (so to speak) then leave a bag of goodies as a thank you.
---
People just do things differently I guess 🙂
---
Yep, already seen a couple comments asking about the repair kits or wanting a statement from the community managers.
---
I am the same but with ammo and chems. oh, stimpacks now only weigh .1, I guess it is fine to hold 200+ of them
---
Shit you beat me. Best answer here^^
---
Oh ok didn't think of that
---
Fuccboi gold X-01 helmet. Yes pls.
---
&gt; What do you guys think?
---
That with the cost of death being lower that there will be more people to play survival and kill
---
My first experience at whitesprings was a nuke when I was exploring nearby at level 14.I saw the notice and went toward the blast (contrary to my elementary school duck and cover training).
---
A guy saw me near the train station and dropped a hazmat suit for me. I thanked him, put it on, and went in to the blast area. After a bit, I saw him inside as I crept around. He gestured me up on the flowerbed by the pool, and told me to stay there. Dropped a stack of molotovs, told me to hit each group with 1 molotov.  
---
Then proceeded to drag group after group of glowing ghouls over there, where I would burn them before he took them out. I hit 30 that day, and had more legendaries than I could do anything with.  
---
He told me pick the ones I need for my build goal, and suggested I drop the rest in the cooler- which I did.
---
A great day. I learned the etiquette of the golfclub nuke, and had a ton of fun.
---
You can swap in and out hacking and picking as needed.
---
Ballistic weapon type builds are all fine except pistols which kinda suck.
---
VATS asks a lot of you, but produces great ammo conservation in non-SBQ scenarios.
---
You don’t need a ton of perks for power armor, pretty much you only wear it in nuke zones.
---
Its hard to boycot something I haven't done yet anyway, lol, was more thinking for the future
---
Or even the odd couple of military ammo bags when your low on ballistic fiber.
---
New content will be overlaid on the map, so new map expansions (Excluding underground areas), but most will require that you interact with a certain thing (e.g a poster) to actually start the quest. For the Nukashine quest, any Train station will have the poster to activate the quest(Or from the Atomic shop to get the poster for your CAMP), but for Lying Lowe, you'll need to head to Lewisburg and find the poster to interact with (Believe you can also get the poster from the atomic shop oh and both are free).
---
Agreed. Awareness is a good thing.
---
It isn't a "PvP mode" It is called survival. The best way humans survive is by working together and not chasing a 1,2,3 circle of a level 14 player that has been alive for "1h"
---
BLUBLZRedeux
---
Yes but I won't lose 3k caps in under 15 mins. Meaning caps found in the world and gained from kills will be easier to hold onto.
---
Ok these are fucking amazing.
---
People post inside the vault stuff on here
---
It would be cool to have weekly clan objectives that reward unique things, like the named weapons in survival mode
---
I don’t really think there were a lot of people exploiting/cap farming anything. 
---
I’d earn money from kills, go to adventure, spending it all on ammo from the player market, then, go back to Adventure. 
---
Gonna shoot people just as often now. Probably will warm the same amount because less people will have 0 caps on them.
---
Really excited about the survival server changes. I may end up paying there exclusively now. I was 50/50 before.
---
TSE lever action - "Lever 2: Explosive Boogaloo"
---
Gamma guns aren't energy weapons, AA works with the ballistic damage but not the rad damage
---
I'm just suggesting an additional mechanic to go on-top of sentinal. That doesn't mean i dont understand this games mechanics. You know how easy it is to tank the SBQ with sentinal? With my suggestion it would be a little bit harder since you would have to attack only after you block her attacks.
---
&gt; What do you guys think? 
---
That people will stop stashing all their caps before heading into Survival
---
So...repair kits are in game? Didn’t see anything about it in patch notes
---
Enclave vendors don't get a copy in the Whitespings
---
Is anyone getting unbanned or could bethesda at least say something?
---
I like a molotov. No blast to scatter enemies, and it persists for new ones entering the fray.
---
I like that silver excavator skin.
---
Thank for for understanding the immediate circumstance isn’t the major issue but the gateway to a dismal land of monetized anything and everything. 
---
Truly appreciate your ability to see outside the box. ❤️
---
Damn, guess I just missed it then.

Stash: The Stash container preview window has been removed, and the transfer menu must be opened to view the contents of the Stash.
---
Dev Note: This type of preview window makes it quick and easy to loot a few items from containers you find, but it isn’t the best way to cycle through your entire Stash. Additionally, removing this window from the Stash affords us a small performance improvement. As a result, we’ve removed this window in favor of opening the full transfer menu to view your Stash inventory.
---
At first, I didn't like this but I really haven't used the preview window to grab stuff since I started stuffing my stash with unused ammo because it always shows that first. This makes sense.
---
I do wish they would have upped the limit again though to "make up" for the loss of the window, since they mentioned how this gives them a performance boost.
---
They mention how the current fermenting works (item is still in stash, but marked as reserved) in the patch notes and that they will be using similar ways for some upcoming items. Sounds like the display items will still be "in your stash" and count as part of your weight limit even when on display.
---
You removed Kinect support?!? You monsters!!! Seriously, thank you. When I unplug my headset I didn't like the additional open mic. This is good.
---
So much good shit from that datamine yet they felt the need to put repair kits in the store?
---
I like this. Pay to win is bad enough, but pay to play the game and then have to pay again to access all aspects of the game sucks. At the very least they could be less stingy giving out atoms.
---
I had said the same thing in another thread. The thing is, they can't just decide to break a major promise by sneaking things in casually haha. They need to be direct and discuss the matter.
---
Also, if they want to post more enticing items, they could always try better cosmetics before starting in with the QOL sales. Far too much of the shop consists of overpriced and/or uncool items, like multiple variants of sleeping bags and beds... xD
---
I think it's just random.
---
if that one's a limited time thing i'm gonna be so disappointed, i've been waiting for stuff exactly like that for months now
---
I made ~1,000 caps off of a level ~490 dude last week (and like 50 stimpacks and a bobblehead) and so I'm pretty happy about the drop levels. This just feels like they're going from one extreme to another just to see what happens. Something in the middle (#caps = #levels) feels about right
---
Not all of them have a clean version, usually if the clean version is in the atom shop its not in the game. Theres only a few clean stuff in the game from things not in the shop like the spacesuit, straightjacket etc
---
This is my double barrel his name is BOOFBOOF!
---
Exactly, there were only ever 2-3 survival lobbies on PS4, and sometimes those wouldn’t even be close to full. I expect more people to give it a go now.
---
I don't think it's the first time they've mislabelled the various reactive and reflective type armor response features as legendary affixes on armor.  First time I remember was when they reduced the reflected damage when the player received "Slaps".  The player would receive a slap, but then it would reflect damage based on full Melee, usually killing the slapper and making the person slapped get a bounty.
---
So it seems to me like now that they fixed that previously, they are making reflected damage no longer initiate unwanted PVP.  And have just again mislabelled those effects.
---
I figured since people here play the game, they've seen the servers go down for maintenance before and have a rough ball park figure how long it usually last. But, hey, sorry to inconvenience you, mate.
---
Display cases in future updates coming
---
That whole quest is buggy as hell. Rarely progresses  when on the start island for me, enemies get spawned underground, and now your glitch? It's like they tested it once, got lucky and labelled it **perfect**
---
Will wood armor still provide enough protection to survive if an enemy ends up detecting me?
---
So many great changes. Looking forward to playing tonight.  
---
Also: Cringing at the thought of what changed item names we might see in future Twitch and YouTube videos.
---
A rifle might be able to peak at 75% armor piercing and 1500 damage. Since you got titan killer and perforating mags to get to 75% leaving you with a bloodied weapon to use. 
---
A shotgun cant hit 75% armor piercing and 1500+ damage.
---
Didnt even think about that. Youre talking about the ones outside the Poseidon power plant workshop?
---
The dungeon next week looks great as well. Very excited for that.
---
This is it! This is the thread that will convince Bethesda to remove repair kits from the atom store!
---
the douche minority tends to stand out in your memory. you may make 6 Uranium Fever runs that day with 20 people, but that one douche stands out in your memories.
---
Ok thanks that's what I wanted to know.
---
Wow.  Lot's of great looking things here.  I'm digging all the PA skins, the sheepsquatch outfit, and all the skins for the bar and furniture.  Absolutely can't wait for these.  If only we could get the deathclaw PA skin or a super mutant themed one.  This leaves me hopeful though.
---
It never will because you dont have blackbird 😘
---
There's a (holotape player)[http://i.imgur.com/dnfWbeP.jpg] in the intro of Fallout 4 that seems to have the purpose of playing music holotapes.  
---
Maybe we should get one in Fallout 76, and the game should spawn some music holotapes we can choose to play.
---
It's because it's so unique and never before been said!
---
Sarcasm makes me wet.
---
Atari 2600 master race checking in.

---
Killing players in survival mode now doesn’t even cover the costs of the ammo used to kill them.., This is stupid Bethesda
---
Why didn't we think of this?
---
So does that mean there's no benefit to having 2 optimised bracers ect..
---
Mjölnir
---
That’s common error. It doesn’t change odds at all from 50% so it’s .5+.5+.5+.5+.5 all over 5 = .5, not .5^5 = ~.03
---
A whole reddit account dedicated to this one subject this is the hero we needed
---
Ya. They are on the radio towers too
---
UPVOTE THIS 🙏🏼
---
I have mixed feelings about it.
---
I’m no pvp expert (yet). I do have a min maxed rifle build however and have a decent set of legendary handmades. 
---
This lead me to having a super nerve wracking and edge of my seat experience. Is that a red dot a mole rat, a lvl 79, or a lvl 300 about to take away 200 of my caps in a single shot. 
---
And most times, I came out with an extra 500 caps or so, so faired fairly well. After hearing the news initially, I was disappointed.
---
I did read an argument on here that made me reconsider: those dudes who are playing who do not have caps to pay when they are killed. The biggest criticism I had about survivor was killing a lvl 200 a couple times before noticing I was not getting any caps from them. Only for them to kill me after that and claim a full 200+ caps from me. I guess this nerf eliminates this problem for the most part, but perhaps there would have been a better solution, such as penalizing the damage output of those unable to pay their death fines.
---
Will do
---
Honestly I’ve refused to put anymore time into fallout 76. The direction this specific fallout is going, to me, is the completely opposite direction I wanted to see fallout go. I always say this but who actually ever asked for a pvp version of fallout with a micro transaction store? Literally nobody ever that I’ve known wanted this, the borderlands approach would have been exponentially better and more successful of a business model in my honest opinion.
---
Thanks, Broseph.
---
Another reddit user who knows exactly how to fix a game without creating unforeseen issues with those fixes!! I wonder why none of you have jobs developing games??
---
Ikr? Someone even found the image for the Repair kit, so it seemed like the complete riot here did't do anything!
---
But yeah the Atomic shop is getting some hefty new good lookin' content, all they need to do is keep that up and they'll make cash for days.
---
What repair kits? /s
---
how about a vending machine we can put our stuff for sale in, which anyone can buy or make an offer on. I dont know whether anyone, on the map, has something to sell,or not.would the server recources allow this ? hmmm - and across platforms. - possibly an addition to the atom shop.  world wide trade.
---
How does item population work though? Doesn’t the game instance similar loot for everyone from the overseer stash? How do you know they actually get it?
---
Thanks.
---
The plain text in those framed Pickaxe Pilsner signs hints to me that the text will be editable!
---
Anyone else think so?
---
That deathclaw rug is so dope too.
---
 **Insult Bot:** The Insult Bot will now insult you. 
---
Life is now complete.
---
Amazing patch, I bet I've wasted at least 5 hours of game play pulling all 9 PAs out of my stash and then lining them up like fat kids at the candy store.
---
set a low damage weapon up to fast switch. Open by spraying with that level 5 auto 10mm, then after everyone has a hit in- switch and open up with the bad boy to wipe em out.  
---
You are going to be encumbered 10 minutes in anyway, why not carry the extra weapon and ammo to do it better?
---
Tried that, no go.
---
I am doing a full uninstall and reinstall to see if that helps.
---
These replies 😂😂😂
---
Also, it's his first post and he even CREATED his reddit account just so he can tell Beth how it is. Well, they can't stay silent any longer.
---
Bravo, good sir! I applaud you!
---
Higher level players often have an abundance of junk, plans, and chems. If you're approached by a higher level player, don't automatically run.  I often drop stimpacks, weapons, plans, and junk to help noobs. 
---
If someone is jumping around a paper bag(or other container) or is shooting it, CHECK THE CONTAINER!
---
It’s an end game item my dude earned by killing the end game boss. Or luckily aquired from rads
---
For reference to anyone who may care as much as I do, here are the Clean/Pristine items I've found:
---
* Clean Steelworker Uniform: Sold by vendor at Camden Park
---
* Pristine Miner Uniform: Not 100% sure where I found it, but it was somewhere in Ash Heap in one of those locker rooms  just on a shelf
---
* Clean Space Helmet: I've gotten this to spawn multiple times in Charleston in the clothing shop
---
Since its unclear what is even available in-game, I'd love for anyone who has clean stuff to share what the item even *is*. :(
---
You were one-shotted over and over and over at a workshop?  That just means you didn’t learn the first time.
---
I'd love animal companions. Like ESO.
---
I was promised player vending on April 9 according to the roadmap! WHERE IS IT?!?
---
That's an X-01 skin to rival Blackbird
---
Good luck it is infuriating when this game doesn’t work but it is worth persevering changing settings reinstalling all that good stuff :-)
---
I give it about another 30 minutes based on previous patches
---
I just don't like having to keep all of that acid around. I was keeping 25 stacks in my stash, but decided there is enough from just killing and walking around that I didn't need the additional headache of finding a lab and smelting it.
---
I keep 10 stacks of acid and 2 stacks of cloth... just in case I need to make some gunpowder. Most of the time, if I do one run in Grafton, or West Tek I end up with 50-60 gunpowder.
---
I want that nukashine keg
---
I don’t see them in the patch notes. Or am I blind? Did they abort the mission?
---
For survival, can you add a small time before disbanding the "team" at the end of the event, yesterday I was doing uranium fever colecting steel, whit another random player, when 4 players came shooting, at the end of the event, as soon the "team up" endended we were killed by a inv player (no chamaleon or stealth bow) we only saw his red arrow and instakilled all of us whit his  explosive shotgun, it wasnt really pleasant.
---
30 minutes to spawn, 5 minutes to kill. Uranium fever is up a lot more often than the queen. If both are up this makes sense, but how often is that a dilemma you face?
---
and we also need fucking SHELVES TO BE WORKING SO WE CAN PUT OUR STUFF ON SHELVES BUT NOOO LET BETHESDA PUSH THAT SHIT UNTIL PATCH 13
---
Last maintenance was finished by now. That help?
---
Perfect storm is incindiary. But that's the only one I've seen.
---
I like this idea.  Hope it's in consideration.  Have a few mini games in here like Final Fantasy usually incorporates.
---
PC player here.  I am not having this problem.  Playing with no mods.
---
That combined with the 25% of caps dropping will make me play. Being level 340 and losing 640 caps on death, plus having to mule ALL of my aid items off of my character, just made it too cumbersome.
---
You know what's funny? I went to WVU in Morgantown! I'm a W.V. native, and that's where this happened! lol. So in a sense it already WAS in W.V. lol
---
...
---
Not really. I like any dystopian wasteland as an escape, favoring zombie ones.
---
I try to do it once every time a new patch drops. I haven't had the other bugs happen only zero rewards after the event. I guess I'll find out when it's back up
---
&gt; Despite my disappointment that player vending has been put back till May
---
I'd rather have it late than to dump 100 chems in a vending machine to lose or dupe them
---
I would say they’re “small but noticeable “ if that makes any sense! Although the constant need for cobalt flux to make ultracite 45’s is a pain, overall, I wouldn’t put it on my main, but for a backup SBQ gun, you may find its worth it.
---
From past experience, within the next hour or 2 but that could change since it's a large update.
---
Is this game worth my time yet?
---
No I attempted to fight back, only to realize after a several kills that the PVP is severely broken/unbalanced.
---
There is no mentioning of player vending??
---
I disabled voice chat outside of teams. I'm not there to listen to you talk shit.
---
You shoot someone with sent 3 times and they are dying. And I get staggered by the queen a lot making me take damage so I really don’t think you solo her or kill her at all for that matter. It’s pretty easy to be one hit by her. Especially when running a bloodied build
---
I hope you croak here soon.
---
I have been buying all of the plans. I only have some remaining power armor plans to get in Watoga, and Excavator (Grafton/Camden Park). I never buy materials I can find. Caps are too rare.
---
Lvl40 are junk. Just wait till u get the god roll on your lvl40 item..then what the duck. 😂😂
---
### soon™
---
Bahaha! Perfect!
---
I have 2 cap stash bobble heads, I'm gonna be rich 😂
---
So if I have 2 Kinetic Servos or Optimized Servos.. there is no point?
---
Is there a source for this information? Because there seems to be a lot of misinformation about the topic.. the very little it's been brought up.
---
They moved the first one, The Burrows, under Harper's Ferry, to next week, April 16th.
---
I have no real info, but speaking from experience I now see the "this account lack the required entitlements" instead of "the servers are undergoing maintenance" which usually mean that the servers are ..up'ish, but not quite playable just yet.
---
Nope. I can’t wait for society to collapse in real life.
---
Ya. It's nice without all of the crybaby complainers. Once they come back it will be shit again.
---
Similar results but never tracked either,amazing job!  
---
That said, 2 weeks ago when there was the legendary weekly challenge in survival, of course, my results dropped about 200%  
---
Didn't even finish the quest, ran through it ... maybe 75 times?  Ended with 17 Legendary Kills
---
And still under maintenance, 11:18 CST.
---
https://www.gamerevolution.com/guides/522297-fallout-76-1-13-update-patch-notes-ps4-xbox-one-pc?amp
---
You're making a very, very rash assumption by assuming the game is going to work once the servers come back up.
---
I trust my guts. If you didn't like it before reaching lvl 50, you'll hardly like it now.
---
It's refined but it's the same game.
---
Melee on top for so long enjoy your timeout!
---
Yaaaassss bitch! ThnxX luv ♡♡
---
1. Put a lock on your water purifiers, or any resource at your camp. This is just camp resources 101. Press F while looking at it in build mode to lock. Picking it gives a bounty.
---
2. All's fair in love and war, but wasting your time repeatedly running at this person, dying, and giving them emotes shows some serious saltiness on your part. It's normal - you aren't used to being killed in survival yet. Give it a few more play sessions and you won't be so miffed about it.
---
I'm creating another 4 accounts so I can upvote your brilliant ingenuity for solving this world-wide problem! Thanks so much!
---
I believe that's coming in the May update, they had to delay it last minute from this one.
---
# #kG_Ghosts
---
I don't see it as pay to win. These kits only repair items to 100% (Most pdople can do 200% at a bench, and 150% kits drop from things like the SBQ). And to be honest, if you need repair kits to be viable then one needs to learn equipment maintainence. These items in no way make you faster or stronger or give an advantage over other players. 
---
In order for an item to be considered pay to win then it would need to be Atom Shop only perks or weapons or armor that give an edge over another player. Personally I would rather use a workbench to get to 200% and have the item need repairs less often and get the stat bonuses. These are in no way "pay to win"...
---
Get the video and put a ticket in to Bethesda so they know to fix it
---
I thought that there was nothing more annoying than the Whitespring farmers until the Watoga farmer emerged.
---
It's so annoying that some turd with no life runs around for 3 hours shooting fish in a barrel and then when I spawn in the game is broken and nothing spawns anymore. Even worse is that this turd has been killing everything including the non legendaries.
---
agreed but that doesn't stop me wanting to cry lol I feel a bit like being told on Christmas eve that actually you can't open your presents till January
---
9/10 post.  Would read again.  10/10 if fewer words **were** used.
---
Yes Yes yES!
---
Uranium Fever would be such a hotbed for player team up and communication if the mobs would spawn at lvl 50.
---
If it's just something you're only using for the SBQ fight then yeah... If it's just your regular day to day gun then no. Ammo is expensive and if your a functional sniper you should be one shoting most things anyway, no extra damage needed.
---
They add so many great power armor skins and outfits yet screw up their positives by adding this to the store.
---
I honestly don't get it
---
I'd say the patch notes were pretty good. I'm happy by the amount of bug and exploit fixes seen. Not to mention, the entire new questline and all the content we got today.
---
Danke schoen, darlin', danke schoen.
---
I find them useful on characters I am leveling up. Especially as fillers until a 45 or 50 one comes up- which can be 20 levels or more, like weightless armor for snipers.
---
Interesting theory and I would love it to be correct. It could of course be that one if the Devs kids thought it would be funny lol
---
You can have only one at a time
---
The deathclaw easter eggs are interesting
---
Yes, don't forgot the insult bot was fixed
---
No mods either. Just exiting to main menu gives no problem ,but totally exiting the game cause the game to freeze and a error message pops up causing me to ctrl+alt+del to be able to close the game.
---
What there’s a robot that follows you around insulting you? That’s awesome lol
---
Giving this a 3/10 it didn't reference anything I considered interesting other than Insult Bot getting fixed.
---
Nothing says honesty like starting a post with "to be honest".
---
Bethesda, arm Insult Bot with a Gatling laser and high hp so he can tank for me.
---
You were so thorough in your analysis it’s hard to argue
---
cool
---
This has been an issue since the game launched. Fallout 76: The social anti-social experience!
---
I hope that the dungeons and raids will be much better for loot and the go-to-farm-spot, but we'll see next week.
---
I'm surprised no one has been offended by my character lol. https://imgur.com/gallery/6WVxuTc
---
&gt;Weapon renaming
---
&gt;Faction Vendors at whitesprings
---
BLESS
---
I agree, much more comprehensive than past patch notes have been
---
How long
---
Wow thats great xD
---
One day u will understand little one. 😂😂
---
And it takes 18mins to launch a nuke. 😉
---
My atoms are not safe around those camp items... :o
---
As a result, we’re moving player vending to Patch 9, which is currently slated for release in May. [Source](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eQmVlhbjlkX0GzGb7DB3j/inside-the-vault-looking-beyond-patch-8-april-4-2019)
---
Thanks!! Do you know where the spawn is?
---
See lol.  I knew I forgot something.
---
This is so freaking LIT
---
Yeah I feel like the Talons and Twisted muscles thing was a bit too much. It just looks like he wants to buff power armor and guns/stagger. 🤔 In survival mode the meta is literally just ranged weapons, melee kinda became super weak as I expected because no "slap" damage and baiting them to hit you back, that's literally only reason why melee was super "strong" in pvp.
---
Yeah spawns all the time for me lol like one out of three logins
---
Am I the only one excited about the hunter outfit? I'm going to put on all that bright orange gear and hunt down a 12 foot tall death bringing sheep, but safety first. Got to make sure other hunters don't mistaken me for the monster that pushes trees over because it was just in it's way.
---
Sorry, I forgot to say I'm on pc. If you are too, then I apologize and don't have any half-good tips after all :P
---
By far the most important change
---
Nothing in my post, or the OP's original post, commented about the effects of said mods.  I was asking for clarification on the question.  And I said that Mods stack in your inventory, and they cannot be applied more than one per mod slot on your power armor.
---
That tactical ops outfit is awesome. I like the fur coat too, but wish one of the shots showed how the female (non maniquen) form looks.  
---
All the bar stuff looks really neat. Hope they're not too expensive, or exclusive to a bundle.
---
Oooh... now that is a thought. Like a death angel... or angel of death giving the weak the means to protect themselves and not even know it's not part of the game. I like it.
---
Yes it has good points and I'm all for recognising effort but why on Earth was camp damage not addressed for players in pacifist mode or any mode for that matter...this was and still is, one of the biggest requests by members/ players...very disappointed that this rumbles on again
---
Just like the prize bot..I shoot the insult bot on site.
---
Agree.  It was a pain because I always had at lead 2-3 shotguns in slots 2-3-4.
---
It wouldn’t fix to 200% condition ever. Thanks for the link, thank goodness now insult bot will finally insult me.
---
Im happy because now I won't have to create a new character and won't lose nearly 500 caps a fight
---
See you in Appalachia
---
I do not know.  My comments were not about the effects of the mods themselves.
---
They don't drop fusion cores. I've killed every robot in Whitesprings and never had a single piece of steel drop.
---
Yeah and waiting 6 months for Bethesda to fix anything is just as good right?
---
He wanted to be connected to the Kovac-Muldoon and the Sugargrove surveillance facility, and he, via you, achieved this. He also seems to want to rebuild an Enclave presence on the surface, even if it's just via robots and the occasional member. A Sugargrove terminal has reports on several interesting projects, including a radiation shield, weaponized EMPs, and a number of others, most of them unsuccessful. But he may have ways to modify them, and use them for his own purposes. I'm not sure what his end game is, though.
---
Patchnotes say they fixed the assaultron head, both cell usage and damage not ramping when charged.
---
This is a very good and extensive patch. 
---
I've put the game down around 2 months ago due to being fed up with performance issues and overall bugs, but I still love the game and hope to return to it in November, a whole year after release to see how it changed and improved.
---
With more patches like these, with these long lists of big fixes I really do think the game can reach that level of polish I've always dreamed of for this game.
---
What’s the hype around blackbird? I have it but I never use it, wish I could refund, it’s bland. Sure the helmet is cool for the X01, but I prefer the hotrod paint on the helmet, and pieces.
---
 plus the whole set is beautiful.
---
Holy crap! That Raider Excavator armor and that gimmicked Assaultron helmet look bad ass! Definitely getting those two.
---
weapon skin: camera.  
---
Neat. &lt;click&gt;
---
I understand that but as I mentioned, it's pretty much impossible to get everything done in these patches.  If I'm not mistaken, they said it was going to be released in Patch 9.
---
when they hit 0% they get deleted. i like to imagine my character throwing them into any fissure site they walk past
---
Haven't played since the first week of launch, so all these changes seem like a foreign language to me. But I'm glad the game is getting all this support. Plan on jumping back in soon. A
---
I'm liking the skull mask and spec ops underarmor
---
Has it been in the game the whole time?  Never seen it
---
I'd be happy with more to buy with said caps.  Some form of end game purpose aside from collecting flux. Been playing about 3 months and im already out of plans to buy or gear to hunt, places to explore and so on.  Now I just login, walk in circles then log back out.
---
Yes you are very right. I'm just gonna be sad that I can't make 5k caps in 1 hour of gunfighting.  I will just have to try harder.
---
See, THAT'S how you motivate people (including me) to drop cash on this game, not stupid repair kits that no one asked one.
---
Yeah after the second time I immediately just murder him
---
I'm thinking about buying 2-3 more copies of the game just to support this :D
---
Now imagine a raider skin floor rug.
---
It's not about vanity, it's about usefulness. 
---
Scattered legendary armour pieces that work well together in a set? Rename them all with the same appropriate prefix. 
---
Many legendary pieces after a long day at Whitesprings? Label the ones you're keeping as "keep" for later use or to eventually trade go the legendary vendor, and label the junk as $ so it's all at the top of the list for sale. Same goes with regular armour, guns, etc 
---
You can also rename power armour frames to tell them apart. I shouldn't have to tell you how useful that is
---
I'm sure there are people that will name their TSE to "EXcAlIbUr_loL" but they wouldn't be making the most of this new feature
---
Holy shit, it's over. No more repair kits, He has spoken.
---
It's like real life for me..... LOL
---
I think I'll go to the Whitespring.......ohh great there is people there looks like I'm going to Harpers Ferry until those people leave.
---
## Your Ticket Has Been Submitted
---
### Thanks for submitting your question. Your ticket number is: 190409-001939
---
Is it only animals or can I have a super mutant and name him Brutus as a pet?
---
It is a lots of fun. 
---
Normally I find while I blast away with my .50 explosive at her the very low level players will help keep the queens forces of my and other heavy weapon players backs. There are times we need to help clean up around us. 
---
Just ammo wise cost me about 3 000- 5 000 bullets just on her depending how many other big guns help.
---
I got disco ball plans from Grahmn
---
Yea I got both but I use blackbird only for my xo1 and hot rod for my t45. It's a flex to have tbh. Nothing more. Haha
---
I don't think so but honestly I don't know when it was added. I first saw him about a month and half ago
---
They may have to split it by server type if that becomes a problem. Over in Adventure, VATS has been targeting friendlies first, making events with friendly robots/turrets/other players impossible for rifle VATS builds. Why target the scorchbeasts raining hell upon us when there are things that will fail the quest for everyone should they take too much damage? Spin 180 degrees and shoot that with crit damage! Army of glowing and diseased scorched? Shoot the friendly player! Escorting this bot across a wasteland? Kill him with one shot while wolves charge towards you!
---
I'm super excited for this because I was honestly looking at options for changing my perks and main weapon type. If it doesn't work over in Survival, they should kill it for those servers and let it be a difference between the two game styles.
---
Understood but surely that was a priority? So many complaints
---
Cheers dude. Thats a tad disappointing, My stash is full of shit ive been collecting to sell 😂😂 really looking forward to player vending.
---
"Toadeye you found a toad eye on a lvl 5 rad toad,..." I'll see myself out
---
Pool or darts would be great, and I'd like to add - Horseshoes!  i dont know why but the fallout atmosphere just reminds me of playing horse shoes at my child hood camp ground lol
---
Will people announce that they have the Insult Bot similar to how they announced Grahm and the Lemonade stand?
---
You will take your ptw items and ugly skins and you will like it!
---
Ahh. A douche. There is a thread talking about your kind. Go back to xbox and squeak no more.
---
All this shiny new furniture and no clean floors and walls to put behind them.  
---
But dem power armor skins.
---
Because Sheepsquatch is a real cryptid in WV, also "sheepacabra" is a little redundant.
---
I gave a guy 150 rounds of .308 and he gave me a surprise... 25 purified water. I paid it forward in Flatwoods and made a bunch of Stimpaks (4x + super duper) and left them in the Overseer's chest. XP for me, and goodied for the new players.
---
Farm for ~~Legendaries~~ players at Whitesprings. With all the vendors being there it means that it will be more heavily populated.
---
weird ..he didn't have it yesterday when I traded with him.
---
Some CAMP plans are still random on the vendors.  So you may have to hit up grahm multiple times to get the Disco Ball.
---
I cannot remember where I found the electric chair.  May have been a workshop reward for me.
---
ooo i cant wait to see the bars or restuarants people make with those new items
---
&gt;Insult Bot: The Insult Bot will now insult you
---
They said a bit ago that vending was delayed. Your fault for not knowing
---
rather generous
---
Yeah, grahm usually has the disco ball, and I saw the electric chair for sale at the Sutton Station a couple of days ago (makes sense that a Raider bot sells it).
---
Northern area of the Mire is tailor made for such a beast. I literally think of HogZilla whenever I walk around there.
---
Wait, What!? 
---
Fallout 4, the single-player game, is Pay-2-Win?
---
Please, tell me more about how you gain an advantage over nonexistent players, in a game designed for only 1 player.
---
aww crap, I had hoped all plans were "permanent" after that patch some time ago, well this explains things for me then. Thanks for your reply.
---
But ur name is very fitting. Anger management issues much. 😂😂
---
This isn’t going to speed that up. Lol
---
:( you’re right
---
^ Food: The rate at which Food spoils is now more consistent.
---
Does anyone else find this particular wording particularly concerning?
---
We've known for a few weeks now that food is spoiling much faster, and the wording above doesn't necessarily indicate they've improved it at all.
---
Yup.  Many complaints.  Same as the excessive amount of aid items dropping in survival and the amount of caps being lost upon death.  You are right about it being a priority thing.  Looks like they figured the priority was addressing the survival mode issues first.  I'm fine with them at least acknowledging that they will be making those C.A.M.P. changes in a future update.  Hopefully, they'll stick with Patch 9 or at least next weeks update with the new dungeon coming in.
---
Guild or atleast faction aligning features would be nice! would love to know who sides with the BOS
---
I don't know where to start... - This is an impressive changelog.
---
I'm glad you work so hard on FO76.  Thank you, BGS.
---
" Increased the volume of the Alpine Horn’s sound effects when activated. " This is clearly the best fix.
---
Lmao you sound like a dude I play with. Honestly that was our other cap farm, outside of vendor runs. Having to kill multiple people to get 100 caps now, I'm not sure.....Decreasing dropped items I'm fine with. I would pick up like 100 stimpaks lol.
---
Yeah. You used to have to server hop until you found a kill heavy server. Hopefully every server can be that now.
---
Electric chair is Raiders vendors. Mirror ball is Grahm. Both don't always have it in stock.
---
All of these look awesome but tbh I'm a little disappointed at the size of the bar.
---
I wish that instead of one whole piece, it was a set of 3 pieces consisting of two "corner" pieces and a straight "Middle" piece
---
I'm hoping to do a tank build so I can assist in taking down one. I'm only level 37 though, and the build I'm going for requires level 91 at least. It'll be fun though, I'm sure.
---
I got lucky and found the electric chair plans at either the Overseer’s Camp or Flatwoods Church. Thanks whoever left it there 👍
---
Whats arnour?
---
The ability to rename my various power armor chassis is a \*great\* quality of life improvement!
---
Atom cats here with come!!
---
Like how several other people said about aswell, what makes it so different from this? cause I was honest and didn't like the patch notes? aight dude, lmao
---
also 2/10
---
ATOMS FOR THE ATOM GOD
---
Yeah it's stupid. I'm trying to build sensible houses but the game doesn't like it. I do the same as you, breakdown the blueprint but sometimes just can't be bothered. Like last night when this occurred and my house couldn't be placed I just knocked the game off, which rarely happens
---
oh what a shame, i was shooting for a fat zero
---
What’s the ETA on it being live again? How long does maintenance usually take?
---
I know, right! But since I didn't find it I thought perhaps it had been moved as a reward for the Manhunt-event perhaps, since it had to do with escaped prisoners and all that jazz. But I see others here confirm the "usually"-part, so I guess ..sigh, I guess I'll never get that disco-ball then, because no way I'm running all over Appalachia another time just to find Grahm :P I spent almost all yesterday on that!
---
Prize bot I listen to - though the gas certificates are no good to me. The insult bot - pretty much smack him when I see him.
---
I am sure over time that massive amounts of stuff will appear in the Atom Shop.
---
I hear you. 
---
I'm on the opposite side of the spectrum. I made 2 alternate characters just for  Survival and it's been quite profitable.
---
Does the 0 cap player damage debuff exist? I haven't tested it personally.
---
You're way over optimistic. This has nothign to do with the repair kit backlash. They fully intend on doing that. 1. These things are way too soon to have to do with that. 2. They haven't said one word about the backlash. If they were going to backtrack they would have said they were going to.   
---
Instead they just want you to expend enough atoms to feel like you need to pay more. I would have no problem with this if they kept to cosmetic only, but they're not. Expect to see the repair kits get added in at some time (maybe far enough in the future that people will have mostly forgotten).
---
I seem to remember being able to scrap my stored CAMP items.  It's been a while since I did it, but I scrapped a ton of my farm plants without placing them directly from the Stored menu.
---
Look at your key prompts when highlighting a stored item.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Not gonna lie..... you blew my mind, i figured it was a diff look for regular power armor sets, not the hardest set to acquire, do you know how to get that armor other than scorch beast queens, and luck? 😂
---
Thank you 😁
---
**Workbenches:** The Vault-Tec Weapons Workbench no longer changes positions after its owner Fast Travels.
---
Lots of good stuff, but this! I can finally use that paint job I bought a couple months ago!
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Who said i don't have it?
---
Lol yeah i don't. I don't use power armor or use ultracite,so skins are not a priority. The red cooking stove....oh now we talking.
---
I don't believe so but I'm often wrong so don't quote me😂
---
You both kinda sound like assholes IMO
---
Sadly, this has come to be my experience in 4 out of the last 5 times I've fought her.  I have posted numerous replies to just this subject and I usually end up lecturing to inexperienced players on the protocol required to kill the Queen.  So many players are just there to run around and try to get the Legendary drops off the adds, or to just sponge up XP.  They totally ignore the Queen and have no intention of helping the players with the weapons that can get the job done.  My last event was last week. About 12 players showed up ranging from level 30 on up with me being the highest at 198.  The launchers were around 100 and they bullseyed Prime with their launch, which was a bad omen right off the bat.  Long story short, it was exactly as you described in your post.  We failed with the bitch at 1/2 health with 1 minute remaining.  I started picking flowers at that point. I put 4k of 5mm ultrcite into that fight.  I don't know how many cores the guy with the gatling laser used.  We were the only ones doing damage and only 2 melee guys and they were around level 60 or 70 and only one looked to be running bloodied.  I looked up once after she had regenned and there about 7 players across the field chasing around after another scorchbeast.  I know there are successful events everyday out there, and I have fought alot of times where everyone was helping and doing their jobs and we still failed by just that much, but it was still a team effort and still felt worth it, because it was Herculean, but it's been a long time since I've been part of one of those .  I hate to be like this, but from now on when someone launches for that fight and I show up to 8-10 or so level 30's in hazmat suits and only 2-3 over 100,  I'm bugging out.  This fight is too expensive for a certain failure.
---
exactly what I was thinking. What the heck this bucket of bolts does now?
---
Well at each time, you owe over 70k. So wonder how much u r in debt.
---
Haha, you still rocking the Gestapo look now?
---
Huh. It's odd, I've never had anyone PVP me for it. Actually, I mostly see them unclaimed during my play time. But that's been in the last month, where all the PvP folks have scarpered off to survival. Might be worth a go.
---
I never worked out a build before hand. Just played and got to where I am now. Was very lucky with my .50cal
---
If you get a gang of people together with the same mindset, anything is possible.
---
Also, the group in your example most certainly shared the same definition of griefing, (ie. clearly defined rules and expectations), otherwise there would have been more conflict.
---
That’s the issue with many players in FO76 - they think being killed by another player is being griefed.  They think having someone attack your camp or workshop is being griefed.  They define being griefed as any unwanted experience, which is not true.
---
A common example is two players setting up a trade when a third comes along and starts shooting one or both of them.  The first and second player had their trade interrupted, and are upset.  The third player may not have known they were trading.
---
How is nerfing melee damage going to change anything in regards to melee viability in pvp? They still can 1 shot people without these mutations. The problem is the fact that engagement distances favor rifles due to Survival mode being a compass war.  
---
Melee still has stealth boys to assist them closing the gap but at the same time you gotta pick your fights and play smart. You don't fight with melee in a field for example.  You gotta pull your opponents into some close quarters.
---
Hooooly crap.
---
What a datamine. This stuff is just AMAZING. Like the only thing I'm disappoitned about is that the Tactical Ops outfit looks like underarmor. (I'm still sad the Marine Wetsuit is underarmor. LET ME WEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OVER MY ARMOR. My desire for a Catwoman character is strong.)
---
But seriously!
---
* THE PLUSHIES.
---
* That Retrowave floor.
---
* Freaking DEATHCLAW SKIN RUG.
---
* NEW LETTERS.
---
* Those epic warning signs. I need more signs. Can we have more friendly signs too?
---
* I don't even wear PA, but that Raider Excavator skin is AMAZING.
---
* After we've all pieced together makeshift bars, of course we now get an awesome bar-set!
---
Honestly, I just need a second camp at this point. (And a whoooole lot more ATOMS.)
---
Perfection
---
Excavator power armor piece breaking thus losing the bonus carry weight. Losing your food buffs such as radstag steaks, etc. That also effect carry weight. 
---
As for one weapon, yeah most of my characters don't carry multiple guns, they carry their main weapon and then a melee weapon for up close so they don't accidently blow themselves up with their explosive rounds.
---
Seems pretty pointless to carry extra guns that you aren't specced for? 
---
Keep in mind even if the repair kit is only a minor p2w item, it still goes against what Pete Hines said about the atom shop being only cosmetics and have no bearing on gameplay. If i would have known they plan on adding p2w instead of keeping it purely cosmetic in the real world money shop I never would have purchased the game.
---
They straight up lied to their customers which is beyond screwed up.
---
As someone who has keep playing at least a little most days since before launch, some of these changes are very welcome and sound like they will be things that I very much appreciate.  Almost all of them in fact, and so far, I haven't thought of any downside to what I read in these notes - other than thinking that I'd slightly prefer that they left the "preview window" when you look at your stash box, but, I believe that may simply be the feeling that most people have about preferring things to stay how they are used to, and the idea of change being discomforting, unless there is a strong clear upside that they can see for themselves.
---
In the arena at the ski lodge up near top of the world has  raider power armor
---
That assaultron gun skin.... hooooboy!
---
Lots of goodies

Yes... yesyes
---
Robotics perk would make him friendly ?
---
Hol. Cheers for telling me that I did not see that, might have been avoiding them for a another month. Again Cheers for pointing that out to me!
---
Faction wars is coming, so... I hope so? 
---
I think when you look at all those "minutement improved" style mods for all the other games, it’d be a real shame if in faction wars we all war the same basic team colours. I’d like all factions to get some love, including those I have no intention of playing.
---
I'd imagine that more will try it. 
---
Really tho the game needs at least 3 modes.
---
Adventure, Survival (an actual survival world with reduced in game loot to make living a challenge but still not full on PVP based), and Anarchy where pew-pews play.
---
...wtf. Ok, I'll have to look into that.
---
0/10 response, mentioned other people but didn’t provide link to other people
---
I appreciate your datamining, it doesn't go unnoticed!  I look forward to seeing your posts every patch.  Thanks again for all the hard work you do for the community!
---
Do you play solo or alone?  The best way to “farm” Grahm is to have someone sit on him, then quit the game and rejoin to reroll him.  It may take a few times, but eventually you’ll find that mirror ball.  That’s how I had to find the Powered Door Plan back in the day.
---
I suppose, seems like a weird flex, so many awesome variants of limited power armour paints out there but blackbird gets all the attention lol.
---
The War Rider and Raider Excavator Power Armor skins are EXACTLY what I like to see!
---
I just wish there would be Raider variants for the T-series.  The T-45 would probably look like TribalPower Armor.
---
Yup. I view "holding companies to their word" as important to not getting screwed over, you're eager to hand over more money for less product.
---
Still no fix for the Overseer's mission not being able to be completed.
---
So was it the actual content you didn't like or the style? Pray do tell. The devs await with baited breath

---
Lol worth a try
---
Regarding point 2 energy weapons were never intended to be explosive, hence their being removed from the loot pool, so it's reasonable to assume they were also disconnected from any such perks.
---
Four Loko
---
Man he's talking about how people always think they are banned every update when it's just the servers are down lol
---
I've tried every few levels since level 20.  Never got close enough to actually 'learn' any of the locations.  Your fear is reasonable.  Wish I had known more and saved the supplies.
---
What is your time worth?
---
2 handed or 1 handed?
---
Mines so close, I'm a little bit north of the clubhouse and it's maybe 1 cap? I never fast travel to the resort lol, just walk
---
Yes I’ve seen this bullshit argument before. They think “the patriarchy” prevents women from being true equals and are therefore always acting from an oppressed position. It’s a strangely regressive perspective if you think about it.
---
I mean I had a slight theory the other day. This may have been added for their dungeon to allow players to build it for the need to go through that dungeon. In every description for the dungeon it says check your armor. Left to be seen though. And I do also understand a pay to win item when it was previously Bethesda wasnt doing so.
---
I was hoping they’d finally fix the pc versions constant stutter n lag.
---
Yes, zero are no good, but 1% becomes 100% in conversion. I would like to imagine that they would explode like a grenade. You can eject them in FO4 as weapons. It would be nice to do in F76.
---
Honestly depends how much attention the thread gets. I've had many of my issues acknowledged by the community dev's already. Some of which got fixed in the most recent patch a couple hours ago. 
---
I had time so why not make a thread about balance.
---
Blue berry coca cola
---
Ayyyy. I too am a man of culture.
---
How was he broken? Anyways encounter him a few times always insulting so idk
---
Pretty fuckin close, keep trying though. Even shitbirds can achieve with the proper motivation.
---
I agree, the raider set is especially annoying. I can walk over to the toxic valley and pick up an alien blaster, but I can’t make one of the worst armor sets in the game. I don’t fully understand that rationale. 
---
(I’m aware the alien blaster sucks right now btw, it was just an example.)
---
And the many QoL updates too. Renaming things, and the Whitesprings vendors are awesome.
---
It was delayed till next month. They told us a few weeks ago.
---
dont die, git gud
---
Or unarmed?
---
Huh fair enough, apologies if this is a massive oversight on my behalf
---
&gt;I am calling them out SPECIFICALLY because they’re the ones that bear the responsibility for what you’re about to show them.  
---
&gt;I want you to show them the sum of an equation. This equation measures the profit lost by one person’s word of mouth killing the interest for six other potential customers. Point out to them that if losing just one previously-loyal customer loses you six others, the word of mouth around your product is fatal. Those six people all know other people, who know other people, who know other people. This bad decision is akin to spiking your public water supply with cyanide instead of fluoride. Measure the profit-shredding effect of our displeasure. Show them, in hard, cold, unfeeling numbers, what the consequences are to their bottom line. Show them what it does to merchandising. Give them nightmares
---
Please represent me in my inevitable life-time divorce one day.
---
So don't kill them constantly.
---
Many people including myself were never blessed to be insulted by him, that's why he was so broken😞
---
I have been waiting for renaming and the vendors to be connected since the beta it is so nice to finally have it
---
How dare someone kill an enemy before you!

What do you mean??
---
Oh man I NEED that Nukashine Distillery in my life

Yup! Will be buying! Hot damn

You think that's bad? I got like a couple dozen Hornwright access codes from that stupid Battle Bot event that I can't seem to get rid off. HELP!

Recently He chased me down so I brought him to an SB, and as hard as I tried she would not fight him!

Ended up killing him for being so annoying

Weapon Class/Type: If it says Rifle in the Weapon/Perk name, it's a Rifle/Effect, same applies to pistols, Shotguns, etc.
---
Weapon Subtype: Rifleman/Expert/Master are for semi-auto,
---
Commando/Expert/Master are for Auto.
---
Things like the Gauss Rifle mess with this (Rifle Class, Energy Gun Subtype, Ballistic Damage), but in general, the above rules apply.

Any news on suspended players anyone ?
---
Where from Grafton? I heard since patch 5 they stopped showing up. I’ve tried server hopping like mad
---
This is an awesome patch, thank you!
---
I’m right there with you.  Back in the day I recall telling myself, “Don’t worry about buying plans, you’ll find them naturally as you progress in the game.”  Regretting that mindset now...
---
Until they're done, this was scheduled mind you not like it was random haha
---
Changed today to number of player kills.
---
There is already enough incentive in junk and aid items to pvp, the extra caps gives you way too much of are reason to pull the trigger instead of choosing to interact.
---
This is almost all good stuff, some of it strikes me as really good news, and I think most of these changes will be highly appreciated.
---
I suppose I'm slightly disappointed that the motivation for my daily visiting of each shop will no longer push me to follow that routine.  Of course, I'm glad that I'll be able to just pop over to the shop next to my camp and get all 1400 caps even if I didn't have much time.  Sometimes during a day when I'm busy, I might only have time to eat a quick lunch then need to go do things away from my desk/PC, and, it's better if I don't stay up late at night to try to catch up on the "shop run" because I don't want to miss the daily cap transaction limit.
---
I've been playing since beta and have never come close to reaching the cap limit of 25,000 until recently - now I'm at about 22,000 caps I think.  It's actually upsetting that the limit is so low because some of the plans cost thousands of caps!!!    
---
I anticipate that someday I will be in a situation where there is some good item that I wan to buy, but won't be sure whether or not to buy it, because it will mean I don't have many caps left...  
---
I'd like to buy some armor that would make it so I can't be "1-hit" killed in PVP, as I find that to be extremely obnoxious and upsetting when it happens...  I'd also like to acquire some type of ballistic weapon that feels like it's powerful enough to actually do significant damage to enemies like the Scorch Beast Queen, etc., rather than feeling like I have to sit there all day until the gun breaks, my ammo is gone, and pieces of my armor break, just for one fight.

According to Fallout lore, the Quantum variety comes with “..twice the calories, twice the carbohydrates, twice the caffeine, and twice the taste as a normal Nuka Cola. Nuka Cola is a Berry Lemonade Soda. Like Coca Cola just with Berry Taste. There was a bunch of sales that actually sold REAL Nuka Cola Quantum you can google that yourself.
---
I got mine before that patch but have heard of friends since the patch finding it, but as I said it's spawn is much rarer now!
---
I'd give 5k for the 3* marine chest, I'm a little low on caps but I'd love an unyielding marine set and want to get it going lol
---
Seriously i don’t even want to waste time and ammo on level 30 ants and 21 rats. What’s the point. Many event bosses are forever low level which really defeats the purpose. They SHOULD scale properly and not stay low level. It’s probably a glitch.
---
How much longer will they ignore this scathing review of their actions? It's been 30min.
---
Yeah, nothing on two walls in this. I've only got one sign.

Could it be the power connectors? Generator on one floor, sign on another?

Damn there's finally some stuff in the atom shop that I want.
---
It will fit nicely with my game tag.
---
It's definitely a berry flavor, at least based on the "Nuka Cola Quantum" that Jones Soda released a few years ago. If it was \*really\* a thing, it would probably have a slight metallic taste to it given the radioactive isotopes added to the mix.
---
Each of them adds up to 15% damage per card. 
---
You can have Rifleman+Expert Rifleman+Master Rifleman equipped for a 45% damage increase to Semi-Auto Rifles, or the Commando variants for Full-Auto.
---
personally, i think it would take like burning. since it is made with a radioactive isotope in order to maintain that alluring blue glow
---
Server techs seems more likely.

I am really curious what turrets got the 100% buff and which got a 15% buff
---
There is a massive patch currently being implemented, with new quests, items, events and more. Server will probably be down for another hour or so. If my memory is accurate updates usually take 1-3 hours. Welcome back!
---
It would taste like blue
---
Agreed. Id like to be able to craft and learn the mods for the armor as well as make a raider themed build while leveling up a new character.
---
Cool that it was scheduled, still they should have an ETA like any other normal company would. Looks like this game is still a joke.
---
Makes it harder to find Grahm though
---
That's what i'm talking about. I really like the old school text based games, but i'd like ti see something like Battle Chess too. I'd definitely open an arcade with disco balls and cool posters.
---
Is Technical still misspelled in “Forbidden Knowledge” tho
---
Nope, I read it too.
---
Yes plz
---
Oh heck no!  I'm so glad Survival came out and all the PVP players left.  Now we can enjoy PVE.
---
I've run into him at the sign for Sutton at the base of the hill, as well as flatwoods (three times) and under the red trestle in Charleston. You'll find him eventually, but I wouldn't try to "chase" him down. The electric chair, you might have to server hop for it, but it's been in Sutton regularly for me (my Camp isn't far away, so it's a cheap fast travel vendor for me).
---
What's the caps range you would acquire doing said run?
---
Gave a low lvl a lvl 40 3 *** aa Gatling gun last night .Totally worth it to see him run around in circles and give the heart emote mad my day.
---
The best patch yet. Only thing I’m not seeing is a fix for heavy guns accuracy when shooting through chain link fences and certain other objects. You can be aiming dead on target and your bullets will go toward the top left of the screen instead. This doesn’t happen with any other weapon type.
---
https://imgur.com/Kd1X6I9.jpg

Hopefully it's just a skin that you can apply to an under armor of your choosing.
---
I’m stuck inside of an irl DMV right now so definitely free states 😅
---
So the guy linking the sever status a few comments below is a server tech? Or a dedicated fan?
---
Dude just fuck this mentality. I can't believe these people exist? Women want dick and they can't even be honest about it.
---
I feel like nuke cola was less viable when 1 shots were more viable. Adding one shot protection really made so many more build types less viable and opened the door to cheesy mechanics. I never see melee builds that do well in survival like you did before PvP servers dropped. I understand the sentiment, but now there’s clearly only a few viable builds in PvP and it’s all kind of boring
---
If they can keep coming up with things like this (not just the PA skins, but all of the stuff found here), they'll have no reason to put things like the repair kits for sale.  THIS is the kind of stuff that will get me (and lots of other people) to shell out cash for atoms.
---
The stuff here looks great, kudos to the designers.
---
Let's just hope none of this will be lock behind 'rare' even awards ;-)
---
Vaults have plans and stuff outside of them?  I might start stopping by them now.
---
You're right, how dare they not tell the guy that seems to hate the game when he can play. Grow up and wait like everyone else, it's a bit update
---
The effects.  Do they stack? As in, is it beneficial to have  two kinetic servos on?
---
Both were mid 90s
---
Still no fix for the wonky daily quest appearances it seems. For the various More dailies, the trigger location is all wrong and outside of Queen of the Hunt (which now triggers as I approach Berkeley Springs from the south) I haven't figured out how to access the others like Play Time or Idle Explosives.
---
I want my Travelling Leather Coat!... eventually
---
I am not a PVP player. I am happily sticking to adventure mode.
---
I mean you are saying for the future, levels are getting slower and slower. Like unless you dedicate time to farming you barely can get a level per day if you spend 3-4 hours playing at level 200.

I'll keep you posted

Very informative. I will try this when I get out of work. Thank you and everybody else for your information. I really appreciate it.

Thanks for the input but it's not a solution. I've built a LOT in this game, used brick both ways, reverse can be problematic as it is, and if you want anything more than a one story box, it looks like shit.

I should have break more combat armors back in the day. Only one BoS mod plan.

Game wasn't good on launch so you come back and you are mad they are updating it to make it better. Are you alright pal?

AAE + Tank Killer gives me 85% atm, no perforating mag attached. (Which would give me even more) But you’re right about shotguns.
---
Yeah pvp is whack and boring. You cant kill a min/max'd sent/assass player with a pistol, explosive weapon (rpg/grenade launcher/fatman) or melee weapon. Only explosive auto rifles, shotguns and heavys are putting in work atm.
---
By that comment, we don't want you back
---
Because if they guessed and posted an eta people like you would be on here screaming “it’s past 12 servers aren’t up yet WTF Bethesda!”
---
maybe they should already have implemented npcs, to make sense of faction wars
---
Okay, it was late and I misunderstood your problem lol apologies &lt;3
---
Azul Calcinado
---
It does, you're not trying hard enough
---
Linking a server status and knowing how long the job will take are two entirely different things.
---
Create a new account with Bethesda and do not do things that look like you are trying to dupe items ie drop and disconnect. 
---
 Unless you are a repeat offender and have had you xbox account flagged.
---
I'm pretty sure you're wrong mate
---
A 1/8 decrease in caps yield is just stupid.
---
I agree with you, but someone else on this thread did make the point that if you did that you’d have ppl camping afk. But we had that during Fasnacht! It’s going to happen regardless
---
Daaaaaaamm man. Thats sweet. Gonna do that. Even better lol
---
I am trying to find and take screenshots of any in-game lore photos so I can have them as loading screens, but I wasn't aware of this one.  Where is it?
---
But the answer to the question is with the server status, proved by said link my guy
---
I see, makes sense from a collectors perspective. 
---
Im hyped for the bunny plushie, everything else is irrelevant to me. Must collect all cute items and fill my camp with a horde of cuteness.
---
How long will server maintenance last? That question? The one in the title? No?
---
PRAISE TODD
---
I don't see them backing down from that just yet... sure skins make some money, but forcing people to buy if they want a chance is even more effective
---
You were the level 20 fighting, and losing, against a much higher level?
---
How is that broken?  The time invested into a high level character almost always means they’ve been through the grind for better gear;  they typically have more experience; and they have more perks, usually built for a purpose.
---
If you were the level 200-something repeatedly killed by a level 20...it’s not the game, it’s you.
---
I’ve often thought a level range is needed for this game, except level 50+ varies so widely on the player.
---
Just read this online.  All looks really good.   Glad to see issues fixed that I actually wrote tickets and submitted data for.
---
Ah fuck, the shop is starting to get pretty good
---
I am, servers are still down though :/
---
95*
---
I also agree that they should have left the penalty/reward system alone. I thought the whole appeal of survival was that I could potentially rack up a ton of caps, but could also lose all of them, too. It added a unique way of earning caps rather than grinding. If losing supplies and caps was an issue for the player, then they just didn't play survival.
---
They average between 2-4 hours for a big patch like this. They also have to update ALL their servers, which I don't think you realize is a MASSIVE undertaking. The fact that they can do it in just a few hours is really pretty efficient. And we are getting all this new content completely for free! I don't think you get it...
---
Honestly! It’s not like they’re gonna make much money from this thing, they’d make much more with some handmade skins! It’s not worth the backlash, who at Beth thought this was a good idea??
---
Im assuming the nuclear winter mode dropping in the summer is gonna be faction based pvp. Ive heard others say it may be battle royale though.
---
They literally say 2-3 hours haha
---
Are you on PC? I'm a level 340 power gamer that just crafted 100K ultracite ammo and am quite bored. Would love more people to play with.
---
Yeah I also loved it (level 110+) it was the first time that I consistently saw half the server or a good amount of people all participating in something aside from the queen. 
---
It was a fantastic social gathering.
---
I’ve noticed they changed the main menu notice in the corner from the “servers are down” message to the new “shear terror is here” one, so it could likely be up in the next 40 minutes. Fingers crossed.
---
I suggest using talons and twisted muscles.
---
My character's strength is only at 3, but he's insanely painful at power fisting. He has all mutations and some lower strength as well as increase it in certain situations.

Those 2 mutations would definitely help.

exactly. I just thought it was funny this is the first patch or downtime without a deluge of those posts.

Same. Some tracks from the previous Fallouts would be the honey beast’s knees!

Thing is even though you match melee with a rifle, your expending 1000x more resources to kill the SBQ in comparison. I don't even break 1 bloodied deathclaw/power fist while i solo her. While with a rifle your going through a TON of rounds to do the same. 
---
That's why melee needs a nerf in some way and mutations in my opinion are the best solution since its the easiest free source of damage.
---
Absolutely loving all of this. Each wave of stuff is just progressively getting better and better.
---
Either I’m gonna have to start buying atoms or I’ll have to be banging out a ton of challenges soon.
---
Why use many words when few do same?
---
Looks like 16, based on my ability to count.
---
Pardon me for #playing the game my lord
---
You fools. You will never beat me on my fax machine.
---
Yea those wall/ceiling mounted ones would be really nice to have
---
No longer will I accidentally shoot the Whitespring robots and then have to fun for my damn life.
---
It is still the beta. And providing an incentive to murder everyone you meet is stupid
---
hmm, they said they fixed that in the patch notes... ugh... well, maybe next time!
---
That's a separate bug that will need to be addressed I presume
---
Ikr worst possible time I bought the game. First I couldn't even play at all and then this fuck up...
---
Is there anyway to add notes on our maps?  Or did I miss this anywhere?  We all have a map and its functional, but i'd love to mark locations of where I found resources, interesting sights, CAMP areas, and staging areas and keep them saved.
---
More like Pepsi blue
---
All I need is for them to release the already previously added black Excavator and add an Ultracite black skin, then my PA set is complete!  I have other paints but Blackbird gets all the attention so I'd like my Excavator and Ultracite to match the rest.
---
Pretty rad.
---
That means my BE reduced weight 50 cal would go for like 300 when it's worth 10k to a player easily
---
OK thx
---
Whatever the fuck is that blue soda from Jones, with a ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE dose of CBD, a little B-complex, 50% coconut water( because it does actually heal a little), some weird vaccine that gives humans the glowing gene from fish and like a pound of sugar per bottle because its a 'F you" to any other soda.
---
EA DICE introduces massive patches with almost no downtime at all. Activision introduces patches with no downtime at all. Ubisoft does scheduled maintenances, gives their playerbase an ETA, they extend it if they have to and communicate this to their playerbase. Meanwhile at Bethesda: Oh well we dont to servers so we dont know.
---
If they gave us everything on day one, that's have nothing left to give us 6 months later. I'd imagine most if not all will be available eventually.
---
For anyone wondering how looks the greedy Bethesda.
---
What stash box skin is that white with black inlay? I wants it, but have no memory of seeing it before. Was it a 1 day exclusive? Or not yet released?
---
Well, I mean... They do have to go in and update an entire database of players, items, etc. with a new classification category.
---
In the end is it "hard"?  Likely no.  But it does take more effort than a simple "if then".  And has to be done carefully as to not corrupt or hopefully not cause any other problems in the existing database.
---
Two months ago I added an entry to a database where I work that stored a mere 500 recipes.  Turns out the system created null entries for the recipes that existed prior to the change, instead of zeros.  Upon them finally loading an entry, it sent null data instead of zero and corrupted the process.  And it wasn't found until the production team finally loaded an old recipe weeks after the change.  Oversight on my part, yet my database was only 500 recipes with about 100 entries per, with a single person involved in the system.  Imagine multiplying that database out by thousands, then putting dozens of people's hands into the mix.
---
Yeah, most players don't realize that some of us were actually trained as children to survive a nuclear blast by getting under 30 lbs. of desk and putting our arms over our heads.  
---
I love to read the stories where a lower level was helped by the higher level and learned there is actually an unspoken etiquette for those public events.  Especially like to hear those who pay it forward.
---
Create a new user on tour ps4 and you should be good. It should auto make a quick Bethesda account
---
I've never seen him either.  "Only" 200 hours in or so (started a little late), but he's never shown up for me.
---
Vats builds are about to be op!
---
I just jumped away for a while it was cool when i got back, though any sentry bot i go past i sheath my weapon just in case
---
Still waiting on Ornate Stash box to be purchasable.   T-T
---
Its better to install the 4gb
---
Yeah that's the problem not everyone should be hostile just because we can be. It cheapens the mode
---
I picked up a few .50cal but I'm holding out for a legendary
---
Any digital titles you own on your Xbox can be shared with other accounts on your Xbox. As long as you have your Xbox set to Primary for that account.
---
You would need to make a new Xbox Live account, and you will have access to Fallout. Once you hit the main menu, you will be prompted to making a Bethesda account.
---
You should be good from there!
---
\#Notevensorry
---
haha yeah not sure why they are called weapon skins but that's how they are named in the files, so i just followed that ;-)
---
That’s the point. Go back to adventure mode
---
Not to sound dumb, but do mods affect the class? For example I think the handmade has a mod that will make it full auto...if I equip this mod will be affectted by "auto" perk cards, or will handmade always be considered "semi-auti?"
---
I'm assuming handmade isn't considered auto by default. If it is, I chose a poor example
---
Agreed. My concern moving forward is if Bethesda move with a pay to win attitude then concerns that are non profit related will get relegated. I worry for the future of adventure mode, I'm hoping that greed does not replace the hundreds of thousands of f76 gamers who paid for a game, subscribed to psn and then enjoy the patch updates..I want reassurance that we are not going to feel forced to pay to improve our game...
---
You basically just described adventure mode. Tf?
---
Melee is all about strength. High strength will give you high damage so max it out. The best strength perks are incisor and martial Artist. I also use blocker and Barbarian, but that's because I don't use power armor. You'll find Radicool in Endurance, and makeshift warrior in intelligence are also relevant perks.
---
Lol yep! There was even a guy who raised his hand with the photo mode pose :D
---
Tons of bug fixes and things players asked for getting implemented, and new DLC completely free? And you give it a 2 out of 10? Lol. Go take a long walk off a short pier. Maybe a good cold dunk in some water will clear your head.
---
I'm definitely playing Survival more regularly now. 
---
I played during the double XP weekend and found myself going back to CAMP and killing myself every 40-80 minutes as I crept back up the survival board.   Now I can play on fair ground where I can get one-shot because of my obliviousness to someone happening to find me, rather than my obliviousness to me being at #2 on the board and broadcast to the world. 
---
That and being able to keep *some* of the caps I make.
---
well, I've seen a bloodied, and I've seen an explosive, so most likely, yes. There's a chance that they are a small percentage drop, or the people that have them, don;t want to trade
---
It’s okay. I have fun with it, but I’m also the type that would never want to play without being a mutant.
---
Today (Patch day) seemed like a good day to return to your note.
---
Thanks again!
---
Hi there! If you check my post History you may Add what I have found to your list.
---
I do a Run that starts at Middle Cabins and goes around the Western part of the Map for 65 Stashes in the run. Morgantown has a few more Caps hiding in it :)
---
Space Suit Clean
---
Ranger Hat Clean
---
Ranger Outfit Clean
---
LOL first thing I am doing is renaming the 6 or 7 PA frames in my stash.
---
Yeah end-game my ass when you can server hop for mutations or buy from other players for like 250 caps.  Doesn't change the fact its free damage that blatantly turns everything in the game to one-shot fodder. 
---
People don't debate if they should or should not have it. Like you said when i suggested the nerfs, you said it wouldn't be worth it. That's the debate. Some people would still consider it worth but as it stands right now you use no matter what because its so overpowered.
---
Liquid meth
---
you dont have to be a fucking asshole about it, but i guess that is just who you are  "based on my abilty to count" FU
---
i didnt see int he text on this post where it shows that
---
Thanks for this list!
---
&gt; Aluminum Oil Can incorrectly scraps into Oil and Steel, instead of Oil and Aluminum as the name suggests, Aluminum Tray incorrectly scraps into Steel, instead of Aluminum as the name suggests
---
This is a bit unfortunate, though. Aluminum is already hard enough to come by, now two of the easiest and best sources are bugged to make steel. :/
---
So still unable to inspect the vendors items before buying. \*super sad face\*
---
That was all we had time for testing at that time
---
There are clean hats to go with the miner and steelworker outfits and a clean skiing hat, I’m sure there are more but I don’t really take much notice.
---
I have a .308 bolt action quad pipe rifle but revolver and the other.44 pipefle dont spawn i believe. I know pipe revovler dont for sure.
---
Then how to explain how sometimes after just logging in for the first time in a week, a vendor has 2 caps left but a different one 200?
---
I went in the Nyla Cola factory and poked around and there was a place with a bunch of consumer tests and feedback and I believe there was something about the ingredients and there was definitely some kind of amphetamine in there as I remember lmao! 
---
I liked someone’s above idea of red bull and cocaine lol! Or it could taste like carbonated light blue Gatorade but flavored stronger yummmmm
---
But if it tasted like berry Coca Cola, ewwww! Coke is the nectar of the Gods and they should never try to add flavors to it omg that new orange vanilla bullshit they just came out with? Major ew!!!! If it ain’t broke then don’t fix it!
---
I love the gun and can craft every sight and scope and nothing else
---
FISTO
---
If it's a stored blueprint you should be able to break it down into its constituent parts.
---
Other items *should* be able to be scrapped but I've noticed my stored corn and razorgrain make me place them.
---
Is there a definitive list of tamable animals? Every place I look has different info.
---
Most of these can be purchased from the traveling responder bot who frequently appears outside the Charleston train station.  He will typically have two rare outfits (like the Hunter's Long Coat) and he carries the plans for the Cuckoo clock and the Nuka-Cola clock.
---
Sooner or later we’ll see them !
---
Most of the camp stuff bethesda added has been added to the atom shop. I doubt that we will see a significant amount of new camp items added for free or achievable through gameplay.
---
On pc, still got the servers down message on the pc. In uk though so maybe it’s different by region.
---
I know that instancing servers can be a bit of a pain (most games have instances on a totally separate set of servers), so I'm not terribly surprised that it's not a common thing here.  I don't know if there are just NO instances, or if some of the building/etc. are instanced in some way.
---
That being said, I don't know how they're going to implement 'raids' if there isn't some kind of instanced area.  I can't imagine getting 4 people together and zoning into a cleared area.
---
If they have it, or are just getting it started with these raids, it's conceivable that they could somehow set up instancing for areas...certainly for inside buildings or other areas that you have to zone into.  But that does bring challenges, as anyone who lived through WoW's area instances have seen.
---
Now imagine a raider armor skin skin rug
---
Damn you broke out a 90's diss!  Would also have accepted "Talk to the hand"!
---
It's out next week, honestly I wouldnt be surprised if it is, could always be switched out for performance stability, but being as it'll be the only raid for a while, it's most likely going to stay for a while
---
I was insulted by its unwillingness to insult me.
---
15 seconds of waiting for some dialogue felt cruel and mean.
---
Yes, it got better...
---
You get the entire set given to you for completing the Brotherhood quest "Belly Of The Beast".
---
All I want is trading like Fallout 3,NV, and 4.
---
Let me select what I want to sell and what I want to buy then be able to confirm that purchase. That way we don't eat into the cap pool and can just get the items we want.
---
Best one imo
---
* **Insult Bot:** The Insult Bot will now insult you.
---
IIRC there was a level 1 bloodied explosvie pipe rifle up on market 76 a few day back. It sold for 15k. Let me see if I can find it again.
---
Hi ! Unfortunately my Discord is italian, as i am too and my clan mates are too. But the Fallout 76 Facebook page has worldwide members always searching for a clan or even had clans recruiting !
---
They know, they will fix someday.
---
I'm gonna drop a good 50 bucks on atom shop
---
Imagine if they could actaully be placed down in some sort of display case, would be awesome
---
Don't forget incisor that's a great perk for melee.
---
I believe the Queen of the Hunt event is also bugged for many people, never triggering anymore.
---
Mostly come from the wandering responders vendor. I've found a clean spacesuit, straightjacket and ranger uniform on them so far. There's a clean white asylum uniform that occasionally spawns at Fort Defiance. The rest, as far as I know, are from the Atomic Shop.
---
My PS is set to auto-download updates.
---
From what I have seen over the last severalpatches....the download is about 1/2 done at 5p (EST), plus install time.... I'm normally playing by about 6.30p.
---
&gt;they had a high chance of killing you as well.
---
Only if you didn't count to 3.
---
"Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out."
---
There is another cap stash at The General's Steakhouse

Still can't get in here. A time-frame on their [status page](https://bethesda.net/en/status) would be nice.
---
It's now been 3 hours. Now back up. How strange.
---
I’m so excited to finally be able to rename my Power Armour Chasis! Thank you Bethesda ❤️ but damn let me play already!
---
remember the blue pepsi? just like that
---
I didn’t realize that perk was that useful. Thanks!
---
I really want a gulper, I think they're cute as hell.
---
Yeah factions do need quests.  It would be a fun way to earn cosmetics or even add in a temporary end game.
---
it is 60 still... [https://ibb.co/mJG7TMW](https://ibb.co/mJG7TMW)
---
I take under 5% damage when she melees me. Full sentinel, 300 DR, blocker, phycos makes it easy. Also blocking prevents stagger. You don't even need to be under 20% hp to solo her. Just staying within 20-50% hp i still can tooltip 1k+ and easily kill her. Just takes a little bit more time. Sounds like you dont kill the queen as much as i do.
---
Oh god, I didn't know it actually played sounds.
---
If you like it, fine. But it’s a joke if you think you’re actually flexing on someone. Most MTX sales come from a small group of whales, not the average player. To the average player you’re just some guy who wasted 18 dollars on a skin that doesn’t do anything.
---
Bring a gun with it specifically for killing scorchbeasts and Queen fights. Other than that, no. The flux cost is too high to maintain ammo for normal gameplay. But I will say, when I pop a Small Guns bobble, a magazine, Overdrive (I think that's the chem for gun damage boost), and some Ballistic Bock along with a dedicated Bloodied rifle build using my lever action, when I hit the queen she melts like icecream in an oven. Every shot knocks a good chunk off of her health. And if it ALSO happens to be night and I can use Mr. Sandman...dead, dead bat.
---
Still waiting on a proper mohawk
---
I think that was about the Favorites?
---
Back when they tried to add this "auto swap out broken weapons" they seem to have introduced a "forgot which weapon was previously equipped".  When you step into or out of a Power Armor, it seems that your "previous weapon" is wiped, so the quick change just swaps to fists.
---
I know it happens upon Power Armor, but it may happen at other times occasionally.  I have not been able to repeat it the other ways, but every time it does happen with Power Armor.
---
lol.  all good.
---
Hopefully a hub and not a place of hostility
---
I foresee a lot of dead workshop owners in whitesprings. Probably a good way to get bulked items as people are selling them.
---
How long to what
---
I want to see if this change works for pets as they are treated as turrets.
---
ur asking this question to ppl who play this all the time everyday..we dont know you play style or anything..i dont get these questions at all
---
Nope, didn't hear anything from PAX east about it either.
---
Oooh boy have I been waiting for this post
---
OMG YAY THIS IS THE BEST NEWS EVER HE WOULDNT EVER INSULT ME AND I GOT SO SAD I CANT WAIT TO HEAR “HALT” NOW AHHHHH YAYYYYY
---
Servers still down, shouldn’t be long
---
Still offline
---
People can bitch and moan all they want. It’s still our current options until Bethesda give us more to work with.
---
Did we ever want them in the first place? 
---
Did their parents?
---
yep, servers still down.
---
Let's hope they listened to concerns about pay to win models too, eh?
---
Condition is the amount of damage an item already has when picked up for the first time.
---
Durability is how much condition it can hold.
---
Nobody got those mask tbh
---
Yes, they do. I’ve seen exactly one on the trade sub and it sold for something like 12k.
---
 In this day and age with the major AAA gaming companies, all DLCs are  "hey fans, here's the rest of our games content for our unfinished game you paid full price for."
---
Since they are bringing in refrigerators in the near future, I also find this phrasing concerning. I doubt they changed the food spoilage by much honestly, they are going to want us to invest in the fridges when they come out. Generally with the cannibal perk, and prepackaged foods, I rarely carry cooked meats or anything anymore. It spoils so fast that it almost all becomes fertilizer.
---
Same boat, my man :)
---
Same here
---
I also have my camp near TotW and met the bot at least 2-3 times there, and in the eastern part of the map. It never actually insulted me, but I guess it should be fixed with this patch.
---
There is the first one i saw today, still waiting for someone to ask if He got banned. I have my Popcorn ready
---
Yeah, logging in shows "account lacks the required entitlements" now. Which means the servers are up, and They're testing them. Should be open soon.
---
Your sister liked my Unstoppables bed.
---
I couldn’t resist.  It had to be said.
---
To some extent, I disagree that Bethesda needs to discuss development with the players.  Perhaps I’m old-fashioned (and I understand the irony of posting this on a form of social media), but are the players really that entitled to believe they deserve input on every aspect of the game?
---
How far down this road of player-involved development do we go?  Will there be a player referendum on every future development?
---
Agreed.  I don't think the repair kits are pay to win but it absolutely is opening the door to move in that direction.
---
I feel your pain, I just lost my deathclaw and am bummed I have to try and tame again.
---
Nope.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/334297/fallout-76-maintenance-april-9-2019/5

https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1115615650582532096?s=19
---
High strength w/ incisor, martial arts (swing speed and damage increase, I think), bloody mess, gladiator, the charisma perk that "force" enemies to give up 5% damage
---
Adrenal reaction is what give everyone the damage as it is. If you don’t like it don’t use it. I think you’re the only one that would debate on using it if nerfed like that. You don’t use it if you’re not using melee/unarmed. Meaning it’s for a specific build. Are you saying eagle eye and whatever else need to be nerfed too so it’s not a guaranteed pick? Stop trying to mould the game to fit whatever you think it should be. Enough of the game has been fucked up  randoms complaining.
---
with perks.

---
Caps isn't the only reason for survival mode
---
Besides that survival mode is still in beta meaning changes and adjustments can and will be made
---
I'm assuming you're one of the guys just camping out in high traffic areas to spawn kill everyone to make quick caps huh?
---
I want a three star one that I can blow dart and smoke radioactive weed with.
---
It gives an advantage that those who haven't bought it doesn't have, so it is, even if marginally.
---
Nah! Blackbird is superior because it's got the sweet military look, although I'll admit I'm buying the raider armors. nukashine looks alright, but I'm a sucker for the military look. And I'm definitely buying the firebreathers skin for the excavator
---
I dont know whats wrong with your ps4 but i just finished downloading and installing the patch in under a hour. Im sitting here spamming the login waiting. I'd say always go for the patch.
---
That one was bolt action i saw it auction off. I’m looking for standard pipe rifle that shoots .38 I’m pretty sure it doesn’t exist.
---
Thanks
---
Hahah yeah I'm surprised at that XD it's so
---
Normal that people ask this that I expect it every time
---
I personally think it's best to go for a fist weapons build. They get less damage perk cards but the cards are slightly stronger individually. Overall, one handed and two handed weapons can get +60% damage boost from 9 perk cards and fist weapons get +30% damage boost from 3 perks cards. The lack of weapon perk card damage boosts for fist weapons is made up for by the Talons mutation which gives +25% damage boost and bleed damage to fist weapons.
---
Knowing this, Fist weapons can put out the same amount of damage as other melee weapons but you have 6 extra perk card slots to put elsewhere. If you put them into incisor, martial artist and/or bloody mess, fist weapons put out significantly better dps than other melee types.
---
I'm hoping it's a forever thing, we have needed more areas that test our mettle against higher opponents and gain exp other than nuke zones and whitesprings.
---
It'll also give the mire a new lease of life with more players going in and out of the area, I'm hoping there's going to be more dungeons in ash heap and toxic valley
---
Cooking stove looks neat, I'll need it for my camp
---
People act like booting this game back up is like taking back a cheating lover lol.
---
All of those examples you gave all still fall under being over encumbered.
---
For the weapons, I’m a rifle build, I carry a furious lever action with me and a TSE handmade, I don’t see how you can think it is pointless carry a extra weapon that you can be specced for, I also keep excavator PA on my character at all times in case of Nuke zones but normally I don’t run around in PA, it’s very easy to not be over encumbered. 
---
As for them lying, maybe they did I think that is up for interpretation though. A repair kit is in no way P2W, if your primary weapon breaks and you don’t have a secondary that is your own fault for not being prepared.
---
Keep an eye on this Twitter account to find out when servers are back up.
---
I use Cannibal too, if only so I don't have to carry so much food around. I do however cook most that I find, as it helps pad the wallet at the end of the play-session.
---
You need to be on the dev team with this kind of talent
---
I'm pretty sure Nukashine is just Four Loko.
---
Some special mobs seem to have spawn locations, I saw the grafton monster and the mothman outside my camp a few times, mostly during the parade event though.  It's possible you're near one of those locations.
---
Some are also included with the special event locations, I saw the mothman a few times while I was spawning Charleston for the responder vendor.
---
I have linked all of my previous lists (there's 8 of them now) above, pretty likely that I've posted them at some point! Keep in mind, I try to avoid posting things that are discussed/seen very frequently since there's plenty of documentation and discussion on them, or things that Bethesda have slated to be fixed down the line in their Known Issues list.
---
I found the best way to avoid this, is to not get banned.
---
Yes!  With lighting
---
There is no real evidence that it does. [Akarnokd posted a very large test post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b8xxbr/loot_drop_chances_roundup_april_3rd/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app), which is great in theory, but it is riddled with methodology problems that negate any meaningful analysis (for example, keeping event and quest rewards as part of the data, when they might have an entirely different drop system, or not focusing one reliable source, like the Watoga bots, to gather data). Of course, there is just as much evidence that it does not have an effect.
---
I *suspect* it does not, in game design terms if nothing else. Tying loot drops to a Luck stat in a multiplayer game is a design failure that I doubt any real game company will make, because once its found out, everyone takes Luck as high as they can, which negates the point of having it linked in the first place because all drop rates are the same for all players again, only this time requiring a specific build. But that is my opinion, not verified fact.
---
I really love the military black skin, if I could get another military looking one I'd jump on it though, I love but it'd look better in a collection, that said i would be a big fan of stands for my PA to display it, please Bethesda I want to flex my collection
---
Luckily the names will be reset when you sell it. Otherwise we’ll be looking at a list of ‘DO NOT DROP’ at vendor bots.
---
Agreed.  Totally needed to see all the bonuses.  It would be great for trading and also just in your inventory while scanning through loot drops.  Seems like the workbench is the only way to really see everything.
---
The reason I don’t believe this, is because I was 4th and started crouching to avoid being found as I moved up. As soon as I hit 1st, someone soon snuck up behind me crouched on a roof in an area with lots of buildings and just killed me. Crouching doesn’t seem to hide you.
---
My dude my group is literally known as the queen killers. I’ve easily killed hundreds of queens. We’ve only stop as of recently as it’s completely unrewarding compared to other legendary farming methods.
---
You'd still have to download the update...
---
I appreciate your help!
---
pls...
---
Oh look, a duper complaining about not being able to be a "trader" because other "traders" are stepping on their toes...just play the damned game!
---
I can't really find a reliable way to reproduce this one (have seen it myself though, just finding technical data in random places on the ground, usually in CAMP), if you know of one feel free to let me know :)
---
The Google document linked has more details
---
Vendor prices on bulk are pretty obscene.
---
They don't need to be instanced - if Bethesda didn't nerf the respawn rates.  Back when the next guy shows up, places would get fully repopulated, it wasn't a problem at all.
---
Sprinting and jumping takes you out of your crouch that might be it.
---
I'm glad we're finally getting stuff for the Excavator armor. That one alternate paint just wasn't cutting it.
---
I need the football outfit
---
Mutations still that good?
---
Yeah, that's one point of view.  I tend to look at things more in an unbiased way unless there's no other way to look at it.  I see it as while you can spend money for that item, you get atoms free for playing and can purchase it with that.  I buy atoms with money but have friends that have thousands of atoms more than me because they do all the daily and weekly challenges.  They'd be able to get more repair kits then me and they don't spend money.  I also look at it that you can get the basic version in the Atom Shop but you can get the improved one by doing specific events.  That's just my point of view though.  In either case, the fact that you can even buy it is paving the way for a P2W system.
---
I dont mind the cap shared venders, but really dislike putting all the venders into one spot, let alone the spot that is already most popular.
---
I like jumping high, so I’d say so. That’s just my opinion though.
---
That, I believe is the point. 😉
---
Fair enough
---
To a degree. If that is so, then you have to measure them by what they are individually giving you. So far, this one is giving a lot more than most, with a 2 year roadmap of free content supported by cosmetic items. And before you say "repair kits"...let's see how that turns out first.
---
Ugh, for sure...

I reaaaallly slowed down leveling on my main once I hit 150 (kinda just gave up on nuked Whitesprings. I don't consider "tag before its vaporized" a fun activity). Only 169 now. But god damn. Literally anyone who saw me wanted to pick a fight for my caps.
---
My \~50 alt? I've literally never been attacked by anyone. Every single encounter involved both of us with guns drawn just kind of looking at each other, until it's obvious neither are shooting so you throw a wave and all is well. Even creepy moments where you hear footsteps come running so you drop into chameleon stealth and stay quiet as they do the same. Tentative silence, then I throw a wave emote, then see a wave emote from behind the wall, and all is well. 
---
Only combat I've really had are the idiots that think its a good idea to make a CAMP at a train station spawn and try to gank people loading in. Each time their base is totally whack with pretty bad turrets, and they're running around in power armor just waiting to get pummeled. Always fun killing them several times while simultaneously taking stealth pot shots at all of their turrets they keep wasting resources repairing. Each time they end up switching servers because I make it my personal mission to harass the harassers.
---
Super glad survival is changing to be more of a "well you can shoot, but should you and do you really want to?". Yeah I want the threat of a raider player or something. But I also want to have moments where we both decide to be peaceful. Much more meaningful holstering your weapon in survival compared to pacifist but with the added threat of people messing with slap damage mechanics to take you down without any real recourse.
---
Thank you! This is exactly the way I would act. Cause this is just fair. And just standing around and do nothing (except grabbing the loot after) is some kind of behavior I really don't like! So I guess I won't get any bad trouble in my first big event in some weeks... 😉 Thanks for the answer! 👍 😊
---
**Quick Swap:** Unequipping Apparel or Throwing Weapons and  then using the Weapon Quick Swap button no longer causes the player to  switch to their fists.
---
That's the one I saw, and was hoping it was about the quick-swap button (left d-pad on my xbox controller) with the power armor switch. I remember the issue had been there for the longest time, and only seemed to get worse. I was really frustrated when the "patch" to fix the unequipping first came out a couple months ago.
---
Being able to jump off mountains and instantly healing is good too.
---
Here's the build I'm using now(mutations included). I 1-shot pretty much all common enemies with an instigating powerfist.

Hmm, but it would be your own fault, if you go to whitespring just for selling. You have still the option to sell your stuff to any vendor on the map (exclusive enclave) and get in touch with the 1400 vendor caps limit.   
---
But good point... I will look out for those poor souls :P
---
Tysm this version is super clean.

Thanks. Think it might be time for a new hard drive in that case.

I do that of course, but I also use it for the bonus xp. That means losing caps and aid and I’m okay with that for the extra levels. Now when I go 40-0 instead of making 8-10k I make 1k and that won’t even cover my ammo costs for that many kills.
---
FWIW, spotlight turrets also increase range and detection of your normal turrets. The but of them not working is cosmetic, where they don’t light up or move. Their script still works.
---
I do a melee build with **First Aid** x 3 and use diluted Stimpaks.  I have had over 500 for a while. I sell them, and give them away. When I make diluted ones, I have **Chemist** and **Super Duper** so I end up with 4-8 diluted Stimpaks per conversion. So I usually end up with 500+ Stimpaks and 160+ diluted.
---
I sell all my chems (except Radaway and Rad-X which I keep about 100 each) and despite that I am still always around 160 lbs of food/chems.
---
My other character has a less well stocked larder, and stash. She is carrying about 150 Stimpaks with 250 in the stash.
---
I was using Pharma Farma (3x), but was getting WAY too many Stimpaks and chems so I stopped using it. I just feel like a chem whore.
---
I am level 195 and I suck too. I am relegated to Excavator with my chem whore addiction.
---
Ty! I downloaded it as well just in case.
---
Its a typical thing game companys do if they are constantly bitched to. Trying to make people happy, but the only ones they see are the people bitching, so they assume it was the biggest issue
---
https://youtu.be/YE5mlNCRe9A
---
I completely agree on the underarmors, i wish there was different plans for under and over armour versions of those.
---
Burning....
---
Yeah. It also shows us that all the X/Explosive weapons are even rarer. One 3\* and no 2\* and the 3\* is a supressors rather than a Bl / TS / AA
---
I love how they've mentioned 3 of the most hated on companies in the gaming industry.
---
Now imagine a raider with rug skin for skin wearing human armor
---
What is there to talk about? People were literally dropping damn near all of there junk or aid, that had a lot on them. That change was actually needed.
---
Can confirm, I get both of these issues. The first one is near 100% guaranteed, even when I'm in power armor. The second one I haven't had that much.
---
This is longer than usual, but expected.
---
Hell yea. Doin the lord's work.
---
Since when has the level of the nuke launcher effected the queens stats? Never noticed a difference and have launched 100s of nukes
---
pretty much. i imagine they dont want a bazzillion users jumping on at once etc
---
They could be a little shiny 45 records and when you collect it you add the song to your jukebox mix. This would be amazing!
---
Depends on whats in the update i think
---
Aight thanks
---
And I think it’s clear that no one knows. It’s got to be easy to test though. Ill help you test it if you want. I’m on Xbox, we can run next to each other and see whose AP refills faster while moving.
---
If they can get away with repair kits pay to win, next will be aid items, then mods for armors and weapons.
---
Consider yourself lucky.
---
This ain’t my 1st rodeo: i’v Tried different heights, angles, distances, on both sides. It embeds itself so deeply, the only way to pick it back up is to change the wall into a doorway.
---
But, I can take that same mirror, and place it on a steel wall in a different part of the same building, no problem.
---
I’m on Xbox if you’d like a first hand demonstration.
---
Or you could just take Power Plant Workshops to make Cores while you play 🤷
---
On god that bar is just what i needed for my kitchen
---
Now imagine you are standing in front of a crowd of people and then look down to realize that you are naked.
---
For me the biggest concern with this is that they've now made it more lucrative for PvPers to go farm owned workshops in adventure mode rather than survival mode. If you're going to nerf the survival mode caps drop rate, you should nerf adventure as least as much.
---
While I did enjoy the high rewards in survival while it lasted, it was always going to get nerfed since more and more players simply resorted to moving all their caps to a friend or a mule. Nothing worse than no reward for killing a lvl 300 player with a lvl 25 character...
---
A few people did but not many, like literally just a few people. Met one on ps4 and got a pic with him in his mask, was the sun looking one.
---
These are all excellent
---
Upvote for paragon
---
Same my dude!
---
I think more people will be willing to hit survival now with the change.  I'm actively farming caps every day to get all the serum plans, so I have personally avoided survival because of it.   I think id be way more willing to play it now.
---
Same! It's so ugly I love it
---
I have an extra green one. I am looking to trade for a red one, or forrest one. I had the red one and accidentally thought it was a duplicate and sold it. Doh!
---
I am on PC with the same login.
---
Yeah if they removed the name it would be better for gameplay and give a real point to VATS besides being an aimbot
---
Might be more effort on the Xbox and the performance drop is more on the players side than server?
---
It does seem silly. Perhaps Kinect data is fatter and less efficient than a simple mic so the game servers get all tied up processing it, slowing everything down around it.
---
I dunno though.
---
It's just out in one of the corridors rather than a room, on like a pedestal type thing or case iirc.
---
I tend to bump into it most times I run through the place, it's not hidden or anything.
---
They're still patching today... All servers are down.
---
It means the servers are still offline. This is normal.
---
Maintenance
---
Servers down for maintenance still
---
When they patched heavy and energy guns a while back they became **far** more viable. I was already using them and have seen a noticeable uptick in how good they are since 👍 **especially** energy guns, which now don't break in seconds lol
---
Time out, that’s not what my question is about at all.  I never asked you to stay away I am asking about the people who grief or bully.  Remember I play too and am still playing I understand that I will come across these kinds of people I just wonder who they are and their psyche.  I would never tell anyone not to do what they enjoy,  it’s my fault that I can’t figure out how to properly pvp or it may be fun.  If I was good enough to pvp I know I would not kill someone while their back is turned or act as if am defecating on the pvp’er I just beat.  Some who do this are young punks others who I wonder about are frustrated people.  Can those people possibly be dangerous?  Timothy mcveigh was a quiet person who had serious issues.  It has always been the people you never thought ended up being the worse.  ( not saying this is happening because of a video game just that seem like a trend maybe an outlet for those people)
---
servers offline due to maintenance
---
Servers are not live yet, the new poster in the menu is tho
---
Right? If I'm not mistaken, reward in adventure mode is 100% of level? A 67 is worth 67 caps?
---
The squecky wheel gets the grease lol. Noone was praising them for anything and only complaints so that's all they heard
---
Use Google before reddit.
---
Try again when the servers come back
---
I almost asked but I posted a pic on r/Market76 and have had quite a bit of help but a fair bit of downvotes, being you can't post pics on this subreddit lol
---
Several hours. Maybe one or two more.
---
So true lol 😂
---
It didn't though. All someone had to do was camp a fucking railway spawn and boom. You lose everything without being able to fight back
---
I'm getting the fire breathers because of the look, and I prefer the ultracite raider
---
I've been here the whole time.
---
Lol PvP is sketchy unless you got the drop in someone kinda need that vats!
---
Use google
---
I expect them to continue to try to find balance. It is a BETA after all. We all know the really high cap yield caused everyone to turn into shoot on sight psychopaths. I made a lot of caps myself. But I’m sure they want survival to be more than that.
---
My god...
---
That’s too funny!
---
Adventure or survival?
---
No, I'm not.
---
in response to the cap adjustments i'm guessing that most of the players in the server stashed all their caps on an ALT to avoid losing much of any, then those players go into survival to rake in caps from spawn camping those who forgot to do so.. or just did not bother. suck up free caps. and repeat. thus limiting the risk vs reward. 
---
alternatively from what i heard the survival mode is a ghost town, again because most players do not want to risk losing their stuff. 
---
&gt;!most of those who cried for the PVP mode still lurk in Adventure, just griefing camps because they do not like worrying about "fair fights" instead opting for easy kills. like targeting lower level players. or camps in easy to find areas. i hope they add PVP camp protection in adventure mode soon!&lt;
---
If they attack me first, I don't feel bad.
---
I don’t think the servers are backup.  So maybe they are.  Hope it’s true as it has been annoying me the last month or so.
---
The game is not even up yet. You don't know how significant the aid loss is now. 
---
Also, for fucks sake, it's SURVIVAL mode, not PVP or Battle Royale mode. It's in the name of the game mode itself. You play it the same way you would play a survival game such as dayz. The main goal isn't to pvp. It's to survive.
---
I need to seriously start grinding those challenges, there’s so much there I now need lol
---
Are Strange in Number and Class Freak still generally broken? Are we ever expecting these to be addressed directly?
---
Yeah, I am on PC and I will dm you, when I am ready to trade. Also I do not require caps or trade. Just help a newbie sometimes.
---
Notice how anyone can backround check how you talk to people on reddit?
---
People were praising them but got over looked by more bitching. We need to praise them more to be heard
---
The amount varies depending on rng per stash. So 50+ times 16 to 100 would be the possible outcome times 2 if adding the cap collector. For an easier number lets do 45 caps per stash x50 then x2 for a total of 4500 caps. This number can go up and down but that would be a good run.
---
I kill low level players, then put shit in their bags
---
was going to say the same thing.  Civil war top hat is the way to go.  Every Pre-war Dollar i pick up is now worth 38 caps for me = )
---
But it has changed to shear terror instead of the maintenence icon. Awesome, was seriously panicking ha
---
Nah they would have shown other texts than just pickaxe pilsner like they did for the other sets
---
There it is!
---
It's way more stable than it was a few months ago - but honestly some issues still linger for me on PS4. Crashing is rare, but all the Bethesda classics are still there (clipping, stupid enemies that don't attack, enemies way too strong or way too weak, enemies that walk off cliffs or inexplicably just die, bullet sponge monsters, or monsters that disappear on death or drop no loot, etc. ). 
---
I still play almost every day, tho. It's fun as hell.
---
Not part of this patch. It was delayed, as they said several times.
---
Just sell the looted stuff from the mobs you kill. Materials need to be bulked but stuff like screws and asbestos can be sold directly. I dump tons of stuff either in paper bags or suitcases at train stations because of the stupid 1400 caps per day limit.
---
There was another post like this. But they moved Play vending to May they have to fix more of the bugs
---
Got delayed to sometime next month.
---
It depends on the depth of the maintenance I suppose. There may be an ET to completion, but I'm not sure what it is.
---
Sometimes I see a low level wanted player and go to kill them as an angel of mercy type of deal. Cause I assume they didn't mean to get the wanted title. Never touch the stuff though. And if they attack me first well then you are dead.
---
these are *all* ATX items?? fuck i gotta start grinding those challenges!
---
For the love of god can we inspect items in trade menus? Im not going to pay caps for an item in trade if I can't see what all of the legendary effects on an item are.
---
I only paid £16 for FO76 and am nearing 700 hrs, can’t complain 😉
---
The servers are still offline...  
---
Servers are still down for maintenance lol
---
Servers are still down

I thought I got banned lol I guess this is a common occurrence

I want Fire Breathers since that's my jam, but I also really, really want the helmet for the Raider Excavator
---
Abacus or bust.
---
 **maintenance** :)
---
Finally someone's asking the relevant question here! Not that it has been asked for about a gazillion times on e.v.e.r.y. s.i.n.g.l.e .u.p.d.a.t.e since november... &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
---
Let me say it with the words of Gabe Nevell, when asked for a date for Half Life 2: "It's done when it's done!"
---
Oh gotcha, thanks lol
---
A Bounty of 5 Caps usually means, they attacked someone or someones Camp continuously, lockpicked a camp door, or stole from a strangers dropped lootbag. By killing this player you actually just have done exactly that what he did, just with actual success. In the End by killing him you helped a newbie get rid of his Bounty, which he would never lost without you.
---
Is it back online?
---
Yup sorry I miss typed your are correct some people where saying they were happy with the current setup just drowned out by the constant complaining just to complain people. I swear some people get on here and just complain but don't actually know or play the game.
---
Phew, I thought my account got nicked. So it's just servers?
---
You mean will you have access to the full 1400 bank?  I imagine it would be too complicated to restrict the last 200 until you get access to the Enclave vendors, so you should have access to the full amount from the start.
---
Yea the servers are still down. I was hoping I could find the sheepsqauch before work. Lol
---
Am not smart enough to know that I can’t even make a good enough build to to keep up with some.  I have Not even figure out where to buy an explosive weapon and can’t for the life of me understand after 107 levels why I can’t get that drop.  I know I will meet these kinds of people.  If they are punks there nothing anyone can say to them if they are frustrated people am sorry for them.
---
Did you try selling something anyway? I have encountered several times vendors have 0 caps but really my day had reset and they did have caps. I just had to try and sell something and it would sell it, for the correct price and then the vendor would have the caps.
---
Agreed especially when they keep seeking revenge.
---
There are letter plans in the game.
---
Before this update, Survival mode is just cap farming for the people who are already extremely rich. I'd agree with you if PvP wasn't so unbalanced atm. Player's who can afford a full set Sentinel or cav are untouchable to the average person who doesn't even know what Sentinel is.
---
Yall really out here when I've got my rock and two sticks?
---
&gt;Let's not pretend that the previous iteration penalty wasn't a tad over the top.
---
I'm not. That's literally one of the first things I said.
---
Now they just need to fix the mobs that spawn for the botstop event, as they sometimes spawn as friendlies.
---
Although I disagree with you on the markers still I would love an increase to 64 players
---
everybody got banned.
---
Could be that - all these replies have me doubting myself!
---
I hope you are wrong :)
---
Now imagine skin rug made of raider.
---
It didn't what?
---
Well they could be special items.
---
Lol for a second I thought I was banned, too, even though I haven't done anything to warrant a ban. Relieved to come here and see that everyone else sees the new message and can't login as well
---
This I never knew till today!
---
Please fix the level 100 trophy glitch where it doesn’t pop even though hit 100, it’s my last one 😩😩
---
That's awesome, have you enjoyed the changes over the years? I've been a long time fallout fan, but delayed buying f76 as I've never had a good experience playing online before. I wasn't too happy about having to get a psn plus subscription to play this one game! I don't play with a mic and generally avoid other people, but I'm debating trying some teaming up as the posts here suggest it could be fun. If you plug in headphones are you likely to hear everyone else playing?
---
One time SPECIAL reset please.  My group refuses to play until this is done.  You nerfed their entire build Bethesda - I dont agree with them but I dont blame them either.  
---
- Sincerely a fan since FO1 who hasnt played in 3 months...
---
They pushed it back to ensure we got a better product, I think a lot of us would be upset if the vending machine took our rare guns
---
Probably because molerats are low level creatures, and robots can be made more powerful?
---
I for one am glad they did this. Suck it up 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
My favorite is three star gulpers just booking it away at full Sprint for no damn reason. They're so fast.
---
You must be fun at parties. Also it is mentioned in the roadmap if you cared to look under the Nuclear Winter section. [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019)
---
**GODD HOWARD HAS SPOKEN**
---
Good. 
---
Lots of new content in the past month. Improved (but not perfect) server stability. 
---
PvP players have their own server, which makes the rest of us happy.
---
God I am so hyped for that Excavator skin, I am SO glad I decided to wait on buying the black and red
---
Bethesda really coming for my wallet with this one, I desperately need the Sheepsquatch plushie, the Deathclaw rug, and the letters
---
Chaotic neutral I like it
---
Okay, but how *were* they?
---
Yup, stop it before it becomes a problem.
---
Its nice they solved the real problems that needed fixing like flare guns counting towards killing things lol
---
Yes! And martial artist. I was thinking of easy to misunderstand cards for a new player, but there is no card that increases your damage more than incisior.
---
Do you think I care? I don’t say anything unprovoked. :) as you can see with our what I thought was a fairly civil argument. And fair enough I just wanted to let you know.
---
I have had that happen to where I set the value to zero. I was trying to trade with a friend, and there were too many people to drop it around me.
---
\*POOF\* gone from both inventories.
---
I also had dropped items never appear in bags. That sucks when you are trying to give someone Stimpaks that you don't know SBQ event for example.
---
The last trade I did was to lead them to a dead body and used that. The same would work with any other container. Then it is likely that it won't disappear. The issue with the trading system is around caps. You can't just dump them in the container.
---
Wondering the same as well
---
Just got 800$ back on my taxes, was gonna buy some new stuff for my apartment...  and now they will instead go into the Atom shop it seems.
---
I agree shooting anything hostile haha
---
Stash Tease. Not the good one either.
---
I think Queen of the Hunt is like Ecological Balance and the Camden Park quests.  It trips whenever you're in the region designated as the Mirr.
---
It's an open PvP mode. In Fallout. There are Raiders. There should be an actual reason to do that. 
---
I'm not killing level 15's questing just for my entertainment. I want to fight people my level or higher who are a real fight and I want there to be a reason to do that besides *just* entertainment.
---
I love the game and the new PvP mode is awesome!
---
missed the first gazillion times because I didn't have the game yet so thanks for the answer anyway
---
Beta are prone to changes. You don't say?
---
why all the freemum mechanics then?
---
I got money to spend on my favorite game, hey but not everyone's the same.
---
fuck man i thought the first one was dope, the red/black. im going to have to buy all 4 of these.
---
What if survival wasn’t supposed to be a caps fest? I made a lot of caps too and I’ll miss that. But I think survival is meant to be more than pvp orgies for caps.
---
I’d like to see some other sort of added risk. But this is a BETA. Why are you surprised to see it change?
---
Calm down. Survival wasn't about cap farming.
---
Yeah, I'm on PC
---
If I could get a decent price I'd even start making them again instead of anti-biotics and glowing blood packs which have a better weight to value ratio.
---
LOL!!!!! Fiending...
---
Agree
---
"It tastes like burning"
---
Sure, as long as they are COSMETIC and provide no actual functional advantage over another player.  I'm fine with that.  I was promised that, I will accept that.
---
Crap. Didnt even think about that. Hopefully they register in some system as an enemy still and the underlying code was change for certain items and not either being red for enemy or white for friendly.
---
Now I would pay atoms for a paper bag skin that turned it into [this](https://i.imgur.com/d4gEbSZ.png). Lunchboxes ok, sure, that's neat and all, but this would be atom-worthy.
---
Could be any number of reasons for it to take this long:
---
As of 30 minutes ago, they're still down though.
---
Same dude. Like in fallout 4. Those pa stands
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eQmVlhbjlkX0GzGb7DB3j/inside-the-vault-looking-beyond-patch-8-april-4-2019
---
Bottom of the article;
---
&gt; When the various vendor bots around Appalachia found out we wanted to implement player vending, they weren’t too thrilled with the idea of new competitors encroaching on their turf. We had intended to bring this feature online with Patch 8, but we will need a little more time to do some. . . convincing. As a result, we’re moving player vending to Patch 9, which is currently slated for release in May. We’ll keep you updated and share more details about player vending as we get closer to Patch 9.
---
So does it have two "modes" similar to the older styles?
---
@bethesda
---
@bethesdasupport
---
Awww.
---
Who would have guessed a patch would piss some people off while making others happy?
---
Don't devs know that only one type of gamer is entitled to enjoyment?
---
Thats shit they ruined it ;(
---
Ah yes, I love losing 480 caps per death
---
Me too.
---
Had a lvl 7 attack me (was lvl 63 at the time) and so I killed him. They sought revenge and so I put them down again. This happened 10 more times. I didn't feel bad at first but then it just got boring.
---
Nailed it.
---
Youre the Fallout Santa Clause
---
Do t feel bad I had a high level player come after me was about 30 lvls higher than me tried to kill me I wrecked him and my buddy who was at his base a few seconds away who was like lvl 50 came over and the dude just kept coming back for more so we finally took and stored his junk and went to a different part of the map
---
Apparently it was to some people, why else would they camp at spawn points, killing people before they had a chance to fight back
---
Easy caps and aid/junk items
---
Just think of the themed atom skins or hogzilla drops. TROPHY SKINS! He drops boar tusks and very rare plans. Both are used to make weapon skins with tusks on the barrel or armor skins(pigskin leather armor, give your chest plate a Mohawk down the back). Also king sized pork chops equal to scorch beast meat.
---
The TSE Lever is gonna get you way higher damage if that’s what your looking for
---
It's a little less incentive to be a murder hobo. Which I think could help some rp mechanics in survival, why murder when you can trade?(and then maybe murder if they look like an easy mark)
---
They're probably just removing support for it so you don't hear people's entire household in game chat
---
Well, if they have a bounty. They have a bounty.
---
If you're just stealing their workshiop from them... well, it's a game mechanic... but it's a bit like punching a baby in the face to steal their rattle. Yeah, you've got a new rattle... but...
---
I'm definitely hoping! That issue got me killed quite a few times, and it's a huge pain!
---
Haha
---
I’m not sure what to buy as I only have enough caps for one
---
Plenty of people kill level 15s just for entertainment. After storing my junk/aid and maintaining 0 caps I've had multiple people kill me 10+ times in a row. Right outside Vault 76, at my camp, at a workshop.   
---
It is called Survival mode, which allows for killing people without warning and "roleplaying a raider" but that is not how everyone survives an apocalypse. Overseer would be disappoint in her best and brightest killing each other just because they have stuffed pockets.
---
Depends on the situation. Question is too vague. Also, why do you care? They are wildly different weapons with pros and cons in opposite categories.
---
So after a few months of development they prioritized the things you wanted in the game and you're still salty. Par for the course with this community, I guess.
---
Right!
---
Didn’t we get vendor machine in our CAMP?
---
Got it
---
nice tip thx
---
They know we hate the repair kits, they know we remember the promise of cosmetics only, and they remember promising cosmetics only.
---
If they add the repair kits, it proves they will ignore us on certain things they want, and are willing to break promises. If cosmetics promise was broken, do you think the free DLC will as well?
---
I thought that things would attack your CAMP no matter where you put it?
---
What risk would I have now?
---
I thought it was the old "How do you keep an idiot in suspense?"
---
Insult Bot: "Wait... hold on."
---
Would like for other areas to increase enemies lvls along with ours. It gets old only farming on one side of map
---
Let’s say overall what would you pick just genrally
---
Yes. There's a bar that sells booze around the corner too.
---
Killed her twice yesterday and got crappy one star armor drops and a steadfast shotty. She isnt worth it. 4k ammo and numerous cores for nothing good. Yes, tad salty haha
---
Yes please
---
Ah ok thanks
---
I'm worried that this approach means that if someone that is successful in killing others (either defensive, or otherwise), can rack up kills, abstain from combat, and still be the target of everyone on the map until another player kills more people, which, if there's a few people coming after a player, may take a while.
---
If think something like a windowed kill-to-death ratio might be a better approach, but let's see how this approach turns out.
---
Whenever there is a patch so every couple of weeks or so. Been longer than usual today but it's a big content update. It's normally only for a couple of hours.
---
Getting good at PVP involves some trial and error.  Under the old system, error was way to expensive to bother.
---
I think it's great. Most people hid their caps on an alt.
---
The absolute weakest build is a flamer build. No doubt.
---
VATS not targeting friendlies was also something many people had asked for that they changed.
---
This comment just made my day. Thank You.
---
Mothman skins remain favorite for now.
---
Pushed back until May. They mentioned it awhile ago.
---
Looks like I may play survival 80% of the time now instead of 20% of my time. Losing 300+ caps sucks.  No more!!!
---
That's not horrible. Constantly updating the game?
---
When there is a content patch they are offline for a few hours
---
No offense, but taking the time to read the first 10 headlines on this sub would have given you your answer faster than it took for you to write down your question.
---
Yeah, i know, i'm a bit salty, but every second post being about how long the servers will be down is a little more than annoying. Just ignore me ;-)
---
It's like yes please quite so I can have cleaner servers and better stability lol
---
They should make it like “The Continental” from John Wick as another reddit guy suggested and if your hostile on “company grounds” your excomunicado lol
---
Aside from refusing to buy atomic shop items, the only way we can make an impact is review bombing and convincing others not to purchase the game.
---
Here Bethesda, just take my paycheck now!
---
Stop shit posting on Reddit and go and join a Buddhist monastery. That'll show em.
---
That's not bad.
---
Really depends on what you prefer, I would say the lever action, got more range and I just think it looks nicer, the ghoul slayer bonus on the combat shotgun makes it a bit sweeter a choice but only really if you're going somewhere with ghouls like around whitesprings.
---
Chin up, mate.
---
I pretty much farm West Tek and the golf club 5-10 times a day. With West Tek I notice the legendary enemies will start to go down after alot of farming. But close the app (xb1) and loading back in seems to solve that. To be honest I think it's in my head though because WS will always have at least one 1*
---
uninstall its tracked through the launcher
---
Haven't been paying attention, but have they fixed some full-body outfits removing all your armor pieces, like the Order of Mysteries clothing?
---
There have been NPCs that follow you since launch.
---
There's a sentry bot encounter where it calls you it's commander and acts as a companion until it dies.
---
I can only buy one of them and can’t decide Witch one. I’ve always wanted a explosive shotgun but not sure if it would be better than a TSE
---
Bot says you should have voted for Barron Trump this war would never happen
---
Did you try selling to the vendor anyway? The caps-on-hand count often fails to update until you buy or sell something.
---
Vendor caps are absolutely not shared between players.
---
What do you say if they're in a group?
---
That's just false
---
If you claim a workshop, you agree to PvP. Simple as that. Don't feel bad lol
---
My friend and I claimed this workshop from a level 20-something and killed him a few times. Then we just sat and chatted with him. He said he needed lead so I shot him in the head, then had my friend revive him and I gave him some bulk lead. My friend gave him some lead scrap. Then we killed him just because he was still marked hostile and I dropped salt in the bag. We made sure he got his lead back and then went about our day. 
---
It's all in fun. Oh, also caps. I like caps.
---
Ok thanks man
---
Exactly lol
---
Agreed, it would add so much customization and could create a “junk decoration” market. I’m hoping for next weeks patch.
---
Lost my initial 4 diseases a few days ago after contracting a 5th.. which became the first of the next 4 to be stuck with for days haha.. the resetting timer got me again! Luckily, I was able to walk to Whitespring, and hang out for a while near the fountain.
---
Oh luckily, I thought it was over. Thanks Bud!
---
Dude, if you don't want to fight anyone stay in Adventure mode. There are Raiders in Fallout. It's an open PvP mode. 
---
I want incentives for PvP, so that when I fight someone my level or higher, which I like to do, there is a point. I don't want to kill level 15's doing a quest over and over for my entertainment. I'm not saying "I'm a raider lmao." as some bullshit excuse to harass people in-game.
---
I actually want to roleplay a raider, and have there be a reason, and benefits, and risk to that choice.
---
 Survival offers a mode where that is absolutely something you can do, but now I feel like there's no reason or benefit to attacking other players. It's just me attacking them for no reason. That's not fun.
---
 I don't camp spawns, and I don't camp farming areas. I don't use Assassin's Sentinel with Chameleon because it's bullshit. I like PvP, and the mode that has open PvP should have incentives for it.
---
The point in playing it is so that people that wanted to play the game and not partake in any PvP can do so, and the people who wanted to play the game with unrestricted PvP can also do so, and neither infringes upon the other.
---
They never said "hey here's a new mode for you guys to relentlessly murder each other to make a ton of caps".
---
Also, it's a beta. I'm glad to see them make changes to see how they play out, rather than let the beta run, issues and all, until it's full release (like they do with the actual game beta)
---
Holy. Shit. FINALLY! I want ALL OF THE THINGS. TAKE MY MONEY!
---
Ripper Alley?
---
I wish there was a sheep floor rag making a "meh" sound whenever you step on it.
---
Why would a pvp "tryhard" (god forbid somebody put effort into their hobby) or a whale purchase a repair kit for real money? Either one of these people have enough scrap saved up to make repairing a barely noticeable inconvenience, at worst.
---
I personally don’t think it was supposed to be a cap fest.  Hear hear sir.
---
I have mine set to the scroll wheel click on my mouse, so I can keep killing things AND talk.
---
25% for caps? Really?
---
Didn't it say like a level 100 would stop 15 caps or something?
---
In my opinion that's absolutely rediculous. They just totally removed the high risk high reward part of survival that made it so tense. They have nothing to lose anymore by repeatedly grieving and spawncamping everything in sight
---
I really hope this doesn't spawn an onslaught of level 300 assassin/sentinel builds standing at V76 and train stations.
---
New characters on survival was an extremely hard, but potentially rewarding/profitable experience. If you were able to outplay your high level counterpart it felt like you were rewarded accordingly with a nice chunk of caps that can go toward plans, recipes, weapons ect
---
But as a level 20 survival only character, why would I *ever* try picking a fight with anyone 50-100 anymore? And vice versa what's stopping them from straight up slapping me around everytime they see me knowing they'll only lose 10-20 caps even if I do manage to kill them?
---
you sound fun
---
Wont be home till bout 6pm
---
/r/GamingCircleJerk
---
I've only ever seen insult bot once...
---
Personally I hope they don't ever add companions or NPCs.
---
Thanks for the actual answer, appreciated
---
I only noticed him about a month ago. It must have been in a patch. I see him all the time. I have only been successfully insulted twice. You get an "Insult Report" when he does it added to your inventory. Funny when it works.
---
I've been waiting and super excited every week only to be bummed out :( but hopefully next week...
---
Christopher Walken.
---
(I'd be really surprised if anyone gets this.)
---
They are really out of touch with players. I suspect they are a bunch of seniors who don’t play their own games. People want to PERSONALIZE their stuff, they’d pay real money for their own look. They don’t want to be forced to pay to have certain in-game advantage.
---
Should just be locked behind a quest line. That way its available to all. Get the plan in the end and a few to use throughout the quests. Think itd be much better of doing it if they're stil going to go through with implementing them.
---
I own the official cookbook and have made it several times. It tastes a lot like Mountain Dew, but less artificial (which makes sense since you make it with fresh fruit and ingredients). That is if you consider the cook book canon of course.
---
It makes you watch the clock - now we can ignore it and just play
---
Lmaooo yeah I was banned too 
---
Feelsbadman
---
So, you think others shouldn't play survival mode for "Reasons," and then cry that you don't want to play survival anymore...
---
It's OK kid, there's other Toys and sandboxes.
---
Thank God just tried to log in and thought I got banned for some reason 😂
---
Ghoul Slayer's is a damage boost against a specific type of enemy.
---
Two-shot + explosive is a bigger damage boost against everything. 
---
Go with TSE.
---
Should be able to do it then
---
New content and ALOT of bug fixes just drop a few hours ago. Server stability is pretty good, the patch notes proved that the devs listen to the community. Also did you see the roadmap?
---
The main difference being you can shoot anyone...
---
To a level 50, fully geared alt that has zero caps on him.
---
This is amazing hahaha!  Passive aggressive.  I approve.
---
"And Todd look down and said praise me for I have fixed my own mistake." But no joke I deleted an early vats character I made because the lag in the SBQ fight made vats impossible to use and because you would 90% of the time you would do a 180 to target some guy at your far left and even if you had pacifist on you would waste your crit shot.
---
I'm sure the Toxic Valley will get content pertaining to the Crashed Space Station at some point. Probably some Zetans to go with the one frozen within the Domes as well.
---
thats a really nice build! makes me wish people could make camp locations public and set them as a bar, shop, hotel or a medical place
---
Obviously the first one. The second one is absolute garbage. It is almost same good as vanilla combat shotgun.
---
Those power armor are just in time for my raider character! Its funny how people say she can't be a raider because she wears a mix of armors, but people forget Raider Veterans and Survivalists that use combat armor and metal and Raider Scavvers that use Raider Power Armor, but now Raider Excavator armor is lore?
---
The name implies they'll be editable though.
---
ad victorium!
---
No just looking at treating myself even though I shouldn't haha
---
That's good at least. I heard the negativity and saw it was never in a spot that I had time for it.
---
Damn! Im glad i waiting on the Excavator Skin. The Raider Skin looks sick.
---
They absolutely do care. They want to continue to maintain a playerbase and monetize it over time.
---
That's good to hear I like that!
---
I want Grognak the Excavator
---
I don’t care what level they are if they have a bounty. I look at it like I’m doing them a favor because if their bounty isn’t cleared, it will stay there until someone kills them. I don’t take their loot after I kill them, I just move on. I have plenty of my own junk. 
---
I wish more people would understand how this works instead of coming on here to complain about someone chasing them down when they “only had a 5 cap bounty.” That 5 cap bounty isn’t going away on its own 🤷‍♀️
---
I’m pretty sure any “legacy” energy weapon with explosive works properly. Can’t say for sure about the stat screen, but the projectiles are explosive and you can damage yourself with the AoE so I’d say it works. 
---
I have an explosive cryolator and compared to a vanilla cryolator it did more damage per shot. For what that’s worth
---
Now how about a "new" version of the fuzzy/mole outfits, or at least the heads?
---
Yeah I'm browsing to see where I can get it the cheapest
---
I kill Low level players and destroy there entire camp, once im wanted i let my friend kill me so he’ll get all the caps then he gives me all the caps back and server hop to wherever the poor player went to.
---
On ps4 i got like 2 full sets of lvl 45 from the rose quest wasting space on my mule
---
Yes - usually during Breach and Clear there is  a few of them.  I think they are MoleMiner pets.  
---
I also regularly saw them in FO4, especially the first time you went to Sat. Station Olivia.
---
I am going to keep buying Atoms each month to support the game.  Not a one will be spent on repair kits.
---
They suck, jk exactly what I will  do.
---
You really have no sweet clue how software development works. You should dive into the subject. It may allow you to understand the process and debunk this idea that someone just decide to plop something into the game one evening.
---
(Witty comment disagreeing with you)
---
He could had gotten it from before the festival thing started , based on sole numbers of subscribers on this sub nobody has come forward and said I got it and have actual proof ( video )
---
For the 100th time, NO ONE knows, server will be up when maintenance is ready.
---
 [https://bethesda.net/community/topic/334297/fallout-76-maintenance-april-9-2019/5](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/334297/fallout-76-maintenance-april-9-2019/5)
---
They added them all up to elder with the last patch 👍
---
Cancer. Quite literally
---
Got it, thanks
---
&gt;Dude, if you don't want to fight anyone stay in Adventure mode
---
Don't be daft, i said survival is like any survival games such as DayZ. Massive map, you do shit and you can also hunt other players. It's focused on survival, not on PvP. This is the game mode formula that Fo76 tries to emulate. You can pvp but that's not the focus. 
---
&gt;I actually want to roleplay a raider, and have there be a reason, and benefits, and risk to that choice.
---
&gt;It's just me attacking them for no reason. 
---
But you said it yourself, you want to rp as a raider. that should be enough of a reason. And stop whining, you will still get caps and as i mentioned before nobody knows how many aid items people will drop. Just wait, test it out and make your post later on. It's pretty dumb to whine before you had the chance to play it.
---
With the new adjusted death penalties higher level people will start playing the damn mode; because it wasn't fun losing 450+ caps. There is also less down-time between survival sessions since people won't have to farm stimpacks and shit like that. 
---
I don't think you realize that this new re balancing makes it so survival will have more people on at all times.
---
But hey, if you whine for the sake of whining then keep doing that.
---
It is a lot of fun.
---
Good luck.. I'm lvl 135 full rifle and crit build with tse hand made and the lever action. I basically do as much as you do. In order to play the game you need melee or bloodied build.
---
I just want private servers.
---
You could be right, but I’ve definitely seen the affixes for both on standard pipe rifles. Maybe broaden your search and include RoF as well? I think of it as “poor mans explosive” especially on already high rate of fire weapons, I have a bloody .50 cal with 25% RoF and it’s a monster.
---
I’m very thankful that they have been listening and making constant tweaks. It really shows that they are passionate about their products and their users. Granted some of their initial decisions weren’t wise, such as allowing pacifists to be murdered, but it’s never too late to correct mistakes and move forward.
---
Yes it is a good game to start with!
---
I'm not doing it to farm caps. Once again, I am more upset about Aid-drop reduction than caps. 
---
The incentive is open PvP makes 0 sense. I don't want just random firefights for no reason.
---
 I want PvP to be an action that makes sense in the world of the game. I really don't understand why that concept is getting so much pushback right now.
---
I am sorry dear sirs, I missed that.
---
My last screenshot says that it’s in April
---
Thx a lot
---
I can get junk from killing in adventure. I don’t care about the aid. It’s greatly reduced... and why you acting like anybody in survival is carrying around junk? Nobody does their junk runs in survival. Any little junk they acquire gets stashed.  Idc about 10 steel and a couple wood. Plus it’s not like we can even go around hitting up all the common junk spots cause there is no fast travel. The only thing survival has over adventure is the PvP aspect &amp; 20% xp. You remove the incentives for PvP then you just have two of the same servers but one gives more xp.
---
Heck id say more times then not they are marked friendly for me. lol
---
The PvP player might have plenty of scrap saved up, but having an item that now let's them repair an item without having to spend any of the scrap collected puts them at an advantage, because rather than having to go back to a workbench to repair weapons or armor, they can now just pause, use the item to repair whatever needs it, and keep going, and unfortunately there's plenty of those kind of players that find their entire enjoyment out of simply griefing and using whatever advantage, no matter how dirty it might be, to win the online pissing contest they've made for themselves. Different games that offer PvP in some form are great examples of this already; GTA being the best example I can currently think of, with a lot of the vehicles introduced and the methods figured to keep them in a constant loop.
---
Your a mook. Lol plebs and there opinions
---
It might be an Enclave Underarmor, seeing as how the pictures show it being worn with Enclave Scout armor.
---
Just like how the VTU Track Suit was considered Vault Suit Underarmor.
---
Close:

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bbavau/getting_the_dreaded_lack_of_entitlements_message/
---
This downtime is feeling more like Halfe Life 3 right now.
---
This isn't a single player fallout game, so yes, it would be much more than different. You also do not drop junk or aid in any other single player survival mode. So what point was made here? Tf?
---
I think if you have your weapon holstered, you do not appear as hostile.  So might be a way to sneak up on an opponent without being VATS'd right away.
---
Random encounter
---
Players who don't continue giving them money are not income. Therefore, they do not care about the income that they make off of you, because they don't make any.
---
yea, I spoke too soon.
---
If there's a bounty involved and they run away, or they attack first, I'll kill 'em and loot their gold teeth.
---
Just a Bounty? I'll claim it and leave.
---
Take my baggie in front of me? I'll hunt you down, reclaim my stuff and theirs, and set up an artillery barrage for a show of dominance.
---
Thats exactly my thought? Players are always hostile in survival, how will you prevent that. You just shoot at that dude and the second after he turns red to you, no matter if he has is weapon up? Thats something that just needs a testing.
---
If they only seperated PVE and PVP economies this game would be close to be as perfect as it could.
---
Well it's been almost 4 hours, and they're still down lol
---
That's because you didn't learn a BOS Mod for the Combat Armor.  You learned the BOS paint for the Helmet.
---
Ad victoriam brother !
---
Don't wait too long or you'll end up at having a hard time finding those damned feral golfers.  They seem to be about level 9, and don't respawn for higher level players, I have one toon in the 80's that still has not gotten her 10th golfer, while I visited with a level 13-ish toon and they where everywhere!  10 kills to complete the quest in a matter of minutes.
---
thx
---
After grinding the last 3 weeks to get all the current ones it would be a mixed blessing. I would love more, but maybe next patch :)
---
PS4 is 4.5 gig i think.
---
You're right.  Go ahead and build a time machine and take some Bethesda employees with you.  Have them bring the current code back to the past, so it can all be in the release version.  Good thinking.
---
I still get the issue with repairing where my weapon is not being repaired and my junk gets used , sometimes it takes several attempts to fix a weapon wasting alot of items.
---
Sick. Might pick it up later
---
I can finally name my powerfist the "sister fister"
---
Glad to hear!
---
Survival is actually better than adventure now lol. You lose more caps by getting griefed in adventure than you do from getting killed in survival. Tell me that makes sense.
---
Anybody on Xbox does apex ? Lol hmu
---
Tl;dr I campsawn station roofs and now it's literally unplayable?
---
the Pristine Miners uniform is at the Gharran(?) mining headquarters in the SE ash heap. head inside and iirc left, downstairs to a large room where its on a table
---
They could really stand to have a more graceful and descriptive error message for maintenance...
---
Exactly, with your weapon away you should be market as neutral.
---
Serums are now sold at decent prices. You can’t afford c150-200?
---
These are great ideas :)  2 things I noticed though  in the Quality Of Life Wishlist... 
---
1: Intermixed load screens with teammates would be awesome. We should also have an ingame picture sharing option as well. Perhaps with the photo mode update releasing later on?  
---
2: There's an option to select different displays of razorgrain at your camp. When highlighted,  select left or right. I believe it's the same as wild razograin. 
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, cuz I won't be on till later to check for myself.
---
My power armors will be just descriptive of what the frame is for but for my weapons I have a few ideas.
---
For my ts .50 I'm thinking of calling it Ol' Painless
---
For my quad explosive Combat Shotgun I'm thinking Red Mess
---
For my Zealots weightless minigun I'm going with Taggerdy's Revenge
---
I guess they do want more people playing survival too. Less risk is more appealing to your average Fallout player. Remember, the average Fallout player is used to the single player, save whenever play style.
---
It was stated they were coming in the weeks following Patch 8, no hard date was given that I've seen.
---
And if you don't want to spend 9 points in those 3 perks (and you probably shouldn't), put one point in each (+30% damage), not 3 points in one (+20% damage).
---
&gt;But you said it yourself, you want to rp as a raider. that should be enough of a reason. 
---
Raiders get loot.
---
I don't want to engage in random shootouts with whoever I see for 0 reason. I want there PvP combat to feel like it makes sense as an action in the world. 
---
I'm not whining for the sake of whining. Honestly, you're the one insulting people and repeating the exact shit in my original post that you clearly didn't read
---
&gt;With the new adjusted death penalties higher level people will start playing the damn mode; because it wasn't fun losing 450+ caps. There is also less down-time between survival sessions since people won't have to farm stimpacks and shit like that.
---
&gt;I don't think you realize that this new re balancing makes it so survival will have more people on at all times.
---
That's cool though. Take it easy guy.
---
You really have no idea what you're talking about. They ABSOLUTELY want to keep their player numbers as high as possible. Along with average session length it will be one of the two most important metrics for the executives who are in charge of the game.
---
wait till youre looking for regular raider armor, yikes
---
Thats what i meant lol a guy told me online serums sell for 1000 caps and I thought some people sold for less
---
Hi there! I had some personal stuff come up, but I'm still Caps Hunting and there are 2 stashes we missed in Morgantown that I have Confirmed 1, and still need to proof the other. The first is if you are looking at the front of the High School to the left of it is a house with a wraparound porch that has a Cap Stash on the patio table
---
They are annoying but less life-threatening than those scorpions.
---
I try to get a couple tags in with a low level weapon. If no one else tags it then I’ll finish it off, but I don’t mind distracting them to let others get their damage in so we can all win.
---
It's more popular on PS4 then. I always play a bit on adventure before   survival and it's hard to find high lever players since survival launched. There are low level players all over the map.
---
same here, nothing, just hold and stop
---
I don't camp spawn anything. I've literally never camped a station, or whitespring, or West Tek.
---
Me too, and this was to be expected.  This is maybe the best patch I've seen them do and there's only more stuff to come.  Really pleased with the progression of this game.
---
How does player count translate directly into profits? Oh, wait, it doesn't.
---
Is there even a build option for it?
---
You should dive into my post instead of just reading the title.  I clearly mentioned a feature that was present on day one of  their previous title (the ability to name items).  I never accused them of "plopping something into the game one evening."  
---
I said that they omitted something that was a standard feature from day one in one of their own games.
---
Are the servers back up yet?
---
Or rather 2076
---
Not for me...
---
You're better off slotting Pharma Farma to find more healing items.
---
Couldn't have said it any better!
---
Suggestion: Check google or twitter. You'll find your answer really fast. 
---
I just don't get how people miss this stuff and feel the need to come here and post instantly.
---
As someone with one of each, it sounds like a great idea for melee, and a terrible idea for ranged. Until they buff non-sniper/bloodied ranged, tougher enemies would be a salt-fest.
---
Was glad that the update was done after an hour and now this  aargh
---
Thank you very much , I'll delete the trhead now
---
The almighty Ban hammer has blessed your account.
---
A little more clarity on it at least, pretty sure the last time they mentioned it they said "from your stash", and since then I've been wondering if that includes food and weapons. Junk decoration is a huge part of it, but aid/weapons are equally as important to me.
---
You are basically going to get 2 answers for this question
---
1) Players who own the game - It's awesome and fun but like all games has issues that may or may not be fixed at a pace you find acceptable.
---
2) Players who don't own the game but heard about it - game sucks still.
---
I can pass on to you some psn ids from my dealers if you want :)
---
just updated and can't log in now \[4:8:2006\] anyone knows when I'll be able too?
---
I am on cricket watch during SBQ events. I'll get on top of something nearby and just watch everyone else. When I see a little movement I grab my explosive scatter Gatling Plasma and just hose the entire area until I stop seeing the crosshairs flash with hits.
---
There's a \*reason\* I have pacifist on.
---
Woooottt,pew pew we must.
---
Notice how the subreddit isn't being flooded to the point of shutdown with thank you posts? What if they don't hear it?
---
That sounds like a dream. Coming from bo4 hahah microtransactions everywhere!
---
I just... what? 
---
&gt;How does player count translate directly into profits? Oh, wait, it doesn't.
---
It literally does. Player count does directly translate into profits.
---
That raider skin for the power armor looks like something out of Gwar
---
This is where the fun begins
---
Thank god, took forever
---
Rip.
---
Hail sithis
---
Kinda unis survival mod really, now it's no risk to die  no cap farming, dropping less aid.. really not feelin these changes to survival.. if it was to hardcore jus play a dventure mode.. but no now its basicallyfucked for everyone.. good job community
---
That's disappointing. I understand that energy weapons shooting explosive ballistic projectiles wasn't meant to be, but the sheer fact that it still shoots explosive projectiles (and defies existence) implies,it should still be affected, no? But alas, thsn2k you!
---
Hail!
---
In these notes?
---
These all sound great, since the jukebox is basically just playing holotapes itself.
---
While true, songs can cost a bit for licensing and such, the devs should look into this--
---
One of the downsides to Fallout games in general is having the playlist get stale over time, and 76 seems to be especially prone to this. It would be a good idea to look into.
---
New excavator skin is badass!!!!
---
Other than getting killed not much, this makes high levels more likely to stay in a fight longer
---
Damn sorry
---
How do they make money off of some random bloke logging in a few times a week and never giving them any money?
---
Fun fact: My wife has a real life phobia about crickets. I have not brought her into the mire yet, and I am kinda glad she stopped playing for now, because she's gonna shit a brick.
---
I think the cap change was absolutely necessary. I think it was *slightly* to much. I think it should be 50-75% of level instead of 25, but that's really also not what I care about much.
---
I don't like that aid-drop was reduced "drastically" because you shouldn't be able to bring so much aid on you without it being a huge risk.
---
Yep, almost all the way at the bottom.
---
Back up on ps4 now 😀
---
Yay I'm not alone! I have to plug headset in, create a party, switch from party chat to game chat, then toggle the ingame voip option to "None" and back to "Auto" to get sound to come out of my television. It's the only way out of four hours of troubleshooting I was able to get audio. Reinstalling the game for the third time didn't fix it, though I lost all of my photos in doing that so that was cool I guess.
---
I'll do this with mid level characters but not lowbies
---
Here ya go 😁

Ah....you'll recoup it in only 273 more hours if game play. LOL
---
...dude are you ok? Why are you so angry that others enjoy PvP in this game?
---
Woo

+F

play some moar
---
We got Raider Excavator PA. Gonna post a pic in a sec
---
Thank you!!
---
What do you mean? What's my incentive to play survival?
---
I don't think there is one.
---
It's more than already having our money. A game like this is constantly costing my to keep up unlike other games. It's not poor business practice. Learn a thing or two about cost to keep an online game up and ways to keep money incoming...especially with free DLC. 
---
I know, I know we as gamers are expected that $60 from every game being sold should cause them to have money for upkeep for months/ years and our entitlement gets us with that but that's not the case.
---
And if you felt betrayed by a video game (really? Betrayed?) maybe look at your own life on that part.
---
Do we really need yet another thread for everyone to bitch about repair kits?
---
Thanks for sharing, would love to find a clean skii hat +\_+
---
Saw that already, but not everything will be in the Shop day one.
---
Thanks anyways!
---
They're patching this today. Map icon will now be for players killed scoreboard instead of longest surviving.
---
&lt;3
---
It's because legendaries are suppose to be unique and rare, there is no point scrapping even a crappy legendary because it will always be better than a non legendary version. That's was what it felt like in fallout 4 anyway, 76 made use of the legendaries but never changed anything about them.
---
I do feel bad about it sometimes, but I figure that because I don't take their stuff, it's better I kill them than someone else who would.
---
But it depends.  If it's someone who seems to be minding their own business, I'll "ask" with a Heart/Taunt emote if they want me to clear their bounty.
---
HOLY SHIT A BAR.  I've been trying to jury rig some foundations and half walls LIKE AN IDIOT.  I need this!
---
Lol whatever dude. Go tell more people that a live service game doesn't care about player numbers. You've got a solid intellectual position and you can clearly defend it well.
---
Lol dude are you overly sensitive or something? I mean how much of a sensitive little girl do you have to be to find anything I said even remotely aggressive? Please crawl back in your safe space, you aren’t ready for the real world.
---
It means you're not entitled enough to play. You must take to the internet and complain of every balance change, added content, or content you believe should be in the game but is not, and only then will you be allowed to play.
---
In all seriousness, it means servers are down.
---
Ya talk about over reacting!! Repair kits make you unkillable and unstoppable. Clearly whoever uses them will be way OP to the other players lol
---
Ran into a level 15 player.
---
Made him a heavily modded handmade rifle.
---
This is all supercool stuff and I can definitely see myself spend some money on atoms, but what happened to all the things that were datamined last update? A lot of that hasn't been in the store yet.
---
r/decreasinglyverbose
---
thanks for the heads up on these, especially the asylum uniform!!
---
And the death claw rug!!!!!!
---
Just got let in!
---
thanks a ton but no pressure either way!
---
insult bot: "I'm jealous of people who don't know you"
---
That deathclaw pelt is actually a stand in....you get a quest from inspecting where you actually have to go find an Albino Deathclaw Matriarch near an unmarked Deathclaw Nest and defeat it while unarmed and then drag the corpse halfway across Appalachia and back to your CAMP, then skin and stuff it.
---
Then you get the plan to create Deathclaw Pelts.
---
&gt;  Survival - Less aid inventory lost upon death "drastically"  
---
&gt;Survival - Caps lost upon death reduced from 200% of player level to 25
---
The previous system was so obviously  terrible ideas and it shouldn't have taken us pointing that out for them to realize it. 
---
&gt; Item Renaming 
---
Standard feature in Fallout 4,  and something that would obviously be a must in a game like this and yet they didn't do it until we told them to. 
---
Sorry I'm tired of people praising Bethesda for fixing things that should have never been released in the state that they were.
---
No shit Sherlock
---
Best faction, daddy-o.
---
There is a huge QoL difference when you have mutations. I hit harder, run faster, jump higher, fall farther, and at the end of it all heal up without a stimpack. 
---
Marsupial alone changes the way you play the game. Getting swarmed? Well just jump up, pop a few head shots, shimy to the left, spin around, land and carry on.
---
Why? Honest question. I just don’t see a downfall of it being there in one place.
---
Holy shit buddy you're like the meme of the guy freaking out while calling other people snowflakes. It's crazy how on point this is.
---
my wallet is ready, bring em in....
---
Not sure about "again". Baseline raider armor plans were never available at vendors, even during the "BETA". It's probably not intentional though, and they were supposed to be available at either vendors (like leather &amp; combat) or world spawns (like everything else except raider).
---
Except for a few dumb kids all the ‘griefers’ are bunch of retarded low-lives.
---
Ooo is that the Raider excavator skin? I’m not online atm to check
---
I'll check it out!
---
Should be online now
---
Are you on PS4?
---
one time i killed 4 players around level 8 and HHOOLLLY crap they had so much stuff. I felt bad and gave them about 150% of they originally had lmao.
---
The flamer counts as heavy weaponry, so there's that. Flamer fuel falls under energy ammo, and the weapon itself can be affected by that perk that uses flames to heal allies. Super duper and that ammo crafting perk would be a good idea, because you use like 1000 fuel a minute.
---
I appreciate your pleasant reply. Have a great day. 🤗
---
And I'm sorry there's people floating around that no matter what they do all they look at is the negative side.
---
im not bitching on it, I'm asking for opinions
---
i have thought about reperking but currently im like over 12 cards into the build and its kinda disheartening if that is the case. i like being the long-range sneaky build even though I don't pvp
---
Exactly! They post limited time skins and items so you will buy them now with real money if you don’t have enough atoms from in game activities. It’s a business tactic because Bethesda wants more money. That’s why they are releasing the repair kits too.
---
Update: all good! Let's play! :)
---
👍🏻👍🏻
---
Pay attention.
---
I'm getting 25 caps for killing a level 100, and a "Drastically reduced" amount of aid. 
---
You do realize "drastically" reduced is a *big fucking reduction* right? That means you can safely bring out bulk amounts of aid because you're probably only going to lose a handful.
---
It's almost as if the devs don't eat fairy dusts and they actually need to make money to keep the business going (as generous as it already is).
---
Cool story bro.
---
Forest area level 1-10
---
Toxic Valley and Ash Heap area level 10-20
---
Whatever the middle of the map is called level 20-30
---
The Mire and Cranberry Bog area level 30+
---
Just because they're rare I suppose. 
---
But with the legendary vendor that's coming, you'll be able to turn in legendaries to get tokens and roll legendaries you want. 
---
SN: I wonder if that's gonna deal a blow to the player economy, specifically the players that will sell a tse handmade for literally the maximum amount of caps you're allowed to have. I don't have much of an issue with that selling price because people are willing to pay that much. But this will be another way, an in-game one, to go in and get that weapon. Of course, I'm basing this off what I've heard from the game's team. I could have something twisted
---
head to Pleasent Valley, there is a street with several raider vendors and an combat arena, one of the last vendor stations (farthest from top of the world) will spawn ski hats and sometimes they are clean. ive seen two there at once. server hop if it isnt there.
---
See I was pointing out more along the lines of them paying attention to feedback.  But I was thinking about what you pointed out lol.
---
Wait, what? ***WHAT??!?***
---
Yes yes. This is good. /s
---
Witcher 3 shoehorns you into a pre made character with set backstory.
---
Yet it's paraded as the best rpg ever.
---
I have Unstable. I like it because it will stagger creatures on melee, like ghouls. Doesn't really deal damage, but it will help if being swarmed. I also like how they explode on fire because die! Not gonna help in PvP imo
---
*Two* sticks?!
---
How are you spending atoms at WhiteSprings? And you can just rebuild anything you've read the plans on, you shouldn't be buying more plans to the same things you already know.
---
Thats friggen sweet!
---
Maybe not but some people were losing hundreds of items as a result. I mean, reading the big warning before you start might have also prevented that but hey. It also helps for when you get dragged on survival to trade without realising and have to do a mad panic dash to the nearest stash. The leaderboard change is definately for the better. I only went on there last week for the challenge and soon as you heard the ding for top 3 you know that's you dead. At least now people will be hunting someone looking for a fight, not some poor sap trying to score crits with a level 5 pipe gun.
---
"it's not pay to win like everyone says"
---
It would seem you're already quite familiar with the prevailing opinions here. And there is already a megathread of people bitching about repair kits  if anyone needs a refresher.
---
That football outfit seems almost *too* retro for Fallout.
---
Scathing response. I'm shocked you didn't go with a "No u".
---
This
---
Like liquor, and beer, and cough syrup, and kool aid, and grape kool aid, and lemon pledge
---
The items you describe here are cosmetic, I agree they can definitely put display items in the shop I won’t bark at them for it.
---
As long as refrigerators, ammo converters, and food canneries stay out in good. Eg things that confer an in game advantage
---
AS version Repair kits are garbages. Anybody with a hint of common sense would use ingame 200% repair for 50% stat bonus.
---
&gt; reading the big warning before you start might have also prevented that but hey.
---
If you ignored that you deserved to lose your items.
---
All of the other changes are great. Aid-drop reduction is stupid.
---
My friendlist appears to be glitched now, its showing everyone in a completely random order. No longer sorted by online / offline or the alphabet.
---
_Yessiree_, two sticks. Cost me a cap and a leg, but I got _two_ sticks.
---
So Unstable does Rad dmg right? Does that mean it would actually be healing those ghouls? (even though it's staggering them with a hit)
---
Millenials? Too hard to do the hard stuff like looking for answers. Let someone else do the work? (Coming from an old fart. Get off my mutfruit you damn radrats!
---
While I certainly respect the concerns that have been repeated throughout this subreddit about the slippery slope that is 'Basic Repair Kit' I find myself not that concerned with the current implementation.
---
Personally I've never encountered a situation in the game where some vital piece of gear broke and I wasn't in a position to get to a crafting station to repair it.  The niche for these kits seems pretty slim... maybe for players who just can't be bothered to visit a station?
---
I'd say players who don't want to bother with farming materials for repairs (like Ballistic Fiber) but honestly... even if they are too lazy to bother with farming them, they could just buy those items from vendors.  So they would have to be too lazy to farm, too cheap to spend caps, but somehow also be willing to throw down Atoms? Eh... I don't think the Venn diagram for that has a lot of overlap.
---
Yes, it has improved. As to whether it's worth coming back, I'd ask whether you explored everywhere. There's only a little bit of new content. The SBQ/legendary endgame loop is still boring and buggy. I think next week's dungeon will be more reason to re-try the game than this week's mostly-quality-of-life patch.   
---
It also depends what your first toon's build was. If you played range first, it's really fun to build a melee character. If you already built a melee, it's really painful to build for range, since it's so much slower and weaker.
---
I ran into my fist tamed beast last night. I almost shot the sloth till I realized it had an owned tag next to it. 
---
It would help if the health bar on tamed animals showed as yellow and not hostile red.
---
Thanks, I was only joking, sorry.
---
Fantastic stuff! My only concern... the Survival top 3 leaderboard change. 
---
During the double XP weekend, I camped along the Mire/Savage divide border well away from “where the action is” so to speak. Basically, I would do my own thing peacefully on the east side of the map, living in secret, “The Mire Man” as I am.
---
After an hour or so, I’d reach the top 3... . 
---
It’s THIS feeling, the intensity of being hunted... that I MIGHT miss the most. 
---
Many of you will disagree... which is clear from the complaints on this sub plus the number of apparent suicides happening over the weekend (...) 
---
Bethesda, this incredibly intensive cycle of play I found myself in won’t ever happen if I continue to remain peaceful out in the Mire. I just hope I can find new loop that’s just as exciting for me.
---
Yes, THIS! Cant wait to find those plans ♥️
---
Not on this patch
---
:(
---
No players face paints?? Lame
---
Server is up now
---
This.   This right here is the main reason I’m happy about this addition.
---
Is it wrong I’m totally aroused, I’m a hunter in real life this is just amazing, wish we had skull mount options as well
---
But apparently skipped Sentinel, as Paladin is V and Elder is VII.  Seems this user is asking, and hoping, that VI was snuck in.
---
Renaming all my equipted Armor and Used Weapons for them to be on top of the list, just like i had in Fallout 4.
---
I honestly thought there was something wrong with this but couldn't tell if it was just me or not. Glad they fixed this
---
You are a fool, you get neither a bounty for destroying someone’s camp or picking any locks in their camp, literally the only way to get a bounty in survival is by having someone place one on you, I know because I’ve tested this, what in the actual fuck are you talking about lol.
---
wasn't the camera in this update?
---
Similar to Wasted on Nukashine, I suppose. Find a train station to find the poster or go to the Atomic Shop and claim one, then place it in your camp and read it.
---
Even an sbq head !!!!!
---
Yes, the Tnt domes\* there are currently 3 that can be opened using keys. I usally hit these up for the xo1 paint the nuka paint and the colas and then the alien blaster dome for hazmat suits and etc. Will keep an eye on the other domes with future patches.
---
Mountain Dew Baja Blast or Ramune
---
I absolutely see your point, however my counterpoint would be that there indeed is a point to scrap a crappy legendary. Not permitting scrapping, following the line of thought that a crappy legendary is always better than a non-legendary, assumes that all players are only armed with non-legendary weapons. True any legendary is generally superior to any non-legendary variant, but what if I already have the same weapon with 3*** instead of the 1* I’m trying to scrap? 
---
Players wouldn’t be forced to scrap them, But why not give them the option? 
---
Many players own oodles of Legendaries already. Those that do still can’t scrap ones they don’t want. Why not?
---
The argument of not allowing it because of the weapons rarity is not valid as you can freely scrap Faschnat masks, Traveling Leather Coats, Asylum outfits and other extremely rare and valuable outfits without issue. 
---
Thank you to those that have responded thus far. I still don’t get the reasoning, but there’s a lot of things I don’t get. :)
---
He came with the Nukashine update
---
No u!
---
mite fuck around n pay 4 these skinz and workshop items 😳..
---
Something tells me that licensing rights would get in the way of that.  Anyone coming up to your CAMP could hear the music... streamers stumbling across the location could inadvertently violate the DMCA because suddenly their stream is picking up someones "Best of Taylor Swift" playlist... etc.
---
I would love to be wrong though, because having a custom playlist would be awesome for the jukebox.
---
atta boy
---
Oh thanks I didn’t see the free poster when I was checking out the atomic shop. My bad.
---
He only came with the Nukashine DLC, and there aren't a ton of random encounter locations
---
Technically yes. There is nothing saying the 50% chance is effected by the previous outcome. You might consider it “lucky” to flip 1000 heads in a row on a fair coin, but it’s simply a 50% chance whatever way you look at it. However if chances are affected by previous outcome (i.e. there’s an increased chance of getting tails after a heads) then it would be considered lucky.
---
No harm done 😁
---
Then you need to test it again because I’ve gotten one several times for doing it. It’s obviously an oversight by Bethesda since it makes no sense, but trust me it does work.
---
2:12 [Baaaaaa-d Ass](https://youtu.be/U9FkLmMEXKQ)
---
How can you have so many mutations and not be hindered by the massove radiation?
---
I used to think these would drop from big game hunt quest, but couldn't prove/disprove it because of bugged dailies.  I'm guessing they're just not in the available plans yet.
---
I on Xbox 1 and they are up, maybe restart your Xbox/game
---
Yep, r/fo76 accounts for maybe 5% of FO76 players.
---
TotW arena is the best spot to farm for raider PA if you are server hopping. The run from the spawn-in to the arena is pretty short and there are a couple of good loot locations to check on the way.
---
I have them both Unstable Isotope and Electrically Charged. One downside, as of Patch 7, is that while playing in Adventure Mode attacks from other players still trigger the mutations damage on yourself.
---
For example. I play with Pacifist Mode on and twice since Patch 7 I have had people with Unarmed Weapons hitting me so fast that it triggers my Mutations repeatedly which in turn does more damage than Slap Damage was doing to me before. Both times I was doing a Vendor Run and was attacked while bulking items. Just standing there my Mutations took half my health within a minute minute period of time.
---
So having them partially defeats the purpose of Pacifist Mode. In that you take damage when those two Mutations trigger after another Player initiates violence against you.
---
By how much? I think the base value used to be 160?
---
Tl;Dr haven't played fallout because it was a hot mess.
---
Did you just assume my gender?!?!? In this day and age!?!?? Where the fuck is my safe space!
---
Thanks for posting this. I've been waiting until the irrational screeching about P2W to die down before posting anything like this in this sub.
---
This is awesome
---
Wow, some of those PA skins are really bad ass (the raider, warrider and nukashine), but man I don't know why it is, but the vault dweller in the circle of the deathclaw easter eggs really weirds me out. 
---
Seriously, it's creepy.
---
To each their own...
---
Also Metal Stairs for 500!
---
It's only level 30. Dies in like. 1 hit
---
Knew that was coming
---
I am fine with this. But i don’t like the deceptive ways they try to force my hand. I don’t like the feeling of knowing there is a carrot being dangled in front of me. 
---
I will keep pointing to rainbow six siege for the right way to run a game as a service with a cosmetic store.
---
Ahhhhhh yes, the old turn it off and on again. Only a gig to go. Happy wastelanding!
---
https://i.imgur.com/XS3MN0x.png
---
Civil war top hat vendor sell value seems to be cut down from \~38 to \~13. Not completely surprising that they'd change it.
---
More xp, aid, open pvp. It's a survival game, not a cap farm lmao
---
I’m on the game rn, it’s up bro
---
So the experiment I want to do is see how high the damage becomes because you can use pistol and rifle perks at the same time and it has a very high rate of fire with speedy receiver wanted to see if it’s higher dps than a handmade
---
How much can they be sold for?
---
&gt;Where is AWOL?
---
It pops up at Robco, seemingly every 90 minutes or so.
---
&gt;Also, have people given up on Violent Night? 
---
I still run it every time. Even if the Wendigo is only level 45 it's still a great source of XP from the dozens of ghouls.  The other night my buddy and I were almost finished with a silo and I noticed that Violent Night had popped up, so we dropped a nuke on the area on a whim. Sure enough, dozens and dozens of glowing ghouls spawned over the course of the event.
---
Now they are 50. Costumes also need new items to craft.
---
this is a fantastic patch!
---
My game didn't say it needed a update is that ok
---
How much for the plushies? Seriously!
---
I had an all rounder build, bit of strength here, bit of agility and perception there, and lots of charisma and int cause I was the crafter/support of my group.  And yes ive basically done everything one could do prior to the alcohol update, explored and all, even accidentally coming across the enclave without getting the quest that led up to it.
---
Give it time. That big of ideas take time
---
I think this is to encourage people to play survival and it might get raised later.
---
So how much would tickle your fancy?
---
Hrmm ... Absolutely good to know
---
D'you you know if they deal much damage when Pacifist is off? Or even just against non-player enemies?
---
And have you noticed any difference in the damage you take with Class Freak on/off? It's the perk that reduces the penalties of mutations, and I don't know if that extends to the self-damaging effects
---
Same! Keep me in the loop please!
---
Is anyone gonna ask how much hand feels after punching that iron like jaw of that baby?
---
Jesus how did I miss that.
---
What items does it take to make now for the hat?
---
Could be an auto update setting type thing, if your able to play I wouldn't worry.
---
My wife is exactly the same! It took awhile. And honestly she started just discovering things then would have me kill everything then She would take everything possible and either scrap it or sell.it she leveled up super fast then as she got better with that she started wanting to do it by herself now shes pretty good. Shes a higher level than me. We actually just bought her her own ps4 and weve been playing non stop Haha but she likes it so much I got her to try COD MW and because the controls are like fallout she loves it and before she was like 1/25 now she gets pretty good! She knows were you go to not get killed easy but get kills Haha she screamed when she got so many kills in a streak for a Helicopter
---
I want them to add in an area and not tell anyone.
---
Then some day, we hear a loud boom and the earth shakes or something else crazy happens and people are like "wtf." And we get a quest to go investigate.
---
Starch Genes and Class Freak perks.
---
that's actually better, we don't have to scroll through a million plans to get to the ones we want to buy...
---
True.  But I do bulk my items ahead of time throughout the week to save on space (even if it is just plastic weight for most items ).  
---
So vendor and camp are the only spots I ever Bulk.
---
3 Cloth and 1 leather now
---
Yep I hear ya...I have yet to get anything go period in this game in 103 levels now that I have not traded for....
---
Yea oops
---
From an only survival player, I think it's kinda a dick move to force low levels in adventure to pvp, in a sense that is ruining their experience. Or maybe not, really depends on the player. On survival though? I've been one shot by a level 6, no mercy for anyone, you choose thjs lmao
---
In the meantime the Deathclaw rug is way cooler and immersive than the bear skin rug.
---
Well, you just heal the rads. Starched Genes lets you keep mutations so there's no chance of losing them when healing the rads.
---
Can you adjust your sorting to show that result?
---
Lol just a few months ago I was lashed at for retaining a negative opinion about this game and its development. I expect the person's who lavished me with downvotes will expend their energy equally criticising everyone displeased with this predictable clusterfuck.
---
Don’t get me wrong it’s fine if you want to buy skins. It’s your money, after all. I’m just saying most people don’t buy skins even if they have the cash and they couldn’t really care less what other people have. Liking a skin because you think it’s nice is cool; liking a skin because you get some kind of validation for having something other people don’t, isn’t. It’s just sad. Like Asian exchange students at college that lean up against their new sports cars their billionaire parents bought while everyone else walks by. Gonna get noticed but for all the wrong reasons.
---
Stealth rifle is pretty strong solo. You don't say what rifle you're using, but one good legendary star does go a long way. I like Instigating on the high-damage rifles, although you want something else for SBs.
---
Means you're so banned Todd's coming to your house and taking your playstation.
---
Wow wtf that is way to much on that Jesus
---
If that’s true that is good.  I don’t want known on top personally.
---
Each unique vendor in whitesprings has their respective unique plans.
---
...I want a Mothman head in my home. Or a Grafton Mo-- Wait.
---
Thanks, updated the list!
---
it's better than interspersed with the plans you don't know.
---
Looks like they also increased the crafting costs of several headware.
---
Witch Hat costed one cloth and one plastic to make pre-patch. Now it costs 3 plastic, 3 cloth, and 2 rubber.
---
X-01 in black and gold? Brewing station in black and gold?! New Fancy furniture?! Dammit Bethesda, shut up and take my atoms!!!
---
Thank Sithis I didn't spend atoms for all these discounted paintjobs and other stuff, I knew there would be much better alternatives and they're finally here!
---
That new black/gold X-01 skin in 4k is going to be a nice addition to my AXPR mod -))
---
Awesome job, BGS!
---
You really think they designed all these in a week? Lol
---
Finally, one tile stairs!
---
Interesting point and I agree about farming the same 'ole territory, but since lower level players tend to stay in areas that spawn enemies that are pretty much level appropriate for them such as west to mid map, I was thinking more of mid map and eastward needs a boost. I'd hate to wish a level 25 Deathclaw on someone just coming out of the vault, much less a level 120 one popping up in Grafton.  I would like it, but all the level 30's-40's who prowl around that area might think it a bit extreme.
---
Yeah or they put in Assassin monster that only attacks at night and follows you around and its hard to kill
---
I don't see a mention of fixing Speed Demon...
---
Finally good changes for Survival! 
---
Now I won't have to lose thousands of caps just to play.
---
Losing so much caps, not to mention too many aid items, was a huge turn off for the game mode.
---
Plus, this decentivizes players from spawn camping respawn zones.
---
Yeah I understand completely and now can relate. It is a high cost to those of us that really are committed and contribute and I dont want to keep doing it with those that are drive bys and dont have the same intentions. I think I will be much more picky and look around first myself before dumping in all that ammo myself for nothing, just not worth it!
---
wow, first of all this is the largest Fallout map to date, second they are adding dungeons and stuff, and finally, the edges of the map are far from where we can actually go, and I can't confirm this yet but I think we can go further north than we have been able to before, and there are train tracks north of the lumber mill in The Forrest that aren't on the map and I don't think they were there before...
---
And one is even a gorilla!?! New mob??
---
Any word on the Witch Halloween Costume? That was my reliable moneymaker.
---
At a certain point they won’t be lol i mostly use them to buy ballistic fiber anyway since finding it in world is rare as hell
---
And I always asked myself why he was being so nice to me...
---
Ooooo I will explore that
---
&gt; A Vendor from each faction except the Enclave can now be found downstairs in the shops at The Whitespring Resort.
---
\*heavy breathing\*
---
&gt; The pool of 200 Caps that was previously allocated to each Vendor Faction has been merged into one combined pool of 1,400 Caps that is shared across all Factions.
---
\*heavy breathing intensifies\*
---
&gt; Resources that glowing creatures drop as loot in nuke zones, such as Glowing Mass and Hardened Mass, are now instanced for all players who deal damage to those creatures.
---
Oh my yes.
---
&gt; V.A.T.S.: No longer targets friendly or neutral players or creatures.
---
I'll be in my bunk.
---
&gt; New Feature – Item Renaming
---
Question: does this persist if the item is dropped? I sometimes drop off supplies for newbies, but I don't want to confuse them with odd tags and so on.
---
Also good feature!
---
&gt; Stash: The Stash container preview window has been removed, and the transfer menu must be opened to view the contents of the Stash.
---
Oh good. That did never quite make sense. Good change!
---
&gt; Encounters: Fixed a wilderness encounter in which two enemy types would not fight each other as expected. One of the enemies was replaced by Bees and will now correctly fight with Ghouls.
---
"What's this? A random wasteland encounter, **woefully** underpopulated by bees?"
---
I always figured I was simply beneath his notice and not even worth the effort, which is perhaps the most cutting insult of all.
---
&gt; Food: Buffs and other effects applied after consuming food, such as Radstag Meat or Appalachian Chili, now persist across play sessions if the player logs out before the timers for those effects expire.
---
As a drunkard, I thank you. Also please don't mind me, I can find the floor just fine, thanks.
---
&gt; Supply Drops: Nearby players no longer receive the Miscellaneous Objective instructing them to find another player’s Government Supply Drop.
---
So this *was* a bug! Alright, that makes more sense.
---
Related: can we get a more clear indication on the difference between "Steal merely in a karmic sense" and "Steal and also this will make you Wanted"? I like lockpicking... uh... everything, basically, but not if it's gonna start a fight.
---
And finally in slightly more request-ey tone... 
---
CTRL+F "Feed the People": Not found :(
---
Just wanna remind y'all that the Feed the People bug was damn awesome and a lot of us want you to change it back so it gives everyone on the server XP boost food. Or maybe just newbies? Something. I mean we're supposed to feed the people, right?
---
I'll work on a mod for that right away!
---
Well, we don't need it. It would be nice though. I have a feeling one of the final updates this year will add a new area.
---
1) It doesn't work. AA gatling laser kills stuff as fast as a regular gatling laser without the AA prefix. Stabilized is the same. With and without the perk, same damage per shot. Accuracy is improved with the perk (less spread on the shots)
---
2) the AoE effect still works. Demolition expert doesn't increase the damage. Tried on a few weapons (Tse tesla, AAE Gatling laser, be gatling laser, Tse gatling laser, Tse gatling plasma). There is something weird happening, as my Tse gatling laser kills stuff noticeably faster than my 1 star ts gatling laser with the same Miss. Maybe the damage is also applied to each limb? Maybe because it hits AoE explosion hits weak points and that's causing more damage per shot? Who knows...
---
3) grenadier doesn't work. Even on ballistic weapons with explosive 2nd star. Someone tested using pvp - same range for AoE splash damage with and without the perk.
---
Fuck, there go 1000 of my 1,600 Atoms.
---
The base value is the easiest way to say what effects was made. Everyone's actual sale value will be different based on Cha and perks. It looks like the value was cut to 1/3 original value. So your price to sell to vendor will reflect that.
---
With full Unyielding and Hard Bargain lvl 1 they sell for 12 caps. (15 CHR)
---
oh, is it interspersed now?  I haven't checked, guess I just thought they sorted to the bottom now...  probably a bug
---
Base was 150.
---
oof, hopefully they didn't nerf the Civil War Top Hat for how rare that plan is.
---
Don't see any plushies on the Atomic shop just yet.
---
" Black ops is definitely the way to go "
---
That game is shit.
---
they are mixed in with the ones that you don't know.
---
Could you bring back the Medical Malpractice? The prior leader boards setting was a deterrent to even *try* to get it.
---
Damn.
---
I like the idea of putting Z before all my keep items. I'm also going to be putting a C, A, and L on my armor to organize by body part. Maybe even add a type identifier also to differentiate marine, leather, combat, etc.
---
They did. I checked :(
---
Oh god I want everything...got so excited seeing the kegs!
---
doesn't appear so.
---
I was selling civil war top hat for about 38 caps max hard bargain and high charisma.  It is 13 now.
---
They take 3 cloth and 1 leather to make now, up from 1 cloth.
---
Where should I be focusing my early level up points?
---
Back up now
---
Just sounds like me playing the regular game. Once I run passed a player, they'll shoot me, and either kill me or I'll kill them and get nothing :D yeah sounds fun. Doesnt make me actively want to go out and kill people. I'll stay in adventure mode thank you very much
---
How badly did they nerf that one?
---
That and less things lost when killed! SO much caps lost and so many aid items dropped. This is now overall way better and more balanced (to a degree)
---
Better to delay and make sure "it just works".
---
Costs 5 cloth, 5 plastic, and 4 rubber. Value at 100 caps.
---
Not sure if it was any different pre-patch as I never bothered to craft it.
---
Whoa my Excavator is showing the new skull faceplate skin in my stash, yet I don’t have it. Weird (PS4)
---
PC unfortunately
---
Commenting for when someone finds out
---
Types of nukes in this game:
---
1. Mini-Nukes
---
2. ICBM Nukes 
---
3. Nuke mines
---
4. Others I’m sure.
---
Ya gotta be specific man.
---
&gt; Items: Equipping Armor with Cryogenic or Incendiary Legendary Mods no longer causes the wearer to become hostile toward attacking players in Adventure Mode prior to returning fire.
---
Wait, those exist? I have never seen a single piece of armor with either of these effects, not even quest rewards. I recently played fallout 4 again, found one of these, and remembered "oh right, these useless blocking effects exist"
---
&gt; Weapons: The Salvaged Assaultron Head no longer fires all Fusion Cells in a player’s inventory on the first shot.
---
&gt; Weapons: Charged weapons, such as the Salvaged Assaultron Head, now correctly deal increased damage in proportion to the number of times they have been charged.
---
Guess who has a quad assaultron head saved up for months, just waiting for this?
---
YEET
---
Overall looks like a great update, the VATS targeting does not affect me but I know it has been a heavily requested fix, and the railway rifle fix/vendor cap pool is awesome. Only suggestion I can really think of right now is to fix the laser pistol/rifle durability. It was the weapon with the worst durability in the game and you guys raised it by the lowest amount in the last update :(
---
Please do, I think all survival players would appreciate it.
---
I'm sorry I don't have all the "hot games" that are out right now and don't tell me your one of those who play Fortnite
---
Insult Bot: “I heard you like making sh*t posts on reddit.” ;)
---
Marine Tac Helmet might be the new best. 1 glass, plastic, and 3 rubber to make. sells for 25
---
Yeah, it looks like they're on point now with the Atomic Shop items.  I think there are going to be a lot more people grinding for atoms.
---
F*** Bethesda that's a dirty dirty move
---
Thanks for the tip!!! Going to try for it after work!
---
I only skimmed it, but looks like there's a lot of good stuff! My only complaint is, unless I missed it, it seems like there's still no sort of XP sharing for kills made by members of a Team? I haven't had much interest in playing solo lately, but still get on now and then to play with friends, but feeling like I need to race them to get to enemies first, or deliberately change my playstyle to try and ensure everyone gets a chance to deal damage before it dies, both really hinder my enjoyment of the game. And it seems like such a simple idea, and with how many other games do it, I'm still baffled how this one still doesn't... :\\
---
Legit though, Bethesda support says the servers are back up.  The launcher disagrees.
---
Back to youtube for a bit I guess.
---
Bunch of pansies
---
Go to lucky hole mine with excavator power armor arms for lead ore, you ‘ll end up with about 300+ lead scraps after one trip.
---
You’re being downvoted but I agree. I often use weaker weapons on purpose to add a little more challenge and excitement to fights. My first battle with a behemoth was one of the best fights  I’ve had in a Fallout, it was like 5 minutes of him chasing me through the woods, I’d hide, pop out and land a few shots, run, repeat. It was intense and felt awesome when he finally fell. Walking around in god mode one-shotting everything just isn’t as fun for me.
---
And what's the difference smart guy?
---
I can bring 5 stimpacks and i can lose them all. You get my 5 stimpacks.
---
or
---
i can bring 5000 stimpacks and i lose 5. You're still getting 5.
---
Fire rate still wins in PvP so you'll never have enough time to spam 5000 stimpacks.
---
why so defensive? or do you just like being an shoelace to Opel online for no reason? just because my opinion's different than yours? you are kinda sad it seems, i feel sorry for you.  i hope your life gets better
---
Still love ya tho
---
Btw I keep updating this post lmao
---
The mods do stack, in the fact that if you have two of a mod that provides a stat boost, the stat boost will be greater. For example, two calibrated shocks gives more carry weight than a single calibrated shock.
---
I don't think the release was concrete, I think they just said soon
---
Well what is your sell price for them? So we can have an idea
---
FOH with that nonsense..Beth u gotta be kidding me
---
Another plan to hunt down 😐 any idea where?
---
That sucks, but I wouldn't be surprised if they did.
---
Fml the top hats got nerfed
---
Knew this was coming in this patch, been rinsing the sales for past few days.
---
Let's face it tho, it was a bit too good.
---
Noooooooooooooooooooooo........
---
It is around 60 Atoms a day or so for daily challenges and weekly about 150. It makes sense, but it still hurts lol.
---
 Wade airport. There's a green semi trailer with a level 2 lock that has pa in it thats always raider.
---
Care to explain? I mean I'm always down to pvp as well if you're on PS4
---
Did they nerf the marine wetsuit one? That's what i use
---
I met him twice, both times he just kept saying stuff like "hold it right there". Once he started attacking me, but I was fending off a scorched wave so I might have just hit him on accident. I did get the insult note and it was a full printout of the computer class experiment thing
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
&gt; but having an item that now let's them repair an item without having to spend any of the scrap collected puts them at an advantage
---
Firstly, people carry backup weapons and switching to a backup weapon will be faster than opening the pip boy.
---
For people in a party they can teleport home and back to their teammate for free.
---
Secondly, the scrap saved is minor unless it's something you are short on.
---
Other use cases that are ok:
---
Friends want to go dungeon or SBQ and you are short on mats and cannot afford to fast travel to camp.
---
You are a solo player and have a hard time farming nuked flora because you are dependant on others.
---
I agree. I like the shared pool, but there is literally no reason I will ever need to go to Harper's Ferry again. And while I'm pleased with this as I hate that place, it seems like they've made it too easy. There needs to be tradeoffs. So, yes, you can get your caps in at one place, but you should still need to travel to buy plans, mods, etc. like they are doing with the Enclave vendor.
---
Bet they need to fix that dam crooked door on the red cooking stove.
---
No longer worth the effort.  That’s a shame.
---
But about 50% of noise generated, lol  
---
But in all seriousness they said just recently reddit is where they come for their main source of community interaction, so where is this "hotly request" coming from if not from their main source?
---
FUCKKKKKK
---
Yes, that perk does affect those weapons, just not the guns with the explosive legendary affix
---
man this would have been great for Fasnacht!
---
and also still for when im in my camp, i wont be targeting my poor cow anymore when im trying to defend her from ghouls
---
I'm also looking forward to being able to name my PA so I don't have to pull the old ones out when I just want my excavator set haha
---
Aww i just started selling the Hats.
---
People abused it. It was a know item to sell for almost a month and a half now, before the reddit got a hold of it two weeks ago.
---
Oh, okay. That makes a heck of a lot more sense why I never see him. People here are saying that he's been around for a long time haha
---
I've placed 3 monitors in my camp and had to switch each one to "Target Hostiles"
---
On the Free Trader vendors in the Whitesprings crafting room at least. Seems to be working in inventory though
---
Of course. It never made sense that the hat used less materials but sold for 50% more than the civil war suit.
---
Now the pricing makes sense. It also now makes sense to craft the suit over the top hat.
---
3 Hats (6 cloth) + 2 gold scrap not used (9 caps base each) nets you 178 caps (base value)
---
2 suits (6 cloth, 2 gold) nets you 200 caps (base value)
---
I realize that between server costs, development costs, power bills, etc etc, there's a lot more that's needed to keep online games like this going past the $60USD a copy, and that it isn't a sustainable way to do things. I always wasn't the person on the stage during the announcements and discussions who kept making mention that ALL future content would be available for free and no non-cosmetic microtransactions. 
---
I think betrayed is honestly rather apt to use to describe the process of being told one thing by developers such as Peter Hines stating that there'd be only cosmetic items, only for there to be evidence of items such as the fridges repair kits, and ammo converters, that do affect gameplay. If they aren't going to keep their word from what was stated, or something happens to change it, then it shouldn't be considered a bad thing to want what was promised, or to know what changed. 
---
If you're shopping around for a car, and figuring out the best option for you, and you get told that it'll have Bluetooth-enabled speakers, for instance, which sells you on it, only to find out after purchase that you only get them enabled a few months down the road, possibly with an additional charge at that point, and without anything in writing stating that, it'd be a betrayal to your trust and go against the preset terms, as were stated at that time. If that sales person knew to begin with that the Bluetooth wouldn't be available yet, and never bothered to mention it, it's a decision made under false pretense. Now if they knew that beforehand and decided to mention it, allowing one to make a decision with more information, while one might think of it as unsatisfactory, they might also be okay with that approach and decide to still buy the car and just cross that bridge when it comes to it.
---
It really isn't much different of an approach than what's being done by Bethesda.
---
Top hats now cost 3 cloth 1 leather to make and some guy said about 15 caps wtf all the things to fix and they do this?
---
Did they join or replace the vendors from Whitespring that occupied the areas?
---
Yup. With a VATS build you can get a high chance to shoot their fusion cores even when they aren’t exposed. They’re a joke.
---
On your last point, theyre going to alter pacifist mode to not allow any damage to be taken to people or camps, so survival will still be the main way to do pvp. The 25% drop was needed for high levels
---
Hahahaha yessss about time, now you’ll actually have to play and grind for caps, this will help the economy a little bit
---
I love leading low level players through the resort using similar tactics. I preemptively blow up the cars and tell the to stand on top (unless we're near the golf course ledge) and give them the same "tag everything and let me mop them up" tip.
---
I also try to school people on leaving crap they don't need in the ice chest in front of the club house, but most folks at that level need all the caps they can get so I can understand them wanting to run inside and sell everything. 
---
&gt;ANd I enter ever golf nuke with a spare level1 hazmat suit and a stack of molotovs, in case I see a noob.
---
Every time I find myself near Poseidon I make sure to check the roof and grab the level 10 hazmat suit. I've probably given out a dozen of them to level 10-24 players hanging out near the train station during nukes. I've never thought of grabbing molotovs because everyone seems to have a pea shooter they can use, but that's a solid idea.
---
That's what I was thinking, I saw this list and remembered having to scroll much more last time I saw it
---
Nuka Cola is Berry Lemondade? Holy fuck. I love Nuka Cola.
---
Saw same item at the white springs station vendor, for me is was 1900 caps.
---
It's not just Grahm, I spotted another vendor in WS with. I reckon it will be used next week for the burrows.
---
If you guys dont like the fact I'm looking forward to the repair kits dont click on my post simple as that
---
I just saw this and came to post about it! You beat me to it. I have wanted this for AGES!
---
the prior "free" photo mode poses aren't available (looking to the future), but the store shows I currently own the pose.
---
I mean, I'd be TOTALLY OKAY with them nerfing it due to the vendor changes, the 1400caps pooling of all the vendors because they didn't want too many more caps to be flowing into the economy, but for the LOVE OF GOD
---
PLEASE BE TRANSPARENT AND TELL US YOU'RE DOING THIS!!!
---
/u/valseek /u/ladydevann
---
And Enclave plasma rifles! Or at least a way to convert regular ones into Enclave variants
---
No. Late may
---
I see.  Not quite as good as what was previously envisioned with the report.
---
I wonder if there are better sorting options?
---
The damage it does to you is barely noticeable with or without Class Freak. During normal combat the mutations don’t trigger that often. 
---
I avoid PvP all together. I do not take Workshops and I don’t leave Pacifist Mode except the rare bounty hunt, so I can’t comment on its viability in PvP. 
---
If I had to venture a guess the combination of Unstable Isotope and Electrically Charged would both do enough damage to kill a Bloodied/Unyielding player with 50 health or less. My experience is that anyone meleeing you with a high swing speed will trigger those Mutations constantly. You would just have to outlast the other players swings.
---
We have this listed for Patch 9 later this month!
---
No it won’t still can use the hats already found all the easy farming spots just means I’ll be killing more people for loot to take cloth and leather to me they just made raiding that much more prevalent
---
Are marine tactical helmets still good? They sold for like 20 but were only marginally more expensive to craft.
---
:( I found mine near pleasant valley cabins, hopefully you’ll find one there.
---
I have not gotten on to check.
---

This is a bot providing a service. If you have any questions, please [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffo76).[](#AUTOGEN_TSBREPLIEDBOT)
---
Good question, probably those silent lurkers that just submit request tickets?
---
Question now... Do items sort alphabetically by their new name?
---
Makes you have to go get them at least not make them for 1 cloth, that was pathetic
---
Does it say how much you paid for Fallout 76?
---
Do the Sons of Atom earn atoms by worshipping Atom? If so how much in-game radiation absorbed equals 1,000 atoms? 
---
Asking for a friend...
---
How does this have anything to do with being ingnorant?
---
I got one from the first quest!
---
Good.  Pick up guns and loot and sell them
---
Survival is better for PVE players now. You get an experience point bonus, you are hidden on the map as long as you kill nobody, and you barely lose anything for death.
---
Adventure is better for PVP players. More cap rewards for winning and you can easily find workshop owners.
---
EXCAVATOR GETTING THE LOVE IT DESERVES
---
Oh my. Civil war era suits and dresses it is then for me.
---
Sigh ... with CHA 15 and Hard Bargain 3, the Top Hat now sells for 13c.  Used to sell for 35c.  63% nerf.
---
not like anyone lost caps to begin with when everyone was using friends to dump caps to a mule.
---
Can we get stairs without handrails? Or handrails on either side? As well as being offset to the respective side. This way it's not always in the middle.
---
Is it still 1 cloth??
---
The molotovs get the ones pot-shotting would miss. Once the molotov goes off, wait a tic and then you can lay in to the entire crowd. It all goes much faster.
---
Yes it appears they do.
---
I haven't, but I've only read or heard speculation on how that is actually supposed to work, unless I've missed something, which is highly possible.  I'm lvl. 199 and will gladly drop levels if the Legendary moniker is actually worth it.  I mean theoretically, a 50 level char isn't supposed to be any better than a lvl. 199 .  If you discount the weapons and gear accrued by a higher level over the time spent grinding out those levels, then that's true.  But anyway, you make a valid point for a different argument I think.  This was more of a " I wish" post anyway.  Beth may have just the answer in the proposed dungeon quests and other things to come.
---
Oh I agree u need VATS. I was just saying if we had no markers or names above our heads/on the compass VATS would have an added function and VATS builds would as well
---
They should make a tomahawk skin where you throw footballs instead of tomahawks.
---
You sneaky detectives....
---
yes because it is not as easy to craft
---
I mean it's cool as long as they attack you first honestly or are being aggressive, just bullying them while they're chilling though is kind but an a hole thing to do.   
---
For instance, was at Whitesprings building a base out of boredom, a level 50+ or so comes and just starts attacking me. I thumbs down after awhile and do the confused emote but he kept going so I just punched him ,took his stuff and left the server to continue building my beautiful bar. 🤷  
---
Level 180+ btw
---
Yep! Time to finally get back into the game, specifically survival! We'll done Bethesda!
---
As it not knowing what is going on, ignorant of the cause of the caps not being there because Bethesda won't enlighten you.
---
Nope, it is for everyone
---
Maybe, i dont usually wanna call bethesda lyers but in light of trying to add this to the atom shop...
---
I love you Ladydevann! Appreciate the update!
---
Don’t bring in the shitty car comparison. They’re not even comparable in the slightest. One is a $60 game, one is thousands of dollars (depending buying used or new). Gamers love to use buying cars because it goes to show how idiotic they are so they have to use such an extreme example.
---
Got the wolf head plan
---
Now look back at me. I'm on a horse.
---
Thanks for checking. That's a lot more materials and a lot fewer caps, as I recall.
---
The change makes sense, and I can't say I'll miss the grind of looting cafeterias, super duping Halloween costumes and then trudging around to train stations to unload them. But I wish there was an actually fun way of making caps in this game that didn't involve out of game trade boards.
---
Maybe player vending will be that magic bullet.
---
Idk. Look like t-60 to me.
---
Did you also see the animal wall mounts as well. They finally added them!
---
speaking of turrets.... where the heck do I find heavy machine gun and missile turret plan????
---
Stealth nerfs - not surprised.
---
Other clothing items/hats nerfed too?
---
Yeah it seems like a strange reversal, given they had to know the backlash this would create on here.
---
Nice subject change bud
---
Oh god no....
---
Thank you.
---
Nope not really I’ll have all I need to do a weeks run by tonight
---
ugh not again
---
Whoooa ok this went on for long enough you’re starting an intelligent discussion and I’m gonna have to ask you to leave sir
---
Finally. I don’t have to place all five down to get the one I want.
---
Gauntlet doing 500 instead of my usually 900 or so with my health where it’s at. 10 mm doing about 40 less extra
---
What items do you need for those?
---
I was losing 400caps on death, i thought they gonna cap it at 50lvl. Well now i lose 50 caps and need to kill 5ppl to get 50caps :D
---
Was it laying around or a reward?
---
wheeeee yay!!!!
---
I've had a lot of fights in survival pvp. Generally if I see someone, I shoot first, because that's just kind of the rule, and unfortunately, he who shoots first wins 90% of the time.
---
My key to success has been running two accounts, which I realize not everyone can do. I have a low level with a base inside of a satellite dish, and the only way up is filled with traps / mines / turrets. It's pretty hilarious - his base gets a few kills every time I play survival. They rush past the turrets only to run straight onto a spike board trap that sends them off a drop tall enough to kill them, and usually even further off of a cliff.
---
Anyway, I transfer my caps and excess aid / junk to the low level and stash it when my main's stash becomes full. This weekend I was just doing a farming route in survival, but my base kept getting attacked, so I'd have to fast travel back and kill someone. I got so many kills from people attacking my base - everyone wanted that juicy 340's caps, but he had none on him because after every kill I just transferred them over to my alt. I'd feel bad for that, except, I just wanted to farm exp you know?
---
My biggest complaint right now is that the TTK is way too low. I kill people in .2 - .3 seconds usually, and I've been killed that fast too, even with running Empath on my alt, Dodgy, Med-X, etc. Can still get one shot. And honestly assn/sent isn't that much help either. I've killed far more ebay kids with full assn/sent and explosive weapons than I've lost to.
---
Apparently those unlock as rewards on the new quest line... that implies it’s a massive quest line.... 🤯
---
Where do you get the quest?
---
Now look into a mirror... What do you see...
---
I hate the Dr. Seuss houses and the weird non-sensical camps ruining the landscape and my immersion, but I can't fault a single person that decides to build that way because I don't expect someone to spend hours rebuilding every time replacement glitches. I do it, but I've got endless patience. 
---
I kind of wish they'd just allow a lot more collision between objects. How bad would it be if two objects overlap a little bit? Is there a telephone pole going through your house? Kinda cool, actually.
---
That’s amazing keep up the good work!
---
23rd of may
---
Seems to be a trend of whenever something gets too popular Beth sends out the hidden nerf to make it unpopular.
---
I'll have to try this.
---
What's so funny is, my TV is a Sony...
---
It's definitely T-45. The stomach is a dead giveaway.
---
Uh-oh...
---
A reward in the new quest lying Lowe
---
Nuke you send from Silo Alpha
---
Because a level 100 and level 300 are on paper equal, but the 300 had a massive penalty for dying compared to the 100.  With the 25%, it's still a bigger penalty, but not as bad.
---
There needs to be a hard cap on the cap loss.  Plateau at a level equal to that of what a player truly plateau's in terms of real strength.  Sure, from 50 to maybe 90 or so there is some real progress to be made.  But at some point, the level is just a number indicating length of playtime instead of actual character improvement.
---
Did not know that. Looks like it’s going to be a long night. Lol
---
Did you try taking off all perk cards and then putting them back on? I usually have to do that after a patch.
---
No need to nerf this. Sure it’s hella powerful but it’s high risk high reward and balanced well
---
The changes made seem pretty fair, and help to elevate Survival Mode above some half cocked deathmatch. I think they did a nice job with these adjustments and will help to draw more players into Survival.
---
Hell no you shouldn't feel bad!
---
I leveled an alt to 35 Sunday. My friends did the same and made it to 25, 42 and 47. We did it entirely in Survival and we're only using legendary crap we found there. Last night we farmed 2-3k caps each off a team+ of players who averaged level 150ish. I killed a level 255 that had just bashed my level 25 buddy and was watching his rag doll body fly about 200 yards. The right people and the right build coupled with how the game evens out levels can be lethal at low level. Thrown in a useful 1\* legendary and it's game on.
---
p.s. My one friend killed a level 112 at level 15... he did trap him in his maze CAMP but still. :)
---
It's a beta. They tried having massive cap costs for dying in PVP, feedback was that it was too high. Now they're trying a much lower penalty. Personally I think 25% is too low, but at least the mode is more accessible, especially with the leaderboard change. This change also makes it more lucrative to hunt down bounties rather than just killing randos you come across.
---
Guy, you’re being an absolute aggressive asshole for 0 reason. I don’t *only* PvP. As I said, this update reduces *risk* as well as reward. I don’t like that.
---
You shouldn’t be able to bring 5000 Stimpacks with you on a West Tek run in Survival. 
---
That’s just fucking lame. It’s **Survival**. It should be hard. If you bring 5000 stims you should risk those fucking stims. 
---
I like being forced to bring only a handful of stims and other Aid items. 
---
It’s more immersive, more challenging, and overall more fun than being able to mash right on the D-pad and solo any fucking challenge the game has to offer.
---
Yeah it would be nice but I can kinda see why. Funnily enough the day before they got removed I got 2 drop, a flamer and a cryolator. The explosive flamer is one of the funniest weapons I've ever come across. Shame the ammo cost is so harsh.
---
Yes even cures my ears and re irradiated
---
This is insightful, thank you. Possibily just the way the explosive damage is calculated. Even though it doesn't benefit from perks, your TSE Gatling Laser might just get a flat explosive bonus. I saw a post about someone checking out the mechanics of explosive weapons, and how there is an impact damage and then the explosive damage. Not sure if that checks out, as they tested it with missile launchers, but inquiry and your experience is appreciated!
---
I thought Ash Heap was 30+? I've pretty much explored the Toxic Valley. I've been to the Ash Heap twice. First to do Fire Breathers and second to get to Welch.
---
Now I want Excavator PArmor so I'll head back soon.
---
It's a beta, and they clearly don't understand the builds people are using or even seem to grasp the metagame in general.  
---
So from that perspective making the penalties light until they can wrap their heads around the metagame and decide if things like cavaliers/sentinel + assassins is op, if bloodied in general needs a balance pass (and maybe junkies), and so on it makes sense for the risk/reward to be out of whack.
---
Yeah, but this is the end of the game. The literal point of all the play you put into and attention to story you paid. Not just some bug, this is a bug where you go to beat the game, and it just crashes.
---
And they changed the mats needed. Bunch of bullshit.
---
Mines fine.
---
No, they're sorted by signs of the zodiac, if your sign is before the sign of the developer's then it gets sorted before the spot normally taken by previous sign. But it also WHEN you made it is important, there are a lot of angry Libra sign people out there not happy with this sort design.
---
Yeah you will be fine i run them all works fine just have emergency protocol if you have power armor
---
For most people maxed here is what it will take to do your weekly run now for one person
---
1953 cloth per week
---
644 leather per week
---
Selling around 92 hats per day x7 total of 644 caps per week
---
There are usually a handful of unmentioned nerfs.
---
Power Armor Chassis fusion cores being 25% always.  Mayor for a Day safe not refilling anymore.  Etc.
---
Maybe it’s just me then. Hmmm.
---
I use a Vampire Explosive Gatling Plasma as my main, and I use,it as a low-cost BRRRRTTTT alternative to an exploding flamer lol.
---
I call shenanigans.
---
There's a lot of the map they haven't really used yet.  I'm sure future updates will adress this.  Also, subterranian levels are coming next month, I believe.
---
&gt;Bethesda dropped selling prices, the didn’t mention that!
---
&gt;&gt;So is the Halloween Costume Witch dress dropped with 50%
---
#Why did you nerfed that, BETHESDA?
---
We are planning for that to be in Patch 9 later this month
---
The aid lost was honestly a great thing they fixed. It doesn't provide any risks, it just makes you not want to play the game mode. You can't stash every single aid item you have, you have to keep 90% of your aid items on you because it just won't fit in stash. So not being able to store all of your stimpacks, die once, and then lose 100s of stimpacks and various other things along with that was just ridiculous. What's the point of having over 100 aid items drop anyway? After a few kills you'll literally become overencumbered.
---
I have enjoyed the evolution over the years. I even played the clunky Fallout Tactics multi-disc game on PC. I would say they are looong overdue for a base engine upgrade, but it's the universe and mythos that keeps me coming back more than the specific game mechanics. 
---
I also don't play 76 with others. Frankly I think it's counter to the mythos of the Lone Wanderer, which I've always dug. But there are tons of cool people on the servers. I have done some trading and that can be fun, but it's mostly an afterthought for me. 
---
I play with headphones and just mute anyone annoying. It's rare to encounter screeching Minecrafter/Fortniter kids, at least in my experience on PS4. They don't usually have the patience for games like this. That's a good thing. 
---
Fwiw I was a bit surprised at all the hufflepuff around lack of NPC's in 76. I don't really miss them, except for my dog. The absence adds to the sense of desolation, part of the draw for many of us. I also don't expect the "delicate" servers could handle NPC companions in 76, tho. 
---
Feel free to msg me or hit me up on PS if you want to trade or have more old man questions. Either way - cheers, and have fun.
---
Still nets you money and is better than bulking the materials for sale to the vendor.
---
Will do.  No drama.  Lol.  Just want to enjoy gaming.
---
My wife and I are getting take out and doing what antisocial introverted folks like us do and wasting the night on this new awesomeness
---
That is totally reasonable. 
---
I do think they’ll get re-balanced, I’m not trying to like, “take Beth to task” or anything here. 
---
I love most of the update and this is currently my favorite game, I just think this change was too far in one direction.
---
:P
---
Serious though, with the display name being only viewable by the player and not anyone else, I was curious if the real name still existed in the background of "Power Armor Chassis" and was still used for the default sorting purposes.
---
Joined
---
Nooooo!!!! They got rid of the little French bot?
---
I can stash every aid item I have. Sell some shit dude.
---
How much did the price drop, and what did the recipe change to?
---
Yea I've played with it a bit, but who knows at this rate, they seem to add a lot of hidden things during these patches.
---
So you know to do the weekly run will now take 1953 cloth and 644 leather per week to have enough to sel for 7 days
---
so avoid empath and electrically charged. And herd mentality.
---
I like unstable isotope but yeah you should probably avoid that too
---
Thank you. Good to know I haven’t been wasting my time on a placebo lol
---
I’ve never played Skyrim with mods. I’m finding it quite enjoyable and the mods make the game look remastered.
---
I’m not sure. In 2 hours I’ll get on and see. Others are saying it got nerfed
---
I'll just switch back to marine tactical helmet selling. NBD.  or ASS rifles. them muties sure love them.
---
Workbench repair is now tedious, challenges broken and also ridiculous, stash is A instead of x... Can't wait to see what else is awful
---
You only have to be level 20 to do Excavator PA quest.
---
That's comedy. Only Bethesda will need to hot fix PA. 😆
---
Yeah, all ya need are some props and a bit of imagination. I roleplay a VTU student cryogenically frozen in a prototype of the devices used in Vault 111.
---
But it would be cool to have more events, especially if they awarded said props. I can always use more CAMP plans!
---
Shouldn't you be caring for your Constituents mr. mayor? 
---
lol yeah it just seemed like ot would be with vending  but all they new stuff they added are a great hold over till then
---
15 caps for maxed selling and 3 cloth 1 leather now
---
So you liked the old way because you could camp and not pvp and still be on top
---
&gt; Back in our days, we couldn't differentiate power armour chassis one from the other
---
Legendary vendor is coming in a future update, May 23 by the [current roadmap](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019).
---
You must not have a lot of aid items if you can stash them then. 👀
---
Wayyyyyy to big of a nerf
---
3 cloth, 1 leather
---
For fuck's sake.
---
I’ll try those rifles.
---
New QoL degrade with Patch on Xbox one. Friend list no longer prioritizes people playing fo76.
---
I should also share a quick dose of reality: two guys over 100 rocking Assassin's Cav, stealth boys and tesla rifles wiped us out multiple times without dying once. I sure hope they didn't feel bad.
---
My bloodied mm and dc gauntlets are still high but i don't know exactly what the numbers were before the patch. It doesn't look terribly off in my case, if it even is at all.
---
legendaries are the worst teases.. EVER
---
Have you tried actual combat yet?  Then recheck.  I noticed at times during login you can't really tell until you actually hit something and the values change after that.
---
Since Top of the World is on your run, you should jaunt across the hill to White Powder Winter Sports. There's a caps stash beneath the registers in the upper level. Once you've snagged your caps, you can also run across the road to Relay Tower HN-B1-12. There's spawns for both a bobblehead and magazine inside the relay station.
---
this, and also unequipping/re equipping all gear might also fix it.  For bloodied you may even need to heal up to full, remove all perks/items, reset thee game, then re-equip everything and drop your health back down.  
---
If all that has been done and the dmg is still low then yeah, I guess they nerfed it.
---
It better not I played alot of caps for that powder outfit
---
Lol there is always stealth nurfs with every update. No surprise there. But how much can you sell the mutations for now that's the question. Need to login in.
---
Good to know. Thanks.
---
...ees uoy od tahW ...rorrim a otni kool woN
---
Killed a few things as well
---
Each patch makes me want this game more and more, eventually I’ll get my hands on this. Seems like it’s going in the right direction.
---
u did uranium fever recently?
---
This is why you DON'T SAY ANYTHING when you find something wonderful.  NOTHING.  SAY NOTHING.
---
You may feel like you are helping people by spreading the good news.. and you are in the short term.  
---
You all know Bethesda at this point.  They will maintain their grind at all costs.
---
No she’s still there, all the WS bots are there still. They just put those in beside them.
---
Yep, they tempt us with the green shiny glow and then hand out dross 😂😂😂
---
Omg got it, give bone to panter in basement on wall
---
the only constituents I have are transients that come and go, at least they clean up the place while they're here!
---
Thanks so much!
---
Ya I'm normally in the same boat as you PvP wise (except for occasionally taking open Workshops) but I'm slowly prepping one of my characters to hit Survival so I figured I should ask for PvP advice. Great to know it's a solid PvE option though 👍
---
And very reassuring that it's a low self damage too, because I was worried that getting swarmed by smaller enemies would become suicide.
---
So ya, hopefully with the mutations and Reactive Plates, Bloodied Players will have a harder time with me at least lol
---
It's been weeks
---
I’d also like mutant turtles.
---
Surge.
---
I've had him follow me to my camp, then proceed to stand outside my window going "prepare to be insulted" for 20min.
---
I heard good things about Skyrim, I wish i gotten that game instead.
---
That's a wolf
---
Here come the spoilers
---
And what do you buy ATOMs with? I see they skipped the transitive property in your school.
---
Also an issue on xbox1
---
It's ok. I can tell you are the kind of person that will never be happy. They fix 100 things and you focus on the two that are broken. I hope you can drop that pessimism someday and enjoy something.
---
Makes sense to me that it would be most kills, because that's what it's about.
---
But maybe it would be cool if you took down a person with more kills and a higher level you get #1.
---
But this is my thoughts, I dont play PVP. 😊
---
Anywhere where marine plans spawn (train car west of Watoga, Harper's Ferry), no guaranteed spawn ifaik.
---
Hi Bethesda
---
&gt;Mayor for a Day safe not refilling anymore.  Etc.
---
This was actually mentioned in a previous patch dev notes.
---
The shared perks not unsharing is huge for me.
---
Man, yall got sticks?? I’ve just been slapping my hands together since the beta
---
Nope. Just a happy customer who likes that they have fixed so many things this time around
---
well ..bruh..u just hit the lottery..u can get rid of those 6.5-7k and up each
---
Man I need more coffee, I way misread that sentence and spent way too long trying to make sense of it.
---
**UPDATE**
---
So I couldn't find any option to scrap my stored base but the game finally let me put it down after a minute or two of fiddling
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/K43ceJw](https://imgur.com/a/K43ceJw)
---
And people were so quick to praise the patch notes earlier this morning.
---
In regards to craftable beehives, couldn't you just build your camp near beehives?  The bees don't aggro unless you attack them or disturb the hives, so it's not like they'll attack your camp while you are gone.
---
Lol I like your thinking. Good hunting for the both of you!
---
Yup, I posted that here some months ago and Noone had a clue lol
---
Even spent a whole evening finding the song name.
---
Do you have any idea how many military marches the US has?!
---
Don’t worry repair kits are coming... lmao
---
The dates are all on the roadmap
---
I'm  just wondering if anyone has sold power armor. Because if there's no description available to them, then there might be some shifty units flogging off raider sets masquerading as X-01. Guess part of the deal would be seller placing down sets so there's a visual of what the deal is.
---
Your mom is a mole rat queen
---
I haven’t seen this one on the notes, but inspecting items at the vendor seems to be back. \\o/
---
I don't enjoy finding something in big house when marker show you to go upstairs when you actualy have to go to basement. You can see from title that i ask for direction. This is not avengers lol
---
That the fallout franchise is a role playing franchise, which means that regardless of the ability to openly kill others means that there will almost certainly be role playing going on.
---
It isn't just a pvp game, even in a full pvp mode.
---
This is the bigger issue. Particularly the Leather part.  Cloth isn't that hard to come by.
---
They slightly nerfed the civil war era suit as well it's value went from 100 to 80.
---
Ugly one haha
---
Okay! I’ll check it out! Thanks!
---
Not sure why you're getting hit with downvotes.
---
All the points you make are sincere, people thought grieving and spawncamping was bad before but the removal of "high risk" will make this so much worse.
---
Looting people's left over bags off the map was an incredible way to get a boost on a new character, especially when some duper hopped over with his 1000 stimmies and started dying. As you said they were fully capable of stashing all aid minus some food, water and 10 stims. *It's survival, don't carry what you can't afford to lose*
---
Did some quick math in another thread, from the patch notes it it states a level 60 will lose 15 caps upon death now. *15*
---
To put this into basic terms, you'd have to kill a level 60 player, 60 times assuming you don't die yourself, to make 900 caps for a single vendor plan. 
---
Pre patch I thoroughly enjoyed spying a level 100+ running down the road, oblivious to to my whereabouts. It was a fun, risk calculated fight that could potentially be profitable for my effort..now I don't see why I would ever try picking a fight with anyone level 50-150.
---
The potential 50/60 caps *max* I'll gain from the kill does not outweigh the ammo and med loss I'll experience from attempting the hunt anymore. Likewise the high level, early players who took full advantage of the duping fiasco are free to run around TSEing the shit out of anyone who moves with no loss
---
Are you I talking about the ones from data mining? From the atom shop?
---
Which leads to your point of what? The point of PVP is still to kill each other and loot. You're literally going off on a tangent.
---
Maybe that will change now that the eye of sauron won't automatically hit you after a certain period of time. People might actually play the mode full time now.
---
Its really, really weird. They are just giving ammo to those that would love to stick it to Bethesda and F76.
---
I remember hearing about the game map being a lot larger then the play area from somewhere... I don't remember were though. It wasn't like there where new zones outside of the play area, but all of the already existing zones where cut down in size by a fair amount, so an expanded map would be possible at some point in time. Bethesda just needs to feel like they are ready to do so.
---
[Again, I forgot where I found this image and reverse image searches aren't helping, so if anyone can post a link to the original discussion that would be great.](https://i.imgur.com/WMDXLr3.jpg) The map should be self explanatory. The middle square is what we have so far and everything else is unused and undeveloped landscape outside the boundaries
---
Me n MOST players I killed were carrying caps. Some didnt tho but I play fair. I was deffo cap farming on survival so I'm upset lol. But if its more fair and balanced and brings new ppl in I'll take it. I jus love looting ppls chems n caps!!
---
Did you not read my post at all?  I told you exactly what I liked.  I liked to option of either participating in the blood fest AND venturing around the map still having that fear and anxiety of being hunted.  The new system no longer provides an avenue of the game I enjoyed.   Yes, from time to time I chose to camp and prepare for invasion, isn't that what this game is about to an extent?
---
I've just had 4 people attack me at my base when I was giving a level 5 some gear, so that's definitely not an issue (for me at least).
---
As for not being "hunted," there's a few options for that, including the Radio Station. 
---
You can take workshops and stick around to defend them.
---
Or you can camp train stations like a lot of people seem to, somebody's gonna put a bounty on you eventually if you piss them off enough.
---
You are not forced to pvp in the mode. You do realize you can log onto survival mode and do other things right? You can spend all night picking flowers in the mode if you wanted to.
---
I was selling all my excess costumes that I don't use and almost vendored them. I was confused, shocked, and happy to see them.
---
I just updated on Xbox One (standard) and my frame rate is terrible. It’s constant and pretty much unplayable. No smooth picture at all when moving. Anyone else?
---
Good, all 5 of you can keep playing lol
---
This!  They should cap your cap loss at 50 imo.  Players shouldn't be the best spot to farm caps.  You aren't generating currency that way, you're stealing it.  Granted, I think there should be a reward/penalty for pvp.  But I've been avoiding survival simply because of the amount of kills I need to get to compensate for 1 death was absurd.
---
You should be able to turn off in settings
---
1. Stimpacks don't stack so 5000 stimpacks won't mean you can do everything. If you have the healing mutation you'll rarely even have to use stimpacks.
---
2. Not everyone wants to play the same way YOU like playing. If someone wants to bring 5000 stimpacks it's their choice. Maybe you enjoy being forced to bring only 5 stimpacks but you're not the only person playing. 
---
3. A smart raider would only take some items, not most of them so the settlement can survive and prosper. This way the raider can come back another time. You just want people to lose most of their shit and yet you claim that you want to RP as a raider. To me it seems that you're butthurt that you can't take advantage of the poor sods that carried too many aid items with them. 
---
You're upset because the game isn't catering to **your** specific needs.
---
Sharing perks with added Charisma is still bugged :(
---
It says it's "more consistent" which actually means it spoils faster when I fast travel now. So GL.
---
Nah. It’s in the camp menu now.
---
That was my first reaction as well.  Bury the obvious way to do it.
---
I mean, it's a good change, but I never really had a problem with it before. The way people talk, you got hunted down instantly when you hit top three, but I've been in number 1 plenty of times for an hour or more, while going about my business doing quests, and never seen anyone. Don't hang around right next to fast travel stations, and there is almost always someone easier for them to hunt down.
---
Yeah, I mean I'd use mine (for "Xbox on" and stuff) but the Xbox One X doesn't have a port for it and MS doesn't seem to sell the adapter anymore (and getting a knockoff/second hand one is pricey).
---
My favorite part of the update was finally not having to worry about the first thing VATS targets for me in the heat of battle being a friendly. That drove me freaking nuts. Why it took so long for this to be addressed I’ll never understand, but at least it’s finally fixed
---
That warrider skin looks menacing but the most badass in my opinion is the raider excavator power armor
---
I’d kick an orphan down a flight stairs in a nunnery to get an easy in-game way to set up SBQ’s and stuff.
---
I thought part of the point of Kinect was that the Kinect unit itself handled the extra load. I'm surprised games can disable support of it. I figured it'd just emulate being a mic at the system level rather than game level.
---
Totally.
---
Lmfao, can you turn on passive in survival?
---
And adding showcase functionality to the shelves and all other container-like objects so they actually don't just take away budget
---
For every noob I help 5 are clueless and run away from me as I'm dropping them a sweet bag of goodies.
---
I wouldn't disagree with your disagreement on 64 player server. Brofist?
---
Ya I need my armor sets craftable!! Please
---
Gotcha - thanks!
---
Yeah, that one has been broken for a while. :/
---
For me it's about directly being lied to. Their representative said this stuff wouldn't happen. Part of getting the game and saying "oh don't worry, microtransactions will only be cosmetic" was predicated on that. Since they outright are willing to lie on one point, that means you can't trust anything. They could throw a season pass if they wanted now. Sure they said they wouldn't, but apparently they'll say anything if it gets a sale.
---
No Watoga vendor?
---
May I recommend for player trading to choose between a per piece or total price? That way if you’re trying to sell items such as ammunition you have the option to sell at a fractional amount instead of hoping you can trust the other party to complete the transaction appropriately.
---
Or 7600.
---
Honestly I'm getting slightly tired of having to swat lvl 1 &amp; 6 Scorched on half the map and only facing genuine threats in a few key areas. I'd love if they added a separate game-mode aimed at high level players where everything just spawns at max level, basically like inside nuke zones but without the abundant flux and constant radiation (actually I could handle the rads being there too I guess, I just don't wanna destroy the scarcity of flux lol). SBs could be more present, and roaches &amp; morerats could be replaced by more serious threats.
---
Don't get me wrong it's very good for everyone just starting out and working their way up, and for most gameplay in general, but I'd appreciate a separate game-mode aimed at high levels where the whole map is more equally deadly. Give us good reason to finally return to the Toxic Valley and Forest with our high level Characters, after spending so much time in the Mire and Bog haha
---
Cost is different, yes, but it is still a financial decision made built on trust as well as using the information presented to the individual at the time, as well as being as informed as one is able to be. You might think because of the cost difference, that it's therefore an extreme example, but business comes down to the selling of products and services, by trying to convince the consumer that yours is the best for their wants/needs. The used car salesman is doing the same basic job as the E3 showman, by trying to present information about the product in a positive light for both the company and the potential customer, while trying to put a bit of a polish on the things that might be wrong with it.
---
But if it's the cost that makes that argument 'wrong' or 'unfair', then we can compare the $60 game to a $60 meal ordered at a restaurant, where both the waiter and the menu state that the meal, let's say steak and lobster with all the fixings, was to be served on top of an arrangement of leafy greens, yet once its brought out, the 'leafy greens' ends up being much less fancy than was lead on. It still is a disappointment that could easily have been communicated prior, but again, the decision was made based on false information given.
---
Those kind of things could easily be presented in a more honest light by the game developer/used car salesman/waiter/whatever the job is, which can build up more trust between them and the customer, or they can lie, twist the meaning and wording around, and still get the sale but possibly break the consumer's trust. Doesn't matter what the industry is, be it those examples, if it's Joe Schmuck over in Best Buy trying to sell a tv, whether it's the old vacuum salesman, or the roofer trying to convince you to let him fix the roof of your house. It's all the same principles.
---
No, but you can be passive if you so choose.
---
&gt;I just hope I can find new loop that’s as exciting for me.
---
Farm stuff in more populated areas. Should make you feel hunted and on the edge of your seat. 
---
Also i hope you do realize that this was one of the most requested changes for the new survival mode. How is it possible for Bethesda to please everyone?
---
All the vendors I hit up had 3 caps. I only utilized 3 or 4 in the past 24h. Weren't we supposed to be able to sell to all but the Enclave in this spot?
---
Same...  
---
I just started a thread about this..it's not going over well, here is what I said.
---
I really liked the Top 3 being longest life. Reason for this was If I didn't wanna participate in blood fest going on at the WS train-station, eventually I knew those same mass-murders would be coming for me once I hit the Top 3. I liked that fear and anxiety if I just chose to hop around and quest. Now, the new system of Most kills will just turn that slaughter house of WS train-station into full out WW3. I really won't have to worry about anything if I chose not to do that. To me that isn't really any different than Adventure aside from the XP boost.
---
Another reason I forgot to add was now I won't ever have to worry about anyone coming to my camp. I really liked the idea of building and defending my camp with mines, traps and other fun sick things I had in mind.
---
When will we be able to inspect items we are trading to or buying from other players?
---
You can also get shot while picking flowers. So again, what is your point? It is literally a world for PVP. You high or something? Tf
---
Get your nerd rage to proc
---
For me it's not slippery slope on P2W it's "well they've proven they're willing to lie so really backtracking on anything they've said is not off limits". For me blatantly lying is binary, either you don't or you do and I guess they want to admit they do, and when you do you lose all credibility in promises.
---
at first I thought it was raider armor and not excavator
---
If you want to be in the top 3 then go PvP man. This is to help people who dont like PvP but like survival. I love PvP and totally agree with it being the most aggressive players who are hunted.
---
It's got to be a bug, plans and known plans are also randomized st vendors,  very tedious to look through them now.
---
Karma was crap, glad it's gone
---
You’re right, that is one potential outcome. They could monetize the hell out of the game if they wanted to. Will they? We don’t know yet, and ‘yet’ is what makes it upsetting. I’ve seen nothing to suggest they aren’t ignoring their promise to their community despite it being very clear how we feel. Maybe I missed it, but I’m praying they take a step back and honor their word. Cheers, man.
---
I understand most wanted a change, and I’m looking forward to trying out it out later.
---
I'd love to fight a lvl 300 cricket
---
You can also just get a bounty in adventure and it should carry over to survival. Voila now you're visible on the map and people can hunt you.
---
Splendid point! I am melee dominant as I said and I don't use a bloodied build, which is OP for melee. I haven't done much tinkering around with ranged rifles or such in a long time, so I'm ignorant to debate against anyone who does.  I do have some rather nasty big guns and the perks for them.  These are what most think of as being endgame weapons and I only roll them out for the Queen, as the ammo is too expensive for everyday exploring encounters. I can agree they would probably have to make some adjustments to certain weapons if they up the enemy levels, but as I said in another reply,  Bethesda may have just the thing for higher levels in DLC content to come.
---
Hey Bethesda, thank you so much for the fixes on challenges. I've been wondering why megasloths wouldn't count. I just want to note that most of my "discover locations within.." challenges aren't working either. I have all locations discovered, but Clarksburg, Grafton Dam, Wavy Willard's, Monongah, Hornwright Estate, Valley Galleria, and Cranberry Glade don't trigger their intended challenges no matter how many times I walk through them. Just an fyi and I hope it's not too much trouble.
---
Thanks for everything,
---
A die-hard Fallout fan.
---
😂😂😂 and I'm done!
---
I’m sure they will find out if anyone does or doesn’t say anything.
---
Look at the Mom memo..
---
I can get behind that. And make survival 100% like adventure is now. Turn adventure to 0%
---
Well I hope they’re planning on increasing budget size again cause I’m not deleting what I built.
---
I mean, ive had it happen to me and it sucks, but i havent experienced it in a while.
---
I wonder if they brought the adrenal bug back for some people.
---
I did and I'm doing low heat and delicates but nothing's happening
---
Yeah, that's it for me. I don't really care about the kits themselves. If pre-launch they said "cosmetic only microtransactions but down the line we may add shortcut things" then it'd be fine. But when you lie about something you show that nothing you say can be trusted because you're a proven liar. They could add a season pass, sure they said they wouldn't but apparently they say things that aren't true.
---
I mean technically they lied about the canvas bag thing, but that's probably different departments and I get it was probably a (stupid) change due to manufacturing cost/availability right at the wire. I'm only willing to overlook that because they made the offer to make it correct (still waiting on that of course).
---
I always imagine some acid sugar taste, similar to some candy like Bubblizz (blue sparkling/acid cola candy)
---
Playing the game is how I get mine
---
Haha buddy I will wreck you 1v1
---
I think the problem is that, unlike the controller/headset combo, you can't mute the kinect, so even when I have no headset connected or my headset is on mute, my kinect is still transmitting data up to the game. I see my little speaker icon pop up all the time even though I have my headset turned off. I'm really glad they are discontinuing the kinect.
---
So whats the new best way to get things to sell?
---
BS.
---
First It's a pve game they could have adopted a borderlands like architecture and skipped the cost of servers with peer to peer. No one asked for an mmo-persistent world fallout.
---
Second they didn't even put in enough time and money to finish the game in the first place. Because of the rough launch they aren't at all in a position to ask for yet more money as they still have to effectively pay players back for making them test the game for them for the past 5 months. They can either accept a bleeding wallet to rebuild good will, or cut their losses.
---
Third after the battlefront2 and shadow of mordor fiascos a very clear line was drawn by the game industry itself for consumer clarity to try to win back public trust. If it's not purely cosmetic then it's pay to win. Period. Losing that public trust is more financially damaging than this game operating at a loss.
---
massive nerf? I did not read anything how much the damage has gone down?
---
Low heat, delicates and then press the calendar
---
Plans now alphabetize by the name of the plan rather than the '(' from (Known) or the 'P' from Plan. For example Plan: Antique Chairs will now appear above (Known) Plan: Fancy Bed.
---
I enjoyed the known plans immediately stacking at the top of the list, it made sorting through and dropping/storing known plans easier.
---
Yeah just got on and both me and my friends have checked our weapons and they are all down across the board with few exceptions
---
Is there another TNT dome open?
---
YES exactly, I spent time making the experience at my Camp worth the trip if I happened to be there during my loop. Never once did anyone come for me if I was there. I’d only see others at my workshops or events I’d be going to. 
---
This is all Beta so hopefully they are trying out the other extreme here. Maybe they’ll adjust or add a game mode like like Hunter/Hunted (admittedly never tried this)
---
Something something HAVE MAH MONEY!!
---
I may be wrong, but it doesn't look like this was actually implemented yet? Can anyone confirm or deny?
---
Nope. If your camp is set up in what becomes a nuke zone you can expect substantial damage, but, just like the 3 little pigs, depending on your choice of building materials you can limit the amount dealt.
---
I wish there were more shots of that Nukashine power armor; you can tell there's more detail on the shoulders. Looks good!
---
Thank you! Stupid calender hahaha
---
Giant Bullet Proof Rolly Polly's that emit massive amounts of radiation when rolling up in a ball.
---
\[insert dancing crab meme\] 🦀🎶
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
You’d fucking know if anyone would.
---
Where you looking?
---
How much of knock down was it?
---
They keyboard interface in general is all wacky. Like, you navigate the pip boy with WASD but every other thing uses Z and C and shit, so if you have been building your camp and open your pip boy and try to switch tabs, whoops now I'm placing my camp again, goddammit wtf
---
It's like three people designed the menu UI and none of them have ever met or spoken to each other.
---
&gt;Maybe Bethesda are hurting for cash a bit.
---
Oh I hope so they wouldn't learn their lesson if this didn't hurt.
---
All my weapons are the same as they’ve always been. No change in damage.
---
Who even as friends?
---
We could build curved buildings &amp; fencing properly if we allowed overlap. Did you see the junk fencing in fo4? Horrible little gaps in between every one because of no overlap
---
Instigating hunting rifle pre patch: 146 damage
---
Instigating hunting rifle post patch: 146 damage. 
---
I don't know what you're talking about.
---
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
---
Comparing item renaming to fo4 is unfair.  Storing data client side in a sp game is wildly different than doing the same thing server side in an mp game.  
---
Not trying to be snarky, just pointing out the reality.
---
2 is the Alien stuff, right?
---
Back last patch when they added 7, they fixed 2.  It was never supposed to just be sitting around.  There is a mini quest similar to the Key 7 quest which you have to do to find the key.
---
It starts with a Rusted Key you find in the same location as the Alien Blaster.
---
Where is the insult bot? This is the first time I've heard about it.
---
Spawned in my CAMP once. I waited an hour for an insult. Didnt happen, so I killed him and haven't had another since.
---
Yep, speaking from experience, this is a needed feature unless they intend for raiding to be a part of the game.
---
Plans no longer priority alphabetize by (Known) or Plan, but rather by the plan item name.  For example Plan: Antique Chairs will now appear above (Known) Plan: Fancy Bed.
---
We need balaclavas underneath masks.
---
Definitely when it comes to power armor you want to see them throw it down first.  But to start off with, you should be doing trade with people with a pretty good amount of Karma.
---
Given the wording, it makes me think they missed the spoil rate on certain items (they were not spoiling fast enough) and brought them inline with the rest that had already been tweaked to hopefully promote people spending atoms on refrigerators.
---
I don’t remember this in the wizard of oz.... bad joke
---
RIP to everyone who bought these plans off the market for 2-3k Hours, minutes before the patch to use and abuse the new cap pool
---
I dont care about being top 3 or on the leaderboards. I just liked the feeling of being on constant alert once a certain amount of time has passed.
---
It’s like I was Harrison Ford in the movie The Fugitive... Innocent man on the run.
---
Omg this is the worst thing to have ever happened... Completely unplayable!!
---
Also, can we fix the urban armor left arm? Its' ballistic values are lower than the right arm.
---
Not being a bumlick but it's the highlight of this sub for me, makes sticking it through all the circlejerking worth it
---
Hmm... just logging out and back in. Wondered if it was just the game not loading correctly. Couldn't drop certain items also
---
Wooooooo!!!  I already bought one skin for it. And I’m saving my caps for a few mods. But I’m glad too. It’s my favorite armor because I’m a hoarder for sure!
---
Yep maybe this what I’ll have to do.
---
Do you also apply this logic to every day events and interactions? Why not?
---
Now I want an excavator skin with kegs attached to it.. Maybe to the helmet, similar to the beer hat
---
Sure, but that isn't always the case. People can cooperate even when they have the choice to kill each other.
---
Right. So i have that key, and now I go where? Lol
---
I get him on Bots on Parade events. Always (including last night) just tells me to wait or stand by or whatever. I always feel insulted - just not by him.
---
Oh so it does!
---
That is interesting.
---
I could help I love nukes :)
---
They announced a week ago it was delayed until the next patch I believe
---
What about civil war top hat?
---
Mount Blair Trainyard
---
About 4 weeks away.  Welcome to half the anger from last week's ITV announcement.
---
Come on, man. The whole point of this add-on is to be a detective! Figure it out!
---
&gt;forcing people to buy if they want a chance
---
A wee bit of hyperbole there,  no? I cant think of a single instance when a repair kit would have made a bit of difference to me, PVE or PVP...
---
Don't have this one, sorry.
---
**laughs in Blackbird**
---
I've run into something like this recently too, where weapons that I know hit for 900 struggled to get past 500.  It's not a nerf - it's like some effect spontaneously stops working or lags.
---
A couple patches ago, I had a problem where my Instigating knife simply wasnt, well, *Instigating* until I jumped servers.
---
They are all there...
---
Yeah, thank to them for doing their job that should be done very before.
---
 **Escape Artist:** Gaining invisibility from the Chameleon Mutation while already invisible from the Escape Artist Perk, or vice versa, no longer results in permanent invisibility. 
---
....Escape Artist gives you invisibility?
---
If the crossbow has had a buff I won’t complain, I decided earlier I was going to go for some of the atom challenges outside my build like kill 76 scorched with crossbows, even crafted some ammo for the crossbow this morning, I must have had a premonition lol 😂
---
Yeah, that's cool and all but I dont think it was Bethesdas intention here.
---
Civil War Top hat and other plans now have increased crafting cost 3cloth 1 leather and sell for alot less now.  so more or less RIP on that one.
---
Cooperate in killing other people? Wtf are you even talking about lmao
---
Wow, I am gonna uninstall after this
---
I believe you have to go to Freddy's House of Scares (or what ever that is) there is a door that requires the rusted key on the roof.
---
From there, it's a decent length back and forth between areas and codes and keys, what not.  You can find walkthroughs online if youtube is your thing.  Or you can try to sort it out yourself, if you want the challenge.
---
Patch 9 due May 7
---
Yesterday I had someone pvp me for the one at Poseidon,of course i tried to fight him off  got killed twice for it and then i just gave up and server hopped and let him have it, wasn't worth the fighting for it.
---
I use to use the marine  tactical helmet, curious if that was nerfed as well
---
yeah i am confused. they all share the same cap pool for me.
---
Okay. So it's not rusty key then mount Blair. Just making sure. I'll figure it out :)
---
I think the best thing to do would be make it aid/ammo only. And for sure a max limit. Until we have a setup where different toons on the same account can store a stash that makes it really unbalanced for anyone who is a solo player.  With Super Duper, anything you can craft really isn't an issue to have shared since you can farm and make a lot of shit real quick anyways.  But I can't bank my sweet 3 star weapon I found that my build doesn't use for a character that does, so having an entire guild full of people just dumping legendaries into a stash kinda forces you to be a part of a guild.
---
Yeah my bad... quit everything and cycled the xbox and it seems to have gone back to normal. My friends was exactly the same though. Very weird
---
Lol such an edge lord. I don’t play those games.
---
That's why I created a twink just for pvp... don't see any problems at all?
---
So does the zealots armor work vs scorch beasts as well?
---
Same, it's selling price is also now 1/3 what it used to be. This wasn't in the patch notes of course.
---
Stop spreading false info lmao
---
Same and they only sell for 12 caps now.
---
It could be. once it was my bed, them another time my armor bench, which was barely touching a second floor tile. This game gets weird sometimes about stuff like that, and then you place a 12 story house 23 tiles wide perfectly fine hanging off a cliff.
---
He was broken until todays patch. He should actually work now.
---
Weapon seems to vary day by day almost but yeah its probably an error rather than anything else
---
They kinda did that a couple patches ago. They dialed the cost of turrets way down but you can only have so many of them.
---
How would Survival be any different from Adventure mode if players choose not to PvP in Survival?
---
Sorry about that currently the best one i have been able to make is the Recon Hardened Piercing Sniper rifle (the one that uses .308 rounds
---
So if a player is marked as neutral with their weapon holstered (per previous patch notes) and VATS will not target neutral players, this means a sneak-sniper, critical VATS headshot is off the table as the opening volley in a PvP interaction.  Unless there is something I'm overlooking?
---
It's been around since beta. had my friend quit because of this
---
That's the same number as their ridiculous challenge to earn atoms.
---
Explore Appalachia for 7600 hours and we'll give you a measly 20 atoms for all the time you've spent playing our game.
---
On a real note though, I love the fact all the vendor factions are at Whitespring now and they all share the same cap pool. It's super convenient now to obtain caps without having to spend any to fast travel.
---
I know calibrated works, but do the others?
---
I haven't seen A rad storm in weeks.
---
Please, that'd be great. Thanks.
---
Oh come on. Nerfing Civil War Hats? 3 cloth, 1 leather and only 12 caps per?
---
And civil war hats have had their selling price massively reduced.
---
But hey we can name stuff now.
---
Thats my thoughts too! Think that bethesdas calculation won't work a long term.
---
TankdonutsJr your build is probably garbage
---
Those lockers in the Ash Heap were bugged and were never supposed to have the key. You have to go through a fun little mini-quest to get it. Very similar to the new dome 7 quest in that they both have very hidden locations and one-time passwords. Here's a full walkthrough to get it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7pSKBuVIiE
---
Why?
---
Your back strong enough man?
---
You can either build extremely massive with next to no furniture and decorations, or build way smaller with a dense amount of furniture and decorations to fill everything (I prefer this). Even if you build somewhat small, you can't really decorate THAT much.
---
It was inevitable. Gotta make those free Atoms harder and harder to get.
---
They are purposely designed so most people don't complete them.
---
More xp, limited fast travel, risk of being killed by other players randomly, no respawn at same location as death, playernlootbags marked on the map, ect.
---
This guy drives a Rocket 69.
---
WTF...
---
Nothing will survive an ICBM nuke, except radroaches.
---
It now sells for 11 caps and costs 3 cloth and 1 leather.
---
Cool I can wait to be insulted on my choice of armor mods.
---
Who are you?
---
500lbs of hats on 4 toons and now i don't have to travel for cap limit ;) but they only sell for 5caps without perks now
---
It's much easier if you know the formula
---
@1 Charisma = Sells for 10% of Value (it's 50 now down from 150), so it sells for 5 on a 1 charisma character.
---
At 20 or more, it sells for 25%  of sell value, so that's 12.5, rounded to 13 caps.
---
Hard Bargain acts as a flat +9 Charisma.
---
So to be technical it's a 66% nerf, but due to rounding it is off a bit.
---
Also this formula applies to all items, so you can see sell-value calculation pretty quickly for any item.
---
Nuclear Winter obviously
---
I feel like witch dress is also cost more to craft now. 5 plastic, 5 rubber and some cloth. It was 5 plastic + 2 cloth, as I remember. But worst thing is - its base value was reduced to 100 caps from 200, so it is two times cheaper to sell.
---
Its a long way to L50, and your (perk) needs will change over time.
---
My method was to select the perks that helped me at the moment.  
---
(For the way perks work in 76, I know now that was shortsighted, but I didn't know any better at the time.)
---
Since I was successful with a machete and fireaxe, I selected perks which benefited those weapons.
---
I carried a lot of junk, so needed weight reduction/carrying capacity perks.  
---
High strength improves both of those aspects.
---
stim/chem/food duration perks were helpful.  Good Doggy :)
---
I found a sniper rifle early on.  I liked its performance, so I added a couple of rifle perks.
---
What that method ended up doing was making my character melee as primary and sniper secondary.
---
Which is really different, as in all other iterations of fallout, i was always auto-rifle.
---
But I've had great fun along the way, and occasionally wonder what earlier fallouts would be like as melee instead of rifle.
---
Anyway, @ L57, I have strength maxed out, perception is not far behind.  but charisma and luck are only 3's.
---
I have no pistol, shotgun, or heavy weapons perks.  
---
I play solo most of the time, so the team oriented charisma perks were not useful, excetpt lone wanderer and the one that "forces" enemies to give up an additional 5% damage were, both of whihc I have equipped.
---
Just got the sheepsquatch mascot head after completing the event.
---
my weapon of choice is a gun, i dont find melee particularly useful against flying targets
---
Wolf
---
Damn stop down voting I want to know why he doesn't want them. Maybe he has a good point
---
The repair kit controversy is kind of funny to me. On the one hand, I absolutely do not need to buy repair kits, ever, and I won't. I repair my gear once every few days at most. Seriously takes me ages to wear down my .50 cals and gatling gun. Power armor gets repaired once every other week at most. So they don't really add anything for me. AND YET, they are technically a game affecting item, which is bullshit and starts BGS down a dangerous path, so people obviously had a kneejerk reaction.
---
Seriously, all we want are power armor stands to display our power armor collection, mannequins to display armor sets, bobblehead stands, magazine racks, mounted creature heads, etc. There's a gold mine of opportunity for BGS if they just understand their playerbase better and create the things we're asking for.
---
Its almost as if that's the nature of tinkering with a huge online game and always has been
---
lul that's exactly the problem. Having to start a new character just to pvp. Not everyone have much free time on their hands
---
And then you track down who sent the assassin and it turns into this whole plot of a god seeking to assassinate other gods and use you as a marytr to cement her own decling power.
---
Faction vendors share caps! How is everyone forgetting that? That is awesome!
---
I love survival but Im glad they made those changes that quick. Really want it to be populated and fun for everybody so I can keep killing them.
---
Equipping a weapon takes time, time you have to VATS kill someone.
---
I think part of the problem is you have had a lot of people create different and new (lower level) characters and with some of the weapon and armor balancing they could compete with higher levels with almost zero risk- very little cap loss cost.  Now, you should see a lot more whales competing and the losses won’t be as significant.  This should drive a lot more people to survival mode.
---
THANK YOU
---
Read the notes. It’s that simple.
---
Just read the notes
---
The fact that you can't or don't want to use your existing player because of the unbalanced penalty is exactly the problem.  You took a step to avoid the problem, but say you can't see the problem?
---
With the bone?
---
Ah... I missed that announcement too. Bummer!
---
Im suddenly glad I stockpiled 2k cloth.
---
A tiny pebble.
---
How do you get these?
---
Wow this one is pretty long.
---
Could I buy some if you are selling? I’m also on xbox.
---
Nah I’m past that. It’s after you go to the top of the garrahan estate
---
I wish the custom names could be longer. My idea was to rename it keeping the original name but adding tags to the beginning for sorting them and that doesn’t work because the default names are much longer than the custom names allow.
---
Dang.... I might actually have to buy atoms now
---
The data will always show who is selling what and how many.  No need to downvote this guy.
---
This isn't like Nuka-Shine where the "mystery" is just seeing where everyone is congregated, is it? XD
---
Lots of great items this time around. I see myself buying a few of those outfits and camp items.
---
But still no hairstyles, huh?
---
A lot longer than that.
---
It sounds like you might have your speakers set to 5.1 without a center channel.
---
Friends list is the same way with online and offline friends intertwined
---
They should really up the frequency of them in game
---
Because mole rats use fast travel all the time, so they aren't encountering random mobs to level.
---
P.S. Fuck mole rats.
---
Check the back/front of the car.
---
Well with some restraint you can self limit fast travel in adventure so that doesn’t really count. More XP is great, since you mentioned Bethesda’s  Intentions I’d assume they’d rather not have players in Survival only for this. 
---
Just seems like there are Survival aspects and PvP aspects that mesh a bit and for now at least they are putting more attention on PvP.
---
I didn’t. Just a comment
---
After that is where I’m stuck I got the cashe
---
Yeah, I know, but someone downvoted you.  I was defending you :P
---
They will do that too, but they can cooperate with whomever they want. No one is forced to PVP all the time.
---
Yeah I saw this coming, but they are just making it impossible now then tedious, like their is a weekly challenge for hunter/hunted not everyone wants to do pvp and even with this weekly good luck finding 4 people in a server to do it probably.
---
&gt; kill a glowing creature in a rad storm
---
&gt;level up three times
---
Wait, those are dailies?  Not Weeklies?  That seems pretty unbalanced.  Leveling up 3 times in a single day of play?  Finding a Rad Storm is rare enough for a month of playtime, let alone a day...  Then finding a glowing enemy that happens to be in the same area before it ends?
---
Personally I have only found half a dozen rad storms in the 400+ hours of playtime, and it's always been around the forest area near Flatwoods.
---
At least you all have opposable thumbs. Learn to play with a flagella scrub.
---
they also nerfed..hats if you crafted them for caps..and they nerfed melee significantly..you are right..excellent update
---
They can also kill because that's the point of the server. Still waiting for your point.
---
Same. I have a pretty nice setup around nuke zones and like to lure masses of enemies or scorchbeasts to help with xp. I'm excited to see them ravage some scorchbeasts now.
---
Anything else we can make with just cloth? I saved up a bunch.
---
Great reference 👍
---
I saw one the other day.  But they only last a minute or two in my experience.
---
Nah there’s some tricky stuff inside of building that people seem to be struggling with.
---
I feel 25% of caps is too low, thats not enough consequence with death. People might revert back to adventure to farm people for caps
---
Just got back on, I have an exploding lever action rifle that's taking up space in my stash if you want to try that out! When are you on?
---
It was a good run while it lasted.
---
Oh well. Life goes on.
---
IKR? Everything I'd read about the game in online articles talked about what a great place it was to set up your CAMP because the robots would protect you. I got there at level 16 and was immediately jumped by a herd of level 68 ghouls. Went back to get my junk and tried hiding behind a robot; ended clipping it accidentally. I didn't go back until I was level 50+.
---
Awesome - definitely booting up 76 after work, 2 GB patch, will be ready in no time!
---
Gonna hunt me some Samsquanches, err I mean Sheepsquatches
---
That is the thought process, yes, but more importantly IMO is that vats will no longer be able to be used to find player targets for you. As it is now you can just tap vats while spinning around real quick and it will auto target people that are say "hiding" in a bush. There is a chance because of natural camouflage that you would never see them but because of vats they are instantly found. I don't really like giving campers an advantage, but vats spotting was too damn cheesy for my liking.
---
This type if crap really pisses me off. After stealth nerfs in one of the earliest patches, they promised more transparency, as in everything would be in patch notes.   After one of the patches almost every single fusion core found in armor is 25 percent.  Not in the patch notes.  And Bethesda is silent when confronted about it. 
---
Don't have the top hat plans but was looking for them. Sounds like isn't quite as worthwhile now.
---
That is some forward thinking.
---
!!!! NOOOOO
---
Radroaches and Cave Crickets mostly.
---
It's nice to find Rad Ants though, now that I can make a drink from their meat.
---
Even still. They will never make or break a combat situation, and in the **insanely** rare occurrence that they do, it will only take one. A stockpile will never mean a victory.
---
Wouldn't be terrible.  Also not just unequip, always put away (drop their guard).  Even holding your fists out counts as holding a weapon.
---
I have yet to confirm if the non-hostile weapon away makes you untargetable in survival though.
---
Or just go to a location like candem park, kill all the scorched loot their weapons, loot the entire place and sell everything for a good 500-700 caps. Do that in a few different locations and money earned, it will be easier for me now since the Vendors have 1400 caps, no need to worry about fast traveling.
---
good update thanks but when can we put a lock on certain weapons and armor so we wont accidentally drop them?
---
Yea I rarely see rad ants
---
NERFED CIVIL WAR TOP HAT CREATION AND SALE. My pocketbook is weeping.
---
no no no no no is the union hat safe
---
Honest question, not trolling.
---
So like, why is everyone so pissed about spending real money on a kit that repairs your gear to, let's be honest 50% past level ... 40ish?
---
If you're not stocking items to repair gear you use on the regular, what the hell are you even doing? At my level, as soon as my item says it can be repaired, it goes to 200%. This kit costs money and only goes to 100.
---
The way I see it, this will go one of 2 ways.
---
1: Butthurt people and people who don't care WON'T BUY THE REPAIR KITS. This being apparently everyone on the internet ever, will make Bethesda no money and it will be a failed attempt at the introduction of a new mechanic. 
---
2: people will bit them and discover that they rapidly become obsolete, as if they were ever even necessary, and they'll join the crowd from #1.
---
I know people are gonna talk about slippery slope and whatnot but we'll burn that bridge when we get there. If they start selling 2 shot explosive sledgehammers and shit I'll start getting mad. Until then, I'll just be over here having enough resources to repair my kit to a much more effective level than the guy whose wallet is lighter because he couldn't be bothered to carry an alarm clock home.
---
I will make base look like radroaches now
---
I believe the binoculars are a "weapon" as well
---
Repairing items now requires you to inspect them, but then it bugs out and you can't see the condition of other items until you exit/re-enter the workbench.
---
MODUS production terminal.
---
Good now maybe people like you will just play the game instead of pushing the easy mode button
---
And dude I don't give a shit about your kd it's fucking fallout and you're most likely using the same lame ass duped gear with the exact same perk set up that you had to look up online just like every other Tom Mary and dick that spawn camps
---
Does it hurt being a carbon copy?
---
Me to. Any others just use cloth?
---
My friend had an issue and I thought he was the only one, glad to see it's everyone lol
---
only animals
---
500, with maxed charisma and hard barter 3.
---
Vendors sell them.  Check the new whitespring vendor pool.
---
OH SHIT!
---
They are trying to suck caps out of the economy aren't they?
---
Now that the cap pool is 1400 people can sell more expensive things, and other people can buy them at a much higher price.  And shopping is easier now than ever before.
---
BTW, anyone tried the new shopping center in Survival? I'm sure it's an absolute bloodbath right now.
---
In your game they are affected by previous outcomes. You only have a 50% chance to even flip the second coin, and a 25% chance to even flip the third. Even if you just flipped them all at once you are still only 3.125% to hit heads each time. Now if I’m misunderstanding how the game works(if, for example, you throw all five switches and however many light up is your result), it’s a mildly fairer game but everything I stated is still true.
---
Seriously, you need to take this to your math teacher or professor or whoever you trust to set you straight, because you aren’t seeing things right.
---
Ive tamed: cat, rabbit, deathclaw, snallygaster, and a bear
---
I didn't try but I noticed that when I completed the previous mission I unlocked the crafting recipe for it.
---
Yep wasted my card didnt know it's impossible aline
---
Lol I'm still getting like 10 good aid items anyone know the new average?
---
I've never seen one and played since Beta.
---
I watched at the lvl 250s fell... chaos for sure
---
What's MODUS?
---
buy it from vendors
---
I built one in the south that incorporates a monorail car. There is also an existing “camp” there with a tent, picknick tables and so on. I added sleeping bags to the tent, along with a stash box, and workbenches all around the camp. Put a fire in the fire pit, and added a bunch of instruments. That part almost looks like it belongs. 
---
I also am trying to build on east of top of the world, across a canyon that has a foot bridge. Supposed to be like Falling Water, but it is on my pvp build and I don’t want to put too much into it.
---
With the new changes today regarding the leaderboard it’s a decent incentive.
---
My melee attacks never connected to begin with. 😔
---
Shhhh don’t tell the guests the real odds
---
If I can't have a gulper I would love a cat, so thanks for that consolation
---
Maybe?
---
Wasted your card?
---
Don't know where you get your leather friend, but I never have too much of it
---
I don't really wear Raider items, but that excavator skin looks so damn awesome.
---
If you dont know now, it'd be a spoiler.
---
How about the union/confederate uniforms? Change there?
---
I've spent $80 on skins I HAVE NOT EVER USED
---
Yes I saw but you still need one from assaultron to craft it. That’s what im asking about
---
Also Server hopping now hoping to find an active one
---
North west of lewisburg, at pylon ambush site
---
Yup.. completed it and I can guarantee you that I won't be doing it again until they fix the framerate/exploding robots/ Continuous pylon damage..
---
Blue Berry Anti-Freeze, little bit of fruitiness with throat burning, mind altering fun. 
---
Coolant comes in a blue bottle...just sayn'
---
Those bastards are getting real-world cash out of me for the second time.
---
I don’t believe survival players are neutral. Would like to see confirmation though.
---
It's one time use you need to craft a New one to start it
---
5 points from Vault 76 for your ignorance, IsoVilkku!
---
Well there is an option for robot registration at the Charleston DMV
---
I had 5, 100+ players my first run and we did it and I got a cool sheepsquatch hat
---
velveteen rabbit :o :o :o
---
You mean how YOU’RE gonna spend your money. I haven’t been tempted by a single one. 
---
I will however purchase the clothes and furniture.
---
If you haven't played since a month into launch you're gonna love it. So much has changed imo.
---
I could only check the cap stashes once during the whole week. Because I was there so much? Idk.
---
Haven't gotten to that point yet, all I saw was the event so I joined. And i fucking hate it
---
Maybe the flare gun should call a robot with brahmin, in which we can leave things and scrap. as a mobile container but with a 1-hour CD
---
Did you honestly think that that transaction that was plastered all over YouTube would never, ever, ever get adjusted?
---
GT?
---
This is absolutely horrific. I’m in it right now close to level 200 and just keep dying. Ridiculously hard! And the time limit makes in impossible.
---
I kept thinking this was the joke. Now I look forward to running into the bot again.
---
No thanks to sniping a level 50 one of those assholes from stealth at max range to have ten of them burrow and appear all around me.  I totally get where you're coming from, but no thanks.
---
Flatwood by church the Brahman spawn fast and there are stags hanging around and a lot spawn too
---
Tried. It, exactly the same experience, everyone confused? What are we missing, there must be something?
---
I can’t do it :(
---
Honestly, the only spoilers I care about is for shows or an anime I am really into. Game spoilers are a meh to me. spoil it pl0x
---
I would almost rather fight a Scorchbeast than a level 52 ballistic Colonel Gusty.
---
I’m the  guy that wrecks people like you on survival
---
I have been using the top hat for vendors for around 2 months now and in all honesty it did make my gameplay quicker not having to worry about grinding too hard for those caps it meant I could enjoy gameplay more, I dont see it as the end of the world though, before I had the plan I was content enough running west tek for assault rifles the xp was better than crafting the hats too!
---
I think that's the Shopping Mall.
---
Only one not there is the Enclave.  But I think they said that during the announcement.
---
At least the Enclave is close by.
---
Max vendor, 7 charisma pts, can sell for 29. No change for me that I can see.
---
Strip the parts and sell them individually after you drop the chassis.
---
Any shot at a SPECIAL respec? My group refuses to play after the January nerfs so I dont get to play.  The fact you nerfed the game then ignored how this might affect people who only play 4-8hours a week was frustrating.  The longer it goes ignored that bleeds into genuine anger.  I understand there are issues with higher urgency levels but if you want to lure lost players back this could work.
---
wow indeed. it's perfect. I'm on the verge of crying tears of joy.
---
I'm sad this is gone but honestly it needed to be nerfed.
---
I think we can agree that cool looking vanity items in general will be the ticket.
---
Gamers:  "I wish quests were like Morrowind where you had to figure out where to go without objective markers!"
---
Also Gamers:  "Where is the objective marker this is too hard I better ask the internet for help!"
---
...please don't tell me that you have to complete this event to move further into the quest...
---
Eh, if they weren't random spawn plans, I'd agree. But there already is a cap limit, why add this? I'd be curious as to what percentage of players even have the plans at this point.
---
that outfit looks straight out of naruto
---
It's something you'll get access to towards the end of the main quests :P
---
They just added a raider pa skin and a responder excavator is coming, so yeah.
---
That I will agree on! 
---
Keep them coming!
---
&gt; And now another nerf with the top hats.
---
Did you honestly expect this transaction to not get nerfed while YouTube has tons of videos explaining how to exploit it, where to farm the relevant plans and such?
---
Be glad you got to cap up while you could
---
Yea that was ... different ...
---
And ofc someone stole my bag after dying ...
---
Overall, good things—like where this patch is headed. Keep up the good work
---
The continuous pylon damage is what really ruined it. From the second I spawn in until the second I die my health constantly depletes.
---
Just failed it. It's not part of the quest, is it? I just saw it pop up and decided to try it out
---
Yes.  All the vendors everywhere do now, I believe.  One common vendor pool game wide.
---
Ok, what is an ASS rifle? Does it have anything to do with Taco Bell?
---
Looks like it... Quest completed and it let me to starting the Event
---
Fuck I need to start grinding challenges
---
Is this event part of the new quest or is it separate?
---
New event I believe
---
Plus one for those beehives and more razor grain skins.
---
Ohhhh my God lol NOOOOOPE
---
Yeah its the last quest.
---
That’s what I’m seeing as well. On Xbox
---
Thank you, any word on the community concerns regarding non cosmetic items breaking the promise to keep it cosmetic only?
---
Yup, you met yourself a griefer. I can't wait for them to implement Pacifist Mode for CAMPS as well, i was hoping this update would do it, hut no dice. Hopefully the next one does it.
---
With some restraint, you can self limit your area of play to an area with more people in it. 
---
See how that works? You want Bethesda to change the game to suit the way you want to play, but tell others to change they they play instead.
---
Such a shame
---
Only time I remember a rad storm was at charleston train station server hopping for the vendor and there might been 1 or 2 more times before that maybe. Yeah, leveling 3 times drunk was bad, wish there was some complaints about this, but people are focusing on those repair ktis and not noticing that Bethesda trying to make free atoms impossible to gain slowly until its be lucky to get 100 atoms a week.
---
You need to activate all 3 pylons to remove his shield
---
Are you on now?
---
You have to activate all 3 pylons to make it vulnerable and then sh*t on it with tse weapons. How I did it 🤣
---
That tea pot event in the forest
---
...do you have to win the event in order to finish the quest??
---
Gotta siphon those caps for that high level content somehow.
---
just finished it, i think there was around 10 players doing it alot of high levels lol everyone in power armor but i died once and had to revive alot of others, got a cool fedora. Its really fun
---
Fix the bigs for survuval challenges for me its the discover the abonded bog town or whatever
---
&gt; Repairing items now requires you to inspect them
---
...why? That's incredibly weird.
---
Reddit tough guy, eh? Go bother someone you can actually intimidate, like... well, no one really.
---
I did it at first i was confused but got the hang of it quick we beat it. Turns out the instructions were on a terminal lol
---
It seemed the opposite for me. I would start by finding one or none then it would slowly start increasing until it hit a peak. After that peak it would drop rapidly and I’d have to start a new session.
---
Died 32 times in 10 mins would just die. What the hell.
---
Yeah we did the pylons, where is the sheep though? All we saw were gutsy sand. Eyebots?
---
Some spawn during the Tea Event
---
I don't get how it matters if we have a fridge or not. Once we take it out it'll still spoil far too fast.  Unless the fridge 'repairs' food somehow?  Or gives it 200+% durability so it takes longer?  Either way, it's spoiling way too fast in game.
---
&gt; why add this?
---
Cap inflation, because, it makes those with the plans much more influential in the in game economy and able to out compete people in trades for secondhand gear/legendaries.
---
no still 6pm just wanna get it. you can PM if you want
---
&gt; Unlootable goo piles seems to be a thing again
---
Were they ever not a thing? I've pretty consistently seen them.
---
That's all you had to say, man. I couldn't live on this earth thinking someone thought like that. I will say that I think your game, while very simplistic, sounds fun. Maybe for one flip still give em something though, since it seems it's worse to get one light than zero :P
---
Its a new event so you get a lot of people not knowing you need 3 people on the pylons to deal damage, get a lot of people just shooting at it for most of the time.
---
Not 100% sure. We were able to do it on my first attempt.
---
We completed it in my server.
---
It was... tricky, mostly because no one knew what was going on.
---
Death was... commonplace :D and with full perks and full vanguard/sentinel that assaultron thing still hit like a truck.
---
Still, we still took it down and I got a cool hat for it. Baaaa baaaaa.
---
Yeah players in triple digit levels were getting owned. The bomb bots are the worst! But far, far worse was that when my group completed it, I couldn't find where the corpse was and then got disconnected! SOOO frustrating! I used up so many resources and didn't even get a reward.
---
liberators are literally first lvl 1 enemies you encounter
---
They should.
---
What's going on with that one?
---
I'd imagine it to be like mountain dew voltage
---
Also, they are sharing a cap pool of 200. Not 1400. I sold to one single vendor and it wiped out everyone.
---
Oh, well that's cool. Happy to at least hear that someone was able to complete it! And we thought the SBQ was hard...
---
Too bad the player that named it is the only one that can see it. Me and a buddy had a couple of good ones. An electrified Mr. Handy buzzsaw is my 'Electric can opener'.
---
1 faction is Whitesprings which is every vendor already there from previously!
---
It would be nice to get songs from older fallouts back to tbh. Basically I just want Johnny Guitar and Big Iron back.
---
But Zero is so much more heart crushing. I guess I could
---
See if it does, and a person has chameleon armor, they could shoot you while not moving and not be shot in vats when moving, with significant damage reduction as well. It would end VATS builds as we know it in pvp.
---
My unarmed build will now wield a power fist named "Elbow Deep".
---
..griefers gotta grief. Once the CAMP damage is taken away, I'm wondering what the idiots will do with themselves... I bet we see an uptick in workshop conflict.
---
I just accepted. Feel free to ft to me.
---
Is the sheepsqauatch outfit part of a quest?
---
I still think it's stupid having any kind of scaling caps loss in survival, but perhaps this was a quick and dirty fix to get more people in while they work on a real solution, like a set amount of kills earn caps per day/week, and that's it, dying loses you a FLAT amount of caps, say, 50, or maybe even not have it be a zero-sum game.
---
I'm pleased in general about most or all of this. Still hoping for some survival work. It's still in beta, so I have hope. Leaderboard a needed change.
---
I wonder if scorched ants counts. I always have a bunch attack me when I nuke site prime.
---
Oh glad it's not just me. Last few days I been thinking to myself, how come I don't see Radstorms anymore. I've seen 6-8 in almost 200hours. But still very little. Most of them I saw when the game first launched!
---
New boss battle. Sick loot
---
I’m doing that now to see thank you
---
Use the brain 😏
---
You still want it? My games updated lol
---
Yes and in case you find a storm you have to be lucky it is positioned where a glowing one spawns
---
I would love to have this. I am currently running full forest scout armor and under armor. Looks awesome but really needs some legendary love.
---
Hell I'm not even on psn and I could answer that. FO76 is an  online game. Therefore you need your system's online capabilities.
---
There's 7 faction vendors. You're already in Whitesprings. They did not add Enclave because you're also already there. that leaves?
---
if you server hop 10-15 times at a random spawn point (my go-to is the one on the road north of Fort Venture), you should find an animal that can be tamed. Just be prepared for your tamed animal to die. Where my camp is, I haven't had one last for more than a day. RIP Danny the Deathclaw, Babbitty Rabbit, and Gaston. (the others were owned by my gf, where they lived a few days)
---
An assaultron head laser skin? Is that weapon still glitched?
---
Probably as a way to inspect or repair. When I went to repair some armor, it had the option to "Inspect/Repair." I just looked for the repair option after that button but I'm sure rename was there.
---
Are you sure that the point of survival mode isn't to survive? I would love to see a citation from a Bethesda dev saying the point of the mode is to kill, because otherwise the notion is just an opinion.
---
Yeah its ridiculous how rare they are
---
Expect I haven’t gotten the boss battle? I got to the trap location and nothing. Nothing happens. What do I do? And what’s even the story? I’m confused? Was he just doing it for fame or something? Whats with the guy killing people?
---
Confirmed, legendaries respawn, random *level though, so a 3 star the first run can be a 1 star the next. If you get a well stocked server you can be swimming in  1star Wood armor in an hour.
---
Damn. I’m ready to get home and plaaaaaay!
---
They're supposed to all share 1400 not 200
---
I had 7 players decked out in power armor take him down in the last minute. I cant imagine how bad the FPS gets on console during the exploding. My PC struggled a bit, but it was manageable. Lots of fun though, enjoyed the questline.
---
Horseshit.. already died like 13 times im lvl 78 and crashed twice already -_-
---
My game is extremely laggy
---
The antique shop by Ft. Defiance usually spawns a few.
---
Here as well but it is inconsistent but I use this place to get me thru the challenge, sometimes I hop a few times, sometimes I have to hop 15, but the last one I had 5 attack me twice for both my characters, so worked like a charm for me but with any server hopping can be frustrating when they don't show
---
[https://youtu.be/Q7M58K-3CkM](https://youtu.be/Q7M58K-3CkM)
---
I'm also gonna name my all rise the "Rocket Dildo"
---
same. this was the thing i was looking forward to most this patch and now it seems not to be the case. they also nerfed civil war hat selling. bethesda seems hell bent on getting me not to play this game anymore.
---
Agreed. This kind of crap diminishes the value of caps.
---
Oh so we can just sell to one vendor to finish all our caps selling.
---
The sheepsquatch plush yeeeesssss
---
argh! I hate being on the afternoon shift right after an update! I can't play and I need to be careful what I read in the sub. Thanks, btw, for not spoiling anything :)
---
You must construct additional pylons!
---
An opinion? Anyone that is not on your team is an enemy. What does PVP mean? You're either really slow or flat dead retarded.
---
Ah ok. In the five minutes I’ve been able to play I tried renaming from inventory but it didn’t occur to me that you could rename from the benches too.
---
Xbox
---
 The point of Survival isn't PvP. The point was to introduce tension to player interactions to create a real "life post apocalypse" feeling when you ran into strangers.
---
That was what they tried to do originally in Adventure, but with a system in place to try to prevent griefing. 
---
While many of your ideas are well thought out and explained, it misses the point.  Survival isn't set up to reward player killing, it's to make player interactions costly if they go wrong. It's meant to make raider an actual playable character type.
---
Also, what's to keep me and a couple of friends from camping off in a corner and farming ourselves for commendations for a few hours?
---
i am currently online!
---
item naming, vendor pool, no-friendly VATS, A NEW QUEST LINE.
---
Dare nothing, this is absolutely the best patch to date.
---
Yes. But they aren't sharing a pool of 1400. They're sharing a pool of 200. Because it's Bethesda and we can't have nice things.
---
Hahaha yes that makes more sense 😂
---
Server disconnection. Obviously this is normal Bethesda and I have never lost any progress or anything just a rollback sometimes. Oh and also in my camp location there’s inflatable tubes, 2 of which are stacked in a way if you jump into them you’ll get stuck and one is always in the way of me building
---
Is the loot all cosmetic?
---
After dying countless of times during the new quest "[Kill a legendary Assaultron](/spoiler)" my game crashed. I have no quest in my journal that says anything about this quest. Is this a repeatable event or a one-time quest?
---
Karma or reputation could be used to measure whether you should trust a player or not, unturned did this in a way that if you saved/avenged (can't remember) a player, you gained karma, if you killed a player you lost karma, you could just make this appear under someone's name, along with (hopefully) a faction name
---
The antique shop not far from Watoga as well. If I'm hunting ants I usually hit up the Tea Time event, go outside the Lucky Hole mine, then fast travel to Appalachian Antiques. If nothing, server hop.
---
What?   What do you mean,  how much are they paying for the top hat now?
---
Cooler Atom items in general is the way to go. More unique outfits. More character customisation options, especially tattoos. Maybe add some jewellery, bitches love jewellery :P. But overall if they add more there, then people will buy them. Problem is a lot of items you can live without; they need to bring that big badd loot you cannot!
---
oh wow yay
---
But they can't shoot you with their weapon holstered and/or unequipped.
---
Then of course if they are invisible due to chameleon they really shoudn't be VATS targetable anyway, and the complaint is more about chameleon than a possible untargetable non-hostile person.
---
I feel sorry for people who listened to the negative hype and passed on playing this game. It’s so much fun...and just keeps getting better and better all the time.
---
This would get all of my Atoms!
---
"an dumbass" I think I just met one too lol
---
You initiate it on the computer. I wouldn’t suggest unless you have a solid strong team. Not for low levels with no legendary weapons
---
Only the triple level and rad storm is really hard.
---
The continuous pylon damage is intentional, it's explained in a note on a nearby terminal.
---
Come on dude
---
I tried and it wouldn’t let me 🤷‍♂️ whatever
---
lot of people prefer the reddit version, also some people cant access the beth site on their work network
---
Levelling up 3 times took little time with a new character for me. You do,the levelling up with responder gear,group and naked with the 2 quests in flatwood. Survival is even faster.
---
Aha, so that was it; now I know why my Grognak breaks so damn fast.
---
I believe so.  Which is what I'm hoping for when I get out of work and sell my 1400 caps for the day.
---
Where is camp decorating?
---
Yep, it seems like a decent chance at ant farming, thanks for sharing !
---
I've never seen so many downed players needing reviving
---
Shoot me your Bethesda username in a pm. You can jump on my server.
---
With the marine tactical that is 150 rubber a day, how are you farming that much rubber?
---
Sick loot meaning 1-star trash...
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Well, I have zero at the moment. It’s possible that you have to wait until your daily reset happens and you didn’t get one of the vendors yesterday.
---
Im aware that it is intentional. However making a playet die over and over again is a horrible mechanic to a boss fight.
---
It wasn't at all suspicious to see 20 civil war top hats in every vendors inventory.
---
They are rewards form the new quests.
---
It also helps keep from accidently selling gear your unsure of cause I run a bloodied weapon but not build so I switch between armor power armor and nudity depending on the fun I’m trying to have. So accidently selling something and not being able to buy it back for the same amount helps a lot.
---
Sounds like you used 1000 last night and 200 was all that was left.
---
I have to put myself in an invite only party while playing since I don’t think the other people around me want to be listening to cowbelly
---
Look at Mr. "I Have Friends" over here.
---
I guess with ability to sell everything to 1 vendor this makes sense, can you imagine being the next guy after 2 or 3 people have sold 42 top hats each.
---
 Scrolling for days to get past them.
---
YAY MATH!
---
pic?
---
:0
---
Then push the tab on the calendar
---
fingers crossed that it comes out with the rest of the display update they showed in the roadmap
---
Assault Rifles break down to steel and rubber.
---
No but it’s rare. So far I’ve seen a sheepsquatch helmet, outfit, and a new white fedora
---
Really!? I just finally got that plan **yesterday**!
---
Still have issues with dying in PA while overweight and not having a respawn available
---
Multiple times when server jumping WR armor does not register and.you log in at 350 when you left the last server at 245 and are now overweight... Reequipping did not fix it
---
Still seems like multiple Daily quests are locked and not offered
---
Usually only see visit the pumpkin, teapot, maybe 1 for camden park, ecological disaster, havent had any for the east side of the map since Dec/Jan...
---
I only got 200 caps for the vendor loot pool instead of 1400.
---
I sold 191 caps worth of junk in Watoga Station then headed to the BoS vendor who also only had 9 caps. So I went to the Whitespring and All Vendors (Faction and Whitespring) and ALL the vendors had 9 caps.
---
one of the atom store tracksuits had the option to use casual underarmor mods on it, so high chance that you can
---
I am hoping it's just a "first day vendors weren't empty and resetting" issue.  I had emptied all mine last night and will have to see what I get today.
---
I have zero problem with nerfs as long as they tell us.
---
I've found a bunch of cap stashes inside of the Penitentiary near Morgantown. Not sure if it's a consistent spawn, but they were in the office area just past the main entrance.
---
How do I buy a card? Am I blind?
---
I tried to do my own datamining use bae but that's the limit on my skills. I found an swf file but didn't try to install a Photoshop plugin to convert it. Figured Reddit would come through and did!
---
Exactly the samme. PS4
---
Sorting seems to have 'changed' for a few things, it might just be a bug, or someone's idea of an improvement.
---
Not in game, so I can't see what all may have changed, but any place you can't sort items yourself (vendors for instance) might be changed.
---
It’s on the note
---
Wheres this dog?pls help im terrible at those mistery thing?
---
What was the status of your vendor caps yesterday?  Did you clear them all out at the same time?
---
Same. It’s fun, but oh is it brutal.
---
If only you could rename aid items. Lol
---
Pop a cold one with bois 😂
---
I hit a few this morning pre patch but always save the bunker and ws station till after noon and now post patch all my vendors are showing zero Caps , weird !!!
---
I imagine they didn’t put the enclave in there because you have to unlock them through a quest but yeah, your math checks out.
---
Yeah I sold to whitespring vendor and the faction vendors had 0 caps so I guess the 1400 is shared minus enclave, I just thought they increased the caps for each faction to 1400.
---
Is the Bone Raider skin limited to a particular PA armor?
---
Totally agree!
---
People reported Grahm having it, as well as the vendors in Whitespring.  Seems the vendors carry them now (about 2000 caps).
---
I just finished them all. Got one from each. I don’t know if it’s repeatable.
---
I WILL ALSO ADD TO THE EXCITEMENT!!!  ALL CAPS!!!  WEEEEE!!!!!  Now my last hour at work is going to seem like an eternity.  Must...Create.... Lovely room of death....
---
Holy fuck thank you
---
Did you have all 1400 caps available at the one vendor?
---
The main counter to chameleon and sentinel right now is shooting people when they reposition or using Tesla guns, or Vats Crits. If you can’t Vats target when they move, it makes Vats obsolete and only strengthens the sentinel meta.
---
A set of Weightless Sentinel is unstoppable by this logic.
---
Hold on new quest holy crap I gotta get back on fallout
---
Feel like rad storm is impossible unless you know guaranteed glowing creature and server hop until you get one. Since the storm can last for few minutes which gives time to kill the creature/server hop.
---
Same, m'self.
---
I sold 191 caps worth to the Watoga vendor now all vendors have only 9 caps left. I _hope_ that'll reset tonight/tomorrow but if not that's uh, quite the disappointment.
---
Vendors sell them for around 2000 caps
---
All of the whitesprings vendors have em
---
Yeah, some update a month or two back fixed them. I haven't seen them since
---
How do you do this, exactly? I've been messing around and can't seem to figure out how to name the actual chassis.
---
Its the new sbq. Get your trouble shooter weapons ready.
---
Push the laundry day. The others are duds.
---
Laggier than Scorched earth
---
You're also right at a secret entrance with the production vendor 100 yards away
---
I'm not even sure I know how to do this so probably everyone I've encountered has heard me talking to myself all night.
---
Pretty much. If someone just blatantly lies (in that it wasn't out of their control or something else that excuses it) yeah, I won't believe what they say anymore.
---
So far I’ve only seen regular weapon vendors have it
---
Perhaps
---
I have a Level 50 Vanguard’s Shadowed Metal Left Leg, Sentinel, AP Refresh. Don’t have a picture but I can send when I get home.
---
I put no points into CHA and its 2400 caps for me rip, as a new player I have plenty of other things to do while I grind out the caps.
---
lmao
---
yep this is whats happening with me.
---
Haven't done the event or anything with the dlc from it but does everyone take damage? Sounds like all you need is a tank to activate the pylons and soak the damage then the bloodied builds can get to work?
---
Basement
---
Be cool to have security robots for camps that can fight back.

&gt; Exploits: Addressed an exploit that could allow players to repeatedly farm Stimpak rewards granted after completing the Mayor for the Day quest.
---
I had assumed that meant getting 8 stimpacks a day just by visiting the safe, since it stopped happening after that patch. Though, in all fairness, I would have categorized it as a glitch rather than an exploit
---
Hell yeah. I might need to plug my ps4 back in and update this
---
Watoga = Free states
---
We're all chaos space marines now.
---
I found out about the mothman egg method, got patched right after. Finally found out about the civil war top hat method, it got patched right after 😂 back to grinding for chems and crap legendaries at whitesprings I suppose
---
sold nothing yesterday so they should all be full of caps today. starting selling to one vendor and got down to like 5 caps. now all vendors everywhere only have 5 caps.
---
Also, pics?  I need to live vicariously through you for the next 60 minutes
---
NICCCCCCCCEEEEEE.
---
I’ve had this happen randomly on Xbox with the cans the robots come out of in Watoga. Seems to fix itself on a game restart. It hangs around even after just a relog.

I think this stuff made more sense in FO4 with the manufacturing expansion. With the limited building stuff in 76, there isn’t much use.
---
PA tank gang💪
---
Ughhhhhhh. 
---
Thanks :)
---
&gt; I think having to take MANDATORY damage is fucking stupid. But there you have it....
---
Well, I guess there has to be some downside to running a low health build.
---
Sorry, english inst my original language
---
Your little vagina is quivering don’t lie psn touchmybumm add me if you want a challenge I will come for you ... and I will steal your non existent caps and your purified water
---
For sure! :)
---
Some of them are still broken even with a fresh char.
---
It is a good road, thanks !
---
You need new friends.
---
It might come in handy in Silo+SBQ or Burrows runs, since you could reduce your active weapon load by quite a bit (won't need a backup weapon to your Two-Shot/Bloodied Explosive Whatever if you can take 20s to fix it back up), but those are also the places where you'll be able to pick up the higher-quality repair kits, which give you 50% more durability than the Atom Store ones.
---
Everyone is doing it at the same time, seems things are not progressing for some. I did the other quests then came back to the main and it continued for me.
---
How do you build vending machine in your camp?
---
Havent played new stuff yet, but you said it "zaps"? So would grounded mutation help the damage that you take?
---
Balls, OK.
---
Enough with the cancer fortnite looking outfits and masks lmao. 
---
The raider power armor is finally a step in the right direction, but I’m so sick of these cringey animal masks.
---
my experience starting a new character in survival was basically just getting murdered every 5 minutes.  100% they dropped it there because people were refusing to play it completely.
---
From the patch notes:
---
&gt; Item Assignment Icons: When viewed in the Stash or transfer menus, items that have been assigned to an object now display icons next to their names indicating where they have been assigned.
---
&gt; Dev Note: For the moment, these icons will only appear on items assigned to the Fermenter. In future updates, we plan to implement more of these types of icons for other new features, such as player vending and display cases.
---
Compare your Fallout76.ini to your custom.ini and add anything missing from the archive2list.
---
From those images, looks interesting. Curious to see more. Lol
---
Found out it happens when I join a team?
---
Indubitably
---
Sheepsquatch Outfit, Tactical Ops Outfit, Easterbunny Mascot Mask, Skull Mask, Complete Barset, Beer Kegs and Colored Flooring all instant buys. Amazing!
---
Lmao I used to think tank builds (myself) were useless in this game because almost everything did no damage especially the scorch beast queen, bloodied builds could just pop fireproof on and smash the queen. But from all the things I've heard of the event I think i might actually be useful lol
---
Only the activator takes damage, but you keep continually taking it as long as the pylon is active, far as I can tell. AND there is a rather ridiculous time limit for the event as well. So, there's that too...
---
except most assault rifles will sell for like 80 caps plus. better to just sell the rifles.
---
Yesterday I took out a legendary snallygaster and all it gave was waste acid and a shitty piece of armor.
---
Well damn, there go my atom points
---
Gold and Silver Handmade Skins have already been datamined as future Atomic Shop items, just so you know 👍 set aside a few hundred caps pal, they're coming
---
People complaining that they can’t bring their 1 shot build into everything in the game.
---
Xbox, big guy. Don’t let your ego get you into trouble.
---
That event was bonkers. Dont run a bloodied build and I died a good 5-6 times from those damn explosions. Dense mod a must.
---
Can confirm this
---
Too many?? 😂 yeah I didn't even think to post about it.
---
That's like 5,000 hats.  Still 65,000c with the right perk/CHA.
---
Yup.
---
Done this event, nothing triggers afterwards? Is that bugged or is that all we get?
---
I do have an assaultron card but see no way to use it
---
Fps bottomed out and the game crashed on my xbone. Lost my card :(
---
I can’t even mod my pa at the moment
---
??? 
---
Harpers ferry = free states
---
Absolutely. It also dis-incentivizes killing as the only pastime in Survival and encourages other types of play, which helps. I might actually try it now.
---
I did the quest but i cannot turn in t data,nothing happens when i stand in front of the red mailbox,anyone else got this?
---
Man I was excited to play the new stuff tomorrow. Don't scare me and tell me they are as shitty as the rest of the game
---
The main road to Flatwoods can never go wrong, can’t be nuked, new players, and high traffic for buisness
---
Ok. Like I said I haven't played it yet so just thought it might. Btw thanks for not spoiling it, not gonna read any more threads till I do.
---
You forgot to make something as "dumbfuck."
---
As I’m playing. It’s like extremely laggy. I’m gonna try and restart the game or if that doesn’t work, I’ll just restart the console,
---
I'm only partially okay with the kits so long as Bethesda doesn't start slowly decreasing the general weapon and armor durability in the whole game while upping their decay from damage or use. If they start trying to incentivize buying the repair kits for "convenience" in order to deal with a situation they created then I can't really support them at all after that.
---
Yeah, I'm still getting the longest life stat board. It might become active after the next day cycle, that's my only guess.
---
No additional speed anymore and no faster reload either. It broke on the last update.
---
From the description in the patch notes, it sounds like it'll cost both: item must be in your Stash, and then you'll put down a Display Case &amp; choose which item to display. Hopefully the camp budget is pretty small.
---
Ok yeah that's what I would do, I usually gave a lot of lag problems while just spawning
---
I’m guessing bos = super duper mart (Phoenix)
---
Shopping mall = watoga train station/graham?

So with you. I'm avoiding spoilers at all cost.

 This post got me so hyped!

Maybe log out and back in

Now they need to add jet pack to raider armor, unless it’s there and just a unicorn.
---
You must find the clues

Liberator mark 0. Mark 5s are higher level.

---
Really? You can do this now??
---
The mechanics seem pretty self-explanatory.  The Assaultron is just ridiculously powerful.
---
Basically three people need to activate a pylon to make the Assaultron vulnerable to attacks.  Alternatively, one person can activate all the pylons.  Once you become a conduit, you will begin to take damage over time.
---
I played it twice.  The first time with multiple random people who did not comprehend the objective.  The second time with one other person.
---
I just hope the rewards are worth it because this event is a bitch and makes the Scorchbeast Queen look easy.
---
Of course there are still optimal ways to make money, I'm pointing out that this "exploit" is over
---
Blueberry super acidic soda
---
I ran into Insult Bot once.  I got a thing in my inventory that said "you have been insulted!" and that was it.  I shot the bot for wasting my time and got a steel scrap for my trouble.
---
cool, I'll take a look
---
I straight jizzed my pants when I saw the power armor skins coming out.  Bethesda has my wallet by the short-curlies as I don't think I can complete enough challenges to buy two power armor skins, let alone three.
---
Same but also on other useless stuff
---
Same thing here
---
Just got a lot of cloth at once. It had to be changed but i just got lucky. Kinda lucky...it's a lot of button pushing
---
There are loads of guaranteed glowing creatures rad storm is hard
---
Looks Michael Jackson-ish.
---
They give new rewards for competing them.
---
I'm hopping on now, so I'll check it out. My main concern was.. do I still have to go to watoga for power armor plans, or the amusement park for excavator stuff, or find Graham for the rare chance to find his stuff?
---
u/ladydevann
---
I had to server hop, it’s kinda like the fasnact event
---
That’s what happens when idiots go on forums and YouTube and brag about selling endless amounts of stuff. LoL 
---
Whenever I find a decent way to farm something or make extra caps I don’t tell anyone shit lol
---
Is the skin for Power Armor for the excavator Armor? I thought it would be for raider armor...
---
Might purchase that skin just for a replacement for the helmet.
---
From a post under PerkLoadoutManager:  
---
&gt; To update IF USING OTHER MODS THAT USED sResourceArchive2List: Copy your mod list and completely delete the sResourceArchive2List line from Fallout76Custom.ini. Add a new line to your Fallout76Custom.ini, starting with:  
---
&gt;**sResourceArchiveMisc** = SeventySix - MiscClient.ba2, PerkLoadoutManager.ba2 
---
That was from an update or two ago.
---
I'm fucking done with this bullshit, just killed the sheepsquatch which is a 3 star legendary, just to get a fucking 1 star wood chest peice. They really need to fix that shit.
---
I'm betting this is it. Really hoping.
---
Still no information for suspended players?
---
&gt;If it's not purely cosmetic then it's pay to win. Period
---
see, i find that sort of comment ridiculous.  
---
as for how it damages "public trust", that remains to be seen.  i honestly can't recall the fiascos you mentioned, but i haven't lost any trust in corporations because i never had any.  honestly cannot muster even a meh over this, but hey, it's probably cause I'm getting older.  and don't play many multi player games.
---
my experience with this game is subjective: i feel the issues at launch were overblown.  it could be cause i play it like an advanced version of minecraft.  but buggy software releases and testing in production, because making the date is more important than QA, is not something that is exclusive to games.  hell, it's SOP for some systems. i've been in IT for 20yrs; the only stuff that isn't broken is the code that hasn't been touched in a decade or so.  what game hasn't had a rough launch in the past few years?
---
again, perspective is important here.  i don't know what $60 is to you.  for me, it's not a lot, and i understand i'm in a position of privilege in that respect. i also understand it's going to pay for maybe an hour of a dev's time.
---
They still can absolutely make a difference in a battle if something breaks, which means they are pay 2 win, which Bethesda said the atom shop would only be cosmetics, and nothing that effected gameplay.
---
LOL, You could buy 2 cloth for 1 cap on the trade forums and turn that into two hats worth 14+ caps each. If you had some strange moral compass you get all your own cloth from 1 quick Watogo HS run. Once you have had a taste of that I doubt people are going to start farming super mutants for rifles. Not sure if it is still viable but people will go back to afk water farming if it is.
---
No one cares
---
I've discovered the dam on 3 characters, no luck getting the challenge to admit that.
---
Yeah, the disadvantage is you can't get spotted or hit. You have to be very careful. But when FORCED to be hit by game mechanics, well...that kind of defeats the entire purpose of running a glass cannon. Hence my warning. If you are going to run Bloodied you are still very useful for killing the boss, but you will also need other people to take the hits. DON'T attempt it yourself or without people who can take a LOT of punishment with you. And the damage from the pylons is electrical. I'm not sure if there is a perk or counter for that at present.
---
They're specifically talking about people going to Adventure Mode to get a Bounty, and *then*  hopping over to Survival.
---
I Role play as a Vault Dweller who got out of the vault with his dad at age 16. He and his dad lived peacefully on a small farm until a group of raiders threatened their lives they gave him a scar across his eye and killed his dad. Cut to 3 years later. He became a lancer for the brotherhood. Before this he had joined numerous gangs watching them rise and fall, all to find who killed his dad. He had finally found his dads killers and slaughtered them brutally. After that he drifted for a long year until finding the brotherhood. By that time he was a grizzled veteran of the wasteland.
---
When you look at your friends list it doesn’t show everyone who’s online together, all the usernames are spread out, I got line 40+ ppl on my list so now I gotta cycle through everyone to find out who’s online lol garbage
---
The dead legendary spawn happens all the time in Watoga, a legendary spawn from a pot and drop dead right after, then its self destruct goes off and blow me off 1/3 of my health...
---
My friends camp killed me when he disconnected. I had 100 stimpaks and dropped 49 of those. Hell yeah, I'm glad they fixed this.
---
Check out the other side quests
---
Your heads inflated
---
Did somebody mention Atom Cats? https://imgur.com/a/VsXAye0 ;)
---
Every ghoul’s crazy ‘bout a sharp dressed man...
---
if it's just the mod, do you have adequate perks for the pa crafting? I realized that with my guns that I still needed the perks the apply the mod
---
That’s the end. You gotta buy a keycard from a vendor to initiate the final quest/event.
---
Read the patch notes again, a shared cap pool across all vendors in the game was also one of the changes.
---
Like your ego.
---
How do I start the side quests? I failed the event so can I do the side quests from there?
---
The problem with glowing is they could be replaced with different mob like scorch or super mutant depending on the area and if you server hop to get a rad storm and have to fast travel to another glowing creature spawn the storm might be over.
---
It's called "Raider Excavator Armor" in the data mine iirc
---
You have to read the poster at a railroad station.
---
Does that barset remind anyone else of Ace Attorney?
---
Nothing popped up saying I completed it though?
---
They’re in the taxidermy place. Look at the wall with the map and stuff. Press the notes.
---
Yeah, it was the whitespring vendor at the workbenches the original one not the faction one.
---
What kind of awards?
---
I think we all have our way of playing Fallout. So when PVP came out its kill it be killed. A real raider mentality went into it. I complained at first but I'm having fun now.
---
I dunno, myself and the ten or so people I did it with ran out of time. The time limit is BRUTAL.
---
Thanks for putting these lists together!  Question, are these lists "in addition to" lists 1-7 you linked above?  Or is it showing more of a progress thing like "We started at list 1, and are now at 8" kind of list?  Because if these are all the main big bugs that are current from the start of the game from list 1, I gotta say I'm even more impressed at how they've turned things around than I already was.
---
It’s a misc quest
---
Yeah it’s working now lol. I was spooked for a second
---
What is the anticipated ETA for player vending??
---
Is this related to the new Event: Cryptid?
---
Warrider can't wait!!!!
---
Finding the clues is optional.
---
It was a very hard event. I don't think I've died that much since first taking on the scortchbeast queen
---
My camp is a bar, so the bar items will be a great addition
---
Endangerol stacks with other players endangerol.  If everyone were to shoot sbq with it, the fight would be a lot easier.
---
”... Name comes across masculine though, so really don't think anyone thinks I'm actually a girl... Maybe.”
---
In the wasteland, you takes what you can gits, cutey pie.
---
Also when you look at notes in the vendors, it’s used to show all the “known” notes at the top, now that is also scrambled with notes you don’t know. 
---
Doesn’t even look to be in any kind of alphabetical order either lol garbage
---
I received a wolf head after completing the first new quest.
---
HELL YEAH A HARD EVENT
---
Last I heard ~1 month from today.
---
Yes jewellery! Why is the Wedding Ring the only bling in the whole game?
---
Yesssssssss! Finally!
---
Except my quest didn't complete till I found them ;P
---
I Hope so. I am out 1200 caps for the day now though :(
---
Can you [fill out a ticket for me](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10) and let me know the number?
---
And there's 43 of the mounted heads which, if this is true, means 43 NEW side quests, give or take.
---
*destruct* additional pylons :P
---
not sure what your on about, or what kinda joke is here. But this is a bug im bringing up, not the popularity I have. I suggest you conduct yourself appropriately to avoid looking like a bellend online.
---
Nope that's a special surprise bonus for all the vault dwellers.
---
&gt;For the weapons, I’m a rifle build, I carry a furious lever action with me and a TSE handmade, I don’t see how you can think it is pointless carry a extra weapon that you can be specced for
---
Because my character is heavy weapons build, every weapon weighs over 30lbs. nearly 100lbs in ammo, food, stimpacks, purified waters(or booze), etc.
---
Even in my Excavator PA I'm only about 45lbs below being over encumbered, without full set of excavator I'm over 50lbs above being over encumbered. Not to mention my stash is already completely full of stuff so I can't even make more room to not have to worry about a single piece of excavator PA breaking which would send me right to over encumbered. Meaning no sprinting, no fast traveling, etc. So yes these repair kits absolutely would be P2W for anyone built like my build (which  took from the most popular build on the fo76 builds website) so for the majority of players these repair kits absolutely give them an advantage over someone who doesn't spend real money.
---
Same here. I was only in there a few minutes and I was already top ten.
---
I play through the display on my Mazda 3
---
Holo tape on diner table
---
Lol dude have you been playing the event it’s riddled with bugs as is the rest of the game. Small things that can easily be fixed. Don’t spout off to me about balance there’s nothing balancing about making it go from 1 material which I agree is too little should just take like 2 or three cloth. The bug fixes they mentioned were things that should have been fixed a while ago. They only “nerfed” it because of the robot vendors of which honestly no one wants or needs more glitchy robots populating the world though the one stop shop aspect is awesome just shouldn’t have been robots. Maybe terminals like modus?
---
Now imagine a mirror rug made out of Raider skin
---
You also forgot to mention the cost of mats to make now.
---
Your the best thanks
---
Yeah. I am debating just not playing this game anymore. I can't be arsed to grind for an hour each day just for things to sell to the vendor.
---
People over here like, new mounted heads, and I’m like, why the hell is there a gorilla head.
---
Oh hell yeah... Thanks all for the info!!
---
Oh no they fixed an exploit
---
Seriously?
---
1400 caps. A day.
---
Maybe they should nerf player vending, too!
---
I mean, the price gauging is going to make some people much more influential in tje game economy.
---
And there won't even be a cap limit! :gasp:
---
Coming back to this, I just had a fight on my level 25 with a level 98.  
---
I was in power armor, about 75% health, he was at about 10% health with no armor. Missed my first shot from a shotty and was instantly downed. Now, this time I only lost 7 caps so I assume some sort of balance has been implemented, but that's what I was getting at.
---
No problem.. it took me a while to figure out what was causing it. I'm just surprised the issue has gone on this long
---
3 cloth and 1 leather for 50c item :(
---
Just finished it right before leaving for work. My brother got the T-45 Jetpack plan and I got a hat :^)
---
I’m hoping it’s a daily or even weekly item required for the dungeon entry.  Caps are starting to get out of control and I feel need a good cap sink.  On the market place you have multiple guns going for 50k caps.
---
It looks like they alphabetized based on the original name without the (Known) tag. I preferred all the known ones lumped together so I could skip through them easily.
---
The stupid looking masks shoudn't be in a fallout game, they are fortnite shit for kids.
---
Yeah, it was difficult even with many players but we took it down. Died multiple times, just respawn and try again.
---
Totally! Like I said, I hate to be seen as someone who will only fight with the odds in my favor, but in this case I don't care because the ends just don't justify the means most of the time with the Queen fight anymore. I really feel for the try hards and lower levels who need the big gun guys and lethal level builds to make it happen for them.  You usually know who they are and can see them trying to help as best they can, but you know in your heart it's not gonna be this time 'cause there's not enough of us and everybody else is just running about, jacking around.  Hope you have better encounters in the future.
---
Making an alt doesn't give you access to more atoms, the atom rewards are account based, not character based. So even if you make a new character, they won't be able to get more atoms from challenges you already completed on another character on that account.
---
Possible Workshop contending?
---
I mean, they were still pretty damn near impossible to find.
---
Apparently people think it somehow allowed an endless amount of cap flow. Psh, no.
---
So your parents never told you santa, easter bunny or tooth fairy?
---
Only got one each of the 5 quests, got one form the repeatable boss battle at the end of the main quest. I’m assuming that’s how you get the rest.
---
#stopthedeathclawabuse.
---
 did you happen to find any new quest lined like how to find the nuka armor paint jobs?
---
Seriously? Haven’t crafted any today, so i didn’t check this. Have like 400 stored on a mule for the caps every day.
---
You don’t know anything about me lol. Why are you pretending to know me? Definition of a hater
---
Mounted head plans.
---
An exploit that made the game half way bearable.
---
I just wish people would stop running from me when I'm trying to give them blueprints... lol
---
Psn touchmybumm I will take your non existent caps and then touch your bum
---
I do run around with summer shorts on with pipe pistols. As unassuming as it gets. Few pops in Vats though and people drop. Also shes a cannibal. Really saves never dealing with food decay. I call her the Man Eater.
---
Accidentally hit someone when fighting SBQ?
---
We need them to be worth 466c so we can sell 3 a day. How much charisma do you need to make them worth about 460c with hard barter 3?
---
Its improved so much. You definitely should.
---
One of the new side quests has you search a lake near Site Alpha I think it was, when I fast traveled there I was greeted with a rad storm &amp; a high level glowing yao guai. Might be same for everyone. I think the quest was 'tracking Terror'.
---
Spoiler alert
---
nah
---
Good bye then....already missing you so much
---
Lol! That would prolly need to be a team event like the SBQ fight.  Crickets are one of the hardest hitting critters now anyway.  Right up there will the yogis.
---
Inflatable tubes??
---
\*Tips hat\* M'squatch
---
Did you get th fixer at level 30?
---
Hope so, 01 Excavator may not sound exciting but having it always at the top of the list will he a god send.
---
That will get you 4000 caps now.  At least they're made so you don't have to spend more on materials
---
you can yet. they delayed that for a least another month.
---
It's fucking hardm hey. What level "the fixer" did you get?
---
Did you complete the event. I just tried with a bunch of people and no one could for the life of the. Figure out how to activate pylons. Not sure if there are more quests after that as we failed the event
---
If you were relying on grinding out hats to keep up with this game, you're really bad at it.
---
Yeah, I have it. Someone reminded me that the last part is a misc quest, and now I just have to start the event, so I'm all set haha
---
&gt; It dropped Calibrated shocks as well
---
For which PA?  Excavator?
---
Oh. I didn’t know that.
---
The perk card for PA mods is Power Smith, right? I definitely had that fully upgraded and equipped, and Armorer too for good measure.
---
But they won’t sadly.
---
Bring stimpack!!!!!!!!!
---
I want them to add Scorchbeast themed items like camp stuff, an icon, or maybe a skin or something. They’re my favorite creature
---
Yeah I’m stuck too. It says they are optional but I’m at the grinder place stuck on 2/3 after downloading the coordinates.
---
Yea it's a slight bit confusing and the quest seems to just end there, I'm a bit disappointed with the conclusion but I'm hoping I am just wrong or the game is bugged for me. Not sure why the quest just ends there
---
I think they should add more durability to camps.
---
What is the change? Can you only sell one?
---
Do the new sidd quests
---
i just finished the event, had like 5 3\* legendary drops there.. and some rly cool outfits
---
Even server hopping is just random. How do you know where a storm will be?
---
This is almost impossible unless nuke zone count. But obviously today nobody do nukes 'cause we don't have the codes.
---
It has nothing to do with build.  Mandatory damage in ANY context is a mark of poor design.
---
Being able to sell those, even at their current post-patch material cost, for 35-40 caps a pop was incredibly overpowered. It **is** a matter of balance. 3 cloth and 1 leather for about 10 caps as it is right now is pretty fair.
---
The bug fixes, whether or not they should have been fixed a while ago, are still bug fixes and evidence that they are trying to fix it which is what you're saying they're not doing.
---
I know but they could have gotten me like 12k caps. Reducing the value by 66% plus increasing the materials to craft is ridiculous. I mean it’s not gamebreaking but still annoying.
---
Sometimes I don’t like the look of the camp, so I do some remodeling.
---
Sometimes I just knock the door down then have a nap in the bed.
---
Sometimes I’m trying to incite a response.
---
Oh, yeah. Nobody knew what they were getting in to. Everybody died many times over. I'm sure people will adapt, but it's going to take some doing. Also, I have NO idea how to trigger the event again.
---
Still haven't played the update, can someone explain me?
---
I think it's easier. I tanked the pylons with super stims and did some good damage on it. The rest of the group was good damage too so went down fast. A lot of low levels died though, useless but was fun.
---
The thing they didn't include in the patch notes, the civil war top hat is now worth 50 caps (down from 150)!
---
You walk up to them and activate (with whatever button that is for you) and you need to stand near it, if I'm correct you also take some damage over time too. It's hard to say due to the lag and bugs I faced when I did this
---
Thank you kindly!
---
Did it drop at level 30?
---
They broke the Gatling Plasma now it spins up and shoots a single shot... -.-
---
This was a pretty disappointing event. I personally can’t go 2 seconds without dieing and becoming the conduit is a 5 second affair. Aside from the fact that the quest seems to just end there and I personally didn’t see a real sheepsquach.
---
I got a sheepsquatch outfit looks super cool
---
For those who are grateful the cap theft for dying g I survival being dropped from 200% to 25% need to keep something in mind. There are raiders out there who are going to move back to adventure mode where the cap theft is still 100% of the player's level and go back to workshop farming for pvp and caps. Already seen a few raider groups post that new plan, so you have been warned. If you value your caps, don't take workshops or we'll be coming...
---
Yeah. I'm level 129 so not sure why it didn't drop at 50
---
What about Lazer rifles and armor negate
---
We activated the pylons and were swiftly defeated. I think there were too many people around, increasing the difficulty. Legendary Mr handys exploding all over the place. Mission failed and vanished.
---
Ouch insulted because he thought you weren't good enuff to even be insulted lolol poor you 🤣
---
Tried it twice, one client crash and one event fail. I wasted tons of stimpacks and died who-knows how many times.
---
From the quest? :o post a pic
---
The person above you is completely right, though. They use Amazons cloud servers, them slowing down now out of nowhere is due to fewer servers being available. Remember about a month ago when everyone was complaining about being the only people on the server and having it to themselves? Yeah, that was right before the server numbers got cut.  
---
This game is hemorrhaging players and seems to be failing every step of the way. At this point I just come here to watch this trainwreck up close out of some morbid curiosity. I figure they owe me that much after charging me triple A prices for this "game".
---
not sure why they are so intent on limiting cap gains in this game ... its not like you even spend it on shit ...nothing to buy in game lol ....im sitting on 3 toons with 25k each....
---
Yeah. This one is ridiculous.
---
That message appears at times.  Sometimes if you build a set of stairs on a nearby foundation you can then move/scrap the wall and place it where you want.
---
I don't believe it's related to this particular patch.  It's an ongoing issue that pops up when you are building in your CAMP, has been for a while.
---
After playing a little more I realize I was far too nice with these comments. You've got to be pretty slow for this to be a problem anywhere. I thought not having problems on a lvl 8 was evidence, but my level 4 with no armor and no weapons has no trouble... so it's practically unimaginable to have this much trouble and it not be squarely your fault. Or in other words how dumb do you have to be to not shoot the stuff that you know the spawn location and time of *AND THEN* blame it on others and have no sense of personal responsibility. I mean why should you pay a modicum of attention when other people could just use shit weapons and double the time you have to meander to the church and shoot in the general direction of "the red thing."
---
New Feature: Vendor bots no longer tell you when you already know a plan.
---
My female character would love to rock some!
---
Any sign of the white sheep costume?
---
That just happened to me before it tanked.
---
Thank you anyway! It's the thought that counts right? :)
---
Energy has and always  will suck till they fix the armor negation
---
Fyi, the way the "added" the frat houses is this:
---
All those buildings already existed, but lacked distinguishing features or functional doors. They just looked like any other boarded up building in Fallout.
---
And then when they added the DLC, the just layered new decorations and functional doors over the old the exteriors (easy since the doors just teleport you to a separate game location for the indoor areas anyway).
---
In fact it's still possible to see the old versions sometimes if you load into the area but the added content doesn't load in right away, and then suddenly appears after another minute or so (sometimes there's a lag, or at least I had a bunch when it first launched, maybe that's fixed)
---
Yeah I was curious too. Oh well it looks cool.
---
I wish they added a quest line to make your scout armour legendary. Be a bit pointless and lose its charm if it just dropped off ghouls
---
You use the assault on key card you got just before that mission. Did you use yours or did someone else trigger the event? I know you can craft one but I've read its cost around 2000 caps for the circuit board
---
Oh I'm aware they spawn at my camp at least once a day. Id love to take an entire team like the SBQ to fight one little cricket.
---
Yes, that's the correct card.
---
BTW You're not alone... there's a few threads along the same lines where people can't apply mods to their X01 armor. I went back in and tried to mod my Excavator armor and didn't run into any problems personally, which I know isn't helpful. Just that it isn't consistent.
---
Similar issue. Got killed during the pylon event and got an infinite black loading screen so had to quit. Now have no quest in log.
---
The Whitespring flooring?  Been out for a while now.
---
Oh wow, I'm unfamiliar with mutation serums. That is awesome. I'd like to get some beneficial ones
---
Occasional spawns in Fort Defiance, also.
---
Sheepsqautch vs queen I’d pay to see that one !
---
It was easier and faster than queen on my server just now.
---
GOD BLESS THE VENDOR CHANGES
---
Lolz. What ever dude. Making hats for 1 cloth selling for 36 caps is obviously stupid when most legendaries sell for less than that. Just doing my vendor runs and seeing them all full of hats was ridiculous.
---
Welp, look like I'm gonna be buying some atoms...
---
Sorry Bank account :(
---
At Fissure site Prime?
---
It's like 15 instead of 28-38.  But they also cost considerably more to craft (3 cloth, 1 leather).
---
Hell yes just saw this, as a low-base-charisma player I'm hype.
---
Oh thank goodness!  I hope all the other Dailies (Queen of the Hunt, etc.) get the same treatment!
---
I killed most of them single handed with a combat knife. Stealth works great there. The explosions can be countered with dense chest and 1 perk level in fire. I think it's easier because as long as you have someone tanking the pylons, the squatch is pounded unlike the queen who can fly and has a lot more hp.
---
just a tiny thing: it's not a mod, it's a mode
---
Nope, Event was already over and I have passive mode enabled so I cannot attack others.
---
Maybe I can make my own fire breather group or something. Or my own minute men
---
Sight*
---
You will be marked for PVP anywhere on the map if his team mates are contesting the workshop
---
And I don’t know what you are talking about with “easy mode”. I want survival back with 200% caps so we have incentives to kill each other. I wanna actually have to work to survive in survival mode
---
Even those camera skins. That woodgrain is an immediate purchase for me...
---
Oh, that's great.  Everyone's favorite tedious  mechanic is back again.
---
Oh ok ! i'm not a native speaker, sorry :)
---
I got a 30 I think
---
Probably not, I have seen plenty of people pvp in survival mostly in or around the marked guys on the map but have have almost never seen anyone do normal pve things in survival. I am sure there are some die hards that only play in that game mode but I am sure most just go back to adventure to do things like vendor runs.
---
Quest items are usually significantly weaker than drops, because dev’s don’t want one of the better items/sets to be guaranteed for players by doing any particular activity. 
---
So if this is the case the set will be probably be outclassed by basically everything.
---
The 10 LVL 100+ we're dropping like flies. Nothing easy about our attempt. What were your quest rewards? I'm worried we won't get a chance to try again.
---
Can you confirm?
---
i found the note on the shelf then the computer..downloaded the co-ordinates and still says find traces of wolf 2/3(optional) where's the 3rd clue?
---
That's in the game?  Where can I find one?
---
I think the dailies need to be a lot more generic and flexible. They're getting so specific. Wear a beer hat in a rad storm while milking a brahmin and riding a unicorn and shooting an energy weapon with a critical headshot for 10 atoms.  Just make it things like kill 5 scorched, drink 5 alcohols, scrap items to get 5 springs, and such like.
---
Some people will find a way to screw with you no matter the game mechanics changes.  Many PvE’ers said they’d be rid of the griefers with Survival - that just moved PvPers, not the griefers.
---
Blowing up a camp is not griefing, though.  Repeatedly, sure, but once?  Nope.
---
Well, to me... challenges *shouldn't* be completable by everybody.
---
Not everyone gets trophy, man. There's no bragging rights to something everyone has.
---
Lvl 30 dont know why i couldnt get max lvl
---
Each list is new bugs, and I try to avoid repeating ones I have already posted unless I have new information on them. That said, there is still a lot of progress made on fixing bugs, because many of the things across my 8 lists have been fixed.
---
Ty!
---
Diabetes. I'm pretty sure on this.
---
Well, now it sucks 200x more
---
Well all they have to do is make it hard then with maybe a chance element involved just like legendary drops but some how tied with an enclave event
---
Correct me if I’m wrong, but there are Perk Cards that reduce the weight of everything for heavyweapons, junk, and aid. It sounds like you should do some more homework into your own build then just copy one from a builds website.  It also sounds like you are carry around way to much stuff on you. 
---
Just because you have your build a certain way that doesn’t sound to beneficial still doesn’t make repair kits P2W.  Also in no way do I think heavy weapons is the most popular build by any means. 
---
I understand we both see this very differently so I’m going to leave it at that. Anything I say on here isn’t going to convince you of something else nor you convince me of something else.
---
I'm at work so can't see for myself, but is it confirmed then that we can rename our power armor chassis?
---
Raider
---
The event was not what I expected either. Nor were the rewards.
---
That's what I was thinking, but I just wanted to make sure.  Still impressed with how well they've gotten things turned around nonetheless!
---
Game is unplayable now because of that
---
Grounded mutation should help. There's nothing wrong with the glass cannons waiting to hit the boss hard. I'm a strong believer in there being roles in a fight. Guys to tank the pylons. Guys to smash the robots and guys to demolish the boss. Bloodied builds should be okay with not being able to complete any and all events solo.
---
Actually no they didn't. And to answer a possible future question, my dad constantly put things off and didn't so that's part of why I think like that. If he made plans there was like a 50/50 chance so I just tell myself "no, probably not going to happen."
---
the robot spawns are completely broken i’m sure, there’s way too many and that assaultron is far too overpowered as well.
---
I did yes.
---
if you equip a full set it turns you into ghost rider
---
Thank you for all your inputs. After trying several variants this one finally does work for me with patch 8. Melee Damage works, all my three mods work and the excavator skin/paint also loads correctly ingame.

Thanks. This was the issue.
---
Holotape downstairs in the restraint area on a table. Took me awhile.
---
If that's it this update was awful
---
nvm...found the final one it's an easy one to miss
---
Unfortunately, i just realized that challenges were a big part of my play-time. Now that they are so much harder i don't feel motivated to log in again.
---
Took me a minute too lol
---
I got a 2* unyielding trapper chest +1 luck.
---
Agreed. I purchased atoms for the first time specifically to get the two new camo skins for PA. They’ve found my weakness.
---
Normally I’d agree, but Dailies are traditionally basic ass challenges.
---
I think I’m lost. I went to wolfs cabin and that ended a quest, no new quest started, no new instructions. Did I miss something?
---
Okay, I might come back to this game soon, heard some good things recently, except repair kits.
---
My only problem was that people couldn't read for the first few minutes so I had to be the conduit for all 3, let me tell you, I need to make a LOT more stims. :(
---
It's a quality event, I'm glad we have some challenging events and hope they add more like it.
---
What’s up with the Camera “weapon”?
---
Not talking about civil war top hat I’m talking 7nion and confed hat respectively
---
Hellyeah! Thats a lot of good news! Big thanks for all the QoL features!
---
Any word for the following bugs/suggestions?
---
* **\[BUG\] -** Hooded Rags taking up all armor slots, not counting as outift
---
* **\[BUG\] -** Weapon magazine always empty after loggin
---
* **\[QOL\] -** Quick eat / drink / read button ([https://imgur.com/gallery/ALXbj5S](https://imgur.com/gallery/ALXbj5S))
---
* **\[QOL\] -** Possibility to change the quick slot hotkeys
---
* **\[QOL\]** **-** Separate throw grenade key from bash key
---
* **\[QOL\] -** Prevent player from scrapping favorited items
---
* **\[QOL\] -** Perk cards loadouts
---
* **\[QOL\] -** Fast travel mat at [C.A.M.Ps](https://C.A.M.Ps)
---
* **\[QOL\] -** More inventory TABs?
---
I had not claimed or was trying to claim any workshops in the lobby
---
I normally farm the tower for loot to sell and on average the mobs there are low level
---
I have no misc quest, and no idea where to buy another card...typical broken first-day content release...
---
Huge patch...
---
But can someone please tell me where to find the keypad pylon plans?
---
Awesome!
---
Some people like to frame things in binary terms.  So Repair Kits have to be either pure ambrosia or as black as the depths of Tartarus and anyone who sees a middle ground is a fool. Life is rarely so stark though. These Kits definitely exist in a nebulous gray area; cause for concern if Bethesda uses their success to delve into less nebulous offerings (like selling weapons directly through the Atom shop).
---
So I get why some people are just pre-lighting their torches and making sure their pitchforks are sharpened but I mean yeah... we certainly didn't need the deluge of "NO KITS ATOM SHOP BLARGH QUIT GAME I WILL!" posts we got after the initial reveal.
---
So ... can they bring back the parade?
---
Haven’t seen it. Completed all the new stuff, then left the house for the day.
---
35
---
All mine are still lumped together, just by “known” instead of being at the top, there in alphabetical order by k and not the parenthesis
---
Fire the downvotes!
---
I died a lot, had to switch to a lot of defensive perks and PA because bloodied unarmed was not happening. After doing that it was OK.
---
Then don’t circumvent the limit and work with what you got?
---
I don’t think it is the white spring one.  I’ll be back home in a few and I’ll check again but this looks new.
---
Thanks real excited to start unlocking these
---
Is this worry based on some observed behavior by Bethesda in past titles, or something they've indicated they would consider doing? Or is it just a kind of conspiracy theory doing its rounds in your head right now as you worry about the slippery slope they are walking?
---
Thanks. My camp is in a pretty remote location and so far I've only been hit once by some random ghoul. But I haven't even gotten the level 1 perk yet so it won't be for a bit.
---
WHAT?!?!?! F*ck!!!! I knew I should have sold the extra six hats I have last night!!!%#%@$!!
---
You have to equip the perk "Home Defense", at it's various levels it lets you build different turrets.
---
If its battle royale I wil puke, and then immediately undownload FO76
---
Not the end of the world then. Hopefully it's repeatable. I demand satisfaction.
---
Wow, you take your vending arrangement seriously! This is the kind of detail-oriented enthusiasm we need behind these kinds of changes.
---
Just noticed it on Enclave as well
---
Pretty sure however many times Reddit lets me I’m
---
Not breaking any rules and I haven’t done that many comments your just looking for mine specially cause you hate me and triggered by what I have said i recommend getting over it and blocking me so I no longer can hurt our feelings
---
I never got one, as someone else triggered it. And I am NOT spending 2k caps on a timed event I will probably lose. That is ridiculous.
---
Good point
---
The event was not what I expected, and also died constantly (I’m level 124). Got a 3 star, exploding assault rifle from the body though. Pretty nice.
---
Same but me and my hubby.
---
one queen fight can go though over 10 cores using heavy vats in power armor so no.
---
People will just suicide to rest their kill count. Also i wonder what happens when half the server ties for kills.
---
I didn't look for them in the Atomic Shop. I did see one player say they couldn't find them... Maybe they listened or maybe they are coming with The Burrows in a couple weeks
---
You should have got a code as part of the quest when you open the cache. Strange might be bugged where loads of people are on trying it out?
---
Was it the cabin that is a new location on the map?
---
Selling something you craft for the amount the vendors pay isn't an exploit.  You're simply crafting and selling.
---
The just nerfed it.
---
It's April 9th we're is the stuff
---
Yeah. That’s where i “ended”
---
I did, about 100 of them. :(
---
Wont be playing that event till I get stocked back up.
---
Shit i would be too ashamed to post too if i worked for liars.
---
The main question for me was this guy the one who create the entirity of Radstag species ?
---
Yup, they give you four extra side quests
---
I can’t even access craft or repair/modify
---
Yeah i figured out that part. No one was grabbing the pylons so i grabbed em all and im pretty sure the wind killed me lol
---
How's their inventory?
---
Last week they posted in the Inside The Vault that it was being pushed back. :(
---
Apparently adding 35 levels to an assaultron makes it a god among men
---
Oh yea, the difficulty was not the problem for me. It was the god damn level 100+ players that couldn't read and left me to be the conduit for half of the fight. I'm still pissed a little after losing 100+ stimpaks.
---
Dang yeah that was a short questline if so
---
That’s one I wished I originally stated.
---
We gotta boycott the game as a community. It work for For Honors community
---
it wasn't difficult.
---
A bunch (7 or 8?) of random people of wildly varying levels, equipment and expertise came together in the server I was in and without any strategy or finesse we 'brute forced' it.
---
Yes, there were deaths and people ragdolling here there and everywhere, some stimpaks were used, but it only took us like 5-10 minutes to take that 'thing' down.
---
Once people stop doing what I did: see the event marker on the map &gt; join it &gt; shift into 'hulk smash' mode without even checking my perks or considering if there is a strategy to this is just going to be business as usual.
---
Weird... when I went there I searched the terminal and it started the event where you have fight the assaultron
---
Man that thing would look sweet in my C.A.M.P
---
Mods?
---
This was the main thing I was hoping for! Spewing it got missed, hopefully next patch. They did have to focus on a lot of survival mode changes after all.
---
Probably not lol. I just never really used any companions in previous games and really like the quiet, deserted wasteland in this game.
---
Can you be more specific because I don't see anything regarding it in the notes 🤔
---
the civil war tophats now cost 3 cloth and one leather each
---
I hope not, it's one of my dailies
---
If you just looking for any meat, probably watoga is the better place, but if you need live ants, this is the better spot but is very inconsistent unfortunately but works for that challenge .. I also noticed ants at fort defiance a few days ago which I never saw before, also inconsistent but they did appear there.
---
It's quite deliberate, I'm sure. Gotta make sure players can't buy anything with free Atoms alone.
---
Can see with mentats
---
I had to do the same for the first half of the event.
---
Heh I just assumed the joke was that you were supposed to sit there waiting for him to insult you and he never did.
---
I read the terminal, and nothing new started. There was another guy going along the same speed and quest as me (we didn’t talk but kept up with each other) and he just went back to his camp after he read the terminal. 
---
I’m gonna fast travel back and see if anything happens.
---
Lol game crashed during the event I started so I'm out 2k to do it again? Nice. Real nice.
---
You have to go into the new inspect option first and then you can repair it.
---
there we go...  
---
first, nice datamining. A thumb up  
---
second, see... bethesda. These skin even more effective than repair toolkits. Maybe i will charge atom in these thing.  
---
third, game performance drasmatically improved... still have some drop fps. Nice job.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/KV52Z9a
---
As far as I'm aware flamer fuel is still ridiculously expensive to craft/hard to come by. Unless that was stealthily fixed.
---
What no screenshot? What did it look like?
---
No, it's funny
---
Damn nice!! Could potentially be a super rare outfit so definately hold onto it
---
I’d have to start role playing as the goofball, the joker... the magician.
---
Lots of posts reporting the same thing. Appears to be a new bug in this patch
---
Couple places. Just google it, if you wanna find it now :)
---
Then we're in the exact same boat. Feels bad.
---
And when is that
---
:O
---
Probably after you beat the Boss
---
If they dont change repair kits delete the second half of your comment.
---
Just read through the terminal again, said I need to get a new key card. But no new mission started. I read about the pylons and all. Maybe ill server hop and see if that works.
---
🤷 okay I guess mileage will vary, because I Vats plenty, always in PA, don't run Power User (or w/e it's called), and did a hat trick of silos &amp; Queens last week on under ten cores. Usually wait till I'm low, then snag like 20+ from a generator or two over a couple hours, and then wait till I'm low again.
---
If you have any altered ini files, try deleting those and let me know if it is still invisible after that.
---
Is it a solo boss?
---
You get it by defeating the sheep squach imposter
---
Just seen a guy wearing the white sheep mask. But he didn't have voice chat on
---
Never got it. I think I went to the event when I thought I was going to the cache, entered the event, skipped the cache entirely, and broke my damn quest line. Sometimes this game just makes me want to pull my hair out. Do you remember where the cache was?
---
I believe when you trade it it gets reverted to it's default name, and I don't think you can trade a chassis with equipment on it.
---
&gt;!The outfit drops from the Impostor Sheepsquatch at the end of the Lying Lowe questline. It drops in parts and you may not get the whole thing in one go.!&lt;
---
I've noticed that every time I complete a challange that should rewards Atoms, my balance never increases..
---
Basement  wolf head
---
The bit about item assignment icons covers it in the Dev Notes
---
Wait that’s the end of the quest?
---
He spawned once for me but never insulted me :(
---
It was a skeleton in a lab coat. basically a Chinese scientist that was left in WV after the bombs dropped. He had a holotape explaining.
---
I didn't think of a screenshot, sorry! Kinda expected lots of people to be finding him.
---
But I love having my robots follow me around
---
Oh no no no no no no...&gt;!You will need at least a team of 4 to activate the pylons to make Sheepsquatch vulnerable and then she is still a pain in the arse to kill.!&lt;
---
Same here 1st time I and couple of random low level friends failed event but second time all know what to do. Great fun, and revards.
---
uh, didnt try because a only have one. Got 3 in the past but getting bored to put out the wrong one every time.
---
Tried it right now and yes, you can rename power armor also.
---
I mean that’s great and all but 2000 caps a pop? I think not.
---
If you like correcting typos read all my posts. You will keep yourself busy all day.
---
Hope youve got those biscuits
---
I finished it and I'm actually happy it's a bit harder then usually.
---
Apparently you need a keycard. I think I already had the key card on me which is way I started it immediately. Don’t what key card it is.
---
Ya but it was basically an exploit so it was only a matter of time. I knew it would happen in this update. Otherwise everyone would be max caps in no time
---
It was on the third floor of the garahnn (if that's how its spelt) estate building in boot of the car in the room :)
---
I wanna get robotic armor plans
---
I am also not a fan of Karma. But factions absolutely.
---
TARGET ACQUIRED!
---
I just want my jukebox to play The Ink Spots 24/7
---
Great name for the skins, Bone Raider is very...evocative.
---
That makes sense. Can't wait until I can get on and start naming my collection. Stu, Dave, Eugene, Constantine. 😃
---
happy to say my server completed it first try after i started the event, got the mascot outfit from it.
---
neither am I, I just mod a lot \^_\^
---
Well you cant wear them all at once, so wait until you have caps again nbd...but it is always to be expected. I basically buy 80% of stuff when it goes on sale anyways. I buy caps but make em stretch :)
---
Seems like it, nothing has triggered for me yet after, I know theres side quests at the taxidermy but that's it as of now I think. Which is a shame as the trailer showed off a real cryptid
---
This literally just happened to me!! Wonder if the ending of it is the event ??
---
Wait there’s a new event??
---
You make a fair point.  Players will figure it out eventually.
---
I'm just not that crazy about mandatory damage and time limits on a conceptual level.
---
How do you start them?
---
Ok, I got that. Where did you go from there?
---
I hated Witcher 3. It is more movie than rpg.
---
Do you guys plan on addressing the backlash against repair kits?
---
Hm. Thanks. I’ll figure it out sooner or later.
---
Cool. Anyone got a walkthrough for the quest? Been stuck in the stupid taxidermy place for about 2 hours. What's the use for the bone and where's the stupid fucking terminal password
---
Sadly before they changed the adventure mode, it often was.
---
Hope they don’t catch on to the marine wetsuit helmet... shhhhhh.....
---
I haven't heard the sound. Just came here to say I just went to the last terminal now and just ..nothing ..plain nothing. I went to Whitesprings to buy the keycard you need to make the assaultron recall-thing. Still nothing from the terminal. Supposedly there's an event called "Encryptid" that has to spawn, and something-something then we have to use one of our keycards and ..we kill it? I have no idea here, I'm just standing here hoping the event begins soon :P
---
no idea :(
---
Mr. Plow and Robot Downey Jr. are going to be my names for Excavator and X-01
---
Hey maybe if you post this reply 5 more times it wont get downvoted into oblivion
---
Meaning switch to it when sneaking around, and then switch back to other weapon to kill with. It has bonuses to sneaking.
---
Is she part of the quest or can you do her anytime like the queen?
---
I was teleported to a cliff for the drink nukashine quest and he was standing in front of me
---
Think I've seen two rad storms since I've played the game.
---
The beverage drinking challenged was nerfed after it showed up around 5-7 times, and there's still the stupid "craft 15 different types of alcohol" challenge that you'd only be able to do if you have been active in doing your Biv dailies  
---
It's wayyyyyyy too coincidental that these events have only been getting worse with time
---
Oh, I was totally agreeing with you.  That would be hilarious if not everyone who showed up knew it was a regular sized cricket
---
thank you for this!! its too bad there are only about 10 clean item variants :(
---
...but this gives me a few outfits to hunt down that I haven't seen yet! :)
---
Stimpacks: pokey Healy thingy
---
Yep end of the quest,and im most dissapointed that you dont fight the real sheepsquatch...kinda saad since the quest and hype was about it
---
Thats what mine did, i wasnt sure if it was a bug or not
---
I DC after it told me to go to the recall sight and the quest disappeared after I reconnected
---
It’s not that hard to get the caps daily. I know it’s not super efficient but go to wetch railroad and just kill all the mole miners and sell everything you got, I usually get around 1000~ but I don’t have enough storage capacity so I just scrap the remaining. If that doesn’t work, then go to Harper’s ferry, which I’m pretty sure gives more.
---
Houdini off server xDD
---
Go to the top floor, there's a notice board with more quests
---
Join the enclave
---
I must have missed the silwer skin
---
Hope you figure it out.
---
the hell do you expect from a side quest. we'll get another one in a bit and then a big one this fall.
---
She's an event called "Encryptid" if I remember right. Basically, &gt;!you use the terminal at the Pylon Ambush Site with the piece from Wolf's stash and the event begins. Prepare to die a lot.!&lt;
---
Yeah, have seen this before but not this bad. Can't move half walls or full walls at all.
---
Relogging or making foundations/stairs do not work.
---
Ya and at that with the new max sale value being also nerfed to 15c you would have to sell 93 a day to make 1400c. If you want to farm 280 cloth and 93 leather a day you go for it. I am going to find another easy way to earn caps because you will not be able to find cloth 2 for 1 cap for very much longer because people are going to buying the crap out of it.  The value of cloth and leather will probably stabilize to where you can make a tophat for 5-7 caps if you are just purely buying matts on the forums and sell it for 15, but personally that is not enough profit per day for me.
---
Who knows, they said they’re aware of it and working on it. No clue why it’s taken so long considering the fix is already known and easy: it doesn’t have the “Weapon” prefix in the game files.
---
I’m use my right arm often myself....
---
mine too. Just ended and no completion of anything, or anything :P I think there should be an event starting at some time but I have no clue.
---
People complained the game was getting too easy, I for one like the boss actually being dangerous instead of just a bullet sponge. (Looking at you SBQ!). 
---
Now if they improved the rewards.....to compensate for the higher difficulty.....
---
I came into a fight without realising that it was the event. Wasn't disappointed with the difficulty. But it did look like they didn't know what they were doing. I know I didn't (but I just decided to join in) until I look at the pylons properly and the notifications.
---
That’s beautiful, man.
---
&gt; Shopping mall = watoga train station/graham
---
And Mr. Squeeze, I guess they called it Shopping Mall because so many were under that umbrella.
---
The Chinese scientist guy? That has been before this patch.
---
I’ll do it right now and lyk!
---
Hoping theres more to it and this is just bugged atm?
---
Didn't seem to bad with randoms just now. They figured out and took care of the pylons while I vampire speared it to chunks.
---
Read through the messages on the terminals and notes, they give hints for what you need to do, password for the terminal is on a note. And as for the bone, 'Give the dog a bone'.
---
Eh, they needed to be nerfed. We're selling replicas not antiques.
---
Instigating's great on a hunting rifle, but you really want a handmade rifle as well for forced close-range engagements or killing landed scorchbeasts. If you're doing one-gun-for-everything then the lever rifle is a better option, but I'd rather have lever+handmade there too.
---
Is the Excavator PA skin going to be there for 4 days only? D: I think it's what  it says in the Atomic Shop. I'm considering buying atoms to get it and the others.
---
Make sure your prepared is all I can say. It's a tough fight
---
Apparently theres a head too
---
If you read the damn patch notes, there is.
---
There are 3 dailies today that r pretty much impossible for me. Not to mention the weeklies!! I am not happy.
---
I welcome it :P But ..is it at the pylon-place? I can't see any indicators that anything is supposed to happen.
---
Pretty sure only Helvetia had a timeline, these new things don't for sure
---
They left out some material cost increase and cap value decrease in some craftable items out of the patch notes. If they left that out, what else did they leave out?
---
Will do, but it worked before, nothings changed. Did Bethesda change something?
---
Same. I just started doing the side stuff for the moment. It seems like that was on a timer or something.  Just based on reading.
---
My quest dissapeard just before the quest completed and then nothing. It's really strange
---
There are glowing creatures everywhere. The storm is the hard part.
---
I have 1 piece of chameleon armor, chameleon mutation, and the card for 2.5x dmg with rifle sneak attack . I tried both in power armor and without power armor. They cant see the Y icon on me for some reason.
---
Everything is an issue, price nerfed to 15 caps so you need to make 93 a day. 93 a day so you need to farm 280 cloth per day. I don't know where you farm cloth but watoga hs gives like what half of that so you would need to hit other locations on top of finding the 93 leather. It is all bullshit.
---
Same
---
so, any idea on what I do? just wait?
---
As much as I adore the Renaming thing why did they put it on the workbench and make repairing more of a hassle (plus it's buggy and removes the viewable stats)
---
Strange, it was working for me yesterday.
---
I believe they revert back to scrap available to next player
---
Mate! Put a spoiler alert in stuff like this!
---
Sweet! Thanks for the update! Wasn’t expecting a response. Glad to hear it’s coming up
---
Nuclear Red Bull
---
Or ManBearPig
---
Personally once I find out I am keeping it a secret LOL. I wish you luck
---
&gt; has tons of videos explaining how to exploit
---
If makes the game less of a grind therefore it's an exploit. Ridiculous claim I see repeated daily.  It it does nothing to the value of caps.  If you are selling to vendors, you can make a maximum of 1400 caps  a day.  That's true if you are selling them top hats or mole miner gauntlets.
---
If you leave the server or lose it to another player everything you built stays there. I've taken an unowned workshops with everything all setup for me by the previous owner.
---
There are quite a few outfits that don't have clean in their name but still look clean.
---
The map in the taxidermy place
---
Hotfix needed. Was planning to finally jump in on Survival when I saw this in the patch notes. Will have to hold fire now :(
---
I suspect the OP said shopping mall meaning the SuperDuperMart in Watoga, but that is Phoenix who is the BOS vendor.
---
It doesn't really matter. There are five of them being added to the WhiteSpring, and MODUS is downstairs (confusingly via the third floor).
---
They already got away with it with CAMP/Settlement players and unique assets.
---
You have to open the terminal and start an event that spawns the sheepsquatch impostor
---
I feel like this was already a quest since ive already been there and cant seem to start it
---
I accidentally untracked the new quest, and can't find anywhere to track it again. :/
---
Having the same issue
---
Just be aware you are opening yourself up to PvP anywhere on the map once you take the workshop
---
"Fix energy weapons? Nah, fuck that, we're nerfing milk."
---
Anything happening about all the server freezes and disconnects, I am having more now since the last patch (not this one). The load screens take ages to load and then when I am in a world I get "server controls temporarily suspended" and then a disconnect from server.
---
I agree. I kinda want a base defense mode/event where you can trigger the event and it shows up on the map. Would certainly make for some interesting gameplay.
---
I guess just wait. Check the map every so often and see if peeps are gathering at the location. And knock out some challenges for atoms. Time will tell.
---
Yeah this event was absolute garbage, constantly loosing health and and an abundance of Stimpacks there's like 15 bots always swarming around you. Me and a group of others managed to kill it and what do I get rewarded with... A one star Ski Sword.
---
Me too!
---
Yes sir, came here for this. Can't put my Calibrated Shocks on my X-01. Also, my newly crafted PA pieces have different health bar lengths...
---
Hmm...well maybe I have a card, but it wouldn't let me start the event again...I'll have to look in my inventory. Any idea where you get a new one once you use it?
---
Jesus the Union hat must be dead as well.
---
Well the bot in game is called Shopping Mall Vendor.
---
*Cheddar Bay* biscuits
---
YES! can't wait to get home now just for that!
---
Same here! No quest to follow anymore. Sadface!
---
oh? so the quest ends here and it's an event? if so that is pretty bad.
---
You know this was something I did a long time ago but being able to walk even over encumbered to a vendor does make life easy. Hell this might be the new meta, farming near vendors LOL.
---
Is this a serious question?
---
I'm not.
---
&gt; Also, what's to keep me and a couple of friends from camping off in a corner and farming ourselves for commendations for a few hours? 
---
" Players must be alive a minimum amount of time to be worth commendations. This is to prevent kill farming. "
---
Second line.
---
&gt; While many of your ideas are well thought out and explained, it misses the point. Survival isn't set up to reward player killing, it's to make player interactions costly if they go wrong. It's meant to make raider an actual playable character type. 
---
The incentives I've listed are for both PvE play and PvP. Want to earn exp and complete quests / challenges and grind? Go for it. You'll also get commendations and increased exp for the longer you live. Want to hunt players as a raider? You can do that as well, but it's a lot more risky. PvE would be more consistently rewarding, but PvP could have big payoffs.
---
I disagree with "survival isn't set up to reward player killing". Currently, you are HIGHLY encouraged to shoot first should you encounter another player. The thing that stops people from murdering one another in a theoretical post apocalyptic wasteland is morality and basic human decency, and that's something that I think would be present no matter how bad things got. Yes, you'd have horrible people, but I think humans on their own are more inclined to not go the violent route. We have empathy. However, we have no problem murdering each other in video games, and there's no way to make people behave in game like they would IRL. 
---
I have to ask... what 'player interaction' are you talking about in regards to survival? It's a murder fest. That is the only player interaction. If you see another player, you either shoot first and live, or you die. That's just how it is with these kinds of game modes. The insanely low time to kill doesn't help. If you get hit first, you die 90% of the time. If you get the jump, you can usually win. In survival, you're either someone I know and that I trust and will group up with, or you're a potential enemy that I must either avoid or kill. If you stop to chat with someone and see if they're actually hostile, you're already dead.
---
The system I'm outlining would reward both "good" players that don't go out seeking pvp, as well as people that want to play as actual raiders.
---
So I bought a few things. I am loving the baaaad Billy outfit!
---
~~the card you get, is it a one time use only?~~
---
I don’t think it’s an event. Maybe it’s a team required ending. Or something.
---
My level 99 character was being one-shot by the assaultron. Luckily I had a bunch of other players to help me kill it.
---
My friend before the patch received a notification that Insult Bot had insulted him, it then attacked him and one-shotted him.  But I don't think Insult Bot is actually powerful though, this same guy is a level 60 who has essentially become a 4 Strength Melee Bloodied Build who almost died to a level 5 player and level 2 player.
---
I legit guffawed at this.
---
Regardless, it's a pvp mode, what do people expect?
---
did mats required increase?
---
good idea, I'm stealing that. :)
---
Hard out man I feel ur pain ...I got play it after work:/
---
Bethesda are throttling the atom earning it seems.
---
I hopped on thinking I was getting a robo companion
---
Ada was made in Appalachia confirmed?
---
I have heard from people that the quest ends with the event
---
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
---
You get the side quests from the map on the wall inside the house you look for the original clues
---
In Fo4, I mostly would just add a + or = at the beginning to keep the stuff I wanted to save separate.
---
I imagine the sheepsquatch has been added to the list of cryptids that can spawn in the world.
---
hmm, either way suddenly taking the quest away and leaving you with nothing isn't a good design.
---
Oh, leave the community manager's alone. They have literally no say in what's included in the patch notes.
---
I saw that, went berserk. Hope they take us back there when we do get them!
---
OK, on my 2009 Sony Bravia, under screen/display area. I had to chose Full Pixel.
---
All is well now... LOL!
---
It's the quick and lazy answer. Maybe one day they'll remodel lol (they also all use the securtiy protectron voice)
---
Complete overreaction
---
Yeah I'm aware of a bunch like that, I'm more intrigued by the variant versions. :)
---
What are ingredients for the marine tactical again?
---
Someone told me it’s an event. As you have to fight “the thing “ and some adds. So a semi group is needed.
---
Yeah it takes place there :) you gotta activate the recall on the terminal to get it to start. Hopefully loads of other players join you
---
My robot was so op in fo4, made the game really easy
---
I want to make my op bot.
---
I feel your pain, what a horrible occurrence.  If I was you, I'd buy mu serums for 100caps and then sell them to the vendor for 400.  Think about all the time and resources you'd save.
---
OMG the warrider PA Skin... directly out from the elder scrolls!!!!!!! MINEEEEE
---
welp, i'll wait around with some youtube on a guess, 10/10 game design
---
Based upon the datamine i saw, they're gonna be getting quite  abit from me real fucking soon.
---
I had this same thing happen
---
Oh thank god i thought it was just me!!!
---
I think this is the only change in this patch (other than Brahmin Milking) that I dislike, I enjoyed the risk and reward of losing a bunch of caps and aid items because you had to really think about what you brought with you, and what stayed in your stash.  Gaining doubke the caps you'd normally get was rewarding, and losing double the caps potentially devastating.  Same with aid items.  It just seems like the beginning of a big mistake for them to potentially make Survival incredibly similar to Adventure.  Next thing you know we'll have slap damage in invulnerable bases in Survival, and a working Pascifist Mode.
---
Guess I won't be chatting anymore. Kinect gets no respect.
---
Yeah every so often I guess a cool down, not sure how long it is though. No worries that's what we are all here for, to help one another :) 
---
I believe once used the first time you do have to craft it yourself.
---
How is a simple haberdasher supposed to earn a *living* in this post-apocalyptic world anymore
---
The robot spawns are obviously broken, not even someone without a physical brain could purposefully add a robot spawn that spawns in 5 robots every 10 seconds, its completely mad.
---
me -too  - it would be nice if someone can confirm - I can try and test tonight ...
---
One time only. They're 2k caps to buy at vendors each.
---
&gt;Correct me if I’m wrong, but there are Perk Cards that reduce the weight of everything for heavyweapons, junk, and aid. It sounds like you should do some more homework into your own build then just copy one from a builds website. It also sounds like you are carry around way to much stuff on you. 
---
I already run what weight saving perk cards I can that don't force me to remove damage dealing perks. I actually got my build directly from the FO76 builds website, was the most popular heavy gunner/ Power Armor build.
---
&gt;Just because you have your build a certain way that doesn’t sound to beneficial still doesn’t make repair kits P2W. Also in no way do I think heavy weapons is the most popular build by any means. 
---
For PvE after the TSE nerf? Yeah miniguns are the best DPS with anti armor explosive for the SBQ.
---
As for carrying too much stuff, I have nowhere to put away anything else in my stash, as it is full of crafting items such as stable fluxes and hardened masses. 
---
Remember those perk cards don't matter with weight in your stash, so if you put things in your stash the weight perk cards don't help at all. 
---
My build is the most common build on the FO76 build site, so it isn't just me who would have huge benefits for it, it would be everyone with the same build as me(I'm using the basic heavy weapon/PA build) which is the most common PVE build out now.
---
So yes this is pay 2 win, and it goes against what they promised. They promised that the atom shop would be only cosmetics and NEVER sell anything that effects gameplay. So the fact they straight up lied and went with P2W this quick is beyond screwed up. 
---
The only thing that makes me happy about the whole situation is knowing the modders are almost done and about to release private servers for FO76 very soon, so I'll be able to laugh at BGS as they  continue to make terrible decision after terrible decision, while playing on a modded server without worry of what dumb shit Bethesda is going to try to pull next patch.
---
Yeah same here , quest just ended at the cabin and no misc quest . I got the keycard thanks to Reddit , kinda strange it just ended with no explanation
---
He's a highly advance AI that controls a secret government bunker. Follow the main quest and you'll get there
---
Got the mask my first try and I saw someone on here get a cool hat! I wonder what all there is.
---
However if you don't want to create a new character it becomes tough. I am level 195 and ran every event in the Cranberry Bog and a couple in The Mire yesterday a couple of times along with a couple of daily events. I only leveled up once. So unless I play all day and night I will not be able to level up 3x in 24 hours.
---
This is great, I am going to be starting a new character!
---
Yea it's caps sink to keep economy in some sort of balance i guess
---
Spoilers wtf
---
Civil war dress is 2 cloth 1 crystal and i sell it for 17c
---
The only reason I survived at all was because I was in my PA spamming stims. Without spamming I would have died 10 times over.
---
I mean the idea is cool. If the thing is as terrifying as it’s read about. I enjoy the idea of an event to stop it.
---
Is the game worth getting into at this point? I love the Fallout series but I didn't get into this game when I heard about the terrible beta and even worse launch. I just want something else to play and if I do get into it, should I get it on Xbox or on PC?
---
Damn ok
---
They already said it's okay to give them feedback.  This is feedback.
---
Same here. With a RTX 2060 i5-4690K i play IT ok low preset. I get 90-100 fps but when things gets messy the fps drops to 40-50 and its crappy. This game is poor optimezed.
---
Not having a go at your opinion, but what level are you. It's really not that much of a grind to end up with stuff to sell. Just don't think about it. Go and explore, collect whatever, aid items, collect stuff to bulk. Hit up a run through Whitesprings. Visit some people along the way. Craft some other crap, and before you know it you're done. I appreciate you don't have much time to play the game, but long as you're making some caps one of those days, you'll be ok. And eventually you'll end up wit decent legendaries, you may be able to sell to another player. Good luck out there :)
---
I thought Hogzilla was from Georgia.  Is there a West Virginia one too?
---
Anybody figure out where the player vending machine setupis
---
And I just dropped my troubleshooter .50cal..... Stupid me lol
---
I mean sure but you'd think they'd tell you so I'd not be asking on reddit, it literally vanished the moment i went on that terminal with no hint of what comes next
---
Does anyone know if the mounted cat heads are included in them? Like form the crazy cat lady house near morgantown high?
---
I’m really hope that’s not all I was expecting the dungeon today but nope it’s next week :(
---
Yeah, I saw you can do that at the Tinker's bench. But it requires an "Assaultron Recall Circuit Board" to craft. I wonder where you get those from?
---
Yes, Pete Hines literally said the Atom shop would be only cosmetics and never be anything that effected gameplay. This effects gameplay. Thus lying, just because you don't understand what P2W means doesn't mean it isn't P2W, it is and that is why everyone is telling you that you are wrong.
---
There was like 20 people at my event and we failed still  and now I have no idea how I even trigger / try again . Would suck if you fail and that's it .
---
Charisma also influences the price.
---
Had really bad case of that going on for a long time. Actually 10 minutes into the game. Near the crashed space station at my camp. Did it repeatedly while I killed mutants attacking my camp. Maybe today's patch will correct some of that.
---
And you choose to use your time playing the game grinding out hats for caps?
---
Feels good doesn't it??
---
I'm a melee build too, and had this same issue until I maxed out my enforcer card, now I can bring them to the ground pretty quick with a shotgun and go to town on it with my melee weapon.
---
if you check the new datamine, a nukashine paint job is coming which looks on point
---
Bethesda has been monitoring the playing statistics during the beta. If they made a move this drastic there was a reason. The reason should be simple: **People weren't playing survival as much as expected.** 
---
Having spent a lot of resources building this gameplay mode, Bethesda wants people to play it. Reduce the risk/reward and maybe bring people back to it. 
---
It is only the beta. This won't be the last change. I look forward to the day when Survival is a fun, balanced environment. Not a exploit riddled cap suck.
---
Where do you “learn the truth about the albino creatures”?? I’m confused, I tried going to Johnson’s Acre because it mentioned a cabin
---
by explaining to me that you think this is p2w tells me for a fact that you don't even know what you're talking about
---
I've read that vendors at whitesptings sell them for 2000 caps a pop
---
I can confirm they are lol
---
Thanks for the attention. It’s 190409-003159 . I’ve listed two issues, consistent freezing and random sort order of friends list.
---
Saw this at a Whitesprings vendor, what does it do?
---
brb uninstalling
---
Just rename everything "Power Armor Chassis" like God intended.
---
Ruined the cap grind or balanced an exploit? Hmmmmm
---
I thought that was the case. It is most definitely the hardest. Mostly because people seem confused when attempting it. I'm grateful that there is another hard boss to fight. Hopefully it won't get nerfed.
---
This. My level 340 insane dps bloodied heavy gunner is so fucking ready.
---
Nope. Merge issues still plague the game. Bugs and they keep doing worse.
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.engadget.com/amp/2019/04/09/fallout-76-horse-armor/
---
It seems you were the one who was misunderstanding things, they are selling the repair kits in the atom shop, not a plan to make them.
---
Day one bugs and stuff always exist. It really doesn’t bother me too much. If it intended that way. Then it’s kinda shafty. If the server is just drunk that’s another thing.
---
I feel ya, I would of liked to of seen the dungeon with this update. I'm hoping theres a way to find the real sheepsqautch maybe its hidden and it's up to us to find it?
---
What happened to the player vending?
---
Watching you two fight would be ribbeting.
---
Luckily for me I had 400 stims on me. Protip: use marsupial or a jetpack to get on top of the shack and avoid the assaultron's melee attacks.
---
It requires caps to start it?
---
Thank you. Had to scroll too far for this.
---
Helmet is only in the dev room
---
Play it for 100 hrs then decide. It's different than single player Fallout and takes a little while to adjust. They have made some improvements.
---
I did Survival for the first time over the weekend. I did the 150 critical hits in Watoga(tip: use a shotgun, each critical hit = 8 critical hits), but before that a ran around nadj sut tried to level up my level 30. I played for like 5 hours on that mode and was only killed 3 times. And once I actually killed two people who were hunting me. It was pretty fun, but I don't think I'd do it very often. Maybe just if the Survival Challenge is interesting.
---
I think the best part of survival is the tension and dread of knowing that anyone you come across is probably going to kill you. But actually coming across someone sucks because I don't want to be killed, nor did I ever want to hunt anyone down. It's a weird catch-22 for me.
---
Yea 100%. Just went back to a bench to check. After you hit inspect/repair the screen is blank and you can flip your gun around to look at it but no options appear to me.
---
https://youtu.be/f4Ebf0Ak448
---
Haha, you're welcome
---
Uh, where are you getting this idea they are selling a plan? The patch came out, they are just selling the repair kits, no plans to make them.
---
For me, I guess it's back to water farming.  That said, I did make it to about 20,000 caps before they changed it.
---
This will be the name of my firstborn.
---
you'll get squashed ;-)
---
Just a heads up they changed the recipes on a number of clothing items, not just the hats.
---
Skelly hats and costumes now require bone in addition to increased cloth and plastic prices.
---
I need help with this. Mom's note says low heat and delicates but when I do that nothing happens.
---
I think glass, rubber, clothed (or leather) haven’t been on post patch so not sure if this has changed
---
You can definitely have some fun
---
I paid $20 to get the x-01 blackbird paint and am still happy with that decision months later
---
Because it is the new norm of online gaming.
---
Those shadows hurt my heart.
---
The one that looks kind of silvery? Totally a one day buy at least a month ago.
---
Ewwww...no WAY am I dropping 2k caps for an event everyone is consistently losing. Nope. No way.
---
We need more hard as shite bosses that drop extremely rare loot, IMHO. I applaud if it is tough.
---
So they balanced an exploit?
---
Ya'll really need to stop the whole "fix everything but not the things i like" bullshit.
---
Yea it's been around from the lauch i believe. Atleast i've seen it weeks ago for first time.
---
So i just saw a picture of the sheepsquatch and oh my god we need the ability to get Cryptid Heads to put on racks for our camps.
---
IKR? The four horsemen-themed Power Armor paint jobs? Yes please. Here's the damned credit card info Bethesda, do your worst!
---
Cool your jets.  There is actually no way to disable the news popup.  It will appear every time you login.
---
I hit the limit before tophats got nerfed. womp womp
---
Check the calendar.
---
And with a lot of imagination, you don't even need to buy the game :D
---
First time is free then you need to make a new recall card. The missing mat to make it is about 2k.
---
Yea it’s the gilded mini gun which when picked up is no longer a gilded mini gun, but one can drop as loot and can be sold to collectors
---
Currently at work, but can you go to say....morgantown station and sell 1400 caps worth of items there? Or only at whiteprings?
---
Do you have any insight on what the likely cause(s) of the divorce will be?
---
I hope so. This game has nothing difficult in it right now.
---
Absolutely.
---
Dude can you tell me what to do with the dryer and washer in Lowe‘s basement? I’m tonstupid... I read Mom‘s note over and over and try all kind s of settings. Nothing.
---
Must Love Nukes
---
Ah OK. Thanks for confirming! I've never seen him before.
---
No more having three sets of PA, one for looks, one for utility, and one for nuke zones. No more getting sick of that and having to spend several minutes searching for a good set to go into the zone with. Now I can just look for a good one and grab it. 
---
Yay!
---
I do
---
Still no fix for tamed pets then :/
---
I mean the dude was complaining he can’t sell his hats for caps when it takes 3 seconds to farm near Welch or Harper’s. Obviously he is oblivious to the farming near vendors so I had to put him in
---
That's why my ass is content with Adventure mode, until I level a new character a bit. Not sure what you are expecting, but they do it because they can, and for them it's fun. And camping you is lame, but of course that's gonna happen too. 
---
Nothing will change this. No matter how strong your base is it's going to happen. You're not going to get Adventure mode chill in Survival. 
---
Good luck out there :)
---
Sorry for all the questions, what's the missing mats? I have a mule filled with a lot of junk =)
---
You gotta mark the calendar then it triggers a hidden door on the left side of them
---
That nukashine paint is a definite must for me.
---
I sincerely hope these dungeons and raids are TOO difficult. I want to try it solo and get my ass kicked and handed to me. I want to have to fight and swing and push through every Aid item and broken weapon I own to make it to the other side.
---
I think if they make the repair kit cheap enough, then it won't be a pay to win problem event you have to buy it per item. Every day you get 5 daily challenges, and at lease 2-3 can be done easily,l which gives you \~20-30 points. I would say if a repair kit cost no more than 50pt is reasonable. It also gives you more motivation to finished those daily changeless.
---
Kim Jong Un’s Cocaine Bar ™ is delicious.
---
Weekly, maybe. Daily? That would be a disaster. The vast majority of the player base doesnt have 2000 caps a day to spend on a dungeon run. Especially since it's highly unlikely that anything you get out of there would be worth close to 2000 caps. Also you run into the problem of they are building this dungeon up to be a team effort. Does everyone in the team need one to access the dungeon? Otherwise you're fighting over who spends 2k for the team to access it.
---
What Exploit is that Exactly ? Because you definitely had to Farm materials to make them not to mention being lucky enough to even find the plans . For all the Effort it took to even get the plans server hopping for hours Etc sometimes not even getting the plan but getting the body . No it Ruined the Grind. Nothing about it was exploitable Because you still have to wait for the caps to respawn and you're only getting 1400 caps in a 20 hour span . Oh well The Game Just Keeps Getting More Boring . It was already a Grindy Game in the first place this was just unnecessary. Especially when other players are trading Duped Gear for 1000s of caps .
---
I always figured it would taste like (Hpnotiq)[http://www.liquordirect.ca/Hpnotiq-Liqueur-P3669.aspx] without the aftertaste of the cheap vodka...
---
Don’t put Repair Kits in the Atom Shop, Bethesda. Otherwise you’re going to waste all of these amazing skins on a displeased player base.
---
You new to the game? It's not available. Its probably not going to be added even tho it was found in the files
---
One thing I’ve noticed is that I haven’t bought the skin, but upon item inspect of my excavator pieces, they showed that it did have the skin, but not i
---
Factions *do* need quests, but as a longtime WoW player: if they ever introduce a faction reputation grind, I'm out.
---
odd
---
There goes the 100 dollars I got a week ago
---
Glad to hear I’m not going insane. It’s definitely pretty inconsistent, because I had failures installing both to an Excavator and a T-60.
---
I was one hit killed 10 times (im level 195)....first time playing the event...we had level 225s getting MOPPED up
---
Yea you do have to rely on other players heavily and just hope they understand it too, of course acting as a source of energy means you'll take damage over time but if you're experiencing lag it might be a bit confusing or inconsistent so keep an eye out on your health.
---
Sadly no,im so dissapointed i was hyped when i started the questline along with other side quests that you get,clues were interesting,each side quest had its own story but it was centered all around sheepsquatch,then in the end i was like omg gonna fight the sheepsquatch!but no...you fight a robot with a sheepsquatch clothing...and the real sheepsquatch is gonna be a random encounter like mothman i guess..but the point in the trailer was to fight the real deal!not a knockoff robot that is 1 shooting everyone :))
---
The only thing I'll spend money on is DLC 
---
I can see them trying loot crates like ESO though. That's where I think they are heading.
---
I sell bulk junk to vendors every day , cloth , rubber , glass , leather, etc. that is all I have ever sold to vendors. Once player vending here maybe some of y'all can do business with me. I'm on PS4 every day from 5pm -10pm US central time. Gamer tag is same as my name here.
---
I think they're only going to get worse TBH. Data probably shows that people are hoarding atoms from challenges and not buying enough from the store. Hence now challenges are becoming harder/borderline impossible.
---
No problem !
---
Have you forgotten about the shit that they’ve done since launch..?
---
I think I was near the mess hall when it started
---
I have multiple times. Even restarted my game.
---
&gt;I am assuming that people in survival with their weapons holstered ie yellow names are considered neutral. This needs testing to be verified.
---
They are. This QOL change has inadvertently become a counter to people who use VATS to attack people.
---
There must be a timer or maybe it's a one time event per server, I bought an extra and havent been to trigger the quest at the terminal. Any ideas what to do?
---
I get that sometimes trying to get power to water purifiers.  What seems to work for me is to connect it the other way round. Eg, instead of generator to purifier, I go purifier to generator.  Not sure if this will work with conduits though.
---
im glad some of the PA skins arent just color based skins, some feature different shaped pieces. i suppose now is the time to bite the bullet and pay for atoms since its gonna take wayyyyy to long to grind challenges between chars to build up for all the nice lookin stuff
---
Lockpicking and hacking were kept as separate cards so Bethesda could control the level at which players unlock all three. There isn't really a reason to prevent players from doing this though.
---
ty - thanks for the heads up !!  I also found a carbon skin that looks great...
---
Good thing we can name our chassis now, because I'm definitely expanding beyond my current seven sets for those paints.
---
lol, it's still google, just with the results anonymized basically.
---
And building. I am (was) trying get caps to buy plans. I mean I am lvl 132, and the only challenge is the SBQ, which I dont encounter happening much. So the hat making was an easy, fast way to clear caps in the little times I have to play. But c'est la vie, I will just find another way, eh?
---
I am sorry, you typed the number 5 wrong. Unless I am crazy when I looked a few min ago the suit, dress, and uniforms are all now 5 cloth.
---
Co-op would be sick.  Bring back the story driven game and let friends delve into the lore together.  That's my main disappointment with 76, that is , something about the way the 'story' was being revealed failed to immerse me.
---
That's not accurate. They needed to make sure that bulk items could be auto-scrapped when you crafted because they weren't. You'd have to manually scrap a bulk item in order to use it's contents in crafting. They fixed that by making them auto-scrappable, but that unfortunately made that also occur when you "scrap all". They felt this current functionality was better than the alternative and I believe they said they'd try to rework the system later for both functions to operate correctly. But they haven't stated anything further to my knowledge.
---
Well you’re in for a treat!
---
Huh!? That’s crazy. It looked pretty sick that’s for sure! I would want it to keep that’s for sure. Thanks for the info!
---
Yeah, I tried this as well. Saw another post about this and it suggested that. Still not working. Very frustrating :( Thanks for the suggestion!
---
In regards to the time out:  if I've got 4 friends, I'll go and kill each one by one, then we line up again for person 2.  How long is this wait timer? 5 minutes? An hour? If it's short we can wait, maybe grab some crops or manage inventory.  If it's long it will nice to get if you do kill someone, but not reliable enough to provide a hunting incentive. 
---
Second, I've actually made more friends in Survival than in Adventure.  I do my best to not turn every encounter into a fight.  High level players gave me decent legendaries and food, and I've tried to pay it forward with other lower levels.  It means more that someone gave me soup when they could have as easily shot me in the face.  That tension is absolutely not for everyone but I don't think I could go back to Adventure now because it wouldn't be the same. 
---
And I'm no pvp built monster but I do alright.  Recently got the Good Grief trophy for killing 20 players.  I never killed in Adventure mode, my character wasn't built for it.  Not everyone is there to kill, but for the additional challenges that Survival mode places, in addition to human interaction being risky.
---
I dont think so, but there are feral hogs in the hils, for sure.
---
Energy amd heavy weapons are still buffed, however some people are complaining about their melee builds doing less damage.
---
Were the price of Union Hats changed?
---
450 caps on Xbox.
---
1 recall keycard circuit board. You won't have one, they've been introduced with the patch.
---
The cap is 1400 a day from vendors , so they could say if you max caps (which they just made easier) every other day you could enter a dungeon.  Of course the dungeon would need to support such massive cover charge.  Could drop tokens which you collect to exchange for a legendary of your choosing.  So you could effectively farm whatever you want... eventually. Complete speculation but the game absolutely needs a better cap sink.
---
In this made up opinion of mine, everyone would need to front the 2k
---
Everyone is NOT tagged as hostile. By default they are friendly unless they pull out their weapon.
---
The intent was to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment
---
Yeah, I'm hoping they change this and realise it's too much for an event. Until then just keep checking to see when others activate it and just join :)
---
Right behind the terminal. It's the bumper of the car on display.
---
I cant find the wilfs cache. Any tip pls?
---
The new WarRider power armor looks cool as hell, saving my atoms for that
---
It really didn't take much effort to farm cloth though.  Pre-War Money is pretty much everywhere and otherwise virtually useless.
---
Gotta admit it took me a while lol. Ppl kept coming and going but I held on in haha.
---
This was the sheer terror update I’m pretty sure
---
The item you buy at the vendor is actually just part of the recipe to make the event item. Go to a tinkerers workbench and make another, although it does need flux from nuked areas (only 1)
---
I’m stuck here too
---
Yes I loving being an irradiated schoolbus
---
NO FUCKING WAY I JUST ASKED FOR THAT IN THE PATCH NOTES THREAD
---
GT JadeRane
---
You got an one-time use Assaultron Recall Code you can use to start the unique event for the whole server. The event will go on a cooldown after started, and you will get message ABORTED in the terminal in the cabin.
---
I thought that even when factoring in the plastic being used, bulking only saves weight on Lead and Aluminum.
---
I’m level 121, also got level 30.
---
What Have they Fixed? I still Disconnected within 15 minutes of Being On Though and Every "Fix" They do just adds Fuel to the fire , They Try to improve their Game but it Honestly just keeps Going downhill so I Have no idea what you Mean by that Except the Few QOL Changes .
---
It’s on the map. Near Kerwood Mine
---
But they Nerf'd the Civil War Top hat, it half the value, and twice the resources to make.  I have a family of Deathclaws to feed and I owe caps to the Scorched do you know how i sufferable the Scorched when you owe them caps. They're like the kid from better of dead mixed with the borg.
---
okay, thanks :) any idea how to grab one?
---
1 trip to camden park should get you close
---
Every time I've ignored someone or tried to be friendly (outside of events) in survival, I've been killed when they had a tactical advantage. Maybe that just come with being level 340 and the fact that if I die it's a 680 cap pay day for someone, but EVERYONE has been hostile to me, so I've learned to shoot first, always. I guess I'm a jaded asshole now, but I trust no one, I assume everyone is hostile. There's no time to fight back if they do start a fight with you, because the time to kill is less than a second. 3 shots of my .50 cal is all it takes typically, maybe a 5 if they run assn/sent.
---
it's in the cars trunk on the top floor
---
Oh shoot, didnt know that, thanks for the info.
---
As of today? I played last night and got a couple legendaries though they're were just normal ones. No three stars or anything
---
You still had to Go And Farm it it doesn't just land on your lap pal
---
Just found it sorry
---
They don’t have any mods
---
It's sad that we live in an age where we have to actually suggest making an item a quest reward (which also adds you know... content) instead of purchasable in an online store. Sigh. Regardless, today's patch was great!
---
I did read the damn patch notes thanks
---
idk if they got nerfed too but im only getting like 28 caps with lvl 3 hard bargain for max-plus condition assault rifles now, combat rifles and combat shotguns are getting me around 34-35
---
Yes. Maybe it will be a pet of the new dungeon that releases next week ..
---
Maybe it's my mods...but my trading was stuffed... couldn't see offered items...  Had to actually request the item.
---
Lvl 270 ish got a lvl 30
---
Just got it too!
---
You kid, but that pre-war money comes in droves and it makes for the perfect material to turn into gunpowder while setting up an acid farm at Hemlock Holes. It all goes into the bullet farming (sans bullet factory) I'm trying to do for these heavy weapons.
---
Same, level 30 gun.
---
The card to start the event is one time use.
---
After this patch there’s game stutter everywhere smh
---
I thought the stash ignored weight reduction perks?
---
Is fo76 good now?
---
Good job! 🤙
---
after the update.... I've had 6 runs and seen 0 legendaries....
---
I got excited for the bunny thinking it was a costume, then realized it was decor. Still pumped with all the CAMP stuff. I need all of it.
---
I’m not new no, but recently I’ve been seeing a lot of people on pc wear it and was just curious if people on Xbox were able to get it also
---
I got a unyielding leather arm off him. The reward was a mascot suit of him
---
Props, I would have remembered eventually but it is something super easy to do not to mention my low level alts that were just hat factories could probably be easily leveled to be able to handle the miners in Welch. I think my lowest alt is lvl 9, what level are those guys down there like 20? 
---
Eh, I will probably just find something else for them to craft daily while buying matts off the market to be honest, LOL. I am a lazy gamer and I am honest about it because I like being a lazy gamer. My 4 alts were making 1100c a day each for less than 10 min of work I just need to find out how they can make at least that much still from the same 10 minuets and it should not be hard considering the vendors have 200 more caps.
---
We still need an increase in how much Flamer Fuel you can craft with materials. At the moment the Fuel you get in return from crafting (even with Ammosmith and Super Duper) is absurdly low.
---
Well, that's a good (if not roundabout) fix.
---
YES!
---
Watoga RR has it, too. It was 1900 with level 3 Hard Bargain, 2200 regular price.
---
White wolf fedora for me
---
Xbox bro
---
I'm loving that this new event has pretty much crushed my bloodied character, which has been breezing through the majority of the game. I'm sure with enough trial and error I'll be able to figure out what's a better set up to this event than just smashing my face into it with everyone else.
---
WHY THE FUCK DID THEY DO THIS THEN HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO GET ANY CAPS NOW WITHOUT GETTING AN EXTREMELY LUCKY DROP LEGENDARY
---
lvl 232 here, also a little sad about the lvl 30 gun.
---
You have to buy a key card from any vendor
---
What gun?
---
Ah and they just straight up cost caps. Yeahh... that's not worth it for a single 3 star legendary.
---
Hard bargain, grape mentats and high charisma I get them for 1750
---
SAME.
---
Pros: 
---
- Much more stable servers.
---
- Adventure mode is your game lobby to prepare your gear and home for the pvp in Survival mode. (And yes prepare your home to be demolished by pvp)
---
Cons:
---
- The initial exploration joy you got at launch wears out the moment you start having equipment and junk routine runs across the same places on the map. It becomes a routine rather than an exploration expedition.
---
- Super Epic Out of this world weapon and bosses still look no different from low level stuff. The itch to read what makes this similar looking legendary gun different from that one is a bore.
---
- You may want to play fallout 4 for the stuff that's missing in F76.
---
To name a few.
---
So y’all got to the “pylon ambush site” checked the terminal and nothing?
---
This is what happened to me so I’m just verifying it’s not bugged.....no actual fight?
---
Thanks, I server hopped and then it worked.
---
See you joke but that kinda shit would be awesome
---
Right so I'm basically screwed I wonder who's idea it was to make the robots spawn constantly although the game is unstable as is whoever's idea needs firing tbh
---
Those what those were...I was wondering how eyebots were one shotting me
---
This is the first thing in game that’s actually killed me several times in a fight. We just failed my second attempt lol.
---
Well, I'm melee, so I didn't realize this. :)
---
All good
---
Hm weird, try restarting the game, they did say in the patch notes that they fixed those emotes in specific, weird that they dont show up
---
We tried server hopping. We could not get the event anywhere. Now people are sleeping and we will wait until tomorrow to hopefully try it out. :&lt;
---
Wow didn't expect it to be that drastic of a drop. Glad I sold a few last night.
---
Please don't let this be true. I just pimped out all of my Gatling Lasers and Gatling Plasma. Do you know if it is the same on Gatling Plasma?
---
Both are set to use Prime Receivers and the ammo just dying at 300 would make them useless because they are so expensive to keep cores.
---
sheepsquashed
---
What at camden gives rubber? Are there a lot of basketballs or life preservers I am missing?
---
It's always funny to see devs make such a drastic change (i.e. the caps switch). Makes you wonder what they were thinking in the first place to get something so wrong.
---
But yea, seems like another good patch overall. If they can avoid stepping in the cash shop pile of poop again, it should be a good spring. xD
---
Well boys... Now that it's nerfed, whats the next best thing? Get to work reddit detectives! I have faith you'll crack the case.
---
It is for the Excavator Power Armor
---
Same thing has happened to me twice
---
I do not feel this was entirely about listening but more about experimenting. Survival is a beta. They started out with ridiculous rewards in order to get people to try it. Now they went in the extreme opposite direction with very low rewards to see how players react. Those rewards are way too low as 25% of players level as caps fails to cover fast travel costs in getting to a fight.
---
I suspect the next update will be somewhere in the middle of both extremes.
---
There is a fight after the terminal is activated, if it was recently done it wont activate for a while
---
Unfortunately, this change was missed in our initial patch note creation process and was not intentionally hidden. We've updated the patch notes to include this in the balance section:
---
- **(Added April 9) Crafting:** Several craftable hats and outfits have had their crafting costs increased and Cap values decreased.
---
 - **Dev Note:** Previously, it was very easy to gain lots of caps by crafting and selling these items. We've made balance adjustments accordingly to prevent them from being exploited, without making them too difficult to craft. This was missed during our initial patch notes creation process.
---
I noticed that too. Also all of the weapon stats disappear.
---
Think of it this way. Wastelanders flooded vendors with metric tons of stupid overvalued hats. That massive supply overshot demand, causing values to drop significantly. Isn’t this basically how markets work anyway?  
---
;)
---
Can you send me a screenshot of the mask?
---
It's for the Excavator, don't think they have a jetpack for the Excavator just yet.  Seeing as it was intended for mining purposes, it probably won't have a jetpack I am thinking.
---
All factions share caps and all are at whitesprings, woo!! Renaming power armor, double woo!!!
---
Can confirm it does NOT count. Bummer and bullshit.
---
So I’ll need to come back later?
---
Hahaha I get it.
---
Updoot for the radstag named Vomit. 👍
---
Shouldn't get nerfed if people actually follow the instructions and &gt;!activate the pylons!!!!&lt;
---
Well that's a big clearly, looks like I'm holding off on running it on an alt till it's fixed. Damn, it looked soo cool,
---
Push to talk works great ;)
---
I just logged in, no extra vendors at WS..
---
I like your Reply xD
---
No, go away
---
Camden... Every Cup, HotDog Tray and Napkin... Usually nets a  good bit of cloth
---
I heard about this in one of Oxhorn's videos the other day. There's a story behind the minigun, but it was removed from the game. I've copy-pasted for you to the moment where he starts speaking about it if you want to see :) https://youtu.be/Ss2LY6eBwPU?t=623
---
You get a gun for completing a step of the new quest. Spoilers.
---
It's a black combat rifle with a tan mag and rail. It looks sick. It also makes you sneak faster and better
---
Yes, a couple of people have already noted that. This was a stupid redesign and was not tested really. It is so obvious.
---
Im stuck on this also
---
I found that moving the items I want to connect, closer to eachother and then i could connect them
---
Hmm sounds nice
---
That's a rip in the chat
---
The texture appears normal to me (PS4). Haven't noticed the zooming in thingy. I threw away my other binoculars though O.O
---
&gt;In regards to the time out:  if I've got 4 friends, I'll go and kill each one by one, then we line up again for person 2.  How long is this wait timer? 5 minutes? An hour? If it's short we can wait, maybe grab some crops or manage inventory.  If it's long it will nice to get if you do kill someone, but not reliable enough to provide a hunting incentive.
---
You also earn commendations for surviving and doing quests, challenges, leveling up, etc. Maybe even for clearing an area? These are general ideas. The point is to reward normal PvE activity while making PvP an optional thing that COULD result in a big reward, but also carries risk. I agree it would have to be balanced so that kill farming each other isn't a thing. The BEST thing to do would be to play normally, earning commendations, and if you see a player and have a tactical advantage - take them out for a nice boost to your commendations. You could of course also just hunt people, but there's more risk there.
---
Right across from the Slokems Joe on the road from Flatwoods
---
Same here (PC)
---
I believe it is one-time use. I could be wrong though.
---
You are correct. For some reason I thought I remembered that it was coming in May.
---
Well.
---
Maybe it'll show up now in those Workshop attacks? People were getting ones that said Sheepsquatch for a while before this update, but they had different enemies instead.
---
You unlock the recipe for the item, but you have the buy part of it from the vendors in whitesprings (not sure which one sorry). AFAIK it costs a lot, but maybe you could try server hopping to find a group doing it.
---
YUP
---
All the plans on the vendors show as not being learned for me. Hint: I know them. Plans laying out in the wild show up fine.
---
That's not the mechanic, lol. Pretty Sure you are supposed to switch who is taking the damage because it seems to increase as you stay as the conduit.
---
That’s what people told me when I warned them about what shark cards would do to gta online when it came out. Look at it now. All you have to do is see what will make them money by offering these things to predict how this will affect the game (badly). I refuse to support them making money in a way that their best option is to make the game balanced badly in order to get you to pay to fix the balance.
---
I hope not. I'll be loggingbon tonight and I'm hoping for a smooth game session. Also to kill Sheepsquach 😁
---
Reminds me of Indiana Jones’ rival from the intro section of The Last Crusade
---
Look in the trunk of the car on the top floor of the estate
---
The spoiler is in the title
---
Amazing compared to how bad it was before. It really isnt. Its a step up from awful. Its still in dire need of months of polish. 😐
---
On pc its  working fine though rather then sorting the known to the top its all just mixed together.
---
Same zero thus far. RIP Watoga farming runs. See you in another life friend.
---
You people find literally any reason to start nagging don't you.
---
It's honestly a mess to craft the Card to recall him I need a special circuit in a tinker bench that I'm guessing can be found on him after you kill it
---
In the same situation. I'm thinking it's this event that people are talking about. Still looking around and sever hopping, so will update if something happens.
---
Or maybe invest time in other aspects of the game besides just selling hats...
---
Where did you get the recall card. I'm pretty sure the quest is suppose to end with you starting the event and completing it. I accidentally did the event before the quest so I think I lost my card.
---
I will update the post main body with your info.
---
Molerat vulgaris and molerat dominator ;)
---
Event rewards?!?!??! What are those?!?!?!
---
There is bro. All my friends have the problem. Most of us aren’t gonna play. Literally unplayable and the more you play the more you stutter. Even I’m the damn menu
---
It can also be obtained via the new quests and event I think.
---
[Crystal gravy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0sjRG34DlA)....
---
Bummer
---
You do get it in game fool. It’s a possible reward from the new event. Research before jumping to conclusions.
---
Keep following the stream as it bends left, you'll eventually come across a cave near the other side of a small lake
---
Thank you very much!! :)
---
He blocked me in the bathroom and I had to shoot him to escape. I would rather have been insulted.
---
How did you get it? Event reward or event boss drop? Something else?
---
Someone before the war making the mask and us finding it?... IMPOSSIBLE
---
Did it fix the sudden and drastic nerfing I experienced over the past few weeks? After they nerfed firearms a while ago, I retooled myself around melee weapons... which now don't do shit.
---
The fixer. Lvl 30 indeed.. :(
---
It's triggered by an item you get from the quest for free, once per character. You have to buy additional items (heard someone found one on Grahm) to trigger it again.
---
i got the card after i completed the quest where you were in like the lab with the robot workbench. you got in from doing like the washing machine and dryer thing i think and it opened these big doors like from the mistress of mystery ones
---
Don't worry if you fail , seeing it's an event it seems to come up again on the map every so often . Just did it for my second time and passed this time . Got a white wolf fedora
---
No clue, must be I don’t know how you are meant to get it if not
---
Yes thank you!
---
As an avid power armor collector, you have no idea how happy this makes me
---
The quest is over, you have to use the card to start the event. It’s very very hard though. You need a large team of high levels to win.
---
I haven’t played on my main but when I tried to do trades on mules I could not go 5-10 sec without stuttering
---
They haven't been touched since that "10% buff" a few weeks back.
---
So no, most Energy Weapons are not practical still.
---
The Assaultron head DID have most, if not all, of it's bugs fixed though. It's definitely way better now.
---
Basketballs. And there's a place with a ton of life preservers
---
Yes they do. Many of them without actually knowing what they are talking about.
---
Thank you 
---
It told me to search an area away from the cave for some reason
---
Play the fucking game, for fucks sake. Its a reward item from the event.
---
How is that an exploit? They were the ones that created the cost and the value of the Hat people were just utilizing it.  Didn't Bethesda intend for people to sell the hats for caps? If so then it's not an exploit.
---
Look for complete brackets, like ()[]&lt;&gt;{}, those will eliminate fake passwords or reset the amount of tries you have.
---
I'm liking the Argus C3 skins. :)
---
Lol no. How about improving PvP by taking melee weapons off of melee players? Didn't think so.     
---
My build is a VATS build, learn to crouch...
---
It all stays. What you build mainly comes from the workshop build budget (components listed green) vs. out of your stash (components listed white).
---
You randomly guess word, and guess which letter you get correct, you can also find in the symbol “duds” which give you more lives
---
Dud example: []
---
Or : (-;:?.!3)
---
Even: {|&gt;~!,£\•}
---
But I feel that people will complain about how hard it is rather than figure out the best way to beat it. I could be wrong, but they did nerf the SBQ twice I think.
---
really? they didnt even notify me of this. huh.
---
But when modded to allow overlap that stuff looked great. I spent a lot of time placing things exactly using coordinates.
---
Quite and restarted, all good.
---
Same with camp damage in PvE :(
---
you are very welcome :) I checked out where I linked from now to confirm that I hit the nail on the head, but at that point he only mentions the minigun, it is later in that video he starts reading from the game's cut lore and an explanation presents itself. Sorry about that :P
---
I'm getting downvoated for saying that? :D :D :D :D :D
---
It’s really poorly done in my opinion. It is not clear what needs to be done next. A lot of people on here have been asking.
---
That or server hop :)
---
Damn, this is a really good patch. One of the first ones where I agreed with everything done. Losing half my aid and 400 caps on death was too much, thank you for this patch Beth.
---
I just stepped out to get dinner. It’s exactly the same as the one in store but it’s white.
---
 Thanks bro 👍🏼
---
Same. No matter what character. Even tried it on my brothers account. Same thing
---
So you pick a word as a first guess. If it has 1 likeness it means one of the letters is the correct one in the correct position. If it's 2 likeness it's two correct letters in the correct position etc ...
---
It's pretty fiuckin hard lol
---
Thank you 👍🏼
---
This is because Repair and Inspect(to rename an item) is the same button(Y). If you press X(Workbench Repair) it allows you to repair whatever it is that needs repairing. It is slightly bugged where all the text disappears but if you back out and then toggle to craft again it fixes it temporarily. You pretty much just have to "get used to it" until they fix it.
---
Wasn't there supposed to be a feature where we could display items in our stash....?
---
I believe all outfits go over armor. Try it on and check your pip boy.
---
Thanks man 👍🏼
---
how do you start the event?? im having the same issue
---
Apparel items go over your armour, you still wear it but the outfit will be what's visible to you and everyone else :)
---
i noticed it’s neither sorted by online status or alphabetical order now, it’s just a mess with names in a completely random order
---
I'm not on PS4, and no offense, but do people even reslly read AND understand these things? I never said I didn't want my cloth. I'm just wondering why they decided not to let us sell the prewar money. Like dishrags and toilet paper, its monetary value is the fact it scraps into a piece of cloth, so why can't we sell it directly to vendors without scrapping it like we can dishrags and toilet paper? I'm keeping my cloth. I know it can be bulked up and sold. That's not the point of the question.
---
Flagella? What even is this new technology you speak of. A mere atom in the cosmos is all I need...
---
Oh, that’s the mask for the mascot one. I got the outfit the assualtron was wearing.
---
Yeah I did that but didn’t activate the calendar. But thanks!
---
Wrong Sub M8
---
My heart was left in Agora. Narbash will always be my spirit animal.
---
Hopefully the Burrows will provide a hard challenge to, but mostly with endurance and hordes of incoming enemies.
---
The jukebox MUST play Songs from the previous fallout games!
---
Having it play songs the radio plays all the time will be boring!
---
This explains so much I thought I was going crazy.
---
I believe you use the computer. I only have done the event as it’s already started, and haven’t actually used my card. It’s super difficult and you only get one shot before you have to buy the card again and it’s expensive.
---
Maybe you are right, but I did not read that to mean it designates things to other people, but instead just for yourself.
---
It is based on the game Mastermind, you can try it out [here](http://www.webgamesonline.com/mastermind/)
---
They just need to have a tunnel to spotify or pandora; to specific channels, that is.
---
Yes and they should also make PvP turn based just like classic fallout or at least give us the option to press X if we dont want our death to count because "its not fair" or "I wasnt ready". Classic playground rules.
---
Likeness is the number of letter matches in the same position within the word
---
Ie
---
Fish
---
Dish
---
3 likeness
---
Grain
---
Plane 
---
0 likeness, even though they share letters
---
I had this same problem. Than you commented for your help!
---
Exactly, it's easily countered.
---
Where at plz, new to this
---
You buy the missing bit for about 2k from vendors in the misc tab
---
The power of the small brain is to powerfull if only playing the game was an option
---
True, but still makes no sense why we can't bulk them. I dunno, guess it's just me.
---
I'm not even seeing a known tag on vendors. So far I've checked 2 at Enclave and all at Whitesprings, and none that have plans are showing known after the patch.
---
There's  a ton that still need to be eliminated. With hard bargain, I think straight jackets sell for 43 caps a piece, and you can get.. what?  About four of them a day at Ft. Defiance? Exploit! Slash the rate of straight jacket spawns to one straight jacket once per week. 
---
People are able to craft 2000 rounds of 5mm of ammo because of super duper perk? Exploit!  Better reduce the proc chances to .01 percent with the perk maxed.
---
Before i 1st time completed cryptid event, i -personally- didnt beleave anything in PvE can even scratch my powerarmor while i'm fighting in close range with my vampiric super sledge. Ok - cryptid's -60% hp strikes convenced i was wrong. So, now i'm sure - in dungeons and raids it will be ass kicking fiesta, but - if they'll give us 4\* and 5\* legendaries (and some low chance for rare apparel) - it will be move in totally right direction for this game, which now have no real end-game content.
---
So please! PLEASE, guys - don't complain about the high difficulty - i think - this event is our chance to get proper end-game content in near future, but if it seems to Bethesda that people are not happy with the high difficulty - they could decide to make future content more player-friendly and i strongly suspect we'll get some like Fasnacht - easy and boring.
---
What event?
---
What power armor is the warrider skin for, and is there any chance it will be available for all?
---
is there an option in the computer? i only have the recall option but it doesnt do anything
---
You have to read one of the posters that Says Sheepsquatchs are my Brother. I believe they spawn at train stations
---
I mean if it really is that easy to get 150 rubber a day then it is a solid option to make the marine tac mask but it still seems like a lot of work.
---
i’ve done that and i’ve done every quest but no event
---
You’ll have to wait for someone who has done it to chime in, sorry! Check back at recent posts on this thread too.
---
What is it lacking or what bugs are you encountering?
---
Still these hats, just do a supply drop, they normally have 100 pre war money in them which breaks down into plenty of cloth to make those hats. You can easily farm the supply drop tapes in flatwoods and morgantown, just check the mailboxes, I normally find at least 3 between morgantown and flatwoods.
---
I’d be happy with a reliable way to get mods for it!  Add plans to the enclave events maybe. Server hopping got old fast!
---
ditto, this is fucked. I wonder if it's a mod/custom.ini thing? My friends list is fucked too
---
Used to have the same opinion, but criticals are necessary against high tier builds or gear. Without that pvp would become very one sided
---
I don't have Known at \*all\*.
---
Not songs over 100 years old? There are already are a few classical songs on the juke.
---
I get what you mean, but Grain and Plane both share the letter A in the 3rd spot
---
Improve PVP by removing it from the game so PVP people go and play a regular PVP game and everyone else can play Fallout 76 without PVP nerfs screwing PVE.
---
Thanks anyway. =D
---
Shot you a PM asking for account information so the dev team can investigate what might be causing this to occur for you.
---
It similar to the SBQ in that you need a keycard to do it, that is one time use. Just go to the computer and use and the event starts.
---
That's great, I can't wait. I'm tired of one hitting everything. There's basically no end game content for those of us over level 100.
---
Yeah dude it’s fun. I wasn’t expecting to go through that many stim packs though. I have grounded, scaly skin, and t51b and that face laser  still messes me up.
---
And after? How can I use this card for recall it?
---
The unfortunate part is missing out on strangers trying to communicate too
---
Exploiting an oversight is an exploit.  Get outta here with that "bUt ItS iN tHe GaMe" non logic
---
When you dye for some reason you can't use your stimpack and you got no pointer on the map to come back to life. So to play you have to restart your consul meaning you loose all your junk again. There's always some shot that goes on in this game
---
.
---
They are most likely going to be an Atom Shop release in the future.
---
I’ve had one on my character for months now. No practical purpose, just adds to my characters backstory
---
Doesn't always work. They seem to think it's impossible to land on that giant road through the Mire, for example. Probably some sort of terrain flag glitch.
---
I think the Xbox servers have gone down? My boyfriend and I couldn’t join servers and it just said ‘waiting’ in the menu
---
Thank you! Now I won't twitch whenever it pops up.
---
Around 15 players all level 100 or more. It was a shitstorm. And then when the thing finally died nobody knew where it went because it flew into the stratosphere. No reward pretty sad
---
Anyone try streaming the spotify app on xbox during fo76? Is it not very relaible? I saw spotify has bad ratings
---
How is it an oversight your Honestly just salty for no reason it's been in the game for months
---
I saw this when I was rebuilding my C.A.M.P. on Xbox a couple of weeks ago. I got really excited but remembered that I hadn't seen it in the Atomic Shop (I check it daily) and sure enough, it wasn't there. I was so tempted to buy it but I'm glad I didn't because when I saw that it wasn't in the shop I was like, "That's just gonna eat my coins." so to speak or in this case, my atoms.
---
Is this for Survival Mode? 🤔
---
no, I can't see it! Cause main chars rised at  adventure mode have to stay there... Survival mode should have be a whole new thing.
---
I gathered that, (sorry if i sound offending) but whenever i click the recall option its just says "recall aborted" i do have the recall keycard. Is there a specific way to use it?
---
I SEE IT! Ty,
---
If you are refering to the new event with the boss you gotto use workbench to craft the key and use it at the terminal. Vendors sell the part needed for i think 2000 caps (if i remember right). And you need one stable fluorecent flux (again if i remember right).
---
Man, I did it and I died 6 or more times, and wasnt worth it. But thats my opinion and I couldn't even tell you what i got from it.  Oh except i went through a shit ton of stimpacks. Hope you have a better time.
---
Congrats man! It only gets easier from here. I'm a melee, level 120, and I can two shot those things just as soon as they land...annnnny day now.
---
Dude let players dj...I feel like the community is chill enough to responsibly handle it...maybe not Xbox or PS4...but PC is tots chill
---
Unless it's the bugged tattered rags costume.
---
That’s abuse.
---
i think its on a timer? i just finished the quest and cant spawn event. Maybe you have to wait an hour or longer before you can do it. Only did the event once so far
---
Everything looks amazing
---
imo legendaries shouldn't be gauranteed to begin with. If I go to McDonald's they don't always have a Big Mac in stock at that time...
---
Yeah the patchnotes say that only the player who set the name can see the name, so no matter if they drop it, sell it or trade it to you, you won't see the name.
---
Did you get it from the event itself or did you have to loot the assaultron. Because when I did it is Ultron went into the stratosphere no one could load it. I got nothing from the event itself is pretty sad
---
NP ^_^ Glad I could help!
---
Ugh... totally missed that one.  Still waiting...
---
The one time He's spawned for me I thought he was an enemy in the event I was doing and shot him. :(
---
I use ~ which looks nice and puts my goodies at the bottom of the list, although it's a bit annoying in non-Survival mode due to that key being bound to the console. But I still do it anyways (and mostly play Survival now anyways where it does nothing, what with the whole no-console thing and me never actually having used third party mods).
---
I'm level 59 and I've been playing on a single character since the BETA to give you an idea of how much I get to play. I think what frustrates me is that with how rocky the rollout has been it seems like Bethesda is more concerned with nerfing loopholes than fixing the underlying problem with stash size/inventory management.  It might just be that this game isnt a great fit for me, but Ive enjoyed big parts of it and love the franchise as a whole. I appreciate the insight,  and I'll likely come back to 76 after a while and take your advice into consideration.
---
Yeah I’m getting that now after we just failed. Assume you have to wait a bit on the server between attempts.
---
The Atomic Shop only gives you the black variant. The normal one is an event reward for Encrypted.
---
Not ingame yet, think they might have been pioneer patch don't remmber what the esm said
---
You got 5 in 450h? I remember only 1, also in around 450h. Besides the north, the fo76 wasteland is not a wasteland. Remember the glowing sea in fallout 4? This is what i call wasteland :)
---
Death inducing at times!
---
Very true. Fans are pissed but sales are better than ever. Hey, we should do the right thing still. Said no one ever.
---
Event reward, assultron had regular assultron loot plus a legendary on it
---
if you re on Ps i can give you plans\\recipes masks and the beret. Yes it will be yearly I think
---
Using decryptors online. You don’t even need to get the codes in game.
---
It's quite a bit less buggy than it was at launch, but it's still "Bethesda buggy" with minor inconveniences here and there. 
---
The story is a lot more subtle and slower paced than previous games as it is mostly told through the environment, holotapes, and terminals. I argue that isn't as boring as it sounds though as you play the role of someone leaving the vault after the entire region's inhabitants have died off. You are essentially playing detective to try and figure out what happened and how to make Appalachia liveable again. While there isn't much in the way of characters to identify with in the story, it's still very interesting from a Fallout world-building point of view. If you've ever just been a fan of the history and "what-ifs" that go into Fallout games, then there is a lot to discover here.
---
There are a TON of unique locations to explore as well, although unlike past Fallout games they don't all come with a quest or lore. Some are just areas to find scrap, or workshops to activate for valuable materials (think an abandoned power plant that makes fusion cores if you spend the 30 minutes to repair different areas of it). That said, getting into your own niche of maintaining resources (both to survive and kill) can be very rewarding and immersive with all of the extra emphasis on these things that hasn't been in previous Fallout games.
---
If that still appeals to you, then yes, the game is worth playing. If you only liked Fallout for its RPG writing depth/sidequests (chances to affect the plot and characters) then you probably won't like it.
---
 This is all awesome. I have to ask though, now that the railway rifle's been fixed, can all the Vfast melee weapons be next? I really wanna run around with a level 50 legendary chainsaw that's affected by my melee weapon perks.
---
Only way I've found to get a key card is to buy it from a vendor. Other ways might pop up once people explore more, but for right now that is the most known way. 
---
And hell yeah that event is hard, at least 3 people needed and that thing one shot so many people.
---
I haven't been on since last week, I'll give it a go tonight.
---
Yet the problem would still exist in survival as players increase in level beyond the cap.
---
Again I say:  For fuck's sake, Bethesda.
---
For what particularly?
---
Seen people on xbox with it, no idea how they got it though =/
---
Same here on xbox
---
You can also get it from a vendor at Whitesprings.
---
It's an event, can only be done once so often. Just server hop and you'll eventually get it.
---
Is your guy jumping when trying to attach a wire?
---
It's like the worst combat-wise but the utility is outstanding. I keep using it for the utility alone.
---
If any game should have proud casuals playing it, it's fo76, enjoy it!
---
Or at least fix them so if you turn them off in one game session that they are still off in the next. I have a jukebox and radio near each other and its always fun to hear them clashing when I log on
---
You go to the terminal at the shack where all the pylons are (quest leads you there), bottom option should be to recall it.
---
It said that for me to. Give it a couple hours then check back.
---
Its the best it adds 100 carry weight with all the pieces and you can add another 100 with calibrated shocks on both legs
---
What's wrong with the Excavator armor in the first place?
---
Would you say it’s good for just exploring around and wandering etc..
---
Even the scorch beast queen and glowing ones! I want those!
---
I've got an image of it in my mind, but I don't think I can really see myself in that.
---
It has one of the worst damage resistance compared to T-45, T-51b and T-60 power armor however when all pieces are used you gain 100+ in carry weight which is a nice perk .
---
Utility is fantastic. Just carry more stimpaks and radaway to offset the reduced protection compared to t51/x01/ultracite.
---
Welp time to kill my pet again and tear down a couple of things so I can build these
---
they're not forced to do survival mode aka [PvP server] -let me quote some people: "where the bad player has to be banned"... but wait... never mind!
---
It's an assaultron dressed up as a sheep
---
Didn’t even know they existed!
---
Well that's good news at least I just had a bad RNG roll
---
People just tell me it’s really bad so I was wondering
---
how come?
---
Just went through this, for some odd reason I had to free up like 80 something
---
Personally i dislike that they change little things that we were used to, like an extra confirmation button for repair or using E to access our stash instead of R as usual.
---
I just like the way it looks and it's been part of my character for a while.  Kind of wish it didn't have that red glow though, because the perfectly round light looks weird.
---
I had one for a period. Some random gave it to me. Than they started messaging me about how they own me now. I thought this is dumb but went along with it. Id carry his stuff and just run his quests for him. I found out he gave out the collars to alot of other people which made me jealous but than last week he gave me a wedding ring in game. So were getting married in August. Idk how to tell my family that im getting married to a guy. Theyll probably just give me grief about using a female avatar and say see this is what you get while looking at me with that look, that one that says we always knew but hoped it wasnt true.
---
Yeah. Full set increases your carry weight by 100 and you mine better. So it's a great set for hoarding loot etc.
---
You probably saw the combat helmet with gas mask. I did that
---
If you watch the news, there are a ton of awful things on the verge of happening every day.  
---
In fallout, those awful things have already all happened.  
---
There's something soothing about not waiting for the other shoe to drop.
---
Sure it is. For now. But you know just as well as i do that if you give a hand, they'll take an arm. If the gameindustry has shown us one thing in the last years, it's that they won't stop there. 
---
Sure now it's just repair kits, and i don't care much about those. But they DO have an in-game effect. So if we let this slide they can always call upon that when the next thing comes. Now it's repair kits. But they already mentioned other things in the newspost. Things like items that give you access to your stash whereever you are, or fridges that make your food not spoil, among others.
---
And THOSE absolutely do have an impact, especially the "Stash anywhere" one. 
---
You always gotta look where it leads us. Today it's just a very slight boon, not having to farm for repair mats, but tomorrow you have a stash anywhere, and the day after they might start selling weapons or perks flatout. And i don't want that to be happening. Bethesda is walking on very thin ice with Fallout76. And right now they seem to be on a very good course, so i'd hate to see them break in after all.
---
The only person I care to play with is my husband, and I can yell to him in the next room.
---
Yeah if I have to delete 80 gigs im just not going to play.
---
It says to check later for recall, I think there's a timer on it? But I did the event by other guy activated it and when was my turn to call the mission ended without say nothing
---
Thanks a lot, I might just make a full set of it now haha
---
Why in your country you quote by ,,quote,, 
---
Why in english we quote with "quote"
---
Why in my country we quote with ,,quote"
---
Because world is big :)
---
I am from the future and can confirm that Fallout 76 ended service when BethesdaEnix released Skyrim 76.
---
Skyrim 76 does have a similar event called FusRohNacht. Entry costs 1800 dragon souls from the Elder Scrolls Shop, though.
---
You know what, changes like this would not even make people mad if you would remove the personal caps limit and add unlimited caps to vendors. 
---
It would make life easier if I could just sell everything I find when I play for caps but the way the system works now the max weight limit makes it so I cant save items on my person or stash, I can't sell them all, and I have to drop them or break them down to almost worthless scrap components that still weigh me down. 
---
This is all a veiled strategy hiding behind the guise or the idea of balance because you want people to log in daily. Don't worry we will find a way around it or stop playing all together. Then the game dies and we all lose.
---
I love this thread because I'm also a frequent donator of items.  I like building settlements so I get a lot of extra plans, and then I just bombard someone, the lowest level I can find.  And I totally agree we need an emote for "I want to give you free shit"
---
Not true in 100% of cases. If I lock on to you while you're standing then you crouch, I can still VATS you for a moment. I also have the standard Tesla Rifle defense for Stealth Boys and an Anti Armor Handmade for when Players try to close the gap. For context I'm a VATS Sniper with Sent/Ass and I only stand when Players get too close. Sort of a hybrid style I guess
---
If it’s not gonna drop a legendary regardless of star level then it should be named as legendary. Mind you, it ain’t the first time something has been said/advertised in this game which ain’t exactly true.
---
You prob only need that extra 8 as it says, try a game you dont play as much, it wont delete the save data just the download, not the worst
---
Right.  I know you can find them online but how are they being determined.  Someone must be posting them online.  How are they figuring them out without even knowing the cypher?
---
Yes. Price reduced and material cost to craft raised on those.
---
I feel you. I'm over 200 and it's since 180 that i do a new character almost daily,because it's simply that faster,even for the level up while intoxicated.
---
A single level up is already quite hard unless i just server hop west tek. With a new character you get 3 in 15 minutes.
---
I do the same with the BoS rifle as well. Never thought of adding bobby pins too. Will have to add some as I have over 300. Every time I see them, I pick them up.
---
Yeah. I use mine whenever I get over encumbered. Drag all my loot to a workbench.
---
Nah man, I'm Level 93 and I just finished the quest yesterday and got it, it's great fun! Granted not as good when you've got multiple enemies to take out, but it can kill a charred feral ghoul in 5 hits with no perks. So I'm excited to see more Incendiary legendaries
---
My biggest issue with it is the wasted keys. The lead up (yes I read everything) did not make it clear you would need a whole group. It said it would be tough for a person not that a group would be necessary.  So I wasted my key and I hear it will cost 4200 caps to craft another. I still put up a fight until the game lagged so hard it crashed (xbone). 
---
Also, the ridiculous amount of the highest armor piercing dudes in the game make armor worthless. May as well fight naked and avoid the repairs.
---
There's the extra carryweight it has. Normally 100 extra units, but then you add calibrated shocks to the legs, and add 50 units per leg. And then there's the unexpected extra 100 carryweight when you login to the game already in the excavator set. Unarmored carryweight  is about 280, in armor with a new login, 566. So if hauling stuff is your deal, then excavator is your best friend
---
Dont think so, I've do that with the gas mask and medical goggles as well.
---
I have one because my friend gave it to me and I just never took it off he has one too
---
Got ya I think
---
ok now i see it but then then a lvl cap is more reasonable then take player their reward.
---
But it the bethesda way...
---
I have the exact same issue with challenges. I captured a workshop after midnight, and I know I previously completed those three weeklies the last time they showed up. I submitted a ticket and I suggest you do as well.
---
Came here to find answers. I never recieved the card, have the recipe, but it requires me to have an old (assuming already used) one.
---
I wouldn't know sorry
---
I think PVP should be an entirely separate mode.   Remove workshop PVP from adventure mode. No contesting.  Don't like it? Go play survival.
---
You didn't read the patch notes, did you? There's a poster at Lewisburg trainstation (possibly others) that you haffta read to start it and it's being given away free in thr Atomic Shop. You can buy it, read it, and it starts the questline.
---
Finally something hard lmao
---
for one, more chances to buy the junk you need lol
---
Check the terminal in the hidden room again, his location is there. You will "download coordinates"
---
[Yup, same bug as I've found](https://i.imgur.com/e9CJGon.jpg).
---
Thanks anyway, let's see!
---
Had no idea about these myself. Where did you get the plans?
---
Nice! Now I won't have to dc when little jimmy comes running in front of my shots with his power armor and all rise
---
I think people are dying to the exploding eyebots and the stealthed assultron. But I can agree on the crashing and lag problems!
---
I'm wondering the same. All I can think of is that it'll be easier to buy bulks of stuff and plans/recipes without having to server-hop. But that's my best theory :P
---
What kind of screwed-up McDonald's are you going to?
---
It's so weird to me how much PVP divides people in this game. I love traditional fallout but I think it would be a total wasted opportunity to have online fallout as co op PVE game.
---
He’s talking about the event.  Not the quests
---
I feel like this happens when they update but eventually they come back. Ive seen it happen in white springs.
---
What are you supposed to do in the event? I see you can activate a pylon and then it names you as a conduit. Do you do anything after that? I know there may be instruction text but I'm having trouble reading it.
---
Should I talk to her about it? She never replies. My friends have tried too but no reply from her. Very heartbreaking.
---
Im not having issues on PC however the quest for the sasquatch dlc has vanished and it wont let me progress any further
---
Yeah, I guess that makes sense. Lols
---
They hacked the game code.  It's cheating.  But crowd mentality has rationalized that it's ok, so they'll defend it to the ends of the Earth.  I have a lot more fun doing it legitimately.
---
RIght. Repair Kits themselves aren't the problem. It's the notion that they already have "More ideas" to "try something new with the Atom Shop" as they put it. Their last post even directly mentions fridges that keep stuff from spoiling and an item that allows you to access your stash from anywhere. And that definitely is where i draw the line. But by that point the "It shouldn't give you an advantage" and the "You promised, only cosmetics" are no longer valid because the repair kits already do that. Sure the advantage is miniscule, but it's there.
---
You didn’t read their question did you? He said EVENT.
---
I can finally hear BIV!
---
Assuming so that people dont say that it doesnt make sense to have a shared cap pool if theyre not all together in one place lmao
---
You don't have to level up three times. If you put on a responder uniform, faschnaut mask, and are above 76 (or meet a third criteria) you will get it in one level up.
---
Any clue as to which vendor sells such things? Thanks!
---
I'm going to miss insult bot 1.0. He was like the annoying kid brother always ttying to tag a long that I never had.
---
I've even made a post about it seeing if anyone else had found the entrance. It bugs the hell out of me.
---
I had the same issue, had to hastily log out without completing the quest - real life happens - and upon logging in quest log had that entry and no marker.
---
Went to the terminal, clicked the 'download the coordinates' entry again and the quest started 'moving'.
---
If this doesn't work for you try 'server hopping'.
---
No there's an actual quest you need to do as well
---
I'm starting to think that the xbox servers are at max capacity at the moment, with a new quest being dropped. Which sucks on my end as I dont get a lot of time to play during the week.
---
LOL
---
They pushed it to the next patch. Sounds like they found a few issues.
---
I'm on Xbox as well wonder if it's spesific
---
lol the one that happens to be right next to Bethesda HQ apparently
---
Same here. Playing on PC with a controller and when i inspect my gear there is no repair prompt. I have to disable the controller in the game settings to get the option to repair. Kind of a bummer...
---
Sameeeeee
---
I had a toxic sniper kill me the other day. I took over the workshop at Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm. I usually take it over, and then put signs out saying free food. I went into Flatwoods to give all my extra junk away, and leave ammo I don't use in the Overseer's stash. I saw 3 low level characters all 'hiding' which I thought was weird. They were just walking around hidden to avoid being on the map I guessed.
---
I jumped on top of a roof and was going to take a bathroom break. I saw a guy come into town lvl 90 towards me with his gun out. He went hidden and one shot killed me. At the same time someone else was claiming my ownership of the workshop. I was just going to let them have it. I just take it to turn on the machine and make food. I have no need for it actually. I thought it may have been a coordinated effort to kill me and take the workshop. I re-spawned and went to hidden on another roof. I watched as the guy who took the workshop gets killed. Then the guy who claimed my workshop re-appears in Hemlock Holes Maintenance. He claims that workshop and then goes hidden.
---
So here are my observations. The guy who killed me is going around and one shot killing high level players to get caps since they can initiate PVP instantly since I claimed a workshop. That is clever and shitty. I don't know if the PVP change on caps works on adventure mode, but it would make "farming" high level characters who are being nice less attractive. However it does not replace the fact that you can do that. Second, the guy who was taking over my workshop got farmed too. He was a high level player. I think he was hoping I would engage in PVP to counter his claim. I have no interest. You want it... take it. However, I can see he got killed too. If you take a workshop, then it appears you need to remain hidden on the map and sneak unless you want to be hunted for caps. You also need to be wary of "workshop campers" who will hide and wait for you to return to get your resources, or defend the workshop.
---
I would really like adventure mode to not have PVP on workshops. You should be able "claim" it to make it functional like making food or fusion cores, but then it should be simply defending it. The resources should be shared (first come first serve)  with no locks on them. It would make for better collaboration, and remove the last barrier for griefing in adventure mode.
---
No it's great, also +200 weight.
---
i saw a post on here the other day saying it got pushed back :T
---
I got the in-game sheep mascot hat!  
---
[https://imgur.com/xs0wPFV](https://imgur.com/xs0wPFV)
---
I am considering just adding an "a" or "1" to all my stuff so it sorts itself to the top of my inventory.
---
At 15c each you still need what like 93 leather a day, are you gonna farm the cow spawns in flatwoods or hunt the all the toy bear spawns in Camden? What is you play to get all the leather?
---
I like the way they look, but from a practical standpoint, I could see myself tripping on them quite often.
---
Scammer
---
Car bumper
---
Ik it sucks dude. Give it half hour and they will probably be ok
---
How about...the known ones go to the bottom. I'm tired of scrolling through all the known plans to see if there's one rare one that I don't know. Phoenix is the worst when you're trying to learn all the PA mod plans.
---
I'll throw in my preferred "tactic" that I used in Fallout4: call everything you want to keep Z Something-something. Like "Z Right Leg", "Z Melee" and so on :P but "CURRENT" is also very hard to overlook heh so I'll throw an upvote your way hoping to make your post more visible (Y)
---
Its super cereal
---
so half a dozen people's opinion means objective fact? nope
---
Only 75 more for some atoms
---
That works too.
---
They might do like they did with the nukashine quest  and the entrance may be those buildings just in front of the sound.
---
I know the buildings for the frat houses existed in game but they were boarded up and had no way in.
---
After nukashine dropped they became loading screen doors.
---
So the burrows questline might be similar.
---
Pretty sure all of them sell it, just head to whitesprings and check all the new vendor bots. That's where I got my second one.
---
maybe maybe not
---
One place to sell.  Plus you should get more caps back from bigger purchased.
---
Yea I’m on XB1 so what the hell can you do!? This is a MAJOR problem!
---
ok ok, this idea has a lot of merit. You find sheet music, and learn it like a note, but  then it plays through the radio, jukebox or pipboy.
---
fallout 3 and new vegas mirelurk kings that look more like actual turtles with a shell
---
Word. Appreciated.
---
Ah good so you can go on those whitespring runs. I've been playing since launch, but took a break for a couple months or so to finish other games, and rn I'm more addicted than ever. I'm only level 72 but going up quick with routine trips to whitesprings and blast zones. My inventory is also constantly full but I'm slowly unloading it and keeping aid and junk to a minimum. Also gunpowder takes up more than you can realise. 
---
Unfortunately there are limits to how big the stash size can be due to the server stability issue, but maybe we'll get a small increase again. I think with things like the upcoming player vending it'll also help us move some more stuff out and get those all important caps flowing. 
---
As for playing the game, we don't have to be the best/richest to have a good time. Take your break and come back refreshed. Appalachia will be there still. I only launched my first nuke last week, so go at your own pace. Only in survival would you need more keeping up with the joneses. 
---
Anyways glad this was a positive convo and glad if I helped in any way. Have a good one :)
---
So that all of the plans that are spread out among the various factions won't require you to bounce all over looking for.
---
I didn’t know there was extra carry weight through a new login? How does that work?
---
* Is it just me or is this build insanely buggy? Took several attempts to get past the press a button screen.
---
* Lost audio.
---
* Quests missing (server hop didn’t fix)
---
* my first two ever crash to desktops.
---
* Mobs being invisible and hitting me
---
* Mobs floating in a default pose and seemingly melee me from several meters away.
---
That’s all in 3 hours.
---
I’m reinstalling over nigh and will see how it goes.
---
Thanks so much I feel like an idiot
---
Loved it
---
I'm guessing you weren't in pacifist mode?
---
WOKE
---
You get some set ones through the side quests and I can imagine all the others through the new event
---
Np fam.
---
New Event? What's it called, where's it take place at..?
---
Had the same on PC when I tried to trigger it myself (previously joined someone else's).
---
Educated guess: the event is on cooldown
---
Sadly I have been trying for little over an hour
---
I quote „“ too, title is a mistake.
---
Can confirm. I got the hat from the event and it's more of a grey color.
---
As if work wasnt punching me in the face enough today.... now you gotta go and be the messenger punching me in the gut? Lol 
---
Sad to hear I missed that one. Missed the power armor station with the flame decals too.
---
Explosions everywhere. Stealth robots and my favorite, being the conduit drains your hp really fast. All in all a great event 👌
---
Do you need to do the event to complete the quest
---
Really? Do you check it after you complete the event? Cause nothing showed up after I cleared the event for the first time.
---
gt is soureststraws, lets talk there
---
Dont feel bad, took 45 mins myself the diamond icon wont show up until i had to relog.
---
the event happened earlier before i got to that part, so i couldnt use my keycard.. and there were only 4 of us and we got our ass kicked. too many robots
---
Which masks are the rare ones? I’m holding all of mine in the hope to sell em when. Vending machines are a thing.
---
&gt; **Food:** The rate at which Food spoils is now more consistent. 
---
What the hell does this mean? Does it mean than food spoilage rates have been returned to pre-bugged states?
---
What's the bottom line? Is food spoilage on average faster than it use to be or not?
---
I haven't seen a single radstorm since BETA.  I honestly thought that they were removed.
---
I use it to quadruple mining yields for making ammo and getting rid of encumbrance so I can fast travel to base.
---
Let me know how your test goes but there is a user in here I added to the main post body that says he can confirm that yellow names are not hostile and can not be targeted. If it turns out he is trolling that will suck so let me know how your test goes.
---
Sorry bro, cant fix things like that anymore. Just pay 20 bucks for some atoms and buy a repair kit 😎
---
The biggest pro for me so far is the players. The community in general is so damn friendly. People will almost always be up for dropping some stuff to help out lower level players. The world is amazing and of say very well put together. It's gonna be different to the other games in the series but they said that from the start. If you don't like reading or holotapes then you're gonna have trouble with that. A huge amount of the bugs have been fixed and it's really stable these days. Even of you just play to explore the locations, id say it's worth it. If you're on PS4 I'd be happy to tag along and see if you get along well with the game
---
I've done everything from that quest line (the one main and the 4 side quests) and no. Also the purple vault wasn't included. Maybe i missed something but as it looks, no.
---
Here: https://youtu.be/_VE0-sA4WMM
---
I have to put my hand up, I don't know.
---
I had to log out again before I could look more into the matter.
---
I really don’t think it’s as simple as you say.  
---
I understand a promise was made regarding the atomic shop.  I agree with your fact.
---
Another fact is Fallout 76 has not sold as well as Bethesda planned for.  
---
How do you propose Bethesda makes more money from FO76?  By doubling down on their investment and fixing all of the game’s issues while releasing new player-approved content?  That sounds like a great idea, but how realistic is it?
---
Without supplementing their revenue somehow, the double-down idea is risky.  
---
Again, I’d prefer Bethesda announced paid DLC or a subscription, but players would complain about that, too.  Ultimately, Bethesda will do what they will; sometimes, plans have to change and promises need to be broken; hopefully that doesn’t mean pulling the plug on this game after a couple of years.
---
Omg all the Easter and pastels. My camp bout to be kawaii af!
---
If you take over a workshop, it is instantly PvP. If you have pacifist mode on, then you screw yourself if someone engages you in PVP. It means they do full damage and you do NO damage.
---
I was in pacifist mode.
---
It is next week. They're just giving a heads up about it probably being difficult
---
No the quest isn't even on my ledger anymore, it was just a guess I guess not than
---
It's been bugged since beta. Kinda hope it never gets fixed eh? My guess about the bonus carryweight is a little coding snafu that checks to see if you have excavator on, and gives you 100 extra, even though it already has the 100 already present.
---
Scorched earth always give a 2 star heavy combat armor piece one of the best endgame sets if you do not care about mixing and matching.
---
Can't replicate.
---
Where can we find the death claw one
---
Someone posted on Reddit that you could find the mod for this in watoga at the bos vendor but I'm not for sure if it is true. I wish it is because I scrapped the lobbing expecting to get the mod to mod my other guns. But I want to equipt to one of my bloodies and see what it could do
---
Now just...
---
I just read that it was delayed until May... so what about all the people (including myself) that maxed out their stash space to sell in their vending station..? Now I have to drop a whole bunch of stuff I should be making caps off of or I can not play the game until May when I can get rid of my junk..?👌🏼 I would rather have the buggiest vending system in the game that works 1/20 times &amp; be able to get rid of this stuff than have nothing &amp; now face a tough choice here. I just wish they’d work better at this, update today was overall good (brought back a lot of issues &amp; bugs again like every update) but player vending is what sold us on this update &amp; I feel a little disrespected to get finally to the update just to find out I’m screwed.
---
Well, that's fucking awful lmao. At least with the Queen all you lose is time launching a nuke. They should at least give us a way of triggering the event without requiring two+ days of full vendor cap.
---
the metal pile will appear wherever they died if you wait a minute or so.
---
It seems with the pylons, you just need three players to activate each pylon, then they become a conduit. If there are three conduits, then the boss loses its stealth. If a player dies while they are a conduit, then someone will have to activate their respective pylon again.
---
Doesn't matter what mode
---
I died quite a few times but granted, im level 35. Is it normal to respawn nearby in like 3 seconds? Only once i got the nornal respawn animation
---
&gt;so half a dozen people's opinion means objective fact? nope
---
Compared to just your single opinion? Yeah means a lot more than your incorrect definition.
---
&gt;your entire argument based on the assumption that the only way to get these things is with real money and that's just not true
---
Your entire argument is you can make a new character to farm atoms, yet you don't even realize atom rewards for completing challenges is tied to accounts not characters. 
---
So the fact you are so ignorant of this game to not even realize that you can't farm atoms by making a new character shows how little you understand about this game.
---
But hey, by all means keep showing off how ignorant of the game you are though with these comments. You are amusing me though with how ignorant you are of this game while trying to act like you know what you are talking about. LOL
---
They need to fix the mods for it first. Still not named properly and others can't even be applied to this day.
---
Sooooo the Defend the monongah power plant yard event in Flatwoods?? Lol
---
I think that’s it. It ends there
---
... in other words, just pretend you're still at the Fasnacht parade sporting a German accent
---
It's a mix of their questionable actions with past titles and decisions that they've tried to push that have earned them backlash when they get called out on it. If they're continuing the practice of trying to slowly push ideas that can make them more money that they know are questionable then it becomes harder to trust them on their words and actions. When they make a statement about having just cosmetics on a store but then suddenly they're bringing in items for "convenience" it's going to get backlash. The whole reason that "convenience" is needed in the first place is because they implemented requiring repairs into the system.
---
Sure there were repairs in FO3, FONV, Morrowind, and Oblivion. Once we got to Skyrim and FO4 though the repair system just disappeared in order to make it more "convenient" for newer players. "Enjoy your adventures, you can craft to your hearts content, don't worry about having to fix up the tools you use."
---
However, right when we get to a multiplayer game that can introduce microtransactions for a steady wave of purchases, the repair system is brought back, why? Would it not be more enjoyable for people to be able to play with their friends while not having to worry about stopping to dedicate resources to repairing all that gear? Why not have the system exist so players only stop when they want to use those resources to craft food, items, or to build up their CAMP? 
---
For most players, sure it's not a problem. We know where to go to farm resources along with how to handle our gear, builds, and combat situations so we can put that concern to a minimum. What about those outside of that group though?Players that might just have ended up spending their earned atoms on cosmetic items but now they're out or don't have enough for a repair kit. 
---
They're in a situation where they need to repair but don't have the resources and they can't really put in the time to go get everything because of say a timed event. "Well just pop onto the Atom Shop and pull out your credit card. It's only for your convenience after all." 
---
It slightly borders on becoming a predatory microtransaction. Trading any sort of situation where the player might have to put in time and work for "convenience" that can be exchanged for real currency is not really a good thing. Under the reasoning of, "Oh, it's just for convenience." Bethesda can just keep adding items that look questionable and get away with it.
---
I want to trust Bethesda, I want Fallout 76 to be a great game, I still play it and I'm looking forward what they can bring out content wise. I want to trust them but it's getting harder to keep that sort of trust when they keep making decisions like this. I don't entirely mind the repair kits, it's just when greed has the potential to set in it worries me a bit. Do you see my point?
---
I'M GONNA BE THE EASTER BUNNY!!!
---
Ohhhh I get you now, and hm I heard it was double but I’m probably wrong haha, I’ll have to google that 😅
---
I'm not sure anymore. People are saying that everything hasn't been released yet. So might have to wait for a week or 2. I did go back to the terminal and nothing new showed up. :(
---
2 star though. You can get better combat armor in other places. He’s saying he doesn’t want Scout armor to be able to drop from enemies.
---
If it were self-explanatory I don't think so many people would necessarily be having issues. I joined the event in progress and saw a charged pylon and lost all of my health immediately. That's not exactly something I expect to face immediately upon arrival at an event in a low level area. Things that definitely made this confusing:   
---
1) Exploding homing Eyebots (New Mechanic)  
---
2) Level scaled enemies in low level areas (Different from normal region scaling) - 15+ Colonel Gutsies is one hell of a greeting for an Ash Heap Event   
---
3) Pylons (New Mechanic) - This mechanic is somewhat old and I really haven't seen it used much in recent games so it took a few seconds to figure out what the hell was going on. The Damage from activating it is a dirty move, objectives should not nearly kill you in their own right.   
---
4) Sheepsquatch-thing - Very fast one-shotting enemy with very high health   
---
5) Short Event Timer - Seemed more than a tad short  
---
6) The collection of above points makes for a very poor learning experience because you just keep dying repeatedly from different things. You have very little time to check the slow to update objectives at the top right of your screen while your health is rapidly dropping constantly.   
---
Personally, it was a rough experience and I think some things need some tweaking to get the event to where it needs to be. Though, I am kind of happy they are trying harder content with a rewarding fight and enemy. =)
---
There is (maybe was) a bug where you get 200 instead of 100 extra carry upon loading into the game. Which disappears when you exit and re-enter PA
---
Glad to hear it. Guess I’ll try relogging, tired of killing these guys chasing me. x_X
---
Something similar happened to me a while ago. I ended up with a free complete ultracite PA that i didnt make.
---
Fully agreed OP. Vats does not make for good PVP at all
---
I got the same Problem.
---
Do you have a custom.ini on pc? Sometimes updates add new archives that need to be added to your custom.ini manually
---
It is ok with me, vats spotting has always been a cheesy tactic, but now you can hide in the woods with your weapon holstered looking to track your prey and so long as they dont naturally see you then you have nothing to worry about. Being genuinely hunted should give all those kill leaders a little extra dose of paranoia, LOL.
---
To make it look neater just put a "-" at the start, always makes it go to the top of the pip boy.
---
You sure it’s not the reward for the brotherhood questline? People get it all the time and don’t realize it’s in their inventory. If not the case then enjoy your free suit!
---
That’s just based on where they are now, there could be loot drops found while exploring, but hard bargain, grape mentats and high charisma from unyielding armour I’ve got them for 1750, plus the bots cap limit goes above 200 so bring lots of stuff to sell and get about 400 caps back from selling
---
Tyler county fairgrounds has tons of leather you can grab at the same time you go there to do the rubber run.
---
Solved. You can purchase one from the new Robo merchants in Whitesprings. 1900 caps with buffs!
---
Oh so it's not a new thing?
---
Is this a permanent or just a week long one?
---
yes. As well as regular molerats and glowing one
---
&gt; It would make life easier 
---
They don't seem to be interested in that route.  Look at the things they've nerfed.  TSEs.  Glowing Ghouls XP.  Watoga Legendaries.  Workshops.  Fusion Core percentages.  Nerf nerf nerf nerf nerf.  
---
I discovered an exploit the other day that makes the game way more fun for me personally.  But I know damn well it would be nerfed if Bethesda caught wind of it, so I'm keeping my mouth shut about what it is and how to do it.  I'm not abusing it in PvP, so my conscience is clear.
---
Ah, I had stumbled upon this event as a level 61, and I was a conduit the whole time. I was wearing power armor and there were several 100+ that focused on the boss and gutsies. I didn't even realize conduits took damage over time, i just assumed the eye bombs and gutsies were responsible for having to spam stimpacks lol
---
I'm sorry what am I supposed to change.
---
Oh, forgot to mention, you lose the bonus carryweight if you get killed or get out of armor, say to craft stuff. But simply sever jumping will re-enable it
---
^THIS omg I hate it being only one song
---
I haven't done their quests yet. But hey I got a few suit
---
Yup just found this one out too, bummer. There goes my whitespring cap farm.
---
I will be doing the same thing I did in 4:
---
Weapons preceded by a dot so they are all at the top of the weapons list - anything below it is fair game to scrap/drop.
---
Armor preceded by a semicolon so it too is at the top, but differentiated between it and weapons in the main list. Add "RA", "LL" etc for each piece so I know which it is for.
---
I think I'll just resign myself to hoping it gets triggered whilst I'm online. It's happened once so far but I got a no respawn glitch and couldnt finish it. Shrug.
---
Oh that's right, I completely forgot about that! Man sorry to hear that happened, especially when you're just giving back
---
Ever play a video games? Ever play a rpg? Or an MMO? You don’t add an entire class of weapon, with perks and armor and cosmetics to support it, you just intend for it to be unbalanced and worthless.
---
That actually makes the most sense. I mean, it wasn't necessary imo but I'll take it.
---
Few times legendary enemies that I have killed had actually dropped the weapon/armor in the ground. It looks like a dropped gun/armor and it has a big star in front of the default guns name. If I dont get it fast enought it will glitch trougth the groud and never show up in enemys inventory. Today I pickes up 2* AA/33 vats plasma rifle like this and after I relogged it had turned into 3* AA/33 vats/crit fill one, kid you not. I even have picturea of the weapon being 2* and minutes later same weapon being 3*
---
Had this happen then got stuck with an infinite loading screen trying to respawn.
---
Interesting. I'm admittedly quite inexperienced and it's good to hear the perspective of people who have played for a long time. I only purchased the game with the release of survival mode, I have no interest in the slap mechanic of adventure mode and mostly worried that players would save up vats criticals for PvP.
---
Lol definitely not, don't waste your time. I'm afraid you'll have to hunt on the market subs to see if anyone else has one or farm a few thousands enemies to get it again. Sorry bro. I got mine for free when I bought a different tesla off of someone a while ago haha.
---
Have to use the terminal to start the event and complete said event. It seems to have a timer between events though.
---
THOSE FUCKIGN STAIRS ARE WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR!!!
---
Same here. I tried server hopping and met a lot of people just waiting by the cabin. Is this how it's supposed to go?
---
Yes, the same cap pool, hence why I'm surprised they only reflected 3 caps when i only utilized half of the available vendors the day before.
---
The sasquatch battle in the ash heap
---
Same. Also the rewarded gun was level 30, even though I'm over level 100.
---
Computer says its recalibrating....try again later.....is that serious?
---
Try to open your map and look north of the burning mine should have a place called pylon something. Go there check the terminal and the quest is done for now
---
that's not my entire argument, actually not even something I argue, just something I saw that hundreds of people upvoted that turned to to be wrong
---
My guy  character is staying is his fucking dress!
---
Looks like these might be fixed rewards, not random, because I have the wolf, then radstag.... guess I’m gonna get Yao guai next.
---
Look at the calendar on the wall after setting the macines
---
Actually my question would have been if they did lie about santa and such would you completely distrust everything your parents ever said. Because half truths, misleading statements and out right lies of all kind happen every day.  So when people take these rather black and white stances on stuff that is always shades of grey it interests me to the logic behind it. 
---
Because part of being in a relationship is lieing to a certain degree. I know my wife doesn't like half my antics but she certainly lies about it. Just like when she isn't feeling well her hair a mess with snot running down her nose. In this instance she looks like a Halloween mask but if she asked how she looks the correct responds is beautiful not you look like a bad Halloween mask.
---
You get a free ultracite set when you complete Belly of the Beast. It doesn't tell you, it just pops is not inventory.
---
Did you complete that quest and maybe not notice? Otherwise other people have sporadically reported getting random ultracite sets but most of the time it came from the quest.
---
Lol yeah i got DC while downloading something, will try again thanks!! ❤❤
---
There were about a hundred metal piles everywhere. I checked everyone and I'm pretty sure all the other people were checking all of them and everyone kept dropping thumbs down so I'm assuming no one found it. But after further research I found that it doesn't really have any extra Loot on it besides whatever legendary it had. And I don't care too much about that. It's the event itself that drops through Wards I'm interested in and I guess my RNG was just not good enough LOL. Overall it was definitely fun though

hah, haven't thought about it that way before. You're right :P I'm all about ze weapones and le armors over here :P
---
Holy shit thanks for the PSA
---
Yea there’s a few issues today, saw the bone armour skin and bought it, can’t craft or repair/modify my pa 
---
I’m a bloodied build and had 2 others on the event when I did it ..... we died
---
Get this man a sticker!
---
Interesting. I had almost the same encounter a while back. Two guys working in tandem. A high level character with some explosive weapon and another with fists or a power fist that was lower level. I would keep killing his buddy, but he would 1-2 shot me. I kept going back until I was bankrupt because I decided that I would not let them take it. 
---
They took everything and then left me when they could get no more caps, and I couldn't reclaim it. Oh well. I won't do that anymore.
---
I haven't done that quest
---
Finally some raider love
---
I’m having a problem where I can put mods on x-01
---
Also making whitespring some sort of player hub where you can find everything.
---
That's what I was wondering.  Must be the case as without the decided alphabet, which comes by way of the cypher, there would be no way to determine the right sequence for the launch code.
---
It’s used in the creation of a recall card. You need one in order to start the new event (warning it’s harder than the SBQ lmao)
---
I'm not an expert on this situation. I'd post about it in r/confessions, or r/aita, or r/relationship_advice. I think the usual advice in these situations is "get a lawyer," a possibility you need to seriously contemplate.
---
Same guy
---
Dude, thanks so much.
---
Those were German accents?
---
Was it before this last patch? This was the first time I’ve tried so I have no idea.
---
You're welcome
---
Indeed, it's basically just an extremely strong 3* assaultron. [basically another world boss, like everyone has been asking for]
---
Did you check Default? Just looked and they’re down with them.
---
Got ya, thanks bro
---
Its most likely sold though
---
Were you in a team with your brother and did he have pacifist on as well? Maybe he slapped the other player and they now can come for everyone on the same team.
---
Question for a person who’s gonna buy it when it comes to steam, did they fix the 21:9 interface?
---
Damn it. Going to have to get one now. Or a dozen....
---
That is why I think PvP should be simply limited to Survival mode. It opens up more collaboration versus trying to learn new ways to be mean.
---
Pretty sure you can get a full set of the Ultrasight PA plans for free...
---
The sites will work until they:
---
* A. Change the algorithm
---
* B. Keep it serverside
---
What's your psn? I'm in Australia so time did might be hard. I'm LVL 105
---
Purchase what exactly?
---
There is a new event. The first time you do it's free but in order to restart the event you need that recall circuit board to craft an item.
---
This was definitely one of the hardest fights I’ve got into while playing 76! The SBQ is just a pain, this event was a massacre left and right. We were also 8-10 people and I think we all died at least 6+ times. Lowest level was 61 so it wasn’t a bunch of low levels with pipe guns either
---
I mean.. yes? That's what I said in the description. To attach a wire, you need to press space and jumping is space. So it gets confused and jumps instead of attaching the wire.
---
Same.  Dude followed me around an area for two hours Sunday and not one single insult...  Lame.
---
It has a cool effect as long as it's covered by clothes. Otherwise i don't want to look like a inmate/slave.
---
PC source was hackers getting into the dev room. Since it teaches you the plan to make more when you scrap it, it spread pretty well on PC.
---
Thx mate
---
Totally agree.  There isn't too much left to do and with the game being super stale, it's just nice to have something to do...
---
Damn should never have bought the Camo bundle. I really wanted it for the :Leather/Metal/Combat Armor Paints (bit of a steal for those) but now i dont have enough for the Bone Raider and i refuse to spend real money. Doubt i can make 300 Atoms in 4 days either. Most times im lucky if i can finish 1-2 Dailies as it is.
---
I'm talking about when I'm selecting targets with vats and someone comes flying in front of me. Take the whitesprings golf course for example. Sure I could perch up somewhere high to avoid this or maybe even use gun fu but I shouldn't have to. That's why I'm very thankful for this patch.
---
Wavy Willards Water Park?
---
Z Current - bla bla bla.
---
Best of both worlds
---
It's an event. Much like "Scorched Earth." Once you initiate the final step in that questline, it summons an uber-boss, which places an event marker on the map, which other players can and should come rushing to take part in.
---
OMG the game is literally playable again now!
---
Interns... I tell ya.
---
I assume the costume is a reward from the event too? Not just the hat
---
Wait. So I don't need to have the pieces? Just so I have a nuclear card?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ba2ea3/xbox_i_got_the_old_man_winter_mask/
---
It was just crazy rare, was it more rare than they expected or it should have been, probably... 
---
also dev-room exploits didn't exist for xbox/ps4 so anything popping up there had to be found in-game(duping did work on the other platforms)
---
I’m not sure if it’s automatic, but doing the new questline, I got a rad storm with a glowing radrat in it when fast traveling to a quest location.
---
Yeah.  I just stumbled into a new event that was IMPOSSIBLE.  But I am ok.  We didn’t know what we doing.  Or at least I didn’t.  And that’s ok.  We need challenging new material and this definitely qualifies!
---
Why nerf my milk. Wtf
---
Skeleton costume as well. Used to cost 5 plastic and 2 cloth(I think), and now it costs 5 plastic, 5 cloth and 4 bone and is also half as valuable.
---
Yeah seriously. Complete a daily for the challenge! But it won’t show up.
---
Yay now my bar can look even better
---
Ooft now there charging us 2k caps a crash
---
Exactly. As long as you know what code to punch in, you just need the card.
---
It is cylindrical
---
I will be doing that tonight!
---
Do you know where the recall card can drop?
---
Wonder if I can still play on my Virtual Boy? 🤔🤔
---
If they lied or not it makes my game play easier now that I can’t spend these useless atoms I have sitting around on something worth it thanks Bethesda 👌🏼
---
I had to hop once to get it to start, it’s like the fasnacht event
---
I should have added this on here.  Like 10ft south of the lead deposit is a circular area.  there is a consistent Fresh Grave spawn right there with 2-4 ghouls at it.  Spawns like once every 2 days.  
---
Did know it was there for a minute as I put my camp north of the lead deposit an it just happened to be outside my camp zone.   I got a feeling if it was inside the camp zone it wouldn't have spawned.
---
 how many times? What?
---
lol well first of all you cant stack drugs like that and second of all you probably got addicted to it now you need to take an adictol to remove it
---
Yeah ur kind ain't welcome here.
---
Yeah same, it was a nice change of pace from being superman
---
Hmm.  Then I suppose I need to edit it and say "Make the cylinder taller, by like 50 or 100%."  Thanks
---
Also Grafton High School is a great place for Rubber, got a container of Basketballs, a container of kickballs. Whitesprings for your glass and plastic I think Morgantown High School
---
 what?
---
Yeah I'm pretty stoked about that part. And honestly I wasn't even expecting it when it went down. Did it instance me into another server with people that were starting it at the exact same time? Because the second all the robots showed up there were like 10 plus people instantly there. On a side note I do hope the new dungeons are going to be really hard
---
This is a good thing. Fuck people who spend 8 hours server hopping and sniping mods from vendors so none of the rest of us can get them. This would just make their lives 800x easier
---
It'll never happen in 76 I'd say. They don't even wanna give us log cabins or stairs that use only 1 square
---
&gt;!You'll find a button behind the front desk. Click it to open the display case. Grab the bone and take it to the basement. Here you simply put it in the wolf (on the wall)'s mouth and you'll get the password.!&lt;
---
There was another change made to the vendors that is annoying as f&amp;%$. The alphabetizing now skips the "(plan)" so all the plans are lumped together. Being level 125 and collecting plans, I could easily scroll past all the known ones. Now I have to pay way more attention when I scroll.
---
I edited my post. It’s 4.5 stories up and down
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/Uwtc8T7
---
The quest ends there, it's not a bug.
---
There's a new event that you can start by using the terminal at the ambush site.
---
Hey you tried verifying your game files from the game client? I did that and it fixed it!
---
Yeah I can no longer afford to make confederate hats and sell them, they require more materials now and their price was reduced 👎
---
i suspect there is some timer between event activations and maybe - some limitation mechanics. In the terminal at pylon ambush site you could read that we need keycard to activate event and this card is (as written) one-time use only, so - it could be one-activation-per-character limitation. Besides - i completed event \~2 hours ago and now i still cant activate event - "system is recalibrating, try again later" (or some sort of this), so - event is disabled by Bethesda for maintanance, or we have more then 2h delay between activations for a whole server.
---
Add calibrated shocks to each leg an it's an extra 200 carry weight ;)
---
Also for combat if you use melee make sure you add motion assist servos to give you that extra strength.
---
I just wish the 3* sheepsquatch didn’t drop a 1* dagger when I die 5x and use 20 St impacts on myself and others
---
Whelp.
---
Time to get the credit card out again.
---
Yep, I received the costume, rather than the hat.
---
Post a picture of your Quests screen as proof that you haven’t done the quests. Then this can be a serious discussion.
---
If you need to make aniother Assaultron Recall Keycard, you can purchase the needed component card from the new vendors in Whitesprings. It sells for about 1900 caps after buffs.
---
Just paste that over the entry already in place. Looks like the files with 03 are the newest additions.
---
I know some mods want a different line added as well, so it may require some tweaking if Atom Shop items are acting up.
---
On lunch at the moment but not enough time to test it (er, if things aren't working).
---
Put calibrated shocks on any power armor and you get +100 carry weight plus decent armour.
---
Yeah and if you had calibrated shocks it will be like +300 those were fun times lol.
---
So my only question on that, is how did you place the CAMP module in midair so that the ceiling would be so high?  If you place it on the ground, there's no way to get it that high, and if you place it and then move it around the camp with Edit mode, that doesn't change the cylinder...
---
Well I think starting low and going high is much better than starting high and slowly tuning it down. The old system was way too much if a penalty for higher level characters, at 100 you would lose a whole vendor or caps per death. 
---
At least this way people can enjoy the mode without the huge punishment chasing them away, while they fine tune the best zone for matching risk and reward.
---
They nerfed cival war hat, what's the best thing to cap farm now?
---
Hacked? When it's hacked, why isn't the Bravo code already online? As i understood this, you can get different launchcodes. The website that has the tool, just does this, what everyone can do. Then it's just a matter of having enough keycards, to test every code.  
---
It's not cheating. Just other people are doing the work. Sure you can argue if this is the right way to do. Getting ready to launch a nuke is not that hard. Solving the launchcode probably. I think everyone should do this at least once the intended way and can double check the code later. Yeah you can do this always the intended way but you gain nothing from it. You only need to launch one nuke, to have the quests done and once it should done the right way but over and over? It's like saying you must do every quest alone and people can't help you finding stuff.
---
I'm not making another one though, this is my first keycard, if the only option is to spend like 90% of my caps to complete the quest, that is shithouse design. I am not someone who farms vendors every day for caps.
---
For me it has been spherical, requiring the tallest point to be positioned only in the center.
---
Hmm..I only thought you couldn't stack the same chems.  You can't stack any?  I don't think I was addicted, but I'll try it again for science when I get home
---
As long as people are using the pylons it’s ok. You’re going to die still though. We failed my last attempt because I was the only one clicking the pylons.
---
Weird because it didn’t even say it didn’t finish or anything the game just got stuck
---
*Teleports behind you* 
---
Nothing personal, kid.
---
We did it, died a lot whixh makes a nice change from everyone walking around like superman
---
Honestly, it has been awhile since I needed to mine, so I may be misremembering.
---
its part of the new quest, you need it to craft an item to activate the new event
---
The only thing I'm confused by is how you're supposed to stay alive as the conduit. There's obviously killing off the Eyebombs before they reach you, but in my X-01 armor and having well over 600 energy damage resistance, I was killed instantly upon becoming the conduit. I don't know if that was a bug or what, because I saw other people standing as the conduit being totally fine. I'll have to run the event again to see what I can learn, but I'm putting all of my junk away, just in case.
---
I didn't find it impossible. Guess i got lucky then with the people that came. Died really fast.
---
I stuck it in the limb of a tree
---
You have to buy it every time you want to do the quest
---
Dang it! Thats like my one good weapon.
---
My first run was before I'd done the new quest. I joined what I thought was just a normal new event and I managed it with only one death. When I completed the quest I had to server hop a few times to start  the event and it was a massacre, I must have used 40+ stim packs and died 10's of times in under a minute with a load of level 100+ people. On my last death, I bugged out and could respawn so ended up crashing it out.
---
I don't mind it being hard as I'm used to an easy run with my load out now but it has shown me I need to work get some better energy resistant power armour.
---
I was just hoping I didn’t miss anything special
---
They should be a level unlock then - not a perk card. Level 10 you get pick and hack 1, level 25 pick and hack 2, level 50 pick and hack 3.
---
Well, here’s the silver lining: that mod doesn’t work for 1h/2h. It’s rumored to work for unarmed but I haven’t tested it yet. 
---
Also, it almost certainly doesn’t stack even if it did work- only use 1. The regular armor mods that reduce Power attack cost don’t stack.
---
If you still have your first card, then you are stuck where I am at. Only thing I've read so far is that the  "event" need to reset. Trying to find a server with an active event as we speak. Sorry I can't help more.
---
Oh my.  Tons of good things in here.  I am happy i dont have to teleport around to all the damn vendor bots and the caps are a large pool now.  Naming shit is pretty sweet.  Cant wait for the 16th! Now we just need some more monthly events to get people together that are fun.
---
I gotta agree, I was really looking forward to wearing it with the cowboy hat for a look like the Mojave Manhunter mod for Fallout 4 only to be disappointed when it took off my hat.
---
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lyFo83mzbWI/maxresdefault.jpg
---
Is there another mod other than heating coil for the super sledge?
---
It was positioned just below the turret platform (floor 5)
---
Is there a suit that goes with the hat?
---
Haven't found the event once after multiple server hops
---
I haven't done the quest yet. From what i'm reading it seems you need some kind of key to start the event? So I think you can buy the 2400 cap item from vendors now and craft that key to start the event.
---
Follow the stream, cave will be on the left near the top.
---
Karma point for Science, well done sir
---
Look for pieces of random gibberish (such as :89.,’, basically anything that’s not words) and check if it’s surrounded by brackets! () [] {} &lt;&gt; if you select one, it either refills your tries, or removes a “dud” word. (A word that isn’t the right one )
---
Your welcome for the tip!
---
May the mothman’s glowing presence shine on you as you hack those terminals!
---
I occasionally have had quests I never actually have in my quest log give me rewards.  Usually, when it happens, I get the music and animated vault boy as if I  had completed it.
---
Perhaps that's what happened in this case?
---
...never got anything as cool as an Ultracite set though.
---
I agree with you 100%. I never server hop unless the server is laggy. I just usually check the mods every time I go to a vendor in case there is something I want.
---
Wow I wondered before but have always tracked down the pieces. I have 3 cards or so. Thanks!
---
you're not even worth insulting
---
Thanks my man, all hail the mothman
---
I just added a prefix of numbers before the actual name. 
---
Example:
---
1- 2 shot CS (combat shotgun)
---
1- 2 shot Prime CS
---
1- Troubleshooter’s CS
---
1- TSE Handmade
---
This way the most used items, and most importantly the ones that DONT get sold, are at the top of the list and easily accessible. 
---
I’ve done the same for armor. 1- is power armor frames, 2- is non PA armor pieces, and 3- is for temporary gain armor (charisma pieces, intelligence pieces, etc).
---
Looking for the same answer. Have tried server hopping, and no luck yet finding an active" event" terminal.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/bimsw41
---
I think there is a timer between events just like any other one. If you could just hop and keep doing it that would be a lot of 3 star loot.
---
This. Loving all the other stuff from the update, but having to exit and enter the bench each time I repair something is pretty annoying.
---
Is the bone raider skin literally going away after 4 days? As in you'll never be able to buy it again?
---
I can’t attach mods to my armor. It gives me the warning that current mod will be destroyed, and nothing happens when I press «attach».
---
I suppose one facet is I would be willing to overlook a lie if it was 100% harmless and ultimately changed nothing. The microtransaction lie here doesn't fall under that so I just declined to mention that. Part of the argument people made for the game was "they say they'll keep microtransactions strictly cosmetic so P2W arguments against it are completely irrelevant". That may have been an influencing factor on sales to some people. Thus the lie made a difference.
---
Some say lying requires an intent to deceive so if you aren't actually trying to influence anything in some way is it really a lie? As per your example, is there any real change by lying there? I still don't like that class of lie (if someone asked me a question like that I'd try to answer honestly in some way "you look ill" or avoid the question "you really asking that when you're sick?").
---
I get to looks like daedra in fallout power armor?! All of my nerd dreams have come true!
---
My five piece, mix-matched, varying level, 3\* troubleshooter's armor set will finally see true glory.
---
Now, if only some of the fights required underwater breathing, its full potential will be realized.
---
They went to the opposite extreme but starting low and raising it slowly is much better than having high punishment and making it slowly more tolerable.  I would've prefered they just put a cap on the loss. Say 150. High levels after 75 don't really have a massive advantage.  I say 75 because sometimes you don't have the full perk loadout you want by 50. But by 75 even non optimal players should be running their full build. 
---
But this will at least keep the servers populated for the challenges.
---
Not the first time
---
Was it the costume to go with the hat? Or was it the "imposter" outfit?
---
I add a \* to the front of every name. Puts them all at the top of the list, easy to find
---
I do the opposite and use ZZ = Details of the weapon / armour
---
This way it goes to the end of my list and its less likely I'll accidentially sell it
---
no reward or anything? I got to that point and nothing happened
---
Thank you. When I log out to switch characters I have to have everyone go downstairs or get into power armor. It’s 9 stories at the downhill side and that’s a fatal drop. 
---
If you’re on PC, you’re welcome to visit.
---
What 4 side quests?
---
How the hell did I not think of that?  Thanks man
---
To all the people who quit early on, you can come back now, games fixed
---
You are complaining about people buying items from vendors? K
---
I’m fairly certain the new questline autotriggers a radstorm and a glowing creature at one of the very early quest locations... so that’s something
---
At least on PC they change the button to open it from r to e. Try a different button if you are on console maybe.
---
See my reply to the first comment
---
No player vendors yet, tho? :(
---
My camp menu is blank, How do I fix this?
---
It should! Faschnaut is a real life German tradition, (I think?)
---
Do the new questline, I think the second location you visit is an automatic radstorm with a glowing enemy
---
I'm pretty new to the game but it seems like the issue of sentinel/assassin armour comes up a lot. I think it's clear there needs to be strong nerfing or removal of items from survival mode that are clearly unbalanced in a PVP context, this is one of the main reasons I think there should be a wall between survival and adventure mode.
---
Do you know how deadlines are determined? Here's a summary:  
---
\-Management: We want exciting new content, include this, this and this!
---
\-Development Team: We can do that in about 7 weeks!
---
\-Management: Excellent! \*Turns to intercom while everyone shuffles out\* "Sharon get on the horn to Marketing and tell'em to start advertising a full DLC line-up to be released in 4 weeks!"
---
Do the new questline, I’m fairly sure a very early location is an automatic radstorm with glowing eenmh
---
If they keep coming up with things like this, I'm going to go broke.
---
Yeah, that's how it ends. No reward, no notification... nothing.
---
To be honest, I don't know if this was intended or if it's a bug, but as far as I know everyone got that 'ending'. There's nothing else after reading that terminal (except the event).
---
yeah i couldn't see a thing with all the lag
---
I hope so. He's in the files. But I haven't seen him yet. I'm sadbois if he doesnt exist ingame.
---
Happy to help, took me a moment to find the button initially as well.
---
Same. Just with weapons.
---
It’s a different button haha.
---
This ^
---
I don't think 'SeventySix - MiscClient.ba2' is in the right place.
---
In my Fallout76.ini, the following line had MiscClient:
---
    SResourceArchiveMemoryCacheList = SeventySix - Interface.ba2, SeventySix - Materials.ba2, SeventySix - MiscClient.ba2, SeventySix - Shaders.ba2
---
I agree, but it could also provoke some people to come and destroy it
---
Its datamined and assumed that the "War Rider" paint for the T-45 will come out this week as well :) I'm so excited, this is content I will GLADLY pay for from the Atomic Shop
---
they just removed the preview screen. Just use the X or A button pal
---
“Rocket Science”
---
Where cal's office ?
---
It was a huge topic of discussion for the first two months. While I personally can neither confirm nor deny it, the fact that you can go with ten high level players and barely tickle her, when you could initially kill her fairly quick and easy with a few guys, seem to indicate there might be something to it.
---
Either that, or every level 200-300 doing PvE nowadays are firing blanks.
---
All the Unsolved mystery side quest give you mounted head plans
---
Do the quest and you get the plans as a reward
---
After wondering around the camp for about an hour i think i can confirm its not a common thing to have happen lol
---
Yep. That’s what I heard. But sadly I got marker.
---
I do not think the overall mechanics are much of an issue with the exception of the DoT effect you get from being a conduit.  If you want to call the Bombots a mechanic, sure, you can tack that on but they are just very annoying enemies.
---
I think the best way to really explain how the event works is to think of it like a raid encounter in Destiny - you have to do one thing in order to hurt the boss.  In this case, it is having three people activate the pylons in order to be able to damage the boss.
---
I think the main problems stem with the amount of enemies that spawn and the insane damage the Sheepsquatch Assaultron deals.  Being swarmed by Level 50+ Mister Gutsy’s and Protectrons at each pylon while Bombots explode in your face is tough, even in Power Armor.  This event is also not Melee-friendly as it seems.
---
You definitely need a lot of people for the event because there is just so much going on.
---
Awesome patch overall especially the fact that you dont target friendly or neutral targets in vats anymore
---
So i wont have to worry about randoms stealing my loot in nuke zones? Best patch ever
---
Thank you very much
---
I'm just saying that I don't think its a mechanic that lends itself well to PVP. You can disagree with that but don't confuse it with an issue of fairness.
---
In case you don't know, there are 4 new side quest besides the Lying Down one. You can start them by reading the notes on the map at Calvin's office.
---
You have to interact with the terminal to start the event.
---
Cal’s office is on the third floor of the Taxidermy place in Lewisburg. You have to access the terminal in his office for the Lying Lowe quest for the Sheepsquatch
---
Great! Thank you for letting us know.
---
/u/valseek can you check on this for us?
---
You mentioning destiny brought back many amazing memories from long ago thank you sir
---
Is this a Horde event? Or a new event all together?
---
In that building, there is a map, we already sawn and there are 4 notes that you can read and every starts a side quest. I call it that way, because it has a own quest entry.
---
By default, Bethesda no longer uses 'sResourceArchiveMisc'.  I still use it for BetterInventory.
---
So you can only get 1 per day ?
---
So if I set of a nuke now, and another team wipes all the enemies before I have a chance, those enemies will no longer have glowing masses on them? Previously if I happened upon a pile of dead glowing ghouls, that I had no part in killing in one of my nuke zones, some would have glowing/hardened masses and on them. So I was still getting something for my effort of setti g the nuke off
---
Doesn’t work for me in vendors on PC
---
I've been farming Whitespring since level 18. Just have to know how to do it.
---
Still no rotating Nuka Cola lamp. Sigh . . .

Do you have a mic?
---
I really liked that fallout 3 was especially wastelandy
---
Neat need to go back
---
Question can u give powersrmor chasse custome names
---
You run out of quests before you get them all
---
Well that makes one other person.. phew lol.
---
As someone that held off, and then didn't buy due to reviews, is the game worth purchasing now?
---
Do lots of damage.
---
Just want to ask that you take a look at the interaction between class freak and mutations (specifically empath). Since launch, class freak does not impact empath. Hope you further clarify or fix this issue in a future patch.
---
How did you get yao gui?
---
Wait what are you talking about? Im at work and cant check out the new update :(
---
That’s my understanding but I can’t confirm, as I’ve only done it the one time. Which took several server hops to get it to work.
---
Where does this collar comes from?
---
From looking at the screenshot above, it seems to be the one that goes with the hat. Like a dirty grey variant of the one in the Atomic Shop.
---
I saw those cards for sale in the MISC section of vendor bots.
---
How to make it 8 stories tall ? I never achieve to go over 4? Maybe 4.5?
---
I didn't read all of it, but I like everything I read. Great job dudes.
---
What I noticed is that 3 Players need to Sync and stay Synched with the Pylons
---
Just trying to play after the update but it has been difficult as the servers keep crashing. And even though I'm not wearing chameleon I go stealth for 1 sec after I kneel down. The environmental visuals load worse then before also.
---
are you using any camp related mods?
---
Lol at one point I had over 8 and gave it to my buddies I still have mines on my character , a wedding ring on my finger as well
---
I may try Hacking the robots
---
It has a cool down so doesn't trigger for everyone.  I had to server hop a few times trying the terminal on each until I got it to trigger
---
New
---
If you are buying - need all vendors there
---
If you are selling - only need one vendor( but other players may be using a vendor so now you can go to a different one)
---
Swiss but you are 100% correct as it will return. I guess Bethesda wants to add more real events ingame.
---
Same who knows maybe it's a 2 part event and we will release them in the borrows
---
I've had an offer, they weren't available at the time. I'm going to check with them and see if they're on, one moment
---
&gt; Fuck people who spend 8 hours server hopping and sniping mods from vendors so none of the rest of us can get them.
---
That's... not how vendor stocks work.
---
He isnt actually spawned yet but you hit where his marker is in game. this caused the quest to progress. this quest shouldnt have been accessible and was most likely unintentionally added
---
I thought it was Great that it's hard right now!!! Bring on more Challenges!!!
---
Yes correct. Also theres 4 quests available in the board iside the taxidermist house top floor, it seems they are daily(?). Cause once you done with them,you can read them but the quests wont start a second time.
---
I don't get what you're saying
---
You can find them in the prison in the toxic valley, if I’m not mistaken.
---
I actually enjoyed it, finally a "challenge" in the game that requires more than just shooting/smacking it. Just give it some time, it's literally a brand new event not everyone knows how to do it, it'll become a bit easier soon.
---
And to think I only started doing the confederate hat trick a few days ago...
---
The game is a lot better now than at launch.  There are still some bugs but it's fun.  I play with a big group though.  There's 12 of us and someone's always on.  If you're a solo player then I'm not sure how to review it honestly.  A lot of end game stuff is easier with friends and PVP I'd bring a partner in no matter what.  I do think it's worth buying though but not for $60 unless there was some type of digital collection.
---
Old man winter mask, you shall be mine one day!
---
.....one day
---
On Xbox. Thanks though!
---
Nope, that’s the only one.
---
I am having the same issue (yes I know that doesn’t help) maybe try r1?
---
Oh ic, never had seen them b4 this patch, looks like a trend now.
---
No it's a new item it works like a recon scope
---
Ok btw my game is 65% complete downloading
---
They are where all the vendors in Whitespring are.  Mixed in with the existing vendors.
---
All over the market areas
---
What insult bot? Never seen it in 400+ hours.
---
In Van Lowe Taxidermy, where everything is pinned to the wall all detective style, there are notes that will start the other quests. :) hope this helps.
---
Interesting post
---
There are many image hosting websites.  Imgur is a common one.
---
They're in the shops with the other traders
---
ahh, great! so we just need to find out what the cooldown of event's possible activations
---
Ah, sorry, the buyer was on and waiting for me, thanks tho
---
Looks like I'm grinding out challenges every night this week then..
---
Its fine
---
Is that what the deal is with the golfers? I've been stuck at 8/10 for months.  
---
And the funny thing is, I don't think I actually killed any to begin with. Do you get credit for killing them if you're simply in the area and other players kill them?
---
I can confirm what the other people are saying. These have nothing to do with the repair kit issue. War Rider in particular has been in the files since the PC Beta
---
I may break my own personal promise of not spending a penny on atoms. A lot of this stuff is just so cool.
---
Random encounter were a protectron would insult you, or at least for some people he did
---
The one I did it was a bunch of bots and a 3* legendary sheepsquach, it was an even that came up with a banner saying (Event: Cryptid) or something like that down in the ash heap at a cabin. It was definitely a lot of fun! Don’t want to spoil the surprise to much though :)  but make sure your gear is ready to take a beating
---
i would have little problem with the event itself a challenge is good now and then but i would like to play it without my frames being murdered
---
It's a new event at the end of the new quest line. It's much harder than SBQ at the moment but mainly because people don't know what to do. 
---
Suggest you read the final terminal in detail as it tells you what to do. Also take good energy resist armour, a ton of stim packs and perk yourself for a beating. 
---
Note: The event has a cool down which is leaving people wondering why nothing happens at the end. I had to server hop to get a terminal I could activate to trigger the event. Its live Evan all over again.
---
Alright then, why don't you explain how you kill it ...
---
Thank you! Nobody else responded so you helped alright
---
I don't have a gatling plasma to test it, but I'm pretty sure they work the same way.
---
Playing a bit more, what I think is happening is just incorrect ammo count being shown.
---
All cores reload to 999, even if they are like 25% full.
---
A 25% core will then deplete at 750, so it's in fact still working fine, but the numbers are off.
---
Did they stealth-fix the recipe for one of the beers?  I could have sworn I had a beer type that annoyingly required those rare strangler blooms that only occasionally spawn along the river in the mire.  But I don't seem to have any alcohol recipes that require those anymore.
---
I don’t know about that, I still find events to be a free for all soon completion message fades off the screen lol
---
All is just a texture glitch
---
Could have at least tried to explain..
---
This is the first time I've actually wanted to buy atoms because of that new raider excavator armor
---
The Dude does not abide.
---
Lol I did it not even 5 minutes ago so it was fresh!
---
Do you use chems to buff your strength?
---
A multi color texture glitch at the side of the map near ransacked bunker
---
Man, was just thinking. Add mini-vaults to the game for guild bases. Your guild chooses a spot and it makes an overworld hatch that leads to an underground instanced base (so that it can be large without messing with overworld limits) your guild can build.
---
Frame rate was fine for me, but we got annihilated. Used 30+ stims, died about ten times, and did minimal damage to the assaultron. If I can ever sort my carry weight out enough to be able to ditch my excavator PA, I'm bringing my Troubleshooters armour set and a matching weapon if I have a good one
---
Fuck you dumb cunt not
---
I'm not sure if you want spoilers or not on how to obtain the key but I will say it's absurdly easy. When I used mine is when it seems like a ton of other people were there so I'm not sure if they saw an event marker or not let me know if you figure it out
---
Mountain Dew voltage with more radiation
---
Saw plushies and sat up straight in my chair. 😍😍😍
---
I don't see how that could be a problem if they did the simple thing. I played FFXIV and really what they did was give the leader the ability to assign permissions to ranks. Low ranks were "deposit" only to bank.
---
Press the inspect button then it'll give you a rename option
---
Automatron 76?
---
Coming with Player Vending.  Along with the camp pacifist mode changes.
---
What about heavy? Like in the Allrise?
---
Yeah and the missions were confusing as well (Stating off about a cryptid then turns into a 60's spy movie.
---
Bone raider isn’t skin for raider PA?  Ahhhhh
---
I dont think people plsy survival to play casual
---
Not at the moment of trying to kill stuff. I do have like 8 mutations from serums though. And when I mean no damage, I mean its a swing and a miss.
---
Yeah I managed to find the event for once, and I got the mascot head first try.
---
Someone else got the impostor head which is like a dead sheep's dead as a hood.
---
Nice, thank you. This was driving me crazy. Can’t believe I overlooked pressing inspect.
---
Yes... It is... Dipshit...
---
I'm so freaking dumb
---
One shot grux those where the days lol
---
Do I guess I SHOULDN’T have gotten rid of my quad assaultron head yesterday 😭
---
Hmm.  I'll have to double check, but Pickaxe Pilsner did require Strangler Blooms.  Luckily it's also an existing item and you can just find the beer directly and don't need to craft it.
---
(Also the Tick Blood one requires Stable Crimson Flux...)
---
I hope they didn’t. You aren’t psychic and repair kits aren’t pay2win no matter how many tines you repeat it.
---
Would you find 20 caps reasonable?
---
Im on regular 1 TB ps4 and it was manageable for me. Delay when i first fast traveled there but it leveled out
---
okay so this confused me to but i figured it out theirs an option on the terminal to start the event and fight the fake sheepsquatch but it doesn't work if someone on the server did the event recently so you have to server hop until you find one that works and i think after you kill the robot sheepsquatch you use it to lure the real one but i'm not sure since i can't beat the event
---
I got destroyed by that stim-eating quest and barely did any damage, along with the others in the event. I'm gonna bring my Troubleshooters armour next time and hope some decent players come by
---
Prefer it to be a cube instead.  I hate the circle border!
---
hmm, no idea. I had a bug that chems that boost SPECIAL stats were reducing them, that's why I was wondering
---
I can imagine in player vending there will be a big demand for items sold under vendor value. Buy them from players, sell for profit. Since every player is capped at 1400 a day, it leaves a big profit margin for those who over grind and allows casuals to make good profit for little effort.
---
No, it's not.  My teammates and I are sitting at the vendors seeing different stocks of items.  The only items that are shared are the ones players sell.  That's why server hopping works, cause vendor inventories are instanced and each player gets a new inventory when they join the server.  You can even get new inventories when you join the SAME server you just left (via joining your teammates again).
---
They didnt remove vendors though did they? Like Tweed and flintlock all the original ws stores and robots are still there?
---
When I load in I get glowing squares for about 5 minutes on the ground. Same thing happened to a friend.
---
We shouldn’t have to server hop to complete it imo
---
They brought back the Raider icon so most likely they will in the future
---
I’m having this also
---
^^ this
---
Insult bot now insults you
---
It does, I server hopped 6 times before I was able to use my card on the terminal to trigger it. The other times it said process aborted.
---
After losing over 7000 caps in Survival Beta week 1, I can only agree it was an excellent decision.
---
Yea that kinda why I wanna put in a picture
---
THERE IS A HUGE STUTTER FREEZING PROBLEM ON PS4 AND PC SINCE THE PATCH TODAY. YOUR SUPPORT SAID TO CONTACT PS FOR HELP BUT ITS NOT THEM ITS YOU!!!! PLEASE HELP IS ITS LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE
---
Ghoul Slayers Metal Chest Piece 1\*
---
Useless AND heavy
---
thats nice :)
---
Is it an event that spawns in the world?
---
Same with me and Overdrive Servo mod for Excavator Power Armour. Great job Bethesda.
---
Just pop on an excavator, go to Harpers ferry, or any place with high level scorch/mutants/ mole men grab their weapons get overemcumbered if need be close to a vendor and go mass sell the weapons. Uranium fevers mine, and harpers ferry would both be solid places close to vendors.
---
All the originals are still there.
---
Pretty sure it's good ol' Wes Johnson, aka Mr Burke, Lucien Lechance, and The Silver Shroud.
---
Yes, all still there and standing around the shops are the new ones.
---
Yay! Bethesda is very dedicated to make this game from a buggy mess into a polished masterpiece bit by bit
---
Anytime :)
---
Yeah the difficulty really took me by surprise, was on my own and nearly instantly got spitroasted by exploding eyebits and that fucking laser beam. Luckily at least 10 more heads quickly showed up and we managed to kill it.
---
So when do we fight the *real* sheepsquatch? Future update?
---
The heavy rocket isnt a mod you can acquire for the super sledge. It is unique to the all rise
---
I’ve done the event twice and it appears to just be over. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
That was happening to me too over the weekedn. Take psychobiff get negative carry weight lol like wtf
---
The F076 filthy casuals sub is even better
---
That's his name! Couldn't remember. Thanks.
---
Two shot effect only consumes one bullet.  But it fires two.
---
They succeed everytime mods let them flood the sub with identical posts and bot upvote those posts to make them look legit.
---
There will always be a small group of people who despise FO76 because it wasn’t FO5 and despise the players for enjoying it.
---
Pretty sure it's permanent. It's now a normal world event like the Moth man one or Feeding People and the likes.
---
Only consumes 1 bullet per shot, blindfire or vats and you’ll definitely notice the spread
---
Nope. Event Ends. You get Legendary Loot and Quest Apparel. Thats all.
---
The new event probably makes this possible.  Whenever they come out with new content, they make some of the challenges focused on that content.
---
Reading this, I'm obviously appreciative of how these patches are making the game better, but I just wanted to say I also really hope that they build on Fallout 76 as a base when Fallout 5 properly goes into production. 
---
The teams on Fallout 76 have done a tonne of work making this game much more stable and performant than Fallout 4 ever was, and fixed a lot of long-standing bugs from previous games. Would be a lot of good work wasted if they don't use 76 as a springboard.
---
If you do find yourself in a rad storm, there is a glowing mole dude who always spawns in Welch (as long as you are like above level 40 I think).
---
I see it now, thanks!
---
What vendor sells the item do you know?
---
Yeah that one its so so depressing, I found the nicest damn place over a small river with a mini waterfall into a pond and... and...
---
Another Tip: And stash all the junk you definitely don't wanna lose too. You WILL die during this event.
---
Seems like most/all of them, or at least most of the ones I looked at when I went to whitespring.
---
There have ALWAYS been a few ridiculously hard challenges every few days. Don’t make shit up about data and spread it like it’s fact. Unless you have an actual source for this paranoia?
---
I use the *
---
Seems like I see a lot more radstorms near Watoga, might be worth hunting around there to boost the odds a bit
---
Just pop on an excavator, go to Harpers ferry, or any place with high level scorch/mutants/ mole men grab their weapons get overemcumbered if need be close to a vendor and go mass sell the weapons. Uranium fevers mine, and harpers ferry would both be solid places close to vendors. You can sell the weapons for 30+ caps easily since cap pool will be shared you could easily knock out quite a large chunk pretty fast. Yeah weapons are heavy so farm close to a vendor or stash everything you don't immediately need excavator with both legs upgraded could give you +200 max carry weight. Thats enough for 10-15 weapons. 
---
Get xp, legendary chances, and money without sitting in a menu for half an hour crafting something .
---
That’s really cool! Nice looking base too.
---
OMG ... I'm absolutely going to do this.
---
Yep 100% 😂
---
Yes. Bought motion assist servos for T-51B. Can’t attach it.
---
You get one for doing the BoS quest when you find Taggerty's body in that cave with all the scorched
---
Never mind, i just got it :)
---
Why didn't you just tell them what to do?
---
This sounds like...fun?  It does, but ooooooo, so many questions that I don’t want to ask yet.
---
Oh not the novel, the movie:

---
http://www.badmovies.org/othermovies/startroopers/startroopers2.jpg
---
Me too. I just started doing it and Bethesda said no
---
Agreed!
---
Are these quests repeatable?
---
Well there are several ways to beat sentinel/assassin's armor. I do not think it needs to be nerfed. And I say this as someone who does not use and often fights set users. You have radiation damage, staggers, and critical hits. 
---
I feel they should buff critical hits so the critical portion of the damage calculation is able to bypass the damage cap. This would make black powder critical builds fantastic counters. It also would make high Endurance viable for surviving that one shot. I have been crunching the numbers and high endurance with health bonus perks would give you a big enough health pool to survive some of the highest base damage weapons and critical builds.
---
Is there any buzz about dog companions being hinted at or is that plan completely scrapped?
---
Thank gooooooodness. I finally got the legs and was going crazy over the chest
---
&gt;How do you change the name for the Power Armor Chassis? Please share this forbidden knowledge. ty!
---
I agree. I#d rather pay money for that than for Repair Kits and Fridges.
---
At first I thought it would be a skin for raider power armor, would be nice to have a skin for power armor that you can get early on.
---
Yes, yes, and yes. In modern warfare, hand-to-hand combat is secondary to ranged combat. It's just how things are.
---
It also devalues caps even further than they already are. Now you can bring every lvl 2 alt you have to whitesprings, sell and easily that 7k caps a day with no need of doing enclave quests, exploring the map, etc...
---
Oh I should have been clearer: it was the movie that had heavy Fascist/Nazi overtones.
---
The point of Survival was to move PVP onto different servers.  In my opinion reducing the payout for the risks was a mistake.  The folks that like PVP like the adrenaline.  Reducing the stakes so much reduces the dopamine hit, defeating the very purpose for making Survival mode in the first place.  A better solution would have been limiting payout per death to 200 caps regardless of level and keeping a 1:1 cap/lvl ratio in both environments.
---
Not hoarding Atoms, but I’m in the group that doesn’t buy anything from the Atomic Shop. And don’t plan on it. 
---
So I definitely can’t speak for everyone, but I’m sure I’m not the only one alone in this.
---
It's been multiple extremely awkward daily challenges, every day for weeks.
---
If you wanna try, I got BoS legs the other night from Top of the World. I have not seen the chest or an arm dupe, but I did get legs
---
Dont worry. Theres more of us out there. I was hitting R on pc, getting pissed off thinking my game was messed up and saw that it was E now.
---
Yeah this game is gonna be bringing out new content on an ongoing basis, but it's not a live service game.
---
I was searching for a post like this.
---
Within 1 hour I had 2 servers not responding. The frame rate of environmental static objects loads terrible in the background. When I run the servers cannot keep up with rendering. Had a endless flat wastland in watoga, looked like a scene from conan or dune. These issues are experienced by my friends in my fo76 play group so it wasn't just me.
---
One of those notes on the thing for side quests
---
I hoard them, too, mostly because I rarely see things I actually want. That doesn’t somehow magically imply Bethesda is in a dark room folding their fingers and shaking a fist at a database screen.
---
It was a limited time carpet in the atomic shop. Not available for purchase atm.
---
Correct. It doesn't fit the definition of a live service game.
---
Locked at lvl 30 really suck... Just why Todd why? I love fallout anyway, but why lock unique items as low lvl?
---
So it is really worth buying?   For some reason I think I favor the forthcoming Cybermen chrome skin.
---
I assume since every vendor is subject to RNG when you first login and check them, they just used the same mechanics.
---
Seems like these are basically keys to activate the new event.(Imposter Sheepsquatch World boss)
---
Would have to guess they're consumable each time you start the event, so basically a cap sink that gives you a 3* enemy every time.
---
Welcome to the world of snipers.  
---
You may find it annoying, but it’s an age old tactic.  
---
Snipers camp.  You get close and they know they are dead, so they make sure they have the advantage for their build.  
---
Yeah, it’s not fun waiting in the bushes for half an hour, but it is what it is.
---
Are you using Imperfect Ultrawide?
---
Yeaaa.. How about no, since apperently telling my own experiences and personal opinions from the game gets you downvoated.
---
I missed that. It means there isn't a direct line of sight between the two end points. Build one of those small power poles and move it around. This will solve the issue.
---
Thank you!
---
Dude I’ve posted and commented on here so many times but people just don’t seem to listen. Since patch 7, they added in this “one-shot” nerf, and that has ruined melee as a class.
---
You do almost no damage multiple times per encounter, making melee worthless in PvP. 
---
Happens all the time and this hasn’t been addressed since survival was added in.
---
It happens in and out of vats, and happens to NPCs too. It’s horrible. They should reverse the change. It’s unclear if it’s doing less damage due to the nerf to the point of nothing, or if it’s a problem with hit connectivity.
---
I’m going with connectivity due to the fact it doesn’t even fill up your crit bar when nothing happens
---
Maybe it was a mod for the assaultron head?
---
Latest update to my issue, every 10th to 15th try I get a connection time out.
---
These are also tacked to the boards in train stations. Found this side quest at the lewisburg station.
---
Apart from Mods, unfortunately
---
I mean my melee weapons are not even connecting on ANYTHING.
---
:') you're still convinced they are trying to please you, aren't you?
---
Imposter assaultron head I think is a new skin that's coming out in the Atomic shop, so you'll likely have to unlock it from there. It probably just also gave the ability to craft it once it actually becomes available from Atomic Shop. Probably still going to have to spend atoms to get the ability to change the skin.
---
Yea. I got steamrolled alot but damn that was fun. Walls of eye bombs equal instadeath.
---
You can rename shit now? Does that include power armor chassis?
---
Ow ow, oh yeah.
---
Getting ready to enter game.  GT k9mpsgt
---
I like it. I just can't find my free sheepsquatch poster. Can't find it anywhere.
---
How about just basic facts like how many people were with you or what the level/name of the boss was???
---
Or are you afraid of getting downvoted for provable facts
---
Im gonna vendor it for that reason, worthless junk to me
---
I do.  Forces me to approach the game completely differently.
---
Outside of survival I have a natural inclination to spend half my points on strength and hoof it around the wasteland selling blackberries all day.
---
Explain how its an oversight.
---
I agree. This might be the best patch yet. Even regardless of the new content, we can now finally rename stuff, no more having to guess which Power Armor Frame is the one you want, we got a lot of nice improvements, Turrets are now usefull, vendor cap consolidation and the new vendors in the mall in Whitespring are all awesome new additions. 
---
Yeah sure, not getting Player Vending is a bummer, but at least they actually communicated it to us, told us about it and why. I'm fine with it. If it needs more work then put more work into it. As long as they actually talk to us a setback here and there is no big deal.
---
didn't you get it from BOS quest?
---
I don't mind the fight so much as the loot; the fight was fun, but getting a Ghoul Slayer's Sickle from a three-star legendary that it took 10 or so people 5-10 minutes to bring down with brute force is less fun
---
I'm not a high level or a role player, I just like the glow effect. I pair it with an assaultron helmet, marine wetsuit and shadowed combat armo...it looks super cute!
---
You’re an idiot and far too literal. The issue with melee right now is not that it’s doing less damage than a bullet anyway. It’s that more than half your swings do no damage. 
---
Going to say in modern combat a man-sized hammer to the face doesn’t do anything?
---
there's "hard" then there's being 1 shotted at level 160 in Power armor. i'm all for difficult content, and i'm sure this one is very doable but artificially making things ridiculously overpowered isn't any more entertaining than making things insanely easy.
---
95% of these guys use handmade rifles, I wouldn't call them snipers.
---
Yeah. Might be the best patch yet. So many things i wanted. This is really great.
---
Marine Tactical Helmets still sell for around 30 caps and are craftable, but rare
---
Its only limited time up so better rush and spend real money on it as its intended all along :\^)
---
I had massive trouble getting mine to actually place, kept saying it was blocked so I think the collision is fucked on them too, I eventually got it after about 10 minutes and a different bit of floor
---
All my equipped armor or armor I want to keep is labeled 01., 02., 03., etc.  
---
but I might just name them all with zs and stuff to drop them to the bottom.
---
Nice! Quality info here. I’ll make sure to edit this post with the new information when I get home. Good looking out
---
Everyone is alcoholic mystery hunters now
---
How long does the event last or is it permanent
---
I haven't done the side quests yet (and the event neither. It's really annoying server hopping trying to find a terminal that can be used), but I have to say that the ending of the *'main quest'* was very disappointing.
---
I didn't have any complain while I was doing the quest. Well, 99% of it was *'go there and read 3 notes, now go to that other place and read other 3 notes...'*, but it was fun after all. The notes were OK, the story was interesting... I was even writting notes in a notebook! And then I arrived to the ambush site...
---
I read the terminal... says how it works... *'Yeah, let's do it!'* I tought. I exit the terminal and the quest has disappeared... No reward, no notification... nothing. *'It can't end like that'...* But yeah, that's how it ends.
---
And yes, I know there's an event (and people say that is really tough), but I can't even start it...
---
In my opinion, this quest was really poor executed.
---
What event is this? Haven't been on yet and wont be on till Friday, sounds fun!
---
Not only that, they are complaining about people stealing items from vendor inventories... vendor inventories that are instanced per player...
---
Not when it costs 2k to restart it wouldn't.
---
I think that’s why he said “probably”
---
And yet armour packs. 
---
(Unless they sorted that without my knowing in which case right on)
---
ones at whitesprings had no mods for me.
---
I got a 1* ghoul slayers handmade from it ...  ....  ... kill me
---
It's called "Cryptide". You will get to it at the end of the new questline. Just get the "Sheepsquatch ate my brother" Poster from the Atom Shop (It's free), put it up in your camp, interact with it, and that gives you a questline. Doing it will lead you to the place of the new event at the end. And give you some neat rewards on the way too.
---
&gt;Note: The event has a cool down which is leaving people wondering why nothing happens at the end. I had to server hop to get a terminal I could activate to trigger the event. Its live Evan all over again.
---
That's really no different than the silos having a cool down before you can launch another nuke. It's just everybody is trying to rush through this at the same time right now because it's new.  Things will settle down, probably.
---
Handmade rocks, especially furious.  The DPS outruns everything else.  I regularly snipe with my handmade for this reason.  
---
I don’t pvp, so there’s that, but I understand why.
---
got like 60 caps for it when i sold that junk
---
What platform? I am pc. Want shocks.
---
Why not just store it till later, oh wait nevermind its 13.75 so just toss it.
---
Definitely the assaultron does the most damage. The other robots are just nuisances in comparison
---
?! Look at that PA! Shut up and take my money already! Finally to spend these Atoms!
---
I'm a bit discouraged if it's the boss battle that leads to getting these.  5 attempts, 5 fails so far.  Sigh.
---
Different event. This is at the end of sheepsquatch quest.
---
Xbox :/
---
The issues I listed are all from this update. Servers are running like crap. Another bug I know of is the atom shop wastland camo paints. I went to paint a t51b to nuka cola and noticed I was able to make a wastland camo paint on all objects but the helmet. I have no idea how it's related to server instability but it's another issue I've experienced in game today.
---
Would try to ask them to make it upgradable but currently busy.... (doing this off phone, literally got fixer, saw it wasn’t upgradable and now on my night shift)
---
Except it’s completely guesswork that they would even be observing something like that.
---
Unless the definition of probably has changed?
---
It looks great
---
Why would I store it? I'm not going down in level
---
I tried using different floors and different moving them away but they still stacked. I have no clue how to refund on the atomic store either. I just have to hope it gets fixed by the looks of things.
---
This update has messed a few things up for me. I also lost a piece of armour I always wear and my chest piece some how lost it’s deep pocketed mod.
---
Its improved quite a lot
---
So there ARE side quests after you do all the other ones involving finding wolf?  Or are those the ones you mean....
---
No it's a jacked up "Fisto" in a 3* Assaultron body fisting everyone repeatedly. This fight is painful.
---
They all do at their regular locations. Just verifying all this now.
---
Encryptid, Sheepsquatch event
---
Big agree on Toxic Valley needing more love. I feel like it will ok once the vault behind the crashed space station opens but still a unique vendor would be awesome.
---
Wow you're the first person to pick up on this
---
Do u ever sell any blackberries?
---
Ah ok cool ty
---
How ever else these plans are available they should guarantee one drops as part of the reward for Big Game Hunt at Black Bear Lodge.
---
figured the reg locations did
---
I think what you really mean is having a "car show" with all your power armor until you find the one you're looking for
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
Well if you get rid of it, like the voice of set.... your likely not going to get it again.
---
Took me ages to find it lmao
---
It's under wall decorations l
---
I thought reddit was where we went to be insulted.
---
 B E R R Y  M E N T A T S
---
Is there any progress on fixing the bug where one of your selected weapons is deselected randomly? It seems consistent with the player picking up a weapon of the same type, but I've had it happen without that before.
---
I'm really tired of expecting to pull out a weapon and then bringing up my fists.
---
&gt;item renaming
---
Yea
---
It's sad really, as I was really hoping to start the new quest today. But it just seems I will have to wait until they release a hotfix for it or the servers calm down a bit.
---
Cant remember what is this?
---
Only one or two? Most are so quickly done they are a steal, some need you to be prepared. I mostly get all of them in my play session, but sometimes have to skip one. I was lucky to have 50 bottles of booze in my inventory the other day, yet I could never find a chicken this time around (gave up after server hopping the usual places for half an hour or so, not worth my time then, I think). 
---
I also got the Camo bundle, which brought me down to 200 atoms, but I'm already back at 1100 today (I cheesed some of the 'mod armor' challenges to be honest, the camo skins came in handy for that purpose with a cost of 1 oil to apply...), and of course you can consider 1000 of those 1100 to be gone after I logged in. And if I can't slaughter enough robots soon enough, the next limited PA skin will see me handing out cash to the devs for the first time since the B.E.T.A.. Which is okay to do after my 650 hours worth of playtime, I figure.
---
Yes, it was mentioned in the latest Inside the Vault.
---
Mostly just to the vendors.  I plant a ton of them in my camp.  Between that and savage divide I always have a bunch to sell.
---
Now I guess with the update I won't have to travel all around, just to Whitespring.  Kind of limits the usefulness of my Blackberry Mule build.
---
Sob sob, finally had the top hat plan few days ago after a total like 7 hours of server hoping...
---
  Was happy that finally i would make money in game to be able to purchase those mutation serum and power armors plan well seems going back to zero and have to farms glowing meat and glowing blood after nuclear explosion.
---
Yea. And he forget to mention that they cost more materials to make now......😉😉
---
They posted a week ago that player vending was pushed back by a week.
---
Did it once, we killed it.
---
Where can you purchase it ?
---
That never works for me, do you have to be totally unarmed?
---
I saw in another thread where someone said selling top hats was an exploit. So the definition of 'exploit' is anything that makes the game less of a grind?
---
Do they sell good?
---
I woudln't need it again? Its still gonna be level 30, and its still not very good in terms of a legendary
---
Submit a ticket to the bethesda site
---
Agree, I'm gonna try in a few hours and see if I can get further but won't hold my breath. No reason why their servers are hot trash currently but I'm seeing many post about stability. I hope you can get a working server.
---
Unless Bethesda comes out and says exactly why everything is guesswork. 
---
I can see the argument to be made. Decreasing player base (compared to launch) and an increased need to keep people interested in the atom shop. Challenge is too hard? Fuck it, buy some atoms. It’s the entire philosophy of mobile gaming.
---
I had to do the same. I had to see how "bad" it really was hyped. I dont get it, i love this game and has serious potential. And after eso went from bad to great (even though Zenimax) i feel this game will go the same route
---
There is a Gorilla?  A Gorilla!?!? Whens the last time you've seen one of those swinging around Appalachia?
---
Ok thanks I will try to do that now.
---
Beat me too it😂
---
Hmm.  Sale ends Saturday (I am out-of-town)?
---
How did you get the plans for it? Is it random chance on completing the quest?
---
Me: The intention to sell Repair Kits may lead to a dramatic change in the Atom economy...
---
Everyone: just play the game and earn atoms through challenges it's not hard 
---
Me: but what if they change how hard the challenges are?
---
Everyone: INCONCEIVABLE!
---
Finding a better stealth based legendary rifle is not a easy as you think.
---
Does it count as auto rifle or regular rifle?
---
I agree it will get better, especially after people use their free card as getting another looks to be expensive. My point was people were scratching their heads as they followed the quest and it ended ubruptly. Most people don't properly read the terminal which made it obvious to me why nothing triggered. The is also no obvious way to check how long you will have to wait, at least you can check the state of silos.
---
To be clear, I think its a good event so not knocking it in that sense, it's just a but of a confusing free for all right now.
---
Checked it, cant mod the gun at all
---
Just be over encumbered for the event, I took my trouble shooters with me after I realized what was going on about 2 deaths in, fast travelled to my camp, got my troubleshooters armour, fast travelled back to the event, jumped on the roof and explosive minigunned it
---
I know it would hamper profits but explaining how you got it would really benefit the community.
---
That makes sense, since the beer keg is in the game as well
---
It was named legendary imposter sheepsquatch, level 70 i believe. Three stars. There was first a period were everyone was getting wrecked by eyebot bombs and i think 2 legendary Gutsy's before everyone realised they needed to be destroyd fast. Boss ran around invisible and apparently immune to damage while pylons were "acquiring targets", what ever that meant. After that the pylons became active (by players clicking them or auto) which made the boss appear and vulnerable to damage. Those players that took pylons seemed to take shitloads of damage and if i saw correctly once there was a pylon that was not taken by players boss went back to been invisible. Me and other ranged people jumped to roof of the hut that is in the area and just kept firing from there. I died 3 times by getting aggro and eyebeamed to oblivion. There was maybe 2-3 cycles like this and boss died. Oh and there were maybe 8-10 people. Dying respawned you right on top of the fight.
---
I think it has to be spawned in by a player at the end of the questline
---
I hope they have a community vote on things to bring back, not random elites no one wants
---
I only got a White-Wolf-Fedora, did anyone got more? Like a suit for it?
---
I did the same thing lol
---
They already did, the hats are barely profitable anymore, so ppl are just getting rid of it
---
I’ve heard people getting it from graham
---
A week? More like a month lol it’ll out patch 9 when ever upwards starts (which brings in backpack)
---
&gt; I would have spent 10-30 hours grinding
---
Server time costs Bethesda money. Would you have spent any actual money during this time grinding? 
---
&gt; They just want the easy money
---
Was that so hard to do ... now I mostly believe you
---
Server hop works too
---
Then stop being so damn pessimistic. Why even play 76 if your view defaults to negativity?
---
At launch this sub and the Bethesda sub were a tidal wave of assholes demanding the game be shut down completely. Even worse spamming and negativity than the recent idiotic rage over repair kits. Yet, they’re still adding free new content. They haven’t charged for any of it. They left in a way to earn atoms every day. They didn’t make any items cash only. There are PLENTY of ways they could have gone if they were really purely trying to make people buy atom. Yet they haven’t.

Message huckinfomo on PS4. His twisted barrel shop is the best shop I’ve seen on PS4

I ran into a level 15 in Watoga yesterday, turned out to be a 9yr old exploring dads game while on spring break.

Robot building station, FO4 automaton dlc

Reward Spoiler!!!
---
&gt;!I only got a White-Wolf-Fedora, did anyone got more? Like a suit for it?!&lt;
---
Killed the fake sheepsquatch. It gave the plans after the event.
---
They already said they will implement pacifist that will take 0 damage soon if turned on
---
Ya faction stuff is fine, I do enjoy the broader options it brings for characters. But screw karma lol
---
Random chance after doing the event.
---
Most vendors sell it
---
That blows was really looking forward to three star legendary three star loot. Maybe a future patch.
---
That's not all, they frequently miss tonnes of smaller things off the patch notes and honestly it really irks me.
---
For example, now when you alphabetise plans in a shop, the (known) tag is ignored for the ordering, so it's literally just harder to visually identify plans you don't know.
---
Especially after farming Whitesprings after a nuke or after killing the scorchbeast queen
---
I put an asterisk before all my gear and guns so when it's sorted alphabetically I know not to fuck with the stuff at the top.
---
Huckinfomo is PSN ID?
---
In FF XIV, when new Hard/Ultimate trials and raids come out, there's a race by all the hard care raid teams to get the world first clear. It usually takes days or weeks of these teams grinding these single fights for 8+ hours a day, figuring out the strategies so they can progress the fight a little further each time. Let's get some of that kind of difficulty.
---
this also means you'll be overestimated, so instead of just running up and shooting you, a high level player might actually sneak around, open with a high damage weapon then switch to something to finish you off and leave you with no chance whatsoever. Youll probably die in both situations, but at least you have a better chance when youre being underestimated
---
This is way to detailed to not be something that happened to you
---
I hate it, it's been the same since Fallout 3. I've done it a thousand+ times and find it just tedious. I guess three possibilities, find the brackets, then if they don't give you a "Tries Reset" I back out and start again with the same process. If I really can't be bothered I just guess the top three, back out and try again. 
---
Only try to get it on your last try if the previous one gives you about 5 or 4 matches with the possible word.
---
They need a new hacking minigame, for sure.
---
Amazed how everyone post about this on here, but not once came across previous post stating anger how it was pushed back. Do we only hop on Reddit when patch drops without reading or looking up anything?
---
Server time costs bethesda money but they limit the daily caps you can earn so we all have to log in daily. They want us here daily so they can sell us stuff so why not give us a reason to be here that also causes us to want to spend money?
---
There's a dead roach, wearing a Top Hat and holding a cane, posed on a toilet in a ruined house, and in its inventory there's a wedding ring. The house is near Camden park, on the road leading to the park, to the north I believe but don't quote me on that part lol
---
Ok maybe I'm dumb but i just listened to the behavioral adjustment log where Calvin dies and the quest prompt is to check the terminal to see where he went next. Which terminal? There's no marker or anything? What now?
---
Challenging yes, but the rewards better be worth the excessive use of my aid items.
---
dont get me wrong it is a decent weapon I have a 3\* radium rifle that I use occasionally but its just not worth scraping 200 rifles just to get all the mods.
---
Just tell him pepper sent u, I’ll keep that karma goin
---
Encryptid, you fight an extremely overpowered level 70 3 star legendary assaultron that's been reprogrammed to attract real sheepsqautches, it baas, has fake wool, is invisible, has a shield that needs to be taken down via 3 pylons, and an army of robots.
---
A week or so back I did a nuke zone run for flux supplies fighting everything I came across including at one point a level 50 Glowing Diseased (third adjective I can't remember) Mirelurk Queen at the same time as two level 80 Scorchbeats. No problem. I leave the area and almost get my ass handed to me by a lone level 40 something Assaultron Dominator.
---
Doesn't look like it. Very happy with this patch otherwise. I certainly hope that gets fixed before repair kits. That would be gauche.
---
If you claimed the poster while it was free in the Atom Shop you should be able to restart it at least.
---
OMG! I WANT THE PLUSHY BUNNY! If they don't make a real  Plushie Sheepsquatch  i will be unhappy! ITS SO FLUFFY!
---
I'd bet its happened to a majority
---
It honestly didn't feel hard, it felt easy. Thats why i wrote what i did above. But like i said in another post we might have gotten lucky with good damage people etc. since people are complaining and calling it impossible.
---
Yes those are the ones. The main quest just links to the actual Cryptid even I believe.
---
I think the event is bugged, first time I completed it I grabbed one pylon and barely lost any health, ended up beating in pretty quick. Second time I attempted it, grabbing one pylon nukes my health, I also noticed, that dying and grabbing the pylon again makes the game think you have two and pretty much wipes you. We couldn't beat it as me and the other two guys couldn't hold it long enough to do any damage. Wasted 60 stimpacts just to fail.
---
Yeah sorry, I meant by a patch and wrote by a week.
---
Ya after you're high enough level to grab both Starched Genes, go on one of the Market subreddits and you can buy Mutation Serums for a couple hundred caps a piece. Otherwise they cost waaay more at the Enclave bunker.
---
As far as I know there was none present but I might be wrong did update add some ?
---
Scout armor comes has legendaries, I have a legendary chest piece
---
The event is pretty easy with a group of people that knows what they're doing
---
Fucking A...ok 😔
---
Yeah its no different than killing any other 3 star legendary creature in terms of a loot drop, just that your gonna die a lot doing it
---
Or msg kernon_17, his shop is rly good and expansive aswell
---
Yeah that and the new dungeon got pushed back too.
---
Whoops. My bad. My eyes read EVENT, but my brain read Quest, LoL. Sorry about that 😂
---
Lol it’s all good, don’t want to get others hopes up when they wait for next week and still no vending
---
I share your concerns. And with potential atom shop items having real gameplay benefits, they have a *financial incentive* to stealth nerf things...
---
Damn, I wonder if you can craft level 50 versions with it, and also how rare is it. You may have just found the fallout equivalent of the imperial style motif.
---
Luckily I completed it but maybe it’s a glitch
---
Tried that, it's the second quest that's vanished for me now, was there anything i missed at the end of said quest?
---
Could some lovely individual tell me if they fixed stealth after it was broken a couple months ago? It's the only way I play and I've been waiting for it to be fixed to hop back on.
---
What? The basic stairs are one tile too?
---
zzzzzzzzzzzzzz
---
Now would have been such a great time to implement 3*** enemy 3*** loot. Missed opportunity on there part for sure.
---
If non legendary fouls at white springs can drop legendaries, I think legendaries should have a guaranteed drop
---
So wait I offer a reasonable explanation and your first response is to attack me? Lol ok. 
---
Repair kits are steps towards pay to win. I don’t do survival and I play solo so they don’t bother me. But they do set a precedence that I don’t care for in gaming. When it was cosmetics that was fine. But adding in things to affect gameplay? That’s paying to win. 
---
I would hope they wouldn’t charge for any of it. That’s the point of an MMO. Continually rolling out content for free subsidized by people spending real money in the atomic shop. Most of the patches should be free because the game was unplayable in its launch state. 
---
It’s bullshit that anytime somebody says *anything* critical that now this subreddit’s response is to attack them.
---
Yeah, hopefully they do work if not only thing to do is wait. Hopefully you can get a good server as well.
---
It's simple, but you've got this weird idea going on that it's somehow our responsibility to fix the problem. They created the situation when they released 76 in a poor state that led to low sales.
---
And yea, announcing paid DLC would lead to complaining because that would also be a broken promise. They promised free DLC. And you're in an ultra minority if you think a subscription model for this game would ever work... it is in no way worth a monthly sub, and the sub model is basically dead in the West anyway. xD
---
Ultimately, Bethesda will do what they will... and will reap the consequences of those actions. If they choose to break promises to cover their failure to release a polished, stable game, they will be known as a company that not only sells sub-par products, but also as a company that lies to and disrespects its playerbase. And I would consider that a fair judgement.
---
I understand your desire to help the game but this has been one of the silliest convos I've had about 76, TBH. You've come into the discussion ass backwards-- what you should be doing is asking yourself how Bethesda is going to make good on their promises to people who bought the game despite its problems... not asking those loyal purchasers how they're going to save Bethesda from itself. 
---
I would rather see them pull the plug than abandon responsibility for their mess and become a studio with no integrity that can't be trusted. I don't love this game *that* much... frankly, I would never love any game enough to let the studio ram me up the backside because they're unable to think of fair ways to recover from their blunders.
---
i dont think ive seen more than 10 people enter hunter/hunted since beta, and never at the same time
---
Wow. I never thought of it that way... Very good point on the jetpack
---
Yep, I get it now lol. Kind of bummed about the sheepsquatch quest, wished it was more "discover the secrets of the wasteland" and less "grind a super hard event against robots".
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdtfR5Ihw3w&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdtfR5Ihw3w&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
Yup! I'd recommend doing the quests asap, very fun. Along the way you pick up a couple (everyone seems to get the same) but there's like 40 more to unlock
---
I honestly have no idea. I thought it was a common drop until I kept getting fedoras during the event so I assumed it was a rare drop. So I posted here for offers
---
They are still profitable, people are just overreacting.  The base value for the materials used if sold to a vendor is 7.8 caps per hat. The base value of the hat is 50 caps. no matter what your Cha and perks, the hat is more profitable than selling the cloth and leather to the vendor as bulk.
---
Had a lot of fun. Sure went through the stimpaks!
---
Just found out the _ symbol puts things to the bottom, might look better than Zs. It’s all preference though.
---
Well actually one person can activate multiple pylons.
---
The problem I have is that as soon as one of the people that is charging the conduit dies than you have to charge them up again.
---
What’s the glitch?
---
Related subject...anyone else not able to repair their weapons now? :/
---
You should get it if you want
---
So you check in and look at the shop. It works too.  I like the items, I splurge once in a while and get some meaningless digital item that causes me to be happy.  Win-win
---
Its not 50 caps lmao, it comes out to 13 caps with hard bargain. Considering having to get mats its not really very worth it
---
What’s your PSN?
---
Saw him once. I
---
Insulated me so i shot him and he dropped nothing. But im ready he drops legendary weapons,  is that true?
---
Nice. I’ll probably do that, then. It would definitely look better.
---
Sure, you can use that paid repair kit to repair your weapon back to 100% in the middle of the sbq fight. Or you can run 5 seconds over to the shack, swap my perks, and repair your weapons to 200% using the workbench. So, you save 30 seconds and get half the benefit--really less than half, since repairing to only 100% doesn't give you boosted damage like over-repairing does.
---
So if that's the kind of advantage you get by "paying to win," I'm totally fine with it.
---
So this game is rated M...so people who pay it are supposed to be adults. Adults have jobs. Adults have money. And adults understand needs vs luxury, and also common vs premium.   
---
Many younger people aren't taught this concept these days. They believe 60$ entitles an infinite continuance of content. When, if you remember games in the 90s, you got what you paid for. The game was done. We always wanted more FFVII...but we didn't believe Squaresoft (yes I said that right) would release extra content disks and mail them to us for free to expand the game. We would have been laughingstocks to even suggest it, like the company OWED us more for their creation. The entitlements that filled the next decade and a half have brought us to this point, and people seem to think that they deserve it all more than a company genuinely trying to improve the experience of a game, and the fans.  
---
No, this is a recent misconception. Things cost more for better quality. If I drive a crappy car, and I want better, I go buy one. I don't have to settle for a bike, or clunker, I can get something nice. Premium. If my TV is trash, and I want 4k, I can buy it. I can settle for 720p or 1080p as well. Premium, but still in tiers. The more you want, the more it costs. This is also coming from someone who dropped 1500 on a 42" Sharp 1080p TV in 2007 just in time for them to drop to 500 in 2008. lol (kms)  
---
So here we are. The battle of FTP vs PTW...only it's not. It's Free vs Premium. NOTHING announced here will cause you to not beat the game if you don't buy it. Wont even really help you do it faster. It's more Free to Play vs Pay for PREMIUM. Can you afford the nicer things like skins and a kit to help you our here and there? Why the hell not? I have a full time corporate job. I don't have time for games most of the time. My time literally is money, and if I can get more for it, i will. Why not? I'm not "winning" over anyone else. Hell, a few 9 year-olds that don't have to do much so far (except play M games) are likely to kick my ass in Survival regularly. It's why I don't play COD anymore. i don't have time to get flamed by a kid who hasn't had their...ahem...nevermind. So why shouldn't I be able to spend my money on what makes me happy? If I buy a repair kit, it wont affect anyone else. It's not going to give me the edge. I didn't pay to win. I just bought some QOL enhancements like trading in an Escalade for a Prius. If I enjoy it, it affect me, not you!  
---
I truly think all the whining about PTW is just to whine, or Karma farm with others looking to do the same. If you really want that, there are political subs where you can say a nasty comment about someone and get thousands of upvotes. There were plenty of people who said "I'm leaving!" to which we are all better off since they left. "Bye Felicia!" None of this is Pay to Win, because we can all play, and win, without the money. But if we like to have some extra fun for a premium, why not? It's just a choice. I have the ability to do so, so I'm going to enjoy it.  
---
...now if there's ever places you can't win without the premiums, that's a TOTALLY different story. But until that happens, just enjoy.
---
Worthy changes.  I havent played in a few weeks. But naming my gear, the vats change, and the vender changes will be enough to bring me back. kudos. p.s. nix the repair kits.
---
Same here. It wouldn't start for me.
---
It’s fun as hell what the shit are you talking about. Are you level 20? Finally something fun for higher levels
---
I also counts as armor for the chameleon mutation
---
Sheep do not approve of the new beast.  By I sure do
---
Nah, I still play and enjoy this game and I thought that shit was funny as fuck
---
You forgot the fur and baaaing.
---
Bought it 3 seconds after logging in this morning. Wearing in 1 min after purchase. Looks Awesome. Have 275 atoms left. Will buy Atoms if they keep this up. Now for mg42 &amp; Gatling please.
---
Well two guys killed me and took my workshop yesterday. And the thing kept spawning me back there. And they kept killing me. And taking caps each time. I was so pissed. Cos it was two of them
---
 It’s fun as hell
---
Lots of things to do, no noticeable lag(if you’ve got decent WiFi) , balance changes,  and bug fixes. It’s become my favorite game.
---
Did you get plans from looting the sheepsquatch or was an event reward
---
BYE! Have a good time now!
---
Well workshops are an invite for pvp, theyre just playing the game as intended, not much there to fix, if you arent someone too into pvp, workshops are a no go
---
I was gonna respond to the first comment but it's not even worth it lol. You're braver than me.
---
Maybe if the critical comments made sense they wouldn’t be “attacked”.
---
Repair kits don’t heal you. No one goes into pvp with the single goal of breaking weapons and armor. How exactly does a repair kit help you win anything?
---
If you want to be critical, pick a topic that actually has a real standing like server stability. 
---
You don’t get to make shit up then get mad when you’re called on it. No one attacks anyone who posts legit issues. Calling repair kits p2w is just a desperate ploy to bitch about something. They aren’t even in game yet and somehow you’re an expert on their effect?
---
Yeah. Ok.
---
I’ve done the new event twice (one failed, one successful) and I went through my entire hitherto-believed inexhaustible stack of Stimpacks. Those events are not to be trifled with.
---
Nice, lets hope the game come together. The road map they put out looks cool.
---
You could ask him politely to leave and if he doesn't give him some brahim meat and that'll do the trick
---
I got the ring off the cockroach in the bathroom, you?
---
I think that upon completion of the event everyone who had one in their inventory loses it. I completed the event right before I finished the quest, so when I got to that part my card was missing. 
---
With how expensive a second card is, because of the time delay between uses and the fact that every participant loses one each time, you'd expect some high end rewards for completing it. All I got when I did it was a sheep helmet and a 1 star. Hopefully they improve the loot drops, as if they did it would be like how destiny handle certain events where you need keys but you get really good loot after
---
Check wall decor there are a lot to get
---
Someone's awfully salty about their hats... (not like you didn't have a ton of junk to sell for the 1400 caps without crafting a bunch of hats anyway).
---
Where do you buy it?
---
I bet they were LITERALLY SHAKING!  
---
Two shots one round used
---
Event reward.
---
Took me a notepad and 30 mins to finally understand it when I first played fallout 3
---
Welcome! It is definitely the most friendly gaming community I’ve seen.  The rough start really pushed lots of whiners, grieferers, and just impatient people away.  I’ve been here since the beta and have loved how well each change is made.  It’s grown with content tenfold since release.
---
Yeah, that might just be the case haha too early to tell if it's bugged or working as intended.
---
Yes it requires 5 cloth now.
---
Yes, exactly, I carry them weighing 1 pound instead of 10+ in the stash
---
I wonder if Vanguard leather armor pieces will be the new meta.
---
Are there unique rewards for completion?  I haven't finished the questline yet.
---
Vendors are selling it.
---
Ok!
---
3 rubber, 1 glass, 1 plastic. At least it was pre-patch. Don't know what it is now.
---
Probably because of a cooldown, which shouldn't exist
---
I wish they would roam around the white springs, and have daily guaranteed legendaries
---
Correct.  It is no longer worth the effort.
---
I think the sheepsquatch randomly appears in places, like the other cryptids that don't have specific spawn points (like Mothman)
---
Yeah thats the only one.
---
I always named stuff "AA RIGHT arm"  "AA chest" in FO4 so that it would automatically be put at the top of the list
---
Main quest or the ones you pick on the wall of clues? I just started it.
---
Free card? I didnt get one
---
There is no pay to win. Premium content doesn't help you win in 90% of cases. Your panicking is what makes the sub hilarious
---
I recently bought a used copy for Xbox and I’m also really enjoying it. 
---
Feels like Fallout NV meets Rust. 
---
Not a perfect game but really fun and it’s still being improved on.
---
I'm sure the sock market will react accordingly to your shares dumping...
---
Is there any endgame use for T-45?
---
I thought so. I don't see that one either. I'll try again later.
---
Only on sale 4 days. Will buy all the cool looking armor sets for excavator.
---
That's literally the only one, and it's just a quest reward.
---
Getting that many caps for 1 cloth was way too much.
---
They're not grouping all the vendors in one place, they're just adding a couple to Whitespring.  And no reason to only go there to sell stuff since all vendors will have the same caps pool.
---
&gt; This patch is a fail
---
Oh come on.
---
Im at the same, i think its an accidentally added quest for the pioneer scouts questline
---
I actually had a BE Handmade drop for me lastnight but it was level 25...no use to me whatsoever....maybe Legendary vendor will let me level it to 45?
---
Another guy also said this,but i just started the hole thing and i have over 4 places to be.....the second is not very clear.
---
Thank you for the welcome, and I'm happy to hear the game is coming along. I'm also very stoked about the community. I am a PVPer at heart but we'll see how it goes. Coming from Ark and Conan Exiles this is very different. I am excited.
---
It was good while it lasted.  Probably got at least 40k caps out of top hats and was able to stockpile plastic since I wasn't bulking junk to vendor or making marine helmets during that time.  It was bound to get nerfed sooner or later...  With player vending coming, the obvious thing to do seemed like putting hats in a vending box near a train station and selling them wholesale for like 10-15c/ea. to players without the plan.
---
If you got the brewing station and fermenter then I think that's everything. It's been a while since I've done it myself so I'm not certain
---
Used them to walk on water at my CAMP. Now I get parasites again.   :(
---
Even in French this helped.  Cheers ears
---
Main one, once you leave that hoyse
---
You need to find and use better plans to make and sell better items.  Witch or Skeleton costumes, or even make and sell serums.
---
Not sure, but quite a bit of quests seem to be missing
---
Nice coming from Ark and Conan Exiles I'm used to playing games that are currently being worked on LOL
---
The VATS targeting fix is a gigantic QoL improvement for me.
---
Item renaming made my weapons and armor lists so much more tidy.  All my worn armor is now "zz-left arm" and "zz-chest plate" so it all sits at the bottom of the list.  Same with my weapons, which all have W names.  Whippersnapper (lever gun), White Russian (handmade) and Whole Hog (bowie knife).
---
Please hold. Wait. Please hold.
---
Is all he would say to me :(
---
Thats what i thought, but it all just dead ends at the encryptid event
---
You’re saying guns that tend to break faster (automatic weapons and such) won’t give people an advantage who can fix them without having to find all the resources? Lol
---
I’d love to bring up server stability but I’m afraid you’d have a meltdown if I mentioned more than one negative thing like an asshole. 
---
I made literally nothing up. I expressed I can see where the OP is coming from and that I can vouch as being a case that he was referring to. You got in a tiff because I didn’t heap praise on the house that Todd Howard. built.
---
Guess we're still waiting :(
---
I like what I’m reading, too bad I won’t be able to fully enjoy all of it until Thursday
---
Good to know.
---
I had a quest to go find someones trap or something after finding his cache, but the quest has just vanished for me.
---
I’ll take that chance instead
---
Well it was going reasonable until they hit full reeeeee mode.
---
Oh!  I've seen that damn thing too.  It was so weird all I could do was take a picture of it and walk away.
---
Yea the map inside place seems so big but I was only able to get 2 side quest and even then what the hell is the main quest, it just seems to end at the event
---
The text towards the bottom keeps popping little bits here and there.
---
Renaming my shotgun "Kurt Cobain's Microphone" in honor of the best renaming in Fallout 4. It's a no-brainer.
---
I got a spare beret, every mask and some spare plans for sale if you’re on xbox
---
don't quote me on it, but I think everything added today is permanent side quests...but I'm purposely keeping myself in the dark about details
---
That's pretty much it. Good to see someone do some research. Enjoy!
---
I just like the new picnic blanket lol
---
If only I had done my research on min specs I wouldn't have had to buy it twice :(.
---
Self promoting is the worst, but heck my post about it
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bbexf7/a_good_chunk_of_questevents_seems_to_be_missing/
---
There’s 4 side quests and one main quest. It’s the second location on the main questline.
---
Do you take mirelurk meat as a form of trade for your restaurant?
---
It is unlikely someone who knows about an exploit is going to suddenly stop playing the game. All Bethesda cares about is having people log in daily so they have a chance to sell them something in the atoms store. So long as the exploit remains relatively secret they wont put forward the time or energy to patch it. Everything they do is scrutinized by the cost-benefit analysis of their shareholders and changes are not made unless it effects the games profit margins.
---
I'm not sure. Sometimes they seem to take notice when people do that. Maybe it's random...
---
What if... What if different people like different things?
---
Got to the part where i went to find someones trap or something after finding the cache in the car, but the quest has just vanished.
---
Yeah. I was wondering if it's somehow tied to our stealth.
---
I have that. What are the components to craft it?
---
I mean......if you consider a repair kit to be a pay-to-win item, you might want to give your build some more attention.
---
The only part I completed is the revive an ally objective
---
I can see the option to build them but i need the plans which i'm guessing is given at the end of my missing quest lol damn..
---
I don't get these complaints. 
---
I'll weep for those having glitches with the new quest, or that we can't examine legendary in the vendor screen, or this odd repair/renaming glitch...but somebody having to work to hit the already measly cap limit per day? Meeeeeeeeeeeeeh
---
Yeah, would be nice. Treasure maps still seems to be the best way to find the more rare plans, like crafting power armor and some other stuff.
---
A l lot of high levels like me will drop bags for lower levels to help on your journey.  Dont be afraid! Take the stuff lol. Not all of us want to shoot you. 
---
Stay in passive until you are ready to fight. I honestly stay in passive all the time. 
---
Always check overseers caches at flat wood church and the overseers camp. Stuff will be put in there all the time. Also check suitcases at rail stations. A lot of people will put ammo and aid stuff in there they don't need.
---
Thanks for the help
---
Can we call the plague "the scorching"?  I think that sounds better than "the scorched plague".
---
I personally feel the leader board needs to be scrapped altogether.
---
Half the people want it the way it is, half the people want it the way it was. I say let's get rid of it.
---
Thanks thats handy to know.
---
Do you know whether cosmetic and animation mods work under that tag?
---
Nah, Thanos kicked the hell out of nanotech armor, so I doubt some power armor would really do anything against him.
---
It's also possible that it will come later, but you need to bloody warn people about this kind of stuff.
---
People play this game???
---
I have been posting this for months on here. Holy shit way to go Bethesda. The wendigo is amazing
---
Hm. Guess we’ll be getting more sometime. Sounds like this addon wasn’t ready either but they didn’t push it back cause they already pushed back player vending.
---
I hear you, but in the last big update they added the Nuka quantum paint and put that in the game, not the shop. It would’ve been a big seller, so obviously it’s not going all atom shop. 
---
As long as they mix it up at least a little bit I’m fine. The game needs to make money, all the cool cosmetics can’t be free.
---
Complement with White Tuxedo and Fashionable Glasses.
---
Can confirm you can get level 50 versions just made mine level 50
---
You can craft a level 50 version :))
---
This is a possibility, but don't you think that Bethesda should have warned us about it ?
---
You need at least 3 ppl, 4-5 is great. And just keep goin at them. I did it first try. I like the group events like these. Working together to win is a good feeling.
---
Belloq. Christ, why do I even know that?
---
They are upgradable I also have plans to make it as level 50
---
Talk about a surprise and delight!!
---
I like the change
---
Honestly I thought the last patch we had was good, however this one blows it out of the water.
---
So glad I’m not alone in this.  
---
I logged out and back in to see if it’d change, but nothing happens.  
---
I’m so confused.
---
You are one of those don't rock the boat kinda guys. Alright, you do you.
---
I've heard that it costs caps, but how much, exactly?
---
Probably because of cooldown, which shouldn't exist
---
Notes at the factory says it makes your teeth itch... so that’s something
---
Social menu too.
---
I run with the same group over and over...doesn't matter if a lvl 20 launched it or a lvl 300 we kill it the same
---
I only run two weapons, a machine gun and main a two handed melee. Been playing survival lately so I’ve stored a bunch of non perishable foods and purified water in my stash. I sell chems I don’t need. I bulk and sell junk I don’t need. Donate plans you already know to lower levels if you’d like. 
---
Only thing I’d really suggest is to plan your perks ahead of time so that you could really get the most out of your character. 
---
Oh, and if you’re overencumbered check your junk and misc tabs ( maybe aid as well ) for things that might be heavier than you think. Gunpowder is one of these things, ore too. 
---
Good luck out there fellow dweller.
---
Assaultron
---
The new survival mode update may be what you’re looking for. It shows the top killers, and having turrets at your camp will do more to enemies.  Good luck!
---
The thing is, all the quests the guy showed are in game. It just seems like a ton of items are missing as well as no actual sheepsquatch. It just stops and im really damn confused.
---
Agreed!! Or at least, if it didnt have the metal foot bar that wraps around the bottom, you could group a few Bars together to your desired size.
---
Don't die because everybody will rush to pick up any junk you might drop.
---
Same, after i found his trap it just stopped everything. Its weird.
---
Will post a video in a few
---
Everyone is
---
I’ve followed the guidelines but the issue still persist. It only happens in FO76, not in any other games, I doubt its a psn problem. It’s a game breaking bug for me now. You can check this [video](https://youtu.be/LifU8ZbCW7U)  to see what i mean.
---
I'm a bit confused, I've done the quest (I still need to do those secondary quests) and done the event triggered at the end. I've read the different terminals and notes, and OK I've fought a fake sheepsquatch. What about the real one (the one that leaked)? What about those pins on Lucky Old Mine or Vault 51 among others? They never told anything about the quest being splitted, could it be related to the Burrows release next week?
---
Self promoting is the worst, but check my post about it
---
YES WEAPON NAMING
---
Lots of quests are missing from this dlc. At least according to data miners. I’m sure he’ll be coming in a later patch.
---
Also, be careful at workshops. You become a target for people to come one shot you. Lol 
---
Another tip, make friends! I never played online with others before this game. I love the friends I've made in here! 
---
If you're on xbox, look me up! GT kittielickie.  I'll help you get leveled!
---
Completely agree. I’m a little underwhelmed.
---
Spoiler tag! [There is a real one that was data mined in the game and sheepsquatch bone and fur found in files and even a leaked image but so far no ingame sighting](/spoiler)
---
My dream of roleplaying as goat man can finally be obtained
---
There's mounted cat heads in the taxidermy shop. 😿
---
Is it possible that the new content increased the chances for rad storms? Several people here and elsewhere have had radstorms happen today during an event so that seems likely.
---
Hey, im joining you right now. I'm still interested in the helm, but we can negotiate ingame :)
---
where is your XO1 Quantum?
---
Maybe the same place as the letters? Although i don't even know where to find those.
---
That’s how it works. It’s weird.
---
Where can I see pics of the ones that didn't appear in Fo4?  I'm not very deep into the new questline, so I only have wolf and radstag.
---
Just enough gears to build liberty prime.
---
1: I don't care about the water or the resources they produce enough that it doesn't matter, and I'm a nice guy really 
---
2: it wasn't time wasting it was fun and dying means nothing
---
Read my post. That is the base value. That then gets modified by the the percent of value for selling and then further modified by Cha and perks.
---
Same, people are still attacking it while it's invincible. I blew every single stim I had after 5 runs. AND the quest went poof.
---
Yeah probably was but was fun
---
Maybe add a 4th gun like a 10mm for low level areas after level up a bit and scrap a ton of them for the mods.. Plentiful ammo and decent fire rate
---
Whoa whoa whoa.... you mean I'm going to stop targeting my own turrets and my own Brahmin?
---
Vendors have a recall circuit board for a lot of caps.
---
Yep, you need to either wait for a unknown amount of time as of now or try your luck server hopping
---
Bethesda has spent a lot of resources over 4 months fixing tons of bugs so the bug level of the game is now at "Bethesda normal." 
---
Their QC is still for shit but at least they've made improvements. I won't preorder another BGS product again though.
---
Haha honestly
---
Done clean up kiddie corner cabins yet?
---
Oh yes, because everyone is fighting in pvp and suddenly breaking their equipment and repairing it while being shot. Are you really that desperate to bitch you even make up scenarios?
---
No one mentioned Todd Howard until you did, but thanks for confirming my point. You just want to bitch.
---
No... with max hard bargain it goes for 13 caps.. they went for 35 before. I did this often I would know lol
---
Survival is supposed to be risky. Reducing the caps penalty for being killed in PvP is now less than in adventure and the aid drop has been reduced. 
---
What's really needed is a way to deal with PvP players on survival who have 0 caps.  They kill you they get money. You kill them you get nothing. There needs to be a bankruptcy debuff that lasts until you have enough caps to cover your death.
---
it looks like event have global cooldown \~2 - 3h for server for reactivation
---
It’s an event that you’ll have to keep an eye out for I’ve been told.
---
Sadly my base would nvr fit anywhere except the exact location I am in.
---
1000 atoms too! It’s cheap and AWESOME
---
I server hopped 11 times before giving up, event like this shouldn't require that much server hopping
---
Yeah I done it a few times and only made it 1 time. It’s hard and it’s chaos but it’s a lot of fun :)
---
What the hell is the recall circuit board? I thought you just used the pylons at the even to disable its shields. I never heard of a recall circuit board
---
Firebreathers, you say? I couldnt find anything regarding that here? Did i miss something? Different post?
---
OMG.  That's hilarious, but in the worst taste imaginable.
---
Gotta buy the part to make the key card at Lewisberg station
---
You get it by doing the quests that lead you to that spot. Not sure what it's called or which pip boy tab it shows under though
---
Damn, Im on PS4. Probably spend a bit of time solo to get the controls down etc but I guess I will just see.
---
♪I got those spurs that jingle jangle♪
---
Hmm. Very weird. I did see an event called “encrypted” I think? But that was right when I started the first part of the quest. I know I need to make the assumption recall keycard, but to make it I need to buy a certain part from the new vendors in white spring and it’s 2000 caps... surely you don’t need that much to complete it. That seems absolutely rediculous.
---
first try we failed about 10+ players all lvl 100+, second time event came up bout roughly same but i noticed people actually manning a pylon and i grabbed one and kept using stimpaks to keep myself alive through the draining affect as it seemed others were doing which kept the shield off her and allowed everyone to wear her down quickly.  
---
so my advice would be to everyone if ya dont see anyone feeding a pylon and you have stimpacks get on it and keep it active, as long as youve hit the assualtron atleast once you will get xp and lgendary drop.. i got 3 star marine armor with chameleon, food reduction, +1 per, and the mascot outfit
---
It hasnt yet
---
Is this necessary even if you have the keycard?
---
That's crazy talk.
---
In some other posts it says if you remain close to the pylon you take reduced damage but with the dumb cool down I haven't been able to test it.
---
Thank you so much! It's been driving me absolutely bonkers!
---
That's why happened to me! I just stood there..... waiting for the shoe to drop. 
---
Nothing.
---
Followed me all over the place saying, "Halt!".
---
Blew his brains in with my combat shotgun, expecting a rubber chicken as loot.
---
Piss me off.
---
Same white wolf fedora and a t45 jet pack plan
---
That seems like a strange requirement for a quest regarding how expensive it is. Also, I don’t know if I want to buy it yet because I technically don’t even have the quest anymore. It is nowhere to be found in my data section
---
Shh bb it’s ok
---
Over 2000 caps... Plus flux is also needed to craft a card.
---
Most likely an issue with mods/.ini files
---
Yeah I dropped 5k on it like 2 days ago :|
---
Guess the rarity is still there, but the demand for these plans just went down to 0.
---
I think my problem is that it extends past the looks of a paint and IMO the only thing on the atom store should be paint. In any of the previous fallout games that design would have been reserved for a legendary named drop that you got after completing an entire DLC or hidden quest, but now it is just a cosmetic. 
---
Problem is, I can easily see them modifying the colors on that cosmetic to resell it at a later date and that is just lazy. If they had made it into an in game armor model they could have made as many color variations as they wanted but instead they made it a cosmetic itself. I think that was stupid and a poor business decision.
---
&gt; **Please don’t complain about the difficulty of the new event \*too quickly\*.**   
---
&gt; I haven’t played it yet 
---
Sooo.... you're speaking out of ignorance?
---
I'm so bummed about that.
---
Does he follow you around?  Is that his kitsch?
---
They don't have unique names and I'm really sad actually.
---
Belloq too, but I was thinking of the villain who dies as the freighter sinks when Indy reclaims the Cross of Coronado. All that’s left is the guy’s hat floating in front of him.
---
That's so dumb, I gave up after using up almost all of my chems in the first fight. The fight wasn't even fun it was just nonstop gutsy's and being oneshot by the imposter
---
I know I'll probably be grinding or paying to get all 4 of those. Early on one of the first mutations I got was Plague Walker and the first few places my brain went was a four horsemen Pestilence build followed by a 4 player team each playing a different horseman build though since we don't have horses they'd probably have to use differently painted power armor. It didn't go anywhere since I only play solo and wasn't good enough to come up with a single decent horsemen build, much less all four. This definitely has me thinking about horsemen build ideas again.
---
Holy hell man. I f'ing know this. ALL items have a base value. That is it. When you sell an item to a vendor you get a percentage of that base value minus or plus additional percentages based on your charisma and perks (hard bargain - which treats you cha as 9 more than it is). The only fair f'ing comparison to make that everyone knopw matter what their cha is, is to look and compare the base value changes. 
---
That being said, the f'ing base value for a top hat went from 150 caps (of which you got 32 caps) to a base value of 50. It all doesnt matter because the base value of 1 top hat IS STILL GREATER THAN THE BASE VALUE OF THE MATERIALS. Thus you will still make top hats and still sell the f'ers to the vendors, because that will net you more caps than bulking the cloth and leather and selling it that way. THE END.
---
No, because I’m telling people to hold off on making opinions about an event that might just be more complex than previous events. 
---
I’ve also ran it now, and feel pretty justified in what I said. It requires team work and it’s easy.
---
Yes I believe so. Though I think you can still join the even if someone else has started it.
---
This is pretty much my exact experience. I wanted to bash my head against the fucking ground. It really pissed me off because people were standing next to them the whole time, wasting ammo shooting it.
---
Perfect thx.
---
Quick swap worked for me last night before the patch.
---
Yeah I noted that down, it does seem to be alphabetical though. I saw plans together like broadsider, cryolator, etc even though some were known and some weren't
---
I don't think this was intended, but I lost my Rosy quest to kill the Yao Guai. The syringer has disappeared from my inventory too and Rosy won't talk to me. So you guys kinda borked my quest :(
---
The next part is the a event called Cyrptid, which if not with a full server group you will not be able to kill. And the even is timer based so once someone finishes it, you will need to wait for a unknown amount of time or try server hopping but that is also hard to find the event
---
So Warrider is an Ultracite skin?
---
Making the keycard and recalling the assualtron starts the event. Not a quest anymore, it’s already done.
---
When you get DCed, go to recently played with and it’ll have people from the server you got kicked from. Can direct join, not trying to give Beth a pass, but it’s one way to get back
---
New event?
---
It's either ultracite or 45 not entirely sure.
---
“WANNA PLAY A HAND OF CARAVAN?”
---
After every damn patch Bethesda seems to break something new.
---
Ok, strange. Is there anyway to get this keycard without spending an insane amount of money? I just lost all my caps in survival last night.
---
just make sure those gears are not made in china, for they are infected with communism
---
so the quest isnt on a timer, it costs 2k caps to start?
---
I bought a BoS suit one time. I just try to keep in mind a minority of players use Reddit and other sites to trade. Majority stick to the game itself and sell to vendors.
---
UPDATE: As mentioned [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bbeocl/psa_for_pc_users_missing_the_known_tag_on_plans/) it's a similar known bug with the addon SaveEverything that was also causing the \[Known\] tag to stop working at vendors. Remove from your INI for now!
---
Crafting the full set is kind of a right of passage in fo76 in my eyes. Once you get to endgame content, craft a set of prototype X-01.
---
I did the event once and the lead up quest part way. Got the mascot hat and a new plan for a head mounted creature.
---
Really dig it so far
---
All this new stuff and my camp budget is maxed. Time to start downsizing and make a tiny home.
---
As far as I know, new character at level 50 is the only option
---
[You killed the real one not the robot??????](/spoiler)
---
Strange. The only way to get it is spend a crap load of money? Do you have to do it each time the event happens? Can someone else just buy it and I can join the event?
---
I can understand that as well, as currently my camp is pretty specific to the location.
---
But why not have a row, or street that when we set up the camp it will only fit inside that square?  And when you log in it auto fills the next available “plot”
---
This is also breaking the fermenter functionality (you can view but not add anything).
---
No, just noticed its a component to make the keycard.
---
I get about 100 leather a day just killing all the mole rats that hound me.
---
I have the chest piece plan. I am willing to sell it if you make a good offer
---
No, although the robo companions were my favorite part of 4,  I didn't get any more nostalgic then when I saw any of the other reused assets.
---
Also, double check so the mod truly is for the super sledge. I had a mod that was driving me crazy that I could not install. Turned out to be for regular sledgehammer.
---
no, it was reward for robot event
---
It just works
---
It seems like at the time that the end of the quest is to fight the imposter but theres also 2 side quests if you read the notes on the map.
---
I know it wouldn't make sense at all, but I'd listen to a channel of Magnolia's songs from Good Neighbor.
---
I’ve done the entire thing. No all of it is in ash heap
---
Im so confused, some guy even data-mined the texture  for the model of the sheepsquatch plus more rewards.. kinda weird
---
Vats targeting fixed
---
Vendor hopping fixed
---
Community hub inserted
---
Things so small could yet so huge
---
There isn't a real sheepsquatch, the whole story is that it's a robot
---
Sorry. No way to rerun on same toon.   I am lvl 43 on my second toon without doing the quest line to get those same items.   This last weekend of double exp was a big boost.  Sometimes people have found max lvl items sold to vendors or sold by players.
---
Hello. No you cannot earn a reward quest item twice. Even if u team up at level 50 with a person who hasn’t done it, you won’t get the reward item again. 
---
With that being said, the somerset gun is pretty nice.  If that anti armor prefix is what your after, you would be better off just buying it on the market.  And most likely you will find better guns with anti armor plus more legendary effects.
---
Todd did it again
---
Sugar Grove: Loot all the fans and such from there, world hop. Rinse, repeat.
---
Or hunt muties, they occasionally drop 1 - 3 loose screws, same with Yao guai's.
---
Right? Every time I try to share rad sponge with my unyielding unarmed guy, in order to survive a nuke zone without power armor, it immediately turns off, because when my hp changes, all my stats change. Or people joining/leaving team while someone is sharing the charisma boosting perk. Or I drink something... Basically, I gave up on ever trying to share perks.
---
It really is hard but fun as a result. It definitely wants doing in a group with some charisma perks going on. It's a step in the right direction. They just need to sort the loot tables as the 3* boss is once again dropping 1* crap.
---
Not true. Dataminers have screenshots. Juicehead showed people on his last video.
---
How many people were you with you and what level. I was with people 200+ and just bitch slapped us away
---
LOL I was doing the quest and had no idea it was an event. Suddenly I triggered it and was like "Oh shit what have I done?" Luckily players swarmed and we got it down. 
---
That was fun as hell.
---
Try talking.  Helps if you got the drop on them but I usually don't shoot first unless I'm surprised.  I ask if they are going to be cool.
---
One friend I made because we kept ending up at Uranium Fever at the same time, which turns into a free for all usually.  But we built some trust.
---
My vendors had 1400 to star with. No idea what is happening on your end.
---
Met an dumbass
---
Well I’m 396, farm farm farm lol
---
So naming my gatling "The South Will Rise" is out of the question then I guess.
---
Damn...
---
PC?
---
I hadn't seen more than 2-3 since BETA, then got 2 in one day last week.  ([here's proof of at least one](https://imgur.com/Y7x8oO3))  Nothing since then.  
---
I've never placed artillery at my camp.  Is it possible to make the weather inducing ammo like in Fo4?  I remember that you could make a radstorm on demand if you wanted.  Why you'd want to, I have no idea.
---
I managed to get four, Fallout wikia is listing 6 of them. Don't know if the 2 last are in the game currently though..
---
I got a Sheepsquatch Mask.
---
Yeah I missed that one. Still envious when I see it.
---
there was a lot, but yeah it just 1-2 shot everyone
---
Jeez, that's pricy. At least all the vendors are in one place now.
---
Based on their previous short sales; yes.
---
Id' much much much prefer if they did like % off for 4 days then raised the price to a normal price permanently. I bought a blackbird skin that looks real cool a few months back in a short sale and it's never came back into the game.
---
Yeah I just beat the quest and man i'm mad i thought that after i beat the assaultron i would take something off its body or something and use it to find the real sheepsquatch but no all i got was a fedora i didn't even get that sheep hat the assaultron had that i've seen other players wearing, i'm legit pissed off i did this quest to find another cryptid not fight a bunch of robots
---
It's not an issue from a balance standpoint. Do you really think it was intended to have a method to easily and quickly max out the vendor cap pools every day through crafting a cosmetic item?
---
Its just when the game is getting good Bethesda does something to fuck it up all over again.
---
None of my vendors even had caps, I haven't traded with them for 2 days
---
I got a three star spear with little real benefit but at least I got something, lots of people failing the event.
---
Yes please, I want my ass handed to me on a silver platter from all the junk I drop while dying. I'm currently playing with almost no perks (only the animated perk cards I have and a few crafting ones, so no damage perks at all) and restricting myself to certain legendary armor. Game still feels too easy in almost any circumstance. I want something that can barely be done solo, something that requires a specialized build, maybe even min-maxing. Something that can't be cheesed with exploits and melee
---
There's no accounting for taste, bud.  Do you.
---
I didn't have 1400 either. Probably something to do with the timer for the caps. I'll check again later and see if it reset.
---
Well...if they’re addressing the problem in a few weeks I can wait/hop. But maybe. I’m on Xbox. Are you? What do you think would be fair?
---
During the event I noticed the real danger came from the Eyebomb swarms. Stay away from those guys!
---
I don't know if it's worth buying but I bought it because it looks damn cool!
---
Im good for paying 3 cloth to make 1 hat. But don't get leather involved and keep the price the same.
---
That's what you get when you play a game with a cash shop, tedium is a feature not a bug.
---
I haven't played any of the new "hard" content yet, but here is where I stand.
---
Normally, I am not a fan of content being so difficult that solo players can't experience it. The fact that I had to grind for hours in Borderlands 2 just to beat some of the DLC bosses (had nobody to play with) was simply painful and not very fun. 
---
That said, I have hope given the community present here with FO:76. I hardly ever do events alone, despite playing by myself. There always seem to be other players willing to jump into an event and try their darnedest to succeed. My hope is that translates into these new hard events, dungeons, and raids. I do worry a bit about the number of players on a server making that difficult though. The nice thing about Scorchbeast Queen fights is that pretty much anyone can show up to help, but if we are getting instanced dungeons and raids that require multiple people, that may be harder or less inviting for random people. 
---
We will have to see how things end up, especially once the initial "newness" of the content wears off.
---
People don't have opinions
---
Got any suggestions?
---
You have to come back later. Then starts a Hard Event with an invisible shephead and hundreds bots. It's realy tough and i failed really Hard by the first try.
---
But how am I going to repair it????
---
Weird... will try logging back in later to see if it was a one time thing. Thanks!
---
Yep 1st and only try today failed it.
---
Sadly I've been disconnected 3 times within the space of 15 minutes tonight. Wouldn't mind so much but I was building up my new camp location. I got 2 server disconnects and one crash to desktop in between. Checked my internet, checked updates for computer and game and everything is A-OK.  As with the O.P I ain't had this kind of issues before today's update :(
---
For the Assaultron Boss, I was thinking of using perks like Enforcer or Tormentor to cripple it's legs first, then head to stop it's laser attack. Tormentor definitely works on the queen so it should work on this one. Gotta keep those three generator things working or I think it heals tho. Crippling an assaultrons legs really ruins it's combat effectiveness and if you do it's head I'm pretty sure it can't use that laser attack either.
---
What do you lot think?
---
So I won’t be able to complete the new quest line and event with my new character. She’s only level  15. I have two level 100+ as well but was hoping to use my new one.
---
Are those the 3 star legendaries I've read about?
---
They can have 3 legendary effects on 1 weapon if I've understood correctly
---
I’ve never looted so many loot bags at a time before O.o
---
It's like an armour station you see, but its for those who use it thinking Bethesda would give me a free set of Power Armour because I bought the atom store paint, using the free atoms I earned in game.
---
That answer your question?
---
How did you manage to get them what did you look at on the map? I looked all over and was only able to read the 2 notes stuck to the map
---
What would count as excessive? I've got 650+ cans of dog food, 200 nuka cherries, and about 700 stims I can't bring myself to throw away or sell. I'm doing my damn best to use it all up. I would love something to make me actually use all these aid items
---
So lead will likely be sourced from a resource deposit that people will encompass in their C.A.M.P.
---
Screws are another matter. I like to collect the ballistic fibre from Camp McClintock, so will often also collect clipboards that are scattered arouns inside. Locations that will have desk fans or clipboards are your best bet, so think offices, schools, large complexes. 
---
Hope this helps!
---
Nope, not in the least.  2 caps a pop.
---
It’s both. Timer and keycard. You can also craft the keycard. But once the event ends you have to wait a bit to do it again
---
Lmao, that's the model of the sheepsquatch robot over a deathclaw dude. That's not at all what he is suppose to look like
---
Farm farm farm
---
caps are relatively easy to get
---
Too hard?  I found it more difficult to battle the servers without a disconnect long enough to finish the event, more than the difficulty of the fight itself.  One person stationed at each pylon worked for us fairly easily... but Me and my group had to restart 3 times until the servers stopped shitting us out mid way through.
---
I farmed and server hopped for that particular recipe for the Civil War era top hat and Bethesda just spit in my face. A weeks time poof be gone.
