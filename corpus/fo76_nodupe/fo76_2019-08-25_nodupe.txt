You should be running rejuvenated then dude!
---
Yep, not really all that useful.
---
I used 4000 rounds of 2mm and got a one star medic flamer
---
If they're the one's dropping nukes then they can have the issues as more people = longer enemy spawns. Events like this should follow the level mythos so low levels don't ruin it; under the atleast level 75 mark as thats plenty enough after 50 to have spare levels amd cards to fix your build. Events easily for a higher tier character; 99% of level 50's probably have random ass stats anyways so they wouldn't be optimal. These sortof comments are so goddamn useless since you are probably running an unyielding set which is in and of itself broken in terms of upping nearly every SPECIAL by about 15 if a full gear, even without the SPECIAL cards being used. Shut up.
---
Time for the magic question.  Have you posted this on betehsda's actual forum or submitted your account of the incident and the picture to their support?
---
My carry weight is fine.
---
8 player limit is no doubt for the lag.  If the event goes beyond 10 minutes it slows to a crawl.
---
Yeah kudos to all those bringing in materials!
---
Very confused about how everyone's talking like every person in the room has to waste 2000 rounds apparently someone could solo the event? I can't even get to this flipping thing because I have somebody fucking legendary pieces because all this game does this shit out legendary stop I don't care about and I have to wear pocketed strength plus 1 armor to even move around the goddamn map. So what am I supposed to do show up in my zero resistance hazmat suit?
---
I must be getting lucky. Got all the camp plans and it's been dead within under 10 minutes and I've not died once, no PA just melee it with a few random other people shooting.
---
I don’t know how to get out so I wait to die lol m it’s hard
---
Haha, pc master race go brrrr.
---
Yeo I just finished mine like an hour ago (just enough challenges today to get it) and I feel so free, yet I will probably be on more now if that makes any sense
---
It's so people can join, they cant get in once it's started.
---
Got to love how custom that harpoon gun is with that 40% bash. Feels like their trolling us with that one.
---
I wanted to take a screen shot, at one point it looked like an 8 bit game
---
[removed]
---
Where do you find it? I've ran out so often.
---
This. I have seen too many level 362 in power armor fool around during Encryptid while my bloodied rifleman had to take the pylons. 
---
Level is meaningless. Experience and build are everything.
---
I've failed a bunch cause people just stand around doing NOTHING and not participating to make it work...
---
Totally happened for 2 out of 3.  It seems to be tied to time the event runs.  The longer say after 10 minutes it starts to get into slideshow experience.  First event I ran on server we killed the boss in about 8 minutes and that event was fine, the rest were like 15+ minutes and it was brutal 2-5 fps 10+ minutes in each.
---
Assuming you meant ridiculous...
---
I did the event once today(PS4), and every time I threw a Nuka grenade the fps got SO BAD. It's incredibly annoying.
---
My game closed as I joined the event
---
DPS baby all day
---
Abundance of everything;)
---
Omg you uninstalled Bc of a simple setting you toggled on?  F
---
Beautiful sniping spot too
---
I've never even seen this event spawn? Does this still exists or was it limited time only.
---
o i c

https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Riding_Shotgun
---
I've gotten to do it 4 times before work and got all camp items.
---
I would've like to see the end.. It crashed at half health for me. Spawned back in outside with no way back in bummer.
---
There is no shortage of spots in the arena and along the mine shaft where you can jump and the wendigo can't hit you
---
PSA: If you face this situation, log off/server hop immediately. Even reporting may get you banned since they will likely attach your account to it.
---
Please say sike now.
---
Greed ruins the game. Kindness will always prevail
---
Amen to that. Almost like they did it on purpose lmao.
---
Exactly, this post is an alibi, nothing more.
---
Lol, it concerns me as a member of the hunters guild
---
You just have to go to big bend east and talk to Vinny, you can do it whenever as long as one of the unique caravan characters are outside. It dropped with wastelanders.
---
Thank you. 
---
I totally forgot that I was a scout as well lol.
---
I fucking fucking love that quest
---
You have to know the plans to get them as drops and you have to be lvl 20 to start the quest line.  There could be a work around, this is fo76, but a lvl 1 shouldn’t be able to pull that armor piece.
---
We didn't have any problem.  I think we were only a group of 4 or 5, one of which was me with my very non-OP lever action rifles.  I got shots on Earl at first and then focused on taking out the wendigo spawn.  I died twice during the fight and I think only one other person died just once.  We did stay spread out and Earle only scared us twice, but otherwise we made it out just fine after just a short amount of time.  Honestly, the pre-fight wait felt like it was taking longer than the actual fight.  Our fourth was wearing PA, I think, but otherwise the rest of us were wearing our normal armor.
---
Haven't been on my PC since then, but I will later.
---
When I played that quest all I could do was laugh cause they knew what they were doing.
---
I just had a fun one on PS4, somehow I was waiting to go in with a big group of people, when the rocks broke I charged in and started fighting but something seemed off. I was all alone, I looked at the map and there were tons of people there but nobody in the fight with me...I guess somehow I got my own private instance? Icing on the cake was Early was constantly clipping into the floor...and ceiling.
---
I don't understand your math, it doesn't make seem right.
---
You don't actually need to flee to the exit. It won't kill you if you stay
---
Damn good idea.
---
Try having bad internet and getting disconnected or timed out multiple times, that dam quest took me nearly 3 hrs to complete. As the dialogue was so delayed and the quest has no cheack points, you have to restart from the beginning so many times.
---
It’s wholesome in a way but other than that the rewards aren’t anything spectacular.
---
Just tried that, no luck.  Thx though.
---
What so like tons of junk?
---
I do fine with my bloodied melee.  I’ll take my swings at Earl but I stick to playing cleanup on the wendigo so the players with the big guns can shoot in piece.
---
Why don’t you play it?
---
Good thing is, your rifleman can be a commando and vice versa. It keeps things fresh. Also, archer, because of special points allocation.
---
I go commando all the time, archer when I have collected too many arrows and rifleman when I want to rock my instigating weapons during some events (like Encryptid, because no one cares about tagging there).
---
It’s an amazing opportunity to use explosives as a bloodied build. I’ve got a B25 AutoGrenade for clearing adds, and a (apparently somewhat magic *cough cough* V33 Gatling laser for burning down Earl. I can do it in less than 5 minutes depending on how lucky/unlucky I get with fears and environmental damage-&gt;death-&gt;respawn.
---
Instigating weapons will become irrelevant in one wasteland
---
Yes, it's easy to make the ammo, and the gun does tons of damage if you get a good roll.
---
It's not even a side quest is it? Maybe there's another way but I think you pretty much have to do it to follow one of the main quest lines.
---
Damn, well the difference is somewhere between consoles then. Sorry to hear an I apologize for downplaying the problem
---
I'm level 470, and I don't wanna play with someone lower than 400.
---
Who doesn’t like a barbecue with uncle grahm
---
When start on hour than 2 minute wait than can be over in less than 2 minutes kinda not worth it lol. But easy rewards for just getting there
---
Pick up Poison resist pieces and run Fireproof perk.
---
Ez pz
---
I still avoid electric knives because of that movie...
---
they updated it today for console's.  on xbox the update was roughly 1000MB
---
What are your hardware specs?
---
No
---
You're not a hacker.
---
Doubt it.    Unless they have a super score week and have the time to grind it.
---
Tried it twice so far on Xbox and both times the lag was horrible and then I was disconnected from the server.   Glad they weren't my nukes that were launched or I would be pissed.
---
true, and if you are fast enough and kill it while glowing, it gets stuck in this glowing animation for around 3-4 minutes.
---
I'm 505 with a sbq specific build and I will join any off posts for the event. So far I've done it almost solo. 2 lvl 40 somethings with me and we did it. I have to give them credit, they did their best and where ever happy and thankful at the end. Made it all worth while.
---
Oh okay, thank you. I am on ps4 but I suppose the update file size is the same for all consoles.
---
I know everyone is saying fixer. But if you really like the look of a sniper as well I can recommend the Lever Action rifle. (And I dare to say a regular bolt action modded into .50 receiver is a decent weapon as well if you get some good legendary effects) (instigating effect is awesome for snipers and sneak builds just FYI)
---
But I wouldn’t worry too much about a good rifle until you hit level 50. Just be sure to use the highest available level on weapons until you get there. 
---
From 50 and up you have placed the max amount of point in your SPECIAL. And we are all kinda equal from there. 
---
I would highly recommend you goin for a sneak build as well with sniping (if you aren’t already) because of the double damage bonus you got from it. 
---
Edit: just be sure to use weapons that support your picked perk cards so you actually get the bonus effects from those as well. 
---
Hope it helps a little. 
---
Good luck out there!
---
2/3 runs were a total lag shitfest with 2-5 fps after the event was running about 10+ minutes (all of us were commenting about the lag on xbox party so we were all seeing it), to me seems tied to length of time the event takes.  When we killed it in 8 mins in one run of it that event was acceptable performance wise, other 2 hell-no.
---
What system I got like 10 nuke key cards and have been waiting to use them.
---
It kinda boosts the ammo market, but whatever you say.
---
Something is not working well, that's for sure. Dummy hits with no damage, critical hits causing average damage, vats getting the numbers but no health loss... Maybe all this, who knows.
---
My vats commando is not as fun as he used to.
---
It’s a “lite” version of the new conditional ammo drop system they’re implementing. Daily Ops on the PTS currently use the “full” version of it-
---
On live, only 1 in 4-5 wendingo spawn will drop ammo. Daily ops, every single enemy drops ammo. It’s based on the type of ammo you shoot them with (unclear if it’s just “whichever gun is in your hands when they die” or something else). 
---
It gives random ammo if you are a melee build, or use a Gatling Laser/Plasma. 
---
The ammo ammounts seem “tuned”... ultracite 50cal and Ultracite 2mm EC both seem to drop in stacks of 6, 12, or 24 (maybe 18 as well). 5mm drops in stacks of like 60-90, which is hilarious when you’re using a Gatling gun.
---
Thankssss
---
Aww shucks, thanks! all I had to do was server hop to find someone that wasn’t AFK drumming to get a clean audio scan!
---
half the time, the primal cuts event fails even when 7 other players and i finish the last wave. we kill all the creatures in the area and it still fails.
---
Part of the fun of being a high level is leading the jr players in events like this. I totally agree, bring them all to play.
---
Yes
---
/4 Agree.. it's a bit ridiculous that a mob as large as Earle doesn't leave a dirty great corpse. Wow raid bosses were massive &amp; so we're their corpses! Plus this fight is fun but ain't no Liche King🙄😂
---
I joined a server and saw the event had just started, so I scrambled to get there quick. It was myself and two others. Several minutes in my beloved shotgun broke. No more quick kills.  Running low on .45 ammo, had to make shots count. Slowed down to a crawl - power armor ran out of juice. Only thing I could do was load up on chems and spam stims, trying to help out as much as I could. All 3 of us made it out alive, and sprinting for the exit was intense because I relied on their support to survive. It was thrilling and I loved it
---
Furious can't work with magic damage effect because the magic damage comes from a version of Furious. If you run a furious weapon, that will cancel out the magic version.
---
I'm building a junkie build just for the event
---
I'm on xbox, did my first run through, died several times, but we finally killed him. Got 2 3 stars out of it and the cursed shovel so I count that a success.
---
Super Muties typically carry a lot of it at lower levels 15 and below, or at least that seems to be my experience
---
This happened to me the last time I tried to make the event. 
---
Imo the event icon should be placed on top of any player icon (that you're not grouped with) instead of the other way around, so this doesn't happen. I'd rather have a harder time clicking players who are at an event then the event itself. Because how often are we on the map trying to click on a icon of random player's name who's at an event?
---
Ok thanks
---
Tuesday’s at 11:00AM EDT for me
---
It’s if certain guns are used... mostly the Tesla rifles
---
Oh! You're the guy that did all those give aways!
---
Your house matches your heart.
---
Ah you know what, its because I allready own it so it's showing up for me. My bad
---
It seems to take up much more budget than all the other items I've displayed, though. I had to remove 3 things from my case to make enough space for it.
---
I.... I can't tell if you're joking or not because I wouldn't put it past Bethesda to do that to Xbone players
---
Mowing down ADS is actually super beneficial for everyone.
---
I would die for a level 68 plain cloths mumbling mothman cultist to take overseer. Literally would kill myself in the game for this.
---
They have always been 3 pounds before weight reduction perks.
---
Still 3lbs here on PS4.
---
Depends on perks, always weigh the same without.
---
I would say that too if I saw that in someone else's camp but this, I honestly had no hand in it other than that I found it in my camp and then put a lock on it. 
---
I enjoy playing this game too much to go and do something like get myself banned by doing some kind of series nonsense actions. Also I don't have friends to play with that know how to do that kind of stuff.
---
You are running a bloody build so odds are you are keeping your health around 20% I'd guess. It's challenging for sure to kill it with bloodied. I use bloody pa build and spam stems continuously but love the event.
---
This might help!

---
My carry weight goes up as soon as I join team due to Herd Mentality
---
I often struggle to find it. Had a nice anti-armor LMG too. Currently rocking an explosive instigating minigun.
---
I ran it 3 times when i was on earlier.  1 time i was getting like 2 fps and the other 2 were fine.  Contrary to what other people are saying the ones that were fine had peoples using teslas while the one that was really bad, didn't so it has nothing to do with teslas imo.
---
That’s wild. I had one of three glitch through the floor, but zero lag. I’m on a fiber connection, but surely that doesn’t matter?
---
I’m on PS4.
---
Isn’t that how COVID started
---
Nope, someone can nuke it for you. Just gotta talk to Maggie first.
---
That's amazing! Thanks!
---
Maybe it's not such a nefarious bug. Could be they found an exploit to just drop bullion equipment for trade or something?
---
Still aint got nothing on the Red Death from Fallout 4.
---
That’s not good. I got 3*** all day. And the cursed shovel.
---
Bro but bro its like fun tho because angry turtle said so bro 
---
/s
---
Ah, I guess that’s what’s happening with the people complaining about lag. I’ve been lucky, no Tesla users.
---
I have to admit I kind of loved it 😂 though I’m glad it’s over
---
Once you have the plans they can show up in certain drop tables. As far as I’ve seen they can only be the direct to inventory rewards. Like the Preveyor and event rewards. Never seen an enemy drop any bullion items.
---
I don't sell ammo
---
It’s about a gig and a half on PS4. Not too long if you got good connectivity. The event is nice but it’s only 8 people per lobby.
---
2/3 plays so far and it’s absolutely intense
---
Learn the thing. You might never get another copy.
---
No a f**ker ate one of those things 
---
F**king a bat just gets you aids and a mindless army
---
Just wanna say thanks to the 4 other players who thought it was too tough and bailed on me...Obviously didn't succeed,but went down kicking and screaming..
---
Same. Kinda turned me off on the whole event
---
I’ve only done the event once (which is definitely enough for now until I get more stimpaks) but when I went there were at least six of us which included a level 37. Thanks to the higher levels bringing their heavy hitting guns, and me acting as canon fodder we were able to kill him. The loot I got was unfortunately also underwhelming, a hunter’s pitchfork- which I was surprised for it to be a 3-star legendary- and some other things from him, from the event itself I got the Wendigo Colossus Skin Rug. 
---
I feel that the event needs a big ole nerf though, there’s lots of lag that hinders the running of the area with everything going on, I’d like to see a bit more visibility as well I lost the colossus more than once and got turned around a lot when the mine was collapsing.
---
Lmao that's it? Stop by my camp ill give u good stuff man
---
The satire is obvious right? But the only people I know that mentioned they loved GTA when they found I played games, were the wannabe gangbangers that sold me drugs, and they didn’t really seem to see any of the humour.
---
Looking for 5 more players.
---
That's a yikes from me.  Killing spawns is good, but doing damage to Earle is hard as a sniper.
---
Damn xbox here
---
whats the fix you tested it would be quite helpfull for the people that are experiencing the bug
---
I want my damn helmet
---
i thought that shit was hilarious
---
Thanks
---
[deleted]
---
Provided you have one you can make the others do that role. I have the raider one collecting scrap and I love him
---
Scorched carry it pretty often. Personally I live sorta by Morgantown and the railroad is chock full of Scorched who carry hunting rifles. Plus workshop defense events
---
Yeah whatever weapon you kill a wendigo with seems to drop that specific ammo for it. I kept finding 2mm on them when I was using my gause shotgun and then when I killed a few with my regular shotty I was finding shotgun shells on them.
---
They drop prime ammo but like 1/4th what they drop normally. So when I kill them with my gauss shotgun that’s not primed they drop around 30 2mm EC rounds. But if I kill them with my Gauss Minigun that is primed, they only drop about 7-9 ultracite 2mm.
---
You can access other people's scrap bots?!?! Not only that but I haven't been collecting it because I thought it went to my stash haha ive been playing for a week
---
Yes. Only thing you don’t keep is the ability to put more items in the scrap box and availability to private servers
---
Edit: oh and also the discounts in the store will be lost ofc.
---
I'm so close to being finished. Cant wait to do the same ol same I miss it
---
They should really disable insta death, make sure we go down instead, since as it is, the only way to "go down" is if a wendigo does just the right amount of damage, and if there's no hazards nearby
---
Yeah, just go after super muties, I mean i'm not more than a week old into the game and often kill super muties for my 308s.
---
Private world with friends to keep Earle busy, but not kill him.  Infinite wendigo spawns, stonks.
---
Fallout 4 had the opposite problem, with an insane damage drop for making a rifle automatic. Finesse is not their strong suit.
---
The first thing to do is to start with the one in the Forest. If it's too easy, then do the next one up north in the Toxic Valley. If you can do that one easily, then move to the Savage Divide. I am thinking the Mire and Cranberry Bog are going to be too much, so don't try to solo them. To succeed the event, you only have to clear all four waves before the timer runs out. Often the enemies don't move toward the barrel after spawning and you have to go sprint over and hit them so they follow you back or just kill them there. It can become annoying if you struggle with running out of Action Points.
---
Opposite, things appear out of nowhere, but disappear into thin air :-)
---
Good god, I had no idea that there was any kind of respawn timer, let alone an incrementally increasing one! That makes so much sense in hindsight. I was wondering why my game was taking longer to “load” when it’s usually pretty quick with the ssd. Pretty sure I’ve missed out of some legendary loot because of this.
---
It's with the gorilla statues.
---
I was worried about this as well. 
---
I also use an Instigating Lever Action. 
---
I guess killing spawns is our role in this event and let the bloodied heavy builds take Earle down.
---
Same as the SBQ I think. Except I believe he’s less resistant to explosive damage because I see people with the explosive plasma Gatlings burn him down at a decent rate. 
---
But I don’t recommend using anything on him that isn’t a Gatling Plasma or Laser. I really don’t understand people using thousands of 556 or 45 rounds on these boss enemies when the efficiency and damage output of a Gatling Laser, without any damage perks besides bloody mess. Is more than enough to slowly take him down. Even better if you throw power user on.
---
Low levels on the SBQ is fine, it doesn't hurt because the whole server is allowed to participate, but when they lock us into only 8 players more strict event access is required!
---
Same with my ultracite 45 rounds. Seems like every other wendigo I kill drops 35-40ish rounds.
---
Damn, though as much. Few things I want, but not for how many atoms it will take to get there, lol. Thanks for the answer, cheers
---
I feel. Don’t get me wrong I can do okay damage to Earle. Maybe it’s the support player in me but I enjoy killing the spawns. But I do know to hurt Earle when I have good line of sight. 
---
I’ve got a bloodied faster fire rate fixer I’ve been trying to sell that I may dust off and use. But I’m looking for the ammo per shot and semi auto rifles to swap too. I get it heavy guns are better but I’m not swapping perks for 20+ minutes.
---
I did three successful runs pretty much back to back on PS4 and haven't had any problems yet
---
Thank you to everyone for being relatively tolerant of my frustrations. It just seems that no matter if it's just me or me with 6 others, we always run out of time before wave 4 comes. That is very frustrating. I use a 2 shot explosive faster aim gatling gun so it's not my weapon.
---
I've done 5 theres a few little things and as expected lags when everyone is shooting but its been decent for me
---
Whenever you hear "attention citizens, nuclear detonation imminent" or something like that it gives you I believe 2 minutes to get down there. You've prolly just had bad luck as to when someone launched the nuke versus you joining the server.
---
Yep, I had a level 28 in the first one i did and he literally didn't do anything. Not that he could have, but he was in the way nonstop.
---
Yeah you are pretty lucky all I’ve gotten is half the ppl are afk or below level 50 and the ones I have won I got ass rewards
---
I'm not a fan of the nerf myself.
---
I don't have the perfect combination of legendaries (weapons and armor), perks, mutations, chems etc to get an insane amount of damage. The same probably goes for most people.
---
I have a decent'ish bloodied build and high level enemies can be though bulled sponges at times. I can't imagine how much difficult that will be with the nerf is released in public.
---
You'd need to completely respec to use a heavy gun, personally I like them more in general.
---
Yeah, that sucks. We can only go to DMVs in our own county and by appointment only. I've done online for most everything. Otherwise, appointments are booked for months in advance now.
---
A glitched magic weapon, this won't be possible in the future.
---
I'm level 450 and I died 3 times in the event just now.  Luckily I was in a good group and got revived 2 out of 3.
---
Thank you.
---
That sucks - had two runs, one with randoms, and everyone stayed until the end. What platform are you on?
---
swarmin vermin.
---
lol i remember posting this exact same thing awhile back and everyone told me “that was the point”
---
I’m at rank 75 or something. 
---
If my calculations are correct I’ll have to spend about a 1000 atoms to finish before it ends. Unless as others mentioned, that we have another double (or more) score weekend or something like that
---
Or a way to get multiple enimes in one meat/metal pile. Reduce piles and increase FPS due to less server strain
---
It'll make it harder as it'll nerf every gun in the game!
---
Very rare. About 0.081% chance to drop.
---
Can my friend and I get in on it? Levels 351 and 277
---
Don’t sell your self short. Bloodied isn’t king. All builds are viable to you if you make them. If killing spawns was our lot in this game. Then there would a lot of players never getting loot, because we let them do all the heavy work.
---
I'm 3 for 3 on that fucker getting stuck in the ceiling/floor and then just like casually walking in and out of the arena. These bugs exist, why have timers on these events?
---
Vampire weapons do work well there.  I do best with my VE Fixer or Laser Rifle.  And I'm a bloodied build.
---
Yes, I was doing one earlier and eventually realized I was the only one left giving it hell.
---
People might complain that it's derivative, but that's about it. Unless they blatantly lift story or art assets, there's no legal leg to stand on. "Power suit with drill arm" has tons of prior art, and isn't copyrightable even if it didn't.
---
There are "extra dailies" starting Thurs I believe (maybe for a week) and a couple of the weeklies which are reasonable. You would have to play pretty solidly gaining XP though because other than that the only way you have of boosting SCORE is the recurring XP accumulator. The requirement for each rank increases too, so currently there are not enough points in one day to rank up (each day), I think.
---
Now I bet you're going to say you don't have time to play constantly for the next 2 weeks solidly 😅
---
Notification doesn't always show up.  Fairly often I get a bug where I don't get have notification at all until I switch server or restart the game (events starting, collecting items, what my vender sold etc).
---
Thanks a lot! Would a travelling leather coat be too much to ask for it, you think?
---
this has been a long-standing problem that Bethesda can't seem to comprehend
---
Low levels can't handle end game dungeons in ESO, what're you smoking?
---
Also survival tent placement
---
Angry Turtle says it happens when you kite him too close to the walls and do damage.
---
I have a heavy gunner. Energy heavy gunner actually. But I’m not about to switch characters just to change roles in an event.
---
I went in with a a perception build and all 3 perk cards maxed for non automatics and did plink damage with a 3 star legendary.
---
I think damage is in a horrible spot with this game and it's totally antifun to reward people with bloodied builds and all that jazz when that completely walks away from the idea of Fallout 3, NV and 4. These games shouldn't need optimal builds to do current content like WoW.
---
This happened too me but i fast traveled to my friend whi was inside and it put me in.
---
I’m getting a lot of shit for this lol
---
The way the event works , we will get low lvl joining unfortunately.. we can’t control who decides to join the event. 
---
So the odds of low lvl joining are high especially if server cap at 24 people 
---
Are we ganna throw a fit and quit the event because a lvl20 joined?
---
Now 4
---
As long as you die before the escape timer ends you will keep everything.
---
I will stay and loot bodies until the last 10 seconds and then kill myself. Keep all the junk and still get all the loot.
---
3lb or 0.3 when using Batteries Included (INT)
---
No problem dude I'm actually just really wanting to understand all the perspectives here 
---
I see where you're coming from, but I do have some counterarguments that I would really appreciate you clarifying if that's alright 
---
Unfortunately I'm sleepy af and I wanna make sure I present my side as clear as I can, so is it cool if I reply to this discussion some time tomorrow?
---
Have you played eso? Pre-lvl50 lvl do regular dungeons all the time bro..
---
If I don’t get a good cut, I’ll be cutting you.
---
If you play ps4 I can give you all of the prizes
---
And customer support just doesn't care, they just auto lock any ticket that even mentions problems with the score system!
---
And this one will be exploited en masse and Bethesda won’t be able to track this one :D
---
They tracked dupers because there were server side transactions for weapons and armor. This doesn’t register anything on the server like the NPC vendor does.
---
Respawn bug perhaps?
---
Sure, sure.  I would recommend ballistic for earle though as he has high energy resistance.
---
Just go into the game, go into photo mode, and make a list of the different frame locations.
---
I don't guess I will be doing this cause I am not going to waste that many rounds for something I may or may not kill please tell me a bloody build is not the only way to beat this thing.
---
Regular dungeons, not endgame raids, which this is!
---
Max rank
---
I just beat it, then died randomly after looting it (no idea how), and respawned outside without losing anything. Win?
---
I use anti armor gauss rifle and do well with the spawns but not so much on Earle
---
Yeah tbh I don’t know how I got so many upvotes
---
Oh yeah totally agree. Don’t get me wrong. 
---
But non the less heavy builds tend to have lot more dps than us. And seem to be good in boss battles like the SQB as well. 
---
In fact I’ll go ahead and say that it’s cool with the roles being spread out. 
---
I would enjoy helping in that way of killin the spawns so those guys can kill him quicker.
---
It's so nice having both the weight of your ammo and power for pa be reduced by the same perk.
---
Get the batteries included perk. Reduces it by a bunch
---
This dropped for me about three months ago.  Ps4 if you want me to craft it for you.
---
I was thinking of dusting my gauss rifle off. But tbh I don’t want to craft more 2mm rounds.
---
You can lock them, but I was on their public team. Not sure how that works, but maybe they had it locked and I was able to access it anyway.
---
Oh yeah totally forgot, my bad.
---
😂 I can imagine it now with my stealth built ass, creeping around some ruin when all of a sudden *clang clang clang*. It'd be a real monkey on my back. Eh? Eh?
---
I did the other day.
---
No worries! I also recommend "perk load out", "make balloons, not meat piles", "save everything", "camp budget", and "better inventory"
---
This is why I like big guns 1-3 cores into him and If i lose anything then its not matter to me and I can get them cores back with a daily or event
---
It's amazing, I thought I'd be chewing through the ammo, but nope I'm wasting far less ammunition too!
---
See of you can build displays for them and make a treasure room in your camp 🤔
---
I’ve gotten 3.
---
When I did it a month or so ago I think it was automatic, you listen to the final log of the Responders and she talks about making the inoculation. I think that leads to the next quest. I guess you listened to that log to finish the quest already though...
---
Or get mobbed by wendigos, or get swamped with flaming loogies, or get screamed into radiation or the abominable drill of doom.
---
This.
---
Aim for the head! When done right it's more ammo efficient than rifleman!
---
Adequate items like the chally outfit and the backpack. Also a meat tenderizer which is cool
---
My "click the shiny" would have fired long before self control had a chance to get a single word in the conversation.
---
I don’t know why you’re being downvoted man, it’s only true. It took a dupe glitch being made out of the stash theft glitches to get it fixed.
---
Yeah that's shitty. Throw in all of the camps built on top of the prime meat Spawn areas and you've got a serious shit show.
---
Meh fight? I need some of what you are smoking.  Earle puts up a good scrap.
---
Agreed. At queen fights. I often use my instigating on her spawns and my laser rifle to burn her when she’s hovering or landed. But lately been using a zealots primed hunting rifle.
---
I've only gotten the rug...
---
Some level 428 guy came to the grahms meat event and after it was over that player keeps on talking trash and following players until they die and steal junk loot and have a combat knife that can kill you really quick like one or 2 hits, bc of his perks or mutations, and ended up taking all of our junk, I killed him without vats and called me trahs when he used vats, idiots these days so alot. Of us reported him and he got kicked from the server, but all junk was lost, tired of players being so greedy and make you accedently go on PvP on perpose and take your junk you worked hard on,
---
I enjoyed trying to force someone else to do it and watch them struggle
---
Yeah I literally just got it
---
Was someone using a tesla rifle?  Seems to be the issue for me.  Pixelated terrain and awful frames
---
I have seen this poadr several times before.  Its a common bug.
---
I'm not on xbox till the event goes away so I wanted to know what I was missing out on
---
Also the event glitches out and doesn't always award event completion!
---
It was broken in the patch last month, they’re trying to fix it now but no ETA unfortunately
---
I've gotta hand it to the level 18 that was there in a rad suit with me tonight. They actually stuck around for the whole thing and killed a few of the spawns. I was expecting them to turn tail and run when the event started. There were definitely a couple that did leave though it's hard to tell if they just get the respawn glitch.
---
See you don’t play eso lol get out of her 
---
All content has 2 levels regular and veteran.. and the whole game pride itself in “no lvl gate” content
---
So yea a low lvl can do endgame content at “regular” difficulty and get endgame gear (sync to their lvl)  at a blue quality
---
And incase you wonderingIn eso gear quality can be upgraded via crafting so lvl50 blue endgame gear can be turned into legendary
---
Exactly what I’m doing as well. 
---
Always keep my zealots explosive Gatling with me for when she lands.
---
what is that ? a desk fan ?  who carries around a desk fan ???
---
Would this work for explosives as well? M79, missle launcher, fat man
---
1 spot left
---
I did sort of the same thing earlier. Spammed some formula P and sat in the tunnel entrance nailing Earle and his minions from across the room.  Stayed alive a lot longer and still did a lot of damage.
---
This is a normal experience for me playing this game on XB1
---
Understandable. Did it three times so far, all wins but apparently some guys never intended to put in much efforts, only hide and farm some windigos. Luckily there’s always a couple of real fighters in the party so we beat it every time.
---
I am almost level 600 and died like 10 times maybe more. Had a team of 5 and had a Prime Blooded Gauss Minigun and used all my ammo and had to fall back on my Blooded Handmade and used almost all its ammo. The Damn thing kept regenerating every single time we died and rejoined the fight!
---
Someone taking your workshop isn’t griefing. It’s a PvP zone, which you agree to when you claim the workshop.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Remember it?  Earle disappeared immediately on me today.  Good times.
---
Full on seriousness, please expand on this and post as a discussion. "Plague on our lands!". Could be a major hit, go full Karen with an RP from blazing saddles.
---
Is the respawn bug still happening?
---
I do play eso yes, and anyone below level 180 is going to be kicked out if they try to run one of the endgame dlc raids! They're too mechanic heavy and will just one shot the under equipped low levels!
---
And upgrading level 50 gear to legendary is a real waste of resources as its too expensive to do so on gear that isn't level capped, it's just a waste.
---
Participate in events. Kill things.
---
On ps4, and going back right now. Pduch70 is fo id
---
I wish they would come out and say these were requiring teamwork then, rather than saying they can be completed alone or with up to 4 people.  Also, why just requiring melee?  There should be some requiring other finishers as well.  Another thing too is these are randomizing every 2 hours in the PTS.  It may very well be once a day when they release them and this will screw over a lot of people if the one for that day is something they cannot do.
---
Your beefytrout has gone limp.
---
How much flux you need? I have a bit saved up and already have a shower built. (Username the same)
---
sounds like astonishing tales #5 just went up in price
---
So would you be willing to build one for me? My psn is x\_Hardcase\_x
---
Attention, after finding ways to cause the glitch the only reliable way of fixing it I’ve found is to go to a NEW server not exit and rejoin your friend. Go to a NEW server and analyze the blood and than put in the fuze
---
Just finished my first Colossal Problem on X1X and holy shit, what a slide show it was. And it's all because of the Teslas, as said before as you can clearly feel the frame-rate rebounding every time a Tesla user is reloading. There's no way to play an event like this at 5 to 10 fps, we managed to kill Earle but we started the event with 8 players and finished it with 5 because 3 simply crashed mid-event
---
People have been using exploits since the game released. Short answer, no.
---
PC and normally I would agree if it wasn't suspicious as fuck. This specific instance my body was teabagged and the person spammed sound board queues at me
---
I can build the plushie for you if you would like
---
I mean, I’m already running a build like that :P
---
Early game is laughably easy since everything dies in one shot to the chest and you can start using BP pistols at level 5 I believe.
---
Late game is needlessly hard without buddies to back you up tho.
---
With VATS crits and perks geared towards crits you can deal some decent damage and kill that sheepsquatch or scorchbeast eventually, but god help you if you pop all 10 shots and something is still alive lol
---
The aesthetics are priceless though, especially if you can scrounge together a pirate costume and maybe even go the extra mile to build a ship CAMP.
---
Check player vendors :)
---
Yep. It's totally doable with junkies as well. I ran it as junkies heavy weapons with a bunch of under 100s and one guy with a deathclaw gauntlet and a bloodied stealth commando and we had no problems finishing. You'll just use more ammo if you're not bloodied.
---
Never had this problem because I don't really die but the once i did it was 5 seconds
---
Ok gotchu but one of the things I'm looking for is how to trade myself up to a fixer or a good gun.
---
I'm on xbox
---
That is upsetting
---
Who knows when they will fix it.  To progress you either need to server hop to get it done, or complete it on a private server.  Server hop may take a few to serveral times but you will be able to complete it either way.  You are looking for a server that someone hasnt done it since reset.
---
Yea gotchu.
---
Lore wise I did see my Fallout 3 wastelander puppeting salvaged Enclave Power Armor to scare of intruders!
---
If I dont respond to some of you it's because of my connection I appreciate all of the feedback. :)
---
I ran it with randoms this morning in Xbox but unfortunately it got nuked around the same time as the hourly meat week event and only myself and two others showed up. We got it to mutate and down to 25% of its second health bar but unfortunately failed it. Used thousands of rounds of ammo and about 10 repair kits (some of my guns we’re close to breaking already and my executioners flamer only lasts for about 3 mags). What an intense fight though! I‘ll be better prepared for the next one and hope for more attendees!
---
LOL
---
Oh yeah I'm addicted to those trophies. I only need to get the 100 objectives on Fallout Shelter and I'll have 100% for all the Fallout games.
---
Kicked out by who? The fact I’m defending is that THEY CAN JOIN if they want Not if they should or not 
---
If you don’t want low lvl joining then do the event in a practice server 
---
I’m not arguing with you if it a waste or not to upgrade gear I’m trying to point out that both eso and fo76 don’t have lvl restriction when it come to doing content (wastelander quest did have lvl20 requirement)
---
Being like that for 5 hours Everytime in that event, reminds me of player that died trying to escape death form scorched queen event will lose all there fluxes, players are so greedy these days.
---
Notice how in the title it says “PS4”
---
Helps to have good teammates too.
---
First time it was full group and it took us 25 minutes.
---
Just did it for my second time and it was 5 of us with 1 afk low level and we did it in 5 minutes.
---
Yep.
---
There is also a subreddit that starts with market and ends with 76 (we're not allowed to say its name here but check my post history to find it). Browsing through it can give you a good idea of what is popular, what sells, what prices etc. Happy trading :)
---
"Things I Didn't Realize I Wanted, Part 2: Not Just Goth Nuka Girl."
---
Tried it for my first time and it failed. Was mostly my fault tho cuz i didnt expect it to take so long and didnt repair my gattling plasma or shotgun before i went in and they both broke almost instantly. Then i ran out of 556 ammo and was basically useless. I knew it was supposed to be a hard fight but damn it does a number on ammo and guns. Know not to go in unprepared next time
---
Yes, yes I am. Because hindering OTHER PEOPLES gameplay so you can have fun isn't an acceptable mindset. It's cool to have those builds, but when they cause issues for other players, it's just human decency to pull out a different gun. Same argument as people who one-shot legendaries; taking someone else fun/loot, so you can feel cool/strong, isn't ok.
---
The ammo is so heavy for such bad damage too!
---
30 sec wait,then 45,then 60 sec before respawning
---
My apologies. I just picked up an extra and was curious what I could ask for it. Thank you though. 👍
---
I keep missing it because somebody nukes the Mine like 5 minutes before the event starts then the whole server goes there just to not complete the Colossal Encounter
---
Test it
---
The unarmed build is great for the normal Collosus, get a Deathclaw Gauntlet!
---
I was doing my first when I died and the no respawn glitch occured. I'm fuckin pissed. Wasted like 10 plasma cores and a nuke card.
---
Yup, we did.
---
Yea ik what ur talking about. It's a great place but I want to know how I can trade my way from a random legendary to a fixer stuff like that.
---
I was gonna refrain from nodding, but...
---
Right?  
---
Yes, I'm here to tag and level, yes I do contribute and enter events alone, just let me tag the big boys before you one-shot them lol.  
---
Doubly so for the asses shooting right at me instead of moving to get a clean shot.
---
PC is rife with issues. You have my sympathies.
---
No worries!  I lept to that assumption.
---
Do you know if this can be achieved with a TSE .50 cal and the armor piece?
---
- Do events.
---
- Kill Legendaries.
---
- Trade your scrip in to Mumbles for 3* ranged weapons.
---
Don't just sell any gun you find out in the world. If you truly want traffic to your shop, skip the plain pipe weapons and hunting rifles. Stick only with 2* and 3* weapons.
---
Yes the first time is always a learning experience lmaooo
---
It’s funny my bloodied stealth commando hits for like 1k with it I just get found to easily
---
You have to be a special lover of pain to play RUST.😎👍
---
You know you set yourself up in monumental fashion right?..  This should be good.
---
Big oof. Has a level 29 keep asking ya to revive him and eventually I was like “these stimpaks would be put to better use healing me and the level 100’s”
---
It is really weird. My brother started animal crossing not to long ago and paid ten dollars for 10mil in bells. The whole game. Anything he wants he can buy. Within the first month his island was decked it.  Its tempting. But will never do it
---
It was Todd Howard btw
---
You can claim workshops without going to the red workbench. You only need to be in the build area and press the build button. This could explain why people were able to claim the workshop without you seeing them use the workbench :)
---
Where it spawns you outside the mine and you can’t re-enter?
---
Yeah with a bloodied one it's decent, it's just the ammo to weight comparison for higher damage weapons for the same build!
---
First time everything went smooth, second time I got greedy with screws and ended up not making it to the crate near the exit in time. At least I got some cool shit from it though
---
You can even activate it by nuking the queen
---
Scrip and treasury notes!
---
I can't find the budget one.
---
Ah ok.  That’s pretty cool
---
Almost my entire stash weight is known plans. I sell them for like 20 caps a pop because I happen to have maybe 100 or so duplicates. And every time I hop on a server people message me and ask if I duped them or hacked them in and of course I haven’t... I’ve been playing since launch and would absolutely hate to get banned.
---
Just did my first and got a cursed executioners harpoon gun
---
Why treasury notes? I know that they are currency but can you get legendarys or what does it give you?
---
He likely fell through the floor. It happened to me
---
LOL!  I didn't get it on the first fight, but he glitched just like that on the second one.  Alternated from feet hanging out of the ceiling, to sinking below the floor.
---
It sucks really it’s a really fun weapon but my handmade puts a boot up its ass lol
---
No ammo is “low level”
---
15-30 fps is pretty unacceptable. Also, Bethesda should service each platform equally.
---
It’s like those level 25 players who go to SBQ with deathclaw gauntlets.
---
Maybe the game doesn’t want you guys to one tap everything anymore. Work for it
---
Thankfully I managed to get a second fixer, so use the much lighter .38 rounds on it!
---
I think knowing what to look for (like popular prefixes and 2nd/3rd effect) can be of great help when browsing player vendors. You can find decent weapons and eventually trade up over time to getting the weapon you want. Not gona lie it takes time and effort, but it is doable. Knowing the market makes a big difference, it really helps :)
---
Ok gotchu thanks it's a big help
---
No, just on the normal respawns.
---
It was irritating but I was laughing every minute of it. Honestly, I was kind of sad it was over and wish it had tied in with both being the mayor and the general.
---
I agree with you about VATS being useless on Rifleman.  I use Bloodied Pipe Revolver and have 3 15 6 4 3 13 12.  Was actually going to drop one more point from Str and add to Agi.  Pipe revolver uses both Gunslinger and Rifleman perks but I have yet to find a weapon that does more damage.
---
I accidentally spawned into sbq even with no suit, spent the next 15 minutes dying and spawning into the nuke zone because it wouldnt let me repawn anywhere else.
---
Well that clears that up for me lol. I have never taken someone elses workshop only helped defend
---
And that’s better than a 1 week wait and less than 10 FPS at almost all times?
---
What are good 2nd and 3rd effects?
---
Another tip: if you don’t wear power armor for any reason (I don’t usually) then get the pneumatic mod for your chest piece. The Wendigo spawns stagger like crazy. If you get staggered by one, three more are ready to kill you or stagger you again.
---
She will land if the players get off the bunker and fence and just stand on the ground outside the fence.
---
Being serious, what would be considered griefing in FO76?
---
I have a good fixer aswell but I find the handmade a lot more fun I don’t know why
---
The fixer is a solid option if you have the perks to spec to commando.  TBH I'd rather use it than my heavy guns on Earle.
---
You're the kind of player that ruins the events for lower levels, I know you guys must be bored, but some of us are to level and also go to the 'cuts' events even alone to do so, not all of us are here to tag and dash lol.
---
Kk.  Xbox.  VocalLaser7201
---
Yeah PVP is not fun for me at the slightest bit considering who wins depends on primarily who has better gear and whos build is more suited for PVP. Skill has very little to do with winning a PVP match. Honestly if PVP had legendary effects and maybe perks disabled I would be more than fine with PVP. But because skill has little to no factor in PVP, I stick to PVE.
---
While the Fixer is better dps, the Handmade is better range and accuracy!
---
So 4pm UK time then
---
Didn't even pay attention to it
---
Fixed from what?
---
For whatever reason, AA doesn't do well against Earle.  My Vamps does about as much as my AA.
---
Same here :) It's basically the same mechanic when you're in your camp and you go into build mode. I've had a few fun pvp battles in workshops but it's not my thing really :)
---
What I like about the handmade is that there is some kickass skins for it
---
For me weapon condition, environmental awareness and actually working as a team are most important. I go in with a T-60 with a food build &amp; have yet to die or fail.
---
Knowing when to push Earle &amp; when to focus down the wendigos to draw the heat off main damage dealer's can sometimes make or break a certain run. 
---
Adequate ammo is important too but I rarely push past 3 fusion cores. Same with stims. My daily carry is more than enough.
---
Might check this out.  Got a Tesla but have mine modded for automatic.  Any idea if they are fixing these shotgun bugs for the next update?
---
I've missed a bunch because the server announce is pretty random. Most of the time it doesn't even alert.
---
I was going to paint mine with the blood Eagle one, but alas its glitchy and low resolution.
---
What is it about screws. Hell I end up dropping my screws often because I pick up so many. I just wish I could scrap them to steel.
---
Tea bagging, spamming sound boarded insults through their mic, use of exploits to keep hassling me after the fact, etc
---
Damn it. Seriously?
---

---
Rebuilt my Rocket Cafe into a Hotel. 3 rooms with different themes, a nice gift shop, small cafe, and of course a lobby with check in terminals :) all featuring double-sided walls!
---
I think you mean adrenaline.  Yes.
---
But I’m sure it sucks just the same...
---
I honestly JUST got sketched out about “public teams”,cause F...
---
Can you still build on another’s CAMP In public teams,like you can in private ones?
---
If so,I might not be joining anymore of em,just outta the fear of becoming a budget glitched absurd ammo factory jam,unintentionally.
---
That Ish would suck,
---
Too me anyhow
---
About to just claiming workshops on public servers
---
Tbh I don’t really focus on perks for weapons unless it’s breaking at a slower speed but I’ll definitely be looking at perks that help with damage now
---
Ok. This is just the first I've heard of it happening and was a bit worried.
---
Yeah the surprise or is all screwed up I bought the communist paint though and I saw a leak for a skin that almost remodels the gun
---
Brave souls, one and all. I salute their courage and conviction! 👏
---
I tried it solo. Really dumb idea. I spent I don't know how long respawning. Just ended up quitting.
---
Nah I have a shitty low level rifle that I use specifically for events. I go out of my way to let everyone hit legendaries and it pisses me off when other high levels run through and one shot everything. Those are the ppl I mess with
---
Boo - this is all I'm finding after discovering this today.  It's old, known, and unaddressed
---
Contesting as soon as they enter- normal ability.
---
Completely invisible- chameleo/stealth-boy/etc. normal. 
---
One shot you through power armor- likely not one shot as there’s a 110hp damage cap per shot, but a proper bloodied commando build can spit out 3+ 800 damage sneak attack bullets in about half a second, easily blowing through power armor.
---
I came here to say this. They make it look easy. Turtle just casually repairing his weapon half way through, changing perk cards. He’s wondering out loud if he should kill Earl or just farm the Wendigo Spawns. And he’s eating an ice cream the whole time.
---
Ah that’s not cool.  I’ve totally given up on workshops besides claiming them for the daily these days.
---
I've been playing since launch as well and can confirm this statement. Oftentimes I'll drop hundreds of plans right by the Vault 76 entrance.
---
My stacked foundation camp is legacy
---
I rerolled a new character to go commando and found that due to the limitation on guns and the frequency of card drops, you almost HAVE to start out as Rifleman first and then transition somewhere around lvl 45.
---
I and my team succeeded in the event, no deaths, but on leaving the mine.... Nothing, no reward, no event completion, no flux, no plans no treasury notes...
---
No problem! A good convo is worth the wait
---
That'd do it. There really should be a min level 50 requirement to even join the event.
---
On console?
---
I’ve taken my bloodied VATS sneak rifleman in with a BE lever action. I kill the spawns pretty fast (not quite one shot territory; I may switch up my setup to get to one shot on them) and I do solid damage to the boss whenever I run out of adds. And I can usually stay in Caution!
---
Yeah, console performance is pretty unacceptable. Beth haven't properly optimised a game for consoles since Skyrim - no idea why people keep buying them on console.
---
I can't use power armor it's too clunky and slow for me. I got all my armor maxed out and it does a pretty good job. I do think a Vampire Weapon would be good though.
---
I’ve done both. Perhaps it’s because I don’t have a good legendary handmade and my character isn’t made for sneaking with high agility, but I’m still sticking with my instigating bonus crit lever.
---
i found it realistic but hell ya annoying.  bureaucracy at work.
---
I had some issues with the loading into fast travel, nothing terrible yet. I’m running a 7 year old PS4 lol
---
Yup, bought mine earlier.
---
If you can grind the everloving shit out of the XP repeatable? Maybe. All depends on how good you are at stacking XP bonuses and how much playtime you have.
---
I very much doubt you can get there with the regular challenges.
---
Wait until daily ops. You’ll have ammo for days.
---
The Gatling gun seems the best for ammo gathering since you get 130~ ultracite ammo from the kills.
---
Ah, thank you for telling me.
---
How could ammo be depleted so easily?
---
on rifles many people go for ffr or explosive as secondary, however 50 vats critical dmg and 33 hit chance are decent as well
---
2*?!  i've only got 1* thing from the cookoff and i've done like 40
---
i love my raider collectron!
---
At least the quest works for you. It's still broken for me. I must have went in and out of that DMV 100 times.
---
Exactly. I think people do this exploit and then make posts like this in hopes that if they get busted they can use these posts as evidence of thief innocence
---
At least once I got 500 caps in there which is a pretty sizable amount if you ask me. Considering all you have to do is run a fee meters. Other times it was more like 25 caps tho 👀
---
I used to go around like you, but when I faced Earl Williams, I realized that semi auto weapons don't cut it for tanky bosses. You need automatic weapons to be helpful. Also, I use AAE weaponry.
---
Good lord that’s terrible...
---
Ok gotchu thanks
---
So everyone just has 1 of everything and has a super laggy camp anyway.
---
I shall tomorrow.
---
Me too, especially when he thinks of burning my camp down
---
Plot twist: OP's day job is as a bucket drum busker.
---
Because you got deaded multiple times!
---
I don’t think so. Every run I did only lasts 10 mins or so with like 4 to 6 people. 
---
I would expect him getting nerfed if they roll out the damage calculation change though.
---
It's a life saving mechanic in ESO and is sorely needed here!
---
Buy gold bullion! Buy the new armor and weapons. Lunchboxes in the future
---
5pm UK time
---
I don't like wasting time on stuff that fails, and it sounds like this would fail more often than not.
---
Yes.   Does that change the rules or something?
---
Did you read my post?
---
GET 'EM OUT BOYS, WE DID IT!!!
---
I am Blooded Heavy Weapon Build but I always go in Full Health because the event knocks you down to Blooded level in like thirty seconds.
---
There’s always selfcentered people. I have a vendor mule account. 30 max level weapons appropriately priced. 30 max level armor appropriately priced. And then the same for non-max, and lowlevel stuff is generally under 100 caps.
---
I still get plenty of high levels come through and buy a bunch of lowlevel stuff and then run and scrip it.
---
I think their minds are just wired differently, and this makes them an easy target for developers to abuse. I really hope some of them break free from it after this season crap.

I've seen some of them melee her and live through the entire fight even. Conviction is an understatement!
---
It's this all over again (if it isn't already):

---
Aaaaand your camp shop is where?
---
Can you get legendarys?
---
Yeah I hear you. Should have a limit
---
4pm according to google
---
A good friend of mine and I did this duo three times in a row. It was very fun! I tanked with a Vampires Flamer and LMG for healing, AAFFR Gatling plasma for Damage while he was bloodied, bloodied fixer. He killed the spawns while I took the hits. Speaking for myself, I think the biggest ammo saver is plasma cores. Stock on those bad boys. They’re going to be valuable. Flamer fuel too.
---
Yeah man. When you get the weapon plans you craft legendary versions.
---
Catchy tune.  Being a Kama'aina to Hawaii the music is very Waikiki touristy. Catchy.
---
This is the real Hawaiian music I grew up with and still listen to. Notice no steel guitar.  This is one of my faves:

---
Right? Like being level whatever makes a ducking difference? It doesn’t matter as I have seen countless level 100+, 200+, etc at the SBQ fight get killed over and over again, and NO not all were bloodied builds with 2 health points.
---
&gt;Can you still build on another’s CAMP In public teams,like you can in private ones?
---
Nope.
---
If they try, I'm excited to see what they break!
---
i get you i nuke it from time to time but most don't. the Colossal Problem quest which is commonly being nuked now has a bit of cobalt. and some creatures for the other materials but not many.
---
I have gotten to the point where I sell them for 1 cap each, (except mole minor gauntlets and ivory grips those are 0 and still don’t sell) I’d like to get a fair value for them but then I remember that it’s very easy to gain caps and I want to get rid of the plans filling my inventory. I personally collect tick plans though. The confusion other people must feel when they come to my camp expecting to find a plan they don’t have only to be met with 800 mounted ticks.
---
Hey, everyone loves a good screw.
---
So the chest is not worth looting then? You make it sound like it's better to stay and loot wendigos than it is to run for that chest.
---
And then next week it opens it's own store and sells it back to you...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Damn raider  bots.
---
My handmade was instigating so... yeah.
---
Either way, sneak attacks with my gauss rifle still did decent damage per shot. I’m honestly fine with killing the minions and being the medic while I let the over abundance of bloodied and heavy gun builds deal damage. Saves on ammo for me.
---
I sit there for a few minutes then leave. The long wait is why I quit playing the Battlefront games. Heck, they shut down the Battlefront I servers down.
---
Keep your distance. I was able to kite beyond his fear range and stay stelthed from adds with unyielding build no meds/food
---
No way. I did not know that. Thanks so much
---
1st effect (ranged weapons): bloodied / junkies / quad / instigating /  vampire /anti armor / furious
---
1st effect (melee weapons): bloodied / junkies / instigating
---
2nd effect (ranged weapons): explosive /+25% fire rate / +33% vats hit chance
---
2nd effect (melee): +40% faster swing speed / +40% power attack damage
---
3rd effect: (ranged weapons): -25% vats cost/ +15% faster reload/ 90% reduced weight
---
3rd effect (melee): +1strength / 90% reduced weight
---
It sometimes depends on the weapons. Heavy guns are quite popular with 90% WR or 15% reload speed due to their weight and longer reload animation, some guns are rubbish with 25% fire rate (example: powder weapons, single shot weapons). Rifles are often popular with 25% fire rate, less vats costs etc
---
That's roughly it, there are exceptions, light melee better with strength but heavier melee weapons do well with 90%RW
---
It's just seeing what trends, what people always look for :)
---
🤣🤣🤣👍
---
Why buff? Not all weapons should be equally powerful. 
---
I think it's power level is about right but could do with sight and suppressor.
---
You will regret that setup when no bloodies show up. It has happened to me before.
---
Btw I cant reply cos of my connection but could I do it with the fixer plan? I learned it so can I craft one?

Got mine
---
Have fun :)
---
Bullet sponge I hear, haven’t done it myself yet, building up ammo though.
---
Live damage calculation:
---
Base damage x Weapon perk x Bloody Mess
---
100 x 1.6 x 1.15 = 184
---
PTS:
---
Base damage x (weapon perk + bloody mess) 
---
100 x (1.6+.15) = 175
---
Same for virtually every multiplier (I actually suspect bloody mess ISN’T working this way actually, but the vast majority of multipliers are).
---
Thx so much
---
I sing along with that song. Love that swing music.
---
The damage difference vastly depends on how many multipliers you are currently stacking. It’s why Bloodied builds are hit hardest- they’re stacking the most multipliers; generally like 6+ as opposed to a more typical ~3
---
I know how it works. I didn't realize you decided to include an arbitrary base damage ammout
---
Basketball for the fearless. That's a nice view for sure.
---
I wish you the best, have fun, and with patience and determination you should eventually get what you want :)
---
Then why did you say you didn’t understand?
---
Check your armor. Make sure nothing needs repairing. If you have mutations, make sure they are still active.
---
Hey question. I had the option to nuke it, someone did before me, talked to Maggie after and finished the quest. Can I go nuke it still and it'll trigger the event? Can I nuke it repeatedly?
---
Really? it's one of the few times that the humour in a Bethesda Fallout game was actually a bit clever.  
---
It's a joke going "I bet these lines will continue even after the end of the world" sort of thing and somebody actually put thought into it.  
---
i'll take what I can with Bethesda.
---
If it’s obvious it won’t die there’s no reason to keep wasting ammo and stims
---
Perhaps, but I already have the rewards I care for. I’ll be fine.
---
Thanks:)
---
Nah man only the weapon plans bought with gold bullion. Wish we could do it with fixers but thats not the case
---
Bullet sponge isn't the word.  I've done it 3x tonight.  Definitely chewed thru some major 5mm
---
Exactly how my first run went   -_-
---
You can join events via your pip boy as well I believe. its in the data missions screen.
---
So there are "primal cuts" events every 15 minutes where you fight waves of creatures and a boss which may be legendary. You also get 3-5 prime meat as a reward.
---
Every hour on the hour is the Meat Cook event. You play drums, gather items, and kill critters. When it completes you get a random meat week themed plan or outfit and a 1 star legendary. You can also turn in up to 15 prime meat at the event and get 1 scrip per piece, meaning you can get an extra 15 scrip per hour if you're grinding hard.
---
Sweet...
---
Appreciate Cher snappy response!!
---
Seems like it. Do you happen to know how much drops for a lmg? I used to use one and it was so good but the ultracite ammo was just too much to keep up with
---
Everyone assumes all Bloodied Builds run at health around 20%? Not all Bloodied builds do. I keep my health higher and wear down my Enemies till they get me to Bloodied level 20% and then they are for sure dead.
---
I wish i could experience the same feeling but so far I've hit nothing but walls cause everytime i launch to activate it, everyone ignores it like it's Project Paradise cause it's "to hard". People on xbox need to "man up" and start doing the harder events, you'll have alot more fun if your focus isn't just about the legendaries.
---
I've had 10 minute long bullet sponge fights with him.  Did it earlier with 6 heavy gunners and he melted in about a minute and a half.  People need to have the right build to melt.  Your rifleman build or whatever won't cut it.
---
Earle is not a man who can be constrained by ceilings or floors.
---
Ya I never bothered with LMG yet. I would like to know too. Maybe I’ll only use it in ops if the drops are good. 
---
ACP imo is good for Gatling gun due to its efficiency. Gatling plasma seems the best for the event since it’s ammo is extremely cheap to replenish since I don’t like spending much time killing the adds.
---
Based on my recent three experiences with ACP, you just have to be holding the weapon to qualify for the drop. My friend would kill the spawn before I had the opportunity to light them on fire and yet I’ll get 33-40 Flamer fuel from their corpses.
---
i would love to join them
---
Decade? Try last two lmao
---
What is a Luck team?
---
Mathematically with just the standard weekly/dailies no.
---
If you’re *actually* doing 25% damage than something is wrong. But it’s more likely you didn’t actually do that damage if you are low level.
---
There’s a minimum damage threshold for EVERY enemy. It’s just low enough that most of the time you can easily hit it. I’m not sure of the exact amount, my guess is around 1-2% of health. 
---
I learned this taking a level 10 into a nuked Whitesprings a year ago. A few level 10 10mm pistol shots were not enough to get kill credit. I either had to dump the whole magazine into 1 ghoul, or use a harder hitting gun like a hunting rifle or 44 revolver.
---
I never do either, until after I post. 🤣🤣🤣 and it’s usually on the trading sub so I’ll typically get excited and post as fast as possible...then realize I can’t even acquire whatever it was I was excited about
---
I was wondering why the music was making me sad and then I remembered that it reminds me of the music used at dismaland lmao
---
No. Take this broken content instead. You're welcome.
---
Adrenal reaction wasn't ever broken.
---
Yeah, no. If you use a Tesla rifle during public events you’re just a cunt. It makes everyone else go below 5FPS.
---
This was from so long ago,  how deep were you in the subreddit?
---
Note for anyone doing the camera challenge for the mothman that isn’t part of the badges - mothman must be alive.
---
I've had this happen a few times at LITS on PC, especially when people do the survival tent trick. I've never had it tank my framerate as bad as the console player reports I've seen, but it's taken me down into the low 20s which is still impressive considering I'm running a 2060S at 1080p.
---
I had 2 level 50 guys fighting me when I was level 20ish I killed them both with my shotgun 3 times then they killed me and took all my junk and teleported away
---
Energy heavy guns, especially bloodied gatling laser will be very nerfed in upcoming patch.
---
Thinking that these events that only last 30 seconds should have their difficulty scale somehow
---
It’s best with high agility. It’s a pain when the spawn catch up because I have four agility.
---
UK daily resets are at 5pm
---
It's Grahm
---
Ah right fairs
---
My first bout this morning was rough. It was me (a lvl 218), another lvl 200+ player, and then three players below lvl 45. I went through 7,000 rounds and 40+ stimpaks. Finished with less than 2 minutes left. My second round was a breeze. I think the lowest level was around 180 and we finished with almost 10 min to spare.
---
Public teams can't access your locked items, most likely he either left it unlocked, or unlocked to trade with a particular person and you got there first!
---
My vote is for Graham
---
Love the fact that after a few deaths I have to wait 60 seconds to respawn. SMH
---
I don’t bother with plans or get excited when I see “300 plans” because it’s all mounted heads and useless garbage. 
---
Now I just go for ammo. Shotgun shells or 5mm. I’ll buy up to 10,000 idc. It’s stuff I know I’ll use. And I’m always at max caps anyway.
---
Right there with you - two separate times. I almost wish there was a penalty for quitting OR the boss would rescale to accomodate less players.
---
Slight digression, how rare are the Blue Ridge Caravan assault gas masks and the outfits? Haven’t gotten them since playing from the start..
---
garahm
---
Tried it for the first time earlier and not sure I’ll do it again unless the rest of the team is high level too, I unloaded a ridiculous amount of ammo only to fail the quest. Incredibly disappointing.
---
The event has a chance to drop one of 3 custom “cursed” weapons. They’re all specific rolls. They do more damage but have less durability than a “normal” version
---
Stealth rifle build here.  Maybe make sure you have a few hundred rounds, tops.
---
They never fixed the stash theft bug! They left it alone and they wrongfully thought it only hurt players who glitched their camp budget!
---
I agree that Bethesda really nailed the atmosphere, but it gets old very quick. I’ve only had the opportunity to run the event a handful of times on PC and already wish they would just give me the time to properly loot most of the kills. You miss out on a lot of ammo and screws by not looting the wendigo spawns. Bethesda took time to add the new ammo drops but you don’t get to take advantage of them before being forced out either by running up or just getting black screened. 10/10 for atmosphere. 0/10 for mechanics in a looter shooter.
---
Like other posts said there is also not really a huge sense of community accomplishment like you get with the SBQ laying on the ground where players can get pics of first kills or group/team achievements. You get the adrenaline rush of racing the collapse but then it’s just kind of meh without getting to really celebrate the kill. It also sucks when team member doesn’t get a spot in the event because a random joins before them, but that’s another issue.
---
I would have much rather seen a story mission version of the event with you working with NPCs to kill Earle that included the escape, then they could let the public event be a replay of the mission just without the end time limit. Imagine recruiting a bunch of old miners or mercenaries to go down and kill Earle in a huge cinematic battle sequence. They could have utilized the Motherload to avoid having to worry about nukes triggering the story’s mission and the public event, then have random list of names for the colossus each time you did the event. I would love to fight Kyle or Karen the colossus.
---
Did it for the first time yesterday. These Wendigo's are not a joke. I almost died several times during that fight. While I was busy trying to get rid of them, boss died and I was kinda mad since I couldn't find his corpse to loot it. After it's death, timer appeared to escape so I needed to run or I will die because. I was really happy that I was able to get out, especially since I got Reclaimed Deep Mining Gas Mask as reward.
---
I probably used around 10 or 15.
---
Man I guess i joined this sub way too late to hear about these while they happened. Youre talking about merch irl right?
---
People used to farm the sentry bots at Whitespring for fusion cores, and Beth put a stop to that. They also just recently patched out the """exploit""" of getting infinite screws from crafting and scrapping assaultron heads with Super Duper (I say """exploit""" because it really wasn't, - that's literally how Super Duper is supposed to work).
---
So yeah, all this points to Beth wanting certain rare commodities to remain rare. So I can totally see screws being removed from the loot tables of wendigo spawns (normal world wendigos would be unaffected of course).
---
I’m willing to trade. That was the point.
---
Can't be that much of a bullet sponge.
---
O you meant the screw drop. I read it I may have skimmed through it. Just thought you meant the colossus since people were complaining quite a bit about them recently not killing him after 30 mins.
---
I can see the screw drop being lowered to make sure players are actively trying to kill the boss rather then farm the adds.
---
I wish I'd had time to pick it up lol
---
I’m willing to trade. That was the fucking point.
---
You need the base plans first to craft, mods later.
---
Wasted 12 fusion cores with Power User active and a couple repair kits having 4 players lesser than level 35. There were only 3 of us with decent weaponry each going heavy class and we made it mutate at the 3 minute mark. We lost when it was just a sliver of health and we were just overrun by spawns... Mind you the three were lvls 58,92, and 151.
---
#MORE DAKKA
---
My thoughts *precisely*
---
Yep. This means screws won’t be rare anymore. I think it’ll mostly be fiber, springs (maybe), gears (maybe) and adhesive being the rarer materials anymore that are in demand.
---
No worries m8, that's what I figured, its really the unprepared that are failing though. Less its a glitch causing the fail
---
Omg it goes sooooo good with Ghillie camo skins.
---
I went with a bloodied baseball bat and could take out lvl 68 scorched.
---
So the buttressed arms plan is a mod?  Lol. So I need to start by purchasing left leg, right leg, left arm, and so on first?
---
Heroes get remembered, but legends never die.
---
Best way to phrase that ever
---
Maybe... maybe not. For me this is the adhesives issue all over again.
---
Adhesive use to be a big deal and any junk with it use to be valuable or you'd have to make the effort to setup an adhesive farm at your camp. 
---
Once Wild Apppalachia kicked in and we had player vendors, it stopped being that valuable to have because you could always hop over to someone else's camp to farm adhesive mats.
---
I imagine it'll be much the same with screws. Like it's great that we can get a ton and that'll help so much with so many things but it's not the be-all end all of things either. You still need plenty of other junk like gears, springs etc. if you want to, say, craft a ton of weapons to learn all the mods.
---
I had this happen and recorded as much of it as I could
---
I call bullshit. A good Bloodied build when properly equipped and played well doesn’t die. It refuses to. Whatever you’re trying to kill is dead long before it’s even looked at you. Exception being bosses. But the sheer damage you do, combined with (in a good Bloodied build) the sneak capabilities you have, unless you try and take on Earl head on (that’s the tank builds’ job, not mine), you shouldn’t be dying unless you have a prick using a Tesla rifle and dropping your frame rate to 2FPS, and 20 flames per second coming out of your console/PC.
---
The Thorn/Solar armor is, yes. It’s also twice as expensive in Scrip as SS; vastly more annoying to collect mats (thus his comment about server hopping), has more expensive mats (needs ballistic fiber...), and mods are fucked (no plans; have to pay A LOT of caps from the Enclave vendor PER MOD, and a bunch of the mods are broken, can’t be used).
---
*Destiny 2 has entered the chat*
---
Don’t worry, everyone’s gonna be insanely weak in patch 22
---
I keep getting the tender and not the plan for it.
---
I think it would be fantastic if they implemented a lost loot container just like in borderlands but that would only apply to legendary items. Makes sense to me!
---
You are going to need it if they promote patch 22 with the nerf unless you are bloodied or junkies.  I tried all my instigating stealth builds with semi-auto and they are all obsolete after the nerf. Seriously went from one shot to 3-5 and stealth is a bygone memory.  Bull-rushing and raw volume of damage is the only way if you don't want to play the two OP builds. My heavy gunner with it's collection of ballistic gats, mg-42s, and a Quad Explosive harpoon gun is affected very little when I ran West-Tek. Thankfully my TSE gat will still 'splode mutants with a couple of extra rounds.
---
Just put them in your vendor, I sell mine for 25 caps a pop and they still go. Or give them to me plz
---
Ohhh before the first dupe wave from Dupelanders, I lost my BE90 laser rifle. God I was pissed! You can bet your ass I duped the living shit out of modules, junk, Vault Steel and fluxes...
---
Now they need to restore the stacked foundation glitch so I can make my camp less buggy.
---
Get the armor first, then the mods. Can get the mods first but kinda pointless if you dont have the armor to mod it onto
---
It takes 30 minutes to get kicked from the game.. how long are your dumps?
---
Oh God I forgot about destinys respawn timed
---
Aslong as I still get 999 ammo clip per core with perks then I don't mind.. I carry 300 cores with me at all times so its an ez life
---
Although I do not see the same side of the coin, I value this opinion. Thanks for the comment 👍
---
Like everyone one said, there are absolutely only two ways that ANY object gets placed in your camp. 
---
1) you did it. 
---
2) someone in a private party with you did it. In this case it makes sense to not invite strangers or accept invites from strangers. Players in a public team with you can not place items at your camp.
---
Magic weapons still work in the pts, the listed damage doesn't mean anything with magic. It'll probably be worse.
---
Pretty sure it's a cross platform issue. No one cares if your on pc or not.
---
i had fun with it. i play a dude and still finished it. i did not keep any of the gear but i do make the phantom device still when i find full canisters.
---
i don't know why people don't talk about it. maybe because its a secrete society idk.

Did you check the missile silo holotape to verify?
---
For-ever, for-ever, for-ever
---
I had a problem too, it glitched out on leaving the mine and didn't give me any rewards at all, no flux, no treasury notes nothing at all!
---
It’s literally my fav quest in the game.
---
It's a console problem, hence pc master race.
---
Yeah that's the first thing I did. Says alpha has the cooldown and Charlie is clear, but this isn't the case.
---
Yeah but now it says my budget has been exceeded when i try and do anything. This game is fucking trash.
---
Yup. It’s like 4K~ gold just for the base plans without mods.
---
Lol nice edit. Except meaningless. I didn’t include an arbitrary amount- whatever your base weapon damage is IS your 100%
---
magic weapons will be worse or more people will abuse them?
---
Yeah, the Power Armor edition came with a replica T-51 Helmet, canvas/nylon bag, and several other things
---
Legendaries, Gold Bullion, caps and EXP all easy every hour
---
It's one of the best quests I've ever played in a game because it was just too fucking real. I never want to do it again.
---
So she’ll land if Bethesda fixes the event, basically?
---
Shhhhh.  I'm  dumb.  I understand where you went with your math.  I agree with this.  I think of percentages weirdly.
---
Gharghahm
---
You’re killing me smalls
---
Ya killin' me smalls
---
Magic weapons are even better performing since the damage nerf doesn't apply to them, so more people will use them.
---
I’d have enough for all of it right now... if there was a bullion limit per day🙄
---
It seriously is, like three SBQs frok what i could tell.
---
Whoops
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/513
---
i use both.  when im just farming and just roaming about on stay with my rifleman perks and lever action.    endgame i swap to my commando cards.
---
Sounds like Fallout. It really do be this way. It’s best to accept it won’t be an easy ride for a while until this fight has been out for months and they can figure shit out. It’s not right and they should do better but...
---
i think this all makes a lot of sense. imo since they capped the amount of players that can come in unlike the sbq, it would make sense for there to be some kind of level cap or something
---
Those are my essentials but feel free to look around. The glowing items mod is nice but a massive pain to load
---
I meant remaster it with the massive amount of graphic mods, optomizers, and unofficial patches.
---
You're talking about a **remake**. Remake and Remaster are two different things.
---
Not to be rude but you know it starts on the hour. Get there a little early. That's what my team does.
---
Yes they do, gatling lasers and plasma are effected by heavy weapons perks and the laser and plasma pistols with gunslinger and guerrilla.
---
Im running heavy gunner, vamps, any suggestions to get higher damage output? Have my 3 main on strength, glow sight, bloody mess and one man army. Mostly PA related in intelligence.
---
It starts on the hour.
---
You have a personal cooldown that's independent of the server cool down. If you run Charlie and server hop it will tell you it's ready on the holotape but won't let you actually launch there until your 3 hour cool down expires.
---
Reason I'm here just did the exact same thing and got the exact same result, I believe, the scorched flying around may play part on this scheme. Unsure tho but data suggests otherwise. This guys sat there for hours they were the ones that trigger that glitch? I got a ton of all the items to craft Ultracite ammo man sweet.
---
Thank you!
---
I've seen a couple of strats.  If you stand under the little chute where you first drop down, he can't hit you from there.  Also there's a little tunnel on the left.  He can't go inside there.  We like to all sit in there and just unload on him while one person stays on spawn duty.
---
Literally just had that happen. Got killed down there went to respawn, sat at loading screen for 5 minutes. Just killed the game and joined somebody on my recently played list. Get back into world and the event over.
---
Bruuhhhhh. My game crashed during the Colossus event and I wanted to do it again. Rip me I guess, I'm not leaving lmao
---
Seems they'd rather take the easy way out and just nerf everything the same.
---
Have they responded at all about the current nerf in pts?
---
SBQ is easier solo.
---
If your a sneak bloodied commando min-maxed earl is pretty easy and quick to do, however, SBQ is still a much faster and safer kill.
---
I made the mistake of buying butresed first but yes you need to get the plans first not the mods
---
I feel like about 1600 rounds of Ultracite 2mm are gojng to be lost very quickly once I can get on to try the event
---
I died 2 times respawn right back in the action..might of been plain luck
---
Okay! Thanks!
---
Indeed. So much hovering above planets...at least on PS4. I hear PC load times are not terrible.
---
Thanks bud, I thought it would be along those lines. There are a lot of hazards but I'm not complaining, it feels like an actual boss fight
---
Correct, but there is still a trunk with extra loot at the exit. It's worth making the run, IMO.
---
Didn't work unfortunately. Thank you for the suggestion though.
---
Queens a PITA with her not landing crap,but thats it. But earl is surrounded by an ass load on wendigos thag stagger you,fall rocks, hot floors,  and fear mechanics. 
---
Both take about the same damage, have the same life.
---
IMO the best part of the base vanilla game. One of the most original storylines of the game.
---
how do they work like what makes them magic?
---
I can solo SBQ in a mag, the sponge takes over 30k of magic ammo with the -20% ammo magazine.  Large quick burst over sustained for the sponge would be the only viable.
---
There should be level requirements both for being too high or being too low, or they should scale up or down in difficulty.   Easy for me to say, no idea how it could be done though.
---
Ahhh, thanks dude. I haven't completed the event without dying at the end lmao. I'll give it a go at some point
---
Maybe it’s 12 EDT then?
---
Thank you for the suggestion. The 'rebuilding database' of my PS4 didn't work, so I'm gonn ahave to delete and reinstall.

Hopefully this will keep my screenshots. It's not the end of the world if it doesn't obviously. But I love my loading screens reminding me of my 'Journey So Far'. It's such a wonderful feature that I'm suprised way more games with a photomode don't employ it.
---
Right? I normally listen to YouTube videos or music while I play, but this quest had me legitimately invested to the point where I didn't even want to listen to anything else. I'm afraid I did this quest too soon and it'll be downhill from here haha
---
I'm sure you're fine.  A full team like that and he'll melt.  I run bloodied guns, unyielding armor, and nerd rage/bloody mess.
---
They said there would be balances, not much else.
---
Missle silo state holotape...You get one when you’re doing the modus quest line...If you’re like me and dropped it or sold it, you can buy a replacement in the armory in Whitesprings bunker
---
Since you can’t drop them or anything I don’t know why they would want to do that?
---
I would think they would’ve shown most of their stuff at QuakeCon
---
Good luck took 144 meat cleavers in my sack so 48 meat week events. I got two back to back tonight so number 47 and 48.
---
I haven't tried killing the queen with Chems and stuff but it takes me a good few mags regardless. My issue is that I think I'll die a lot more so this sounds about right
---
Go to your holotapes. Look for missile silo holotape. I don’t remember if you automatically get that when you launch your first nuke, or if you had to buy it somewhere in the enclave bunker. But that will show you all 3 silos, along with how much time you have to wait until you can launch a nuke in each silo. 
---
So if somebody launched a nuke at site A, the holotape will say “28 minutes until you can launch again”
---
There’s a lot from Fallout 3 I would personally pay for to have as outfits and weapon skins
---
Instead of all the speculation, has anyone actually tried putting a Bullion item into a collectron for someone else to see?
---
No, but you can have a link to r/whogivesashit
---
Yep. You can nuke it 3 times on one server and trigger it each time. Just like the Queen event.
---
Ok. Day 1 feedback (PS4, Lvl 160), trying not to be durr durr Bethesda is dummm. But....this event is an extreme lack of creativity clearly designed to burn through several dozen stimpaks at a time. Throwing 30 Lvl 75 Wendigos and a Colossus in a small arena is not clever level design - at all. The number of simultaneous Wendigo spawns is utterly absurd. It’s not hard, and it’s not creative. It’s dumb and repetitive in the extreme. And I was successful both times - not sour grapes because I failed the event. Basic no-duh strategy is for the lower levels like me to run and distract the Spawns away to the edges of the arena while the 250+ players focus firepower on ol’ man long legs screamypants. Anyways - “tough” I guess,  but it’s really not creative to just drop an absurd amount of OP’d jumping enemies in a tiny space and call that good design. Not worth the 50 stimpaks it takes to survive. If explosives actually did any damage or knock back, and could be reloaded quickly - THIS is the fight for explosives specialists.
---
Earl definitely, SBQ is moving and flying constantly and Earl is stationary for the most part. His health melted way faster than the queens health does. You die during the Queen fight and her health comes back, die during Earls fight and it stays the same.
---
Thanks for the info! I had no idea that even existed
---
I had one when the bows were first released, but it was only a level 30 something, and since I only have 4 perception I just sold it for script.
---
Considering the number of delays A Colossal Problem has been through, for it to *still* lack even this basic functionality makes me wonder wtf is going on in-house. Then again, the SBQ fight is also open to everyone, so maybe they’re just carrying on the illogic.
---
I got downed just before taking it out. Respawned to “mine is collapsing” which killed me again. Respawned outside of the mine. Got an Event complete about 3 minutes later. 
---
3* Bloodied Reduced Weight Walking Cane
---
No worries man! My main has a full buttressed SS armor and its stronger then every but t-65 power armor.. I think lol
---
Its obviously Chally moo moo
---
How is this fight even worth it
---
So my anti armor bow and grognak axe should be good?  #BowGang
---
Can confirm. My account was hacked and I got notified of a suspicious login. Logged in right away and changed my password. I had godmode gear on my character plus a few duplicates of these godmode items. This was less than a week ago.
---
That's actually really good news. It seems easier to break stealth during the queen fight due to molerats and other small nuisances. Thanks for the heads up!
---
Haha fair enough
---
Leaving a comment because also need the spreadsheet.
---
I did it with 4 people i was a bloodied stealth commando and some other guy was using a explosive 50 cal
---
So I just did the math and I think I'm going to lose 2/3rds of my damage.  I'm sorry, but that's like, insane?
---
Just got done wkth my first one. Hes a tough SOB. We finished with 12 min or so left. I think it really depends on tour teammates. 
---
I focused on keep the spawns off other players so they dont get staggered and shot earl as much as i could in between.
---
Little brag cause it felt good: finished the event without using a single stimpack and im a handgunner , i forgot to take autostim armor off lastnight when i afked the meat week and it burned all my stims up 😅. My VE25 10mm on swap kept me alive lol.
---
Sweeeet! Thanks mate, off to nuke!
---
I feel your pain, it happened to me earlier. It’s even worst when you die and you seen them at the respawn point walking around.
---
Yea no problem. Keep in mind the timer is rounded by 15 minutes, so it’s not 100% accurate, although I’ve never had a problem with it. 
---
But yea before you waste your time going through a silo, do yourself a favor and check that holotape first. You don’t want to go through all that process only to find out you can’t launch a nuke :)
---
I tried to look very hard I didn't find anything before I posted this I made sure to do a search within Reddit to be honest I'm not really good with Reddit but I think I did it right
---
&gt;I did this event with only four people
---
Thats probably your issue. I've always done it with a full 8 people and have found it no harder than the SBQ. The Wendigo Spawn are really fucking annoying but as long as there's one bloodied build/legacy weapon/magic weapon player in the mine with you they're manageable. Anything less than max players would definitely be harder though. I personally never needed to bring more ammo than the SBQ, but even with 8 other people you still need to get your best armor and stock up on stimpacks. The Wendigo Spawn are relentless.
---
Same here, has never started again. Have done 50+ raider missions, bar won’t move. Suggestion to try alternating between the no reward/extra caps dialog?
---
I've was able to complete it 3 times before work and didn't even scratch it on my 4th time.. whatever build you got sink every bonus perk you can into is my advice.. going home to build a junkie build sense I've gotten a junkie 90% gatling laser and junkie 25% faster fire rate handmade.
---
&gt;Exception being bosses.
---
:)
---
Trashcan Carla, all time favorite. She reminds me of my mom
---
I've been AFK'ing the drums for a day or two (I probably got kicked to main menu because if colossal problem update) because I cant be home to play and I still want the meat week rewards. Also, it lets people complete the event way quicker
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ic325u/colossal_problem_event_rewards_and_datamined/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
I’ve forgotten to check the holotape multiple times...it sucks. I’m not sure which is worse though, forgetting the keycard or not checking the holotape
---
I stumbled into this for the first time today. I have a shotgun build and use an ultracite galling laser for SQB but only get it out for that. So there I am, two shot combat shotgun and X-01 armor spilling rounds and spamming stims. At one point the colossus killed everyone but me and a level 49 but we managed to stay with it until everyone made it back. It was intense and I won't be going in with just a shotgun again.
---
You still have to fast travel there....
---
My events keep failing cuz idiots get OFF the drums to stare at the sky 🙄
---
There's videos like the angry turtle one that explain it properly, certain effects, high fire rate or shotgun style weapons and a high frame rate make them magic.
---
He's got sick flair.
---
Its just annoying sometimes trying to simply hop a curb of sorts and jumping into an awning or something above.
---
But he got marsupial it sounds like specifically for that reason so maybe others enjoy that exciting gameplay mechanic where you have to try and time your jump and horizontal speed perfectly to slip into crevices and entrances.
---
I will say hold for normal jump would probably be better than my initial suggestion
---
i saw nuke at the cave and was gonna do it before work. Is somebody else nuking it not enough to let others in or was mine bugged?
---
It’s the same shitty mapping issue as the gold hm skin which they could never fix.
---
30k players online on average. So many vendors.
---
You know... uhm... Fallout 76 takes place over 100 years before the enclave gets destroyed... 
---
Play Fallout 1 and 2. Old games for sure but the setting and the whole story with all its content and lore and how the wastelands look will give you a blast. 
---
Use the unofficial patch for Fallout 1 and the killap patch for Fallout 2. 
---
After you finished both games you will see how Bethesda destroyed or let’s say... changed everything. Fallout after 1 and 2 is basically recycled, new written but not continued.
---
Yup, not a lot of cover in earls fight but sneaking and moving will keep ya hidden. Lot of multitasking too paying attention to where you’re walking making sure you don’t step in his radioactive piss. Ha ha ha 
---
(Queen moves way too fast and is pretty far away most times and the damage drop off hurts a lot, but Earl moves slow and you can get close to him and just riddle him with bullets. That fight was fun, can’t wait to do it again.
---
&gt;rtle one that explain it properly, certain effects, high fire rate or shotgun style weapons and a hi
---
Yikes i see
---
And that shit is wrong we as players should not expect this from any game builder I don't fucking care who makes or builds the game but they all should have to answer for there shortcoming and sorry for coming on your post and saying this but the same thing happen to me and in my book, this is not right.
---
I went in blind the first time and ended up running out of ammo. Melee'd the hell out of some wendigos and walked away with a 3 star pole hook.
---
New character?
---
It's was fun I'll give you that! I wish there was a little more time to collect my spoils of war but I guess that would take away from the "big escape". I doubt I will run the event very often given the ridiculous amount of ammo I had to expend. 3000+ 2mm EC rounds and all I get was a cursed shovel?
---
We just need an auction house type system like most mmorpgs have I've wanted this for a long time myself but I wouldn't hold my breath.
---
Do those events and gamble with the Purveyor. 
---
You're likely to spend weeks or longer just trading random weapons. You not only have to find something someone wants, but you also have to find a person who has what you want. 
---
Example: I traded away a B2525 combat rifle for a two star minigun because it fit a hole in my collection. I've also traded okay guns for super rare plans because the other player didn't want to deal with finding the absolute maximum bidder. 
---
RNG can just drop amazing things into your hands, so do both.
---
Condolences, I feel your pain...
---
You need to buy the parts first. Chest. Left arm. Right arm. Left leg. Right leg. Just so you can craft it. Which you will need legendary modules in order to craft it in the first place. 
---
I suggest you worry about that first. And then worry about crafting and getting a legendary effect on that armor piece that you actually want. 
---
Once you have all armor pieces on you, and they have the legendary effects you want. Then you can buy the mods you want for each piece. 
---
Sure you can just go and buy the mods and get it out of the way. But I think it makes more sense to buy the pieces first. Get the pieces you know you’ll wear and keep. And then modify it. But each to their own.
---
The dreamers, they die, but the dream lives on?
---
Thank you, someone finally gets it! I got a friend who needs a Bloodied fixer, he doesnt care about legacy's or shit like that. I dont know why everyone and thier mom is such a whore for items they arent even gonna use!
---
Or at least a proper trade system like most mmorpgs. Confirmation screens for trades isn't a new idea, been out since Diablo 2.
---
If they are in passive mode camp items dip to 1 hp then right back up to what it was before you tried to destroy it automatically. Its ppl with explosive bait you gotta watch out for. Those cause actual dmg to camp items, without making said griefer hostile/wanted
---
I'm pretty sure there's a gamescom at home schedule on bethesda.net.
---
Edit: here https://bethesda.net/en/article/4Kt5yMgR8TLFRW2dpyfdDs/tune-in-to-our-gamescom-at-home-stream
---
Is there? I have had days where I would drop 3 nukes on queen, hop servers on the last queen kill and drop 3 more. Never really felt like I had to wait 3 hours if I server hopped
---
This is one Issue Bethesda fails to address properly.
---
Yeah, I planned on doing this!  I was just confused on the wording of each individual item and what the plan was for exactly.  Thanks for the advice!
---
Because you did not search this subreddit for "Mistress of Mystery" ?
---
Ive never seen the game completely pixelated like that before though. Even in awful laggy queen events.
---
No I seriously don't accept random team invites. I'm aware of how these things happen. That is why this is a mystery.
---
Just beat it again (four times total), very fun and good design. Just pound it with all you have you should be able to do it. Use the structures and objects as your cover. And if someone can focus on getting rid of the spawns, it could be a lot quicker. I found myself getting distracted half of the time because I have to stop shooting Earle and deal with the numerous spawns a lot.
---
Doesnt work on me lol
---
I think it checks anything it was shot with. I was using my gatling gun and picking up 5mm and 2mm, someone else had the Gauss.
---
That's true. That and his weird lava discharge. I thought the scream attack would be more devastating but it seems like I'm still in stealth even when I'm running around like a banshee because nothing noticed me.
---
Yeah, she has the tendency to forget what's going on and decides to scream at other mobs. Same here, I've had the mining mask twice in a row now but I'm worn out
---
I think my bloodied HW build went down by roughly half. I haven’t really dug in to investigating to see exactly how each multiplier works in to it.
---
It’s not really insane when you look at the overall damage problems Bethesda is dealing with. I’m planning on making a post about that soon, explaining the problems Bethesda has, and how they’re trying to fix them (and how this damage change should be 1. Just a *start* and 2. Not set in stone.)
---
I then proceeded to explain why even against bosses a good Bloodied build shouldn’t die. Somebody’s cherrypicking.
---
One of 76 finest moments. 
---
Even when it got too long and boring it was even more funny. Like a Family Guy joke.
---
And a 3* legendary drop
---
who gives a spacesuit with no helmet? houston, we've had a problem
---
We need both. Item for item trading should have been a thing since day 1...
---
If old runescape can do it and has forever why cant fallout haha
---
Dogmeat ?
---
I've only fought it once and my team (and me?) weren't anything to write home about. Took around 20 minutes. I was running a bloodied/stealth one handed melee build and only died one time "legitimately." As in died because I got feared into hazards and died before I could stimpak. Died another 3 times because toward the end of the fight the OG Xbox One cannot handle the amount of Wendigo spawns, falling debris, fire, screen clutter, etc. It was brutal. Stimpaks weren't working. VATS would take a couple seconds to start up. You name it. Not a fun time.
---
Overall, the event is enjoyable up until the fps starts tanking. I could kill all the Wendigos in one hit while my team focused the boss, so I went on mob control duty and only hit the boss when no adds were up.
---
Talking about fps problems... I couldn't even loot half the boss drops when it died. Spent about 20 seconds spamming A on the body only to get like half the pile and barely made it to the exit.
---
I normally just look at r/fallout. Sorry if I offended you or something lol
---
Ooh nice that’s a 5% chance to drop! You on PS4? I’d love to buy the spare.
---
Thank u
---
Kite with melee? Were you sneaking up and hitting and then running back then? I suppose that would be ideal, but the window of time would be very short, no? I would go in and just attack as much as possible before taking damage, or when the stim would proc I would take that as a cue to fade back and work on wendigos
---
I used to have Farmhand Power Armor, then I got my knee caught in the thresher.
---
One of my builds is a shotty build and I tag the angry ostrich a couple times then focus on keeping spawns off the heavies.
---
Can we get an update dedicated to more weapon mods?
---
If you are doing this event make sure you are teamed  up with fellow people who want to do it, did it just then where two of my teammates didn't travel to it and the one who did did nothing to earl, wasn't too bad to solo him myself but highly recommend that people like I did dont be stingy and use your good stuff like psychotats or its gonna take a lot of ammo
---
As a player that’s been here since BETA. I like events that are quick, DONT require a lot of work. And give me decent loot. 
---
Almost 90% of the cookout that I have joined have been completed under 30 seconds. I turn in my prime meat, pick up 1-2 plants and boom! The event is done. I get a random pathetic legendary that I’ll sell for script. I get a random plan that I already know, or maybe I’ll get lucky with a new one. And I get treasury notes. Not to mentioned since I’m on a team I’ll get a lot of extra xp. And a decent amount of caps.
---
Hey can plz anyone gift me fo76 i really wanna try it out plz. Thx for ur time readin this annoyin comment ik,but i really wanna try it out and i cant buy it at the moment..
---
I bring the boom, you bring the bang. You pew pew the colossus while I toast the adds.
---
Can anyone confirm if this would work with a TSE .50 cal and the magic armor piece?
---
Just photomode into it
---
It's not limited to teslas, and it's not limited to ACP.
---
No worries, I don't think that anyone starts this game with an intimate knowledge of everything in it. It's got a steep learning curve and in many respects it's needlessly complex. You've got a lot of opportunity to gain any perk cards you want and to move your perk points around  in any way you choose as you progress in the game.
---
I misread, sorry. I kite with ranged.
---
If you’re going to try and put people down, perhaps *you* should get *your* facts right.
---
Awesome, so it looks like it’s worth it to keep trying. Thanks!
---
I only went down once, for me I have a gauss shotgun that melts in vats. Even then the widigos can overwhelm you
---
SBQ
---
Not offended at all, and maybe I could have phrased it better on my end but there are a lot of posts about that quest line and it was discussed a lot back when, its a long time favorite.
---
When all you need is the grill... and some guy is selling it for 50 caps at his vendor.
---
I mean, 6 shots to kill a super mutant instead of 2 is annoying.  6000 instead of 2000 for the queen is insane.
---
Yeah they really need to look in to the mechanics of that. Not really much time to loot
---
If the event started the door gets blocked back up once 8 people have entered
---
Yup. Now road I think about it, it might be 2 hours, but they're definitely a personal cooldown.
---
got like 4 maybe 5 minutes after its nuked to get in afterwards nope
---
You have to fast travel into the event when it pops (exclamation mark). It doesn't allow walk-ins.
---
The nuke should trigger an event icon on the mine that is fast-travelable for 5 minutes
---
And a lost&amp;found, for when I kill a legendary mole rat or rad scorpion just as it burrows and there is nothing to loot.
---
Who did the voice over for that Event? She's wonderful.
---
If u dont escape u can loot without issue and ur just set outside the cave
---
Not all of us.
---
it's like the food court at Aventura mall
---
3.
---
But they still got rid of attaching walls to roofs/floor tiles so now you can't build down anymore, there are existing structures where you can't build up, but building down to fill in broke walls and roofs is the way to go.
---
The edit function is a wonderful thing isn’t it? 10 hours ago it was 30 games till that happened.
---
Sometimes baboons will nuke the train station up there, but if you build a little northwest of that station you should be in the clear (at that point the nuke wouldn’t be able to connect on the mine and ur camp)
---
I just wanna blast them myself
---
I’ve been noticing a lot of posts about this topic recently. And most comments are pretty much the same. If you’re giving stuff for free. Then it’s free. For whoever wants it. Even if you put a sign that says “for low level players only” it doesn’t mean people will care about it. 
---
If I saw your camp and it had free 10mm ammo I’ll totally take it. I’m an unarmed and shotgun build. But I use my 10mm submachine gun ok low level enemies. So if I can get free ammo without paying or having to craft it I’ll definitely take it. 
---
Plus, you never really know what people will do with your ammo. Maybe that level 400 you saw will use it for himself. Maybe he will sell it and make some caps with it. Or maybe he/she has a friend that uses that ammo. Low/high level and they will give it to them.
---
Oh shit, really!? I'm not but it's definitely one of my favourite pieces of clothing. The miners lamp is actually functional
---
Good to know! Thanks.
---
What are good effects to go for on a commando build? I'm wanting to give it a shot but don't want to do a Bloodied Or Junkies build.
---
It probably would be fun to work on a floating camp VS the ‘Nope, that’s floating. Nope, that’s intersecting with another object. Oh, did I show that as green? It’s secretly red,’ that grinds your will into paste when you build on the ground. Just can’t bring myself to do it, though.
---
Forgive me. I’m on mobile so it doesn’t tell me if it’s been edited or not.
---
Yes that is a stupid question.
---
Freaking trap camps man, the other day I fell for one right by the meat cook event spawn, he stole all my junk very fast, so I took inspiration from this reddit and stayed dead on his porch, he messages me he was role playing as a raider and I answer i was rol playing as a dead body on his front door, soon there was a pile of dead players staying put in the front of his camp, it was kinda hilarious tbh, but yeah I get you, hope your dog is doing better and try to not let asshats upset you
---
I cheesed Good Grief by doing PVP in a private server with a friend. We just killed each other over and over until the trophy popped for both of us. Made things way easier than going into Nuclear Winter.
---
Legacies and Teslas have been around for ages and never caused this, this is a problem introduced by Patch 21 and effects whole servers!
---
I couldn’t, i had emptied all my ammo in dear Earle 🤣
---
God almighty I ran that event almost every waking hour for the entire two weeks and I didn’t get a single fucking rare mask, I don’t want to hear that music again 😂
---
Welcome to 76
---
I took him down to about 25%  by myself...took 50% of his health before timer was up..5 mins more and his ass was mine!!!!!
---
It causes lag there and in Radiation Rumble
---
Anti armor explosive
---
I believe I read somewhere that it is live now!! I don’t play console tho so can’t confirm
---
Yup
---
Is that part of the something sentimental quest?
---
Here and there. What I’ve noticed most is that if I fast travel to someone’s camp then it’s *very* slow to load in, to the extent that I could easily run forward and jump into any building before they materialise around me. That was never the case before.
---
I don't think you can. Or if you can it heals fast. I have a quad ammo shotty with +50% limb damage all shotgun perks and crit perks and I couldn't stop the screaming. At least not for long.
---
You...you *drop* screws?!
---
I died too many times to pick anything up lol got to the point where I had to wait like 45 seconds to re-spawn
---
How is he killing you? Are you actively engaging him with pvp on?
---
There is no bloodied nerf. Not only that, with overall damage nerfs, bloodied becomes more and more the only option to deal damage
---
Spent almost 5000 rds of 50 cal and 7 fusion cores
---
Congrats! I completed 76 like a week or so ago - grinding up to be a solid enough level to do the settler raid felt like a slog.
---
I've considered doing Fallout 4 but the very thought of getting some of those trophies puts me right off, like the 100,000 tickets.
---
When is Gamescom again?
---
I enjoyed it as well until the other guy that was in with me quit... 
---
like I know it would be difficult with 2 people but come on... the wendigo spawns are great for farming.
---
I’m with you, haven’t gotten them either. I finally got the backpack plan today after so many fucking events, and I still haven’t gotten those outfits. RNG is such a crap way of doling out rewards, reminds me of Fasnacht. I ran that event constantly both last year and this year and not a single rare mask.
---
There is a really cool pre existing structure tower thing set amongst some raider ruins on the railroad tracks south of the mine in the hills above monagh.  I recently put my camp there and it's right on the very edge of the nuke zone. Basically you're at the mercy of however is tossing the nuke but out of 5 launches today I only had one that included my camp and I was able to jump off the server in time. Saw some pretty incredible explosions the other times.
---
Thanks. I’d expect nothing less from a raider.
---
That... no. I mean a legitimate way that doesn’t involve using a glitch.
---
I think I spent all my RNG karma on Fasnacht... got all the masks and stuff then, and zilch nothing at all from the caravans.. ha. Good on getting the backpack plan though!
---
How many people total?
---
This is probably a whole other can of worms, but I honestly prefer 76 over 4. 
---
I think 76 improves on almost every problem I had with 4, except maybe story. 
---
Now I just want Bethesdas' writers to stop treating the series like a parody with and actually write something better than a middle school drama student.
---
"Dark humor" doesn't mean fart jokes and skeletons.
---
Also melee weapons seem to be having a different issue which supposedly was reported and being worked on.
---
It's unarmed that got dumpstered, not bloodied.
---
Yes. Can verify. Have purchased and applied to torso and limbs, and all are working. Happy to get the extra 50lbs
---
Does Earle disappear after you kill him or am I blind? You don’t loot him it’s just the event rewards?
---
The respawn bug is a thing.
---
I actually had spawn overtake me chasing my friend because of how low my agility was - even while spamming nukas.
---
those respawn timers gotta go
---
You might be blind or the game may have glitched, his body just collapses like any other enemy
---
5/8
---
You lucky motherfucker
---
i read all that stuff pretty obsessively, i was a big fan of fallout 4, which is why i’m giving this game a go in spite of its bad rep. one of the main things that i like about rpg style games are the choices, but i felt like i had little choice but to gun down the mutated protesters to proceed with that level, and it just felt too unsettling to do it, what with real protesters getting shot at here and abroad.  i’m down to hear people’s thoughts, i guess that’s why i originally posted, to hear opinions about the level from others, and what they think about it in whatever terms.  it feels weird to support a game that might not have issues with shooting monster protesters, but i haven’t played the level through, maybe there’s some grand message at the end that makes it all worth while. any thoughts on that?
---
GT?
---
I'd argue the opposite, you are punished less for not using bloodied. Bloodied gets hit the hardest, so relatively speaking it is more on par with everything else. The game is already piss-easy anyway, so the only place this even matters is against event bosses, but this just means that other builds can contribute more
---
Yup, it’s the most rare item from that event. 
---
(Like I said I’d love to buy the extra off ya if you’re on PS4. Just name a price and I’ll save up for it.)
---
I thought you were going to quit playing?... you know becuase Bethesda "Lied" about delaying the Colossal Problem event again or whatever you were bitching about less then a week ago... see Frank, 4 days wasnt along time.
---
I haven't played in like 2 days. But kept falling the prime meat event is it glitched?
---
100+ only imo
---
I'd be down, unfortunately probably won't be able to do anything for another 3 hours. Level 270 PA Heavy Junkie build, GT Black Cringe.
---
This should be a difficult event for casuals. Those of us who put work into our builds should be the ones dealing more damage. If it was easy for the casuals, then we wouldn't need to grind for our gear and weapons.
---
Starts August 27th but it looks like the Fallout stuff is on the 29th.
---
Here you go

I just finished legendary run today as well.  Gonna take the next two weeks off mostly besides some flux farming which I need again thanks to the dark matter chassis I'm making.   Then I'll be refreshed for season 2.  Just hope they add more ways to earn SCORE
---
Please, I’d gladly trade the backpack for a Father Winter Mask. I want that stupid ass mask with every fiber of my being. If I don’t get it next year I’ll quit the game, it’s that serious 😂
---
I only take workshops for the daily challenge 
---
they not worth the hassle of being griefed by assholes
---
Good to hear, thank you for that.
---
It could be something to do with the multiplier. I know that going between headshots and bodyshots ruins it, but going between different limbs has been inconclusive since most enemies either move around too much or die too quickly
---
I mean, in the PTS before it released, that harpoon gun had fire rate instead
---
Or they should make it to where if you aren't the right level for the event it doesn't let you join, make the level requirement not recommended but mandatory, sure people might be angry about it, but it's in the name, *end game player event*.
---
 
---
Also if they find away around it because there might be a way if they do join the event it won't trigger for them and they will be unable to trigger it in their pip-boy therefore will remove the ability for them to get rewards or XP.
---
Yes this might sound a little harsh to do to the new fish but they aren't ready for the big bait, if they do the new stuff right out of the vault what else will there be for them to do latter on.
---
For all the low levels out there 1-59 take your time do the main quest, soon one wasteland will come and power leveling will no longer be a thing best to wing you from it now
---
It's for a colossus problem quest
---
Unfortunately were lookimg for people now.
---
If theres people on the drums, you can solo the event.
---
That's weird.. only just a little over a gig on my Xbox one x. Why the size difference?? That's crazy.
---
All good man. Figured I would put myself out there.
---
I believe it's already patched on the PTS.
---
For me it’s not about farming (even tho I’ll admit screws are the main crafting material I’m missing lol), it’s just a fun event in general
---
Deep pocketed is for sale today at vault 79.
---
For me it would be the Scout Mask... haven’t seen it at all even once in the player vendors.. 😂
---
Still buggy af
---
Im 25 score away from finishing, just couldn't do anymore today.
---
I have lots of supplies hoarded for atlas, and I'm still grinding raider quests. But I can't imagine playing every day like I have been
---
Not only do you have to get the tenderizer plan.. you also have to get the tenderizer mod plans.
---
Show me an MMO that makes money... that isn't mobile, that time gates almost everything worth while. Just capitulate man, you're going to do it in some months anyways, welcome to FO76 btw.
---
So I usually run a rifleman build but last night I got the commando perks as I felt I would be less useless. My damn rifle broke three times during the fight :/ is this normal? Also does explosive damage not hit bosses at all? I’ve noticed it does nothing on the SBQ and it seems to be not hitting Earlie either..
---
I’m still having an issue with the quest for the camera. I got my camera a while ago, but I still have a quest to investigate Anne/Ansel. When I inspect the corpse, there’s nothing on the body. Therefor I can not complete the quest, and the quest is permanently stuck in my pip boy.
---
It has a high difficulty level but I can’t say I agree. There’s a covered area you can hide beneath and blast on him without much trouble. The wendigo spawn go down pretty fast. I’d agree on the ammo part, but then again the SBQ is a big ammo dump too. The most annoying part for me was having to run out at the end when I wanted to loot.
---
My fps was around a baker's dozen if I recall correctly, but it felt even worse than that. I was using a quad combat shotgun after that and still couldn't really hit anything without vats. It felt like it wasn't just the framerate, but there was an additional delay on top of that. Since consoles already have a hard time with the base game, I can see them dropping into single digit frames with this
---
I haven’t played in a while but these mutants don’t have near enough 308s to satisfy the LMG.
---
Sorry you got downvoted by foodbuilds.
---
And make sure to kill the wendigo spawn otherwise they. will. C O L L E C T.
---
Eric Cartman: "now we can play the game"
---
Yes it's available now. 500 bullion and you get the plan for all the limbs. The torso plan is seperate and has been there since Wastelanders dropped.
---
Thanks! This was the video I was referencing but I didn’t see a note on the powerfist which is why I brought it up. If it’s in there I must have missed it, I’ll watch that section again.
---
Cranberry Bog prime cut event will provide LOADS of XP for the repeatable points, especially in a Building team. Might cut a day or two off the grind.
---
Yes all of this. It’s enough that I drag my low level friends to the SBQ right, why can’t high levels have this one thing that only we can vibe out and do?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDnqYDoYkbQ
---
It...literally tells you that it opens you up to PvP.
---
It really was tbh
---
Love ACP, please pass it on to the dev team!
---
Reminded me of that funny paperchase quest from the witcher 3 dlc where you had to fill out a bunch of forms from different employees in a bank.
---
So one could use explosive to weaken structures then finish them off with explosive bait
---
Yep, since EverQuest... 2003 bud. None of them did this... no idea what trash you kids play today but this is mobile predatory bs. This game is like a feeding trough for cattle, they even gave you all cattle outfits lol. 
---
Like hamsters to the feeder pellet, you line up every day, get your pittance and log out. How do i know? Been around since the start of this mess, you can fanboi all day idc, but don't blow smoke up my arse pal. You're running the hamster wheel. Face it. 
---
Yeah i was there for TBC, i rolled a Forsaken Lock, good times buddy. Mount grind was easier but everything else i did, likely made your rotations look like grammar school so move along.
---
what’s that?
---
Pocketed were always there, deep pocketed I bought today (on Xbox)
---
It's the teslas and the way the ash and goo piles are working/not working.
---
Did it a second time with 8 and a guy that had a flamer that melted life off almost as fast as I do a 1 star SB.
---
Once I figured out he was kicking out the damage I relegated myself to killing spawns.
---
Only burned about 3k in ammo but we were successful, got the plushy, never doing it again.
---
 Thanks.
---
Thx anyway.
---
I seem to get nothing but 308 and shottys, tons of shells.
---
If you read what I said I do have a habit of not reading things so I know that part is on my end... still the whole idea is ridiculous when you think about it... me being a small level just trying to get supplies and I get trashed by people who probably have all the supplies they need and just kill ppl because it’s “fun”... I’m not saying I wasn’t In the wrong I’m just saying it’s a little unnecessary.
---
I’m sorry that sucks ass but I laughed my ass off when I opened Reddit and that was the first thing that popped up XD
---
Okay well legitimate Teslas are doing this as well.
---
It sucks to die close to the end, not sure how that could be fixed. Happened to me the first time I played it.
---
Probably a similar 30-40% nerf
---
This. Fix the problems introduced by patches instead of removing said weapons.
---
thanks for the info yall
---
Yes they are. It’s just multiplied when they don’t have to reload and the Tesla just bucks unlimited
---
I keep 38 at 0 caps in my vendor, it usually gets to about 6 or 700 and someone just cant help themselves and takes it all. I dont mind, maybe he is running about and handing it directly to newbies. Maybe they are are helping newbies level up and using a pipe pistol to wear down a target without over doing it. Never know.
---
GET 'EM OUT BOYS, WE DID IT!!
---
I have a magic Junkie Guass minigun, it’ll still be good cause magic, but worse because junkies won’t be as good
---
Got it. Thank you.
---
if people keep buying items with money dupers will always exist sadly.
---
are you guys on XBX 1X or is it the base console?

Easy treasury notes/skript/legendaries/exp
---
The abundance of screws easily beats anything in the chest.
---
You can ask this about a dozen different bugs in this game. Damage bug(s), challenge auto-completion, respawn, fast travel, enemy loot dropping as world items, invincible disabled enemies, workshop enemies spawning stuck under the map, falsely flagged legendary enemies...most of this stuff has been an issue for over a year and impacts crucial gameplay elements. How is it not higher priority?
---
I agree 100%. Events (at least ones with a hard player cap) should have a *required* level, not a recommended one.
---
Upvote for unironically using All-Rise
---
cool story bro
---
It looks different and has a higher ER than a normal T-51b helmet. You learn how to craft them after picking it up the first time, so it should be safe to scrap it. I crafted a level 50 version for myself at one point. The helmet is the only part, there's not a complete set.
---
uhhhhhh hundred percent!
---
lowkey i scrapped that shit- it's unique but if u don't like it then fuck it
---
As a shotgun main, it's nice to see 25 shells on almost every Wendigo Spawn I kill.  
---
Plus all the screws, which I always was on a shortage of but now sitting on almost 700.
---
I’m pretty sure it’s just a skin for the t-51 helmet I think that’s all
---
The disparity between weapon damage is the most unbalanced aspect of the game. If someone can solo the two end game bosses in under a minute (in seconds when in comes to the SBQ) while other people with what would be considered normal builds can struggle with the full 8 (in the case of ACP) to beat it, that’s a disparity. 
---
Everyone wants more stash, but considering every online game comparable to FO76 has some limit on what you can hold it’s not particularly surprising.
---
I've had it happen occasionally too.  Some seem to have it worse than others.
---
i was trying to find the reddit thread talking about it, but it was a while back, then i tried finding the fallout soundtrack, but there are removed songs that might be it, then i looked up the song itself, here it is:
---
https://youtu.be/6p2z5CGCrJM
---
there are no more parts it's just a paint job for the helmet and that's it
---
i dont think so. Went in just me and another guy and after 3 or so mins he quit cuz we hadn't done much damage.
---
Ah. So it’s basically a different skin or look for the t-51 helmet. Got it. Thank you.
---
Surprise, it would make too much sense to be with the other mounted objects- It's under the gorrila tab because its a floor prop
---
Good to know, appreciate the response.
---
Confusion moment :0
---
Agreed!  100+ screws is a nice little bonus.
---
Why? I haven’t read up on the changes.
---
Sometimes it happens. The servers don't support that many people anyway.
---
I had a whole gaggle of sub 50s. Massive failure
---
In this house we love All Rise! Fr though, it is my favorite weapon in the game.
---
I can actually handle myself pretty well against the colossus solo. Key word is /handle/. Did I do any meaningful damage? No. Did tank most of it's hits for no reason cause no one else was there to do anything with the fact that I was pulling aggro? Yeah, but the only other guy that was there peaced out when he realised that you need more than just 2 people to do ANYTHING. Were most of my deaths due to poison/fire damage cause I run bloodied? You bet your sweet bippy.
---
Please god do not do this event alone or with a minimal amount of people, if you don't see people show up then don't bother, this thing will rip you a new one.
---
Whether said new one comes from corrosion, burns, or just the colossus deciding to kick your shit in. You will get a new one and that monstrous mug will send you all the way to the capital wasteland hollering for your mama.
---
I have one too. It gave me like 15 more energy resist over my basic t51 helmet. Might wanna check stats before scrapping.
---
No, but if you want to see me them again they stay in the game files
---
Well. My instigating .50 hunting rifle no longer one shots, it takes around 3 bullets to kill a single super mutant. So there's no point.
---
Lmao wtf.. I found it. Thanks!
---
Yes, but with better stats.
---
Did the exact same thing in red dead redemption 2 lol
---
I died three times.first time instant respawn the second it was about 10 seconds.rewspawned in the mine as well just jumped back down.again I think I'm hella lucky 3rd time I died by debri once we looted earl.respawned outside but got the flux notes and cursed harpoon.so tonight cards stacked in my favor I guess
---
I have to try that, I have a VE1a fixer that I have been trying to get a read on. As a bloodied build those respawn times were getting harder each time. After about 7 events I find really watching for the roof cave ins (red light beams and bubbles) I do much better not dying.
---
Yea I believe Bethesda even stated it was a high level event
---
BRO DELETE THIs
---
Oh I remember this. But wasn’t this a bug? Like they capped the damage on accident so that you only deal 1/3 damage on enemies rather than full? 
---
If not that seems like a stupid decision that needs changing.
---
I have PTS... but i take meds for it
---
When you pick it up you also learn how to craft it so no need to keep it in your stash if not using it.
---
Suggested a similar idea last month for reusing the instanced top of the world some, and even got some traction on it. Sadly, Bethesda only acknowledges the bug reports. Even then, it’s usually just a generic response. I think the time of them listening to redditor ideas has ended
---
You have to break the code and do a bunch of bull crap to figure out the code just look it up online.
---
Well I guess that’s why they call it magic damage. Well never figure out the trick unless we’re the magician
---
Not in my experience. Meter went down fast when I was the only one collecting stuff
---
Not only 8 people though - 8 people per instance.  The entire server could do the event if they wanted.
---
Apparently put it in and leave the building and re-enter.
---
Yeah I just spin the spit whenever I get tired, I clock out and assume I'm helping someone.
---
I've 100% NV on Xbox, FO4 on both Xbox and Steam, and had 76 launched on Steam I would've 100% that already too. I have to make a new character to do main story quests and level up to get those achievements 😭. I need to 100% 3 and NV on Steam one of these days.
---
Have you done the Enclave quest “I am become death”? Or maybe this silo was on cool down 🤔
---
But here a helpful site https://nukacrypt.com
---
Literally most of the event I’m more focused on staying alive in fear of this happening.
---
Just another of the thousands of problems with weapons skins and atomic shop shit
---
No, the most it should be is 50. A level 50+ can do the same damage out put as a level 100+
---
You aint doing the event right then... trash piles, grass fires, chally poop all reduce the meter down. Take care of the trash piles first as they dont respawn, manage fires and poop while farming meat and greens... EzPz even easier if there are people on te drums becuse it reduces the drop rate futher
---
S talkers
---
W eapons
---
A re
---
G ood
---
I’m not bloodied. And I agree with OP. I’m just now getting my SSA plans bought. A min long wait is ridiculous!
---
Right but do you need to enter them to decode it on a computer in Game?
---
I have spicy and peppered so I am covered on that front.
---
Is it a set cap? Like nuke is launched, first 8 get in and that's it? I kinda felt that when people are entering the event, it would create as many instances as needed so that no one is excluded from participation.
---
Stims wouldn't even work after spamming the button then when I respawned he did his annoying scream and my character ran into the drill, lost out on loot and screws
---
But at least I got the reclaimed mask I never even wanted....
---
Theoretically, but a level 100+ has an actual build that can do real damage compared to an unorganized level 50
---
Maybe Purveyor Murmrgh could have a little lost and found box near to her trading booth. One that gathers lost legendaries and is individual to each player.
---
The box would have to have its own weight cap of course or people would just use it for unlimited storage, but I think it’d work. Maybe lore wise she can smell legendary enemies and burrows to the locations of lost items to bring them back I dunno.
---
I guess the question is why do I keep getting no access when I go to alpha silo?
---
Thanks so much
---
You'd think that if -anyone- would have survived the Scorched catastrophe in the vanilla story, it would have been some of the Free Staters in their bunkers and a handful of these ladies in their secret hideout. They really need to bring back the faction.
---
You get it from colossal problem.  Takes five spoiled meat to craft one
---
Ballistic Bock, Psychotats, Overdrive, Small Guns Bobblehead, Guns and Bullets 3, and anything else you can think of to improve your damage output and survivability.   Stay in stealth as much as possible if you can.  Kill the ads ASAP.  Stay out by the walls and in the tunnel so you don't get pelted with burning debris or screamed into the drill.  There is also a semi-safe zone right where you fall into the mine.  Fire a burst, move, fire another burst.. repeat.  Don't try to take on Earle head on unless he is crippled.   There isn't really any trick to it, you just have to stay alive and bring your A game.  Do what you can do and protect your team, two guns is always better than one so keep your mates alive.
---
Sounds about right
---
I couldn’t figure it out to be honest
---
That’s my thought too.
---
I got one. The atomic shop one looks better.
---
I have but not because of me. It completed I guess because a player on my team did the quest and launched a nuke and that completed it for me? But I have never launched a nuke. And yes, I have done all the Enclave quests.
---
Weird tho cause that’s not even a lot, and even easier to just make by time jumping. If he’s anything like the folks at /r/animalcrossing he’ll just have cut out around half his games playtime really
---
Still need people?
---
How about a, D-
---
I think so.
---
That’s what I’m trying to do. Is trade it, I’m not asking saying tomepne would be a complete fucking ripoff for people to just give
---
It away. But I want a chance here. I don’t have much to give. And it’s way too RNG to get the damn thing myself
---
I dont know if this helps or even true, The events that I solod or managed to "donate" the most meat/greens I got the rarer drops.... prob just coincedence
---
Ah okay, sad I can’t just put them back on seeing I’m on PlayStation but they are in my Psn capture gallery.
---
More xp from the mobs. Assuming you aren’t in a rando group that downs the boss very quickly, a coordinated group can farm the windingos for good xp and screws to boot
---
Just gonna DDOS low levels then. 🤗 Low levels ruining the event gotta go. Either they can voluntarily not join or be forced out the server for a few minutes..
---
The first time I played it (tonight) we failed the event and I was playing with a level 230 and a level 120. We didn’t even get half health for the colossus before the timer ran out. I also kept dying and having to wait 60 seconds to spawn back in. That made me mad and it makes me not want to play the event again for awhile. What is the best tactics to fight the boss for those of you who completed the event?
---
It’s mainly just something different. We’ve had the queen for so long, we needed a different end game boss.
---
At least it wasn't nocturnal.
---
Nocturnal-something ultracite laser pistol on Earle. Ugh.  Event gave me a GS fss agility baseball bat. Ugh again.  :(
---
that's kind of the point
---
Did you receive anything specific as a reward? I'm wondering what her reactions are for the 3 options and if she continues on with that dialogue afterward on consequent visits.  If you get anything specific for either option.
---
The deathclaw egg collector at the fairground is still pissed at me..
---
Dang
---
That's the trick, have 2 people with magic shotguns focusing on the wendigos.
---
lol I love that
---
Lol yea committing a crime is always a good way to deal with low lvl
---
I think the reason was to create a penalty for dying.
---
Update. Ran it twice more. Got a 3*** cursed harpoon gun and last time I got a 3*** furious combat shotgun!
---
Probably should say what platform youre on
---
Maybe the rebalance patch that’s coming will fix this.
---
 I'm relatively new to the game, but I totally agree with you. In just  some hours in the game I've seen most of the players using the same  weapons, armor and acting the same way, one hitting everything giving  you no time to participate in any fight. The SBQ event was a hard one to participate, because they kill it so fast that shes already dead when the event alert pops. Whats the fun in it? The first time that I was able to attend the event was with a bunch of other newbies like me, we took around  25 minutes to kill her, it was hard but satisfying, not even the bad  loot took this sensation apart.
---
It is if you look at it as if that’s all they will ever do. And if that’s all they ever do, yeah, it is insane. But I’m banking on it just being the start of them trying to revamp the combat system to be more balanced and balance-able.
---
So what happens when you go to the elevator? Does the hand scanner not work?
---
You should be able to launch then, I bet the silo was just on cool down, you should have gotten a halo tape named -missile silo (something)- that let’s you see if any of the 3 silos have been used 
---
The codes update every Tuesday and that website is very quick to update 👍🏽
---
Damn.. I forgot
---
XB1
---
Hopefully, after the change to damage calculation, they’ll actually try to make this work. 
---
*I still can’t understand why unarmed out damages two handed.*
---
Wendigos have the screws, I want em :) Not to mention I can recoup a few bullets here and there. Don't need the ore. But it is a hell of a fun run!
---
I also have the VE1A.  It does good damage and keeps me alive.  If you are on a half decent team, you'll be happy using it and the event should go a little better. I'd suggest adding some luck and crits perks if you have room.
---
He might have blown to peices from someone's bloody mess perk, but there is a body
---
Not a bug, you just don't deal enough damage now, so at least for me, instigating is useless currently. Unless they plan on buffing the damage on weapons.
---
Well that’s irritating to say the least.
---
Holy crap, I just found out that my boyfriend tried to send me a link to this post until he realized it was me😂. He knows me so well.
---
You could move you camp then delete the pieces you don’t want and place your camp back down
---
Is he scorched? Why did you use ultracite? I haven’t fought him yet.
---
I don't believe there is a place with 2 junk nodes outside of a workshop. There is a possible camp site near Crater with junk and lead - but you have to place your circle **very** carefully (bring a friend).
---
Also, check these resources for node sites:
---

---
* [https://fo76map.com/](https://fo76map.com/)
---
I had half health and spontaneously died (probably server lag and I caught up) just as he did and spawned back outside the Mine and couldn't get to his body to loot it.
---
I haven’t seen anyone use cryo weapons on him so can’t confirm or deny. Melee is a bad option though unless you have a perma-stealth build.
---
I had a similar issue the other day trying to claim a few workshops. A lvl 400 player kept following me to different sites and killing me every time I activated a workbench. This game needs PvP and PvE servers. For the most part the community is great, but every once in a while you get a few dickheads in the mix.
---
It sucks that the people who complained were people who don't even regularly play NW.
---
The loot at the exit is overrated.  Stay in the mine, loot Earle and screws until the mine collapses.  You'll be teleported outside and still get the rewards.
---
today on PC i did this event and Earle glitched into the ceiling, i blew through 4000 rounds and we failed the event. but 200 screws was probably worth it
---
I died just as Earle did and was unable to get back into the mine to loot the bodies.
---
Fuck.
---
Colossus guarantees a 3\* legendary, as opposed to the 1\* rolling pins I get off the SBQ.
---
Also screws.
---
I’ve heard of that happening and would of preferred it rather than wasting time looking for a body then trying to escape only to die, if I would of known I wasn’t going to make it out I would of just stayed to loot the corpses and keep looking for a piece.
---
He is not. Op just doesn't know how to manage ammo consumption
---
Never give up, never surrender! You will make it for sure without even doing all the challenges. Especially with the potential double score events coming up
---
I will try that and let you know. Thanks
---
If you nuke the mine, do the event then nuke the Queen, it also restarts ACP.
---
If you die before he's about to die and respawn outside, do you just lose the loot on his body?
---
Can you wait outside and receive the event rewards?
---
I died once a little after he died while collecting screws, spawned outside, and just waited in the rads as it completed. Received the event awards and met up with everyone outside the mine.
---
Same here. I was running a instigating crossbow.  The extra stealth of that weapon was great (silent shots). Now it's a paperweight. Went from 910 damage on the first shot to 300 first shot, 60 - 125 after that.  Definitely need to go commando or just go heavy gunner. The respec requires a ton of levels to move stuff around. Not sure it's worth the grind.
---
I drum until the meter appears then run and gather greens and chunks. Then donate them all. I think RNG just likes messing with people.
---
I died once out of 4 rounds simply because I didn’t pay attention. The time I died was my first go at it.
---
I won’t. Die. Again. 😂
---
Yep. I died just as he did. I still had half health, but it must have been server lag catching up.
---
Well meeting the Grafton Mayor would be a good start to understanding what's going on there 
---
I feel like that particular quest is just a gag about how ignorant the Grafton Mayor is, a running theme with everything involving him
---
He's trying to appease lobbyers that don't exist anymore, he throws parades in his town to increase tourism, but these parades usually end up killing everyone cuz they involve monsters 
---
He tasks you with dumping pollution in the lake to cover one of his biggest donators' shady business practices, again this donator doesn't exist 
---
I'm actually not sure if there is any kind of resolution to his character, he's literally just an American politician gone absolutely out of control in a cartoonish way, I don't want to say much more til you actually do find him
---
You don't have to do his events if you don't want to, but basically he's there as a representation of how fucked up the leadership was, which led to the post apocalypse in the first place 
---
The things he tasks you would absolutely be downright evil in the pre war setting, but at least for the protestor quest, those "protesters" are no longer in control of their actions, and they're in horrible pain from the scorched plague as well as being controlled by the scorchbeast hive mind 
---
So imo that particular quest is a mercy killing, as well as set dressing to show how the mayor viewed his own people
---
One of the main goals of your character is stopping the scorched plague, so I feel like your character is more going along with what the mayor wants in order to get a control of the situation in Grafton, moreso than just being a bloodthirsty asshole killing protesters
---
You lose whatever he dropped 
---
I got event rewards but for all I know I could've gotten the fabled God roll DCG or Handmade
---
I don't remember receiving any reward for completing her quest, not even xp. Her idle dialogue is exactly the same as before I ever interacted with her. A friend of mine choose to tell her they found the locket but not her father, and the exact same thing happened (no rewards, same idle dialogue). I haven't actually spoken to her directly after completing her quest yet, but I'm assuming it's exactly the same.
---
No. Using your gun, camp item hp will always restore. Game won't count it even if you're shooting right when explosive bait goes off. It will only count the explosive bait. I know, cause I also thought of that and tried it. But never-the-less, explosive bait *WILL* destroy camp items.
---
Did it 2 times. No deaths and only like 5 ultracite plasmacores used in each fight.
---
They can be, but not everyone is. Mostly it's the ones near Fissure Sites that'll be Scorched. The ones for the new event are not
---
Where are they? I checked my mounted heads and they're not there.
---
Ah okay thought you meant if spawned outside you lose everything.
---
At least you got the mine mask. Both my attempts got me meat piles.
---
Ah. Ok. Thanks.
---
That penalty is excessive.
---
Thanks for the suggestion. I couldn’t delete them for some reason and my home was too big to blueprint. I just decided to move elsewhere :/ I guess a change of scenery isn’t so bad. Kinda want to build a uranium extractor home. Sounds kinda cool. Just don’t wanna be banned lol.
---
I found Yab's junkie guide super helpful for my junkie character so that's what I'd recommend for tips :)

---
Nope, Earl is a Sponge and a half regardless of the number of people. (Beat him twice, lost once... Only worth it if you wanna grab ALOT of screws from the adds, imo). Also have used alittle over 3k ammo per match, no solo's.
---
Thats why you aint getting.... you gotta pickup the trash/poop and put out the fires
---
Does anyone know where the mounted heads are located? 
---
Checked the mounted heads section in the build menu and it wasn't there.
---
Edit: it's in floor decor.
---
what's "magic guns"?
---
8 Treasury Notes vs 4 from SBQ, guaranteed 3* at the end, good chance at a 3* Cursed weapon (even if only for scrip), plus whatever Earle drops, tons of acid and screws from the Wendigos and they drop the ammo you’re shooting so it’s more ammo neutral than SBQ. I’ll take Earle any day of the week over the Queen. 
---
Only thing she does better is Power Armor mod plans and repair kits.
---
I just did that event 1st time and ya them suckers make me wanna switch to commando with my tse telsa. It was a blast except the reward 3* shovel
---
I looked around during a reload on my 50cal and there were over 30 for the spawn around me, emptied another ammo box just clearing them.
---
Appreciate the input. Ill wait for a group before I try it.
---
Good stuff, I’ve just 2 to get to 100%.
---
Not much of one for PvP, so still a few kills to go to unlock Good Grief.
---
Currently at Lvl 10 with an alt to get the Settlers achievement, should be done with Legendary Run after the next reset so will be able to concentrate on levelling and aiming for this...
---
Completed it solo. Nearly ran out of time. Running a full set of wood armor. Posted up in a corner to the left. Poped pyschotats, bobble head ballistic bock , and guns and bullets 3 . Some crit shots did 700+ damage . Full sneak half the time. I plan on beating my time. Gonna scoop some nuka orange and quantum for the next run . Oh. Used a blood 50 25 fix . It broke 3 times
---
Is this what u actually get? This isn’t what I’ve been getting
---
Never thought about using the cryolator that my melee character carries around.
---
I was too busy hacking legs.
---
I'll give it a try tonight.
---
Seen it happen once. Bloody Mess caused him to explode into surprisingly tiny chunks that clipped into the rocky ground and were unlootable. Ran around until the mine collapsed trying to find even a single toe or something sticking up enough to loot, but no dice.
---
Bethesda needs to make it so he doesn't get gibbed by Bloody Mess, like they did with the SBQ being turned into an ash/goo pile.
---
If you have the respawn glitch and force quit the game, you can rejoin a teammate in the mine if you restart fast enough
---
Easy, just keep an excavator suit on you to go digging for lead ore every few sessions + super duper perk + ammo smith perk. It’s changed the game and I can easily crank out 1k ammo and be set for a few days
---
It would be much more fun if it weren’t 3 other people and me
---
Noooo, sillly.. THATS you Fast Traveling to your desktop
---
LEEROY JENKINS!
---
Idk if they left it out intentionally or if its a bug. If its a bug its a HUGE oversight
---
So eventually this event is like fasnacht. Which I attended literally like sixty or Seventy Times and still didn't get a raven mask I guess I'll just keep collecting these stupid cow and chef outfits for the next few days
---
Oh yeah haha
---
yeah F that quest.  did it on an alt this week :(
---
I just did the event for the first time. My team completed it in like 3mins
---
Hear ye, hear ye!
---
No idea. I hear about huge file size differences a lot. I just noticed Rdr2 which is 113.7GB and it had no problem taking an update today, though I'm unsure what the size of it was. I just don't get how I have enough room to download another copy of Fo76 and it can't update.
---
We’ve been taking on average 10-15 min
---
I have a 1 star furious deathclaw gauntlet in my stash, but I've been using my 2 star furious + faster swing mole miner one cuz I think that puts it a bit ahead - though I definitely prefer the look of the deathclaw one.
---
Guess we just got lucky. Or some chad with a magic boss slapper was hiding in the shadows
---
Never gonna get charged since companies very rarely press charges unless the denial of service is directly at them. Flooding 1 or 2 routers won't cause them to pursue legal action. If there was open PvP I could just kill them till they leave, but sadly there's not.
---

---
I got a gauss rifle from the purveyor..could i get other gauss weapons from him or just the rifle?
---
Saying it too your teammate is pure jealously
---
&gt;  I’ve tried it atleast 8 times all unsuccessful people aren’t playing the objective they seem to just be farming screws from the spawns
---
It's so strange how different experiences can be.  My complaint is the opposite.  I've done it 5 or 6 times now.  I don't think Earl was alive more than 3 minutes in any of the fights.  
---
I had high hopes for the one too - people burned a whole bunch of lunchboxes (so we were going in with 100% xp buff).  Thought - maybe we'd be farming.  But - nope.  Earl died ASAP.
---
I run an instgating crossbow. Reload takes forever, so it's pretty much hot garbage with the nerf. Instigating and stealth builds are a joke now. Went from 910 first shot to 300 (500 if headshot). So 1 shot to 5 and stealth is blown for sure on the third shot. BGS needs to provide a respec option for those who wasted time building a character that's now worthless.
---
Honestly I was was surprised at how slow his health goes down the first time. Stealth commando did higher numbers than fighting SBQ, but didn't seem to reflect it in his actual HP bar.
---
Bots are probably more of a threat than the average bush wookie. But the best solution to this is to reduce the radius of the map, and start it off with fewer players. Maybe go 24 players, 6 squads.  
---
  
---
The worst part about all of this is that they actually already did this. Then all the afk and hiders complained the map was too small and too much action to generate passive xp, so it was reverted!
---
I’ve tried BE B10 and AA10 heavies and I’m averaging 20 dps. Might have to use commando
---
Isn't Bethesda just amazing developers. 😀 They totally play their own game.
---
They are trying to nerf the people that one shot everything but the rest of us are getting caught in the mix.
---
It's tempting. I'll put something together and see if its post worthy once it's done. No promises though, my creativity is usually limited to spurts.
---
How the eff do I escape the mine after the colossal problem? I had to fast-travel out wity like 5 seconds left and I didn't get the loot. :(
---
After doing the event 2 times im now glad i have over 3k stimpacks on my mules that i been stocking since Beta 😅
---
PS4?
---
Don't forget the flux....you get two of those.
---
The weapon drops are nice but the treasury notes...why... more treasury notes less flux. I don’t have to do a single event and I have enough notes for a month
---
and damage nerfs inc
---
I was hitting for about 45 using a BE flamer
---
Does this read like a Trump quote to anyone else?
---
Yeah, it feels like if you don't have absolutely broken weapons this event is gonna eat ammo and ultimately be a waste of time.
---
19-24 with a be Gatling plasma
---
Reminds me of CarlSagan42
---
I ran it twice with 5 other players all lvl 100+ (myself including) and it wasn’t as bad as you’re describing.
---
You really like negative karma eh?
---
Keep making these threads about NW and keep up-voting.  They will eventually hear us.  
---
Here is my suggestion:  
---
During the 3 minute voting period, make it a death match and every kill actually awards the small xp you get normally in NW. Many other BR games have this warmup session before the match.  
---
Smaller map radius during lower traffic hours. Start the match with 20-24 players. I wouldn't even mind if it were 12-16 players if the algorithm can make it under 1 min wait time always.  
---
Bring on solo or duos mode and get rid of teams of 4.
---
Ghouls by default I believe.
---
I had no problem during ACP.  Only died because I was in vats and couldn't stim myself.
---
This video, I’ve watched everything. It’s just bad. No proper builds, compares stuff with random perks. Not even a single sneak attack which is where most bloodied people go.
---
It fucking better be. I just got a bloodied Gauss shotgun
---
My last respawn time was 48 seconds. F that.
---
It’s funny people actually think karma matters.
---
They’re only proving my point, much more glaring issues in this game but no, they’d rather cry and throw fits over one less building trick.
---
You use VATS? Actually aim like a real man 😂
---
Demo is for any explosive weapon. Grenadier is for thrown explosives. 
---
Full health heavy is be looking for junkies personally. Anti armour doesn’t stack with stabilized.
---
Xbone
---
I swapped last night for my second colossal problem run, and feel stupid for being 115 and never using commando :( my lever action rifle will now gather dust on my wall as a memory
---
Damn, unlucky, I got the Plushie, Meat Pile and now the mask
---
Well they litteratly are nerfing everything.. events are hard enough as it is... Energy weapons are garbage..
---
Explosive heavys are garbage.. shotguns are usually garbage pistols and revolvers are also garbage.. they are backpedaling.. not moving forward.
---
I’m 30 and wouldn’t even consider it yet personally.  That’s still something to aspire towards.  Of course I haven’t tried to fight the queen yet either.  Figure I’ll poke my head around there around 40 or so.  The queen that is.  No idea why I’d consider the new dude.
---
That can be a point, but I doubt. Bloodied just has the most scaling overall. I only see bloodied going down with a low life nerf across the board.
---
*Yes*
---
People who don't play the game much bitching
---
The whole point of this post is to let you know that it may not have any effect
---
Plasma is green, ultracite is yellow. You being color blind doesn't make me a snowflake. If anything, your line "You seem new, so let me elaborate" makes you a snowflake.
---
Yep, pretty much the same experience for me on the PS4.  Maybe worse.   
---
Base PS4 performance : [https://youtu.be/eAzBIHO7UNM](https://youtu.be/eAzBIHO7UNM)
---
Really hope they can find a way to optimize this for consoles because I'd like to give this event a real shot but it's just impossible with this kind of performance.
---
Hmmm, I’m 400 something and did it solo and didn’t die, but to be honest I did spam them stimpacks. I was rocking my excavator armor with minigun/gauss minigun and nuka grenades. Reloading was a pain and it was difficult to manage the acid attacks and the wendigo spawn, luckily these weapons are fast reloading. I couldn’t imagine trying it with anything other than a heavy weapon and power armor.
---
I’m glad you had an easier time with it than me. I’ll definitely be trying it again next time it pops up.
---
Two ticks at Dolly Sods, Two at the Hunter's Shack, 6+ at the location southwest of harpers ferry where a river and train track cross the road.  Near that road will be a quonset hut with a chain link fence around it.
---

---
Edit: forgot about Gillman Lumber Mill.  4+ ticks there.
---
It’s a separate item in floor decor
---
have you even BEEN to a fissure, bro?? despite the dope name, these mega radbats are not my idea of a good time
---
The only thing that 1st gives you is the scrap box.  You can’t store regular junk (like if you wanted to store specific stuff to display or if you needed it for crafting/quests), you can’t put plans in it, you can’t put ammo, weapons, armor. 
---
You can easily survive without the scrap box, people did for until 1st was even released. You go harvest junk when your ready to build your camp, and then you occasionally save whatever you need for repairs (or don’t and just use the mounds of repair kits from the queen or the SCORE to repair gear for a while)
---
Once you put the scrap aside, you have everything else and there’s no monetization to increase your space for that stuff.  Practically, the scrap box is probably only letting you store a couple of heavier weapons.
---
Just played my stealth rifleman. 2 headshots or a crit headshot with a two shot lever is the best I can manage. . Body shots take 3 - 5 and every enemy will beeline to your location as stealth is long gone after the 2nd shot. Instigating is utter garbage now.
---
We need a little Hula Dancer radio that plays this. Imagine setting it up along side the cooler box and the incoming hammock.
---
Wait you guys are getting rewards?
---
I attempted once today. I think we had around 10 people and we couldn’t even do it. Around 10% health when we failed unfortunately. Definitely a great boss fight though.
---
Why would the queen land if you are in the sky?
---
Also she won't land if she is staggering. So lay off full auto.
---
I used a hunters lmg for most of it but swapped to a cryolater at the end.it was a legacy. But my handmade was doing ok as well there for a min
---
With a Railway? Yea...no thanks.
---
Ultracite is Yellow?
---
Pretty sure it's lime Green though, you might need to get your eyes checked man, saying this out of concern at this point..
---
Snowflake.
---
Does anyone know if there is a damage theshold you have to meet to loot the CW.
---
30k HP
---
you have to imagine these troglodytes just hit kids in the face
---
Big guns bobbles, hi voltage hefe, psychotats, full adrenaline proc?
---
Put your camp in the Forest where low levels are, so they visit your camp.  
---
Make a point to be present in your camp for a period of your gameplay.  
---
Keep your "free" care package behind a 3* lock in a shed. 
---
Use the "summon" emoji to get them to the free-ish gear.
---
Make sure the vendor is empty before they leave.
---
Kill them and eat them.
---
Leave the door open so they can get their junk.
---
Love, your friendly neighborhood cannibal.
---
Full adrenaline and psycho stats made it about 28 dps - short on the big gun and hefe lol
---
I bet they would fix it if it auto conpleted and it gave you the score.
---
Are you looking to trade that mask? If you have any other stuff from the event I would also be looking for them. Dm me if you’re interested
---
Figured the scattered explosive would be good for spray and pray against the wendigo spawns
---
But do you loot him?
---
Poor Julie wants a Nuka Cola. Let me bring her a Nuka Cola.
---
Complaining works! It just dropped after like 25 times. Current inventory:
---
Plans: 
---
Meat Cleaver (3)
---
Meat Tenderizer (1)
---
Backpack (5)
---
Brahmin Grill
---
Apparel:
---
Bloody Chef Hat (2)
---
Bloody Chef Outfit (4)
---
Chally Mask (2)
---
Chally Outfit (6)
---
Grillmaster's Hat (4)
---
*Correction: After over 30 times, since I also got a Tenderizer I scrapped and the first instances of those plans which disappeared when first learned. I guess the grill is the only really rare reward in my timeline.
---
Sad truly. I hope BOS expansion brings in good rifleman weapons.
---
Get a handmade. Handmades are better than Railway rifles ;)
---
Yeah, he has a legendary weapon, 200ish caps and some other stuff
---
Okay.
---
What platform?
---
How do they work?
---
What you play on?
---
I'm only level 70, but my losing group had a lvl 300+, and a couple of 100+, plus a couple lowbies and me.... ammo sink man... omg
---
How many meat cleavers would it take to throw, is the question
---
I played it on a few of my characters both heavy weapon builds. My TSE .50 felt like it was just pissing him off more than melting him...I think Final Word was actually doing better than my TSE .50. My FFR Gauss Mini was melting him, but it hurts every time I fire that thing for more than 5 seconds. Tried a TS galltling lazer and minigun they did alright. Feels like compared to bloodied builds I do zero damage.
---
Wtf is that helmet theeeeee?!
---
I run Vampires for my PA HW build, lets me tank the queen or other strong enemies without using stimpacks.  As for the 90% reduced weight it only effects the weapons base weight, not the weight of the mods.  Yes explosive weapons degrade faster than non explosive ones.
---
The bigger problem is the fact it’s locked at 8 player
---
Because it was an insult to people. They focused on something people actually liked rather than fixing game breaking issues.
---
I made the mistake of hopping out of power armour since I couldn’t see any Radiation so I could use my unyielding to the max
---
Booooooy was that a mistake
---
PS4. Was going to try restarting, but didn’t know if anyone else had this?
---
I am all for any new PVP modes which present a challenge to everyone and takes skill.  
---
The BR would be the best except they have put very little work on it.
---
Usually 2-4 at dolly sods too, good list!
---
It’s showing for me?
---
Dangit I missed?
---
PS4
---
Most ultracire ammo is more efficient than regular ammo and has a base damage increase but it does do extra damage for scorch
---
Dang it's a lot to just get the unyielding secret service tho lol. When the legendary perks launch im prolly gonna do the poison resist
---
agreed, They Have Multiplayer so more pvp would make sense bc everyone loves pvp
---
They should make a patch that makes event icons/location markers a priority, so it’s always on top of player markers
---
Me too meng. 
---
Add me up if u ever wanna do some runs.
---
Psn: alphaboomer
---
I have (what I call) a one shot combat shotty. When vats is used (and as long as it’s not a legendary or anything over lvl 65) it is pretty much a one shot one kill (without the shotgun perk cards equipped). I use that on the wendigo spawns then switch over to my anti armor plasma to work on him. I stay away from the drills as that will kill you faster than the spawns and revive anyone who gets down that I can. The only low lvl we had was a 112 then me at 170  and everyone else between 300-400. It was the first two times ever done it and o just followed everyone one else’s lead. I did have my nuka cola power armor with bright af red light with helped pin point the colossus a bit.
---
They're really just nerf weapons that have potential of 1 shotting everything besides queen and other bosses. 
---
I remember testing an unstoppable monster with no other food buffs and 2 hit the freerange sheepsquach before it turned legendary everyone was pissed.
---
Basically with any of these types of events if we’re struggling BAD from the rip I’ll just head out. Not worth the time or resource investment for fights that at best will be down to the wire
---
Do you have the communist collectron? I get tons of blood packs from that thing so much so that I’m just throwing stims out to any lowbies I come across
---
You seem like a good friend to have. While unfortunately I can't help you directly in regards to your request, I think we might be able to help each other out.  As a cannibal mutant, I collect way more stimpaks than I use. Let me know if you play on Ps4, I would happily trade my surplus to you for a partnership of sorts.
---
If not, happy hunting and good luck!
---
Always glad to help my fellow chem dealers!
---
540 damage says other wise.
---
The damage nerf is hardcore though.. They should buff energy weapons and all the wepons that are complete trash..
---
Adding now. We have about 6 people that do runs now so silo prepping isn’t miserable
---
Cryolator user. There's a possibility that it slows down the frequency that Earle does his fear scream, but having only done the event twice I don't have much in the way of facts. It just felt the second time through  there was less fear dashes on my character.
---
I’m betting vault 63 holds some answers. Of vault 94 created the strangler vines, I’m sure 63 and 96 did something else equally as bad (and don’t even bring up 51...).
---
Ah yes, I love having to bum rush out of the mine while being mauled by 50 little assholes, and leaving behind about 500 screws and other loot than I can't pick up in 2 minutes. The pinnacle of a good time. Right after I do that I shove bamboo in my dick and jump stomach first into concrete.
---
Also everything I'm reading says that this is supposedly a bug in it should come with outfits.
---
Well one Appalachia is supposed to make this not matter right
---
Better now than never, no? It may sound bad after 2 years, and it is, but sometimes you have to set better foundations for the continuity of the game. There’s never really a correct time to address fuckups on that level.
---
If Bethesda actually made their game properly, I would agree with you. But VATS is too broken for me, unfortunately. I miss entire 30 round magazines at 95% hit chance regularly.
---
Just a question. Why did you just not leave the session?
---
I had a good system in place before 1st. With 1st I don't feel I have much if an advantage. Primarily hold more legendaries aka scrip bank.
---
A agree but the instant death of enemies in groups wouldn't be fixed tho.
---
Give it time before you try get it, the prices will slump in a week
---
It sounds like it’s shaping up to be Vault 94 two point oh. 
---
I haven’t tried it yet but so far the comments are very mixed.
---
Handmade and Tesla no comp for me and I don’t use the fixer because I’m emo that way
---
Got the plushie on my first run, unfortunately, I revieved a one * dagger.
---
Well DPS and Damager Per Shot are very different things.
---
Commando is only really optimal for bullet sponges, but Rifleman is best for literally anything that isnt a boss fight or a mirelurk queen in the wild
---
Nice. Lkn forward to doing more runs and seeing how it pans out overall. There werent many melees in my group, but i was concerned that there would be other melees who give low health peeps a bad name
---
Yes. I know how ammo works. You're just complaining about ammo in turn for a bad reward, if you don't want to waste your flux, get a different weapon without prime, or unprime your weapon
---
There’s literally no point right? You don’t even get xp I don’t think
---
You kill me???? You cheat!!! I no this cuz I has cheat and your cheat can't be better than me cheat!!!!! You cheat!
---
Ultracite is slightly more damaging to pretty much everything and crafts more ammo for the mats, certain weapons almost demand it, looks at lmg.
---
I'm still willing to pay this for it
---
I had a level 4, and a level 38. The level 200 people just left halfway through, to my annoyance.
---
Colossal Problem was delayed, then released buggy and pretty much unplayable to most players... But hey, let’s fix this camp trick which has zero repercussions on gameplay. 
---
It’s not like not being able to make double sided walls made the game unplayable. There are more actual game breaking glitches that were way more important. I don’t care if you people got insulted... Utterly ridiculous. Not even going to entertain this conversation.
---
Numbers get too high in games, they’re nerfing them because they realize it’s not sustainable. AAA MMO devs have done the same thing, in the case of WoW they’ve done it two different times I know of (likely 3 because I haven’t played the last 2-3 expansions). They’ve also done this in FFXIV. 
---
No game with numbers, multiplicative damage modifiers and increasing numbers are immune, even from AAA developers that are the best in their industry, so really it’s pointless to point fingers at Bethesda like they’ve done something wrong when so many other games have had the exact same issues.
---
Been happening to me fairly frequently since Meat Week started, I've been assuming it's because of server load.
---
Protip: Go to Sunnytop Station and check all the suitcases there. I got my plushie plan from there and not from the event itself.
---
Same thing happens a lot at Watoga Station. Kudos to the kind souls who leave loot in those suitcases.
---
It was 2fps for me
---
Sweet!! I’m doung one more then i’ll be off for the night but on tomorrow
---
I don't feel like it effects him, but it seems like maybe ads are more numerous with more people, but that is purely anecdotal based on fewer than 30 events.
---
Just added you - FaTaL1ty 45
---
I also found a max level B1090 50 cal in a vendor for 2k caps. Gotta love it
---
I didn’t realize the colossal event was there, I thought it was in the wendigo cave for some dumbass reason. My camp was below the raider train station beside the event mine. So bye bye camp lol I wasn’t logging off, wanted to play the event. So I moved my camp a little further south in the savage divide. Was so torn, do I log off due to impending nuke, or join the event? It was a good run, camp..
---
Just spent 5k bullets only to not get anything at the end
---
 Heres whatsup with the bloodied build.. If the enemies dont see you . you can 1tap running stealth. Sometimes ive had to fire 4 or 5 shots at them to kill them.  It only works if you are hidden or in caution. When danger pops up when you are crouched  stealth doesnt matter then. You can die really quick to. Thats 1. Scenario 2.. i go back to heavy weapons 
---
Farming lead . captain noob angry turtle are making good points.. especially captain noob.
---
On my first attempt, Earle just...glitches into the ceiling, never to be seen again. Lovely. All those stims and ammo gone for nada.
---
I had literally zero issues with it in my run. Everyone who died was able to respawn and rejoin the fight, I only used about 10 stimpaks, maybe 500-600 rounds of ammo, and I found my way out of the mine with no trouble. Guess your mileage may vary
---
Put your Nuke Key Card in right after you start the launch prep. Then you’re the only one who can launch.
---
I agree to a point, but I don't mind a nerf.  My problem with it is that this nerf is too big. I understand that making buffs additive is necessary going forward, but they should now leave it additive and buff some of the perks to give back about half of what they took away.  IMO they have the right idea but just went too far and are all but nullifying weapon damage perks.  I don't think many people want that.
---
i also enjoyed it and did not get glitched respawns!
---
Could be modded
---
Your argument here is literally arguing in favor of the people who complained about it in the first place. Thank you!
---
Is an under equipped lvl 27 who plays alone ready for this
---
If you're a bloodied build with op weapons you're gonna brrrt this bitch like an A10 Warthog, but if you're not....enjoy spending 3k ammo to fail....or if you're lucky pass by the skin of a deathclaws balls.
---
Bad server
---
Probably not, mate, and really all I'm after is that rug
---
Now im curious if a came across your camp was at one that had a bunch on the roof. I was like this is bold lol.
---
Right idea perhaps.. they better rethink the decision.. Many people are not to pleased. some are making fun of the angry players. ok they can have a laugh.. not our fault they cant get a grasp.
---
Do you any percentages on drop rates or a source for drop rate information?
---
Fair enough I see you point
---
Dodgy combo with action boy, sneak*** with escape artist, serendipity, and ricochet are your friends.
---
Oof couldve got that dagger afking in meat week.. .
---
Then you gotta zoom out and back in again when the bug happens, worse if you're East of WS
---
I went in with no preparation and didnt even change my perk load out and smoked him with a group of 4 other players . They were all around lvl 200ish I'm lvl 350ish . Only died twice and smoked alot of then with only 7 ultracite plasma cores in a ultracite PA . Used antiarmor gatling plasma .
---
Well, Olivia did kill all of them when they found her out, and then, as you know, she and her mother died. I think the Order of Mysteries was wiped out before the Scorched even became a major issue!
---
I’ve had this happen. The event is always still going on for me, but I don’t get the notification. 
---
My solution: fast travel to vault 76 a couple minutes before the top of the hour and sprint to the meat cook location. If no notification pops up, check your “events” tab under “data” to check if it’s going on. Once the timer runs out to start the event, do the event as normal. Once you start collecting things, the notification will pop that you have started the event.
---
Hope this helps.
---
I let commander dag rock the mistress gear at my camp sometimes, when she isnt wearing the chally moo moo set. But she always has on the pendant either way
---
Jeez
---
It was a one note joke that stretched on WAY too long
---
I run bloodied but run 50%health .might Junp to junkies soon
---
My trap camp is legacy
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Are you a bloodied build? I have a theory that when you have more rads or low health, it gives you that bug. My boyfriend has that problem a lot. And I do on my one character who has high rads. Just wondering if you’re also in that boat.
---
PS: those perks are pretty easy to proc with power armor.
---
Also, the armor set's associated headgear counts towards the perk.
---
The one that was supposed to come this year but has been pushed beyond the horizon?
---
My husband and I just experienced a similar problem on Xbox on our first try. He just went into the ceiling and that was it. Same situation, too. Mutated, down to about half health, and nothing. If you’re gonna delay release, at least make the delay worthwhile. I’d have rather waited a bit longer and still have my ammo and stims and have a hope of completion at least. I love the game, but this is ridiculous.
---
This just happened to me too. Are you on Xbox? I was in with a great team, lot of high levels and tons of heavy hitter weapons. Get down to the last star (I think) and he just... disappears into the ceiling. People were shooting at the ceiling in frustration.
---
It sucked. I'm a stealth sniper so I was focused on the wendigos and stimpacking people. It was a lot of fun.
---
I fought and defeated 12 Earls today, he's not that tough...his wendigo spawn can get annoying because of staggering but that's about the only difficult thing about the event really.
---
You've gotten ridiculously lucky then. My experience and about the 40 or so people in my discord have had very different outcomes than yours. I've had him glitch in the floor and ceiling about 5 different times already. Not to mention 8 person instancing is ass, and people can't join in late. Just a poorly designed event by devs completely out of touch with their game.
---
The plushie:( I want the plushie
---
Yea Tesla is my favorite weapon I’m not gonna stop using it but I will stop doing the event
---
Honestly, I hated it but I couldn't stop laughing half the time more so when the Ghouls came in, legit felt like you was fighting to get to the front
---
So, I'm 50/50 really lol
---
And then he mutates half way  so its more like 45k
---
There are as many instances as there needs to be. I went to join my bf and we were both confused because my screen looked completely different than his (he was already in the arena) whereas I was with a different person and it was only the 2 of us waiting for the event to start.
---
LVL 60, have done it three times without dying. Marsupial and kiting them around the room opposite to the big guy
---
I am not doing phrasing well today.
---
It's very simple to me - Bethesda probably only realised either after the introduction of the SS/ISS or Colossal that they couldn't ignore the balance change issues any further as future boss level enemies would be undermined as soon as it launched or create such a gap between the top damage dealers and the average player where the former would still melt them in seconds while the latter would find it nigh on impossible to take it down.
---
We are VERY long overdue for a combat balance pass. In some ways, I'm actually surprised it's happening as "soon" as it is.
---
I really do hope Bethesda does further combat balance and doesn't just rest it's laurels here for the next couple of years. Not just nerfs but also buffs where necessary too.
---
Wait what? We can use butchers bounty for stimpacks?
---
It's the same. You aren't seeing the strength scaling.
---
Just do what Destiny does. That’s my answer to most issues with this game
---
20+ times. F*cking 20 times and nothing. I’ve moved, switched guns, fire shots, moved again, and I’m still stuck in a god damn silo. This fast travel bug has gotten worse and worse: it’s SO annoying. Literally makes me want to quit playing when it happens this much but I just went through all the work of launching a nuke. SBQ is gonna be dead by the time I can even fast travel out of here. So lame.
---
It was my first drop as well (sorry if I sound like a dick lol)
---
Keep on doing it, despite the lag, the fact that I get melted even while having 600+ DR it's a fun event
---
I'm legit more worried about getting the Tenderiser and what not from Meat week
---
Thanks for trying to help. Ya I was going there and nothing every happened. Hoping resetting the game will fix it!
---
It was kinda crazy we started the event with 4 people, 2 were between 70 and 80 and I'm 181. Two guys quit pretty early but this 74 dude and I were able to finish it up with 10 seconds left. The only issues I was having was playing in first person and not realizing I was standing in stupid. That did more damage than anything I think. Middle part of the fight I was alone because I think the 74 guy was about to quit but saw that i was trying to finish it up by myself.
---
You're gonna brrrt this bitch no problem then.
---
I should be able to do a search for what I want and by parameters I want and it runs through the whole server.
---
Still advertising wallpapers you can't place over window walls too 😞
---
Lvl 770 myself &amp; yes I was carrying everyone who joined because I refuse to lose...i stopped stimpaking the lower levels because they hurt more than they helped 90% of the time.
---
I can't because even if I see it within the first minute, A. The server is full and wont empty until it's over, or B. The person is displaying offline completely defeating the purpose of the LFG. Barely use it because of this.
---
I have that but idk if  I can give it to u it not
---
The first time I did this event there were 8 people and I had to leave after realizing it wasn't going to happen. The next time it was just me and a random level 300, the two of us wound up killing the boss pretty easily. Just come prepared and it's not that bad. We stayed under the entrance where you fall down so every time we were feared we would run into the wall and the spawns usually left us alone. Wasn't that bad.
---
Only seen some angry turtle stuff on it im a junkies/bloodied commando I destroy with my 2 handmades. Like i have to intentionally switch to tesla so ppl can get hits and thats not a good thing cause alot of ppl won't hence why you have tons of post about not getting hits on legendaries or events should let you get the legendary off enemies.
---
 I dont fully agree with a nerf I'd rather enemies be stronger but to many op weapons out there explosive gatling plasma etc.
---
It's the plan I'm mainly after
---
We're in desperate need of combat balance. Being able to melt what are meant to be some of the toughest opponents in seconds is not a good thing for the overall health of the game.
---
Legacy weapons will reign king again just sayin if this goes through.
---
You'd honestly be surprised
---
I have extra. Like three or four I think.  Plus the plane for peppered or whatever it’s called
---
Technically with a forth effect
---
Sneak bonus with bobbles for my fixer i was hitting roughly 88-111 depending on my hp
---
You can't kill me, I'm a food build!
---
I can't trigger the quest at all. The lady keeps only saying, "Sorry. We're all booked up." Hubert won't talk to me at all and I can't pick the door cause my skill is too low. HOW do I trigger this?
---
I usually die once when I go.  I think it is a pretty fair fight.  I don't do power armor since  I'm a junkie melee build with death claw.  I'll use a junkie gun on Earl but swap to my claw for one hit kills on the windigos when they become too much.  Part of being a team player is keeping those down.  I still do plenty of damage to Earl himself.
---
The actual plan?? Damn, you're lucky lol I'll happily buy them off you, say 500 caps? I'll buy 3 if you have them
---
From what I know, there's not a limit. There's a bucket limit of 8, but if an extra person joins they're now put into a new bucket alone until another joins
---
Problem with this event is the crap balance. Its balanced for everyone being blooded build. F this event when the damage nerf hits.
---
I experienced the same thing. Ton of ammo spent and beat it with 4 minutes or so left... was super tough to manage all the spawns.
---
Imma Raider sooo
---
I’d like this to be applied to the queen fight too
---
I'll swap the receiver on my combat rifle to .38 to build up .45 ammo from time to time. Helps when .38 is 0 caps or given away freely
---
I was able to go to the event. But when the event ended some level 40 in a chally outfit kept knifing me, while i was playing the drum. So i got fed up and hit him with my deathclaw gauntlet. Turns out his teammates were much higher level. There were 6 players t-bagging my dead body.
---
Maybe they already made Them and camouflage the holes with toothpaste
---
Thought u couldnt insert till AFTER the prep is done
---
Prime it! You get more ammo.
---
Like 4 lvl 5s we’re harassing me idk why lol so I killed them all with my Tesla was so enjoyable.
---
What system are u on
---
You won't get banned for this.
---
Single shot and burst fire. Trigger discipline will save you tons.
---
No.  And that's what he is asking for
---
:(
---
You're welcome
---
I'm guessing xbox?
---
This is true
---
Easy. Bloodied Explosive .50. Does over 300 damage and I haven’t even maxed out heavy gunner/demo expert. Absolutely wrecks anything that isn’t an SBQ or colossus. Not to mention you can fire whenever you want and don’t have to wait for the weapon to spin up unlike some other heavies.
---
Kinda seems so. I've noticed a few textures are rather different now on a few things and more shiny, So.
---
First time I did the event today it was only me and my level 39 brother who only had a executioners handmade at level 35. We beat him with 10 minutes to spare, which was really unexpected between just the two of us. Earl wasn’t nearly as hard as the Queen. 
---
(If anything my brother got his attention and I did all the damage with my B3325 handmade.)
---
I prefer healing salves....easier to make and u can make 150+ per run, without super duper....I like them as there is no animation and u can stack
---
You should get the loot automatically lol what’s up with these convoluting solutions to simple problems just like the ammo converter
---
and THIS is why I love reddit. 
---
I was going to do it alone. Level 117 just me and a minigun LOL ...
---
I am suddenly reminded of the guy who would give brand new players Nukashine and laugh thinking about them waking up somewhere deep in the Cranberry Bog, With a level 3 pipe pistol
---
THANK YOU!!!
---
Same VA as the overseer I think
---
I'm not sure if it's the case with controllers, but I've noticed that framerate directly affects mouse sensitivity in all Creation Engine games, 76 included. It makes low framerates feel even more sluggish than they would in any other game, and I wouldn't be surprised if it does indeed affect controllers in the same way. One of many reasons why I loathe this ancient engine.
---
I ended up basically soloing it cause only one guy showed up, lvl 71, broke his Gatling Plasma within a min and spent the rest of the event running around with a pole hook.
---
No, no enemies scale based on number of players.
---
Oh yeah but the boodied versions right now is a wall of death. Im looking at it from prospective of not having those op weapons why handmades are op also if i can kill a sheepsquach in one clip thats to much damage imo i do think they need to be some of the best tho 70% more damage etc aa should be like 40% junkies is ok but i think they did a stacking change not % change so idk.
---
 innosurvivalist did a vid and it didn't look to bad
---
Can you give me 30 for the excavator armor? I need it for a mission :,v
---
First word that came out his mouth I’m like “Jet?”
---
Never thought of that, you got a specific run you do?
---
If I am not mistaken, SBQ used to, or still does scale to number of players present at the event.
---
Thought the were encrypted
---
Ty for the tip.  Will do next time
---
This event had legit the worse FPS I’ve ever seen in a game. I just stood there until I afkd. Not ever going back. Hopefully the market on screws drops though
---
No that was a big fat hoax.
---
With what’s in the PTS, we can hope soon.
---
First off...no one can place anything at ur house unless u are both on private teams...if so, one of ur friends is an asshole
---
There isn't a Bloodied nerf. It was a universal nerf. At the end of the day, the most powerful build by far is still Bloodied. And Bethesda has indicated that they do not intend to leave the damage numbers in their "nerfed" state.
---
I don’t worry about it. His entire story is just unbelievable. There’s been several times where I’ve had people follow me and spam hit me. If he can’t evade them for literally 2 seconds of quickly opening the map and fast traveling to a random place, then he’s the issue
---
I think this was so much fun after the grind it’s been lately. My group of friends and I went in together and we had an absolute blast!
---
That isn’t exactly hard to get lmao
---
I honestly do not know why people are bothering. Just give me your ammo.
---
I mean I have pc Xbox and ps4 but I don’t play 76 on ps4.  Just pc and Xbox
---
Sorry mate
---
And ppl wonder why we shit on this game.
---
I'm melee too...I haven't failed yet.  Ran it about 9 times now.  It's worth the effort.  Also, a melee build would be a credit to the team for the windigos.  We can one shot them and still do damage to Earl.
---
This fight should drop like 5 legendaries all 3 star
---
Ohh, ok well rip
---
Its good nps
---
Neither is firing hundreds of rounds 😅
---
Yes there are people who use hacked controllers. Easiest way to tell is if the gun they are using seems like its shooting faster than yours, if you're using the same gun. 
---
You can test it out for yourself by tapping the fire trigger instead of holding. Most of the autos are broken this way. The fire rate is increased when you tap fire and that's what basically what a hacked controller does
---
Great game design
---
Level 19 when I did it  have to agree with ya. I didnt have a lot of guns but I had melee weapons for the standard wendigos, and I still pulled through with 4 deaths after my high levrl teammates helped me
---
It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear...and it absolutely will not stop. Ever. Until you are dead!
---
Turn on passive mode and you’ll be fine !
---
Lmao what build do you run? Iirc the dudes health is static right and it’s the same no matter how many people are there? Must be a heavy bloody
---
Are you running in too fast and getting mobbed by enemies? Are you bringing enough stimpaks? Where are you dying? Who is killing you? Are you killing them before they kill you?
---
Oh, I didn’t know that, rip tho...
---
They advertised features that were only in the conceptual stages. None of that is coming for a long time
---
I actually am a bloodied build too. Now that you mention that, I don't ever remember having the problem before I switched to a bloodied build.
---
There’s already basically no penalty to being a low health build. This is the risk you take being low health, the benefits you get in return are not insubstantial.
---
Alright Fam, I just got past this after a week not being able to reinsert the sample and seeing the error. what I did was team up with a friend who was conveniently behind on the quest and had yet to do this one. We made sure he was the leader and ran the quest. I made sure he inserted the sample first, read everything on the terminal except the analyzation prompt AND THEN THE FREAKING CIRCUIT. He was then able to run the program and get inoculated. Once he got confirmation he completed the quest I inserted my fuse. Ran the analyzation. AND SWEET JESUS IT FINALLY WORKED.
---
Fallout 76 is an MMO at it's core. They are designed to be time sinks with very little reward.    
---
Every gamer's skill is different and people have had plenty of time to get really good at it. As a slighlty disabled gamer I won't be as good as most players.    
---
They'll probably do it again after another year or two given 76 lasts that long.
---
if we are in a team or some folks are near you you cant use bloodied in a group to its full effect. you dont run bloodied so you dont understand..😉
---
It's definitely a grind. 3 character. Dropped one. It's too much, especially the transfer of items that could take hrs between alt.
---
And it's kinda of a let down not been able to trade between alt. S.S. plans and or armours.
---
I was running my Junkies 25ffr Gatling Plasma. It took about 5 partially full cores plus 10 full ones.
---
Even with stims I got up to get this.. A FORTY EIGHT SECOND RESPAWN COUNTER. I was pisssssed.
---
I envy bloody builds for their sheer boss killing ability, but I love smash ya’ll in PvP lmao cheers man good job
---
There’s already basically no penalty for being a low health build. This is the price you pay for your not insubstantial benefits.
---
If players are taking agro in the group that you are in you dont get a true critical. The crits are not in full swing with a group only by yourself most of the time.
---
I mean, everyone and their grandma calls them that, but still.  The actual secret service is called the USSS,  you can just call it that.
---
Any explosive fast-firing weapon like the Minigun is really good even if it wasn’t magic
---
Its either youre low health build or youre not killing it
---
That's funny...u need better/bigger teammates
---
I hope so.
---
The newer ones? Really? Fuck I hope not
---
I built mine near the event because I like the location, but also I usually sell ammo at a cap a piece and super stims from 10-20 caps each.
---
Expensive food, Florida man?
---
Then everyone will complain about not being able to fast travel to their friend for free because "some stupid event is covering it"
---
That’s a different matter entirely.
---
Also not true, mind you. Slower, certainly.
---
He is walking on top of the mine ceiling..... Good luck
---
I brought all my ammo and stuff, did well right up until the countdown started then backed into rockfall while firing at some leftover wendigos, dead. Game teleported me outside the event zone, I saw the warning pop up " Are you sure you want to leave the event?' slapped kb: Noooooooo......... dammit. Missed rewards and must have burned a dozen cores. :/
---
I run bloodied most of the time just use a junkies explosive handmade because of the aoe of explosive. It by itself is a group pisser offer and by group i mean events not team.
---
Not just this event then, that's a game wide thing, my solution is don't die.  Vampire heavy weapon is great.
---
That's handy, good to know
---
I don't think so.
---
Wha-... you know what, I just should’ve assumed something like this would’ve happened
---
I get the feeling they didn't think of this and left it up to one wasteland to fix. With one wasteland every enemy will be leveled to meet the toons level supposedly so a level 25 would see a similar level boss and cannon fodder. Bethesda in their infinite laziness then pushed this event before one wasteland cause fuck it and left that patch to fix it.
---
I'm well aware. But teslas seem to be the worst about it. Anything usuing partical effects will cause this issue as well. And its any event that has a high concentration of enemies, i was just usuing ACP as an example.
---
It sounds like you need to work on your build. The most challenging part of the silo is learning its layout. I think everybody gets caught off guard by an Assaultron in there sometimes, but by far it's not a difficult run to make. You can hack the terminals and shutdown the turrets... I'm level 566 and still take the time to do it. If you have Lockpick you can bypass the reactor part all together.
---
What are your perks?
---
Same here. I feel so inadequate, though.
---
This is similar to what I experienced on Xbox earlier. Plus graphics issues where half the screen would occasionally pixelate into weird static. And Earle kept getting stuck in the walls and disappearing over and under the map and stuttering/teleporting around the room. And my game crashed twice trying to do the event
---
So.. you have a better change of lightining striking the tip of your junk then anything good with legendary drops.. its grinder fodder..
---
It would help to know your special stats, cards equipped, and gear equipped. Without knowing those details and where exactly you are dying, people can't effectively give you the guidance you are looking for.
---
The more you die in a short amount of time, the more the counter stacks for each death. Iirc this has been in place since launch...
---
It just works!!! :)
---
This is why if I want to buy something from someone, I tell them to list the item on their C.A.M.P. vendor for the amount we agree upon, I join the same world as them by way of adding them as a friend, and buy the item for the price we agree upon. 
---
I can inspect the item on their vendor before buying it and when I'm satisfied the level and stats are correct, and the price they've listed it for is acceptable, I buy it. If they're buying from me, I list it for the price we agree upon and they either buy it or they fuckin' don't. How is this not already the way people are doing it?
---
You're a Raider on here.    
---
It's the apocalypse and Fallout's universe isn't nice. If you expect everyone to 'play nice and fair' you're misunderstanding the lore of and how Fallout works.    
---
I've never been able to launch a nuke myself (long story) but there are ways around that problem.  
---
That even is like 8 players for each instance. I'm not sure how grouping works in this but I'm sure you have to go in roughly at the same time or you could end up alone or with randos.
---
Oh I knew about the time increase. Usually when I fight the queen the highest my wait time has gone to is 15 seconds. But I didn’t know it could go up to a minute.
---
It’s a feature.
---
That update sounds awful tbh
---
Can you loot the collossus if you don't tag it for enough HP? Otherwise I'll be focusing on spawns all day. I've always felt the need to unload at least 500 rounds into the big guy to make sure I get the loot.
---
Anytime!
---
The browning is a good drop, but no where near as high as it gets.
---
When bethesda listens. 😅.... right...
---
I haven't done the event myself yet but from what I've seen so far, I believe there can be multiple instances. Of course in doing so, it would only make sense that the game were to fill up each instance(8 players each) on a first-come-first-serve basis before creating another.
---
Thank goodness for that.  I would've not been thrilled to go through those tedious nuclear silos missions again.
---
It actually wasn’t since launch. I believe it was updated a few months ago. When they decided that instead of you losing your loot when you died during events, instead you would get a timer to respawn. Highest I’ve normally gone to has been 15 seconds when fighting the queen. I never knew it could go up to a minute.
---
If it makes dealing with roses quest easier for low levels then idc end game isn’t hard anyway for finished builds
---
Yeah we saw a foot sticking though when he dissappered with like .5% go left luck explosive weapons killed him and he hung like a pinata
---
Yup. Access a denied and lock down
---
Like I said, try a Vamp heavy weapon, it's great.
---
TBH the quest is actually shorter then it originally was and there was a little more travelling but i know they shortened it from launch
---
i got a notification saying the data files were corrupted and had to redownload :)
---
Haven’t found one yet tbh.
---
Fallout first premium feature right 👍🏼
---
Ah poor you.
---
This I believe as they are a potential target for queen of the hunt.
---
Oh wow, that clears it up! Thanks!
---
It's not patched in the current version of the PTS, but it might be by the time patch 22 goes live.
---
Watched a video on it tonight and nah, none of the rewards are anything I want. I'd spend more on repairs to my armor afterwards than anything I'd get out of it.
---
I actually started playing after Wastelanders because of the new achievements. It meant that I no longer had every Fallout at 100%. Two excruciatingly long grinds later I'm back to all achievements acquired.
---
As has been said by many on this sub, scrip rng appears to behave in patterns. 
---
Ie) you are more likely to roll the same types of effects in a row, as long as you stay on the same server during that "rng" period.
---
To date, I haven't seen comprehensive proof, but rolling multiple of same types of prefixes in a row happens every time I roll 5-10+ of anything, whether that is scrip or crafting legendaries.
---
Idk what your talking about now. Im just saying bloodied is to op if i have to change weapons to not fuck ppl over in events than thats a problem. And thats with me not even having the really op bloodied weapons my bloodied handmade is 1 star and it vats tap kills everything besides bosses without alot of the buffs ppl abuse.
---
While this is true to an extent, its still frowned upon by a lot of them. Most switched to usuing lasers which still can cause the problem, but its not nearly as bad as the tesla. But I can only speak for the xbox crowd, idk how it is on any other platform.
---
Got  my ass handed many times before fixing my special cards.had too many quality of life cards not enough damage + resistance  cards
---
I have done it three times.  Killed once in each one due to being swarmed by spawns.  Respawned normally each time.  I use a Prime AA Gatling Plasma, same weapon I use on the SBQ.  My backup for the second and third times was  a Vampires FFR .50 cal, it shreds spawns and preserves my health.  I like to get up against a wall so the fear attack does nothing but pause my firing.  With all three Lvl 3 Heavy Gunner cards, Stabilized, Bloody Mess and a steady diet of Psycho I am getting 29 when I hit a face or the vocal sack. This is far less than the same weapon, perks and drugs get against the SBQ where I get 44-49 in the face.  Earl must have higher DR or armor than the SBQ.
---
Man, I made a post about this earlier today and commented about it elsewhere several times and didn't get squat for recognition about it.
---
Try the gauss minigun, it's pretty easy to get what you want, or trade for one, what platform are you on?
---
Long and behold. Somebody dropped a vampire Gatling plasma on the floor in grahm’s cookout
---
Lol it just goes like that sometimes. I hardly ever get above 50 upvotes
---
So disappointed that there's no Mushu in the remake.
---
I might be able to help. What time zone are you?
---
I totally agree with you
---
Well a whole lotta weapons that are bad now are gonna be worse off after the nerf.. at least for now..
---
as the others have mentioned, you probably need to work on your build. *just* having the stealth suit on means nothing if you don't have sneak 3, escape artist and reasonably high agility as well. and a silenced weapon of course.
---
there are also ways to skip most of the silo and go straight to the prep, if you're ok with abusing glitches.
---
people really downvoting this guy because hes using emojis
---
My first try on it I didn't die but I may have just got lucky. It helped that all my teammates were level 100-200.
---
There was a lot of hype about how much health it has but it seemed to go down in about the same time as the Queen would, 10-12 minutes without 'magic' weapons.
---
I imagine there is a lot of inconsistency from one run to another based on what level your teammates are and if you get unlucky and the scream runs you into one of the environment hazards.
---
No, that makes absolutely no sense. At a queen fight the entire server can be there and it doesn’t make a difference, and if they don’t deal enough damage they won’t even get any rewards. The only reason it’s an issue with the colossus is the 8 player limited capacity
---
I’m Alaska time zone. I can usually be on 6pm to 3am eastern time zone
---
So now you get to try it.  Granted I personally don't like plasmas, but who knows, try it and tell me.
---
that makes sense, bethesda hates making sense
---
Never noticed....until YOU mentioned it. Thanks a lot!!! 😎🙄🤨
---
You should do Encryptid more and try to be a pylon as a Bloodied build. Then you'll truly see how high that timer can go lmao
---
Depends on the enemy but yes too, hence "balance" :)
---
Are you doing the 'Grahm's Meat-Cook' event or the Primal Cuts events? Primal Cuts give you Prime Meat you can turn in at the Meat Cook for scrip as well as doing other tasks for the rewards in the spreadsheet.
---
hey np man. i just hate reddit supremacy
---
&gt;Demo is for any explosive weapon. Grenadier is for thrown explosives.
---
Then I must be doing something wrong.. cuz when I put my flamer on, then I add my demo perk I see no damage increase.. are you sure flamer counts as explosive weapon and not.. I donno "breath" weapon?
---
Yeah the way of Bethesda's shitty game design. Really need to quit playing until one wasteland or altogether.
---
Encrypted is actually an easy event. I’m not a pylon. But I noticed if I sneak with my bloodied shotgun and have covert training, I can kill it with 4-6 shots. 
---
But I know being a pylon drains you’re life like crazy
---
I’ll need a few plasma cores, but hopefully this prevents me from dying too much.
---
??? I’m doing the event the post is about
---
I don’t pay attention to the votes, unless I’m in the trading sub. Haha
---
Ever heard of the server’s capacity? I’m tired of failing the event because my buddies can’t get in because of the 5 level 20s that are huddled in someone’s survival tent and don’t understand that like you said, you have to deal a certain amount of damage to even get anything from it
---
Haha Bethesda definitely did that on purpose. Long wait, annoying tellers, and 297728 hoops to jump through just like the real DMV.
---
I got pretty lucky it seems, I was with a lvl 499, 250 and a 120, and me 208. Someone else ran in with us but I never saw them again. We succeeded with less effort than SBQ, someone must of had an amazing gun, I did some good damage as well. But if someone wouldn't have given the follow me emote I never would have made it out, and even then I ended up catching up to someone else to get out.
---
My biggest complaint would be not having enough time to loot anything other than earl without feeling like I needed to run
---
I am 110 and I feel like I dont belong there. My build sucks.
---
That quest line was worth slogging through all of the glitches and bugs up to that point.
---
Its seriously far better than the bulk of the super hero tripe getting released by the mainstream studios right now.
---
I didn't realize you had to stay put outside the mine sucking up radiation in order to complete the event.  My rad bar was fast filling so I fast traveled back to my camp prior to the collapse counter finishing, so I didn't get anything from that event.  
---
Sucks...  maybe you don't need to leave the mine completely when it collapses??  Won't make that mistake again .....probably heh
---
Imagine doing any boss event without a magic weapon to clear it in 20 seconds at any point you get bored of farming the free infinite wendigos.
---
Git gud
---
Perhaps they just don't want to rob someone else of the experience with spoilers.
---
In a PvP game it makes sense.
---
In a co-op game it just hurts everyone.
---
Why did you waste the time reviving them?  Once the writing was on the wall that it was a lost cause I would have just saved my stims
---
I chose to tell her about her dad and offer the watch and got nothing in return. Not mad at all about it. Just a little odd. I was expecting some diluted stims, floater grenades and missiles in return😒
---
Cool beans my gt is sloopy noodles
---
Prime 5.56 is a pain to farm now that nukes are rarer.
---
Me and a friend joined the event. There were only one guy there. So we were 3 in total. I died twice and reloaded my 50cal maybe 3 times. 
---
We both got wrecked by the rubble after Earl died and spawned outside the mine. I got "event completed" but he didn't.
---
It was nice to do something new. Not too hard.
---
I have a feeling the difficulty scales based on number of players.
---
Or you could attempt to not die as often. This way you avoid penalties associated with dying.
---
A whole minute to respawn after dying what, 6 times? This isn't on Bethesda man, this is on you.
---
S upermutants

---
One because I needed people to distract the Wendigo Spawns, two because some of them were level 50-60 and they may have done enough damage to make keeping them up worth it, instead of letting them take a minute to revive.
---
You are right tho, I shouldn’t have even bothered.
---
I've done a few on PC already and it's been memory building for sure. I had a similar situation; someone being down and saving them. Despite the obvious bugs, fps issue, respawn, (to name a few) this event shows the potential of this platform. I absolutely love the event. Love stories like this too.
---
Easy as heck if you're running a bloody stealth commando/rifleman though.
---
You can do it. Get over yourself.
---
I first ran daily ops with my bloodied HW/PA build. Probably one of the easiest to do it on (I didn’t know that at first, it’s just my main).
---
Then I ran it on my full-health junkies build. Usually unarmed, but I was using shotguns for the ops.
---
Then as an experiment I ran it on my bloodied stealth VATS rifleman. Almost the worst to do it on (bloodied melee is probably THE worst).
---
It was actually much easier than I expected. Charged Body shots with an instigating gauss rifle would oneshot all the regular enemies, and switching over to a Commando with a bloodied 1star handmade for the boss got her down fairly well too (freezing touch robots was my op). I died to her once or twice, but she’s just a brutal DPS machine. And I don’t run ANY tank perks. I will probably set up a perk loadout for that once they go livel
---
Fixer because you get multiple stealth shots not just one. Grim reaper sprint and gun fury will allow you to VATS burst the room down.
---
8 people on ACU only leaves like 10 people left. Assuming half are even doing events maybe 2 doing the one you want
---
Just don’t die/s
---
I wish they would make it that we could remake the mask. You drop that thing and you lose access forever
---
I can't die a single time. I have the respawn glitch every time I die. Try to stay back a bit and when the Wendigo hoards come flying get as far away from the Colossus as possible until you mop them up. There's a certain pattern for the event. If death is an issue stay far.
---

---
I went in with a group of 6 and we did pretty alright, we had 4 heavy gunners and since myself and another were stealth commando scum, we were on wendigo spawn duty. Had 7 minutes to spare but when I went to search the colossus, I was killed wasn’t able to pick up any of the loot. It was real fun regardless but when you get “screeched”, do everything to stay off those drills
---
Yep my setup exactly. I have an alt I trade with and run from Beth launcher and have pts as well. Add to that all the other fallout games. I'm pretty much running nothing but fallout on my rig.
---
Ammo is also harder to get early. I go rifleman til mid 50s, and then make the switch.
---
Not on xbox but I'll just throw some possible ideas your way that might help
---
1. Have people bring in power armor frames and set them up to block off each tunnel
---
2. Cripple the ghouls and then just go grab ore. You'll need to cripple them back far enough so that they don't get killed by the turrets or the scavengers.(a low level explosive shotgun with enforcer cripples incredibly easy). Crippling instead of killing should prevent anymore from spawning.
---
3. Don't turn in the ore until the timer is close to running out. I believe after a certain amount of ore is deposited, different enemies will appear(like deathclaws).
---
4. I'm not sure about "friendly fire" as I always seem to have trouble getting it to work in most situations.
---
5. If you want to get the highest level reward, you'll want at least 2 people grabbing ore. The ore doesn't respawn fast enough for 1 person to grab it all(and excavator PA does ***not*** give you additional ore)
---

This link works
---
There’s a clean picture of it in this Google document, not sure if you need the actual file though
---
I had some misinfo on the nerf i heard some stuff was gonna be buffed like aa but apparently its a nerf to everything thats dumb but bloodied does need a nerf imo.
---
That's OK, happy to help bro.
---
Exactly what I use VE 50 and it's beautiful.
---
I honestly loved a random protection that’s talked shit about a nearby dead guy. Been looking for him since lol
---
I got 2 successful runs today with only 7 players the first time (one being a lv 60 and nothing resembling a finished build or good weapons) and then again with 5 after the lv 60 and other were done after the first. We used my privet server and no one had any lag or respawn glitches.
---
Also, if you need screws, this event is the best possible source for them.
---
Well if 1 build is the best they should increase other builds as a buff .. makes more sense..
---
We just scraped by in our first go, pretty much everyone in my session was bloodied and would constantly drop, towards the end it was me and one guy as the only persistent players the rest were just cycled out with their death timers.
---
If I could change one thing it would be instadeath, the timer makes sense, you repeatedly die, you get punished but the fact I don't get a chance to revive anyone due to DoT is ridiculous.
---
Why is it so hard to understand they don’t know how lol or just can’t
---
See, this is the problem... The second they give us a challenge that makes people do more than crouch and hit the trigger people start complaining. How about trying to adapt to the circumstance presented? Strategize your approach instead of begging to make the whole event a snore fest. And yes, make it so you'll actually lose every now again if you're not adapting.
---
I was gone say something just like that lol .. you’ve gotta jab and move on em son ! 😅😂
---
Because rumors of these changes are going to affect 75% of the player base. Just an estimate and a thought. I don’t know though for sure
---
I fear now man, mutant, or beast, but that thing....it scares me
---
Considering they said they were looking at a more permanent fix to this issue, the fact that they reimplemented this little exploit tells me they gave up on their alternate solution
---
I’m with you man. 60 seconds is too long. That’s gotta be dealt with. I think they need to level lock the event the same way you can’t start Wastelanders quest until level 20. You shouldn’t be able to get into this event until at least level 40. WAS on a team, full squad, all of us between 200 and 500. We all fast traveled to the event. The other three guys got into an instance with five others. So they had a full 8. I got stuck with two people levels 14 and 19 in a separate instance. Scrappy and they got heart but they both got killed instantly and didn’t come back to the event. So after getting my 60 seconds of respawn waiting I was forced to dashboard and reload. So that was a totally wasted nuke for me. Nevermind that someone else literally launched a nuke 10 seconds after I launched mine.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
Awesome I’ll try that, I mostly care just to get it completed successfully regardless of the reward level.
---
My complaint is the respawn time. I don’t care if I die 20-30 times. Or if I lose caps each time I die. I just hate the respawn time. 
---
Crouch and hit the trigger? How does that work when I run around punching things, or running around with a shotgun and heavy gun?
---
I recorded gram singing meat week.
---
I did it and had a blast, my friend died a lot but I didn’t die once. Probably because I was constantly using my jet pack. I raced outside the mine and got out and got what I wanted the plushie.
---
I think the biggest help to the trader market right now would be an automated inventory to spreadsheet process.  I see a lot of trades that pique my interest but loading in a mule just to check if I have the desired items is a bother.  My inventory is so massive now that doing it manually is daunting and keeping it updated a chore.
---
With my vampire .50cal I can pretty much sit indefinitely under the boss as long as the ammo flows. Vamp weapons are definitely recommended for the colossus boss.
---
SBQ is in the open world, so I get it. With the collossus it’s an instanced indoor area. They could have a low level try to go in and hear the colossus scream “you hear a terrifying scream and decide not to go in” or something to block them.
---
LOL Look at all the salty downvotes This sub really is full of crybabies who just want a game that doesn't push or challenge them at all.
---
Reminds me of the time I saw a level 9 running with full speed with a machete to fight the queen. He got slapped and instantly died.
---
Lmao, beyond beyond
---
Imo they need a full rebalance buffing everything to be closer to boodied just makes the game easier its to easy as is and im a normie and the game isn't challenging it got to the point there with queen that itd die in 1 min if it landed.
---
I think most people are just knee jerk reacting to the changes because they got used to the damage they put out.
---
While the initial shock is gonna suck and take a bit to get used to, if this change makes weapons easier to balance im for it and think it would be more beneficial long term.  I would love to use the AR for example, but the handmade/fixer just straight outclass it across the board.  I'd love to use a gunslinger toon with a .44, but borderline anything just stomps on pistols.
---
I get the feeling. From all the stories that I've been seeing, it kinda seems that you need to have a build with high dps as well as strong survivability(makes sense). The usual problems seem to be not enough damage to take down the boss or people just dying from the large number of mini-wendigos.
---
Uhm, it isn't this hard. We two manned it repeatedly this morning, used a few hundred bullets.
---
Honestly even at 8 people my Xbox was lagging and music cutting out. Couldn’t imagine anymore, even if it would be nice
---
I didn't do it on purpose, but hey, 200 GBs later... I'm set.
---
I'm always there whenever the event opens. Solo one person, doesn't matter I'll always do it.
---
 Actually I'll leave only if I get that Tesla freeze up.
---
Lotza pointy tingz, Lotza boiz, if yer reely wantin ta make em feel da pane bring da looted eavy flamah wit ya az well. Maybe even wun O dems green flamaz too cuz dey doent set da beast on fire dey just melt da face cleen offff. For da sake of Mork (Or Gork) make sure ya bring da waaaghh wit ya too, never av enuf wagghh to giv em big leg creepy buggaz down in da hole.
---
And now ads consistently spawn inside things in workshops making it impossible to clear. Had 7 hounds inside the concrete stairs at lakeside cabins right after the earlier update. Another in the tinker station. Whack a mole for glitches.
---
I plan to just kill my boyfriend over and over because I never pvp
---
Only legacy flamers count towards it bro. Your weapon has to say explosive as a prefix or it won’t work. Put in max bloody mess and stabilized if you in pa. Regular flamers are considered energy damage I believe.
---
Nah bud you are just an asshole
---
Did you get the taxidermy already? Imo it's the best camp reward from the event
---
Side note: press your "activate" button on the plushie
---
Also if you use a chem and a big guns bobble head it will be a decent increase to damage output
---
As Arnold Schwarzenegger once said “If it bleeds, we can kill it.”
---
*Used charcoal.
---
Does the one from path to enlightenment work?
---
Brothers! Bring..... THE HEAVY FLAMER!!! BURN THEM IN RIGHTEOUS FIRE!
---
Why *would* you care how many times you died if there was no penalty for it? There has to be a draw back to dying otherwise it's meaningless.
---
This event has been running a lot smoother the last 3 times. The first one just after maintenance today was god dreadful and full of frame rate drops and lag. 
---
But much much much better the last few tries tonight. Hopefully I just didn’t jinx myself.
---
Certain guns can have an extremely broken and unintended outcome due to certain combos of legendary effects and firerates
---
Well, I loot until the mine collapse on me, when it does you don’t die you just get teleported outside to the nuke zone and got all the loot, at least that’s how it is for me!
---
Aww crap, that's what I get for not paying attention. Got my posts mixed up. Ok, so this is the list of things you will get at the end of the event...not off the Wendigo Colossus body nor the trunks at the end. These will be shown on a splash screen and automatically be put into your inventory.
---
How are you not used to this by now? Doing vault79 3 star sentry bot blows and disappears then final reward is nocturnal wood legs. I did get a bloodied combat shotgun that hits like a tank from the purveyor though.  First decent weapon in months.
---
Do you play on pacifist?
---
Good to know thanks
---
I think they will, and they better fix the health rubber banding with shotguns and buff them after the fix..
---
Still, it’s kind of depressing that those were your expectations for a reward and even those weren’t met
---
Pretty sure that was me. Got killed by him, and the game froze during the load for respawn. 
---
In all seriousness, he was almost dead and of course I had to close the game down so I still haven’t beaten the bastard.
---
Nope
---
Bloodied build?  I only died once other than falling down the shaft when we dropped in.
---
Yup I mentioned it somewhere lower in that thread that I use pacifist &amp; op should also to avoid things of that sort.
---
I would be if the Steam achievements were not broken.
---
Yes. There has to be a draw back. Agree with you 100%. But not a minute. 30 seconds and I’ll be happy with that.
---
Even if you can get it from any loot or event reward, you still cant putt it in any container of the game cause its not tradable 
---
For me its hacked item for sûre.
---
Yesterday, I saw a guy with a character name suggesting he is hacking, he was level 1 and got SS chest and underarmor. The chest being level 40 minimum item when you craft it.
---
What's the new gas mask?
---
Don’t bring your gauss shotgun it’s useless in there unless you’re only going after the basic wedingo and if you’re doing that you’re kinda wasting a space in there
---
I know how it works my guy.  I’m saying this isn’t what I’ve been getting.
---
The wendigos dropped a lot of ultra 5mm for me.  Keep coming out way ahead with a gating gun.
---
Fuckin a, got old real quick. I bitched on party chat the whole time.
---
The Flamer brother, The HEAVY FLAMER!... Or the Plasma flamer. Nothing screams badass in that cavern like being swarmed by around 20 wendigos at once, then screaming in the mic "BURN IN HOLY FIRE!" as you watch an entire wendigo army crumble to your might. The low levels will praise the day they saw a valiant knight not only slaughter an entire army, burn them to cinders, but then follow up to shove the barrel of that flamer so far up the Colossus's arse that he explodes into microscopic pieces!
---
I don’t find it to hard. Done it upwards of 10-15 times. Only once with powerarmor. One time me and one other guy did it because I didin’t notice that the last guy left hahah. I do agree with you though, the boss is a bullet sponge
---
I mean we get those for everything else we do in the game. It’s either that or 40mm grenades and handful of .38’s and some purified water. Nah this time I’m totally fine not getting in return from something like that. Saves me the trouble of dropping it from my inventory.
---
Free states nice
---
What are you getting? I've done this event enough that I've gotten every reward off this list and never got anything that was unexpected.
---
&gt;People are assholes
---
Yup, I am living proof
---
I think it’d be really neat. I agree, but also think some of them could cater to mid level players or players with suboptimal gearing. Perhaps not all should be true endgame content.
---
Thanks mate, unfortunately I need the 3d model. Tried doing what I need in game with a mock up green screen but it's damn near impossible with the lighting and lack of a solid colour wall paper.
---
ah, like?
---
Or drop on queen and still do Earle ;-)
---
Drop a nuke on the Penitentiary, Mad Dog Malone the Behemoth.   Fight waves of super mutants, waves of guard robots, could really have a fun, chaotic mess.
---
With color commentary by the Graaaaaaafton Mayor, naturally.
---
I set an alarm, I jump in to 76 or my tent (if MIT spawned) and run over a minute or two early, grab a drum or spit if one's available and wait for Grahm to shout "Start now humans!" 
---
Then its greens, prime meat, wood, trash and poo, and chally feed til its done. 
---
I usually cant do half that list before it hits 100% and Grahm is tossing me yet ANOTHER outfit or flag plan. 
---
Big dumb green bass turd. Nah, I love Big G.
---
200+ firerate in combo with bash damage is the only one I know by memory
---
You know he definitely earned those lvls properly
---
Use the terminal and change the collection mode.  Surprised you haven't even thought to try this yet.
---
It's an option in your display settings, "Show Player Names" or something to that effect.
---
The event is at Plyon Ambush Site and you need to craft a keycard?
---
Not if you defense right.
---
It's a bug.  You should be able to enter if you wait around that area for a minute or two.  If it doesn't work, try fast traveling away and back again.  If *that* doesn't work, try another server.
---
60% of the time, it works every time
---
Seriously it can and often does but its still a struggle (at least with a mouse).
---
Waited four hours to find out the types of mail and ID were insufficient. Went to a different city and was in and out in fifteen minutes. More whiplash than being rear-ended.
---
The 7 minute wait to start the event is a little extreme
---
I had a blast with the event today, it’s so much fun. It’s crazy how little damage weapons do to the colossus, if the SBQ has a 70% flat damage reduction than the colossus must have like 90% because a few of my heavy weapons were barely making a scratch, only my bloodied gauss mini made noticeable damage and it’s hard to keep that thing fed with ammo lol
---
It is fantastic - needs more content and a second phase.
---
Seriously, I'd rather the MOM were back and active than the BOS or Crater or Foundation ...
---
Wouldn't that be a fun daily event? Stealth MoM escort ...
---
* Blow up something
---
* Eliminate some targets (Blood Eagle? Raider?)
---
* Retrieve something
---
* Escort
---
Even better if there was an optional stealth-XP ... so if you complete the blow-up or the retrieve or escort w/o killing you get more XP (and you kill after, but maybe reward different play option)
---
I did. I have the faschnact collectron, I only saw options to swap between those two
---
*edit* ooooooh. So it’s super not clear if it’s the first time you’re using it and you have another collectron. 
---
There’s a Revolutionary mode and a Proletariat mode. I didn’t realize it was already in one of those modes, and it was offering me to switch to the *other* mode, OR fasnacht.
---
Nope. They need a filter key, like they already know to do for crafting, press (whatever key) and all player icons vanish. Press again and the all come back. Or maybe a 3 state: players, events, both.
---
It's not the greatest boss setup. You can get away with the full health and stealth suit, but the bow really sets you back. You should find a good automatic rifle and go stealth commando. You won't have to move and special points around, just get the commando cards to replace the bow ones. That way you can freely swap them out for regular play and boss level events.
---
Some items *do* display in the case, but the model for them sits too low on the display shelf, so it sinks into the shelf itself.  For example:  The lunchbox can be displayed, but it sinks too far down into the shelf.  The Commendation and other small, flat items do the same so they essentially get blocked out of view because they're "inside" the shelf itself.
---
As someone who loves halo I completely agree (especially Halo 1). Best in-game event!
---
This is probably a stupid question given how its started, but can it be done in normal armor or do the rads from the nuke reach inside too?
---
I think you pissed off the soup Nazi
---
'No soup for you!'
---
(Seinfield reference for people who are not OLD like I am)
---
Yeah plus this is harder than Scorched earth
---
Unloaded a couple thousands rounds, wasted repair kits and stims and the low levels couldn’t hold their weight so I quit when I realized it wasn’t going to happen. Feels like a group project from school.
---
I'm glad you posted this, I thought I was going crazy
---
I'm not sure i'm following your logic.  Place down the **Communist** Collectron, then use the terminal attached to it and change it's resource collection mode.  It will collect soup on one of the 2 options.
---
I’m just getting guns.  No plans no masks no plushie. No meat pile.  Shit ton if rad away tho and a few flux
---
So I just set up 2 bunkers near sbq and nuked myself. They get destroyed. Everything in them gets destroyed.
---
Heavy builds are the best for this event. Sadly my BE .50 isn’t that great as although it can kill most enemies in a few hits Earle is almost entirely immune to explosive damage so it’s effectively a 1* bloodied .50
---
&gt;; taking someone else fun/loot, so you can feel cool/strong, isn't ok
---
But that's what you are doing when you tell them to use other weapons. It works both ways. You should be angry at game developers and tag them.
---
I went in with two others. I was with a heavy guns PA build with a gatling laser, one friend was grenade launcher crowd control and the other friend was bait. We did it by ourselves after waiting for Grahm's Meat Week to finish and were out of the mine before anyone could be bothered to come help.
---
Yah see my edit, sorry.
---
"1 year!"
---
Rads don't reach inside the mine, so no need to worry. You will need to be prepared for rads once you evacuate the mine after the event ends.
---
Damn it. Is that you? Bat cave below, church on the top? I got trapped in there until I managed to marsupial jump up into the church.  
---
My survival tent was inside there and when I logged back in it spawned me inside the cave but in a players base and they had sealed the cave entrance with foundations. 
---
😖😂😡
---
Sure give me a message on Reddit with your Xbox name,i'd add you after work
---
lol. Yeah, I'm an asshole alright 'bud', how dare I point out that its the OPs fault for being stuck with a 60 second timer. I guess it was me that made the other people in here post essentially the same thing eh?
---
Revolutionary setting will gather frags, swords, blood pacs and propaganda. Proletariat gets the foods
---
I understand, but in another perspective I remember when SBQ was discovered it was a pain in the ass and now it is too easy. Maybe wait a couple of days or weeks to People understand mechanics and strats to kill it efficiently.
---
Go to queen: stand around for 20 minutes waiting for her to land... someone kills her within 20 seconds... get flux... get nocturnal +perception fatman... piss off to scrip machine. 
---
Go to colossus: not waiting for him to land...immediate battle place... nowhere for him to hide or run to... tons of mobs that drop ammo I’m using and screws... 3* legos (possibly 2 at a time)... takes more than 20 seconds to kill... still get flux (not as much or an assortment but whatever)...
---
Second this^
---
is there any guns that would suit that commando setup that you could reccomend?
---
Yeah, well, Mushu wasn't the sharpest bulb in the shed.
---
That’s my issue I’ve tried it three times going in in a full group and I always get put into a solo session. I could kill him in the allotted time, but I always have one scream that takes me into a drill. So back to square one with him at full health.
---
I have a vampire's magic shotgun, it's perfect for this. I don't die at all.
---
Is Colossal Problem on console yet? And do the rewards make it worth doing?
---
Probably doesnt have pacifist on.
---
No.
---
The only complain I have is flux rewards : harder boss than SBQ needs better flux rewards
---
Im also using healing salves, all you need are bloodleafs and blue flowers. 
---
Bloodleaves are found almost everywhere you have moving water, soot flowers are plenty in the forest.
---
I mostly start with green thumb and aquaboy at flatwoods where the fertile soil event happens (vault tec agrar culture i think) and move north to the wayward, following the river. The wayward has several flowers, also plenty are around the overseer camp. Then I mostly wander around the river for the bloodleaves, once I hit Morgantown I teleport to harpers ferry, jump down the bridge and collect a lot more bloodleaves, till I have about 70-100. Then I'll make sure i have the same amount of flowers, grab a lot of dirty water and go to the next chem station equipping super duper.
---
I'll get about 330 salves each run, with a bit of practice and knowhow where the flowers are you get this done within 15mins, 20 with crafting.
---
I like the SMG because it's noisy and raw. Let it be.
---
Pro tip: don’t die.
---
If you want full God rolls, it is.
---
It is. Every fallout game I’ve ever played I did rifleman. The bonuses in 76 make automatic much better. Even if you just shoot it semi auto, you have the flexibility to do full auto. Sad to say that. I used to always use a hunting rifle with 50 cal all through the game. Got rid of it almost immediately. Used auto pipes longer then hunting rifle

How do you call a pack of wendigos? A Scream of wendigos.
---
A few pieces of troubleshooters armor, a trouble shooter long range weapon if you are a melee build (helped me with the turrets), matching damage perks for your build, a few defensive perks matching your build, lockpicking or hacking lvl 3, hotkey stims, a few damage boosting narcotics, and have your PA available for the reactor before you get close to it. It's a bitch the first time through, then after you know what's coming, they get easier. Note: Personally, I recommend stealth throughout the entire first silo run to prevent a silo snipe, which would suck if your trying to complete the quest.
---
I’ve personally only experience the lag from Tesla’s on PS4. But get enough legacy’s in one area and lag is gonna happen. But same lag will happen if there is like 10 ppl at whitesprings
---
If you have pacifist mode turned on you can't hurt them even if they are wanted.  Trying to claim a bounty opens you up to pvp, they are allowed to fight back.
---
How exactly do I do this trick? I want double sided walls for my house
---
great, thanks!
---
Ah I figured that was the case... I’m hoping they fixed it since it was basically the only reward we got from the event, but I’m not holding my breath.
---
The fact that you think that false equivalency is true, is quite telling. No, telling someone to stop ruining others fun is NOT the same as what you're saying.
---
It's about balance. Everyone should have the ability to enjoy the fight, and not get their frame rate dropped to 1. Everyone, not a select few. Being asked to change weapons so that ALL may enjoy doesn't make you have less fun; you're still doing the fight, still earning the loot.
---
that's a pun I can get behind :)
---
In the floor decor with the sitting and standing gorillas for some reason.
---
An app would be just fine.
---
An app would allow you to sell everything from your inventory, and buy anything from everyone else’s.
---
Bor that's all they go after at my camp everything else is left untouched
---
Did it and got a meat pile plan.  Lol wtf kinda reward is that.
---
In that case, it seems to be hacking AND duping.
---
Once upon a time someone told me that scarecrows are supposed to draw enemy attention but I don't think I've ever seen evidence one way or the other.

You sound salty now

Did he ask why it was happening though? 
---
No shit they know why it’s happening 
---
If you haven’t noticed there’s a few other threads on the same topic all in agreement with ops point
---
Place down a door wall variant. Then place a full wall in the exact same spot facing the other way. Youll see it snap to it. Then replace the door wall to a full wall.
---
I had to go grab groceries and help my dad clean out his work vehicle. 
---
I sat on one of the spits, and was actually out of sync with the spit when I got back, looks like I [completed the event 5 or 6 times] (https://thumbs.gfycat.com/EmbellishedRadiantArmyant-max-1mb.gifbased) based on the plans I received.
---
I run those on a commando , psycho as 5th. Been pretty good imo
---
IBS Gang depressedly represent.
---
Lol earls drops are trash just go outside and complete event
---
Crazy as it sounds the hunter prefix is better for the Queen. Tested it myself.
---
Did you learn the other guass weapons, which are not vanilla weapons?
---
Would spice things up for sure
---
I don’t bother with it because the frames are atrocious, I can deal with the ear rape by just having the game on mute during the event, but my god that frame rate is the worst. Get more flux from queen anyway and it’s faster and tolerable
---
Well, the Fixer and Handmade are the metas for commando.. But honestly the combat and Assault rifles are just as effective, the difference in DPS between all of them is minimal. If you're going high health you'll probably want Furious, or Junkies if you're going that route. Faster Fire Rate as a secondary effects is the best for bosses.
---
Another players can loot your collectron
---
There was a communist collectron bot on the atom shop that allows you to get a few frag grenades, two broken chinese swords(9 steel) and 2 blood packs and propaganda fliers that can sold to vendors for 1 cap each.
---
Iv'e been using this to stock up, if i set it to that setting for a week i have like 60-80 blood packs....provided you play alot and constantly harvest. I end up selling all my extra stimpacks in player vendors because i have too many!
---
Also the broken chinese swords are good for steel scrap, esp. since i have a lead deposit on my property allowing me to get consistent steel and lead. I also make nuka grenades by buying nuka colas off becket then harvesting my frag grenades and making more.
---
I know it doesn't help you now, but if you ever see it on the atomic shop again the communist collectron, go ahead and buy it! Totally worth it!
---
I don't play bloodied or junkie's because it's the meta and everyone wants the gear so it's the most duped stuff sold for cash. Same with explosive energy weapons. Stealth + instigating was the most powerful effect not  meta to make otherwise mediocre weapons viable. Now they took that away and 2 of my stealth builds / weapons are instantly obsolete and probably not worth the respec since you need to grind the levels to earn points to move SPECIAL attributes and pick up new card sets and weapons with a gimped BGS negated build. BGS made pistols, bows, semi auto rifles complete garbage. Mele is also destroyed. It wiped non bloodied /junkie's snipers out of the game and mele is a joke now even when using bloodied due to stealth being gimped to irrelavancy.  I wanted to play non bloodied gunslinger, but had to settle for an instigating stealth sniper as it was the only viable alternative. It was either that, or heavy gunner. I already have an alt which does that. I agree this just makes bloodied/ junkie's the only way not to spend half your time grinding for ammo and repair mats due to the bullet sponge enemies non meta players will encounter.
---
Problem: I play it on Steam xd, anyway thx for the intention. So you basically play the event and thats it, you get screws? I play the event for the free addessive, just need to hit 1 of those Bees and the levels 200+ kill them and just loot the corpses, and as a level 35, thats usefull (+ the xp)
---
But doesn’t it have a great loot reward?
---
That could very well be my next squirrelly build. I was honestly hoping Grahm would drop me a broadsider.
---
Idea, instead of having events have recommended levels, they have minimum levels, if you aren't that level, you can't join the event.
---
F
---
Atleast you got some screws! (I assume)
---
Meh, I wasn’t impressed, after you get the cosmetics it’s pointless unless you really want the cursed weapons which aren’t really worth it IMO
---
Okay, so in terms of finding the quad effect, is there any way other than just getting supremely lucky?
---
Yeah I wanna get the loot so I can use them for trades in the future
---
I use the first 4 you mentioned plus med x. It works well.
---
Only new gas mask I can think of is the white raider style one. If so then it can't be traded as its an item from the legendary run.
---
Exactly. I know low levels want to join and have fun, but it's not fair to us higher levels. This isn't the Scorchbeast Queen. Everyone can join and kill her. But Earle is a beast that requires the best
---
You could try getting a new Chassis and scrapping the old one
---
How dare you put me on that "every body liked it" group. I did not know it was a thing, my camps are basic simple places to do the basics.
---
No problem man, hopefully one of the data miners will see your post and get you what you need
---
I havent had that problem, the randoms are always doing ok in my cases and if 1 or 2 people arent doing anything it doesnt matter, but maybe i just had luck
---
On pc there are a lot of hackers, also a strong cheat tool public available for everyone for more then a year now which gets sadly improved over time and outplays bethesda with each patch.
---
With the exception of Fixer plans all of my plans are 10 caps or less regardless if rarity.  I don't even bother with super common ones like ivory grips or that damn chemistry bench that seems to be all over the wasteland.
---
Is this still happening?
---
I... maybe? I have ones attack my camp all the time, so I just used that. If you can, try to use a glowing one - there’s a separate challenge for a glowing moth.
---
It's Encryptid all over again. People avoid it because it's tough and unfamiliar. Give it some time and people will start getting better at it and join more often.
---
If they go live as-is in PTS then absolutely. Otherwise it's a wait and see what balancing corrections  they might provide to counter the lopsidedness they created.
---
Also make sure you don't reload too early otherwise you have the full weight of a fusion core or plasma core and only have like 20 bullets on it.
---
So... bring tens of thousands of 50 cal. Got it.
---
With stealth he's super easy.
---
Without you can cripple him, his attacks are easy to dodge and the spawns are less of a threat than radiation rumble and there are places you can go that they can't if you want to cheese it.
---
Once I did it with one other guy in the group who probably did as much damage as me.  Every other time I've basically soloed it as the other players were useless or were farming Wendigo which is almost the same thing.
---
Over all it's very easy if you can keep a level head and not get your head leveled by falling debris.
---
Make a new character.  Join a friend's world.  Surely you have friends from trading, right?  Put stuff in a random but easily accessible public loot box, ice chest, steamer trunk, ideally outside.  Quit and join the SAME world with your other character and loot.  Most people don't loot random containers that typically have nothing interesting.  You should be fine.
---
They are cryptics
---
Sounds like you’re just bad tbh
---
Have it be a pull-string kind of thing, where every time you activate it, it says something or sings.
---
I want mt freakin helmet.  I grinded all that bs and was so excited to make it.  Then I go into 3rd  person and im like WTF!!!
---
You couldn't have just left? It's not like Bethesda will do anything.
---
Go throw them in a lake and leave the server. They're most likely duped.
---
Isn’t it a limited time event?
---
Im getting lag and frame problems here and there, but that's not the main issue I have with the event.
---
Well guess we better keep upvoting then if we really want it ;3
---
Players on the server I was on last night were pretty considerate too as they all timed the event so it didn't clash with Grahms cook out. Everyone got a chance to do both. There was no camps in the area so don't know how considerate they would have been on that front.
---
I've been playing since the Wastelanders update and haven't experienced much griefing, but when I first tried the agility course in Back to Basic, someone kept deliberately blocking my path by putting power armour in the way.
---
Im not really a taxidermy kinda guy. It does look cool tho.
---
Say that again to two mates which got temporarily suspended. They got unbaned after contacting the support tho.
---
Prime it, just need to nuke whitesprings for fluorescent flux one or two times and u will be set with thousands of ammo
---
IM COMING BACK BOYS
---
No, it will be like the sbq
---
It sucks dude everything literally everything targeted me and only me and I died so many times that before Earle died I died and had to wait a minute to respawn and I spawned out side the mine and didn’t get anything from Earle this event blows
---
What about the screws?!?
---
I just leveled up my one and only character to lvl 20 last night. 👍👍Making my way slowly.
---
Oh shit niiice, that’s good I thought it will be gone in awhile. Was it ingame before?
---
I just finished it on Xbox and holy lag.  Somehow our group finished but I have to assume everyone shared what I experienced.   The lag was so bad I couldn’t hardly locate Earle to shoot at.  Just had to stimpak up, VATS, and hope you hit something.
---
Yeah, I jumped into that earlier today not knowing what was gonna go down... Used half my stims and over two thousand rounds of ammo, with 4 other people. Aside from Wendigoes being Wendigoes, fun fight.
---
They are definitely duped.
---
Not that im aware of. They add in things over time, like the wastelands.
---
Ammo is ammo who cares? And the only other ammo factory requires you to fully side with the raiders
---
I want rewards lol
---
Cool cool, thanks for the info!
---
I was in one with 4 other people. I am level 70. I didn't need to use but 1 stimpak for a stray wendigo while escaping because not even 10 seconds in some dweeb ends up killing it. I don't know how. I did deal damage but I guess it didn't matter because I got no loot from him.
---
 cant even escape properly or survive long enough to escape.. good thing rewards are guranteed...
---
Another hidden feature? Turrets learn from their fallen comrades how to better resist you :D
---
Are these 20% cores ultracite cores? Power armors won't work with them
---
It’s believed that if you join while on a team it reserves four slots even if you’re alone on the team. So if there are 6 people in an instance and you join while on a team it would place you in a new instance since your whole team wouldn’t fit. That’s the prevailing theory I’ve seen. 
---
The chest is down the exit path. It’s kinda hard to miss, as you’re running through you hit a small area with the chest and several other high value junk laying around on tables and such
---
I really liked it, I was hoping there would be a Silver Shroud tie-in but the story really didn’t need it, truth be told.
---
Welp. Play the way you want to play, and I’ll keep admiring the fucking amazing houses y’all build that look better than Bethesda’s buildings
---
I don't think it is, plus PC version of fo76 is plagued with hackers and hacked weapons while consoles are not.
---
I’ve died more from the hazards than Earl. In fact he hasn’t killed me once.
---
Got another plushie plan on my second run lol
---
Yeay more cursed scrips!
---
Console port problem then.  Works fine on pc.  I've never seen a hacked weapon on pc.
---
Interesting... This is exactly the answer I’m looking for, Danke schön. So basically just don’t be on a team then when doing it with randoms.
---
Are the rewards worth it?
---
What's your build look like?
---
Cursed scrip?
---
OOooo I want a Vampire's. I have two magic shotties but man it would be nice to have a healing version. I don't think you could ever die, not as long as your armor is decent.
---
I don’t even know what I am at this point but I literally got targeted by everything there was at least like 7 other people there but everything ran past them to attack me
---
I think, the chest you're talking about is just literally before the exit on the right on your way back after killing Earl- can only be accessed after killing him.
---
same with scorched earth, one session there was like me my friend and 2 other people who could do damage yet there were like 5 people that were &gt;lv 45 and they just sat there doing nothing and dying
---
Only 8 players per event so you have to join fast. If nobody was going to do it nobody would have launched a nuke
---
lol
---
I'll send you one, when i get home :)
---
Yeah the card scrapping mechanic isn't fantastic I'll give you that. It kills one of the better aspects of this game, build flexibility.
---
This game blows. Welcome to the party.
---
Cursed weapons. There are three melee weapons with preset legendarys. The harpoongun is magic when applying the shotgun mod, but all of these are set with -90% weight making them ideal for scrips since they are named cursed making it easier to find them in the inventory.
---
It’s a matter of luck. So you can scrap legendaries now for a chance to spend the currency (scrip) to roll a new legendary item, it’s likely one that gets scrapped a lot (non-damage effect). Just send me a message on xbox and i’ll see if i can help you find one
---
Sometimes it does but sometimes it doesn’t
---
Ah I see... I’ve only been down the exit once and I was in a panic because I couldn’t find it right away, made it to the exit with literally 10 seconds so I didn’t stop and look, I’ll be sure to next time though.
---
Eyup, so when my build works in all hut one place, it can no longer work because I would have to change it for that one place, meaning it won't work anywhere because of legendary cards forcing me into a corner
---
End chest? Where is that? It's so dark in the mine, I can barely see anything. And it's a large space :(
---
It doesnt blow for about 2 weeks every update then quickly blows again.
---
Earle is a real ammo sponge, it’s just not fair for one or two players to do the job and a bunch of participants just pick up screws and get reward. They should limit the participants level and also raise the minimum damage bar. SBQ is only 1000 right? Earle deserves a lot higher.
---
They didn't get banned for this. Nobody has.
---
I find it weird making someone’s dad into a marketable plushie.
---
We had 8. 6 people there, plus us 2
---
Resilient annoys me more than freeze. The freeze effect only kicks in if they're close to you, so get weapons with more range.
---
I agree with what you're saying. However, given the history of "updates" in this game, I feel like it's too easy for this nerf to end up being just that and not actually going to be of real value later on. 
---
As many Fallout youtubers have pointed out, they've gone about this all wrong. There is a way to still rebalance things without such an insane nerf to all weapons. This is something Bethesda has to get right or they're going to lose a lot of players.
---
Well, I guess you're good looking to Wendigos lol. Anyway, the perk Blocker will go a long way to mitigating a lot of damage in there. You should also consider Serendipity... And don't be afraid to fall back until you lose some aggro. Eventually players will get better and better at the event and it will feel more cooperative rather than everyone for themselves. It was the same at the beginning with Scorched Earth, and again with Encryptid. So to will it happen with this event.
---
You can actually, if you teleport to your party member or a friend, whos inside, i did 2 Earl kills in a row that way, one with event teleport and one with friend teleport (he was in another group)
---
A lot of people, myself included, consider it the best quest in the game! I want them to come back in a DLC
---
It’s dumb because I would even go into places they couldn’t hit me and they would still try to go after me then after like 2 minutes they go after someone else the second I land I’m dead
---
Sure, you know better then people who were affected by... 
---
How's your day todd?
---
Wendigos spawns are the best part, one event I walked out with 500 screws
---
Thank you! PC player here and people complaining about having to actually be challenged is a pain in the A.  
---
The bugs about spawning outside the mine are fine but people complaining that they can't kill the thing in 10 minutes have been too over powerered for too long.
---
They've made a lot of changes to the legendary perk system, hopefully they fix the system to make scrapping cards more optional.
---
Me and a few others found a spot on the other side of where you drop in that it can’t get to you and you can just keep shooting it
---
Here is a quick tip, get a Vampires weapon.  
---
A Vampires 50 cal or minigun will keep you alive as long as you have things to shoot at.  And there is tons to shoot at in the Colossal Problem event...
---
The first time through I only stayed alive because I had a ton of stims and could spam them while in PA.  The second time around I bought my Vampires Explosive 50 cal.  Didn't even come close to dying...
---
I run HW and have been experiencing rubber banding too. It's ridiculous.
---
I crashed upon event start and was locked out of the event upon respawn. Goddamn Bethesda, that was my first experience.
---
Im planning on trying out my insurgent. But I also have a pristine mining uniform that I'm going to test with it.
---
I also streamed where it died in 6 seconds, which from now on I always run to it and put in some decent shots just incase this happens again.
---
Just got 2 a vamps Gatling plasma which is ok i need to mod it and I got a vamps fr Gatling gun
---
No. All we get is the same boring and repetitive content we have already, I assume you already know the roadmap. Beth won't listen since they don't care at all.
---
Actually not that hard if you have a decent Vampire weapon to counter heal. I advice using a V/E GP although not everybody has the possibility to use such a weapon it makes this fight (as far as staying alive goes) a childsplay.To do dmg to earle you have to use a magoc weapon otherwise you wont deal enough damage.
---
Watch innovsurvivalist's latest YouTube post. She shows all the bloodied weapons under PTS nerf. Meat hooks will suck.
---
Lvl 50 with somewhat of a build and some not bad weapons you mean? Not the case for 90% of 50lvl players. I had to carry group of players, lvl 30, lvl 55 and lvl 60. I hope lower lvl players focus more on vendigo spawns, so they dont stagger me while im focusing Earl with magic gatling lazer. Got a kill but wasted like 15 min to do it
---
My tank build is finally relevant with this event; I basically melee the boss while facing him away from the party and blocking pretty judiciously. Prefer to have a wall behind me for when the fear effect sends you running away so I can just turn around and keep wailing on him. Frees up all the bloodied mini-gunners to just expend their surplus ammo and makes the run so much smoother.
---
Hope not
---
Usually takes no more than 10 minutes and you can sometimes leave with more ammo than you came with . Not sure what the fuss is about
---
If you re joined in the same team you can fast travel to one of your team mates and you'll end up inside the mine.
---
Are you hoping for more? What motivate you continue playing this game? Just curious.
---
I went 4-1 tonight with Earle. The one loss was do to crazy lag but the wins ran smoothly and the action was intense
---
"What?!?!?!"
---
"Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"
---
Alright, once again: balance is not nerfing. If you complain about the lower damage numbers, see the whole total. Stop whining and wait for the update to see yourself or check the pts and play it. Its not what you whiners are thinking.
---
But not if your trying to do the event
---
My favorite part was the 5fps on my new xbox one x. boo..
---
Sorry if someone already asked, but how do we do the whole double-sided walls thing?????
---
Another problem I encountered, not enough players.  My first attempt, solo, nobody else joined.  Second attempt, 3 players including myself, barely got health down, seems to auto heal to full health if all players go down (Has anybody else experienced this?).  Third attempt, full party, almost took the entire time, but we killed it.  I burned through 1500 .50 rounds and about 6 fusion cores.
---
That would've been lovely lol
---
Junkies is magic tho, not a surprise, i did the same lazergat j/33
---
By any chance, are you selling or trading for your spare mask? If so, I am very interested. I'm on PS4.
---
The event is a welcome challenge, but the bugs are killing me. I only got to play it twice. The first time, I wasn't aware of the traps, and I did it with one other person (presumably the guy who launched the nuke).  We lost Earle for 2 minutes or so, when we found him, he was in the ceiling, and we could only shoot his feet. If not for that, we would have beat it. 
---
The second time, we had a full crew. While we beat it handily, it was still quite the challenge; especially when the whole event got so pixelated, it looked like an 8 bit Atari game.
---
I am not hoping for anything for a long time now, still I surprisingly got disappointed most of the time. The only reason I kept playing was my community.
---
The event is in many ways a "build test". Its a high level event meant for optimised builds &amp; is harder than anything else in the game right now.
---
So dupers will have even *more* incentive to dupe the good ol TSE weapons. 
---
With duping still being a big reality in this game, Bethesda will just make it so instead of many people looking for magic duped weapons, nearly all will be. 
---
Good job.
---
I've never failed the event whilst still looting if you get a good team who isn't underleveled
---
No when the enemies kills you after the scorched queen event you loose all your junk you had been the junk you just earn, say for example, after you killed a schorched queen and finish the event you try avoiding enemies from killing you and go to nearest camp and quickly storenyour junk, nbut if you get killed right after the event is over all your junk will be gone depends if they didn't find your loot first, happens to me all the time and ppl tposing me for no reason
---
i come back every few weeks since beta, but wastelanders was a huge turning point. it was AMAZING and seeme dto be the game we always wished 76 was, then they just started burying us with more daily chores to "keep up". the daily wastelanders bullion/rep chore started burning me out really bad, and when legendary run was announced i just decided to skip it, not logging into 76 for weeks felt like such a relief. now im just going to wait until we get some sort of new content
---
just sucks to gets sucked back in with wastelanders only to have a really shitty follow up
---
\^ This. Great mini-guide to successfully completing the event.
---
I know a lot of people lost out on multiple days/weeks of progress. I hope Beth has some sort of something in mind to recoup the losses for them
---
What community did for you that make you still enjoy this game? and what you have done to keep the community going? What's the point keep it going if the game sounds like will not improve and very disconnected with gaming community?
---
Id rather not carry leechers asses, should be a lvl requirement for sure, or better, launch your own nuke, and then u can join any boss events
---
Thatd be way cool
---
Is this on console or pc?
---
Place down a door wall variant. Then place down a regular wall in the same spot but facing the other way. Youll see it snap in. Then replace the door variant to a regular wall.
---
You rock! Thank you kindly!
---
best solution is to take them out before they become a problem, easy XP too.. assuming you can keep ontop of them
---
The screws? They are from the wendigos. I got about 200 last run.
---
yep, awful lag. it wasn't fun.
---
No they weren't. Both pocketed and deep pocketed limbs were added on console only yesterday. Before that, only the torso had those two mods.
---
Just returned to the post only to see the title has “resplendent” instead of respond. I didn’t even know that was a word.
---
Until season 2 that is! I hope it gets mixed up a bit. Making all the score come from weeklies would be amazing and would definetly go a long way to not making it feel like a chore
---
Play on your private server then, if you dont want ppl at your sbq fight
---
Yeah and if you have any trouble with it I'm pretty sure youtube can show it. I understand it sounds a bit complicated when you read it
---
Lvl 75 wendigo is nothing to me, but the coloso is a pain in the butt
---
“I know man, I know.” David Thorpe, probably.
---
The timer is a nuisance when the event is ending and it puts me in a limbo state where I *cant* respawn, if there were no event death glitches I wouldn’t mind, but thanks to the shitty coding the respawn mechanics are weird, especially with long timers.
---
Yeah, generally speaking it's a cool design, but they need to revamp the post-kill hijinks a bit. 
---
Second time I ran this I was much better about positioning, etc. but when he dies off a ways, his body is quite small and there is so much junk / clutter / environmental that you can't easily find the body. The spawns continue, making it a pain to loot and you need to hasty-exit. If you die, the respawn mechanism near the end is rough and if you happen to not be in PA and it dumps you outside, welcome to the nuke-zone and possibility of being stuck in a respawn loop depending on your carry weight, etc.
---
And for a game about junk and scrap, the inability to look all those screws is just shameful ;-)
---
I’ve done more than enough PTS work and have come to the same conclusion that quite a lot of my counterparts who actually make videos of their experiences complain about. 
---
The original issue was this so called “balance” you’re arrogantly talking about as if you’ve talked to me before, 
---
1. Numbers across the board whether it be total or per second do both indicate overall damage
---
2. You’re now suggesting that I haven’t done work with PTS
---
3. You’re now calling everyone out as a cry baby who has an opinion.
---
4. Have you stated a single fact yet? 
---
5. Grow up.
---
Thank you. thats no problem. Ill just switch to the CSA.
---
I really dont like power armor is all. Most of my carry weight is attached to my armor pieces
---
I'm not sure how the instance works.  Someone launched it on a public server.  The event was still going on but the marker had disappeared.

I joined a public team of 3 (there was another public team of 4) that was already in the event and fast traveled to the leader.  Earl was at about 75% health and had already regenerated.  I then left the team of 3, started a new one, and then pulled in two other players.  So, it's at least 6 and, from what I read, it should be 8 per instance.
---
We were able to complete the event and get the rewards.
---
So, for those wondering, you can join the event once it's already started and the marker isn't showing, but only if there is a slot open on a team that has already entered.  Also, there is nothing stopping you from leaving that team, once you have entered, and starting a new one to get other players in.
---
Just make sure that you've talked to the woman in Foundation and have gotten the quest at least once.  I entered having not done this and didn't get any rewards at the end of my first time through.
---
1 thing that has helped my wife and I is to be on a team with each other before joining the event. 
---
The only time we weren't on a team we were in separate instances.
---
They are indupedly duped.
---
I was pretty upset when I noticed this! Not buying all since I’ve already bought one.
---
Wtf??? Why the hell should I have to PAY MONEY just to not have low level players screwing over the endgame event thats specifically meant for high level players?? This should be obvious...
---
Yaaaa I get that but its bethesda someone probably joined in
---
Unfortunately it makes bloodied still OP one shot machines for regular enemies. The other builds are rendered to painful grinding of bullet sponge enemies. Especially stealth rifleman and mele.
---
I understand the frustration and it sucks, but I am pretty sure exposing posts are not allowed?
---
I hate selfish people. Sorry bro that happen to you.
---
If the event is not going to be going so well I would focus on killing lvl 75 wendigo along with your team so that you can get ammo perified water, radaways, screws and fiber optics loots on the last 5 min on event,
---
Bosses are usually explosive-resistant, so explosives do little against them. However, an explosive weapon should be effective against the normal wendigos in the event. It might be better for you to focus on them instead of Earle, and protect your teammates so they can take him down.  
---
Also, explosive weapons generally break faster than others, so bring some repair kits with you or even a second weapon.
---
I'll save this for tomorrow and see if I can send you an invite.
---
It must take some skill, I had a gauss shotty in NW and still died lol. Thats why I am a bush wookie.
---
To be honest I use whatever I find in NW 😂
---
I do, as long as your fire rate is over 200 or explosive with a 110 fire rate. I tested my ultra gat vs my junkies ffr ultra gat (227 fire rate). I also ran this on private server for less lag :) not magic effects procced that I saw
---
Magic is also pretty useless for the colossus I'd reckon - the magic effect only triggers if you hit the same body part. That thing is very scrawny and very fast, you would have to get verrrry lucky to proc more than a couple of seconds of magic.
---
One thing I've noticed, (I've only done 4 ACP events so far) is that people let the wendigo spawns go rampant. 
---
I try to kill them all asap because they can stagger you and get you killed by falling debris or that orange acid the wendigo spits. 
---
Ita just not all about constant damage to the boss. Keep the arena clear of mobs and the whole group will have better survivability.
---
This happened to me twice today and I had to full close application 🤷🏽‍♂️ funny thing too I would get the green computer screen instead of the dull white version for a while after booting back in
---
It’s like any high level event, once you do it a handful of times and get comfortable with it, it’s not so overwhelming. I had the benefit of playing a bunch of times on the PTS and on PC release last week. 
---
I played with my regular crew on Xbox tonight and it was kind of funny as I was calm and cool, taking chunks out of Earle, stopping to murder his children and take their screws, taking a few more chunks out of Earle, strolling casually out of the mine as it collapsed—while my fiends were fleeing for their lives. 
---
By the time we all do it a half dozen times they’ll all be just fine. Enjoy the adrenaline rush while it lasts, that feeling is only there for so long before it becomes just another thing you know how to breeze through.
---
I don't get it. It wasn't nearly as bad as y'all make it out to be. I used about 1k ultracite 308, and like 5 super stims.
---
Log on to any other online game, then log on to 76. 
---
It's worked for me, it's worked for most of thr people I've told except the last guy.
---
Honestly having a medic in the party would go far.
---
gives u time to think about what you did and learn from it.  
---
you wanna be alive focus on that and adjust any strategy you were doing to account for the added 4 minutes of respawn time you want to avoid.
---
I'm used to multiplayer games where you're waiting two minutes minimum and sometimes close to an hour depending on the group or game.
---
I'm literally just like you, and was hoping to run a .50 cal rifle for end game. I didn't like the hunting rifle, but I grinded my way through the MQ using it.
---
This week I got an AA lever action and I love it for normal PVE stuff. It is way more satisfying to use. I think I would be better off with instigating, though.
---
I love how little ammo I need to roam the map, but I guess I'm not that much of an asset in boss fights.
---
It's from captain cosmos outfit from atom store
---
Sounds like a broken weapon, scrubs love abusing stuff like that
---
I’ll try that out
---
A great orator you are
---
I mean, all the screws are worth it...
---
P.s if you didn’t play bloodied build, you could survive mine collapse at the end. (8 End)
---
Reclaimed Mining Helmet from A Colossal Problem
---
That doesn't include the 7600hr challenge right??
---
Yeah the medics pump saved me several times from the environment during fears. To be honest though I was carrying so much ammo with the vamps weapons that my main enemy was the timer. I might break out my magic vamp mini next time XD
---
Gauss shotgun is ridiculously op in nw. A shotgun should not be ae to one tap u from so far away. I was one tapped once by someone way up on a cliff nowhere near me.
---
Gonna cry?
---
They do.  But you need to have them in spots where the spawns will notice them first.  
---
I put up a scarecrow for one of my previous camps because I had mole rats that would attack my crops.  They did go after the scarecrow first but it gets destroyed quickly.  
---
Basically, they buy you time to go out and kill the varmints before they can trash the rest of your CAMP, not much else.  I really wish that you could store rat poison in them which would then kill creatures attacking it.
---
Run explosive perks with it
---
Haha nicely done! :D damn it I might need to start playing around with bloodied build! ;)
---
People who perk out just to use it are what I'm referencing lol
---
I wasn’t keeping up with the news on the updates... and I’ve been wanting to raise my reputation with the foundation.
---
So I took that one quest, something sentimental and saw that the mines were in a blast zone, no biggie just hop into some power armor and make my way there. 
---
I find like 9 other people and think hey this will be fun. 
---
Then I jump down that damn mine shaft. 
---
I’d never faced a wendigo colossus before so I thought this would be like the scorchbeast Queen. Boy was I wrong. We all failed that event and I need ammo lol.
---
It's so skilled
---
Oh no you're 100% right I just find it baffling that so many corporate bootlickers love a game that is satirical towards Nationalism and Capitalism. Same fucking dipshits that were surprised Rage Against the Machine was Anarchist....
---
Theres a problem with colossal problem that actually causes game crashes. Happened to me as soon as me and my full team loaded into the mine, and I couldnt rejoin. Im gonna say 9 times out of 10 if one of your teammates randomly "leaves" the event without warning, they crashed.
---
My jet pack is a lifesaver at that event, otherwise I would be swarmed and dead in 10 seconds.
---
I always get killed by it and how do they jump so high
---
The first time I did It i ran out of ammo over all 4 weapons i had and had to pick up a shotgun off the mole miner corpses to keep fighting
---
He's partially right - requirements for magic on heavies is one of - junkies, stalkers, instigating, 33% vats hit chance, 50 limg dmg or bashing dmg on a 200+ fire rate weapon Or a 100 fire rate explosive
---
EXACTLY. I tried the PTS on my builds. 2/3 are gimped to irrelavancy. Only my heavy gunner came out as useable in it's current state. Bloodied is so OP half damage is still more powerful than my one shot lvl 68 mutant rifleman build.
---
Think I ran into him too... started attacking us all at the cookout. Just left him to it.
---
False. That's not how one wasteland works. Earle will certainly have a minimum level, which will likely not go below 50. If a level 25 goes in, he will see a lv 50 boss and wendigos.
---
Lmao so original you're really good at reddit
---
Good luck
---
FFXIV.
---
Frog legs and it take absolutely zero skill
---
“Can anybody hear me? I can’t really ever tell.”
---
Because there is no level cap, the boss lifepool should be adjusted as resultant of the levels of all participients.
---
The guys im playing with are almost completely beta players with a huge addiction to the fallout franchise. We're together for more then 1.5y now, know where everyone lives, how their realife is and so on - we call us friends.
---
The point of playing a game is to have fun, at least I assume it. But since wastelanders the game has one downstage after another, stuff like fast travel bug, respawnbug, freezes or all the other untouched bugs are killing it. Were now playing a different game, most didn't done the new event or just tested it out. Seeing what's up on the roadmap, what we got and how the publisher handles the game over the past 2 years now killed every hope.
---
As example, we are only provided with fetchquests, whole wasteland story was a fetchquest after another till the showdown which was lame aswell - fo4 let you blast the institute if you want, and even fo4 was known for a mediocre storry. The next thing is our grind, the carrots are not even in our view anymore. First grind bullions for weeks, then get the armor plans and grind for the preferred stats - it takes about 20-25k modules to get the set of your desire, that would take several century's claiming 3modules each day. Rep grind was also too much. Now the legenday perks were intended to reach a single character to level 3200 without wasting any level up tokens before they reduced it due the huge criticism.
---
Fallout76 were never intended to exist, its just a fallout4 multilayer mod they blown up to a full game within 1.5 years. Now they dont want people play for too long, since only new players are statistically paying enough.
---
Gauss shotgun is the equivalent to the Tesla rifle in adventure. Built for no talent pussies who can’t aim
---
Did you ever find out if it was still broken?
---
But for real, if it bothers you: Fireproof *exists*
---
Seriously, thank you for being so helpful! Nope, I "got" it, though I'm having trouble getting it to work for the part of the wall that connects with the roof—I think the wall arch. For now I've just faced that towards my interior house so my "secret" room is more believable.
---
I'll consult YouTube to see if there's anything to do about the wall arches!
---
Thanks and Same here bro. When people act like that then they should be called out for it and held to account
---
Yeah its really not funny with a bloodied melee builf tho I tell you that, especially when your gatling is a fuckin nocturnal and started at 12 midday in game😡
---
Bingo!!
---
I completely forgot about that quest, seems like it’s been years!! Oh wait.. it has :P 
---
I too enjoyed the quest line (: thanks for the nostalgia trip
---
I'm talking about NW you idiot
---
I still find it weird that my character is friends with a demolition expert at The Crater, but I still need to use a thermonuclear weapon to clear some rocks from the front of a mine...So I can recover an old pocketwatch.
---
Dont, your just be playing yourself. Its not that uncommon of a drop.
---
NW Fireproof *exists*
---
This is exactly what I named my TSE .50 machine gun.
---
They made a post talking about how they were reducing the dmg but were buffing it later on
---
You have clearly never played NW lmao
---
I'm roleplaying an evil clown. My favourite bit is eating corpses of mile miners while we wait for the rubble to clear. &lt;3
---
Damn, I totally forgot about that lol
---
I sure did, video proof even exists on YouTube
---
But you’re right, NW Fireproof doesn’t exist. You’re right. I always assumed it existed
---
Heavy guns are still viable, it's the weak stuff like semi auto rifles, pistols, bows and single handed mele that became irrelevant with the nerf.
---
He isnt really that hard. Cripple his legs and he's gonna be a easy target. Those wendigo spawns can be annoying if you dont take care of them early on. And be careful and stay away from those Dot areas and places where stuff falls from the ceiling.
---
Tried exacrly that, it wouldnt work. Just spawned me in the nuke zone and I couldnt re enter the mine.
---
Thank you, that’s comforting to know. After my initial experience I dwindled in horror but per any PTS it’s literally there to test the waters. 
---
This makes FlippinChips a happy Enclave Soldier, GOD BLESS AMERICA!!
---
Maybe it was a bug and they fixed it. Always thought mine was a bit high.
---
OOF I’d say my friends got a BFFR plasma he can sell you but you’re PS4 :/
---
*stares in brotherhood*
---
It’s 8 players per instance but it reserves space within the instance for teammates. So even though there were 6 there, the other spaces were likely taken. So you got a new instance. I don’t understand the 8 person limit, I assume it’s performance related, but that’s the explanation.
---
Play stealth anything not bloodied and feel the pain.
---
He's easier than the SBQ because you don't have a bunch of players running around with pistols and single shot rifles...
---
What it needs is a real dungeon crawl where you have to solve riddles, pick locks, hack terminals, get through laser grids, drop down levels, swim through a maze with chances of drowning, etc. with a random boss at the end.
---
Have sections where you need to use different weapons to progress (i.e. a shovel or a pickaxe).  More of a adventure and less shooting.
---
Definitely should be some survivor who wasn't killed off who comes back to the manor. 
---
Maybe the whole "danger room" area that was either cut or just never finished could finally be operational? 
---
I'm not sure that if the MoM comes back that they'd be too happy if you were allied with Crater. After all, technically they are the last remnants of the raiders that were the MoM enemy.
---
First try: Infinite loading screen while exiting the mine.
---
Launched a nuke on the mine: 10 seconds before impact = disconnected from server
---
Ugh. It's hard to love this game sometimes.
---
If you use the flame thrower trick you can use flat roofs to create a flat ceiling so the wall arches arent visible from the inside
---
Maybe I wouldn't sound arrogant if you just stop to whine for a single second and use your brain once.
---
How to explain it for dummies? You know world of warcraft? They are doing the same each two years. They reduce the numbers, nerfing everything. Also the enemys. Ever checked how much hp a supernatant or anything else had on pts? Ever checked the ttk (time to kill)? 
---
No, you just see low numbers on your weapon and forget that one wastelanders is exactly what bethesda announced, but instead you just cry and don't think. 
---
Just wait till the release get live, or whine at the official forum if you want to keep ramboing like with godmode oneshotting everything while crying the queen gets killed within 2sec. We are too strong now anyway and the "nerf" also affects all enemys.
---
Hahaha wow, you played a lock in tbc and reckon your rotation was hard? Oh my sweet summer child. 
---
You seem to be under the delusion that I'm defending this - I'm really not. I'm just saying that's the way it is  - it's not fanboying, it's being a realist. Bitching about it on a forum about it does absolutely nothing but make you look naive. My entire point through these posts is that this is the gaming model that is being used by many people, if you don't like it don't fucking play, simple as :) 
---
This is the world we live in now. Wow does it, SWTOR does it, every mmo does it. Maybe its time you stopped living in the glorious golden days and either stop bitching or stop playing a game you disagree with.
---
Also, EQ player here too, not a mobile ptw kid. EQ, DAOC, RS, all the early mmos. I just accept that things change.
---
Literally git gud
---
Eh, he wasn't too bad. I tanked him with my melee build too for most if the fight. Decent armor, a single point in Serendipity,  and 2 points in born survivor.  Don't get me wrong, he hits like a truck. Kicks me for about 50% health, and his fear saved my ass a few times as running away let the Stimpack heal me. Never died, and was still running around pulling Wendigos off my teammates. Burned about 30 normal stims too. It was tons of fun.
---
I couldn't agree more! I don't understand why they couldn't use eso example. Sending emails, and using emails for trades or just being able to messege someone through world chat would make it way easier to communicate!
---
Ah well thanks for offering anyway dude
---
Listen mate you’re clearly a man-baby so I’ll put it plain and simple for you.
---
You’re a big, stinky Poo poo. 
---
That’s about the level of conversation you deserve. 
---
So I’ll leave you at that.
---
That's how I operate
---
Is this statement directed at the current game or the PTS update--or even both?
---
You are describing my playstyle and gripes to a tee. Kudos!
---
You should try joining discord groups. As far as I know, in-game communication is bad by itself.
---
Bro, you don’t need to tell stories. Nobody expects you and your level 39 brother to beat him. And we KNOW you didn’t do it with 10 minutes to spare just the two of you. It’s ok man everyone wants to fit in sometimes.
---
Thats your only reply, calling me a baby where you are the one who is complaining he would be sad if he can't one-shot everything anymore? How pathetic.
---
But I can't let go of my trusty TS lever.. 😞
---
I read a different thread somewhere in here about a bug that had popped up... Apparently the fix involved removing the core from the frame and dropping the cores ininventory, then picking up again and re-entering frame, forcing the animation to insert a new core. Or something to that effect.
---
Luckily the damage nerf will make single shot rifles even worse.  Thanks goodness.
---
Really hate it, the rallypoint of scorched earth also pain like hell, it's the main source of the random team/friend invites, and also makes you harder to join when you are already late, worst QoL since day one
---
Or plasma cores?
---
Game is straight dogchit
---
Did it by myself with 16 minutes to spare on the next attempt, so apparently Earl isn’t that difficult... No need to be a prick.
---
It took me nine tries to get Unyielding SS right arm. Six rolls for left arm. Can't remember how many for Chest but I did have to scrap a lot of chests and wait a day to get more modules.
---
I was vampire build, but they nerfed vampire's. Became stealth sniper they nerfed stealth in PTS.... It's meta or nothing now.
---
I don’t think so. He doesn’t appear to get slowed either by cryo grenades or weapons.
---
Yeah, as the other reply mentioned, that is a myth. It's been datamined all the way back to BETA. She never scaled.
---
Yes it can
---
I always thought mine was low
---
You did not lol but ok. I’m not being a prick I’m letting you know that lying on Reddit isn’t necessary.
---
Then I guess we're all fucked then. Thanks for the reply c:
---
The only thing it will do is drop damage across the board.  That's all the "rebalance" does.
---
I wish I could do it. Finally got sick of waiting on Beth and just glitched into the elevator. 
---
Once up top you can register with the computer there and you (apparently) no longer need the ID

After whats in the PTS is done.
---
You know i’d actually love to have a conversation with you about the subject but the fact of the matter is you’re the one who came rushing in calling out all the “whiners” like some kind of Demi-god. 
---
Arrogantly speaking to me as if I should know exactly what you’ve said in life, where you’ve said it. 
---
You must be at most 16 years of age.
---
If you’d like to actually talk about the facts I’m more than happy to. 
---
And I’m not going to get personal about it like you’ve started off doing. 
---
You’ve now implied I’m dumb, I’m a cry baby, chances are you’re going to take it further so I really need to ask...
---
Is everything okay in life?
---
Did you have a bad day?
---
I’m honestly concerned at this point. 
---
If you’re going to speak to me as if you’re above me you can honestly just go suck a big old banana. 
---
If you’re going to talk to me respectfully then I will speak to you respectively.
---
I have nothing against you, but you sure as heck have something against me and others who offer suggestions.
---
You sure? Someone just replied saying it doesn't. I'm talking about Earl Williams, the boss fight.
---
People can use whatever they want in all honesty. I mean, there is no clear spawn for it. Considering you can find it in that one game, why not abuse it? You could say, people who collect nuclear key cards and nuke the small are at the end cannot fight and only want an easy way out all the same. Or the fish people who get the card to breathe under water and lay low entire game are good for nothing. If you find a way to win, then go for it. As long as you're not hacking, I honestly couldn't care less. And neither should you. 🤔
---
I appreciate this info. I guess I have been believing a lie this whole time.
---
It just works!
---
Just make head shots with rifflennperk double
---
Dam
---
Just sit there and let them do the work.
---
I went in with 12k Ultracite 2mm and left with 8k. So I used about 4k rounds of ammo
---
It doesn't stop it moving, but it does slow it down
---
One Appalachia isn't a re-balance, it just levels monsters to your level, if that's what you mean.  I've heard of no weapon rebalance in the works, correct me if I'm wrong.
---
The heads regenerate after I believe 45 seconds.
---
Tried that. Unless they buff the base damage A LOT pistols are even worse gimped than now.
---
Ahh thanks :D !
---
I heard about it, a long time ago. Not with one Appalachia, but there was some kind of mention of grand rebalancing. Not that they ever gave a time, so...
---
With what they did with damage calculation in the PTS, it’ll at least be easier to balance stuff.
---
said the same thing in a different way and can't find my post gone like a fart in the wind
---
I had the issue before going bloodied but it’s may still be related to “taking damage”
---
Another thing to note is that the queen being killed in two seconds is not a bloodied builds doing. 
---
The queen being killed in two seconds is due to scripters adding in things like “glitched weapons”
---
Ever seen a two shot 50 cal explosive that actually fires around 40 rounds with a single pull of the trigger? 
---
Those are the kinds of weapons that kill SBQ in two seconds.
---
Actually, a nimble level 30 can attract most of the wendigo, leaving Earle to the others, saw this at one fight. There was this lv 25 running in a circle around the are with easily some 30 wendigo spawns running after him. Good times.
---
I got the plushie on my first try. What other rewards are there?
---
I'm sorry to hear that.
---
The reason to do rifleman isn't damage its weapon variety since the laser and plasma weapons get flamer and semi auto variants.
---
The automatic versions of them suck and have massive recoil. They also have a stupid cheap bolt action rifle that's uses 5mm, mini gun ammo.
---
Outside that there is the guass rifle although hard to use has the highest single shot damage in the game and the lever action rifle has a silencer making you a deadly assassin, even without the stealth bonus.
---
This 1000%. I’ve played and beat it twice and both times toward the middle till the end of the fight it got so laggy and pixelated it was like an NES game and playing on slow dial up. One time he fell through the floor for 5 minutes and came out of the ceiling then fell through the floor again over and over. The event was fun the bugs are not.
---
I am nearly level 500 &amp; I had 7 others under level 80 join.
---
We failed, but I did get 160 screws :)
---
Why would you revive another player at that event? Just respawn, is not like it takes you far or you lose control of a pylon...
---
I do agree to some sort of lvl restriction, make it a delux endgame event,  like you have to be at least 50 to get in. Gives a low level player the motivation to level up.
---
Okay first of all, [I’ve beaten the scorched beast queen solo before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hhv4mu/after_1600_hours_in_fallout_76_i_finally_managed/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) And she was much more difficult than Earl. 
---
Second of all, [Suck it.](https://imgur.com/a/l8SZp4Y) Not another dammed soul in that mine with me. So take your disbelief elsewhere. Have a good day.
---
You are welcome :)
---
I'd love to get to that trunk but so far I've died 3/3 times trying to get there :/ I got killed by either rocks falling from the ceiling or some random wenigos only targeting me and hunting me down... got a cursed weapon once tho which is weird considering I never got to the trunk with the cursed weapons
---
They still drop but they nerfed it so it isn't op anymore. I would keep it people still want them. 550 hours still dont have a tse anything and I love my explosive guns
---
OK so as a Guy triggered me on Angry Turtle post about duping items saying that I was stupid to trade a legit legacy for another legacy I need because if the risk of the legacy to be duped. I went to his youtube video and discovered that the Guy had 6 full sets of SSA, all with a different main prefixe and all with AP refresh and either sentinel or WWR or HTD. Plus obviously Legacy bloodied Flamer, cryo and Laser Rifle
---
I quickly did the math and even though is started banking up modules from day 1, 4 and 1/2 a day in average (average scrip you can get daily is around 250 from dailies) you still need to ve REALLY Lucky to get 30 pièces of God Roll armor.
---
My suspicion went even higher yesterday when I saw a level 1 Guy (called OnlyToddCanJudgeMe)with SSA chest, 2 arms and underarmor. the fact is that you cant start the gold bullion quest before level 20.
---
So I did some researches and discovered 1) SSA Uny AP Sentinel full set on ebay and 2) duping method videos 3 weeks old allowing to dupe SSA on youtube.
---
So its pretty clear that a wave is going on and it has to be hacked items in the first place because you can putt them in containers and on too low character (tried this morning cant putt any legit gold bullion items in my collectron station, they dont even appear in the inventory)
---
No...... Way.....
---
I'm working my way through it now, since 'Ounce of Prevention' has been broken. It is a lot of fun. I'm finding the mistresse's bodies in more places then I thought.
---
You revive people because they take longer and longer to respawn every time. Once everybody takes too long to respawn, it’s just a bunch of Wendigo Spawns jumping me while I try and kill them all instead of fighting the boss, and no damage gets done.
---
Yet Base is here, hints for automatic system, etc. They literaly can grow things around, like you upgraded/restored server, dailys and events.
---
She needs to teach Murmrgh how it's done....
---
I freaked out when I got it. That was the last thing I expected from a quest reward.
---
I love executioner's weapons. I'd have bought you out if they were heavy guns or auto rifles.

I dishonored my cow by selling the plan for a lot of caps to a player with a much higher level (300 plus) than me (lvl20).
---
Yeah.   If you get in there and see that the makeup of the group is something like that, just leave.   Gather flux.   It's not a rich area by any means in terms of HRF, but I could make two stable crimson flux from it.

Completely depleting assets for any of the rewards available probably isn't worth it...especially if the deck is stacked against you and you won't even be getting those.

Oh c'mon, now you are really starting to get pathetic. I'm 4y on reddit, how could I be 16? I don't think you are concerned, now stop lying and act like an adult since you argue to like talking like one.

I have something against idiots who have no idea how the game works or what bethesda want it to be. Fallout76 is not a typical commercial game, its a testground for upcomming prestige projects. I like constructive posts about changes and suggestions, but posting shit about totally stupid or ignorant personal wishes without thinking about any other player is not worth to be taken serious. Your post is one of 100 the last few days, every single one is just "uh numbers are going down I'm sad Beth plz stop or ill quit" bullshit. What's your suggestion to change or do you want things to go on like now? What is your intention to post this while so much others already did better before you? And why can't you stand criticism?
---
I play as a medic and I often go through well over 40 stimpaks healing and reviving others
---
Exactly what you have and i went for Psycho for 2 reasons: 1, I'd rather have the extra 5lbs of carry weight and 2, I plan on using psycho as my main combat chem over med-x. (I'm a Empath for team support)
---
I’ve done 4 of the events now and only made one haha. Everybody just leaves when it gets hard or a bunch of level 30’s infest the area. I just want my damn Reclaimed Gas Mask.
---
I'm level 50 and I really just act as bait for the windigos spawn and show people the way out
---
Thanks!
---
I originally found the garb or whatever at like level 5, it sat in my inventory until I was about level 310 before I finally did anything about it. I don't know why I put it off for so long, it's so far been my favourite questline haha.
---
Let’s be real.
---
You’re sitting here misspelling, using the wrong grammar, and saying that I’m uneducated?
---
I’m done with this conversation I have no time for it.
---
Unlike you I don’t thrive off of conflict. 
---
Goodbye.
---
Low levels really need to have some sort of starter boss event, like a colossus type event for level 25 players that is easily soloed by high levels, but manageable for low level players to give them a place to experiment and get used to the tempo of these big hard hitting boss enemies without being completely useless.
---
You just get to the end of the story, fight the boss scorchbeast at the end of glassed caverns with it's 4k hp and then it's off to fight the next boss, a 32k, 90% damage mitigating, legendary that completely and utterly eclipses all other enemy types in the game by such a wide margin it's unmanageable. 
---
Something which is obviously a group event boss, but is also feasible to do with early game weapons.
---
Explosive energy weapons don't drop any more... TSE ballistics still do, and they are good. They haven't been the meta in quite some time, but they are still good weapons so long as you're spec'd into them (the damage cards for the specific weapon plus demo expert). I wouldn't drastically alter your build to make it your main weapon, but if you can port it to a different character it's more suited for, or work it in as a backup for your main I say work with it. If you don't want to do either of those things you can seek a buyer for it. It'll net you a good amount of caps at the very least, or potentially a trade for some other good but not meta weapon you want.
---
Especially on certain weapons.  TSE gauss rifle for example, legacy, but still very strong.
---
No hack/glitch weapon does it that fast. The .50 is also be with an beamsplitter instead of the handle.
---
Limb damage, bashing damage and armor with less blocking damage is bugged. They are called magic weapons. 
---
Another sign you have no idea.
---
Me too my friend! I so excited with this event 😊😊😊
---
I don’t think CRYPTOS is an intelligent system, it’s more like an advanced database. It’s not like MODUS, it just does what it’s programmed (it can greet you, but it never speaks otherwise, nor does it display any signs of intelligence or awareness, just dispensing holotape. It doesn’t even promote you, since you have to log in to other accounts to promote yourself.). So it would probably send you to the old Raider bases, where Rose is, if anything.
---
Even without live npc, there are hints/mentions about upgrade for server, automatic thingy. So they just need do the thing %)
---
Will this kind of issue be sorted naturally with the upcoming One Wasteland update?
---
Wow - that's impressive. And I thought \*I\* had a magic gun or two. My "Magic" Gauss Minigun just nibbles away at old Earle. I guess there's magic and there's \*Magic\*.
---
Thanks for the science experiment.
---
Its too bad The description in atomic shop is so misleading, I was hoping otherwise
---
Yeah, probably due to one wasteland. Like to nerf it is a controversial move in my opinion but I don't want to be biased but making one if not the most popular build useless is just a trashy move, like they have either grinded for their gear and to make a strong build and traded alot just for them to make their build not nearly as effective
---
It is yes, having no in-game chat is pretty bad
---
Good luck finding the level 30 that does this, and it won’t matter if nobody is doing damage to the boss.
---
If you can spare the weight and want the better lore wise addiction Med-X is safer than Psycho (see Fo4 Cait).
---
Psycho also lets you use Psychobuff and Psychotats without risking addiction tho, I run r2 Chem Resistant to use any chem I want.
---
—close
---
Thanks very much. Might do a giveaway on Friday so look out for it :)
---
The fight wasn't that hard for my teams the two times I did it. My trouble was more finding Earle's body and then gettign away in time. I had fast travel both times which does get you out of the mine, but seems to screw you out of completing the event properly so I got no drops beyond what was on Earle's body
---
Stay strong Corn Soup brother.
---
Y goodbye, have fun whining :)
---
Use a Telsa fr
---
The other day I saw someone on here raise a statement that all high levels melt through enemies on "Prime Meat" without sharing. As they also want xp and rewards. I get it. But that's what SBQ is for, that's what smaller events that impact the event by simply collecting or slamming a barrel is for. If we, as higher level players have responsibility to share, then they have responsibility to learn boundaries. Seeing a level 20 guy coming to do colossal problem, then upon being downed like 10 times and someone from the team having to run to stimpack them or them simply going afk for the rewards because they die a lot anyways makes you as a newbie player look like a bigger douche bag than higher level trying to finish off enemies quick to get the event to complete and obtain the rewards. But no. It's always the higher levels that are stealing all the xp and hoarding all the legendaries. 😒
---
Not all heroes wears a cape
---
No no no no. I just tried my instigating crossbow in PTS. I went from 1 shot to 3 - 4. Stealth is negated due to multiple shots being required. Stealth is buggy enough already and taking it away completely destroyed the crossbow.
---
Are health pools for enemies also being tweaked?
---
If they get killed so aften then is not worth to revive them, they are not equipped for the boss fight.
---
It might or it might not. I have no idea
---
The colloses pronlem event....😂😂😂
---
Sorry, SS Camo Underarmor...
---
damn I can’t even make her give me dailies
---
Unless you use stealth on your build. I managed to kill him alone and farm screws in the process. It was hard but neither him or the spawns could see me, so health was not a problem.
---
Pc sorry!
---
I just want my Reclaimed Gas Mask 😂😅
---
I barely made it with a crew of two others and a one-star bloodied fixer.  But died before I got out of the cave.  Still got a cursed pickaxe.
---
In all honesty if I see someone trying to talk to me or just using open world chat, I avoid them like plague. I think it's pretty awkward. 😅 We don't have world chat, so it's better to join a discord group and make friends/chat there.
---
Aren't most events already free to travel to? You can also use the friend's list menu to fast travel to them instead of the map.
---
Aw I feared that was the case since you mentioned you've already done it around 2 dozen times. I've only had the opportunity to do it twice. I appreciate it
---
Oh you’ve soloed the scorch beast queen? Well I didn’t know that. That’s a horse of a different color. Lol I’ve soloed him too. So have half the people I know. It’s not difficult. But listen if it makes you feel better to say this shit then go ahead bro. I was just trying to let you know you didn’t have to. Nobody to impress here.
---
Formula P
---
i would not call them mini-wendigo ... they are real wendigo at lvl 75 and they hit like a truck if you are not prepared  
---
i wear a protocol-ed ultracite and i am fine. from my point of view, if you can help cleaning these pest, you are strong enough to be in this "raid" if not, please accept that you will be like a boulder to your team-mate  
---
i am fine with helping low level player, selling plans for low caps, giving away free set of armor and armor to very low level player but please, do not join THIS event thinking you can just get the spoil, you will not have a good time, neither will your team-mate
---
He meant the bullion items, it's like quest items, when you trying to drop you will get a message that it will destroy instead of drop y/n. Which is the reason you will never seeing these items as a loot
---
As a lvl 20 player, Ill make sure I stay far way. Thanks for the info.
---
Bethesda fixes double sided ~~wallet~~ walls.
---
So what's best for a stealth character? Weightless. Or chameleon?
---
Level 25 here. I did it once just to see it. Never went down, granted I hod most of the time. I did revive people a few times. We beat the event. Almost died a few times on the way out though. I was out of stimpacks then had to heal with water 😅
---
\*attempt to change your mind\* Bethesda tried to solve an issue where walls were causing problems, this resulted in people not being able to place double walls and everyone was mad about it. They reverted the change because there wasn't an easy way to find the solution without harming builders.
---
Apply this logic to your specific request about one backpack skin.
---
So, what do you want it to do.
---
Instantly spawn you by the bonus chest at the exit, so the tactic is to loot things then run into the drill, negating the escape.
---
Respawn you in the fight area 60 seconds later, so you have no chance to even get to the end loot area.
---
Respawning the player outside if they die during the escape the mine portion is the least terrible option really. I don't mind the whole losing out on loot if you die.
---
They should definitely tone down the number of instant death traps that are active when the boss dies and give a grace period of two seconds where you can't die and skip the bleed out stage.
---
Yes ofc, since the levels are tweaked.
---
On pts the ttk for my lvl 1015char is just slightly increased, from oneshot to two shots while the first projectile reduces the health for about 80-90%.
---
Maybe after they make a proper world chat. Can't say it would be fun attempting to sign language a dungeon that may actually have a strategy other than take out your minigun and shoot at bigger target.
---
I’m not entirely sure Vector, my testing was the initial trials alongside a bunch of the you tubers and I was struggling to kill single supermutants with full clips from energy weapons (I personally love laser rifles and plasma weapons) 
---
I only base my opinion on the fact that whilst using mid grade laser rifles it at times was taking more than an entire clip to down a single super mutant (granted the mutant was higher than level 60) 
---
But that’s what my reflection is based off, and my suggestions go towards. 
---
I’ve been told by another kind soul that the initial damage nerf was for PTS only purposes to figure out a nice middle ground for others which I’m more than happy to find out. 
---
I just thought to voice my opinion and see what others think
---
You definitely don’t need 8 people. It can be done solo, plenty of YouTube videos to confirm this.
---
I miss my lever actions, had a nice TSE, JE, and J2515 set I would mash mutants with. I switched weeks ago and it's a massive upgrade
---
No. You collect the 8 code pieces and then you get the key from Mama Dolce’s. You also need the code word from the enclave bunker. There are 3 code words, one for each silo. There are tutorials on YouTube on how to decode the launch code. It’s a replacement alphabet code. Honestly, after you decode the first one by hand, usually for the sake of saying you did it, just use Nukacrypt. It’s not worth doing every time you want to launch a nuke.
---
Same. And also I tried bloodied. I feel like a god now.
---
What kind of gun was it
---
I guess you gotta know all the meds and mutations and got to be really careful with what you consume making sure you don’t get damage resistance, I think if you have a full lvl 1 Leather armor with shadowed it won’t affect ur damage but I’ve tried to be beserkers and it’s really hard to maintain.
---
Ts2590 fixer.
---
If you dropped something that cant be dropped before it, like gnasher or freezer grenades then that prevents the spawn, weapon is lost I'm afriad
---
Finally did get the non-reply from Bethesda.  Interestingly they suggested that my missing item might be a plan.  Really? My 3* Vampire's Tesla that I'd been using for months was a plan?  Well let me just make a new one...
---
It didn't have a skin. It was just a fixer. It didn't give me the heads up it was going to be deleted
---
As the nerfs affect all damage multiplications the damage/dps rankings have not changed. Bloodied is still the best followed by junkies.
---
Personally, I don't think your, as you, whining at all. As a low level player myself I would never enter an event and expect a higher level player to carry me. I'm smart enough to realize that as a low level player there are certain things I cannot do.
---
Yeah found that out today. First time playing since January, level 39. Heard about the new event, saw the new event in game, so I decided to join with my single fire handmade, 10 stimpacks, and 3 plasma grenades. Ended up being me, a level 25, and the guy who started it, a level 223. All my stims, ammo, and chems were gone in 10 minutes, level 25 left after dying a couple of times in the first minutes, and I had no choice but to leave the 223 by himself while the boss still had like 99% of his health. He ended up leaving the server completely after a while.
---
FR FFS!!!  Event had me bout to rage quit. The respawn times AND rushing us out after event or insta killing in some way. 🤬
---
Me too bro, I've been doing this event several times a day with no luck. 
---
I enjoy the event regadless of the outcome, so I can't complaint.
---
I'm bloodied stealth commando, I die at least once during the events and I don't let anyone waste stimpacks to revive me, is not worth it.
---
Those spawns are a major appeal to even do the event. Screws and acid for free. Idk what level you are but at some point you need hella acid to smelt ores in order to produce ammo. And if you have problems with them take a tesla rifle and kill'em
---
No, not a skin, spamming drop on those grenades often jumps to a weapon afterwards, if that is dropped this happens.
---
A high frame rate, excuse me? People get an advantage in this game by upping the frame rate?
---
I cant say i have..I've only found one other one and i just learned a mod from it. Tbh I've never seen another gauss weapon unless i said screw it because at the time i had a "better" gun.
---
Is the rifle the only vanilla gauss weapon?
---
Melee and ranged are different choices at the purveyor
---
Do you know the most powerful bloodied build atm? Im guessing heavy, melee or commando right?
---
No. TSE (both two shot and explosive effects) got massive nerf early 2019 and are now one of the worst effect combos you can get.
---
Ah, Sorry, misread that. Well, fuck. There goes a 3 star fixer.
---
Damn lvl 770, that's impressive.
---
What you like up your hill is your own business
---
I dropped my first nuke on it In the wrong place. I didn’t have map marker for the mine, so had put down a marker on the map. Unfortunately my public teammate also had a marker down somewhere else and I nuked it by accident. So that was fun.
---
I put up my tent right by the mine so I can travel to my tent instead of the event itself
---
Facebook group unstoppable couriers could help you for free. (You should tip them)
---
Create 4 more characters and put 1/4 of the presents on each.
---
Whatever you do DO NOT sell or delete the named items! You will not be able to replace them.
---
Shit design, be very careful dropping those grenades :-)
---
I don’t think most people “leave” they basically crash, happened to me earlier, blue screened mid fight and couldn’t join back!
---
They need to rip the band-aid and get rid of freaking Legendary weapons. They're broken as hell and no amount of nerfing is going to fix that.  
---
They need to make enemies having more precise weaknesses and also make it so weapons don't so such a stupid amount of damage regardless of enemy type.  
---
I haven't had this problem with the Colossus but I have only done it a handful of times. Just like with the SBQ I get pissed when it gets downed in a few seconds because it's not even about skill at all but just knowing how to play the game 'right'
---
Thats why I allways Radaway + Super stim in the end
---
Who cares if a weapon one shots something?
---
This appears to now be fixed. I had the same problem and following an update I downloaded yesterday, I was able to complete the mission.
---
hmm will have to try that the next time, I was only looking for the event icon on the map
---
If you want to be tanky, heavy with PA and emergency protocols
---
Op
---
Go Berserk. The damage rebalance will barely effect you
---
Cant loose junk anymore in world events
---
Invest in a fast firing vampires weapon.  It'll heal you while the enemy dies.  I have a 1* vampires mini and i never die as long as i have ammo.  But maaaaan it burns through ammo
---
If I want only dps would you say commando?
---
All I can say is that the wendigo spawns are good for building up adrenaline.
---
I'm gonna assume you never win
---
You have a very good point! But at least let me dream!
---
My TSE minigun melts Earle in about 7 seconds flat solo, so not terrible, but that's due to magic effect soon to be patched, already is in PTS
---
I might have to try that then
---
Farm purified water, clean places filled with supermutants and sell their weapons.... or buy a serum recipe, make serums and sell for 500 each to the vendor
---
These things you are talking about would probably be best making 556 or 45, at 1 cap each you should be able to sell it rather quickly.
---
5.56
---
&gt;TSE ballistics still do, and they are good
---
Dude, almost any other prefix is better... It is far from good. Only something like mutants or nocturnal are worse. Why is it that everytime i see you comment something is complete bullshit?
---
Keep lvling a bit more and you will find them on enemies
---
It can be crippled. It can’t sprint across the cave as much if you cripple the legs. It won’t use its screech (scare you away) as much if you cripple it’s head. But it can heal it’s crippled status though.
---
Same here.
---
Scorched WILLL Attack Grahm
---
The fact that anyone can do endgame bosses solo should be a critique in and of itself.
---
F to him lol
---
What platform you on?
---
Like i said nothing has changed. Only the amount of damage has dropped on everything.
---
Oh alright
---
Interesting in the mask on PC :)
---
Lazy way, try them with the Chinese stealth suit . Like the dmg output? max out with low lvl legendary armor. Miner event was q goldmine for it.
---
I'm gonna assume you cannot accept getting killed by someone and just being salty for no reason. Don't take it out on me, that's a YOU problem. I'm just trying to make a point. 😒
---
Betthats konda what I was thinking. I feel bad charging for 556, idk why, i guess cuz i use it so much so ill prolly just put in the vendor for free. The only thing I ask is if ya come across my camp and get some dont kill my Brahmin lol
---
You are an absolute moron. Thats all I can say after reading everything you've said.
---
You can, and if you cripple the Legs he stops moving around.
---
I have no such weakness *loads shotgun that one shots yao guai*
---
Bet, it may seem weird but ill prolly charge for 45 but let the 566 be free as a small thanks to the community
---
If you want to limit any event to players you deemed fit do it on a private server or just deal with it .
---
I agree. I'm level 110 and have all my strength/melee maxed out with an excellent hammer, and yet my strikes only did about 20 damage per hit. Plus with all the regular wendigos running around, lower level people just don't stand a chance and tend to bring the overall performance down.
---
Simp
---
Just read the poster in front of The Rusty Pick (where the Purveyor is) to begin the quest.
---
The PA's awesome. It provides a little less protection than some other PAs but it gives you an extra 100lbs carry weight (whole set required) over all others and 4x ore (both arms required) from mining.
---
The way this event  chews through resources, they may have simply ran out of supplies.
---
Ps4 🙃
---
When you're level 45 you should be able to get handmade rifles which are basically the best auto rifles in the game. And if you are on ps4 I could craft you a level 20 handmade and upgrade it for ya
---
Fallout 3 must have been a bitch. Staying between good and bad...
---
There's your problem. ;)
---
Make purified water by the boatload and sell it at the Wayward. Just load your ass uo and then server hop and do it again
---
Yeah, I've had that on my non-bloodied build just from being a little bit hungry. Not enough to start losing Health, but for some reason it was registering that I was. As soon as I ate something I was fine.
---
Oh that's a good one! 😮 Tell that to the guy who shot you to death and made you make this post.
---
All theyve done is add more cards and make it cheaper while also making you have to scrap even more cards. They havent addressed at all that there needs to be another source of coins
---
Grahm plushie that does a burp when you push it. I swear, every time I hear him burp, I laugh 😂
---
I actually just started switching, I need 1 more expert commando perk and I’m excited to see the difference. 
---
I think semi auto rifles need a buff on their fire rate cap, because they have a very inconsistent cap currently and it isn’t even a solid *bam, bam, bam* it’s more like *Bam...... Bam Bam*
---
You have to finish her quest line
---
We should send this to Bethesda. I am not sure if they will see it in here. It's a high priority exploit and they should be aware about that.
---
Ps4!
---
The cursed weapons are a reward now, not in the trunk anyway, its normal. Where you spawn before the drop you can still get to the crate. Just a pile of caps on ore in there now.
---
I am on ps4, that would be super helpful!
---
I have seen the duelweld thing floating about and it can work as a relatively new fallout 4 mode proves but we will have to see.
---
Pistols work okay right now since the vats cost is so low but the synergy needs to be more tight. An easy fix is to give pistols some sort of vats critical refund/regen if they stay in vats the whole time.
---
If you're already built for heavy weapons, then I'd say it's just a matter of getting batteries included, power user, and stabilized. Gatling lasers will start competing for cores with your pa. Calibrated shocks and emergency protocols are your friends.
---
Ok
---
I had read the bloodied numbers were affected most in terms of percentage reduction (e.g. 40-70% depending on the weapons). Is that not the case?
---
Unfortunately i got 4 Cursed Harpoons..... on the Brightside I got the 2 things I wanted the plushie and pickaxe as for the rest idc including the miner helmet ill get the rest eventually it is a permanent event so no need to rush for the rewards... 3* guranteed weapons/armor are a good incentive too
---
Nuke the mine and find out....
---
Yes it has.
---
The water suggestions are solid, and so's the advice to sell serums; but as a middleground if you can find a Marine Wetsuit Helmet plan each can sell for around 30 caps for a piece of glass, plastic, and a few bits of rubber (the Treasure Hunter Hat plan works too, about 25 caps for something made of cloth and oil, but is much rarer)
---
a cursory search of this subreddit would say yes. c'mon bruh I don't even play on console and I knew that
---
About that screech. I don’t know why but my char always runs towards earl and not away like it’s supposed to be
---
This is a great idea. So much flavor. Extra base carry weight is genius.
---
That is beyond stupid. Especially since there is actually an event that kills you for staying in the exact same way.
---
How about you give players a little credit, Bethesda. Stop holding everyone's hand. If you decide to hang around in a collapsing mine, maybe you deserve to deal with the consequences.
---
Oh i dont use Gat Laser, i use a BE 50 cal :)
---
Gotta level up mate.
---
While I wouldn't say they're the best, they're not the worst. I've got a TSE HM &amp; Lever from way back &amp; while the accuracy is less than desirable, if you can find the sweet spot between hurting yourself from the splash but being close enough both rounds hit they are certainly viable for most PvE.
---
I keep both of those on display most the time but I'll pull em down every now &amp; then I guess out of nostalgia.
---
Must remember that not every single person is min-max'ing &amp; going for ultimate. If I had a new toon that got a TSE I'd certainly use it until I found something that edged it out.
---
I can give you some weapons, what do you want?
---
1. Craft ammo and sell it. You can find videos about farming lead (lucky hole mine) or steel (just scrap weapons from scorched/mutants) or acid (mobs). Then craft thousands of .45 and 5.56 ammo and put it on sale, they'll be gone in a day. Also 5mm and .50cal are selling good. If you have loads of these and they do not sell, add .308 and shotgun shells. Sell 1 caps/ammo, not more. Ammo sells well if you have like 20k ammo at your shop.
---
2. Do events like queen and especially colossus. Colossus can yield up to 1k caps in drop. You can sell fluxes aswell. 
---
3. Good luck!
---
I wish more ppl thought and played like you!
---
Okay I'll be on in like 7½ hours so if your patient I can give you one. I'd scale it to your level of course so you can keep on leveling up
---
The pure way (no broken armors for legendary prefixes) makes the game truly challenging.
---
The impure way (broken armors you can't remove, min-maxing negative and positive Damage Reduction values to achieve 0 DR) can be tedious to manage but serve to make up for some of berserkers' weaknesses but still be relatively challenging for the 50% bonus damage.
---
Most people in /r/fo76 seem to prefer the impure way which personally wasn't my taste, but running berserker pure was fun for a while.
---
Because it's a Mystery
---
The first 3 times I did this event, everything went well.  Had a full group, some were a little lower (none lower than 50), but nothing that all of us couldn't handle together as a group.
---
The fourth time I did this event I was bringing a friend who had not done it before but was level 91. I have the feeling that we entered the event a smidge too late, and were put in the second (or third) group. We entered as a group of 4.  Myself (about 145 at the time), my friend, and two suspiciously similarly named people of varying levels - one was around 140 and the other was around 40.  By suspiciously similarly named I mean they were something like "Agnes" and "Agness".  I imagine it was one person who was very poorly dual boxing, even though I've never seen a dual boxer in this game (do people do that?), because it was rare that they would both be shooting at the same time, and more often than not one of them would just be wedged into a corner crouching and doing nothing, though that inactivity seemed to switch back and forth between them.
---
It was \*so frustrating\*.  We nearly lost the fight, I easily went through 5000 ammo, almost all of my stimpacks, and my friend and I died multiple times.  These two did barely anything.  Occasionally they would shoot, but only one at a time while the other stood doing nothing or crouched into a corner.  If it was a new character someone was showing the ropes, I would be a lot less annoyed.  But this seemed pretty clearly like one guy who wanted to get his alt some easy experience.  It would be really nice to be able to avoid the super low levels getting into this event, though I'm not convinced that my particular issue would have been solved with a restriction.
---
There's a mod that implements text chat, but it's a global chat and not that many people use it, so it's use is very limited.
---
How there still isn't text chat in a multi-player game is beyond me.
---
60 second timer on respawns kinda annoying, especially when it lags so bad you only notice your death 2 seconds after it happened, or escaping the mine with 10fps and more than a second input lag and die wait 60seconds, respawn outside, no lootcrate 
---
its like vaultraids all over again,wont do it in this state
---
Me from 123 days ago thanks you.
---
I agree.  Bethesda is using 3rd party sources as a crutch. Global text chat maybe should have a cap cost. Area and Team text chat should be free.
---
I have a furious handmade level 15 you can have. Plus 1k 5.56. Psn snow-ninja. Will be on later today
---
So basically I should stay down in the cave, loot all the wendigos and just vibe down there?
---
Blackwater mine, kill all the mole miners outside, then all the ones inside, waddle out all over encumbered and sell all the weapons at Whitesprings station, scrap your junk too. Best way to save ammo is use a knife, a switchblade is quick, a combat knife is strong.
---
My psn is RawberryXX, I’ll be on tomorrow morning for sure thanks!
---
May as well...
---
Its a waste of resources. I ended up in there on my own last night. After five minutes it had stopped being fun and was just boring. So I left.
---
This is why you're PTS and the folks complaining aren't oop
---
Wow thank you so much! Psn is RawberryXX I’ll be on in the morning for sure!
---
I have a lvl 50 commando bloody pipe rifle that knocks out a fair number of mobs with ease, with cheap ammo
---
What's wrong with shiskebab? 🤔
---
Plenty of ppl playing with rifles or shotguns and I’m here draining Earle with G. Plasma and bam!  Surrounded by spawns while they’re solely focused on boss....whyyyyy??  Man, don’t worry bout what other ppl think, keep on killing them spawns and farming ur screws. I appreciate you!
---
Do you need 50 caps and some ore? Dying in the collapse spawns you outside and still rewards you, as Earle dies the drop down blocks of again, so then you can't get down though.
---
Dude... I can solo it without dying in 3-4 minutes XD This event it's soooo easy
---
That's what you need to spice it up!
---
Wood armor is great though
---
Is the damage output higher or are you just firing shots quicker?
---
&gt; Must remember that not every single person is min-max'ing &amp; going for ultimate
---
Absolutely, i agree 100%. But when talking about what is good and what is not then it is not about personal preference or if the weapon is "ok", it's about math and numbers, what is good and what is not.. And in that regard TS is one of the worst there is. Increasing damage by 25% and adding massive recoil and accuracy penalty and breaking the weapon twice as fast is not by any calculation good. Only things that are worse than TS are nocturnal, mutants, assassins, and the ones that increase damage on certain specific enemy type.
---
Maybe my picture was you?? It does make sense actually if you don't have the marker -- didn't think of that. All good fun anyway! :)
---
Blocker, Serendipity, Ricochet, Lifegiver, Adamantium Skeleton, and Dodgy perks work just as well as armor, and a pure Berserk build is less likely to be effected by changes to the game in the future (depending on how you play it). I have a Berserk archer character who's fun and difficult to play (I can easily take a few big hits, but many smaller ones will quickly kill me; I need to be accurate to hit limbs and fast when I'm surrounded). It's a hella fun build, but playing it clean relies a lot on skill and positioning to stay alive
---
Get Gauss shotgun.....that's it :-)
---
Why did I read this in Mittensquads voice?
---
Personally, i hoard a lot of chems and then i sell them to bot vendors, any left i sell them on my camp for 1 or 2 caps.
---
What is it and how do I get it
---
Down with the raiders! Communist collectron is best collectron. Us communists are obviously the most important faction in the game, look at all the atom shop items we have!
---
Everybody liked that!
---
It is....for dying. That's the point.
---
Max rank with the settlers 750gb I believe
---
Buy the plan from the Settlers for gold after reaching max rep. That's a long road though if you don't know what I am talking about :-)
---
I hella fucked them over
---
Not really, after launching the nuke they just leave the place and not enter at all
---
I'd gladly trade it for a tenderiser plan or ultracite calibrated shocks plan.
---
A lot of people won't agree, but I do. Remove all legacies.
---
They plan to release and update with scaling, right? So eventually this isn't a problem anymore since the level 25 will be shooting a level 25 earl. If I underatand correctly. Right now though, its super bad.
---
I'd gladly trade it for a tenderiser plan or ultracite calibrated shocks plan
---
If you do not want to do the farming methods, just as you fight things take the guns and armor off fallen enemies, anything you do not scrap just sell to vendors, most guns will get you 10-25 caps, this might not sound like much, but clearing out an area with a dozen guns to loot and you have a couple hundred caps there. If you do not use chems sell any you pick up. Sell excess rad away and rad x, you do not really need more than 25 of each in my opinion. Be sure to check the map regularly, events pay our well with caps, and if you come to a location clear it out fully, doing this usually gives some caps.
---
9 out of 10 times i die because of:
---
lag during weapon switch or stimpack use
---
general lag in the game that freezes controls
---
rubber banding aka being killed but the game only registering it a few seconds later
---
if it were not for these bugs a penalty for respawn time would be acceptable, although 60 seconds is still too long, should cap at 30
---
Yes.
---
Not exactly, if you can have more than 60 fps, itl work. This game(s). FPS glitches/bugs/exploits, are main thing with this engine.
---
I'm a heavy gun build so I don't touch 5.56 unless it's tp sell it. I have my ammo producer constantly running to make it and convert most of my trash ammo into it. Easy way to stock up on caps.
---
Oh I know, but I could care less about people whining over how much they traded for their obviously duped weapon. And if they got it legit back in beta? dont whine at me or Bethesda, whine at the dupers who fucked up the weapons special status.
---
I love my .50 cal though I don't run bloodied.  Would love to find an explosive one just to play with and try out but for now I'll just stick with my Vampires.
---
Literally just get Stabilized, and emergency protocols on your PA.
---
You don’t *need* any perks for a bloodied HW build. But stabilized is the main reason to use PA.
---
Once legendary perks drop I’d snag the poison resist one, and consider the fire resist one (mostly due to the Ear fight)
---
Dont die???
---
Gotta say it, I kinda think all y'all are bitches, we did it with 4 people in 14 minutes, I'm only level 130ish and I use a vampire's minigun and 2 shot ultracite gatling laser as my main weapons and deal plenty of damage. I think you just need to find a better weapon or be more prepared to spend ammo, ya I went through like 6000 rounds but who cares? I didn't want to let the group down, but 3 low levels could have joined and not made a difference. I normally don't say negative stuff about the playerbase on this game since for the most part y'all are great but come on, this game has more problems than just this. This is minor
---
Are the legendary perks coming with patch 22 though. I appreciate what your saying and tbh I could do with that legendary perk right now. New event got me running on empty.
---
Bet
---
Ty for the chuckle ,
---
It’s a long grind either way but the ally weps are worth it Imma
---
Naaa Iv got a TSE pump, 50.cal, handmade, gauss, lever action and the heavy plasma they are my queen killers and my day to day guns and they weak as piss against the queen but normal mobs not so bad but I dont think they need removing
---
What about perks
---
Are all Power Armors similar? or are they different
---
did it 4 or 5 times now - last run ended after 2 minutes fighting the coloss - quite a bit disapointing
---
Fort defiance is good for this. They have straight jackets that can be sold for about 40 caps per outfit. There's high chance for legendaries since often I find from 1 to 3 legendary ghouls, often 3*. The ghouls themselves are max level, so be prepared for some nice xp as well. And if the door isn't open for the other side, if you run all the way to the back you can find asylum outfits that from most common, brown one, can be sold for ~1k to red one which is the rarest, 30k+. It also has nice amount of chems as well. 🤔
---
My problem is that it's such an amazing quest line but since it's in Fallout 76 it's just a shadow of what it could've been.
---
Also as interesting as it is, it being a vanilla quest meant absolutely no NPCs whatsoever.
---
And heading out with the hope of finding a survivor when you know damn well there won't be is incredibly anti climactic.
---
The last holo tape was pretty good though.
---
It was a nice node towards the very radio shows they were based on.
---
All in all they took what could've been a Thieves guild esk faction and turned it into a bunch of dead ladies and a holotape fetch quest.
---
It just...WoRKs!
---
The ones called shotgunner obviously, than also skeet shooter and enforcer, they live in the same stack as heavy gunner so get them also for variety.
---
Maybe, but the respawn times are ridiculous.  So, at times it will be more challenging bc of low lvls/inexperienced players or just not many participants, it’s defeating not being able to come back for so long. 
---
I’m also finding many ppl passing on the event bc they don’t want to spend the ammo. So definitely hope they mod the respawn times bc with less ppl we will defo die more.
---
It is indeed no problem to remove this items. 
---
They just don't want to for some reasons I have no idea why.
---
As dumb as it would be to have a cost on speaking with people, I'd take anything at this point. Having a text chat might make servers more lively with people talking about random shit.
---
have a vampire plasma gun - flamer which melts the lvl 75 wendigos in a couple of seconds and a vampire gatling plasma which is reserved for the coloss
---
Is Anti Armor good for this one? I’m trying to make it so I can run either full health or bloodied depending on how it goes. My full health deck is currently a VATS Crit Rifleman build with an AA/50%CritDmg/15%CritFill Ultracite Laser Rifle. Is that gonna pull off decent damage or should I rethink my full health deck?
---
PA or not is another decision, not really better or worse for shotgun builds.
---
The protective differences are pretty small due to the hidden damage/rad reduction effects. The biggest is mod availability- there’s a recon HUD that’s only available for x-01, for example (it’s not very useful). Ultracite mods are only available from plans with extreme low droprates for scorch beast/queen. 
---
Lots of people run Excavator for the carry weight bonus; I don’t, I’m at like 375 without it, that’s fine for me. I run Ultracite, but I’ve learned virtually all Ultracite mod plans, and I’ve got the now grandfathered Ultracite jetpack arms, so I have a jetpack as well as an EP torso.
---
Sameeeee, I love it
---
The consuls say yes.
---
use two guns, vamps when a lot of wendigo spawn. and bloodied for clear weak-spot shooting.
---
Because all the dupers will be salty and that's most of their playerbase at this point because of all the mind numbing grinds theyve put in.
---
Or they're simply lazy, it's incredible it's not been done a week after these hacked weapons came out, or after the first few dupes flooded the market with these things. But years now? Come on...
---
That was my original plan but forced myself to play Nuclear Winter
---
Didn’t you try to just switch sever?
---
Thnx :) last question is getting these Misc Mods hard?
---
Sory for the noob question
---
You said it was two level 30s. You don't fail an event because two out of eight players are performing subpar.   It sounds like the high level players there sucked and make themselves feel better by blaming their failure on the two level 30s
---
Huh, I've always been a rifleman. What perks are good for a commando build?
---
I totally forgot Fallout Shelter has achievements. I basically completed it on my phone when it first came out but not touched it since
---
The thing is when you're stuck with only low levels. Sure three low levels could've joined you and not made a difference, but when it's you and one other high level, you're not gonna be able to finish the event on time unless you happen to be bloodied. I also use a Vampires Minigun and AA Gatplas. It's awesome. I can't die. Ammo isn't a problem. Time is. We only have 30 minutes. I'm not bloodied. Me and three low levels aren't going to kill Earle in 30 minutes, but I probably shouldn't speak against such a hardcore 76 player. Maybe you'll use your BE Gatplas on me and take a whopping 20 of my caps
---
The other raid was annoying as you did have to make another character, get them to lvl 20 and then so the raid but once it's done it's done. I now have a spare lvl 27 melee character if I ever need her.
---
I highly doubt bethesda either cares about dupers or anyone else who played longer then a few weeks. All the content we got the past 6months are annoying fetchquests and grind to oblivion, we should be annoyed. Also that's the reason the support doesn't work and we are punished with all this bugs, if they want they can fix almost everything within a month.
---
New players spending money, people who play for months likely don't pay for atoms and first or new game copy's. Sure some does, but not the majority.
---
Bring a Friend, or at least make sure you have someone in a Public Team, cus if you Die After the Colossus you spawn Outside the Mine
---
I've done this 3 times on a lvl 88 character, first time I Died before I could loot the Corpse, second time I looted the corpse but Died before I could get to the chest, third time was the same as the second, but I was able to Fast Travel to a Public Team member who was still inside
---
Farm water and tatos. Green thumb gives you 2 for 1 and hard bargain gives you 2 caps per. So each tato is worth 4 caps. With a bunch of them and many industrial water purifiers, you will be swimming in caps
---
Depends on the armor and the mod. You can buy plans for the mods for all the T-series and x-01, so those are “Easy” but expensive. Excavator used to be only random mods from a few vendors; I think it’s got plans now?
---
Since t-65 exists now, I’d go for that unless you really want the carry bonus of excavator. Plans are all from Bullion, and it’s got the highest resistances (not that it’s a big difference, but when you’re bloodied, every little bit can’t hurt)
---
As a note the only way to get a jetpack on Excavator is with some of those custom Atom Shop jet packs (the ones from the Legendary Run might work too)
---
I'll sign here.
---
The game is too easy.
---
The new character is a pain because it feels so slow (especially if you are uses to mutations).
---
Is it safe to assume once they bring out the enemy scaling that these low level player will be of more help? I doubt the colossus itself will scale but at least if the wendigos do they can help with damage control on them :-)
---
I've seen a few of the mutations outside the Daily Ops on normal world creatures, not sure if that's intended or not...
---
Why? Beth doesnt troll reddit for feedback. Hell, they dont even listed to the PTS players or official bug reports.
---
I'm hoping this is a feature and not unintended but it' seems exactly the kind of thing Bethesda will think needs fixing.
---
I’ve duped and I’ve got legacies because of it. Not insane amounts just one of each to have for myself. But I’d love for them to get removed 😂. Would be an interesting read on Facebook! Haha.
---
Good luck! Good think about Nuclear Winter is you just have to down them to get it classed as a "kill". I'm not a fan of it at all but once it's done, you don't have to touch it again
---
I have 2 bloodied items. One is a broadside, the other is something else I don't remember, I play a full hp build and play 4 or 5 days a week but sure, I'm a hardcore player
---
The problem is that it's just not that simple of a problem to solve.
---
Do exactly as you said: 
---
* You'll have a bunch of people pissed off that their prized weapon (either knowingly bugged or not) lose it. 
---
* You suspend a lot of burner accounts but dupers still have alt accounts to play with so nothing changes there.
---
* You don't actually fix the means by which things are duped/hacked/bugged, so it all goes back to business as usual for the dupers/hackers in a short period of time.
---
* Bethesda creates a whole lot of extra work for themselves which means less time/money/energy devoted to content.
---
The little guy is disadvantaged and pissed while the cheaters are barely tweaked.
---
It's basically a war on drugs approach to the issue. Absolutely ineffective long term.
---
This is a problem that should be fixed, 100% agree. However, it's a long term problem to solve. They need to fix so many underlying issues that there is little point until a good chunk of those issues are dealt with.
---
The community managers are.
---
Congrats! I took a year break and came back a few weeks after Wastelanders (hadn't 100% it before) and decided I want to play it again. Loving it now
---
No one cares about Steam Achievements ;)
---
Honestly, I feel because most people who find it don’t want to ruin the surprise of coming across it yourself for others. One of the best surprises from my launch experience.
---
While I fully agree, again TSE will wreck most any PvE enemy but the upper echelon. Sure it'd be less than ideal for SBQ or Earl (to put it lightly), but I'd wager neither of us would have issue with clearing West-Tek or any other general location with a TSE. Repairs are basically moot after a point, especially given they're just doling out kits with the run. So that leaves what a (generous) 5% of enemies?
---
Your logic on it being not great I will agree with but for almost every encounter for most players they will still be a capable weapon.
---
End of day OP should play with it, if they find use in it then...? It shouldn't be worth much in a trade so what's the ultimate harm? Not everything is white or black, outside the pure numbers which is situational in &amp; of itself.
---
Just the actual achievements for Gamerscore. There is no way I can play this game for 7600 hours
---
Only reason I'd ever dupe would be to make backups incase a inventory steal hack comes around again, since Bethesda seems inept at providing backups themselves.
---
Havent managed to get one before theyve patched them though, but I've been aware of some way before at times and their response is always way too slow.
---
Damn let people have fun. We 3 manned it 300+,300+ and  28. 8000 rounds but we killed him. Bugged weapons aside.
---
I joined one today. I’m level 70 had two others close ta my level ,2 low level an the rest 300 and up. We failed, my bad y’all. I went down twice.  I thought my lmg and lever action was enough.  It wasn’t. If I would have brought my plasma cannon I really think I could have helped more.
---
Beth isn't reading here, only one community manager is semi active.
---
You can get those quite easily to be fair, been a while since I did it but just have to be conscious of your karma (or whatever it's called)
---
I’ve never seen (or at least noticed) a single free event to fast travel to
---
You don't have repair kits from the SBQ event?
---
TFA
---
... wait, there's a global damage nerf coming? What the fuck?
---
I didn't get credit for the colossal problem event after we killed it because it said escape the mine so I fast travelled out thinking it would be like the mine event in the ash heap and was wrong. Bye rewards and 2000 rounds.
---
Yeah I agree that the ability to produce more bullets softens the blow of needing to fire more, but that also misses the point entirely. I guess it's just another symptom of the same problem - prolonging the grind to create the *illusion* of content.
---
The most enjoyable patch in any game I've encountered was v1.10 in Diablo 2. *Everything* was nerfed sooooo hard that most main characters just became mules, and on top of that all enemies were strengthened so much that they could 1-hit most players with the old "builds". But they encouraged in-depth builds and creativity by implementing synergies between skills and new weapons and armor. The nerf was the cost of adding a whole world of depth and theorycrafting to the game. You could sit there for hours with a calculator trying to match things up to come up with a new build.
---
A nerf with no payoff is like shrinking characters down to 10% size and saying they made the world 10x bigger - it's exactly the same, it just takes 10x longer to get anywhere.
---
And a more specific point.. was durability increased? Or weapon degradation slowed? I doubt we will see that happen. Yes, I can pump out more bullets, or just swing my weapon more times, but I will be repairing my automatic rifle over 5+ times per ACP event instead of the 3 times I'm doing currently.. and ACP doesn't even give Improved Repair Kits as a reward, does it? So either it is a scheme to make ATX Basic Repair Kits relevant again, or simply another way to show that they don't consider the big picture when making a *major* change, regardless of whether said change is needed, or justified, or even okay at all. They make a change but don't zoom out to see what it affects.
---
Magic weapons refers to hacked weapons, not over powerful weapons.
---
&gt; but I'd wager neither of us would have issue with clearing West-Tek or any other general location with a TSE
---
No, we would not have any issues. Like we wouldn't have any issues with a non-legendary weapon. Like there are videos people soloing Queen without any legendary items. But that is not the point i'm trying to make.
---
If you paid for a hacked or duped weapon, it's your fault you didn't look into it deeper, and Bethesdas fault for letting it go for so long. They need to simply delete them, or even give some compensation after they do. Knowing them itd be an atomic shop item or something. 
---
And if all the Legacies and Hacked weapons get deleted, that's a lot of most of the dupers "Currency" because of how incredibly duped they are. It wouldn't fix duping, but that's not the goal here. The goal is to get rid of these insanely over powered weapons because they're being abused absolutely constantly.
---
Some people get angry their funny gun gets deleted, but it's their fault they're participating in illicit activities. I know better than to go trading for those things, it ruijs the fun of the game because you sont even need to build into half of these guns because they're so over powered. so what would be the point of even playing anymore. 
---
It would just make for a healthier game
---
Went to event as level 83, there was way higher level (at least 300) player waiting, so we went duo. I usually walk with 200+ stimpacks, loads repair kits and thousands of ammo, since I mainly play as melee. Luckily I have auto stimpack gear and perk. High level player got killed very soon and leave/disconnected. I killed too many wendigos and finally they stopped spawning. Then took boss half health, fucker mutated and then again to half health. Time run out.
---
Community managers belong to Bethesda. Hence why two of them are semi-active here. They don't have to be active here at all, it's not a site they moderate. Of course they don't scramble here everyday, now and then is better than never.
---
Well for not being a hardcore player, you sure talk shit, calling everyone a bitch. But I guess you did regret that, seeing as you edited it to "overreacting"
---
I got a bloodiest faster swing speed 1 strength out of the purvayor.... I was pretty chuffed
---
I would kill (in game) to be able to hear "who not going to eat the meat? Chaaaaalllyyyy"  whenever I want. The way he says Chally's name just puts a huge smile on my face.
---
I did that before you commented, I decided it was too much for the internet, amongst my friends sure, but there are no friends here to no overreact about it so yeah
---
Definitely they should do that, or change the notification to "legendary enemy has regenerated"
---
Wouldn't most of us.
---
Try the market sub. But no ones selling for caps, and 100% not giving then away
---
Yup, where I live it would be taken as light hearted, on the internet people take it as the most agro thing ever so i changed it to not offend so many people unnecessarily
---
Ditto. Full health rifleman build and I've been very lucky not to have ever experienced the fast travel bug. I wonder if there's something to that...
---
Assault rifles are on enemys once you hit lvl 20ish.
---
If you want a good rifle NOW then go for the handmade rifle, currently the go-to auto rifle ingame from beginning. Its like the ak47.
---
Either you buy the plan to craft it yourself from the free states vendor at harpers ferry or whitespring interior, or you check out lootable spots like Berkley springs which could spawn the gun on two locations. Also blood eagles  can drop the gun.
---
My Gauss Minigun is gonna eat well tonight.
---
I got one on the second day of meat week. Got an instigating fixer the week before... It happens, just not enough.
---
Functionally worthless? Tell that to the unyielding sentinel wood leg with AP refresh I just traded for a Tattered Field Jacket
---
Oh my god... I hated this quest line so damn much. And you can tell from the writing that you're SUPPOSED to hate it.
---
I had to do it a second time when I switched from console to PC and as soon as I got to it I thought "oh god no... the horrible memories of this quest are coming back..."
---
I did a long time ago
---
As someone with frequent hearing issues, I’ve stopped playing. I ran the solo storylines on three characters. I enjoyed it, I love the world, liked building... but there’s only so much to do when it feels like you can’t actually interact with people most of the time. If they add in text chat, I’m back. Until then? Playing other online games that actually let me communicate. (Which is like... all of them...?)
---
Trade it pal, I swapped mine for a bloodied exploding  ms flamer, a bex90 minigun 200 presents fixer plan and an emmet hazmat suit. People really want that roll
---
Patch 23: When we increased the carry weight of the ‘Chally The Moo-Moo’ Backpack skin, we accidentally deleted the inventory of every character who was using it. Unfortunately, we were not able to restore the deleted items, however in compensation we are having a 20% off sale on ALL items in the atom shop (for one day only (yesterday) ). Sorry for the invincible
---
Thanks! I will keep an eye out
---
https://i.imgur.com/Rjzhmoy.jpg
---
That would be good. A 3 star should mutate 3 times (and get 3 random mutation aswell). Then it should drop 3 star item.
---
I just completed like 5 on xbox in the past few hours.
---
Came here to say this. Clear the entire building and take every straight jacket you see, then head to a vendor, drink a beer, take some grape mentats, put on Hard Bargain 3 and they'll sell for 50 caps each. If you got all of them, you should hit the 1400 limit with a few left over. The spawns are all guaranteed (unless another player grabs them) and always in the same spots, so once you do it enough you'll know exactly where to look. I've done it so many times now that I can have the building cleaned out in just a few minutes.
---
If that's the case, we need our 35 and 60 round mags back
---
No to removing legacies. Yes to removing magic weapons. Legacies are good to have if you get in some trouble (especially with the upcoming damage nerf). They can't one shot all enemies.
---
Magic weapons however are glitched and do one shot most enemies. They do need to and are patching the glitches associated with magic weapons.
---
You don't have to deliver prime meat for the cookout to complete, I'm pretty sure it doesn't add to event progression at all just gives you five legendary scrip.
---
At least I got chicken.
---
I just want fences that can go down a slope.
---
Good to know.
---
I've been interesting in getting a legacy as a collector for some time but most people who are offering them only want top tier gear at a minimum so I don't think they are as easy to get. The only real problem is 'who' has them as there are responsible ways for players to use them.
---
I agree with you hacked weapons are unacceptable but that's on Bethesda to take care of, all we can do is report players abusing them and hope Bethesda looks into it.
---
In my experience most Magic guns are not much better than what Bloodied can do and I personally only use them to finish off tanky enemies after others get their tags in if it's a legendary. I rarely play on my own and often let my friends and others get hits in first. Furthermore, the estimated problem is server lag with high RoF or Shotguns in Vats doing more damage than intended. It's not that the weapons are extra special, or have rare bugs, everyone can get one with relative ease. These are the most acceptable of the three given they tend to have less impact on others' performance or causing crashing (when they do it's more likely Explosive which still can on non-magic guns just as much) and the prior mentioning they often only marginally out preform the bloodied meta at best unless it's a bloodied magic gun (or the magic armor piece). The real upside to magic weapons is the traits causing it tend to be sub-optimal or otherwise bad and unwanted traits like stalkers, bashing, or limb damage so they actually add to build viability by being more common for the wider majority of players provided they learn to use them responsibility.
---
My conclusive thoughts are this: Fo76 is mainly a PvE game, if you didn't need to tag enemies for exp and loot, kill hogging wouldn't be so much of a problem. Yes that would open the door to more leaching but that's arguably less of a problem since a majority of players don't need the help for most content anyway. I don't really care for PvP in 76, I use Passive mode at all times and only have a problem when someone is trying to take my workshop, which is why I only use them on a privet server now or only defend my fusion core generator if I care enough. (I'd prefer getting a core processor or recharger for your camp like the ArmCo Ammo maker.)
---
I agree these weapons can be problematic and am not opposed to the eventual fixing of magic guns but I would argue the root is more bad players, the need for an improved loot and exp system, and a buff/rework to make more weapon types and traits more viable.
---
The problem with legacies, is that they weren't supposed to be in the game in the first place and they've been abused and duped to high hell. The privilege is lost, they need to be removed. They're still too powerful in comparison to the rest of the sort of weapons you can get.
---
Very good points, the ammo cost can be huge especially for those heavy and commando weapons that aren’t magic. I haven’t died in an event in a very long time but that could just be chalked up to my experience. But like lower levels should definitely pass on this event until they at least can pull some weight. If not attacking Earle then clear the wendigo spawns.
---
I am thinking of making one of my alts a berserker because I got an explosive minigun with 250 DR while reloading from the new windego event
---
I imagine you as the man In the Texan war of independence who carried two rifles into battle (muzzle loaders). When asked about it he said
---
“Damn the Mexicans; they killed my son and son-in-law in the Alamo, and I intend to kill two of them for it, or be killed myself.”
---
Yeah was gonna say this. It's only for scrip. Still shitty it's happening - I've had the most luck in the Ash Heap, doesn't seem to fail as much there for me and it's a good acid farm for cave crickets if it does so not all is lost.
---
Mmmm couldn't say. I personally run one and melt everything, usually solo SBQ or Wendigo without dying... but requires some skill, correct selection of perks, god roll weapons and armor (i run a b2525 handmade and a b3325 fixer, and a Secret Service armor set with 4 unyielding + AP regen + weight reductions and a life saving chest (very important this one, specially if you like to play solo).
---
My wife runs a Heavy bloodied and with a B2590 .50cal and a BE90 LMG melts pretty everything, and she runs with a T60 PA with emergency protocols, calibrated shocks and cant remember arms.
---
Everything depends on perks and making a viable build
---
Oh, thanks, already grinded to 98 yesterday
---
There's actually a quicker way to finish this.
---
If you make an appointment 2 weeks in advance, you get to skip the line. Just make sure you get there early, because you still have to wait for an available window when you get inside.
---
Tomorrow you log in, nuke flying, 4 sec on the clock, and yes you're in the zone.
---
So, if you want to delete all duped items, then your "back-up" stash should be deleted too, like every else.
---
I have done this a few times now, always been tough even with a lot of people. Hardest was when me and 1 other guy did it, took ages, died loads and I ran out of ammo but we managed.
---
Ive do e the same as you but also 1 and 2 and tactics
---
Well leave the legacy guns alone they exist move on. The hacked gear and magic weps are different though. Apperantly from what parroted beth doesnt have the tools for checking hybrid or hacked or guns. They apperantly need to do individual checks on each account. The issue with a system for detecting hybrids or hacked guns is that banks on bethesda being confident something they arent. If theres a hitch in the system (which with bethesda you bet there will be). If peoples weapons get deleted or accounts marked for cheating youll have lots of bad press and angry players. Reason why things like laser musket were removed well because its easy and safe. You gotta remember this game is being held together by duct tape, chewed gum and people who arent the best.
---
Don't bitch about duping one second, then try to justify a reason to dupe the next
---
Yea a rework would be great, a rebalance and such to make certain perks more useful, but "Magic" effects are far past that, considering one of them is junkies. So some of the legacy J/E plasma gets are shredding bosses like the queen and Earle in seconds. Bot hacked, just bugged. And even without the bug they were doing far more damage than bloodied, that's for damn sure. 
---
Legacies were cool and most games wouldn't let us keep them considering they weren't intended. But the Dupers abused that chance and made them extremely common on certain markets right now, they're only so expensive because there arent people dropping then everywhere yet. Otherwise they'd be paid in caps.
---
Lets look at it from the perspective of Bethesda.
---
They keep legacies in the game, they piss of a minority of the player base and still get money.
---
They remove legacies, they piss off a lot of people, they likely leave the game, Bethesda loses money as less people are buying FO 1st and atoms.
---
Bethesda just doesn't make money from removing legacies, so why would they do it?
---
same here, no problems at all on xbox
---
Pneumatic torso mod
---
no but there are some combinations of junk and lead/steel/other plus the collectron you already have, check falloutmaps for locations, the one spot south of crater is pretty neat
---
Never said I managed to get a backup yet, some of the dupers I've seen recently need third party software and I'm not interested in that. Regardless it'd be a price I'd be willing to pay to have a semblance of balance
---
Currently, not that I'm aware of.  Maybe at some point if Bethesda ever starts listening to their players.  It's ridiculous that a ghoul can stagger me when I'm wearing Power Armor.
---
The Gauss rifle is vanilla, and can be looted by anyone. The guass shotgun, pistol, and minigun are all plans learned from the wastelander's bullion grind, and cannot be looted until you learn the plan.
---
Technically the commando damage is a little less, but you fire so much faster, the enemies die quickly. You will use more ammo too. My commando character can easily handle enemies I would struggle with on my rifleman character. Both are full heath sneak characters, but commando is a little sneakier.
---
Still ridiculous that they havent put any time into this, or at the least havent put any public effort.
---
also legacies, most anyways, need to be removed just the same. they used to be rare and powerful and that's alright, but they were duped to high hell and how they're everywhere, and they ruin most events right now, cant even do workshops without someone pulling out a Plasma gat just to take your 15 steel
---
Adamantium Skeleton I believe.
---
Oof, I tried Fallout 1 a few years back when it was free and I'm not used to that style of game. Will definitely have to try it properly when I get a better PC
---
I once killed it with just one mate, it was a pain in the ass tho
---
You are a member of this consul, but we do not grant you the rank of master.... sorry, wrong sub
---
I joined the event and everyone had killed it before I got down the hole
---
I started on them and done them in order well done on your achievement btw
---
Never said that if I managed a dupe for a backup  that it would still be a good thing. I'd be perfectly fine being unable to manage my own backup if it meant there would be a semblance of balance in the game.
---
though it would be nice if Bethesda could set up their tools for backups so I dont have to keep an eye out for a dupe before another inventory steal hack comes along. Where they would suddenly be able to recover items again.
---
Where do you add the meat to get the scrip?
---
It's really not that big of a deal. Just shoot them first.
---
Mind if I pm you?
---
This basically sums up my experience with the game. You play the story, wastelanders, other side quests, etc. you go all the way to the end and all that's left is grinding faction rep and gold bullion after that, what's next? Sure you could do events like Earle or meat week to get uniques for bragging rights, but after you get that Gauss shotgun or minigun what's next? Adding a text chat might help adding some liveliness to the game at the very least. Till then I've got gold to grind!
---
guess I really should be thinking more in the mindset of a greedy corporation. Glad this is the state of gaming nowadays. cant have balance if it means losing a couple thousand to their billions
---
There are two big grills on one side of the clearing, one has a yao guai spitted over it
---
You can't HANDLE the drums!
---
Adding prime meat isn't a huge factor in completing the cook out successfully. Its really just optional to allow you to get scrip and meat sweats.
---
There needs to be some punishment for dying
---
That is the way to do it. And thank you!
---
Does the  colossal wendigo drops something special? I've done it but I died right before the boss die. When I was going to loot it, my character just died again (by fall) and appeared outside. I earned the event's rewards.
---
By "something special" I mean plans, etc.
---
That would be awesome, hopefully, they do something like this at some point.
---
Welp cant remove dupes without pissing people off and its not fair to average joe if you wanna nerfem go for it. Its also 76 you gotta realize what game this. They cant do a simple tweak without breaking something. How long has the fast travel bug been around? They ignore problems.
---
Feels bad, but sounds kinda funny.
---
Not the actual corpse, but the rewards for completing the event. You can get one of three unique Colossus camp items; a colossus plushie that makes a sound when you activate it, a colossus skin rug, and a colossus taxidermy.
---
Yes, bird bones, marsupial and class freak. You can just jump over them.
---
thx!!
---
Nobody:
---
Me at the event:
---
No power armour on 
---
Only 2k rounds
---
And wearing a chally cow suit
---
And has 80 super stimpacks
---
ya I was telling people before this got released it was going to have some problems with it and all the fanbois were having none of it. Now look. Its a fucking mess just like I predicted lol
---
Sub notes: Magic weapons don't clip through the wall and shouldn't instantly kill the Wendigo Colossus. I mained a magic Junkie's Guess Minigun with FFR and Junkie's Ultracite Gatling Laser with FFR and rarely procced any extra damage, if at all, and only had confirmed instances on the adds which benefited the team.
---
As for being an easy fix, it's not that simple for any of the three, many players like having their lagacies and can use them responsibility and it would be unfair to players who invested in obtaining them. Yes many were duplicated, but buyers may not have known and paid tons of caps for them. Removing hacked guns would take monumental effort on Bethesda's end without our help reporting them.
---
The only immediate solutions I think Bethesda should do is in-game inform/remind the larger player base to be more respectful with legacies (and similar common curiosities and tips like not sitting on the fence or tents during SBQ fights) and maybe rework looting mechanics for legendaries.
---
So the one with the bear on it?
---
I disagree. There wasn’t one before up until a few months ago and it’s needless.
---
I just want the legacies to be removed, their an outlier to the power scaling and were never meant to be common in the first place. With their trash engine I dont expect them to solve duping anytime soon but the least they can do is remove things that shouldn't even be in the game anymore, or at all. 
---
But, "They dont have the tools for it" or "Theres engine limitations" theyve done item wipes before, removing things from accounts, including duped items because of certain item tracking techniques, they can do it, they just won't
---
And the one right next to it yes.
---
Scattershot-reduces shotgun weight and reloads them faster
---
Blocker-rank 3 reduces incoming melee damage by 45%(I believe)... 370+ levels with shotguns and I didn’t add blocker until after 200...Amazingly helpful
---
I would suggest Psycho, so you can pop psycho anytime without having to worry about accidental getting another addiction because you decided to go Formula P.
---
So the grand exchange from runescape?
---
You also used to drop your junk when you died at public events. They got rid of that. I think the timer is good. There needs to be some draw back for running bloodied or not playing smart and dying. Games are ment to have some challenges to them.
---
"Hi, thanks for the feedback, we're taking your issues on board, and will address these issues as soon as possible.  We will update you on this. ^but ^don't ^hold ^your ^breath ... what? No, i said thanks for your patience"
---
Berserker commando is a blast.
---
My 900 meat cleavers beg to differ. I got loot last night, although I awoke to an empty server and an inconsolable Grahm. 
---
😢😢😢
---
I just wish they'd put some effort in the weapons designs, maybe an exclusive skin for the revolver and, given de name of the sword, it would had been cool for it to be kopesh. Also maybe a better Mistress' outfit, I really hate the design, but that's a personal taste.
---
Not all of us are dicks fortunately, I'm dropping every legendary to the players around me, regardless of roll.
---
Congrats mate! I just got a cursed gun but will keep on doing the event whenever It pops
---
What are you crying about, that there were no innocent passersby for them to murder and stores to rob?
---
That would be awesome, but maybe have it mutate at 10%, 20%, 30% missing (or some other numbers). Getting the Queen or Earl up and down from 50 3 times would be brutal haha
---
This is the reality of the entertainment industry. People only pay to produce something to make money. If they can't make money, they won't make anything.
---
They should just get rid of NW and bring back survival mode.
---
I really like this questline too.
---
Maybe they didn’t keep them active to avoid a Preston Garvey / Minutemen comparison.
---
i remember playing it with my friend a year or two ago and holy fuck it was so awful lol. we both went between absolutely hating it and laughing at how terrible it was every couple of minutes haha. i don't remember how long it actually was, but it certainly felt like at least an hour and a half lmao
---
You cant take legacies away they dont do that in other ganes especially if an in game economy is involved. How would you feel if you got gear in any other mmo and they took it because they felt like it. Its not how it works and theyll get hsmmered by bad press. Theyve also only done wipes on certain items that are again simple. Like having more than 8 support scrap kits or more than 1 of each v94 plan. Its really just not worth shoutting into the void either beth really doesnt care clearly.
---
All Unarmed weapons on the PTS were bugged and dealt a whole lot less damage than intended. The current PTS build from Aug 21 should have fixed this and brought Unarmed weapon damage back in line with other melee weapons. There seems to be another bug with the damage calculations for energy weapons, which has not been fixed yet.
---
And yes, bloodied builds generally should expect around 40% less damage output on PTS than on the current life servers. The nerfs - as has been explained repeatedly - are not bloodied-specific but affect all outgoing damage bonuses. The more bonuses you stack in your build, the greater the reduction in outgoing damage. Bloodied still does more damage than all other builds, Junkie's is still 2nd place. The gap between builds is just not nearly as huge as before.
---
But it would make a challenging fight ;)
---
I remember when games were made to be fun and entertaining
---
It most certainly would haha
---
Yeh that broke me a little inside lol, c'mon 30 in a drum mag... Beteaseda...
---
Maybe i am greedy but i always sell one ammo round for one cap. Even if it is an mini nuke or a rocket.
---
Cheers.
---
I’m maybe a bit closer than I think then, if downing in NW counts. Thought it was only full kills that counted...
---
you must've only been to cities then. the bigger the city is, the shittier the people there are lol
---
Do you mind sharing your perks with me?
---
Agreed. quick snaps of the trigger does conserve bullets and keeps repairs down.  I went to stealth sniper to avoid having to deal with the constant ammo cycle until I got to a crossbow/Executioner's rifle combo. Haven't visited lucky hole in a month.  Can survive on Monorail weights and  whatever I pick up.  I remember keeping 50K .308 in my stash as a good buffer so I only needed to do the lead/gunpowder runs once a week.
---
Same for me, I did this event 4 times yesterday, conpleted all and didn't die a single time, that's coming from a junkie stealth commando.
---
The problem is, most other games dont have their items duped to oblivion and back. Theres literal millions of these guns, more of these guns than there are people playing the game. If Bethesda cant remove the ones that were duped, they may as well get rid of them all. It's the Dupers fault.
---
 I usually make a profit on shotgun shells, cripple the big fella, then go and kill wendigos.. then when he regenerates cripple him again and back to wendigos,   
---
I get 20-30 from a lot of wendigos and it takes only a couple to kill them with my explody bangstick
---
I’ve done it two or three times today, when Earle dies... get to looting. I never bothered running for the exit, When the countdown timer expires it teleports you outside... with the rewards
---
I'd rather some additional mechanics be added to buff unsuppressed weapons. There should be some sort of potential value in intentionally going loud
---
a mag that irl could hold 75
---
Agreed. I spend way more stims reviving others than actually using them myself.  
---
I try not to discriminate between levels but if you keep dying, there is a point I will stop stimpacking you.   
---
Even high level bloodied builds are a drain on my stimpacks. I feel like a nurse in this event :-)
---
People initially complained about automatic guns being weak when this game was released, and they buffed those receivers if I'm remember everything correctly.
---
Unfortunately it had the side effect of kind of making the advantage of semi-automatics less advantageous as far as damage output because you're really only looking at relatively small damage reduction in exchange for a much higher rate of fire.
---
I know people don't like automatics that are peashooters, but this is generally game balance 101: Your automatics should not be doing close to the same amount of damage as semi-autos, otherwise there is little to no advantage in using them.  You can argue they're better for ammo economy, but probably not by much since you're not going to be dealing that much more damage versus automatics.
---
And it sucks even more than our battle-rifle and sniper rifle-type weapons might do a lot of damage, but they're held back by either prohibitively low magazine capacities and long reloads, or they simply don't deal enough damage to justify their lower ROF.
---
Yesterday we where like the whole lobby with at least 90 percent of us lv 200 plus and we still didn't make it
---
Check the challenges and you should be able to track players killed in NW and Wanted players and you can get an idea of how many you have to do. Mine finished a few early than the challenges so I'm not complaining lol
---
Why wouldn't he? I'm level 322, been levelling up every day for the lgendary run
---
1. 45 &amp; 5.56
---
2. 5mm &amp; 308
---
3. 50 &amp; 12
---
Thanks man, same after a bit of ammo grinding cause I'm out atm.
---
Legacy weapons were seen as legit until Bethesda patched them to no longer drop, you can say early players should have know Bethesda made a mistake before even they knew it. My friend has a legit (his spawn) troubleshooter's explosive gatling plasma, he only uses it for bosses and non-group stuff. Because not all legacy guns are illicit you really can't call for all of them to be removed with an argument that they did something wrong when they haven't.
---
As if it’s the players fault. that bloodied builds  are over powered
---
At least you could argue that the Plushie could be a generic Wendigo Colossus.
---
The Rug and ESPECIALLY the taxidermy? Not so much.
---
Ok for example when tf2 had that bug for 100% uncrating unusuals they let everyone keep them. Sure its the uncraters fault for unboxing them and abusing the exploit but you cant punish a person for just buying 1 of those hats. Its easier to let them exist then have the public turn on you because you took something away.
---
these bored high level players should just look for players of the same level and above to pick a fight. like maybe try looking for that level 2000 player to begin with.
---
And your loot too I guess? Good to know. 
---
Last couple of runs I was on the other side of the room when Earle died and couldn't even find him :)
---
But again, Hacked weapons should all be removed because here none are legit.
---
I'm not saying it is. But I'm saying for having that great power there are draw backs, one of them is dying more. That's how builds work. You always sacrifice something.
---
Yeah and it sucks... Killing the queen and Earl solo will probably be a thing of the past. Not to mention you’ll be using more ammo from now on, AND they plan on making everything level 100 for you in One Wasteland. I don’t know what’s Bethesda is smoking because none of these are good decisions.
---
Yeah you need the chest piece. The jet pack is a mod for the armor.
---
Longer spawn times is precisely what needs to happen. You shouldn't be able to just brute force your way through an event.
---
Death should come with a penalty and since there isn't much of one generally, longer spawn times is more than fair.
---
Thank you, I'll try that!
---
Thx dude helped a bunch
---
No worries. Hope you get a decent roll!
---
Does one gun army work? The heavy guns perk that cripples?
---
They are too strong, and too common. They were fine when they were limited to the few people who got them to drop back in beta. But now I'm going into Queen events and five of the fifteen people there have the damn things and the queen dies before I can do enough damage to it.
---
I agree with OP saying it's not for level 30s but I think you're right in this case. I had level 30 odds on both runs last night and still did the event.
---
What about gamma rounds ?
---
S: Maxed blocker and bandolier
---
P: Max commandos, tank killer, and concentrated fire
---
E: aquaboy, good doggy, level 1 cannibal
---
C: level 2 inspirational, maxed tenderizer, field surgeon
---
I: maxed first aid, level 2 nerd rage
---
A: maxed action boy, covert op, and sneak. Also escape artist
---
L: maxed ricochet, starched genes, bloody mess, and serendipity
---
I run level 1 armor, some broken, some not. I don't try to get 0DR. I'm usually between 2 and 6 DR.
---
Is this what they’ve brought in?
---
Yer workshops are pvp area, still if there is couple of them at that level, a level 10 not going to be able to take the workshop from them. I do find most players don't attack other player at workstation as most people just use them for get resources.
---
What about times where death is almost unavoidable like a high amount of radiation in the area or other area of affect damage from enemies that will get you caught in a death loop? Would be punishing enough for the player to have to fight through constantly dying to get back to where they were that making the death timer increase over and over seems to become unnecessary overkill. The player is being punished enough by dying so many times in such cases.
---
They made only the first one each person got tradeable, the rest were character locked. whereas bethesda has let everyone keep everything theyve duped because they paid them money a while back and groveled at their feet when they got banned so they get everything back regardless
---
Did 5 happened every time
---
Just turn off pacifist mode and kill away
---
That happened to me once, bloody mess is the worst and the best sometimes. Obliterating the corpse makes it hard to find. I read a post earlier about the event, that’s the only reason I never ran for the exit
---
Shot gun drum mag holds... 12 wtf
---
They all trigger. You didn't see.
---
I kinda feel the need to see the actual gameplay of a JE Gat Plasma killing those bosses in seconds to effectively argue against them existing.
---
Out of curiosity OP, what platform are you on and when did you start playing?
---
Lot of wendigo adds but idk if they are considered glowing. Could try it and see
---
Yea mags need a serious buff if OW is going in the way it is now
---
You're supposed to hate it.
---
So you dont want good armor? I'm compelty new to the whole commando thing lol.
---
Ooooo that have me a good laugh thank you
---
I have them in 2c an they will stay for a week or so in the vendor. Same for cryolator ammo and 2mm rounds
---
Percing mag has 10 rounds. That means the drum adds 2 fucking shells and that's it!
---
I got screwed too
---
PC, mostly since wastelanders, but I've played before then a little bit. though I will admit it depends on the sort of weapons used, ammount, or if there was actually someone using a hacked weapon hidden during the fight, all that I know is that queens are being killed in seconds without anyone being able to properly get kill credit on her, and Bethesda hasn't done anything about it
---
And you still haven’t realized beth doesnt care? You’re probably just better moving on to another game because hate to break it to ya beth doesnt want anymore bad press and would rather turn a blind eye.
---
Oh wow. I better get some more together before trying again. Thanks.
---
I wish you can wear it yourself for a boost. (Without the regalia)
---
Let's be honest most people (like me) are in there for the daily NW challenge and to do their best.
---
Ah okay thanks.
---
Okay thanks
---
I read that in the voice of da orkz and I am pleased.  Thank you for writing this.
---
Sorry I care for a 200$ investment that can so easily be good.
---
I just used power armor to jump in... melee tank build ftw. 
---
For anyone curious. 
---
DR in power armor: 453
---
DR in normal armor: 711 (secret service, vanguard, sentinel, mutants.)
---
My first Colossus was an embarrassment for me, and I must have been 110 something at the time. My Secret Service armor (which is stronger than my Ultracite PA) and a Gatling laser did not prepare me. I was a Wendigo chew toy and spent most of my time being rezzed by my teammates.
---
I went back with better perks, my Ultracite PA and my shiny new Furious Gauss Gatling.
---
I focused on taking out Wendogo swarms, keeping them off my teammates, and putting the smackdown on Earl when I could.
---
It went MUCH better. Preparation and equipment make all the difference, even if you are a higher level.
---
Was jus a thought i had waking up lol not done it yet was wonderin if the adds where glowing ones or not?
---
The piercing handmade mag used to be 35, now its 25, I think its 20 before that as well. for a while in was using the 35 mag before it got nerfed to and it felt just fine
---
I have a furious explosive LMG I've named "Sorry, I panicked."  I'm supposed to be a vats stealth sniper.
---
For Berserker to work you want as little damage resistance as possible. If you have a good armor set on, say something with 100+ DR, you lose the damage bonus from berserker weapons. 
---
Any other build you want the best armor you can get your hands on. Berserker penalizes you. You can have high energy, rad, and poison resistance, but not pure damage resistance. 
---
I have a mule rolling level 1 armor. Both for my Berserker and for the mule. 
---
My Berserker has a decent set right now, I'm just looking for armor with more poison or rad resistance. The mule needs WWR armor.
---
Not gonna lie, as I was typing it up I may or may not have spoken it out loud to myself like a warboss hahaha :D
---
After playing The Wendigo event, some guys in Sheepsquatch outfits were attacking me for likely the same reason. Jerkbags who should kiss a deathclaw
---
Cant really easily be good with beth driving. Dont know what to tell ya you could sit in front of bethedas campus protesting they wont do anything.
---
At some point around level 40 I'd guess, I lost access to the Mistress of Mystery bunker/lair whatever. I still had the full regalia but the laser grid wouldn't give me access (by that point I was long done with that quest line and just popped by on occasion to use the work benches so it wasn't a major part of my game play). I tried to access it multiple times on multiple servers over he span of multiple days, but each time, no entry allowed. So I just sold my Mistress garb and moved on. Not a huge deal, really, but it is kind of a bummer to be locked out of one of the most fun and interesting factions in Fallout lore.
---
Regular Xbox for me
---
In terms of damage, unarmed melee but being bloodied you're always in risk. I prefer stealth commando because you gain control of situations
---
Oh I see thank you very much
---
Oh alright thank you very much
---
 Now *that* is the Queen's birthday right there.
---
Alternatively, you could just run around in a hazmat suit. 
---
No problem.
---
Not as annoying as the cook off and see 5 level 200 running around trying to just kill critters with no one on the spits and just me on the drums, as well as me screaming down the mic telling them to get on the drums and spits. I'm only level 28 so doing primal events by myself is still a sort of no go. So wasting my prime meat because a level 200 wants the 0.005 exp for killing the critters, is a pass take.
---
Tesla AoE wendigo CC.
---
What?
---
ALL I HEAR IS
---
WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
They are level 75 wendigos so I imagine glow sight would work on them. They do use the glowing wendigo model, so most likely(?), but I haven’t tested it personally. Just be prepared to be deaf by the end of the encounter.
---
im just waiting for it to drop on xbox so I can do it by myself lol, once the damage nerf happens tho, might not be the case, we'll see...
---
"Please be nice guys" is the worst fucking thing to ever say to a large online community. it's like giving a cookie to a kid and telling them not to eat it. You're telling an asshole to not be an asshole. it's not that easy
---
also the clipping isn't a problem with the guns, it's a separate issue with Power Armor. And I've seen for myself what magic can do, it relies on having 60+ frames to properly proc. Someone clipped through the wall during colossal, killed the thing before the rocks fell for the rest of us, and then the event wouldn't properly finish. Hacked or magic it doesn't really matter they both need to be fixed and removed. Legacies would just be a nice bonus because they're still stronger than most other options in the game
---
The Chinese S has to much dr right? I cant remember what it's stars are
---
If you can launch nukes on queen and Earle quick cash save that up buy a serum and sell that easy money
---
I dont think am gona do this event again soon. Yesterday in full server we was only 4 on the event. i was with my 75lvl toon. two guys was lvl 300+ and one was aroun lvl35. They never shoot Earl! They just crouch there hiding in they chameleon armor doing absolutely nothing. I get mad, at least they could stimpack when i was down and after i spend around 3k 5mm and 2k 5.56 and 5 plasma cores i just give up and ft away. If you are not gona do anything and just stand there waiting for the exp and the loot, just dont go there! that event is not like any other event.
---
Will have to try it. Lol will remember to turn my headset down a little thanks
---
Death loops are definitely bad. I feel like they are a bug though, I know fighting the Queen often spawns you in the blast zone. And that should certainly be fixed. But I feel that is a different problem, you know?
---
Yep. The stealth suit will totally screw a Berserker. You'd be better off with a hazmat suit. Power armor is also out of the question.
---
Anyway, me myself running a commando build I always carry bloodied combat knives because unyielding armor makes you almost impossible to spot and close killing enemies it's just fun
---
The gat plas is the only legacy there, cant remember if the gauss is tho
---
And regardless of how you feel, the legacy gat plas guns and laser rifles simply ruin the game, you havent seen what they can really do
---
Oh I see
---
It’s a good change to the queen, and the ammo system they have is an amazing thing that really helps. Good luck with your drops!
---
Thanks again, I’ve never thought to check the challenges what a complete brain-fart!
---
How bout calling them wonkey though....
---
I have about 5 of each appeals, 2 grills, 1 cleaver, 2 tenderizer, 5 flags, 2 peppered, 2 salty, 1 flamer atm(consumed the spicy and tato salad plan/recipe already), but not a single Chally the moo-moo outfit :&lt;
---
To be fair, I only noticed yesterday hahaha
---
You can convert the Pipe Pistol into an automatic pipe rifle once you learn the mods for the receiver and stock from scrapping them. Around level 20 or so you can start getting Assault Rifles and Combat Rifles which also can be made into automatics (check the basement of the Hornwright building in Charleston for an easy AR). At 35 or 45 you can get Handmade rifles, which are the same as ARs but higher damage for no penalty, they're a pure upgrade. The SMG and the 10mm SMG both also count as automatic rifles, and you can find them at many different levels. I know there are two SMGs at the amusement park in the NW Ash Heap.
---
What's your build?
---
Sounds like a war story. War never changes
---
Oh okay. I just hope I got a good enough rifle I remember what all I had on me and I can't get on for a little while
---
Thank you friend looking forward to doing it
---
Find a good group and do it on a private server to make sure you all get in. If you can, if not its kinda a crap shoot on who you get put in with
---
I use a bloodied, VATS-based stealth sniper build.  I only ever die to falling debris (due to tunnel vision, it's admittedly an embarrassing way to die), and even then, I hardly do.  It's weird, since stealth is usually useless in dungeons I enter.  Most the time, I'm just in caution or even just barely hidden.  Though, I tend to alternate between sweeping up the Wendigo Spawns and pumping 1 of the 3 heads full of lead.  Yay Adrenaline Perk!
---
Problem with ammo factory legendary perk it's just another utility perk that you'll use from time to time which shouldn't be there in the first place - it doubles Ammo Smith functionality while wasting slot in the legendary perks that, in theory, shouldn't be changed as frequently as normal perk cards (you're charged 1 perk coin each time you change Legendary perks). For me it's dumb idea altogether - why not boost Ammo Smith to make even more ammo? There are many useful Legendary Perk cards I'd like to use instead of keeping Ammo Factory one in my setup.
---
Referring to the nerf by itself - for me it's wrong approach and lazy programming. Instead of making other affixes viable and powerful, they've nerfed everything by 50% simultaneously making some enemies even more bullet-spongy. For me it's not fun.
---
I love this idea! Big fan of the plushies and hoping to get most, if not all. Got the Earle plushie on my first try, which has a string to it so it makes a growl when pulled. So it should be possible for a grahm one too!
---
At the moment bloodied commando.
---
Nope like many other bugs
---
You know how bloodied builds have so much synergy and get boosts from nerd rage, adrenal reaction, Unyielding armor and so on and so on?
---
Berserker is on the other end of the spectrum. Any DR will lower your damage output. You can't use power armor, the stealth suit, any DR boosting perk cards, I can't eat a scorchbeast steak without taking a hit to my damage numbers.
---
I love my rifleman build, but I've been thinking about the change as well. It's just gonna suck to shelf all of the weapons I've been collecting for my build, but I know they won't do much once one wasteland comes out :(
---
As if I don't have enough weapons lol good tip though I might see if i can do that
---
A line in the sand, in particular, I've stopped doing. The spawn bug was fun for a week. Now, every single time, an explosive weapon fella arrives, makes a mess, and it's a dull way to spend 10 minutes.
---
That and i'm a melee who carries a grenade launcher for area damage. If you hit the bottom back, the moment the mobs spawn, nothing flies anywhere, you everything hit for 30-40 damage, and it's all good. If I'm not quick enough, I hold of firing, and I never take a second shot. But the moment someone pulls an explosive weapon, ftoom. Bodies everywhere, and I'll get all the blame for everything. Eh. 
---
I'm level 130, not interested in legendaries, and I'm rank 88 on score so will most likely finish. Why go to an event like that when I still have main and side quests to do? Areas to explore? I'm sure I don't even have a fifth of the locations unlocked on my map yet. I got other stuff to do and enjoy. 
---
Also, I recently did a line in the sand when it wasn't bugged, and enjoyed it far more than the fish in a barrel routine. I'll wait until the next patch before I start doing it again.
---
This perk is to remove being crippled.
---
Rose is very proud of this collectron
---
Easier said than done in that death trap of a cave
---
they are annoying but not devastating. just jump and use VAT when they attack. just recently, im looking for them little bit more coz i just realise their cooked meat give +1 strength. that in case i need that little bit more of STR to bring junks that i wanna sell at the bot vendor on top of Radstag/ Brahmin cooked steaks that i have already ate. 😅
---
+15 str from uny armour. A good build. Food and chem buffs.
---
Boy I have unyielding plus 1 strength on everything and do 10k dmg im talking those people who one shot bosses
---
A new radio skin. A pineapple, with coconut speakers. That plays a dozen different Tiki tunes.
---
Popular in the 50s.and Bethesda could surely just get in some session musicians to jam out some 'not quite, but nearly' versions of known tracks. No licencing need.
---
Thanks, now I feel even less inclined to check it out, and I wasn't any keen on it to begin with...
---
Whatever you do: do not fast travel outside to switch weapons or get ammo or something. It's weird, you can't go back in. Seriously pissed me off yesterday when I solo nuked it and had to leave because I used all 1000 of my 2mm ammo on it and went to get another gun, only to not be allowed back inside.
---
Might be doing the uny stacking glitch thing, no clue how they do it though
---
There's a npc in lucky whole mine that will have one
---
You need to be logged on before the O clock... By 2 minutes past the event is over
---
I can make plasma cartridges too but idk how many people use plasma weapons
---
Google food build, maaaaany multiplicative buffs.
---
&gt;It's a flawed game. So is every fucking Fallout since 2. The question is not, "is it flawed", the question is "are you having fun".
---
Nicely said.
---
Didn’t even know that was a thing but thanks at least I know my dmg isn’t bad for my bulild
---
I did it with my shotgun because thanks to a bug i had 500 shots in the magazine. I was lagging and switching between the gatling and my super shotty
---
Just did 2 tonight.  Died about 4x’s.(no power armor) had 8 players in both runs(6 ranged 2 Melee) Avg lvl 200. 1 player worked spawns while others Earl. Combo worked great. Pulled the Harpoon, but no mask.......
---
The gat plasma isn’t that good honestly against the queen it’s shite the TSE flamer on the other hand is broken against normal mobs donno what it’s like against the queen
---
Im on console so I can see a source of our disparity here. On XB1 our problems seem to be much lower than what you are experiencing. All 4 of my ACP runs went well and if my 'broken op' magic guns did anything, they helped the 5-7 players teams we had successfully do the event.
---
What is you stance on an unarmed bloodied build being able to solo the SBQ in a few hits?
---
Boy I have all melee food buffs it does not one punch earl
---
So I gotta be careful. And are you able to take on the SBQ and wendigo boss alright?
---
they're almost all broken in some way, and I just think the simplest solution would be to just remove or edit them
---
I tried it and i dont want to do it again
---
I had this recently at an Encryptid, guy runs over and starts the event when there was only a few of us there, sends a load of taunt emotes when the person who started the event gives him the thumbs down. The second all pylons were activated he one shot the robot with a magic weapon and the event ended with no one getting a shot in.
---
Brilliantly though, the exploding robot caught him off guard and downed him. Every other player there just watched him and gave the thumbs up as he begged to be revived. As a bonus i think he got the respawn glitch as he never came back. It was almost worth losing loot for
---
Min level should be no less than Earl.
---
I have a nice 3* bloodied fireaxe I could give you freely but I won't be playing until this evening (8 hours from now). You should also be looking for unyielding armor pieces but be prepared to spend lots of caps
---
GT: delarro
---
yes please!
---
Melee has always been op, but I think it's got enough risks in some aspects, but ultimately should be nerfed as well. However it doesn't compare to some of the things I've seen on PC
---
Damn 401.i thought I waited for ever at 306. Still havnt launches another at 375 though haha
---
I haven't taken Wulfgar to meet Earle yet, but he more than holds his own at Queen fights. I rarely die and generally stay in caution the entire fight.
---
 The gat plasma is shite how is this not sinking in lol I use it for the queen once and a while but mainly use the gauss minigun and TSE 50cal
---
Just be there a min or two early...
---
Legit.. I dont want to play this event if i have to wait so damn long to respawn
---
Oh I have good melee weapons I'm just not sure about rifles. I believe I have a full set of uny also if I remember correctly
---
I've only once accidentally nuked someone's base in that area, I'd normally try to avoid hitting bases or even clusters of players but the poor soul loaded in milliseconds after I had launched the thing.
---
May their base forever rest in piece... well.... pieces :P
---
TSE isn't as good as the bloodied or junkies ones but it should be removed all the same. Just because one of the few legacies isn't good doesn't mean they still arent a problem. Just try using that thing in PvP with some demonexpery perks on, they won't stand a chance
---
There's assloads of hackers and hacked weps in the pc version, that's pretty obvious. And pc version doesn't work well either. So pc version of fo76 is just worse
---
Awesome I think I'll give it a try than
---
Or just don't die at all simple as.
---
Be sure to have and bring enough ammo because the boss is a bullets sponge.
---
Good, you're not suppose to one shot him. If you accumulate all foods and chems together with Revenant perk bonus, Nukashine and weapons with power attack bonus damage is 6-digit.
---
Purified Water, outfits  (like the mentioned fort defiance), or straight up weapons. Find a place that Suits you, kill mobs, Grab guns, sell guns to vendor bots. 
---
I also like to Chuck on good with s alt and Grab all the drops from the enemies. Glowing blood and Meat sells nicely aswell. 
---
I also sell a lot of chems that i pick up.
---
The torso always was available
---
I actually think the building on FO4 is better simply because you could destroy most usless things.
---
If they finally add this feature, I hope I can turn it off. I like the multiplayer experience without verbal communication (text/voice), only gestures and actions. Somehow like Dark Souls.
---
Wouldn’t know anything about the pvp side Iv never bothered because it’s shit and bloodied is broken junkies but they are all getting the nerf hammer soon
---
Shoot me a message if you have any questions.
---
What system are you on?
---
First of all what your spouting is bull 6 digits would one shot earl secondly who really cares if you one shot earl
---
But i love my super shotty. It oneshots everything
---
I haven't died yet dispite having only 4 sum Endurance and Empath thanks to T-65 and Psycho (with the addiction). I did experience lag escaping on public servers but prefer to just loot 2mm EC off my kills durring this time.
---
The worst lag for me was when I tried swaping weapons using the favorites wheel.
---
WTH, I launched my first nuke at level 50, and launch at least 3 each playthrough with not one shot fired till the last room.....
---
Everything but these legacy and glitched weapons are
---
Xbox and can do
---
You? You were asking how people one shot him...
---
You shouldn't have to do this though. It's a simple design flaw that Beth should have fixed last year.
---
lot's of screw,.. screw screw screw haha
---
3rd should be ignore 50% armor. Or is that combi not possible?
---
Ohh mi geersh.. i wants one
---
I did the event with 3 random high leveled people and they were all bloodied. I didn’t do shit and they carried me and it took about 8 mins lol. I only used about 2 plasma cores and died once at the end. So I do think there are certain players who have no issue completing the event, but not everyone is going to have an easy time. I can only imagine if the 3 random people were low levels.
---
They are tradeable, and you can make a new character.
---
I’m level 78 and me and a level 160 dude got him down to the point of mutating and regaining health, but whilst I kept spamming stimpacks and standing somewhere higher up to shoot the Wendigo, but goddamn we struggled and ended up running out of time. I think the dude with me ran out of stims because he kept going down without healing himself at all. Still have yet to finish this, have only attempted once so far though
---
I just got a whopping 40 atoms for the collect 7600 wood challenge. Wowwww
---
The name confused me. I've been away from the game for a long while and so I thought it was a legit new type of weapon added to the game... Of course, it turns out they're glitched weapons or something.
---
Zoinks, Scoob.
---
In the mothman city in the bottom left theres a few cultists that might carry one
---
The first officers were probably killed you will need to go to four terminals and request a replacement. There will be diamonds pointing to 'Defend xxx officer' or something. 
---
Clean your UI by going to pip boy - data and turning OFF every quest except the silo launch.
---
of course ! [https://discord.gg/qWBDgu](https://discord.gg/qWBDgu) there it is, sorry it took around 11 hours to respond, i just saw your message
---
This. I recently discovered the joys of lucky hole mine - I got so much lead to craft ammo with I actually ended up running out of steel. I never thought that would happen.
---
Sounds like an overheating problem... your fan might be on its way out. Im looking at November to replace my S One with a Series X. Microsoft is kinda known for "overheating" issues so i wont be suprised if the new gen follows suit.
---
We all end up back at the lift if we get killed, nothing strange in that.
---
&gt;Glitched weapons
---
Should've been called Bethesda guns
---
I believe it was Angryturtle who started calling them magic and it caught on. But they are kinda magical..
---
Some say the ultracite Gatling laser does more damage, but I don’t know if thats confirmed. One thing is for sure though, and that’s that it fires green projectiles as opposed to the regular which is red. Miniguns are worth using in boss fights if you have a good one, in my experience the slow spin up time makes it useless against normal creatures, so overall the 50 cal is better. Finally, I had twisted muscles on my stealth commando for ages and I never noticed a difference, and class freak works just fine
---
They're fixing scaling so that lower players will be able to compete and be useful.
---
I forget what they're calling it, One Wastelander? I dunno, the fixed scaling is coming soonish
---
I say. It would be cool. If there some MOM server restoration/upgrade quest or something, which will generate some dailys/events like Modus.
---
Crypto or how its called, has some lore, its incomplete, automatic assignment etc. 
---
My math is bad, yes comrade, not eng, its my native language you see! (joke)
---
on one server i was there 15 mins early and no event twice in a row, then i changed as soon as it was 1 min over the third time and found a event on another server.  sometimes it bugs out, lots of other players there too wondering wtf hapened
---
Event is nice. No deaths on my 1st run last nite. Did use  stimpacks.
---
 Just a request to any who are not heavy builds..please keep minions off us so we can keep delivering the boom.
---
The exit was my favourite part.
---
This is what I’m talking about. Did colossal problem earlier and kept dying a lot and it got to a point where my respawn time was a minute. And it was in areas I couldn’t control like getting stunned by earl’s attack that makes you run away scared and I ran over some acid/flames then got swarmed by literally 15 wendigo spawns.
---
Yeah but, what if they only have this gun and it's their best gun and favorite gun, so they don't play ? they can't enjoy the game because you ask to not bring that gun ? so you can enjoy the game with your gun and they can't bring their favorite tesla ?
---
Rando's right tho
---
Dense chest mod and at least 2 ranks of fire proof 👌🏻
---
... lmao...
---
The scaling will affect general around the map levels of creatures, Bethesda have already said there will still be minimum levels of certain creatures regardless of the level of the player, I would assume the bosses of area's/events will have that minimum level.
---
That went off the rails quickly, some people are so quick to throw insults 🤷‍♂️
---
While you certainly have a point about lower levels, i think the problem is more that unless you have a bloodied or a junkie build, you are basicly stuck doing very little damage. These changes arent helping anyone. Bullet sponges arent what makes a game more exciting. I’d rather get 10 enemies, than one with 10x hp and defense.
---
Yeah but in dark souls communication isn't all that important, as for the most part you'll just fight the boss and say bye bye, or you'll play with friends, but I see where you're coming from.
---
Boy I have...
---
We fared pretty well but only because we had bloodied legacies and all of them were either Gatling plasmas or lasers.
---
If you are using an automatic receiver, you need commando. If you are using semi auto (like hardened) use rifleman perks.
---
They do as long as you don't use a full auto receiver.
---
My Anti-Amor Flamer Insta kills any player without fireproof. The PvP is a worthless standard for what guns are OP.
---
I always read it in his accent 😍
---
Can you craft any backpack yet? If not then You first have to learn that before you can catch chally bp
---
You can mod the handmade to either be auto (works with commando) or single fire (rifleman)
---
Enable pacifist mode?
---
I'm having this same problem and I left the building and then came back and he's still not dying. Any suggestions? Please don't tell me I have to exit and come back and kill all the raiders again! 😩
---
Even legacy guns are getting a damage reduction. Hacked may be an exception, but they break all kinds of rules.
---
Since last patch you don't have to craft each backpack separately, you just craft it once and then just apply different skins. That Chally backpack is just a skin.
---
Psn: ScavengerofCrows
---
Will be adding you when i get home from work
---
Alright, thank you very much!
---
:D
---
I was gonna try explain my build to you but it's not like most bloodied builds if I'm honest. Later to day I'll send a screenshot once I'm online and explain it. It's waaay better than a standard bloodied build and stronger than a full health build.
---
A tip though for now is my BE handmade worked better than my BFFR handmade. Vats crticials to Earles head also hits hard.
---
I have received no plans or cursed weapons, just standard armor and weapon drops, RNG is a bitch.
---
36k 5mm rounds are the ready!
---
For bloodied builds i recommend using any max hp buffs, for example tato salad. Otherwise its very hard to survive dot damage
---
I take repair kits in with me, if your gun breaks find a quiet corner (there are a few places you can hide efficiently) and use one.  I din't buy mine they came from event rewards, but you can buy them in the Atom store for emergency use.
---
Thank you! Also happy cake day!
---
I was doing pure stealth rifleman, but after I started doing more events for the legendary run I found I needed more DPS so changed into a a mixed build, with the 3 rifleman perks &amp; the 3 commando perks (all 1 star, along with 3 star bloody mess). It seems to work pretty well, I'm not doing as much damage as a pure build but I enjoy this playstyle with the option to either go sniping or guns blazing.
---
However, with patch 22 I'm strongly considering switching the rifleman perks into commando ones. I should still do decent damage out of stealth with non-automatics, (even if not one-shotting,) thanks to covert operative/instigating/headshots, but those extra 10%'s maybe won't be as useful once they're not getting multiplied into 50%'s.
---
Can confirm it works on Excavator armour
---
Oh ok thank you for replying, didn't know it was a skin lol
---
It starts at the top of every hour, and at worst he would of had time to log onto a different server, the oy way you miss it is negligence of your own, or just trying to show up near the end so you don't have to help, either way it's his own fault.
---
What is the main issue then?
---
i went through 4k ultracite 2mm and 3lk .50cal completing the event. I was primary damage dealer in the group in that instance.
---
Had aggro throughout.
---
Missing a cursed harpoon gun and looking for another miner helmet, anyone selling? (chafednuts87)
---
lvl 300+ Junkies None PA Melee first try.. used around 8 stimpacks... took a while but was in no immediate danger..
---
It's only 8 months old ill get onto Microsoft
---
Idk this sub has always had a problem with dick gobblers downvoting everyone.
---
I think lvl 1-10s are still being given enough stuff from the beginner quests they don't need to be buying things with the few caps they have for fast travel. During the time I had a 1 cap 'New Dweller' machine I very rarely got buys from lvl 1-10s anyways. Before the Wayward came along and ruined my home-from-launch camp area it was really the lvl 10-30s that always ate up my noob stock. (plans=default price/10, aid/chems=3-5c, maps/airdrops=5c, etc, etc) So imo it's more helpful to move a bit farther away and target that newer lvl 10-30 playergroup than the ones still being snuggled along by the game's opening missions.
---
As for actual items/prices? Personally I ditched making low level armor/weapons, too much effort/space for how rarely they sold. Also ditched 1c diluted chems in place of normals for 3-5c. Add in trinkets/fun junk for like 3-5c. I've sold metric fuck tonnes of teddy bears/souvenir items/instruments just cause they're fun items to collect when you're a newer player. Lastly, I avoid 1 or 2 cap prices on things besides components/ammo. Anecdotal, but I could swear that after I raised prices by a few caps the number of higher lvls buying out my 'noob stock' dropped drastically while new player sales remained consistent.
---
Its a common problem with the fans, replaced A One S with a faulty fan. Thank God for warrenty
---
Low levels already have this, it's called Fallout 76.... /s  
---
To be fair though, low levels need to be doing the spawn events to gain experience, waves upon waves of low level enemy's, constant ammo loading, watching your back and helping your team mates out, in my experience most high level players stay away from forest area spawn events to concentrate on higher xp events, thats already the perfect arena for low levels.
---
Bethesda use this mechanic as a lazy way to increase difficulty as well as the ridiculously short time to loot after Earl is killed. It's all about making the event end game-ish and limiting farming, the whole game is being balance to make farming anything a pita.
---
it's not enough. Would say at least 3k and a decent backup weapon.
---
I have a TSE combat rifle - tired it on auto and would not recommend it. Breaks too quickly and recoil is nasty.
---
Now my Vampire's Automatic Handmade on the other hand .... mama mia. I love that gun.
---
Some advice if y'all hate reading, look up Earle on YouTube. There's streamers who've fought him on PTS. That's how you could prepare yourself visually for the fight.
---
Bloodied builds are irrelevant with regard the end timer, why not allow more time to loot what you killed, just a lazy mechanic.
---
Always bashing bloodied builds, this is so old.
---
I've done this in a group where there was 5 ppl under LVL 50. Lowest one was 17. Diddnt fail. It only taker 2-3 ppl in there group with good fps to complete in in a few minutes.
---
I run bloodied, was not trying to bash them. Just stating one of the draw backs.
---
Also the exit timer and the respawn timer are 2 separate issues. I wish we had more time to check out the mine.
---
Can you use it with the backpack?
---
This event... launch nuke join event wait... enter room die wait.... die wait..... die wait...... die wait....... die wait.......... boring and pointless so....
---
Fast Travel to camp and do some dailies.
---
They could’ve created challenge another way imo rather than the whole “oh you died x amount of times in a row? We’ll just bump up your respawn time each time” 
---
The event is fun and all. It just sucks because time spent waiting to respawn is time i could’ve used helping people fighting earl w me 🤷‍♀️
---
Yes you can
---
Usually everything inside a nuke acquires the glowing attribute. This was proven by the fact that there was a challenge to kill a glowing enemy in a nuke ,and you could comolete that even by killing a normal scorched grunt or a sbeast or anything else in a nuke. 
---
The ghouls in the burrow also becomes glowing,even tho there are no radiations down there when a nuke hits.
---
Now the colossus event is in instanced room so all this could easily be wasted words. But if there is any logic,they should also be glowing....they're are glowing green afterall ehe.
---
What’s stupid is that they fixed this by bringing back the “glitch”. Why not just make double sided walls a legit thing? They obviously know we want it, and are ok with us doing a glitch to make it work. Just make it a legit thing for crying out loud
---
I just don’t understand why people
---
Get so upset about this.  It’s a “survival” game.  Your base gets nuked.
---
What would they have done in the old days when anyone could come up and blow you base up at any time? (Lol kneeing while at your base whole time so no one would see you on map)
---
Ended up doing that when I saw it wasn’t gonna be a win. Just left and went to Graham’s meat cook lol, more rewarding!
---
I dropped one on atlas the other day to see if it would spawn like the sbq does. Nope gotta be touching the mine marker. You can miss fisure prime by a fair distance and you will still get scorched earth.
---
OK point taken, I just get fed up with so many constantly bashing on bloodied builds, it is part of the game, there are bloodied weapons in the game but people bash it as if it's an exploit.
---
Is this an exploit?
---
Mole miners. They have decent weapons and usually a handful.
---
Anti Armour is ALWAYS good. 
---
will need to unload a lot of ammo though.
---
Okay 
---
Thank you very much.
---
Should be called 'screw the collosus' event..
---
In my original post, I basically said any build type (“full heath, bloodied, [...] whatever”) shouldn’t be punished. I’m bloodied as well and know how to be very dodgy and avoid majority of attacks thrown my way in almost any circumstance - I know dying is more common with bloodied and try to avoid it as a result. But my point is general, not toward a specific build. Out of the 3 times I’ve done the colossal problem event, the third time is where I had the most trouble - swarmed by AI along with Earl while stuck in a frenzy and running over fire/acid just furthering damage. 
---
And it’s worse when you add on the respawn glitch - where your press x to respawn and it won’t let you or nothing, not even the vault, appears in the map. Among other bugs that can happen.
---
I miss fallout 4s survival mode. Enemies  deal more damage, but so do you. Adds challenge, but doesn't require  you to unload a minigun mag to kill a gutsy or two.
---
&gt;using a Tesla rifle and dropping your frame rate to 2FPS, and 20 flames per second coming out of your console/PC

There's your problem, and you can thank the wendigo spawns for that. As well as the people who are still using them ... put them away until they get fixed.
---
500 rounds hey.
---
BS
---
Just wait for the weapon nerf..should make this event more interesting!
---
Yes, but only if it sings when activated. Random singing would be like Daguerre's headaches all over again.
---
As I say, it's just lazy design, why not allow time to loot and another exit maybe that takes us through some interesting tunnels and other rooms as in Glass Cavern. Always the fall back on fast travel, there could be a lift back to the surface, I don't know just make more of the event.
---
The event is limited anyway to three every few hours, let us explore and have some fun.
---
Bethesda don't seem to like fun.
---
It's a fine line between knowing when to cut one's losses on something like this versus exercising successful, aggressive tenacity.  I'm just a mediocre player (but a huge fan of the franchise)...not sure how many of these will be doing.  Maybe if I can craft a Vampire Gauss Minigun.
---
But will anyone think of the screw economy?!
---
Everybody saying this isnt that bad. What?
---
 First try, I couldn't even get my weapin reloaded, I was getting smashed by so many Wendigo. I never once saw a round of 5.56 or shotgun shells looting my kills, and. We had 8 people lvl 99 or higher..... It was so buggy and glitch, i dont see how it can be won, honestly. 
---
Second try, burned through all my shotgun ammo, and I am down to 20 stim pals. Fuck this windigo asshole....OP as fuck
---
I almost think it shouldn’t be limited. 
---
I do however fear it’s a performance issue that it is and wonder how buggy the event would be with an entire server full. 
---
I love queen events when the entire server shows up, every now and again V9 becomes the equivalent of the workshop in Elden root or the old whitespring artisans corner before there was no reason to go there. 
---
Some great funny interactions there, especially with low levels and high levels coming together to build each other up.
---
Oh for sure. Bloodied is the boggy man in this game
---
Completely agree. Already find myself wishing certain aspects of the event could be different
---
Had a level 12 join in on our first time. I told him to leave, that they'd be a liability. Dude called me a cunt.
---
Like WTF? Got them communication banned. Can't be swearing .
---
As I witness your comments here, I need to ask, how often do you see these OP weapons? Are you sure they are Legacies, Hacked, or Magic and have confirmed exactly which type? Have you been reporting players with Hacked Weapons?
---
As a relatively new player it is a fair complaint that you find legacy weapons unfair, but I worry it is a sign of a growing disdain in new players toward more veteran players. The majority of longer players seem to hold the opinion that legacy weapons are only a problem because Bethesda is too reluctant to rebalance everything else to be better than it currently is. Many legacies can be sub-par to current easily obtained guns. If my Instagating Plasma Caster can one or two shot most enimies in the game and a Junkie's Gatling Plasma and my trash gun take similar amounts of time to kill the same enemy then should my non-legacy gun be removed too? It's important to ascertain if your complaint is more toward legacy weapons or the fact you don't have one dispite them being 'very easy' to get. There are legitimate balance concerns to be stated, there are multiple interests, but Bethesda has shown actual effort to be careful in its solutions to these complex problems. Calling for a full legacy weapon removal because someone used a power armor glitch and unknown possibly hacked and not legacy weapon to mess up an event isn't a fair response to players who actually value their legit weapons after supporting a contentious game through many bugs and issues newer players didn't have to suffer.

I use magic shotgun to kill the wendigos in 2 shots and as you said, they overwhelm me. I resorted to try a magic furious plasma gatling with 50%limb damage and it still is tough to kill while i die multiple times in pa and the mysterious stranger comes to back me up only for me to die again immediately. Although i haven't bothered to heal up because i rely om unyielding armor set to keep me below carryweight capacity
---
I can't remember, it's been too long, but yeah.  You may have to do that.   Try everything you can think of.   This questline is worth completing.
---
What did i just read?
---
So the perk is next to get nerfed
---
Jesus christ...what kind of monster makes something like that?
---
Yeah, I need to bulk-make some fusion cells before I dive in... gonna be a bit of a grind methinks
---
Scarecrow + turrets aimed on them
---
And as a result it's way better than it's first iteration. Although it was a pretty low bar to begin with admittedly.
---
I'm not holding my breath or anything, just hoping that continue on the path they're on.
---
It only sucks because you're unaccustomed to the dungeon layout. It's honestly a lot more simple than it looks. I'd rate the powerplants as more confusing dungeons, since they're all actually unique layouts over the silos, which are basically copy pasted dungeons, right down to the props in the dungeons.
---
It’s a blast of a event but I’m worried as hell how events like these and future ones are gonna go with the overall nerf coming our way.
---
I've heard it's if you're under 20% from rads. It thinks you're actively taking damage. Haven't tested it though.
---
I have no idea why people think it’s so hard
---
Hula bobblehead?
---
Each kill still took 6 hits with my 2★ bffr fixer.
---
After Earle dies you have to escape the mine which is the way you came in, as you get near to the exit there is a chest on the right hand side, that has the boss loot in it
---
Chally the moo moo and his poo poo 😎
---
First time I did it was with two other people, second time I Got to Solo it as no one was in my instance. I was actually hoping it would be harder, but I see people struggle with it and I’m just confused over it. I feel he is pretty easy if your character is set right.
---
Thats pretty funny.
---
Isn’t every game ever.... about playing in right?
---
I mean there is a whole thing called speed running........
---
Someone told me that if you take the bottom price on Fed76 and then cut it in half, you're closer to reality.   
---
The prices on legendary weapons have collapsed unless they are bloodied, junkied, FFR, FR, etc.   With the nerf coming up, AA and Furious may become more valuable.  I usesd to be able to charge $500 per star except for the most stupid stuff.   Now maybe half to two-thirds that?
---
Just did it for the first time then. 
---
Two shot gauss rifle in VATS with crits was making visible dents in the health bar which was nice. Used my fancy pump action to clean up wendigos. Did it without power armor.
---
Bit of slow down on PS4 Pro, but was a fun experience. Got the wendigo skin rug for a first go, so that was pretty cool. Hoping to get the plushie and helmet.
---
Doesn't have to be a survivor. Perhaps someone comes across a body the same way we do and goes through the "quest line" the same way we do. They then could "recruit" 76ers to carry on the good work..
---
Does it still do good damage without the scatter barrel?
---
But it does matter as that difference determines the problem as the more pressing and gratuitous has a more pressing need to be fixed.
---
You see the reason people don... wait no get of me help...
---
Yeah it’s the only part that makes it somewhat of a challenge.  Still easy if you have 4+ people who know what they are doing!
---
Does it still do good damage without the scatter barrel? What barrel would you recommend? Thanks
---
Do you mean a colossal problem?
---
That's why I'm hold on to my stuff and find new players and drop it in front of them. But they are more cautious than stray cats
---
No amount of armor mods or perk cards are gonna negate the op dmg of explosive energy weapon’s output. You will melt yourself every time. 
---
Scatter barrel mod greatly increases dmg, so it’s kind of a shame to take it off of an explosvie gp. 
---
Best thing to do is learn how to jump back (w/marsupial) and shoot. Try to get used to the spin up time of the weapon so that you can better time your shots. Give it some time and practice.
---
If all else fails, I can do you a favor and take that burden of a legacy off your hands (if you are on pc). But it’s kind of a huge favor so remember to be grateful to me if that happens ;)
---
Yeah sorry forgot to put that in
---
This is a pretty good idea 👍🏽👍🏽
---
The chest is right next to door with a few containers that respawn each time. Not much in the chest but i did get 500 caps out of it one time and a small amount of ores.
---
Not possible. Would have to give up two shot for anti armor
---
Be a socially responsible person and scrip your tesla to let everybody have stable FPS.
---
and a red dot. please
---
Well, yay fricking yay.    
---
My highest character and main is 110 and a solo Stealth Sniper. I don't have the gear for it nor is the playstyle remotely efficient for that. Great decisions BGS.
---
I really recommend you doing so at least. 
---
If you wanna be effective building up your character to reach a good end game setup, this is the way. 
---
But when that is said it’s all About just having fun. Play the way you want and feel like.
---
I literally started this quest last night. Has been fun so far
---
handmade rated 2nd!!!!
---
I am so TRIGGERED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
---
I picked this quest up like a year ago when 76 had it's free week during E3, and _still_ haven't done it. Maybe I should.
---
I went through like 199 stimpaks it was insane.
---
Main thing is that I dont want to sell a weapon like a 3* Bloodied Gat Plas (e.g) for too little and then lose out.
---
I look in a lot of peoples Vending machines and they want ridiculous money for guns and armor that I sell for scrip price, makes me feel as if I'm selling too cheap. Hence why I've been hoarding all my legendaries recently.
---
Sure, np. Im at work atm, but pm and i'll answer later
---
I did enough damage to the queen level 25-30 to get loot from here as a melee character, as you prob know melee can only do damage when she lands. I remember this because I made a new character for wastlanders and there was a 2x xp weekend, went in level 25 and came out level 30. That being said, I think there should be a level cap. High level events and areas gives you something to work towards. A sense of achievement.
---
This event is way too buggy for me to keep doing.  Up to at least 56 different bugs so far I have counted myself and still going.
---
Grind it out 'for you' or 'with' you...?
---
i can get behind that.
---
Have you heard the rat-a-tat-tat of an automatic no silencer handmade. Love it.
---
I've found shooting him repeatedly works.
---
I found circling the main square was my best option. Last one is didn't even see Earl got mobbed by mobs lol and someone killed him in second.
---
In a traditionally RPG series based around choice and variety there shouldn't be a absolute one-single way to play.
---
The games as always for Bethesda give you an illusion of choice but actually railhead you to a certain progression.
---
Seriously! Feeling disappointing aspect of it for me was that there wasn’t any part of the mission that had to do with that awesome training room in the manner. I would love an extension of this plot or more stuff that Hass to do with the order. Also, give me an order of mysteries bundle in the atomic shop please!
---
Certainly slower I agree lol, as a vanilla foodie build, I specialise in shotguns and heavy weapons, shotguns are useless against Earle but great against the Wendigo, and the Gatling Plasma I use does 10-22 damage a shot against Earle it gets his health down but it is slow, and currently you can't easily change spec mid battle.  
---
Now i'm gonna have to investigate the Gauss Minigun as my potential future Earle weapon.
---
I’ve been there 15min early to 15past numerous times and it didn’t trigger so
---
yes...BUT...we need a straight up 2 step confirm item trade system that does not require couriers.
---
I use the focused barrel and it has great range and still does more than enough damage to rip things apart
---
I'd be interested in seeing it too.  That event destroyed me yesterday as a bloodied.
---
Hard agree. The mistress of mystery was one of my favorite original quest lines. The way it was written actually made sense given there were no NPC originally. I have always thought there was the potential to build on it. The gear wasn't the best but the system of making it made sense and could have been used to model other quests on. In fact the way you upgrade the quest items should have been used for lots more items. You should be able to upgrade non quest gear the same way.
---
With me of course sorry
---
No worries, should be on in an hour or so. I'll make a post and tag you in it once it's done.
---
Jeez, really? It's only a few hours a day since launch. Gamepass in your case I assume?
---
I had a level 11 in one. Given the limited spots, someone leeching like that can really bugger off. Should be a level 50 requirement.
---
Word.
---
sorry man.
---
Unsure what platform you are on, but i play in a console group regularly, and have noticed base consoles/ s do tend to crash to dashboard so much more than the X.
---
I can't tell Sophia about it which is my biggest gripe.
---
The game's already easy, it's the grind that is the challenge. Take it as a gentle hint that you're doing something wrong.
---
The penalty is fine in my books - the game has no challenging content - there has to be something that makes a player attempt to get better gear / build a better perk deck / craft or buy meds. If you can just hurl yourself at a boss until it dies then what’s the point? It is supposed to be end game content, if you’re dying enough to get a 60s respawn timer then the answer may be to rethink your strategy, be it better gear/loadout/meds.
---
Not much of a fix but I notice the game will try and throw your team in with you so try and make sure your team are on the same wavelength on wanting to do it and not low level
---
It is on xbox
---
its not legacies its just lazy coding
---
*whispers* (maybe edit that word...)
---
He shall be expelled from the community, and can only returne if he gifts 1000 Stimpaks to new players, to make up for his crimes.
---
because generally gamers are whiny entitled brats?
---
Yes or magic shotgun
---
I use a junkies gatling gun, but when I use a .50 cal, i use final word. I've been looking for the right weapon, i just haven't found it yet. The gatling works for me, at the moment because i have like 25k 5mm. I don't buy them or craft them, they're just there.
---
I used to have a furious gatling plasma, but I really wasn't feeling it. Also a junkies ultracite gatling laser, which I found out, is a separate weapon from gatling lasers, with mods that can only be bought; it was also eating more cores than my power armor. I'd go into scorched earth with 12 cores: 2 for my pa, the rest for my weapon.
---
Ahem excuse my deleted comments I butt dial in Reddit so often these days.....
---
Have you tried rugs yet? Just say yes.
---
Most pun infested event we ever see.
---
I wouldn't; they don't sell nearly as fast as 308, 45, 556 and 50.
---
In my mind it's one of the best quest lines ever from Bethesda, in the same league as the Dark Brotherhood &amp; Thieves Guild one in the past.
---
Actually, any weapon over around 160 fire rate can produce magic effect. Closer to 200 you are the more effect you get. This happens as long as your frame rate in the game is around 60fps. Angry turtle made an updated video showing this.
---
Could you elaborate on where a new player can learn this power?
---
Yep, I've done this event twice. Both times I've died just before Earle, from a group 4-5 of normal wendigos chasing me around the cavern. Spawned straight outside. Hurts :(
---
Don't die. Heaven forbid you have to try not to die.
---
Also you did get rewarded, you just missed out on the corpse loot. You still get event legendary and loot.
---
CRYPTIDS
---
Yeah
---
Thx. So i can give up on getter a better MG than my 2shot explosive with prime receiver?
---
Agreed and I will go a step further. Bethesda add double sided walls 😃 please , a blank canvas that we can uses wall paper both sides!
---
If you leave, you're missing out on all those delicious screws and wendigo teeth. As long as you don't die, you'll get to keep all the loot and get teleported out at the end.
---
Just don't die.
---
I had me and a useless guy sponging and he goes down not too bad, never realised how awesome  psychotats are for it wish I can craft them
---
It always worked on my pc. Sometimes after a restart something works again and another thing is broken
---
i would like an alternative wave spawn of....
---
level 70 Mirelurk kings!!!
---
Now that's bringing the pain  :)
---
Ran two events today, one took only seven minutes and I landed the pickaxe, the second time we nearly ran out the clock and I got the plushie. All in all it’s a really fun event, look forward to more content like this! 🤞
---
They are everywhere. And the best pieces you have to craft. And after a quest you get a full ultracite.
---
Weird. And you can go to military wing of the enclave bunker no problem?
---
They are overreacting. As a lv 150ish non bloodied I can solo it with non magic guns and a lot of room for more dmg with my build with plenty of time to spare.
---
I honestly didn't think I could but the game stuck me in there solo so I gave it a shot and it wasn't that bad.
---
I've also been in there with 2-4 sub 50s and we still won without trouble so I don't think there's a scaling issue but I can't say for sure I guess
---
Nope PC only
---
lol. good luck with that
---
I was wondering about all of that cryo ammo I recovered, make sense now! 🤙
---
I'm not bloodied, but a basic melee scavenger. The thing that gets me the most in Colossal is getting surrounded by a horde of Wendigo.
---
So, yep, third person for me too. I need the extra visual prompts when somethings behind me, so I can sprint forward, turn and get my bearings, and not die under a pile of flailing Wendigo.
---
Kill lots of enemies and sell their weapons.   If you're lower level with any investment in strength, best to have a good melee weapon so that you don't have to worry about scrapping their stuff for steel to make ammo.   Empty that vending 1400 caps every day, even if you have to pick up trash and sell it.   Learn the cap runs (see youtube).  Equip Cap Collector.
---
Should save up some atoms and get the refrigerator box if you can, that thing has saved me some prime meat this week haha
---
You can get a small back pack plan in the motion town airport. The large back pack you are to do the tadpole challenges I believe.
---
The first time I only had a Non legendary sword left, and fougth for my life while trying to escape. Best feeling I ever had in this game
---
You can learn it from any tadpole coach etc (YouTube would be better then me) but you can start it from going to any CAMP (pioneer scout camp is NW from grafting damn) you just have to speak to the robot in the camp
---
To start the quest
---
It wasn't on
---
Baseball bat with heated coils.  :)
---
Take the W dude. You have a right to boast. What you did was smart and likely will help others in future.

---
I just concetrate on the little ones and keep them away from the high levels, then and only then, I take some shots at that nightmare.
---
Pacifist wasn't on
---
Are you serious?! I spent over 2k scrip now.... I would give my soul for it lol
---
Stay near the back wall, to the right from where you start, or spend most of your time in  the shaft you enter the event from. Almost no aoe damage there. Sneak works in the event, and the mobs only located me when I got hit with the fear attack.  You really don't need a ton of players to do it, just move around so you don't become the primary target.
---
I don't think glitching through the silo on your first run through is a good idea. The big reason to do so is because how repetitive it gets, also when you run the hole thing the right way you understand which doors go where.
---
Farm purified water and plant black berries. Got me to easily collect the 1400 per day :)
---
Follow the main quest. You’ll get the small backpack plans pretty early on by following responders questline. 
---
For larger backpack- you’ll need to read the pioneer scout poster in any train station to start that quest. Read the other two posters on the wall while you are at it.
---
This community is an amazing one. Everyone is kind and caring
---
The do if you are semi auto. If you throw an auto receiver on it you need commando perks
---
Hotdamn, Waterboy coach is here, no way.
---
How? U have to do the vault raid with both settlers and wanderers to 100% the game on xbox ( complete all their quests)
---
Cool thanks
---
The limits so many have complained about, myself included, are actually not limiting.
---
There is a whole game outside the scrip/cap/stash limts. Go find it.
---
Because it takes a long time and a shitload of stims if you’re not meta’d to hell and back
---
Yeah, that's my main gripe. It can get overwhelming. At one point I had at least 10 wendigos attacking me. I didn't stand a chance.
---
Just needs to be toned down a little.
---
I find myself dying lots if I position badly before the fears, I run bloodied and the amount of stims and Chems I use in there are well.. I’ve become familiar with holding an entire chemist in my inventory. 
---
The wendigos themselves aren’t too bad I’ve tanked pretty much 75% of the spawns most times 
---
What ends up getting me is if the colossus hits me then fears me into either the acid or the falling debris.
---
That debris hurts badly, I’ve made more of a habit standing back lately but if I use my plasma flamer i end up having to check what my back is facing quite a lot
---
It’s weird, they seem to only home in on me and no one else
---
Where do you get a camera?
---
Its like the queen in that his health makes mobs spawn, if you burn too quickly prepare for a sea of death coming your way XD was with a fella the 2nd time who had a good setup too as we got him down to second phase within 20 secs then stagger  hell was unleashed was nutd
---
Nope. It would be nice though.
---
Um... maybe you shouldn’t keep trying to brute force through events. Death should have consequences and be something you want to avoid. Why even be able to die if it doesn’t matter? Let’s just give everyone unlimited HP.
---
Didn’t read this comment but wrote practically the same exact thing
---
I won't be attempting this event until it's fixed.
---
high str stat. Then that boosted with unyielding. Food buffs, bobbleheads, Fury chem, mutations, weapon effects eg. + % 40 power attack damage.
---
it's crazy powerful....and you will love Mirelurk kings and Stingwings.
---
It's lime green on the bodies. The ore veins are bright yellow, same with the lasers. I see you enjoy trying to trigger me, but I'm not falling for it. Let's just say calibrations make it appear different and color is subjective and move on.
---
Damn this is a great idea, thanks. I'm bloodied and died about 10 times on my first attempt.
---
You need to create a Fallout76Custom.ini with the next content:
---
&gt;\[Enlighten\]  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;bEnableEnlighten = 0
---
Save it and then you just need to place it in Documents/My games/Fallout76
---
If this got added, I'd like to see a minimum level on the legendaries it happens with, perhaps level 40. I don't think new players fighting legendaries that suddenly turn invisible or become invincible unless you melee them would be very fair on those players - there's enough the game doesn't explain very well, and getting killed by something because you didn't know you had to melee it seems like a recipe for ragequits.
---
Man its really taking us a while to kill this guy. Oh yea everyone keeps dying to the wendigo spawns. Oopsies!
---
Top tip!
---
Carnivore mutation. It makes those melee %dmg meats op.
---
Honestly the event was a disappointment, I've run its 3 times now only died twice in the first attempt, I was on my weapons mule so my armour is unyielding with  WWR. Just found a spot in the center to jump on and stayed there for the entire event, no damage, no stupid wendingo scream, I was hoping the event would be more challenging.
---
Base consoles are showing their age.
---
Haha sort of had this happen at colossal problem, my friend and I were in chally suits and some guy got on the mic calling us a couple of sissy boys and generally being rude. Well he was the first guy down and I did the mothman dance on him rather than reviving him.
---
Except every group i join , there are people who 1 shot everything. There is no challenge.
---
Radiation rumble for example, no one does the objective just stays for experience and loot. Line in the sand, feels like a bot-farming zone with bugging out enemies. There is no point, thankfully private worlds exists, but i like social aspects of this game. 
---
This might be my last month of 76
---
......you message a dude calling him a liability.... And to leave a public event in a public world... And then you got him comm banned.....
---
Sure, his language was bad but I don't think you're in the right.
---
TODDlers
---
Not bad at all! Beats the missile launchers beckett keeps giving me!
---
**Earle**: 32k HP, 400 DR, 400 ER, 500 RR, Ignores 80% of all incoming damage, immune to radiation and explosions.
---
**SBQ**: 32k HP, 300 DR, 300 ER, 300 RR, Ignores 70% of all incoming damage, immune to radiation and explosions
---
Earle is effectively 67% tougher than the SBQ (Example: basic 50 Cal, no buffs, SBQ: 3.17 dmg/shot, Earle: 1.9 dmg/shot).
---
The first explosive weapon I ever had drop in 2018 was an explosive laser (level 30). I was so excited. It kinda sucks but is one of the only weapons I still have from launch. It sits in my stash. You think it should be taken from me when I did nothing wrong?
---
Nah, I don’t buy it. It’s victim blaming. Expecting everyone to be familiar with some esoteric set of ‘rules’ for the event to work without a hitch. You have to remember most players don’t read this sub. If the fences are really that much of a problem, and Bethesda can’t work the A.I around it, then remove them. Similarly, just make the SBQ immune to the stagger perk. They found it easy enough to make her wings immune to, well, everything.
---
That's weird
---
5.56, 0.50 cal, 5mm
---
I'm gonna sound like a downer, but I rushed through it hoping it would be over, so I can move on to the good ones. 
---
They should have kept the comic book theme in the background, while focusing more on stories like senator Blackwell's. To me, whacky should stay whacky, not turn into a paternal drama.
---
The Pulowski secret entrance was cool though.
---
If you're not using some combo of blocker, dodgy, and serendipity, those really help w the little wendigos. They were killing me nonstop the first few times but I put on all 3 of those and now the only thing killing me is falling ceiling rocks!
---
SBQ has 32000 HP, upfront 70% damage reduction and 300 DR/ER. She does not scale with the number of players in the event, although there is a bug where, if you're in a group, it shows you in \[Caution\], and the damage floaters display the numbers for stealth crits, but you actually only do normal damage without stealth bonuses.
---
AFAIK, Earle has 32000 HP, 80% upfront damage reduction and 400 DR/ER. I would assume that like the SBQ he doesn't scale.
---
It does damage?
---
Never noticed it.
---
I don't mind the low levels however after getting a few hits on Ernie for loot they should help out and aggro the spawns so the real damage dealers can go to town without the staggers,
---
The down votes without any reasons I found tells otherwise...
---
I switch between the two depending on ammo. Commando is really fun, but my main is and always has been a rifleman (rifles should either get more damage or a buff to armour penetration though, jeezo!)
---
Nukes and dragons should have them
---
I've found that my PA tank build with Vampire minigun is perfect for this event. I can take aggro from the Wendigos and Earl and keep them centered around me. The Vampire minigun will keep me alive as long as the wendigos do not stagger me too much and I can keep my lead flying.
---
Done it about dozen times and have had zero failures or deaths so far. Those will come as the scent of a new event fades away slowly.
---
If you have VATS build then target Wendigos legs and immobilize them as soon as they spawn. There is almost no use to trying legs of Earl as he doesn't slow down much, but he is easy to avoid.
---
This is much nicer group event than to SBQ and totally understand the limit of 8 people. 
---
For best loot, do not run out when Earl dies, just stay in the cavern and kill/loot all the Wendigos. You will be ported outside with all your loot/junk/rewards when the timer runs out. You will miss out on the extra 100-500 cap reward from the special loot box, but looting Wendigos will give you back some of the ammo you have used in the event, so in my opinion that is better than few hundred caps.
---
wait 5 minutes before going in. They will be there all glowing and shambling.
---
They don't.
---
If they made magic weapons legacy because they can't fix the bug, the people who cry for them to be removed would be creaming their pants. They just want something valuable to show off and trade. The fact magic weapons generally out perform legacies and are so common gives such delicious salt. They should remove both but start with legacies.
---
Wow. Timing is everything!
---
I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. They are being a douche out of ignorance. But one shotting everything is being a douche wilfully.
---
It's not meat piles. I've been at LITS and had mountains of meat piles with zero FPS impact. 
---
Throw a Tesla in and my FPS goes to shit.
---
I made a call to stay with a bunch of lowbies, too. It was miserable. Next time I'm in that position I totally gonna bail on them. I disagree on limiting the event based on level, though.
---
Oh , never thought about that 
---
Thanks man
---
Yes, please.
---
Tired of the picks and shovels yet.
---
If the event wasn't an instanced one, I wouldn't mind. Have all the people you want join. 
---
But otherwise it's just a space someone more experienced could be using. I'm all for having more people around. Hell I did the Queen at Level 30 (got invited by a hiiiigh level) but otherwise it just feels like a wasted gun.. 
---
Got nothing against low levels or new players.. But maaaaybe these instanced ones should be level locked, at least.
---
The timer on prime meat is too strict to share! We fail if we let people get hits in!
---
It’s not fire so I would think not, I never even noticed any damage from the screams unless earl made me run screaming into a giant drill/acid/fire pit thing
---
You’re guaranteed one during the base game storyline, scroll down to the “locations” section 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gatling_gun
---
Yes pal I traded it for a explosive flamer, minigun and some other goodies
---
No because his level won't scale down that far, and everyone's guns will be nerfed to all hell!
---
I've killed 34 wanted players and they show as hostile by default.  If you have Pacifist off then they can be killed no bother (unless in god mode and unkillable). At least that is how it has worked for me, including a few days ago.
---
I been lucky to get a piece of armour that has chance to lower damage while moving and another that does the same while standing still and I survive accidentally taking myself out about 70%of the time
---
If your on pc a friend got a junkies 50 limb damage plus another perk I can remember one .
---
I soloed the bastard last week (using a J25 Ultracite Gatling Laser and a fuckton of stims), and the toughest part were the adds. Between the staggering and hearing that scream over and over again, I was on my last nerve.
---
Oh, and when I got out of the mine, there were 3 people just chilling outside. They had never been inside, so I'm not sure if they were just trying to get the rewards or whatever.
---
More often than not, you can not jump when you've been staggered.
---
Unless I was getting hit by something I couldn't see, I was screamed to death by a wendigo spawn.
---
One thing I ask is, 'where's Frederick Rivers?'
---
Got the curse harpoon gun even though I died on the way out and spawned in the aluminum bunker outside
---
Your going to melt yourself. That is a fact of life. I gave fireproof 3 and a decked out xo1. Miss judge the range, clip a door way, not notice a railing.....pile of gooo. 
---
Best bet is to use the GP in open areas and a different gun in close quarters. Also learn to jump or run away to get spacing. I also use my jet pack to fly up and then carpet bomb the target. 
---
All that said, I goo myself from full health quite often. Can’t imagine how often this would happen with a BE GP.
---
There really isn't that many situations or they don't occur often enough where I'd be cursing because some level 800 is hoarding all the loot in my opnion. It's just, if a person doesn't try to actively deal dmg, don't expect people to wait for you 🤔 I mean, prime meat for example, you have to move quick. If you wanna get the prime meat itself which is 5 scrip. Same amount if you waited everyone to slap a one star mole rat that's runing around.
---
That's why you jump constantly, that way you don't get hit.
---
Adamantium skeleton does most definitely help with staggering, have personally tested it in multiple situations and multiple weapons . It will not negate staggering but will reduce the severity
---
Bet, I think I can make 50 cal rounds, ill have to check
---
Bet!
---
Are you in first or third person camera? I heard stagger is a lot less for first person. (I haven’t done the event yet so can’t comment from experience though)
---
Well imo your post is pretty dumb
---
Unfortunately on ps4 damn haha. But thank for the offer :)
---
I always buy out .45 5.56 and .308 when I have the caps..usually 90%of the time
---
I dunno about this one. How would it work on consoles? And I think it would eliminate a lot of the searching for loot or scrap because you'd just walk into a room and instantly just hit that key and see whatever is around. Just my op
---
No reason if the event doesn't have a number of players limit. Nobody is hurting anyone.
---
I agree! The amount of times we failed the event because people waited 3 mins for everyone to slap the legendary, then loot it and look at it, just made the event fail entirely. Plus prime meat itself, unlike the 1 star nucturnal mingun which has a limit of 150 scrip per day, doesn't have a limit. The meat is far more valuable!
---
Disagree with the story line thing, but agree with the level cap. My heavy alt is lvl 250 and hasn’t completed all of the main story
---
It's useful to have one person running around cleaning all the wendigo spawns up. I usually take this role, and it works great for the team.
---
The Caution bug (feature?) Is the same with Earle. I've been doing runs with a group of Sneak Bloodied Commado builds. When we attempted runs with mixed groups, are damage numbers were still showing ~350/shot but the actual damage was closer to what I would expect if Sneak Mult wasn't working. ~97/shot.
---
Not viable when you play PvE, and need your action points for vats. let alone jumping when in vats.
---
Play how you like.were only playing this till we get bored.if you like heavy run that.hell if you want to roleplay as jason...do that I swap between rifleman and commando have 4 to 5 cards burned on each jist so I dont have to swap
---
Stop standing in the fire 😂
---
Bet, so far 556, 45 and maybe 5mm seem to be the most wanted
---
I had the game at launch on ps4, I've got a level 160+ character with some mules as there was no vending and a 40o stash limit at the time. I don't have a ps4 anymore but that account has numerous legacy weapons and tonnes of good shit. Gutted I codnt take the accounts over to pc
---
Lol
---
To me .50 and 5mm are so cheap to make so I dont buy them but every one has that gun they keep fed.
---
When I was low level doing uranium fever for the first time, a lvl 400+ player waved me over after the event and dropped a bag full of junk legendaries for me. Nothing useful but got me started on my scrip bank account! It’s appreciated!
---
Same here. All my magic weapons do practically nothing to Earle while they melt everything else outside. I get up to 25 fps in the cave which could be the reason magic don't work.
---
meaning you are not able to understand the post, or you are just do not like any proposed ideas in the post? Dumb is a very abstract term does not help in progress.
---
Exactly, I don't really want for much anymore. So lower levels will get more use out of it whether they use it or scrip it.
---
Chances are, once they come out with the new instanced camp interiors that we will be able to add to our camps, we will have the ability to go crazy decorating. Which will probably include the ability to put junk anywhere we want.
---
Imagine having a holotape that lets you log into chat to use it actively, while having a hud element that displays messages in the background. That would be so awesome.
---
I have the exact same gun. I put a tweaked reciever and preforating w a suppressor
---
w mister sandman at night an covert ops
---
its a fun fun gun
---
I did it too as a male character. Just stumbled upon it one day without realizing it. I had the “Veil”, but no idea what it was until I discovered the Mansion at random. 
---
I would a DLC that maybe included the Children of The Unstoppables. Where either parents (rest of the OG Unstoppables) lost communication with the Mistress of Mystery and sent their kids to find her, or maybe a lost holotape that asks “if anyone finds this holotape, rebuild the Unstoppables and carry on the work”. Then you can pick your favorite character that’ll match you build. 
---
Just a thought, but I think it would be fun and a hell of a QUESTLINE!!
---
It's not a thing because of consoles. They've actually come out and admitted it before that a majority of the people playing this game are somehow on consoles and since console players are apparantly more likely to have mics but not have access to keyboards it hasn't been a priority.
---
This is my second one. My other one is meant for just ripping through anyone in front of me. I modified this one for playing at a little more of a distance.
---
no, it's doesn't have list of legendary perks yet.
---
I’m not the one using it. I don’t even have one anymore!
---
Don’t we kind of have that with the public team bonuses. Events teams tend to be for people who grind events as a group. Building is for players who want to play solo but get team benefits. Other bonuses are for people who failed to click events or building.
---
Why better PC? That thing can run on a $100 laptop.
---
I missed all except 2, funny thing is I was excited for both events but I just grew tierd waiting. Might be back for season 2 or maybe Im gone forever. 🤷
---
I totally get this, I'm only level 35 and only do events I know I can pull my own weight in. People who join events higher than their pay grade are just leeches imo
---
I might be getting the game soon, I’ll let you know if I do!
---
One of the things I was struggling with was my tse lever action breaking. Ts weaps are notorious for breaking super fast, even with the right perks, and I ended up having to repair my gun twice for one event, which is frustrating as the weapon bench is a little way back.
---
Ya ive made the mistake at shooting radscorps right in front of me killing myself in the process.
---
I do love it tho. That an my TSE .44
---
Im mostly unarmed build but i love those two
---
I was just on it and yes it does. Think the costs are not up to date though.
---
If you had ps plus, they should’ve automatically saved to your account and you just have to go into your settings and download the data again. If you were account sharing, there’s a small chance it may not have worked but usually it does - it may also just be saved to the servers
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks/ammo-factory
---
I lost out on 6 days worth and 3 weeklies, they just lock the ticket immediately without response.
---
Bethesda sees the double score as "we good". Even though they auto complete too!
---
Well just the current game.
---
But that shouldn’t matter commando vs rifleman because they would all add up the same
---
You interested in BoS RP mate? If you are, I'm part of an all platform RP group actively trying to recruit more PS4 members. DM me for more information.
---
I hear ya - traded mine in for scrip
---
Other than punishing you for not optimizing your gameplay. Is it really something you should complain about?
---
I don't think low level join ACP out of spite. I do think a lot of people oneshot legendaries out of spite, is what I'm getting at.
---
It's not a list and it's not up to date.
---
I was account sharing with my brother so ps plus cloud service is a no go unfortunately, fingers crossed its saved to there servers thanks for your reply!
---
Yeah, I have had to run away because I've been able to absolutely shred my health bar with a mix of Commando and Dem. Expert.
---
"attractive and impressive through being richly colorful or sumptuous"
---
They do. But they get destroyed fairly easily
---
Wish I could say that about my camp at the Whitespring... 😬
---
Damn that's sad 
---
All the nice stuff gone lol...
---
Good luck man! I know that at least with most of my online mmo type games, the characters have typically saved to the servers not my hard drive.
---
Damn thats half the whole score season for weeklies
---
But now that we can swap back again, make the wall a doorway or solid, paper it, then change it back.
---
I'm not surprised. The usual combat stealth logic is that you cannot be in stealth with regard to a mob that is in an open fight with anything. If only one guy in that group is in an open fight, no-one in the group gets stealth bonuses. Which would mean that the bug is the client thinking you're in stealth when you shouldn't be.
---
If it results in a guaranteed 3* drop, I'm in.
---
What perks is it missing? I believe the cost is the only thing that is no longer correct
---
Good lol...
---
If I ever change bank so it's not listed to me anymore ill send you the login details haha.
---
Yeah same here I used to play eso and that was all server based so really hoping it's the same for fallout, thanks again!
---
Child's play. I got stuck in a small group of sub 50. Noticed we couldn't kill in about 5 minutes in. 270 screws from farming xD
---
I can finally tell a tesla runner how I feel about those pixelated clouds of shit the tesla rifle creates on use as of lately. What a special place in my heart you people have. 
---
My 60 fps says HI!
---
Yeah, had the same problem with my TSE combat. I have loads of repair kits, mostly from the SBQ - saves the trip.
---
You're right (at least I think, since I can't check it now), list is there, only upgrade costs aren't up to date.
---
After Lv50 everyone is the same
---
Did it twice last night myself. I didn't get any plans yet, but it was a lot of fun.  Didn't die in the first go, but I fear ran into the drill the second time, and got mauled by some wendigo spawns. 
---
I did however get a cursed pickaxe - bloodied, reduced weight, 40% more power attach damage. I'm not bloodied, but that seems like a decent melee. Maybe?
---
Yeah pacifist wasnt even on it just decided he was untouchable by the law unless he agreed
---
Where is this spot? I couldn't find anything.
---
I went when I was level 20. It worked out pretty well. You just need to play differently. Meaning: Do not try to be standing out in front of wendies, throw lots nades, touch every wendies you can, dying is ok seriously, help revive others, stay alive while running out of the tunnel, oh yea and know where the exit is (you will sometimes see a good player waving to indicate where to run).
---
That's all, its not that hard if you have couple high levels with you, 100+ should work.
---
I used rugs once.can you place random junk on rugs?never tried that
---
My pc can just about run Chrome lol
---
Wouldn't that be awesome in real life eh? Lol ... Sorry officer, I decline 🤓
---
been like that since the early days and the first known duping methods. That's why people ask Bethesda to ban those dupers but we've seen in their last "ban" wave the duper's money is still more valuable to Bethesda.
---
An attempt was made.
---
Do you know the updated cost? I saw it on a vid but can't remember. And am not having any luck googleing it
---
stop being stupid
---
FWIW, Grahm dropped me a hunters secret service arm last night.
---
In this context, I used the term perk very loosely, and perhaps incorrectly.  ”perks” = stars and whatever effect those stars represent. 
---
AFAIK, you can only scrip SS gear - no trade or sell.
---
Man I wish I could go rob a store, kill 2 people and say no thanks I don't consent to the cops and get off Scott free.
---
"So you don't have to help"? Dude you can just beat on a drum or spin a spit while reading reddit, it's not like helping the event is hard or even takes effort. Showing up early for a spot on one of those IS the best way to put in no real effort lol  
---
And yeah, it's on the hour, in a game that's easy to lose track of time and doesn't have an in game clock. There's a reason they have the notifications. But if you want to blame \*me\* because I don't always notice right away when I'm affected by a subtle bug (that shouldn't even exist), sure.
---
Been rocking a 1star instigating lever action for the last 100 levels. With the most basic of builds it's a 1tap to anything just short of a high level super mutant. Super easy to just swap out rifleman for commando when heading to tougher areas when real dps is needed.
---
Then launch it yourself. Nukacrypt.com has the week’s nuke code within 20 minutes of them changing.
---
50 -&gt; 100 -&gt; 150 if I remember correctly
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning
---
Reminder that the armor that you build from the plans in question isn’t sellable or tradable, so be prepared to grind a lot of legendary modules and feed a lot of armor back to the Purveyor if you’re looking for a particular legendary roll.
---
I have never duped or cheated but I have traded my way to three legacies now, needless to say I would be fucking raging if my weapons were taken.
---
Becuase thats exactly what they are "clueless". Im almost certainly convinced the DEV team is just a bunch of hamsters on exercise wheels.
---
[PS4 player here ]
---
It is way more stable that it has been. But it is still a lil unstable. We have a lot of framedrops and sometime it pushes you to quit and relog to "patch" the issue. We still have alot of this type of lil bug here and there forcing us to relog to temporarily fix the issue. But it's definitely getting better. Devs are definitly showing us that they are absolutly not giving up on this game.
---
On PC, your main issue is that you will have to deal with hackers, duppers and magic weapons ( cheated weapons / overpowered weapons ).
---
So think about it twice.
---
I saw AngryTurtle and 1 other person take Earl out in just a few minutes. Just the 2 of them. It was crazy.
---
It's no surprise when the Powerful Automatic Receiver of most(all??) Rifles has almost the same damage as the Hardened Receiver but with a significantly higher RoF. 
---
I know that in Fallout 4 it was the other way around and semi-autos/bolt action were so much better than full automatic, but they could at least add a weaker version of the Advanced Receiver that most Rifles had.
---
Even if some perk cards like Tormentor/Tank Killer/Concentrated Fire have a higher % with non-auto, it's still not meaningful enough to justify the drop in DPS.
---
Progress is all saved server side
---
Yesterday, doing the event with my friend there were 2 low-levels (4 players in total). One level 8 in a cow suit, another 21 with a shotgun. The first one did nothing, just ran from side to side, often dying. The second one at least  tried (unsuccessfully). My friend and I were able to successfully complete the event together. We spent a bunch of ammo.   
---
The most hilarious thing is that the level 8 player got that rare mask at the end without doing anything.
---
that would be awesome. We need more challenge..
---
Because you are getting rewarded for it? The actual drop on him is just standard legendary fodder and from my experience isn't even a guaranteed three star. It's the event itself that drops a guaranteed three star and the mission rewards right into your inventory.
---
Sounds right. I feel like it was 200 to max one
---
Either a full group of Bloodied or Legacies. Or one or two people with Magic Weapons, pretty much.
---
I think Beth should really value such grow in 1.5 years and nurturing it. Regardless all the bugs and grinds, player base still strong its a very good sign, I just hope the company get away from just milking the cow without feeding it good ... "content". A happy cow is a good cow that makes milk.... somehow? if that even makes sense -\_-
---
Event rewards need to be handed once Earl is dead.  So much crashing during loading screens.  And this was before this event.
---
B2525 fixer or hm
---
Well, everything above 50-60 should be fine. But gotta ask...fusion cells? oO
---
It's about 2k less than SBQ, to put it in perspective.
---
By main quest are we referring to the overseer? Im getting so caught up exploring haha
---
That was before wastelanders and the steam migration. I remember this from the Q&amp;A or whatever they did. Despite all the requests for it, they still cited it's a low priority for whatever reason.
---
I was alive when he died. His body just vanished and my FPS were to the end of the event so low it was basically a diashow. Couldn't loot his boody and by running out I lose somehow HP without any source and died.
---
The SBQ. Earle has higher resistances and ignores more damage so about 67% tougher than the SBQ.
---
*Example*: Primed F10 50 Cal, SBQ in the head, 32 dmg/shot, dies after 1500 rounds. Same gun, Earle, 20 dmg/shot, should to die after 2400 rounds but refused to.
---
It's good change, I used all my spare cards, perk cards packs and spare levels on lvl640 character on the first day of PTS, before the change, so I can't change it back. But 300 coins instead of 450 coins is huge difference.
---
Awesome!! Thanks for your reply :)
---
Yes. It’s very early on in &gt;!morgantown airport!&lt;
---
I didn't even get to that point.
---
Did most of the damage to him, got him down to \~25% Health, and I got hit with the Auto-Fire bug from too many effects happening, and my game crashed.
---
Please at least put the tesla rifle away at public events. Everyone else will drop below 5FPS.
---
Because everything they ~~can actually manage to~~ do can and will be exploited. Just picture hundreds of players intentionally crashing (or whatever kind of force-exit that might work) before the end of the event if they got a trashroll 3* from Earl? I mean every drop would have a value that determines if it was worth the ammo and meds spent, right?
---
The exploiters will find a way. Between the clearly incapable devs who are well and truly out of their depth, and the exploiters who will abuse anything for their own benefit, we have no chance of getting high-end features like this.
---
But it's "not hurting anyone" right Robin Hoods? 🙄
---
If you can fast travel on a person who's inside the event (in a team with you, or a friend) then you can get back in.
---
It's not 100% consistent - sometimes you'll spawn outside st the mine first - but I've been able to get back on every time I wanted to.
---
Je laser, shoot at his feet and legs, dunno why it works it just does.
---
I missed it as well, but it was because my game crashed
---
Yeah I use a vampire's gauss minigun so I'm practically indestructible, but when I've got 5 or 6 wendigos hammering away at me while reloading &amp; spinning up, it is squeaky bum time.
---
I still haven't completed the event because:
---
- some players are just AFKing
---
- some players are just tagging the wendigo spawns and collecting screws
---
- some players are just running around, avoiding damage, and waiting for others to waste their ammo killing Earl
---
- some players simply decide to leave once they realize that others are taking the same lazy approach to the event as they are
---
My thoughts, Bethesda should automatically group similar level players when they log in. I’ve started a new character to play along with my son and daughter whenever they play and it’s almost intimidating when you’re like, lvl 15 and someone that’s lvl 230 comes around.
---
No mate, most  builds aren't completed until at least level 80 &amp; then most still have crap gear
---
Now that sounds awesome lol.
---
I would really appreciate it haha
---
Happened to me at one violent night, just me and one other player, I spent the entire time putting my power armour in the doorway and playing the drums. Other person was killing the stuff blocked by power armour. Great teamwork... Or so I thought, just as the wendigo is about to spawn I stop playing drums and pick up my armour, switch to my rifle so not to one shot it and this dude just drops the thing before I can even aim...
---
Karma came in the form of a nuclear missile that my friend doing the silo at the time diverted to his camp... I bitches about the player but didn't notice, neither did the other player... Until touch down.
---
Doesn’t need a buff. With a suppressor it would easily out dps handmades and fixers.
---
Although in real life your rifles are for longer range engagements. You’re going to use an automatic M4 over a semi automatic M4 to clear a building or to fight a group for example. But for distance, semi automatic is better because you’re getting more control out of a semiautomatic.
---
I’m level 42 and just steer clear of events so I don’t piss the higher levels off.
---
The dead tourist has it, and starts the camera quest line. I believe the personal terminal will still give you his location
---
I'd be interested too. My bloodied had their ass handed to them, but my full-health build kicked ass.
---
Running a BE heavy with Emergency protocols on a Sh PA, you survive 2 hits. The whole 2 hits, the third melts you. Hahaha
---
I use this exact weapon, and he still feels pretty tanky.
---
And melee is better than both for anything like a boss or Mirelurk Queen.
---
Much appreciated my dude, noticed your on xbox, if you drop your gt i promise not to be irritating 😂
---
Was it you who blew up my camp?
---
I don't know - we managed to 3 man it in 12 seconds without exploits, using Bloodied stealth commando builds and b2525 fixers - Proof:  
---

---
Jokes on you, I’m a filthy casual who doesn’t even do the main story. *dabs and breaks neck*
---
I can only trigger her or Beckett's "daily" every two to three days.
---
Everytime I've died it has been the bloody environment. Usually the flaming ceiling timbers caught me unaware right in midst of the firefight. I can survive all explosions or explosive weapons with dense SS armor. Might have to see if Fireproof solves this issue. Though now that I have all the unique rewards the cost of the event doesn't really justify doing it anymore.
---
Just not with VATS - you'll usually miss
---
I hate high level players who do this. It's so frustrating. We get it, you can destroy high level legendaries in 2 seconds. Gets more frustrating when you land a hit in the enemy, damage appears but you still don't get tagged for the kill. The loot dropped is likely useless to them when it might be really good for a level 50
---
Well then you’ll love my camp! I’m always selling 10k+ 5.56!
---
If you have the plan you go to the armor workbench go to your backpack in modify/repair and go to the skin sub-section
---
What it boils down to, is that I've written off this Event as pointless.
---
Already got all the plans, the gas mask, and the Harpoon Gun. I have no reason to run it ever again.
---
Same as Encryptid. Same as Project Paradise. Great potential for End game content ruined because the entire Dev combined aren't even as competent as a single person in an actual Professional studio.
---
Yeah. I just don't like MMOs. And the absence of chat makes me feel a little bit less MMO. I know that everyone will benefit from a chat and I hope they add it. But I'd like to hide it completely too.
---
On the other hand, the grind, daily limits and that battle pass thing... Well. That's quite MMO.
---
Tissue paper is a little bit of an upgrade for the game isn't it?  At least tissue paper has some durability.
---
I sell all my ammo for 1c. I once went to a camp who was selling their .45 and 5.56 for 5c a piece. It made me cringe 😬
---
Only awarded for events marked with exclamation marks !  :-)
---
I disagree, first time ever doing colossal problem it was just me and my Lv39 brother because nobody else in the server showed up to help. We actually finished the event with 10 minutes to spare, if anything he was real helpful by drawing it’s attention from me and reviving me if a cheeky windigo spawn ambushed me. As long as there was communication and they know what to do it’s fine. As long as you have a good build and are competent in your own skill set, you can kill Earl while everyone else acts draws his attention. Actually reminds me of a scene from a show I watched...
---
“You guys were adequate meat shields, and nobody can take that from you.”
---
“Hey you’re not better than us!”
---
“*Equips apparel item that dropped for killing the boss* My sweet ass coat begs to differ.” 
---
“...Damnit he’s got us there.”
---
That is really annoying problem all the time, they should prioritize the event icon on top of the player icons
---
I play first person. If that is true, stagger must be horrible in third person!
---
Play the event on xbox yesterday it ran great. My only complaint is the respawning timer as you near the end 60 sec. Seems a bit long cost me looting the boss. But great event just the same.
---
not just that, consoles have a built in text chat feature, you can message anyone in game through your xbox or playstation
---
I have many "magic" guns and of course I wanted to try them out on Earle. I think many players are just testing their weaponry, magic or not.  
---
I hope and think use of magic guns will decrease the coming days until the majority of the playerbase has tested out their weapons.
---
So in a week or so, I hope we get back to common decency dictating **you do not melt Earle/the SBQ if you didn't launch the nuke**. But there will always be selfish people that do...
---
I went in lvl 151 with my explosive shotgun at full health towards the end had to switch guns cause it broke and i had 5 others in the event with me so be fully perpared
---
It’ll just be full of dudes trying to get and sell their “one of a kind” 3 star explosive junkie stuff
---
I probably have a couple of rifles too
---
Its still fun otherwise mostly in part do to the "players". If it was a single person game id say spend your cash on something else. The game becomes generic at a certain point and theyre obviously designing it around what mobile games do to keep the player base logging in everyday. The only reason ive stuck around is because the community is so fucking spectacular. Im hoping the next couple months changes it that and we get more quality content like wastelanders.
---
This might work but my main doesn't use mutations cause she's boring like that! Have to try with alt, thanks for the idea!
---
If you’re on PC and get put in with the Aussies and Asians there’s a very high possibility if it happened within the last 14 hours that it was indeed me xD
---
Idk i run with two other people and we kill it in 4minutes or less everytime and half the reason it takes us that long is cause we're looting the baby earls for ammo 😂
---
Pff, I Love Sofia, she gave me B/E/FMS Handmade on her first daily. She may bitching in my camp as much as she wants
---
They do drop occasionally, and mostly disproportionately. I tried my Primed Gatling Gun on them and for a couple of shots they rewarded me with 50-70 ultracite 5mm.
---
Ok I have both of them , I thought handmade and fixer had a fire rate not worth it.
---
Well, now...isn’t that the mystery? ;)
---
I still have the mask but no longer have access to the bunker, and yes I do put it on!
---
I don’t even pay attention to Earle unless there’s no wendys running about. I make sure everyone is safe from those ugly bastards. Got my vamp 50cal to keep me alive mowin down adds while the other guys focus on ol Williams. Seems to work out nicely as I haven’t failed the event yet after 4 times
---
The magic ones are pretty good , blimb minigun etc.
---
Yeah.. I whacked the wendigo spawns while my team handle the colossal. But I will still need to score some hits otherwise I will get nothing
---
No. 
---
Firstly the netcode is crap, so the wendigos will just swipe your ass in the air and then you’ll get staggered and will be unable to jump again.
---
Secondly, the roof is deadly, with dot splooge and rocks falling. Not a viable tactic in that setting.
---
Legendary enemies and/or crowned enemies should have these mutations anyway. Would make the fights challenging from the start. I often kill legendaries before they mutate
---
I tried the event with pneumatic torso, Adamantium skeleton and Blocker. Much better experience!
---
Any idea about the gun type they used ? Heavy, flamer ,fixer ?
---
I mostly agree with that statement, assuming you can avoid dying that is. 
---
Bloodied melee still obliterates stuff but you have to be on foot touching the boss (and all the little adds attacking too) and staying alive with less than 20% health.
---
However, I do have a bloodied melee char for this reason
---
How DARE he sully the name of Chally!
---
1st nuke at 401?... I started nuking around lvl 100, at that point the game was getting intensly repeatative. You must really enjoy the gameplay.. I envy your tenacity my friend.
---
My first attempt was pretty much solo. Jump on it a tad late so had my own instant. Only one other lv60 dude in PA and using a chain saw! Lol
---
Still beat em tho. Not a quick kill but very doable. Def was more fun the next time around with a full team of 8. Shit gets nuts at the end with the spawns lol
---
I always forget mine until I hear the sound. My wife is ocd about health. Even if a little bit is missing, "don't forget to heal"... Doesn't matter if I'm getting my ass handed to me as long as she sees my health go up.
---
Nuka Cola Quantums are an amazing thing you know. Throw on Cola Nut and you have the backbone of immortality.
---
May have to try this. Thanks for the tip!
---
What do you mean? You need higher fps for it to work? I didn't notice what I got in there but as I play suuuper widescreen (5760 x 1080) that's not good news for me. I only bump 60fps on occasion outside. GTX1080.
---
One used a b2525 hm same as me and one used a be flamer, we all chunk its damage around the same tho
---
That's the thing--Earles easier than the sea of Wendigo imo. I'll never go semi auto in there again.... Fuck my trigger finger is tired lololol
---
They should add it like a little faction, with dailies and stuff like that. It was a quite fun quest.
---
It's probably my favorite mission, and definitely the most memorable for me. If you thought it was annoying, well that's the point. I respect it because it's not easy to make a mission that is supposed to be annoying while staying funny. Make it too short and it's not funny or annoying, make it too long and it's just annoying. I think they pulled it of really well.
---
I see the community answered for me.
---
I never heard of this type of practice in mmos my man, i don't were you get that from. Most of the character "roll back" that you describe are only due to the fact that in a short periode of time the server didn't get the information just before you crash.
---
Since when mmos allow their servers to automaticly manage players account like this ? And mate, when you crash...you crash...there's no way for the server to understand if you just close the game or crash.
---
I'm open...can someone explain me how that could be possible !?
---
That 600 HP over 8 seconds and instant 300 AP is totally overpowered, specially in PvP. And they stack.
---
Perhaps the falling fiery debris? It hits your health bar hard and fast
---
There is a ledge around the blue/grey cylinder in the middle, bit if a piss around getting onto it, but once there it seems safe.
---
This is basically how I killed Earl solo with 16 minutes left, third person, bloodied stealth commando, etc. I used the pillar in the center a lot. I’d riddle him with headshots then hide behind the pillar before he counter attacked, basically playing ring around the rosy with him. Had to stop and kill the spawns every once in awhile so they didn’t notice me, but it worked out. 
---
Honestly fighting Earl solo is much easier than fighting in public with randoms, you can guide him where you need him to be, there isn’t a bunch of people there making even more windigos spawn, there isn’t people pulling him away from me causing me to move out of my position to chase him down. It’s actually rather nice. Alone it’s controlled, in a group it’s hectic.
---
I feel you but like you gotta go in with hella stims and PA so they activate instantly. If you ever drop below half health make a run for it and don’t get back in the fight until you are back at full.
---
The half health thing is good in case the spawn come after you, you still have some wiggle room.
---
If you play a bloodied build well, that is just the price you pay for your high damage
---
I use my explosive toaster but never have enough ammo.
---
A Level 26 player with "Baby's First Hunting Rifle" takes up the slot of a higher level, more experienced player with good gear.
---
This Event is DESIGNED as END GAME CONTENT. The Event is INSTANCED. Only 8 players allowed in to your instance. It ABSOLUTELY impedes the ability to complete the Event.
---
Kidding right? You can easily clear the wendingo swipe with jumping.
---
I agree that the health regen is lame, but more than one of the Daily Ops mutations are incredibly problematic to inflict upon new players with zero warning.
---
Resilient is an obvious one - before a Daily Op, you could at least be warned about it by the Op description, but a newbie who runs into his first legendary is not gonna know what "X enemy has mutated and become Resilient" means (if the message for it even is that good). They're going to be fighting the thing not understanding why it won't die, or forced to run away. Not a fun experience for a newbie.
---
For sneaky players, rolling the improved vision one would be the bane of our existence. As is we can avoid it and/or prepare for it because it's only in Daily Ops, but it would be frustratingly difficult (again, awful for new players) to be sneaking around a legendary, just barely hitting it for enough damage to matter, then it mutates and your stealth is instantly broken, with no warning, rhyme, or reason.
---
I agree it'd be fun to have a list of mutations the legendary enemies can grow, with health regen only being one, but the Daily Ops list is too problematic to use imo.
---
I absolutely agree. Lol but I kinda enjoy the chaos. I’ve been sneaking and slashing away like a madman in there
---
I feel you there, I actually use an Auto Tesla on PC and in small doses it seems fine but the second multiple come out on full auto it’s 8-bit pixel city
---
The only other weapons I’ve seen do this at all are the Gattling plasmas,
---
And the Glitched weapons which fire around 40 explosive shots per trigger pull/tick.
---
Ultimately the game needs a lot of optimisation reworks and I pray that either on this next huge update or shortly after they release a few hotfix optimisations.
---
Yes, they all collect different things..
---
Thanks to everyone.
---
I just completed my first colossus event.
---
Dude, that's incredible. Hugely impressed you can down so fast and make it look so easy. I doth my cap to thee!
---
But also, man, the nerd is needed, haha!
---
Not kidding. It obviously depends on how laggy your server is, but generally mobs can swipe your ass even with a jetpack because of said bad netcode.
---
“Okay good he still got the loot!...
---
Wait never mind he didn’t...”
---
Lmaooo
---
🥺
---
100% agreed
---
wouldn't the brick part negate the shit house part?
---
on a full aside... i'm utterly terrified of this coming balance change.  100% of my strategy and gameplay i consider fun is traipsing about with black powder pistols and one shoting stuff while being all sneaky like.
---
i've yet to be any kind of useful in the few sbq battles i've tried and in fact have no desire to touch any ever again.
---
i really liked the idea of the colossal problem, but with the damage nerf i feel that will be entirely out of my reach too.
---
Level 280, joined in late so got paired with a lvl 80, just the 2 of us. He ran power armor heavy and I ran sneak commando, we killed Earle in 5 minutes standing in the place you land and running away before the boss die. I did the most damage but he tanks and kill most of the wendigos. You really need to min max your build be fully prepared if you don’t want a failed event.
---
Absolutely,l!!, the more the merrier! Bring on afk, it helps finishing the event!
---
Never had that problem,,once I am in a team with strange in numbers the only things I can clear with a jump is big enemies, even death claws can be cleared.
---
This. I could gush about how much I love this quest line all day, but it is so much better to discover it yourself.
---
I will say this though, I originally stumbled upon the "final location" while randomly exploring. At the time I didn't understand what it was, but once I got deep into the Matter of Mysteries quest line and I started to figure out where it was headed, I had a terrible revelation that I already knew the outcome.
---
People need to feel superior somehow right?.. A 500+ bloodied "kill a SBQ in 10 seconds" build isnt enough to make their penorz feel more than small, they have to put down people less experienced then them... the same people btw, who are complaining about the upcoming damage nerf. Dont worry the hours of your life wasted in Apalachia is still justifiable, bloodied is still the "best build"
---
In theory and in the way it was described.. yes
---
The scaling fix would make low levels a lot more useful during the event
---
Okay, like I said. You guys can continue to do whatever you want and I will gladly take newer Players through this Event without moaning and as stated -- without the use of exploits. What is so hard to believe about killing Earle without exploits?
---
Well good for you then, most people can’t even clear ghouls, because of the bad netcode.
---
There was bunch of posts here complaining about that when people got unlocked the SS jetpack.
---
it;s just an excuse for their lazy asses.
---
Sorry if this was discussed already but is the event now live on ps4 too?
---
Commando doesn't directly increase your damage, but it increases your DPS significantly by increasing your rate of fire. Theoretically, in a balanced game there would be a cost in damage per bullet, but there just isn't. You do between 1-5 less damage per shot with Commando than Rifleman, which makes the switch 100% worth it.
---
I still prefer to play Rifleman because I really like my lever action, but I keep Commando around, ready to switch whenever it's necessary.
---
No prob bud you go boost level 30s all day......... but don't come back here whining later kk.
---
Well, for starters, this isn't an MMO, so there's that. It's just a multiplayer game. "Massive" implies more than 20 players on a server.
---
And the game supposedly has SOME kind of system active to track player activity, since that's apparently how they find hackers. It's not complicated to have a checkpoint-restore system in place.
---
Ever have to do a System Restore on a computer? Same idea.
---
Nothing, it's totally believable.
---
Good for you, buddy.
---
Okay. Thank you for your permission. Have a great day!
---
Yup - went live yesterday
---
Thank you! Have a great day
---
Thats why they have private servers, if you dont want to play with randoms. Otherwise all the entitled crying is getting old fast
---
It does have a ‘number of players’ limit.
---
Get ready to use about 40 stimpaks.
---
Much love, looks great ! I'm proud of you boys
---
I'm not getting notes for those or the meat week events, only the three Wastelanders specific ones
---
There is no possible way to do that w/o obvious exploiting.
---
Yep. I need at least 40 fps to experience the effect on a GTX 1060 Full HD - Medium settings. The cave is pretty taxing with all the scream effects and dozens of wendigos.
---
I agree. The weapons were a bit underwhelming, but I loved that I got to make them myself
---
Powerful Automatic receiver (or Tweaked) is the same damage as Prime iirc. No reason to run Prime unless all you do is SBQs.
---
You played the raid, right?
---
BES also stated that legacies were going to be reworked which hasn’t happened.  
---
All they need to do is rework the legacies like they said.   And people shouldnt be mad at that cause it’s been made known they were going to change them.
---
You 100% sure? The splash screen doesnt always show, check your Misc and confirm.
---
Do Colossal Problem, you should get 8 from that, if not,  support ticket:-)
---
MAKE A TEAM! As long as someone is in the event you can tp back into the event. Set up a Survival tent right outside the mine if you want
---
158 here, all charisma/team medic build. I went in with a 250 and 190. I used a VFF90 handmade and IFF Ultracite Laser Gatling, went down twice because I wasn’t paying attention. Used 5 stimpacks otherwise and we didn’t have an issue killing Earl.
---
At least if get something useless I can at least recoup some benefit from it.
---
Exactly. Totally agree with you here. Like at a certain point I have to complete the event by whatever means necessary lol.
---
Damage death by a Commando version of a handmade/fixer is essentially equivalent to the damage dealt by the Rifleman version, it just shoots bullets faster.
---
As long as you have control over your fire (stop shooting once the thing is dead) then you won't use any more bullets than you were using before.
---
Agreed I have 11k of this stuff and never really used it.
---
Just join with area chat turned off. Play some Speed Metal music and have fun. I'm lvl 511 but when griefers try to mess with me I get in their way of their duped plasma gatlin and keep waving. Then when the event is done and i see them still going crazy in Area I switch over and say " Sorry. I was in party chat. GG gota go!" Then jump to the next event. You can hear them going crazy till the load in.
---
Cheers Hades &lt;3
---
The one above 200 of fire rate ?
---
I don't care for Earle, I want to farm the Wendigos. For me Earle is usually killed way too early, atleast 15 good minutes still to go, but no, let's run out of the cave quickly everyone...
---
Well it's a deceptive rumour that you can't stealth in there because you can. I sat in caution about 60% of the time keeping the Wendigo off the PA Heavies doing the serious damage to Earl. You just can't 'hide' really. When we almost wiped I stim'd who I could then ran the Wendigo pack around until everyone could return to the fight chamber but being in caution saved my life imo. 
---
Oh and built like a brick shithouse is an Aussie term. It just means he's tanky as fuck.
---
Doubtful but fireproof would help with the fire debris, I died more to the flames whittling my heath than the wendigos
---
You can use the main perks for Rifleman (Tank Killer and Ground Pounder) just fine with Commando.
---
My Commando build is exactly my Rifleman build but with the 3 Rifleman cards swapped for their Commando equivalents.
---
No problem, i'm glad to see you managed to do it in 12 seconds with no exploits/magic weaps.
---
thats weakest repeating argument ever on this reddit. U expect the whole 25man server to stand outside of the bunker not a single one on fence or on the roof of a bunker? How about we finally suggest to bethesda about reworking her. Thats more realistic
---
I think the only time I wasnt shooting was when running from the roar.
---
Now you mention it I'm not 100% I have on that build. Didn't think you got awarded notes at all until you finished the vault raid though?
---
Man, what a cool friend
---
I tell you one thing, if you are low on screws the numerous wendigo spawns are a godsend. Atleast 5/6 sometimes 7 screws on each.
---
I have 4 left to do, the only one I probably wont complete is the kill player one, In 2 years i've been playing i've killed 3 players, my friend twice when he became wanted and asked me to do it, to get rid of the bounty, the first was an accidental grenade blast on a downed player, before I found the pacifist button.
---
Find a fast travel location that has a suitcase, mailbox, or any other storage thing nearby. Go there with your new character, then switch to your loaded down character. Place the presents inside the storage container and switch to your new character. If you’re on a private server, your items should still be there. I’ve been doing this a lot recently and haven’t lost any items while switching characters.
---
Do you use your flux after any nuke event? If not sell each for 300 caps fast.
---
You don't drop nukes but have all these nuclear launch keys in your inventory? Sell them for 800 caps easy.
---
There's a lot of acid in your inventory? Sell it for 2 caps each , people do want it. (pretty much any junk that you can't get easily and has a use). 
---
A lot of 5.56 from killing mole miners and supermutants? Then sell it at one cap. Sell all ammo at 1 cap it will go fast and its fair. Sell plasma or fusion cores at 50 caps each so they sell and don't weight for too long. 
---
There are more things to sell like maps (30 caps each) but the best would be to research pricing on many items to see what's worth having on your machine.
---
Don’t be a jerk everyone is welcome. You have three minutes to tweak cards and maximize chems bobbleheads and magazine bonuses. Open a lunchbox and proceed. Also try not to die the cool down is a bitch.
---
I allways use 3rd person and I can say it helped with the collosus event.
---
I was able to tell when I was going to get swamped by wendigos and run out or the way or dodge them.
---
My alt char is also a bloodied and tbh I died more to the flames than attacks from the enemies so I'll deffo be taking fireproof next time, only died 4 times, 3 of which were flame related
---
no idea why your getting downvoted what you said is true.  If there is people playing the drums or turning the spits the event is super easy.  Hell if they are doing it for the 2 min warm up the event is almost done from the start.
---
&gt;community managers
---
I'm sorry but LOL nice idea though, just a placebo.
---
Yeah, don’t know why his health is dropped very fast when shooting at his feet
---
I think for the queen melt the magic weapons are responsible since she s nearly immune to explosives. I could finally get my hands on a je gat plasma when they were duped to hell 2 month ago and i figured out that my good old jffr plasma is much more effective for the queen than the legacy one. Cant say anything about the hacked weapons. Never encountered them on xbox
---
Good to know !
---
Agreed, also there should be a perk that allows the power armor to fight anything without you being inside of it. Like Iron Man. #dreams
---
I like to run straight into acid, falling fire or wendigo spawns and then die, fun times.
---
Idk man its not that hard to carry, i guess my only problem are the idiots just running around causing him to do his screech. I was able to solo it a few times at 135 and when I had a full team of high levels it didnt seem to go much faster.
---
The person I'm replying to is talking about doing that to all events.
---
To stay alive, keep your health above zero.
---
Saying don't die is not a tip and does not in anyway help anybody.
---
Level 70+ or all main storyline complete.  Either you have the levels to have figured out what your build should be or you have proven you can run a silo.
---
as a shotgunner, this event is fabulous. Those wendigo spawn drop 2 or 3 DOZEN shotgun shells. I went up in ammo as time went on.
---
But yeah, ol' Colossus is a sponge. I respawned a bunch of times getting him down -- with a lot of help.
---
Normal Laser Rifle or Gatling Laser?
---
I hated the timer so much that I changed my perks around to not die every time a little wendigo looks at me and, what do you know, it worked! Now my bloodied build can take quite a few hits and it's like a new game. It was nice to have something to push me to change some things.
---
I did it in Nuclear Winter, was a pain but you only have to down them for it to count as a kill
---
I love my stealth commando build and both my B2525 and BE. Good job.
---
I’ve built over 200 ammo machines at workshops, gotten over 400k ammo, and I’ve never been banned or temporarily suspended. I think you’ll be okay
---
Did it last night and at the end I was the only one still firing my weapon. Everyone else’s weapons were broken or ran out of ammo. I used 2 or 3 legendary repair kits.
---
People dont like to be told theyre stupid I guess. Its easier to blame the people on the drums then accept the fact that the suck... lol
---
Jump in.  Except for Colossal Problem.  Leave that one be until you are higher with more optimized build.   Everything else is doable at 45.   Even SBQ if there are plenty of peeps around.  
---
Have fun!
---
I like to be strategic about dropping a nuke an avoid hitting anything that could negatively impact other players.
---
It's always good to see other players do the same :-)
---
Just 8 more levels my friend
---
Let the people with heavy guns deal with the collosus and have at least 2 others dealing with the wendigo spawn so the heavies can concentrate on the big guy.
---
I found nuka grenades quite helpful 
---
Fireproof could help negate the fire damage from collapsed roof parts.
---
Take pot shots at the big guy if your the smaller wendigo control when you have the opportunity to, a little help goes a long way 
---
The ending can get a bit rushed because of the timer but apparently you don't have to run out, you have time to look for boxes etc.. and if the time runs out you aren't screwed it just kick you out of the mine anyway
---
These are the places I always go to get ticks.   You beat me to sharing it.
---
I haven’t failed but one event and I launched 5 nukes yesterday and ran it 7 times. I did it as a duo on one run. Ballistic weapons work best, minigun on Earl, .50 cal on the spawns.
---
I always do it, the rewards aren't that hot but it's fun.
---
This thread is particularly about the colossal problem wendigo.
---
Just like the SBQ. You're absolutely right, have no idea why it isn't like that. 🤔
---
If they’re on your server and everyone on the server can join, how do those couple of under levelled players hurt? If they left, wouldn’t you just be doing less damage overall even if they couldn’t actually contribute much damage?
---
Or does the colossus’ health scale with number of players or something?
---
Nah, you could go for a TSE25 or a FFR version.
---
had to be a hazmat suit cuz deathclaws don't work in PA.
---
And then you have people who can take Earl out in ~10 seconds. Last night myself and two others fought Earl and it seemed all three of us were using very OP weapons so the fight lasted under 1 minute.
---
Exactly this. Sick of seeing people blame 1-2 low levels out of 8 people failing the event. It’s not even that hard with 2-3 decent people.. no idea what they’re doing to fail it so much
---
Thank you very much, that’s awesome
---
you can see bases when you aim nukes?
---
Lol, at least a hundred people use it, and there's so many different channels, evolving every day. There's local(vc range), group(party), trade, and global(across all servers). It's use is excellent. The only issue is player awareness since they have to go and download/update the mod.
---
I have gotten back more bullets then I've used with an prime gatling gun
---
I wear the damn tattered dress every day.
---
Good day to you! Your post met the randomly selected criteria for me to send this mouse: https://i.imgur.com/0eG9qVP.jpg. Have a good day! 
---
 I am a bot. Please don't hurt me.
---
Almost similar, I start at vault 76, looking for soot flowers, do a small circle to the NE, then  zig zag south to moonshiners shack, kill a few ticks, then continue zigzagging to sawmill, and those cabins nearby. At the cabins, start looking for bloodleafs, following the stream to the river.head north alittle then double back, following river till no more blood leafs....make sure u get about 150 dirty water to boil.
---
Yeah but the comment he replied to wasn't.
---
Level 500+? How many thousands of hours played is that?
---
Exactly mate. We finished it with 3 of us and one person was level 34.. everyone needs to watch vids on how to do the event if they’re failing because of 2 low levels lol
---
Oh the firerate. I think it has that too. And 1 have a 25% extra fire rate. With 40% bash dmg and 30% dmg to animals and somehow it melts the colossus in 15seconds
---
Lol...that too
---
The only event you need to worry about avoiding until you're a higher level is a colossal problem the rest you are fine to do but if you're still worried or are confused by events look up how to complete them on YouTube or ask someone in the server or at the event
---
If you go to the scorchbeast queen event and kill the scorched enemies that spawn and avoid damage from the queen, the people focusing on her will be appreciative or at the very least be less grouchy as they can just focus on the queen and not worry about the other enemies
---
You should also remain in the instance until you leave, or the event ends. Last night, I got one shot/instakilled by a wendigo, literally a fraction of a second after we killed Earle. It booted me from the instance, I didn't get to loot or complete an event that I friggin launched the nuke for.
---
Fair point.
---
Nothing, if I couldn't buy it without the event or if I wasn't selling two copies of the plan.
---
Does *Baby's First Hunting Rifle* come in Legendary? Or do I need the plans for it first.....?
---
Fuck I'm renaming my Fixer thank you so much for the hilarious name :)
---
You should have seen it when we first got it on PC. It would crash us trying to join the event. After that fix If you died you could not re spawn, you had to restart the game. Then if you died after the fix and were wearing power armor you were encumbered you couldnt re spawn and had to restart the game. It was a mess.
---
They worked these things out before going to you guys so at least you were spared some of the BS.
---
Yeah. To the command area. Yes. I was able to use the surveillance   computer to search for the officers that carry the silo codes and also to track the drone that carries the key. It is strange. 
---
I do have the Holo tape for the silos. It is strange. Oh well. Thanks for all the help. I will try it again this week once the codes reset.
---
I had 3 FPS at line in the sand on my PC. Feel better now?
---
Was anyone using a legacy plasma? Didn't watch the clip, but its normally the cause
---
Buy it without event huh? 😏 I'm willing to sell it...
---
Hmm that's weird. I'm sorry you had difficulties          :( that sucks man!
---
I think somebody is using a TSE plasma
---
I’ve stayed online and never got the autocomplete bug. The one time I was logged off for the reset it happened. Honestly, it’s completely random.
---
Done it half a dozen times. No issues here.
---
You know, I actually was thinking about getting a new pet just this morning... and then colossal problem went live and I completely forgot about it. You may get an answer before then, but I’ll let you know if I can tame anything today
---
On PC it feel like the UI is made for console. It's definitely not optimised for PC either.
---
It happened to me a couple of days ago. I dropped all my fusion cores, picked them up again and the PA started functioning properly again.
---
That specific silo could be on a cool down. That holo tape should tell you. Try again later. Good luck!
---
Don't break my dreeeeeam
---
Please don’t come unless you’re 300 and above. I seen too many level 100 noobs dying ;)
---
Very nice! I'm over rotated on INT on my main currently but will try similar on my second rifle char maybe this weekend (though not with as awesome gear on the second).
---
It's an extremely active mod and is constantly being updated, actually. To anyone reading this, please download it on nexus!! The more the merrier.
---
Well said. It's not the damage nerf that bugs me so much as the increased grind for resources.  More bullet materials, more repair materials. 
---
It just seems, like you said, a way to create more grind.
---
Hopefully they balance some weapons and effects before releasing it. 
---
I like the Diablo reference but the problem here is that bloodied is about the only build with synergy.  We need more for sure.
---
You didn’t check the holotape before you took the elevator?
---
Not everyone is struggling and not everyone is swimming in TN or flux.
---
I think the rewards need upping. How about a guaranteed 3 star legendary just to start with
---
What holotape?
---
I sold all my magic weapons because I think they would destroy my gaming experience.
---
The only glitchy one I've done today had 2 of them being used. Try some more &amp; hopefully you get one without a legacy &amp; then you can compare.
---
That’s happened to me before, yeah it sucks but the card should be active the next time you go to that same silo, it shouldn’t have you use another one
---
Buggy sure. That hasn't changed. But its really fun. I bought it when steam release came out . Been playing about 5 weeks . Im 200 hours in already. I love the game bugs and all.
---
Have tried three times now, failed every time.
---
Have burned through about 10k 556, 30 fusion cores, and 80 stimpaks. It's just too much.
---
Use melee to Save ammo.
---
agreed.   I am avoiding it for now as I don't think I'd be able to pull my weight and I'm at level 195 and all I want is the new mining helmet so I'll wait to see if they start appearing in vendors.
---
You may be able to improve with well timed and farmed queen of the hunt BTW.
---
nice man, good luck - our boy Danny managed it solo in 43 seconds using stealth commando, if you don't have a b2525 fixer any commando wep with a supressor should do the trick! (may just take a bit longer)
---
Missile silo state holotape. Tells you how long the silos are in cool down, if they are. Basically tell you if somebody’s launched within the past two hours from any of the silos
---
Agreed. I played it twice and i wasn't the one that launched the nuke and the rewards for completing the event simply  don't justify the expenditure of resources. Of course I felt the same way about the SBQ the first few times I fought her so we'll see if they tweak it as time goes.
---
Prime it.
---
It's called missile state holotape, you can buy it at the Enclave bunker. It shows you the cool down on all the silos.
---
But why the fuck did it take my card?
---
I was able to tame a scorched sloth this weekend.  (Pc)
---
Thats what i always do. It just works. For me atleast ;)
---
I just said I was selling 2 copies of the plans. 🙃
---
Thats awesome guys. Its odd how few people understand that this game is absolutely full of buffs to massively increase damage and other things. i suspect there are fewer cheats than people report, many are just using these buffs. Kind of like the old pvp trick spam Nuka Cola  while being shot so you cant be killed.  
---
Great video.
---
It just got on cool down like 3-4 mins ago but still why the fuck did it take my card
---
Mines haven’t crashed yet but once the event never ended and we’re stuck down there unless we fast travel out and got no rewards out of it
---
That one I’m not sure about? I’ve always thought that part made no sense. I’m right there with you in the thought that it shouldn’t accept cards if it can’t fire. /shrug
---
twenty, non ultracite cores, at 100%
---
oh no.
---
it was such a great outfit.
---
You can legit make a post to just buy cheap cards, spawn more cargo bots/shoot other players down(all members in team can loot), or the next time you go to that silo it will already have a keycard. No worries, the first big bug you habe at Colossal will be your real test lmao.
---
Animal taming hasn't changed.
---
that was the fix! thanks dude!
---
If a player isn’t high enough level to handle launching a nuke then they should not be allowed to participate in a colossal problem, harsh but it’s fair on everyone. I don’t see them removing the player limit in the event so this is really the only alternative. There are plenty of other quests they can participate in and feel like they are contributing towards the event but ACP is not one of them.
---
What’s your psn I’ll be doing these later or now if I got a couple people to join
---
My main has the nice weapons, but I'm sitting at 15 int and had to rob luck and agility to get there ... but I'm mostly farming for legendary perk readiness there.
---
I've got a few bloody handmade on the secondary .. its only level 150 or so but I imagine they'd serve.
---
It was like a mental note to self that he couldn't translate to words.
---
Who’s gonna eat the meat? Humans! How not gonna eta da meat? Chally!
---
Bonux xp for wearing an unstoppable costume would be good too (make the tattered dress and garb of mysteries count as well obviously). Maybe even count some other wacky outfits/helmets (kinda like how the Halloween event gave you bonuses if you were wearing certain apparel) 
---
Really ride the whole "wastelander superhero" theme. It would be awesome.
---
If you really need help with it I can help. I've soloed it so we can 2 man it. I'll be on in a few hours, let me know if youre up for it :)
---
I think Battlefront 2 servers are still live, but the first is now as worthless as dog poop.
---
Used in UK too. Built like brick toilet cblock basically.
---
Agreed, the full kick out of the instance is ridiculous which needs to be fixed, then the instance should stay open for at least 5 minutes and the section you have to wait to clear to drop down into the fight should not close back up when the boss dies.
---
Hopefully
---
Funny reading these comments from "high levels" describing expectations of "low levels" to share loot and experience while countering that they "should know their boundaries".
---
Replace high levels with upper class and low levels with low income and you see the economic arguments on both sides. Funny how a video game with Supreme overlord Bethesda replicates wealth and entitlements just like real life.
---
Ready for the downvotes.
---
How would you like to sell 3 instead? 🤔😏 Tempting isn't it?
---
Psn: BlackBoyPachinoo : Thank you! I’d love that very much. Should we do it in a private session?
---
It's used to repair the Escavator Power Armor, and also is used for some obscure weapon mods like various syringer barrels
---
get gud cry baby libertard.
---
did i do that right?
---
Because you didn't use the search function

Niiiice, psn: BlackBoyPachinoo : there’s someone with a crew also in the comments offering help you wanna join?
---
I mean its used in repairing some other PA but yeah, no use in having more than 50 in your stash.
---
We was going to do it in private but yea we can do that once we get the people for it but I’m running low on cards I’m trying to get a couple more
---
Last 3 either was a bugged solo, that either gave no drop or only Flux. Pretty garbage return for 12k+ rounds of ammo dumped. I knew when Beth called the event a "Colossal problem" we were fo0ked.
---
Did you leave anyone there? Or you were the last?
---
Well done. I thought 6 minutes was good, lol
---
Probably for the best, I've got fo1st so we can do it on private. I'll add you up when I get home
---
Bloody stealth commando absolutely wrecks him I've noticed. I've done the event a few times already and just shooting him in the middle head/vocal sac area without VATS I get the most damage done and he just melts away.
---
TIL....the silo remembers you’ve inserted a key card. Never knew that, thanks for the info
---
Yeah there is definitely a lot of different avenues to explore, it's actually crazy how much you can increase your damage with the right buffs and perks! :)
---
Agreed. I’m almost 100, and it took so much ammo it wasn’t that much fun. I couldn’t help my teammates. I’ll probably skip until I’m higher level.
---
I have yet to even attempt a colossal problem because I know I’d be a problem and annoyance for others doing it. I’m still working on my build but as someone who prefers stealth and range (I do swap in some heavy gun perks if I’m doing sbq) I’d probably not be a good fit for this event. So as much as I want to do it I know that it’ll be a bit until I’ll be helpful
---
they mean like level 20s. if you have an optimized build with good gear at like 40-60 jump in and have fun
---
Probably where we got it from ;)
---
Pc player here. Still fun.
---
It's people walking him up on top of shit I bet.   
---
On Xbox I have done 14, no glitches here. Normally I grab agro and bring him back to where you drop down and we shred him. If I am playing with intelligent people 2-3 go wendigo duty while the rest kill him.   
---
Also the statement below does not seem reason I use legacy and the first few at least 4 of us had them going.
---
You think they would learn, endgame bossfight needs endgame rewards.....how long were we getting 1* rolling pins from the SBQ
---
190 here, I can solo it also. What I dont do is go in saying "ermagerd these noobs are gimping this run", or "git gud and go read how to be op" because I know not everyone has the same love of the game I do.
---
It's an mmo, there will always be people less skilled or less hardcore than you, get used to it.
---
Guarantee that none of these whiners drop the nukes
---
That's awesome!!! It has happened to a lot of people though, so logging off is good advice. We're al happy it hasn't affected you.
---
Proud of ya man! You guys certainly kick ass!!
---
Not really.
---
It's better to own both ends of the competition. Then which ever one succeeds, you invest in. Better than some other company getting the idea and putting you out of business. 
---
It's also the perfect money-hungry evil corporation move, a common theme in Fallou. Own all ends of the competition and get your workers to compete. CEO's win, workers get shafted.
---
Niiice. Rad on I wanna experience taking this Earle guy down as I heard 2/10 of the people who’ve done it got a high end loot
---
I've wanted to play fallout with (note not against) friends ever since F3. I've played since launch and in the beginning I was reasonably happy. But it has turned into an amusement park, doesn't feel like a post nuclear role playing game anymore. Don't get me wrong I still enjoy the game, just differently. It's fun for me in the same way as borderlands, not in like fallout anymore.
---
Ignore that event, it will just give you scrip and it's not important for Grahm's event
---
I agree, it's been my favorite so far, and I recently started using it once I got the brotherhood beret, such a shame
---
Aye, never heard of someone killing earl in 15 seconds. Even saw ppl with hacked bloodied gear struggling. I think i gonna test that cause rn i can't believe it mate.
---
I did it 3 times on Xbox yesterday and yeah at times it was glitchy. I’m guessing ppl where using legacies. But other then that each time we killed him
---
Daily ops give you a lot of ammo back for completing them, I usually get about 2-4 ultracite fusion cores. Why SBQ and Earle are different despite being more ammo intensive I don't know.
---
bc of BGS’ lack of ability to make functioning video game mechanics 
---
next question
---
I have only gotten 3 stars from him as a drop and as the event complete reward, then if you get a cursed it is a 3rd.
---
I don't know if I could handle that kind of power.
---
2 stealth commando can kill it solo,don't blame new players if you can't kill him with a full squad
---
I'm at level 155ish and I'm already at the point of dropping low level legendaries
---
Being able to 1 shot uranium fever with an anti armour gatling gun is fun the first time that's for sure but no point doing it all the time you just get hate
---
He was also in the floor Teleporting around or just not there entirely
---
T65 power armour, medic pump w/ some super stimpacks, vampires minigun, much ammo, 15 minutes.
---
I've gotten 1 stars when looting his body
---
Do it for the fun, not for the rewards
---
I always open the map, see overall level of all players first, then deciding.
---
Shiskebab plans are like infinity stones, you need them for full power.
---
Believe me, no ones figured it out yet. It’s pretty fucking stupid.
---
My loot so far has been a plus hie, a rug, a cursed shovel, a 3* stalkers crossbow and a 2shot flamet
---
It's a bug with certain legendary effects and high fire-rate weapons or multi-pellet weapons.  Basically it's like a damage cascade in the former, where the damage just keeps doubling with concentrated fire on the same location of an enemy kinda like furious, but with no cap, and only outside of VATS, or with shotguns, it deals the damage that should be split amongst its pellets, per pellet - but only if using it in VATS.
---
You can technically kill it before all the rubble goes down then
---
It wasn't working since they broke it back in patch 20
---
Weird, must be an effect of kiting then? Like I said I grab agro piss him off and take him  to the drop area never had a single issue so far. But if he is porting around I could see that being a pain in the ass.
---
They could always delay aspects of the PTS for future patches, like they did with A Colossal Problem and Legendary perks. At this point I wouldn't be surprised if the adjusted damage calculations were delayed; but One Wasteland, Daily Ops, and (finally) Legendary perks are coming along fine.
---
I love how all the comments on the video are about Meat Week.
---
If you were to read my description I don't find it fun. Wasting all my resources to only keep dying and dying and dying to a plethora of mostly unseen damage over time in the dark... not my cup of tea.
---
And for completing? Just wondering if I am just super lucky as normally I do not have that level of luck.
---
You’ve... adjusted to the Wasteland well, for only just leaving the Vault 1 year ago...
---
Hhhm you have very kind intentions but I do really dislike when low levels run in front of my flamer and I die with the resplendent bug,btw that’s happened twice now
---
Still miss those castlemaine four X ads 😂
---
I was just thinking this the other day. How did they mine with the excavator power armor?
---
Pickaxes? They have this crazy advanced armor and give their workers wooden tools to do the job? Doubtful. I also doubt they punched the ore out, it's simply not smart. 
---
They must have had some heavy machinery that the power armor users lugged around to assist in the mining. They could have been dual wielding massive bloody drills!
---
Yeah no finishing Prime Cuts successfully means being as fast as possible, the timer on that event is unforgiving.
---
If you have a Camp in or near the Ash Heap you can also sell it fast as people are often doing the Excavator Amour Quest
---
and?
---
So you’re saying you want high levels to be able to kick low levels off the server they’re already on just so they can do a single event? That’s a terrible idea. The issue here is that you just don’t want them getting a few rewards from not as much work as you’re doing, even though it costs you no extra ammo, aid, or extra effort. Selfish
---
I’ve never encountered the Auto-complete bug
---
Stole my exact post but 👍
---
Congrats! It's good to see people proving this event not so hard because reading people whining about how hard It is is just tiring
---
Its an excellent screw farm, just bring a beefy one shot weapon and reap the 80+ screws from all the wendigos
---
Seems I'm your evil (opposite) twin. I've wanted to play fallout with (note not against) friends ever since F3. I like how VATS works now, like a quick toggle aim assist, not disrupting the combat flow like it used to. I and a couple of friends still game together after wives and children.
---
I do agree about reading everything and would love the old games remastered.
---
Played it 3x tonight. Third one, only had two people show up. On one hand, ty for coming! But on the other, all they brought was a single shot pistol and a fire axe. Getting paired with teammates like that isn’t...ideal, sadly and unfortunately. I appreciate that they came and helped where they could especially since it was just us 3 but man!
---
Other benefits include a smaller VATS cost, a slower rate of degradation, and the option to still play semi-auto by tapping the trigger button instead of holding it down.
---
No no no! Don’t do that! Join, have fun. The events are my favorite part of the game. Don’t just count yourself out like that. Just be active and do your best. There are way more kind players in this game than nasty in my experience. Not joining is just not fair.
---
watch the timer too. 
---
The other players left, including the one which started the event.
---
My buddy and i lost it with Earle down to 1% health.
---
cheers man, yeah stealth is king!
---
Once again I completely agree. And the end reward is way better than that one small legendary. 😊
---
Yea, the event isn’t impossible but neither is the imposter sheepsquatch or scorchbeast Queen. I don’t mind having new players join the events or shit but you can’t tell me that Johnny wearing his naked power armor chassis and totting his lvl 15 nocturnal hunting rifle isn’t an annoyance because you know that he’s taking up space on the instance for someone who will actually be able to help.
---
My group of 4 did it by ourselves. I wasn't even on my highest DPS character and none of my other team really is spec'd for max damage. It was a tough fight for sure but we completed it with about 8 mins left. 
---
It's hard but not impossible. Really enjoying it so far. The worst part is the spawns following you out of the cave, especially the first time since it doesn't tell you how to get out. 
---
I enjoy these harder challenges and boss fights. I hope they keep adding them! We should get 1 with each expansion. I love the SBQ fight and run it a lot but variety and rewards will extend the fun for sure.
---
Yeah I think that's the aim, we would like in an ideal world to get an 8man bloodied stealth commando team, same gear, same buffs same build to do speedrun attempt of Earl, then Queen, then Encryptid one after another
---
Yeah, u have to finish the raid first
---
&lt;3
---
If this was DESIGNED as truly END GAME CONTENT, it would only be available to END GAME PLAYERS. Having no pre-reqs to join (no min level, no final mission progression, etc) means it's a PUBLIC EVENT for ALL LEVELS. It really just sounds like you need to be carried by high levels tbh. There's nothing wrong with that, except that you're trying to exclude low level players who need just as much help as you do.
---
That's fucking hilarious. Just chilling on the roof with his legs dangling off
---
Thanks man! yeah that's what prompted the post, trying to lighten the mood a bit and get rid of some of the negative narrative around a great event :)
---
Yes, and, the excavator suit is a nice “get out of jail free” card when you’re over-encumbered since it ups the carry weight to 320 or about. 
---
I ran into a similar problem after mining lucky hole only I quickly ran out of acid. I think in the end I picked up enough ore to produce 400-500 scrap.
---
Nvm just saw a vid on it. Sad to see those magic effects are still working. I didn't want to use them anymore. But with the coming dmg nerf, everybody 's gonna use them again. Looks like i have no choice.
---
The colossus in that prime area. If you hit it on 1 head. I think because of the magic combi prefix
---
It’s always worked fine on my PS.
---
Leave it to Bethesda to delay something and still have this many bugs
---
It could have been destiny style boss fight but  buggy, laggy issues ruin it.  We finished the event, didn’t get to loot earle, I don’t think I missed much, end roll loot was not good either.  Too much resources wasted on crap rewards.
---
I've done it 4 times now and have received 2-3 3 star legendaries every time
---
As I understand it, lore wise it is the result of pollution from the Grafton Steel Mill.  While the Mill was war-time supplier to the government, it remains unclear what on earth they could be doing at a steel mill that would lead to this amount/type of pollution.
---
I got my rug and shovel, I’m happy :)
---
There's a door in the room with the sentry bot that takes a terminal to open. Always open this door when you get to that room and you can cut through there if you die. It leads to the first door on your left after you get through the security grid and door in the beginning.
---
But all consoles have software keyboards and many games have in game text chat for console so that's a lazy excuse by Bethesda
---
Thanks all. I will tweak perks and adjust the suit  (which I never even looked at after crafting ... assumed it was functional).
---
I did an accident today. I joined an event and immediately after realised I had my farming gun and not my bossing gun and setup, so I left to go to my stash. Turned out I completely left the group and was unable to zone back in, i could still see the nuke zone and the players waiting outside were the same but the event had completely gone and I couldn’t run in the tunnel...
---
Yes to the lamp part. The rest is a terrible idea.
---
Wait — ya’ll dont normally play in 3rd all the time just for the wider FOV?!
---
It does about 400% less damage. Since it shoots 1 pellet instead of 5. With each pellet dealing 100% explosive damage
---
Screws for 25 caps each?? OMG What kind of idiots are out there
---
I've been leveling with the "Lady Death" build, currently 38. When should I start transitioning to commando?
---
Also, are pistols viable? They seem to use too many agility perks for stealth, but supposed to pick up Tank Killer soon.
---
Nice gun. Be prepared to repair it after every 200 bullets though, even with gunsmith.
---
I'm not built into heavy guns and I was getting mutiple hits of 909 with the shotgun receiver on that thing.
---
It does help that I am bloodied though.
---
Lol. I got the 3 star harpoon gun.
---
Yea idk if it was because me and my friend broke it since we was messing around and thought what would happen if we PA glitch inside and boom we did and Earle is there
---
Stay filthy my friend. Also, take this upvote.
---
I’m sorry but no. Fight me. I dare you. I’m only level 58 but I will kick your ass out of Appalachia.
---
I just join for the plans.. I got terrible anxiety so i'll probably give it a rest when i complete them.. 😁 i got the rug but i really want the plushie ❤
---
It is yeah and I use T-65 PA so what gets me is why I die so fast, my health drops faster than the Nuke
---
Yes please, agreed 100%. We had a level 30 that died almost 20 time’s during the event. Lost half of the group due to their focus shifting to reviving the player. We somehow managed to beat the event but I still think there should be a minimum level requirement. Kind of like a Raid Boss more than a public event
---
This comment is a delightful mix of preachy and forced and pulls the dev into an unnecessary social justice argument. Here is your downvote as requested.
---
Software keyboards are god awful to use and even the native text chat included with consoles are more geared toward sending messages than the level of communication you need in most games.  That's why most console players just opt for voice chat.
---
prime meat is not a sharing event, you get the meat pass/fail.  it doesn't matter if you tag any of the guys, and it's a short time event that you gotta actually rush to do.   to complain about people getting that done quickly is ridiculous.
---
We need a event that is repeatable and doesn’t need nukes.  It would keep people playing, working as team and able to get rewards without timing issues.
---
I love the event. I felt, for a change, that I would die / fail...that hasn’t happened in a long time.
---
Finally, a boss event that lives up to its name.
---
Never know, plus the other stuff he would usually drop as well as the Wendigos themselves with the screws and ammo
---
That bullshit myth has been vigorously debunked numerous times.
---
I just did earl with 4 others,  he got MELTED so much so that I wasn't able to damage her enough at level 260 and was shooting her from the beginning, no drops..
---
It should, i only did it with tormentor yet though.
---
Thank you! I don’t know why you’re being downvoted. It’s only the truth.
---
Some of the easiest things to attain through trading?? I have personally never seen anyone trading a legacy for anything less than a legacy lol I want to know what trading sites you are looking at please. I'd like to have just one legacy weapon before I die.
---
Spare a thought for a fasnacht Afker ,I had to spin around in circles for hours while I was asleep!
---
yeah i get what you saying OP.
---
BUT...if i am burning through ultracite ammo and reviving your .308 hunting rifle wielding butt......I can get a bit grumpy.
---
Card is not gone,next time u enter the same silo u wont have to put in a nuke card
---
No. I don’t see it buddy, because for starters only having 2 heavy gunner perks is hardly optimal.
---
When it comes to killing things at the Prime Meat event I believe the words "as fast as you can" are in the event description... so that's what ought to be going on. 
---
There are plenty of lower level XP farming opportunities throughout the game (not to mention every high level player was once also a low level player), so to assume every event requires some kumbaya everyone gets to tap the enemy mentality is silliness.
---
Apparently you can travel to team specific ones via “travel to person” in the menu. Never tried it, but my friend said he did it for mine.
---
Bugs apart, this event is fun an challenging, just what the game needs
---
stones.
---
throw stones at it
---
It could make you have to be a general
---
If they developer who work on this game are working an "unethical amount of hours" and this is where we are at with the game and what the patches look like then it truly is hopeless.
---
I ran it about 5 times last night on xbox and really had little to no issues. Granted I was on a team of players I knew, we completed the event each if those times. It's not an easy fight, but it's not too terrible, you mainly have to watch out for the ceiling dropping stuff on you and large groups of wendigos. We ended up putting 1 to 2 people on wendigo duty, wiping them out before they could do much damage to our DPS players. Also, when the event is over and you find the exit to the boss room, spam emotes as you are leaving, this helps other players with the escape.
---
I think the damage nerf also went into effect with the patch, I haven't had a chance to do a queen since the patch, but I'm going to guess the damage will be similar when fighting the queen to what you do on Earl, might be worth checking out if one drops on the queen. (Might be a while till we see one of those though with this new boss.)
---
Yeah, so far, the event makes me use 50 stims and even then the game doesn't even register I'm spamming the stim button
---
Wendigos are not really that much as I use the T-65 PA 
---
Yeah, that's what happened last time, wasn't happy at all - the fear was good at first but now its just annoying
---
The standard one collects junk or scrap.
---
The raider one collects chems or ammo.
---
The communist one seems to collect food?
---
The Santa one collects toys.

I don't know how the game is coded so I may be completely wrong, but I've done that event hundreds of times with people on the ground and on top of things and I don't see the difference. She behaves completely random every time. What am I missing?
---
Am I weird running with 4 weapons all the time? I have a bloodied sledgehammer for big boys, an anti armor scorch baton for 'pests', a lever action for sniping and a two shot explosive gatling for heavy damage ranged. I roll around with about 5000 rds most of the time. I also carry a suit of T51b and an excavators suit.
---
My first and only like 3 got shit on by people exploiting
---
Or up the player limit to like 10 allowing 2 spots to be filled by lower level players and the other 8 reserved for high level.
---
They're still usable and not exactly in the way of Bethesda doing anything, youd be surprised how people can use them pretty well for what they are. I'd like a text chat and I play console, not a lot of people play in voice chat so they cant communicate to randoms anyway, being able to to just type out stuff ta everyone in a radius can see would still be useful in a lot of places
---
You underestimate humanities capacity for stupidity.
---
Best event ever for my revenant character.
---
When you say you lose the loot... Is it *all* loot or just whats on the boss/in the chest?
---
Me (level 200) and my level 350 friend got stuck with a bunch of level twelves. Seriously, go do the responders questline or something.
---
Just the loot from the enemies, the reward for the event is usually minuscule imo and there's a chest?
---
thanks for testing. another Palowski shelter.
---
Ran him about 10-15 times.  Only got a 3* from Earl once.  All have been 1*.  
---
Event reward though has been a 3*.
---
My cheapass bought the communist one and mostly i get propogandeflyers and grenades.
---
One reason is likely to prevent double dipping.
---
If the first instance fills up and is quickly cleared then once people get outside they could just join in on any other existing instances.
---
What they SHOULD be doing on the other hand is scaling the event based on the players present.  After all unlike Scorched Earth which can't really be scaled to the participants since people can be constantly showing up and leaving Earle doesn't need to be spawned until all of the participants are locked into the instance.  If a full instance shows up for the fight then Earle scales up to provide enough of a challenge, if the instance only fills halfway then he scales down so they have a fighting chance of completing the event before timing out.
---
And why the fuck should they pay money to get pushed around by selfish cunts like you who don’t want them at a PUBLIC event?
---
If you don’t die and make it to the exit, there’s a chest you get extra loot at at the entrance. 50 caps and some grenades/ore. Nothing fancy. 
---
The Event reward has some nice stuff, Camp plans, reclaimed gas mask, and cursed weapons are all options. Only had to run it six times to get the apparel and camp plans, so yeah.
---
Though I honestly would not say it’s worth 8 treasury notes, especially with meat week going on.
---
Same here, I just hope some is always paying attention
---
Hotnerf
---
seriously?? what a legend
---
Enjoy it while it lasts. It's situations like this that brought the damage changes upon us.
---
Idk what the main issue seems to be for everybody. I basically soloed it (cause the 71 that joined me wasn't doing anything) and I only died once, I used 10 plasma cores (not 30), the most shitty thing was I used like 50 stimpaks.
---
Stuff also just disappears.
---
Thankfully I've only had it happen when dropping stims for new players
---
I loved this quest line I think the reason no one really talks about is that A) for high level players it was just soo long ago that we have played it I think I did it at 25? Maybe 30? It was such a long time ago
---
B) it's part of the vanilla game and I guess we all just assume everyone has done it lol
---
didnt know people used repair kits.
---
i have like 30+ waiting in my stash.
---
Which magic effect does yours have? I have a TSE minigun but it seems like total shit (like at Line in the Sand, it can't even kill the scorched, it's only good for tagging). I have started checking vendors for magic weapons but I am not really sure what to even get. I've watched angry turtle's vid so I know the prefixes to look for, but nothing I find has a fire rate over 200.
---
I died once and respawned with 10 seconds sooo idk
---
Fucking try it with me. I have the build and I have the guns. I dare you.
---
Hahaha!
---
I only have issues when people use tesla rifles, it just bugs out everything something fierce. First run (with tesla rifle boi) we finished with a minute to spare, the lag was, otherwordly. The second attempt, all heavy gunners, no lag whatsoever, took 6 minutes.
---
The cursed weapons are actually really good
---
I am a day 1 player.
---
Imo i would LOVE these weapons either removed, or nerfed to current best legit rolls.
---
At the least they should only be allowed on private servers. 
---
Lately myself, and others I regularly play with, will just leave an event, or not bother trying to contribute when Mr. Pwnage is around.
---
None on the gun, I have armour with the blocking perk, that triggers it.
---
You need multiple hits in the same spot for it to work, so large things like Behemoth, SBQ and Earle just melt in seconds.
---
I just did the event &amp; completed it first try, 2nd attempt the game froze... I used up all my 5mm for my junkie minigun &amp; pulled out my faster firing ultrasight Gatling laser to find that half my fusion cores magically vanished... Resorted to using my axe on the wendigo spawn as the majority of the team was bloody useless, Then I almost didn’t get to loot the body because I didn’t see where it fell as I was trying to help out another player, Thankfully 1 person saw me running around looking for the corpse &amp; chose to wait in order to guide me to the exit The event is great but needs work.
---
I mean, I do 4 damage per shot with PsychoBuff.
---
So, I shoot Earl a few times then just kill wendigos (whom I can kill) while the people with God roll (or hacked weapons) deal with Earl.
---
Who cares?
---
maybe the glitch was effecting their spacesuit helmets and bone shards, but no body bought them so they never disappeared ...
---
Not me but every post on the top of this sub is "crying low levels are joining wahwahwah"
---
Because the rewards are garbage and the event is buggy af. People are either going back to SBQs or unsubbing.
---
I did one where it was "fall down the hole......Earls dead" seriously it was over in less than 5 seconds from reaching the bottom, by the time by power armor had stood backup from its falling animation it was time to leave.
---
?  Why
---
Agreed, mine was also only 3 people shooting that Earl William. Some players didn't come back after they died. At least the event was a success.
---
Oh man, I forgot about the magic armor piece. I was focused on finding "the right" weapon. But now you say it's going to be patched soon, argh that sucks. I've never been OP and wanted to get a taste haha
---
Lol constantly dying. I'm a bloody build and have yet to die.
---
Might be worthwhile doing the smart thing and start below 40 instead of below 20. The loss of damage (when you're above 20 at least) is considerably less punishing than the time away from the fight from being dead or having to dodge and heal so often.
---
I have a full set of random vanguards pieces (haven't got full SS yet), so I've got roughly 500 dr at max health. It's great
---
Still glitched but I did this yesterday and this is how it worked. Go to the place and put in fuse. Don’t analyze sample just log out after placing fuse. Log back in and put the fuse in again and try to analyze. It may work that way. Putting the fuse in first without analyzing and then logging out and back in and redoing it seemed to work. If you get the new prompt from the terminal just follow through. If you don’t get the quest pop up but got the new info on the terminal, walk over to the chamber and step in, its by the stairs. It worked for me and finally got it turned in.
---
Upcoming nerf and I saw the ‘killing earl in 12 seconds video’
---
Legends say that there are still some folks who didn't got the ultracite calibrated shocks or at least a decent weapon from the queen after hundreds or even thousands of kills...
---
Rng in this game sucks, deal with it or submitt a ticket to the designated support team, what are you thinking we could help you with?
---
It makes others in the event very angry, I dont recommend it :-)
---
Does his body have loot? I've completed it three times now and each time his body just disappears. I thought it was incentive to get out of the cave immediately since he didn't drop anything.
---
What's the first rule of MoM? Don't talk about Mom!
---
That a pretty big swap for your special stats. Have you thought of just making a new character? Also commando tends to do better than rifleman
---
i think it is simple. tell code to look for anomaly outside max whatever current capability rolls/buffs can be, an delete item.
---
replace with ' thank you for making game better' note.
---
1.  Everything is getting nerfed. 2. Bloodied unarmed will still be the biggest damage output and 3. That’s bloodied commando in that video not rifle
---
I’m only level 79 and don’t have a build but I’d be fine cuz I’m built different
---
Oh true, I wouldn't want to do that cuz I know how that feels lol. I would want to try to solo on private server though, just to feel like a badass
---
So your answer is a trollpost? Isn't this making you even worse?
---
Very cool.
---
Going to have to remember those buffs.
---
I thought the 3-star in the event rewards was guaranteed. That doesn't mean it won't be powered wood armor like I got yesterday, but still, between that and the 1-3 star on Earl and the potential cursed 3-star, it's got better rewards than the queen's 1-star rolling pin. It would be nice if they'd throw some repair kits in there though.
---
Yeh sorry I meant commando and I’ve got everything I need
---
I launched the nuke, didnt stop everyone bitching about it lol
---
I never sell ammo for more than 1c unless its plasma cores for 3c a piece. Every omce in a while ill pick a random caliber to sell for 0c till its sold out.
---
That makes sense
---
Ran it 6 times on PS4 with a group in private worlds last night and it went smoothly. Ranged from 3 to 6 players per event and we completed it successfully each time. I still haven't made it out of the mine at the end before the timer expires, but something to look forward to I suppose.
---
Overall the event was fun and fast paced, but this was with a group of folks that I regularly play with, are all well armed, and all familiar with each others capabilities. I look forward to trying it out in a public server to see how different the experience may be.
---
Lol!
---
You think a studio that has chronic inability to stick a deadline is going to have crunch issues to this magnitude?
---
C'mon dude. We all know they're just going to push the release of features or release it knowingly bugged and then have it delayed that way due to time required to "fix" it.
---
The entire FO76 community: "I just want to tell my new friends I met that I crashed my game and that's why I left."
---
Bethesda members in a meeting: "No no, guys... The wallpapers need to NOT function! That's the priority right now!"
---
Yeah, his body does have some goodies same with the Wendigos
---
Even so making a big swap like that will hurt you when legendary perks come out. If they stay as they are. I know im gunnu be missing the coins from when I changed my mains build
---
True, when I was still playing on Xbox I would use the Xbox app on my phone for text chat because software keyboards are an abomination.
---
Haha no doubt
---
It’s a nuke card. Your acting like it too a BE plasma gat.
---
Not weird at all. I myself have a vampire's cultist dagger, AA hunting rifle, AA shotgun, and an executioner's plasma gat. Along with a set of T-60 and Excavator PA. Variety is the spice of life, as they say.
---
Yeah, one wasteland and the damage rebalance is a good start. But there's still so much work to do beyond that
---
As fun as legendary enemies with mutations sounds. I can't deny that this is a good point.
---
They could add other mutations for legendaries. Some that are not as build breaking as the daily ops mutations.
---
Like increased movement speed, burning attacks, health regen, rad damage, rad/poison aura, mob summoning, tunnelling, limited stealth, increased cripple chance etc...
---
Oh  I can totally get behind 4-5 repair kits. I ues 3 guns during the event my main one I have to repair twice when it breaks the 3rd time I swap, my over 100 repair kits I had saved up from the queen are diminishing fast.
---
Wow, a hundred people huh? How many people play F76 on PC? A hundred thousand? Maybe more?
---
The odds of ending up in the same session as someone using this mod is tiny, which makes it no more useful than a community Discord channel.
---
Or just not limit the number of players....
---
Post number 71,102 about the issue will *surely* be the one that gets it fixed.
---
Oh, certainly.
---
Trust me I’m lv 400 and I know there are only 4 perks I really want from ledgendary perks
---
So this is like that AngryTurtle video but with three and buffed to the teeth.
---
Impressive video and great teamwork!
---
Oh wow 50 caps..... 
---
Yeah, just after the rug now I think 
---
By now? no lol I have all the gold stuff if they released it earlier that 8 note might mean something
---
Yes, you will need a different keycard for each nuke.
---
You can either buy them from other people or you can down the various cargobots that you encounter randomly in your spare time.
---
Yeah, you need a new keycard everytime. 
---
You can stumble on the cargobots that carry them, but its a low chance. Buying them from players in vendors or on the market subreddit will be the fastest way to get them, but not the most cost friendly.
---
Yup.
---
I bet you suck Bethesda off for a living
---
It will only comes in the purveyor or is it in the quest/events loot table as well ?
---
My issue with the fight is locking it to 8 people. The other night I started with 6 people and about 5 minutes into the fight it was me and one other guy. Neither one of us had magic guns or min/maxed bloody/junkie builds so the fight was pointless as it was impossible for us to beat him. If they are going to lock the fight at 8 people, they need to make it a rolling 8. 
---
Also has anyone done this fight in the PTS and with the damage out lowered in most builds was it even possible to complete, as this guy is spongy as hell.
---

---
You need at least 6-10 on average. It took me 15 runs to get every possible reward.
---
This has to be the topic a new post! Go for it
---
I have loot loops close to vendors. Like Harpers Ferry or the mine next to the Whitespring train station. Shoot everything and loot everything yes everything even the cans. Sell it all with hard bargain. Being close to the vendor being over encumbered isn't a problem. Plus you get XP and the occasional legendary.
---
Alot of respect I shall show towards you this was honestly amazing. I did give you a award aswell. Happy Nuking!
---
Your second point is right but the first is not the nerf will destroy unarmed
---
I'm level 378 and will be missing them even only wanting 3 haha. I can max out 1 card with the points I have banked. No clue on what I've got in my deck for coins though
---
Go for it if you want man, it's up to you. Bloodied unarmed hits hard but you have to run up to something to hit it. Commandos tend to do better
---
Wtf lol. They’re common af. Clearly your 12 and have no clue what your doing
---
I can't help with the solo question, but you can find plenty of people selling the key cards these days. I have a couple in my vendor at the moment. If you hop on over to a trading sub and make a post, I bet you could probably find someone selling pretty quickly.
---
It really depends on the weapons too. My friend is level 60 something with a level 25 instigating double barrel that can one shot level 76 wendigos. But i dont do any damage with my 2 shot plasma gat at level 102
---
Can i ask why there is a limit on how many people are allowed to fight Earle ? The server can not handle it ? Just sounds asinine to me .....
---
It's not lost, just "stored". You won't need to insert a new card the next time you do that same silo. The only time you lose the card is if you enter the wrong nuke code on the keypad.
---
I only want the poison resist and that’s about it as well as the ammo perk
---
Shit I feel you there, a fuckin level 7 was like “oh an event, hmm lemme go an get my ass kicked” we almost fuckin failed if it wasn’t for my friends pushing an pulling through. An the other few ransoms were awesome keeping all the level 75s off us an doing mucho damage with us. With only 4 minutes to spare we did it. I advise anyone that’s a super low level just not to even try. It’s hard enough making sure my guns are good, that my friends guns are good an same with power cores for power armor. I give the level 7 credit for actually at least trying but it was a dumb fuckin idea. Lol. I love the event an all but DAMN. SBQ looks like a fuckin chew toy to the colossus. *SQUEAKY*
---
Will still by a distance be the strongest damage output in the game. Properly built and with buffs will dish out 20-30k a hit now. If they nerf it 50% it’s still by a mile the biggest damage output
---
You sound like a bloodied build. Have you thought about raising your health to just under 40 and using the buffer for more sustain? You're going to go below 20 a lot anyhow but it gives you more leeway to heal back up and you do more overall damage because those times you're downed or spamming stims are wasted seconds not damaging something.
---
I'd be happy to give you one, or let you use the private server if you want the thrill of getting it yourself lol but I won't be home for like 9 hours and I'm sure you'll get other offers by then
---
Sadly I am well aware of human stupidity. That's why I advocate for less handholding. If we stop protecting the stupid the problem will eventually sort itself out.
---
Also applies to real life, BTW. Darwinism is a wonderful thing if we'd just let it.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
I was put with a bunch of low levels and some high levels but once the event started all the high levels left and it was just me and some level 30s and 20s and even tho im lvl 210 i may not be as op as some since i dont use legacys.
---
It’s not a 50 % nerf it’s about 2/10 of the damadge left
---
I just want to get credit for the kill if my teammates kill it
---
Yes, it is an one time use. I would suggest always having two nuclear keycards when you go to launch a nuke in case you type in the wrong code the first time
---
About the lamp, I think it's a lightning bug and not a feature. It won't work if you have a headlamp. And it works on other near items with the same material.
---
I’m all for this
---
Your claiming it’s an 80% damage nerf? Really?  Where are you getting your information from.
---
Lol I was too scared to join an SBQ until I was level 60 and did all major quest lines
---
I joined the event last night. There were 5 or 6 people there, all high level. I had my bloody faster fire rate 50 cal and my junkies explody LMG. Both primed. Plenty of ammo. I thought we would waste him in no time.
---
Boy, was I wrong. Ran out of stimpacks half way through. Dying all the time. Went to half rads instead of full bloodied. Don't remember when but at some point a few of the high level players left. Low levels took their place. We got spanked, repeatedly. I don't even know how much ammo I spent.
---
The timer ran out with Earl still at about 20% health.
---
Level 550 and I couldn't do it. Had to tuck my tail between my legs and run back to camp. Gotta optimise some more. Drop some weight, ditch my weight reduction perks. Get a shit load more stims. More chems.
---
Imma go back for Earl..
---
Recent players on Steam. But you need to be friends with on most cases.
---
16 times the accuracy
---
I play 90% in 3th person. As a Melee player it's the best you can do. You see everything around you and when someone come from behind you can react and jump away or something. Especially in this event it's useful because the baby wendigos come from all sides lol.
---
Yeah love farming bosses with thousands of ammo that takes hours of farming to craft for worthless drops! Super fun mechanic bethesda love it, keep up the great work
---
Sorry should have said on turtles video there was a bloodied swing speed deathclaw gauntlet and the comparison was from 2k and something to 218
---
People who don’t use third person the majority of the time playing this game are gimping themselves.
---
As much as the rebalancing they're doing for damage multipliers and one wasteland is helpful, it means fuck all when they're leaving multiple well-known damage bugs/exploits in the game
---
No you can't
---
Just did my first on PS4 and it was fun (and heavy on the resources) until I died.  Had to wait ages for the respawn, he was defeated as I was outside that area.  I then couldn't find a way out of the mine so guess I had to fast travel and pretty sure I got no reward for all that damage etc I inflicted.  Not sure if I'll bother again for awhile as I just don't have the ammo resources at the moment (think I burnt through 10+ fusion core amongst more).  Disappointed!!
---
Earle died, and I saw the loot inventory and then died behind him and respawned at the mine entrance outside.
---
Even if I couldn't have found his body, I still wanted to loot all the screws from the wendigo spawns. :-(
---
Maybe next time.
---
&gt;How there still isn't text chat in a multi-player game is beyond me.
---
Bethesda seems ready to abandon the PC market and focus almost all of their attention on consoles.
---
Thanks man :) - our boy Danny (whose youtube I linked) was the absolute mastermind behind the whole thing, without his testing we wouldn't have gotten anywhere near this time
---
It really is.. I'm having to run around VATS and use crits to quickly melt them, I make sure it's not a Legendary and kill them if it is, I do the emote and usually turn on my mic and say "Legendary over here, be quick"
---
Hmmm I can’t see that staying. That’s extreme. See what actually hits the servers tbh.
---
Buy from a player vendor, usually 1 cap per cell
---
I do. AND I cradle the balls. The fuck's it to you?
---
Yeah my first try was with my wife (both over 100) and 2 random level 50 dudes. Wasted 3000 rounds just to get it to half health twice. Not fun. Not trying to be mean or say it's those dudes fault (because no one else even showed up). But that was a serious time waster. I'm really iffy about joining the event again.
---
I'm not sure, but I remember that one youtuber checked it on PTS some time ago and they aren't, despite the look.
---
Ye I've tried that buy the scream just ends up me running into a drill or posion. I've done it about 6 times lol. And I'm sure my conroler is broke because when I've I try use stims it just donest work  I button mash it but it takes like 4 times just for 1. Espicaly when my guy is running from the scream. Lol i do try keep it for others. I don't mind being a pin cusion for others who can do more dmg than me but I feel bad for others.
---
I know it’s horrible and thanks for that advice I’ll probably wait and see
---
In my case i played 4 colossal problem 4 times, got meat pile and vendogo colossus plushie plans + gas mask 🤔 Am i lucky or..?
---
I know right, I was super relieved to get it done. It’s been a few weeks for me as I just started playing again but am at lvl 52 now so it was long past due. Me and someone else both tried it and it worked. It’s crazy that it’s still broke but hope it works for you too. Good luck!
---
You really think they don't want another broken update? Hahaha
---
They do this on purpose. The game should not work flawless.
---
Text chat and easier friendslist. Yesterday, I was browsing someone's vendor and tried to research something before buying an item. The guy logged out and even if I add him, he'll probably never see the friend request. Friend requests need to consistently show up and not be invisible 90% of the time.
---
Shout out to Danny whose video I linked - without his testing and planning we'd have never gotten close to this number - well worth subscribing to!  [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeYa0VtqpjEbwtUvkUNNi\_w](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeYa0VtqpjEbwtUvkUNNi_w)
---
Damn I got hard down voted. Yeah, just found that out too when a buddy had it happen. Always learning new things in this game.
---
The CSS has enough damage resistance that you are penalized for using a berserker weapon.
---
Nahhh you just a bitch
---
Plans plans plans plans plans plans plans and recipes.
---
The flamer works really well against the spawns especially if you have a horde of them
---
If had the fuel reserves pretty sure i could solo this. I carried 4 people last night on my last run. Should be a required level though. The queen is no big deal because you can have as many as you want there. This is instanced max what 8? So yeah needs to be lvl locked.
---
One Wasteland seeks to solve this exact problem, so we'll see how it turns out.
---
Yep. I burned through about 3000 rounds of 2mm electromagnetic on him in one go. They really need to reduce the ammo weight and increase the crafting quantity of 2mm, because it is absolutely ruinous to craft gauss ammo in bulk. 
---
And FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DON'T USE THE TESLA RIFLE IN THE EVENT. The ash piles lag everyone into submission, and there is enough shit going down already.
---
Would live a bright headlamp for my strangler haha
---
I've believed for a while the real issue is with some upper management. If that's the case, it wouldn't even matter how much the devs work to an extent, if they don't get the resources to do anything with that. Also, they could just have like 5 people working all day instead of a real team of devs
---
No unfortunately. Afaik this was reported during the PTS pre-testing of the event but never got addressed.
---
And how’s that make sense?  They’re not needing the weapon. I’m a B Commando buikd with 5 strength blocker and bandolier and my DCG equipped is 790 damage. With zero buffs or oerks?
---
Hopefully it means we see less of the pure baby moans on this sub if the event can be done in 12 seconds lmao
---
I picked up a bloodied from a meat cook. Will have to try this out today.
---
Well, if it helps, you can kill the spawns to keep their numbers low as they're easier to kill, that way higher levels can focus on Earle rather than swapping constantly
---
Just make sure to get a few hits on Earle himself so you can get loot
---
I literally just want the exactly the same the as op does, also how tf am I making anyone pay money for anything?
---
Yeah that would be sweet.....And I'm glad you guys were able to get it done.......Also quick side question do you know if you have multiple characters if they level up score separately or if they each rank up a single score board by chance?
---
You can still get the plan even if you side with the raiders. Just takes a little longer
---
It's not racist, because "rural" isn't a race, but if you go somewhere with the notion of "all these hillbillies are ignorant, racist pricks," you're going to interpret anything that happens as racist, because you're looking for it, and you're more likely to be going in with an attitude people will find offputting. 
---
That's what I was saying to the person above.
---
It would probably make servers crash.
---
I've tried lol perfect for crowd control and does a nice amount on Earle
---
There are two cool downs, one from the bunker and one personal.
---
Nobody stole your key card, you dumped it. Clearly your own fault, missing knowledge isn't an excuse.
---
I went to 40-45 health in T65.
---
Geez that last line gave me the chills......Papa Todd.....Is that you?
---
That one isn't me. You can hop out of the cave pretty easily from my setup, really. Mine's just a house on the cliff with a locked door and a half-assed attempt at a "secret" cave for my workshop.
---
It's odd you quote turtle but totally ignore the big turtle acknowledged that the unarmed numbers don't add up, even factoring in the nerf. 
---
There's some other calculation or bug going on affecting unarmed. It's not just because of the damage nerf.
---
If you can run blocker, dodgy, fire proof and have reactive plates on your pa it helps. I have yet to die in the event.
---
Nice run dudes. Very impressive. 
---
Side note: to anyone else wondering why Bethesda is crapping all over stealth for the upcoming Daily Ops, here's a great example of why lol.
---
Thanks I didn’t realise
---
This doesn't look like a regular glitch, at least nothing that happens naturally.
---
This looks like someone used a concussive weapon, they were cut from the game exactly because of this bug could occur.
---
Cripple them with shotguns. Easy
---
Because not everyone is blessed by RNG god/s. I have only received some scrip worthy armor and weapon pieces, nothing cursed and nothing worth selling even. It all depends on RNG and many times it just seems brutal and demoralizing.
---
Regardless It's always good to know people are getting some nice pieces, maybe my RNG luck will change.
---
Yup you can have 18 out of 19 at once. Since herbivore and carnivore take the same space
---
i'm on xbox as well. i didn't know anyone on the team, I just ran into the event. it was an amazing fight, just being my first time doing the event i was hoping for a smoother go at it. what you had was similar to me, there was 5 of us and 2 of them fought the windego spawns while myself and the other 2 tried taking down Earle. with the emotes i will remember that for when i do finally complete the event. thank you for the heads up. and what you say is true, we may not see a SBQ for quite some time
---
THE DANGER ZONE
---
Don’t let the predictable fo76 shitstains get you down.
---
I agree, that would be very helpful.
---
I would love people built small realistic camps so the game would work better and be more stable. But I won't ask people to change their style. We all play for fun, in the end. If the game allows it, then, it is OK. I have seen huge drops during Scorched Earth, even servers collapsing, and zero Teslas.
---
You're assuming that nothing changes beyond the damage nerf.
---
Given the changes have yet to go public, whose to say that there wouldn't be some degree of adjustment elsewhere e.g. with the Colossal's health or resistances?
---
I did two silos yesterday the first did not have an issue. However, the second had the problem you did.  When the options would not load I went thought the steps as normal and eventually the quest marker appeared and updated to allow the grid to open.
---
Keep your eye out for radiation rumble event, get there early and you can grab one. You don't have to take part in the event.
---
Yeah but it's a drop that I desperately want
---
That was the only good luck I ever had and will ever have. My RNG luck needs some years to get back to its peak :/
---
Any new quests or maps to explore?
---
Same old collecting random guns to grind old content? 
---
K, see you all around when this game gets fucking serious.
---
Thanks I'm gonna collect (almost) all now and see how it turns out
---
Fuck this is such a good idea
---
I got three failed events! It was Epic.
---
heavy gunner is almost like a must have for this even, at least that is how i feel about it. out of the 5 people in this go around only myself and other guy had heavy guns. 2 were melee and one was shotgun
---
Yes, easiest way is to buy the ones you want from a player vending (150-250 on xbox). Some are melee focused or ranged so depends on your build which you will want to get. You will also need the perk card ‘starched genes’.
---
Oof nope I don’t know but that’s a good question. Might try later myself. I’m guessing it would be separate but can always give it a go and just do a test.
---
I remember doing that quest when FO76 first came out. 
---
I remember laughing and thinking that this was the most sadistic mission anyone had ever come up with.
---
And I remember how my game crashed just before I finished, and when I reloaded, the horror when I realized I had to do the mission all over again.
---
I think you’ll find it’s more the level 50-100’s that are complaining. They cannot solo it and without a top buikd or 2-3 high end damage dealers in the team it’s a fail. So if 4 spots are taken by levels 20-50 it kills the event for them. I’m level 279 and can solo it I assume. Do plenty of damage in a team the two times I’ve done it and completed it twice. I couldn’t care less if the 5 players are useless for the event as long as the other two can help deal high damage. All good.
---
Someone posted a video of that (or another similar instance) where someone took him down in seconds.
---
I have this but it's sort of the opposite I see whenever I leave my power armor then it enters my score I can't get my score well in power rumor I do a challenge and power it still gives me it but I can't collect the score till after I exit
---
2 out of 5 times the event failed for me too.. 
---
I know how it feels brother :(
---
Not following OSHA regulations
---
Throw thus duped shit in a lake
---
You need 1-2 people with enough damage to one shot wendigo spawns and everyone else focusing the boss (even if they can't one shot wendigos the chip damage over time is enough to eventually down the boss). And Fireproof 3 or asbestos chest piece mod + fireproof 1 for survivability from getting feared into hazards. There were a lot of close calls for my bloodied melee build, but by far the thing that got me killed more than anything was frame rate drops from wendigo spawns toward the end of the fight which stopped my stimpaks from registering quickly enough. Keep them controlled and all is fine. At least until the future rebalancing update if we can't one shot control the wendigo spawns anymore...
---
Has something like a 12 or 15% drop rate, so not really
---
It is just balanced right?
---
You want to do that high damage you pay it back in lack of health. Or you do a third damage but you have 5x the health.
---
My friend gave me my first ultracite PA set, fully modded, from his PA collection. A few days later I noticed I had a second full set of ultracite PA (no mods) in my inventory. I had to double check that my original was still in my stash and it was. I don't know if it was an event or mission reward or what, but I ended up giving him the barebones version so he could add it back to his collection. No idea why it happened, but it hasn't happened since.
---
Yup, completion so annoyed given the time/resources.  Mostly just wanted the treasury notes for that damn bullion grind (means I don't have to play as much for a bit and bank some up).  Won't make that mistake again, should have just died in the collapse and loose some junk.  Ah well, will know for next time I guess
---
At the moment, especially on consoles, yes for a bit. But as the Colossal Problem event goes on, it won’t be. In other words: sell now.
---
oh the event and fight itself was awesome, i loved it. i don't have any issues using a ton of ammo and stims as long as i can successfully complete the event. good job for getting it done!! 
---
private server will for sure make a difference in how it runs, i was on a public server
---
I have starched genes and run a bloodied mele build but that isn't going to stop me from injecting everything I can find into my body
---
If you don't like key cards being stolen blame that on Beth. If I see something I can shoot, and it gives me loot then it's part of the game. Hard to make the distinction between bugs and not very straightforward gameplay. At around level 40 I had a Cargo Escort shoot the roof off of my CAMP at the Wayward. You got the wrong bitch if you think I'm not blasting em out of the sky 😂
---
I'm talking about the gas mask that was added with the new bos
---
I had to dashboard and load back in to get it to reset
---
I’ve finished the heist can I still earn rep with the settlers somehow?
---
I had a level 35 revive me twice during a CP event. The more the merrier, IMO.
---
I doubt it - there are other mods that are missing from one armor to another, generally only X-01 has almost full set of mods available (missing only Welded Rebar).
---
On consoles, the event just opened so the market isn't saturated rate.  But on PC, with a drop rate of 12% I believe, most cursed weapons are not rare at all, and the market is completely saturated.  I myself have 6 cursed harpoons and 3 cursed pickaxes, but no shovels cause my rng sucks.
---
I'm only holding onto them so I can find the one person who has many shovels instead and wants swap one of them.
---
3 times I have done the event, 3 times Earl just clips through the ground and goes into the limbo....
---
It needs push to talk. Xbox /ps4 feature that allows you to hold a button that takes you from party chat to game chat
---
One of my best interactions on this was a random guy running up to me
---
"Hey, Hey dude, Dude do you have any radaway, I got so many rads dude"
---
This was when I was a lvl 20 in the ash heap and he was also lvl 20. It really felt like a guy in the wasteland needing help and it was a great little human interaction, I guess this is what Bethesda indltended when they decided not to have any NPCs. That interesting interaction would come from other people
---
I use those and sometimes med-x and sometimes psycho since I usually end up getting addicted to psycho anyway. I don't like formula P because I can't share a perk in a team with it since it's -2 CH.
---
That is *very* strange indeed. I can sort of understand your glitch. Since so many assets were ported out of Fallout 4, maybe they somehow got Paladin Danse’s affinity code mixed in with the SCORE?
---
I’ve done that event so many times and still haven’t gotten the good stuff. Lvl 268.  Gave up on the random rewards do it for fun now. My expectations are very low on the colossal event.  Heck I can’t even get the good plans at the meat week event !!!!
---
I go to just below 40 in T-60. Yet to die or even really get below 15% health.
---
I'm with you. I love this event and enjoy the difficulty. Dying has consequences. Looting during the battle carries risk. The excitement of killing the boss turns into panic to gtfo while 30 wendigos play the bongos with your head.
---
Some people just don't like the challenge and want to take their time and pick up every last little thing and come out "on top" after every event. Hopefully this vocal minority doesn't nerf the challenge for everyone.
---
Text chat from a fo76 pipboy app on your phone would be great so you can type quickly and it appears in game
---
Yeah I wanna try it because if it all levels the same then in theory a new character should level it even more than normal and if they level separate then that would mean you get more caps and atoms....
---
I love the challenge it's so fun but I cannot stand the amount of times I die due to the windigos
---
Melee damage bug is already fixed on the PTS. Don’t change your build based on the PTS, it can all change before it goes live.
---
I know someone with lvl 1100 who didn't got a single god roll or calibrated shocks yet. He did nothing else then queens for several months before wastelanders.
---
Did you do the quest where you join the Brotherhood of Steel?
---
&gt; Ye I've tried that buy the scream just ends up me running into a drill or posion. 
---
That's a positioning issue. You need to better environmental awareness. Also, might help to fight in 3rd person (if you're not already).
---
&gt; And I'm sure my conroler is broke because when I've I try use stims it just donest work I button mash it but it takes like 4 times just for 1 
---
That's more of an input lag issue. I empathise with this one as it's not your fault. 
---
Only way around it is to proactively start healing ahead of when you think you need it, but that's a workaround. Bethesda needs to fix shit like this.
---
Yup. Just doing the dailys, same as raiders. The opposite side you chose doesn't hate you after. Theyre just kinda like wtf mate then get in with your life
---
Amen lol. they just stun me all the time the I end up running away from the scream lol.
---
Oh yeah, is that what it was? Now I feel dumb lol
---
Oh what are the origins I misread it and I was about to reply with they hurt Don't touch them
---
I had a run where he got stuck in the ceiling too. Had to shoot his feet, but we still ended up downing him. At least he can't hit you with the scream that way.
---
FYI, if you want to summon u/Ladydevann, I believe it has to be in a comment, not a post. IIRC, she doesn’t get the notification otherwise.
---
Then don't do it. You don't need to come to the subreddit and complain about it. Some of us enjoy the challenge and don't need to have our pockets filled after every event.
---
This shows my new Fav gun, explosive laser (mag has glitched out lol) [https://youtu.be/P13xhVlY4KI](https://youtu.be/P13xhVlY4KI)
---
This was my first go with Earle with the TSE, others shot him first so he started moving, once he stood still and I got him :-)
---
[https://youtu.be/WcjL7OQRYzE](https://youtu.be/WcjL7OQRYzE) (Don't know why it's squashed)
---
No, it fucking took it
---
Yeah it's the windgos there's way too many of them but that's the fun of the challenge
---
Sofia should start up a new chapter of the order.
---
I was doing Prime Meats the other Day in the Cranberry Bog and a I was alone until a low level popped in, lvl. 26 or 28 I think. Things went well until the Fog Crawlers spawned, the low level ended up getting chased by one and and ran...leading it away from the event zone. By the time I killed it I lost so much time I ended up failing.
---
Ok thank you I didnt know.
---
Sneak lets you stay undetected before shot. Escape artist lets you run away and lose aggro once detected.
---
When I annihilate a enemy in a single shot I give everyone time to at least get a shot in, but that doesn't stop the fight lasting the ten seconds grace before i fire
---
This does work.
---
Ye it's kinda awkward for me because I can be unobservant and I'm sure bosses love me. I can't hide or go any WHERE. It's kinda funny but also very irritating.
---
U get a full set of raider armor completing Rose quest.  
---
Score bug is a visual glitch.  While in PA if u finish a score mission u will not get the full bar to show up.   But once u exit ur PA the score barn shows up.
---
I understand where you're coming from but personally I feel like with the collapse of the entrance kind of fitting that it doesn't allow people back in because you can no longer get in there if you were just walking thereimagine it from the in-game perspective you are the person you can't get inside of a building that you can't walk inside
---
I think you underestimate how bad some players are, and then make specific account names shitting on the developer and complain about how hard it is and that it's "not worth it".
---
Insane AP refresh and criticals dished out.
---
I would like to see what you do to the Queen the first time she lands.
---
Thanks for the warning I won’t change my build yet
---
The cursed items aren't anything special. Pickaxe is ok but thats about it.
---
If you're talking the damage nerf and One Wasteland, it's a much needed change to the game but it's only the first step. More balance changes (not just nerfs but likely buffs too) will be needed.
---
And you're just giving away this information for free?!
---
No the colossus is in the ceiling
---
I think it might be reasonable on sbq too. I haven’t failed to kill her in a long time on PS4, but the upcoming damage nerf might make that trickier. Anyone have experience with sbq on the play test server?
---
As someone who can't one shot anything high level, I don't have any feelings about the changes coming up.
---
That is the best. I personally went twice yesterday and was lucky enough to have 4 high levels alongside (i am 153). Plus one guy 31 and another 40something. Was even fun to stimpak them many times. I really enjoyed the event and went out with tons of screws!!
---
OP just sucks and wants to complain, lol.
---
I’ve had three sets now for no reason. And I’m getting SCORE when I enter power armor as well, at random intervals.
---
Scaling or just putting a timer of 10 minutes on you after completing the event before you can join that same event again.
---
Yea you get it from the bos quest line
---
Good thinking. I’m trying to get to the raider tree on the legendary run but don’t know if I’ll make it in time. If it works later when I try I’ll remember to leave a post here. See ya and good luck.
---
I agree with your point - as a 270 I’ve had wildly different experiences with colossal from being the third wheel to two guys just main-lining the event and doing it in 10 minutes to your situation where I was the highest level player and it was a 20 minute ordeal.
---
That said I think that it underlies another issue with these events and that is a lack of imagination along with catering to specific builds.
---
Everyone’s talking bullet sponges and so on but really it fundamentally comes down requiring high DPS builds and bloodied or a combo to rule the day. I’m a high level but my stealth sniper gauss rifle isn’t going to do along vs these types of events. My secondary is a very nice punchy gauss shotgun - but I obviously don’t have the strength perks to make it fully reach its potential.
---
So I’m a high level but am I really helping out as much as those high DPS/bloodied builds? Nope.
---
So while these events absolutely should exist as they are what I want to see from Bethesda is something that favours the skills that other builds have. Give me a sneak vault I’ve got to get through and nail a series of mutated targets, or some James Bond level sniping on a timer. Something where a higher perception gives you an advantage in that you can critically see something important about the next wave or next type of mutation the same thing can be done for the other special stats.
---
That’s what I’m looking for - don’t cater the events to just shooting something but or necessarily create one that just favours snipers. But bring in elements of SPECIAL where a team of varied builds is just going to do better - reward variety and teamwork.
---
Wait by the entrance until the remainder of the team finish him off. You'll still get the event rewards which include a 3-star, flux and either a cursed weapon or a plan. It's not as nice as looting him and the spawns, but it's something anyway.
---
I'm a noob with what I think is low level damage but I wanna see it too. Is that a crime? (I am level 62 now if that matters) I used all the ammo I could and kept my friend with insane damage safe from spawns (he has a bloodied build and can get easily clapped even tho he is already 130lvl). Let us noobs enjoy life. We get hate on every game for being noobs but damn am I supposed to not play games I want just coz' I'm ass.
---
I know it's just one event but it's so damn cool and I mostly run around reviveing high levels who get kicked by Earl so I am helping. So are other noobs. I personally want low levels to see everything and often drop them some stims and such to help. It's an online game, you can't pick and choose. Only ones that annoy me are the ones that clap legendaries in events. I smack a legendary and keep telling people to come there so everyone can have a chance while there are players who just shoot and it sucks. Like I probably don't want that shitty thing but it vould drop my dream gun and it could drop others their dream guns.
---
You know, I was wondering about this. The other day I saw like 4 or 5 pending friend requests from people I don't remember in my social menu, had to close it out because I was taking damage from one of those never-ending meat week mole rats, and when I went back to the social menu, they were just gone. It's been days and I still haven't been able to see those requests, and even if I could, there's no telling how long they've been sitting there waiting for me to do something with them.
---
Why not both? Sneak and Escape Artist for the everyday wasteland wandering and swap in Adrenaline for fights with lots of trash. You can even work it to get that first shot in before swapping perks if you're daring and not all thumbs like I am.
---
Tenderizer plan so you can get legendary versions. I've already gotten two legendary tenderizers, though both have been one stars.
---
Man I found out the hard way. All day I saw people at the mine chilling with no event up (after I saw the event marker the first time) and wondered what they were all doing.
---
Finally, I fibgured Beth may have done some dumb shit so I fast travelled in anyways and managed to get into the event!
---
I am pissed I missed the other ones earlier on though. I deeply want that stupid mole mask lol
---
By putting opinions out there it allows devs to see how people in the games community are finding their game. It promotes change and development. Everyone is entitled to their opinion and to speak their views. What you're doing, telling someone they should not speak their mind is not right.
---
I think Beth would consider your experiences a success. It’s just a single player game that you got your money’s worth out of.
---
Should they shoot for something more? Maybe.
---
I usually just out sprint them with speed demon mutation and jump away with marsupial
---
Letting skins have advantages is a slippery slope for Atomic Shop.
---
Depends on the color. Some are craftable. I believe pink is rare.
---
Gimme.
---
Glowing meat steak? There probably is something better but that one is so easy to craft.
---
You don't know me or my motives whatsoever.
---
Yeah. I haven't played it yet (and won't for a while now that I know what an ammo sink it is), but I've showed up a couple of times to try to get in just to see what it's like. It's natural to see an event and want to try it out. 
---
Having a higher level is no guarantee of anything either. I am over 150 and have been using a pistol build. It's only since meat week that I have been considering changing that up. I've got heavy weapons, but I only switch to them in dire circumstances. The rate at which I'm running through the ammo tells me that I need to respec to make each bullet do more damage. That is probably a no-brainer for most people, but in most games I've been able to lean on my favorite weapon and use it for everything. I'm sure I'm not the only one who isn't used to having to respec.
---
That's one of the main things I wanted too.....Got those like last week I think.......Meat week has helped with that a lot......I really want that space suit PA and the hidden door fireplace........I don't know how much time we still have though but I hope I can get it.......And cool I'll look forward to it if you remember and I'll try too
---
I so far have just taken the games word for it, it said whatever cap for Primal Cuts and since then I do it, and despite somewhere I have indeed died, I also leveled a bit and got better at contributing without being cannon fodder most of the time.  
---
So I just use that as a measuring stick and after I pass it I join in...the game is for playing after all.  
---
Although during that I have never been revived then I just respawn anyway, I know I got my ass kicked, I'll pay for it lol.
---
I agree with the TS about packing a lot of ammo because you go through the majority of it. I brought a bloodied Gauss Minigun, .50 cal machine gun, minigun with loads of ammo and went through most of it. You can never have enough ammo!
---
Communist collectron finds me plenty of blood packs. If you have him switch him to find weapons in the computer
---
good thing you can add friends and join them ya stick in the fucking mud
---
I like this concept. With additions other are proposing here, it be a hell of a game to play for sure.
---
Stay tuned! we are definitely keen on trying for a queen speedrun as well
---
Yes, you can go right back into sneak with it, it muffles noises ect...
---
Pink, indigo, and yellow cannot be crafted and are pretty HTF. Don’t scrap it, as you cannot learn the color.
---
This is false information.  I have been online for XB1 at reset multiple times and NEVER had the autocomplete occur.
---
Bobbleheads, cooked meats that give melee damage, fury, whiskey with party boy/girl 3*, nuka shine
---
Every build has its place, at least it should. I'm a bloodied stealth commando and I welcome the damage nerf with open arms. Perfect harmony would be tanks being at the front while stealth builds dps the boss, meele builds handling the mobs. But you shouldn't hate on a build because of one jackass trying to get a response out of you.
---
You're mixing up scrap boxes and stash boxes. At any rate, people pay to have unlimited scrap with FO1st, why would Bethesda suddenly start giving it away for free? Lol
---
Just do it, you can help keeping others alive with stimpaks if everything else fails. Everyone loves getting revived anyway. And bruh it's so cool ya gotta see it. (No one really minds low damage if they themselves actually are high damage.) I join that shit everytime and kill the small bois and smack my high damage friend with stimpaks. Its fun, and you can get a disgusting skin pelt. Worth it.
---
You're basically asking for a scrapbox without the scrapbox. That's never happening.
---
Is there no voice chat in game?
---
I used to give 10mm ammo away for 0 caps in my vendor. Then I got a 90%rw 10mm auto pistol I use to tag legendaries. Now I would prob take some of your free 10mm ammo, not all.
---
I did it with a friend on a private server, just the two of us. Medic shotgun build and heavy PA build. (I used T60 for the fight) 
---
Earle is no harder than the SBQ to fight, at least he is on the ground!
---
I used about 2500/3k minigun rounds and maybe 2000 50 cal rounds, including the silo run beforehand so it's not too much of a resource sink. 
---
We went down once each, both to acid or something, but never died. 
---
Just keep moving around the room in circles and don't bunch up, you'll be grand :)
---
One good reason would be if you don't have the plans for those items, they stick out like a sore thumb in your inventory.
---
Chances are an otherwise-clean player is not going to go under review anyway, but different people manage risk differently. I certainly wouldn't want any items I'm not supposed to have.
---
I ran the event with my Junkie shotgunner and 308 screws later the event just failed. But that many screws is a win in my book.
---
I'd buy one if I saw it so I could display it. The level doesn't matter.
---
I did, got nonsense, got the mask though at least and Flux I don't really need tbh I've got plenty and I barely use them thanks to the GP being Prime so ammo is cheap
---
I've actually joined the event late. I looked for someone in a public team that had space, joining the team and then fast traveling to team memmber in the event.
---
The inside area is so small so I guess it would lag with all the wendigos spawning. It is bethesda, they can not handle that.
---
Max lvl coloured baseball bats. Yellow, pink , indigo
---
It is very OP and you're right although as someone who is using the T-65 with an excess of 600 DR I shouldn't be melted
---
He's the real 'Raider' of the game you might say lol. :)
---
I already have two cursed harpoon guns. Ones in my vendor and the other got scripped.
---
There's like 3 threads on this topic and no one pointing out that one wasteland will supposedly fix the issue.
---
I'm guessing that drop is not guaranteed? If so I really need to get back on DaGuerre. Her quest line I mean.
---
To be fair though I don't want everyone arbitrarily joining the Enclave just to do new events.
---
It’s that helmet that everyone’s gonna want.
---
Right? If this guy can break into a vault meant to withstand a nuclear blast, he should have no trouble clearing a bit of rubble.
---
I tried it out yesterday wondering the same thing. They are not. They probably should though. Earl too since that chicken legged motherfucker glows red and is pretty damn tanky.
---
So...what I'm reading is a lvl22 dude wearing a skirt and branding a pipe-pistol should be fine then, right?
---
You has luck, the time I was online at reset I had the autocomplete
---
It should but Bethesda isn't going to anytime in the near future. They made that very clear during a MassivelyOP interview - PC's just not important enough to dev for directly.
---
I’m level 60 and pretty under leveled for the event but I joined one yesterday and basically was trash mob control. Shotguns do wonders on the wendigos
---
Glowing meat steak and Yao guai ribs
---
Lmao savage
---
I'd be down with local text chat, can't say I'd want a global chat like in mmo's unless there is an option to hide it
---
Challenge is good but more grinding is not. if it's going to turn out to become a resource chore hunt for more bullets I'm pretty sure many people are just going to move on. The game will soon be 2 years old. They can easily redeem this by small changes, but will they?
---
Im a melee build, BUT have a gaitling rifle as second weapon.   Death claw for ADs, rifle for Earl.   Seems to be working...
---
Not that many people use it because it sucks as a character to character chat too.
---
For the many many months I've used it, all I ever see is either trade chat or just bored people talking about inane shit. There's zero character to character interaction - the main reason people state that we need chat for.
---
Wow!!
---
really? thought he was tougher.
---
I'm not arguing that, Bethesda could've done better with lvl locks or they waiting on balance patch to fix the issues instead. 
---
But right now can't blame people for joining when the game says join. 
---
My problem is just the dude messaging someone calling him useless and then com banning him...
---
Take a deep breath and relaxe. I have some good news for you...this event will still be accessible tomorow and every other days. If you going nuts over it, don't blame the devs bro...
---
Take a deep breath.
---
The score you accumulate while in PA does not show up on screen until you pop out of PA. This is a known issues. 
---
As far as the Raider PA, no clue unless it’s a random reward from doing some of Rose’s quest line.
---
I'd rather not have to do a ton of extra work for a nocturnal rolling pin that blocks 8% of pvp damage 75% of the time and gives bonus ap while aiming in vats.
---
The most memorable moment for me of getting my ass kicked was guided meditation a couple weeks back, recommended level 25, i was late 30s or early 40s facing level 65 ghouls. 
---
Since then I’ve gotten a lot of levels but still get my ass kicked. At this point it’s my fault because I’ve waited till post level 50 to actually work on a build instead of my “f it it just works” attitude.
---
Lmk 5 keys and counting up...
---
I think 3rd person is where it's at with this game. Helps me sneak way better than being first person. Just more of a view.
---
I use the luck of the draw tier 3. Significantly cuts down my time repairing my heavy and automatic guns. With a casual playstyle I get enough repair kits from the Queen to cover when I do need to repair.
---
If you look at the comments people have mentioned it. I just think it’s a lazy fix.
---
Yup, that's been my experience too and is why I don't use it anymore.
---
Seriously,why bash new players?
---
On my first run got a 3 star bloodied War Drum. Most stuff has been pretty regular since then.
---
Lol. Let's not overstate how the mod is like.
---
I've yet to see a single conversation in local chat, trade chat and global have ok activity but it's almost the same 3-4 people I see at any given time.
---
You're much better off having a discord overlay in a Fallout 76 channel than the text chat mod.
---
That is the only tenderizer plan I even got. I haven't gotten the plan for the weapon or any of the other mods. I've got about a hundred chally costumes though.
---
I do have over 100 stimpaks on me and often focus on healing others if I see them go down. I might stock up on 5mm and fusion cores then either run a silo later or just wait until it gets nuked again.
---
I've done it two times and got the meat pile first then the plushie the second time. No cursed weapons yet but that's ok.
---
Those are the consequences you face by running a bloodied build. If you want to die less, then sacrifice some damage for defense.
---
You're the player, this is a choice you've got to make. You don't get to expect everything to be easier to accommodate you.
---
Yeah, true that. Can they guarantee a non-shitty legendary drop? Lol
---
Ugh I still need the spicy and other one I got the pepper right after I traded a fixer plan for the tenderizer plan
---
I’ve had three sets now, and I’m also getting it when I enter power armor.
---
I can do that.   But how much damage do I have to do to the boss first to get loot from him at the end?  Or is it just a tag situation.
---
Depending on the gun I use I can get to 20 per shot
---
Cursed shovel is the most fun i got from melee ever :D
---
Bruh just go in its fun, I do it with my friend and I'm just a 62lvl junkie and I'm fine just killing the spawns off of everyones asses. My friend is lvl 130 and helps melt him pretty good. You don't have to be insane levels to be there. And it's okay if it fails once in a while anyway, someone will launch a new nuke. (The ones I have been in haven't failed yet so no worries. Even a noob like me can carry my weight, you can do it by melthing wendigo spawns and rezzing the melters.)
---
Do you speak spanish?
---
Then you may want to also max out class freak (in luck) to minimize all those side effects.
---
&gt; everything is there except for the flux of course. That sucks but what do you expect from people you are competing against.
---
You haven't played long, have you? Flux is gone because you died, not because someone took it.
---
Will your character automatically use them if you push the stimpack button and are carrying only those, or do you need to hotkey the salves?
---
The difficulty of the event isn't the core issue, it is the rewards not matching the effort put into the event
---
Well, I’d spend the whole day leveling up. Lol.
---
Sounds like quite the eventful day.  I've gotten stuck like that quite a few times in NW but never lucky enough to stay in the circle
---
I thought the high levels can one shot kill everything and do the event in like a minute? Who cares if lower levels join then. Go on your private servers.  That's what a PUBLIC event is. Wow the since of entitlement from some of you.
---
I'm at 450 and if any sub level 50's want to do the event with me, they are always welcome.  I'll stim them when they fall and I'll do enough damage to carry us both.  IDK why you guys are always bitching about the low levels.. Embrace them.
---
Yeah I think I’m going to stock up on 5mm and fusion cores after I’ve done some NW. During the event I will definitely focus on the spawns and reviving anyone who needs it. Might even go to the rusty pick to see if I can roll some better legendaries before heading out. 
---
(Side note hey fellow PS4 player)
---
Yeah, that sounds perfect! You go my man
---
Did it yesterday for the first time. Was tanking the colossus in power armor but the random wendigos are definitely the worse problem. At one point I had no lie about 15 of them attacking me at once because noone was dealing with them. Died as the event finished so it spawned me outside and didn't get to loot Earle, was pretty annoyed but at least I got the mining helmet. Next time I play I'm going to do it on my other character in stealth just dealing with the trash mobs.
---
They literally said that. Before the game released. Yet people *still* got upset at the lack of NPCs. 
---
On the subject of things they said before release; the whole "16x the detail," thing that everyone was upset about? People seemed to ignore the part where Todd says the *engine allows* for 16x detail. He didnt say FO76 would have it, just that the engine upgrades were that big. But, as always, "Bethesda bad!"
---
I agree. I’m all for inclusion but it think it’s best for the game and community to start having actual end game content and respects some kind of level system instead of everything being recommended . The one wasteland will ruin content like this and should only be for open world and side quests
---
Thank you for the clarification! I appreciate knowing. I was never really sure if they were working or not because, yeah, they get busted pretty easily.
---
That flamer sounds interesting
---
What IS a magic shotgun?
---
Dude level 42 is ok, I was around level 40 when I first did colossal problem, I didn't even know how hard it was gonna be.  But I stimpaked like 5 people who were high levels and I think that counts for something.
---
Yes.    
---
However, you need Starched Genes (available at 30) maxed rank 2. So you don't lose them when using Radaway in any form. Rad-X will temporarily turn them off so I drop/sell any I get.    
---
Class Freak is stupidly available at 46 I think. At max rank 3 it reduces any negative problems from such mutations at 75%. Bookmark this for future reference:    
---
[https://aridenkane.com/fallout-76-mutations-list/](https://aridenkane.com/fallout-76-mutations-list/)    
---
I would be patient and look for player vendors who sell them for a lower cost. The plans for them are 5 figures. Trying to randomly get what you want and avoid the others is a time sink and not worth pursuing.    
---
My main char is a Stealth Sniper and has Marsupial and Bird Bones. I got Eagle Eyes serum yesterday before I logged off. When using serums you must unequip Starched Genes or it has no effect and you've still used the serum. Don't rush it. Always make sure Starched Genes and Class Freak are equipped.
---
Just... no one else was there. There were plenty of people outside in the area around the mine ...just no one inside with me. Which was pretty terrifying.
---
Bad news for ya', you're playing the wrong fucking Fallout. But, I too am a masochist, and refuse to participate in the things i want to do, and choose instead to throw myself at the things i don't want to do.
---
But Communism ewww. They need to make a Responder-tron that find health items
---
I've still been focused on the meat cook for plans but have seen so many stability issues since the patch. Lots of server disconnects yesterday when there's an active Earl or SBQ event on PS4. I'm seeing the same thing though, sound is there but screen and controls frozen. Feels bad for those players. All weekend it was smooth sailing. My hands are ruined from so much drumming.
---
They're not hard to find.    
---
Early game at Poseidon Energy Plant on the roof of the left building there are two of those small one room shelter things. There is usually one inside but if there isn't server hopping will save time.
---
There's a good one in discord that does PC, ps4 and xbox
---
SBQ events anyone
---
Well i'm on PS4 too. 
---
I think i could do better if actually the event could be more fruid. The framedrops are absolutly terrible for me, i can barely see what's going in around me. I don't know for you.
---
I like the event, it's challenging, i can't wait for the daily ops, but if i keep experiencing this type of gaming experience it's not gonna work for me.
---
The Collosus also fall under the man once killed. It make it very difficult to loot him. I couldn't find him on my first two runs :(
---
Me playing a gunslinger:  im in danger
---
I can send u a message with the invite if ur interested
---
This.  They usually do everything they can.  That's all you can ask.
---
The fact isn't worth arguing but the Grocer's Backpack is the best and it shows in comments !!!  Hands down !! Anyone that says otherwise is a more casual than hardcore 76er.
---
There's one scoreboard for your account that all characters share. Any consumables you redeem will be only for that character (like caps, lunchboxes, scrip) but the camp items and outfits are for all characters regardless of which one you used to redeem it.
---
Yeah it was pretty cramped, and it did lag alot seemed like it was me throwing nuka grenades that caused it though lol
---
Excactly. I love noobs. I always give them some stimpaks and such when they greet me in the wild. They are so damn happy about a few purified waters and such. Its great
---
I sell them 2 caps to vendor... Cant hold junk otherwise people take it off me
---
I'm not good at it, but...
---
Donde esta la biblioteca?
---
You likely still have one uncompleted in your quest log. Likely a shitty rescue.
---
Bruh lmao
---
When I regularly played Fallout 4, my biggest gripe was the fact that in Fallout 4 you had to work to display your stuff, unlike in Skyrim (the only previous Bethesda title I'd played up to that point) where you could load an ass ton of books into a bookcase and it'd display the books, or just assign some things to a weapon's display or armor display and it'd display it just fine. To get items to display in Fallout 4 you had to man handle them into position and hope, just hope that you'd release them at just the right point where they wouldn't go crashing to the floor. To get functionality similar to what we'd had in Skyrim you needed a mod (OCD Decorator off the top of my head).
---
I just took the long way round to saying that we can't have really good displays in Fallout 76 because we never had them in Fallout 4 and since Fallout 76 is just a tweaked version of Fallout 4 no good displays for us.
---
All good lol I'm not freaking out or nothing just kind of wondering how it's been working for different people seems pretty random as far as I can tell so far lol I know I got plenty of time just wondering around how much of that time it's going to take lol
---
Nah they're all random. This is man is a lucky duck.
---
That's part of the reason I'm not motivated to use a nuke on that event. I'd rather trigger Scorched Earth. At least when it's not my nuke, I can log off when it becomes obvious there's no chance of killing Earle off in time, that the other people are just going to stay cowering in a corner, not even willing to pick off the wendigos swarming me. Before logging off I like to get as many of the wendigos following me, leading them to their little corner and let them get swarmed before bailing.
---
They're even worse than semi auto rifles.
---
Agreed I had play gta a bit yesterday waiting for the update, it seemed like everyone was mad at eachother for no reason.
---
You can get it more than once. I learned my first one then got another right after. Have now got 3 total
---
I think that the souvenir stein is the only plan you can't learn more than once.
---
Got 3 in the row with my main. The answer is yes you can still get it
---
Oh sorry, i think that you was other person... sorry
---
giving the prime meat doesnt progress the meatcook event, it just gives you extra scrip, just fyi
---
Well i can say that your best bet for fast levels is to go to primal cut events with a gun that has tons of ammo and just shoot every enemy a couple times. But make sure you have people with you so you aren't alone but everything that you shot at will give you xp and loot when it dies. Btw I'm on xbox if you want to play.
---
Ye that happened the second time I killed him too. I experience the odd frame drop but not too often. I also like the challenge but I die too often because I end up running into the hazards around when he does the scream lol. I find it very fun. I've already done it 6-7 times and it's very fun but I feel bad for everybody because I'm always dieing.
---
👍✌
---
I agree with you. Not worth it. Especially since i found all the new rewards already from player vendors for total of \~5000 caps or so.
---
I like to hang them on the branches of the hanging cage tree.
---
Pandapool, ain't a fool, and I'm the best at what I do!
---
Yes. Have all your alts learn it. Let’s flood the market with Legendary Tendies!
---
Oh wow that’s pretty cool
---
Sure it's not a magic effect?
---
Make the gun a few times and scrap them
---
Not optimizing gameplay?  How the hell is it my fault if someone runs in front of my Explosive weapon and I die?  You do realize people die for reasons beyond "Not being careful", "Bad Perks", blah.  What about someone who is maybe a lower level and can't do much damage so they devote themselves to stimming downed players in the event.  Should they be penalized so harshly if they die trying to save someone at the end of the event.  Come on man.
---
Ok, I killed it too in like a minute with randoms, what exactly is a magic weapon? And what a hacked weapon?
---

---
And btw, trading in not allowed on this sub. Against the rules.
---
No thanks.
---
Ah ok thanks
---
Yeah this right here is what to do. Join a team for the bonus xp and make sure there’s other higher level players and tag everything. Easy xp.
---
Whenever I do ally dailies I get pipe pistols :(
---
Is this real life? Is this just fantasy?
---
It could entice people into gambling for real tho... And inspire people to sell caps for real money, which is against ToS. Bad idea I think
---
Have yet to be in there with a full eight people. 
---
Fun story, last night the thing just left. We were chipping away at him and all of the sudden hes half way off the ground, then a few seconds later hes just gone.
---
Was nuts.
---
My PvP build is complete. I’m level 59. Wanna test it?
---
I'm for anything that makes games less boring. And bosses on "Farm Status" are boring. Super boring.
---
If having low levels in the event makes it more unpredictable and harder to complete that's fine and welcomed.
---
There are already plenty of players out there that seem to more or less  have this fight down to less than a minute and sometimes you end up in a team with them.
---
You win some, loose some. The human factor :)
---
It's a trap. This guy's gonna eat you.
---
both
---
So I get that even if the event fails then.
---
You have a point, I was just arguing for the sake of realism.
---
Excavator for sure should at least have a bright mod.
---
T-65/Ultracite should any headlamp that combat power armor can use.
---
I didn’t think about displaying it, I’m gonna do that!
---
I'll take an awkward UI over those performance issues any day.
---
Haha, nice, meanwhile i launched a nuke yesterday, got in there with one random, even thou the event mark said 6 people participate, we wasted all our ammo, and took like quarter of his life... random left, i had nothing, didnt play the game since.... i have nothing for a bloddied build, so i guess im screwed.
---
Yeah, it's instant, unless you good over the 1000scrip limit, then you get nothing
---
If you really are a new player and not just playing a new character, don't rush the levelling up. You'd be essentially sprinting towards and end game that doesn't exist.
---
To get the most out of the game, you're best of exploring each area as much as possible before moving on. It also prevents you from hitting a difficulty wall where you're outmatched by the enemies you come across.
---
I know but I just find it hilarious also if he had it a Chinese stealth suit woulda worked right it’s like a hazmat but actual armor?
---
Giving cosmetic items stat boosts is going to start treading the line of pay to win
---
Workin until 3,but if your not busy wit the fam/RL later on...
---
We could try N rock a quick one or two,
---
I’ll have from like 4 until 6 to play,&amp; maybe a smidge if time after the kids are sleepin.
---
Cool! It will look good! 😄
---
That or look for these rolls , je minigun and blimb minigun. These two for sure are magic as I use them everyday. They work on the colossus too.
---
More data points is always a good thing.
---
If you’re on Xbox I had same problem and doing a proper hard reset fixed the issue
---
Ok thanks didnt know that.
---
A magic weapon is a weapon that does way more damage then it should based on its effects - Angry Turtle on YT does a great job explaining 
---
Hacked weapons are weapons injected into the game that shouldnt be in :)
---
uhh... that's not a scrapbox
---
To your point of reality, I would say there is no reason for someone who can fully use an automatic rifle, to not be able to use a semi auto one.  Or pistols for that matter.
---
It's cute that your complaining about something that you obviously can find a solution to, from what I'm seeing, but text chat should be an option ON ALL PLATFORMS, not just PC. All other MMORPG have this option, but we are all forgetting one thing; Bethesda used the same engine to make Skyrim AND Fallout 4, so unless they can find a way to implement it into the game, you shouldn't complain when you have options. Complain only when you don't, like console players who can't use mods and are stuck using emotes or some ridiculous phone app (if that option is even possible)
---
Its a mistake. Its going to introduce a ton of problems I cant even begin to fathom now. I have played all of Bethesdas other games and they love bulletsponges. In Skyrim for instance their idea of a harder game was to give you less damage and enemies more health. Kind of what they are doing now. Who knows what kind of new magic strange effects we will see from this.
---
your courage has not gone unnoticed. thank you.
---
If it helps mate I also went in with my Junkies Heavy char and that was quite a smooth fight :)
---
In which case, pistols and semi auto/bolt action guns should just be a part of commando.
---
To be fair, it does sound like you were being a cunt.
---
You can hang the antler chandelier from the branches as well
---
loot everything, scrap, bulk, equip hard bargain, and sell to bot vendors.  Even things like mutfruit, flowers, etc you normally run past are work 1c each.
---
FWIW, I never had more than about 1k caps until past L50, averaged about 5k at 100.  Now over 200, and I'm regularly buying stuff I don't need just to keep from bumping against the cap limit.
---
And then they returned it to the way it was before.
---
First time I did hers I got one of the best 3* (Vampiric 50cal) I've ever gotten. She's given me nothing but garbage since. She needs to take an aspirin and start handing out more good stuff.
---
I see what you did there
---
Check your score through your map.  It should not be changing and the HUD ui is just catching up.  The bar does not normally appear at all when you are either in power armor, or rather when any ui that is not the base is present.  
---
IE, after leaving my PA when the score catches up, if I trace over the frames inventory, the bar disappears again.
---
You're not getting free score, it's just that there are two separate bars.  The one on the map is accurate to current, and the one on the HUD queues updates as challenges are completed.
---
Trust me. Bethesda would not be giving you something that they charge for for free.
---
Did you try unplugging it for 30 seconds?
---
The hardest part in this game is still soloing a silo without sneak for me, I won't die.. but the repairs will nag on me.
---
All these big monsters usually don't do much dmg imo
---
A shotgun that is imbued in the arcane arts. Like if Harry Potter traded his wand in for a 12 gauge.
---
I fuckin love the bumper sword
---
I recently changed my build around. Use to have it to where I had high strength and perception and intelligence but I started changing it once I got a bloodied combat rifle to drop from enemy. I started realizing how much damage I could do. So I switched my perks around to give my agility 15. All the sneak perks are amazing when you want high damage so I recommend all the sneak cards if you want high damage hits
---
I like you already 😏
---
I only died like 4 times before I got 60 secs
---
That myside is a very good idea as I have around 2k of it and live in the ash heap, 
---
It's so pretty a bucketwheeler to my rear &amp; a dragline to my front + a lead farm and a blood eagles camp I can direct mortar fire too.
---
Hoora Brother!!!
---
i just watched a video of these guys taking down Earle in 12 seconds, no cheats or exploits. thinking i might rearrange my perks and try this. Here is the link:

---
What level should you be before being able to join ACP? I'm 107 and haven't attempted to join, but I'm interested in giving it a whirl at some point.
---
They are bringing back a surviving (i.e. AWOL) member of the Appalachian BOS for Daily Ops. Surely they could write that one or two OoM members were in the wind during Olivia's murder spree.
---
Pretty much, at least when it comes to the bosses and Daily Ops.
---
It's somewhat disingenuous when people do their tests solely in the overworld and proclaim there's nothing wrong.  There, yes, your Rifleman can still 2-3 shot things.  But there's little pressure in the overworld.  For things like Daily Ops, on the other hand, you're going to be destroyed if you can't hit quickly enough.
---
This seems like something I would do, if I could drop a nuke haha damn that hurts
---
If your gonna farm, farm Civil War Top Hat or Marine Tactical helmet plans.
---
CWTH takes 1 cloth and vendors for 30 caps, MTH needs rubber, glass, plastic and vendors for 27 caps.
---
Last time I did the event was with only me and two other players, and one was idling at the entrance for the whole time...
---
We actually like that you play with your dad, no need to get defensive about it.
---
Member, we do not turn down cannon fodder.  Use the tools before you throw them away.
---
No.u cant
---
Well, at least you weren’t chicken....
---
That would be awesome and kinda makes sense
---
Don't forget to plug it back in after
---
There are only 24 players per server.  If the event was level capped you probably would have been alone and this post would be complaining about no one joining the event.  It sounds like you just got a server where no higher levels wanted to join the event.  One Appalachian will make all participants more useful.
---
As a lower level player who recently started the game, I have to believe that is the intention.  Their attempts to balance the games for the multipliers made even early fights nearly impossible for someone without enough perks or good gear.   I only was able to turn the corner because another player gifted me armor &amp; a weapon significantly better than what I could grind in the game.
---
Totes obvs
---
It doesn't bother me. It's a Fallout game with survival elements, survival-lite, if you will. So, weights, hydration, sleep and being fed come part and parcel with the game.
---
I don't think there'd be any harm in giving another 400 kg(?) total weight to camp storage. But in reality, Beth can do no right whatever they put the cap at. Raise it to high, and the FO1st members will moan. Too low, and the we want to store EVERYTHING we find gang won't be happy.
---
I really hope Nuclear Winter gets some love from the devs soon. I love it and I would hate to see it dumped like Survival Mode.
---
You'd be surprised
---
I can actually see both sides of this argument, but I have to agree with OP. I did this yesterday and it's really a pain in the butt. When the boss is LVL 110, it's unlikely that anyone who's just a LVL 40 which is the minimum recommended level to join the event is going to last very long or be very effective at it. If the event weren't limited to just 8 players, I'd agree more with you, but with that kind of a limit and the difficulty of the enemies, there's not much room for LVL 40 players to actually survive the onslaught from all of the wendigos as well as the attacks from boss. 
---
The match I(LVL 287) was in yesterday only had maybe 5 or 6 players, I spent most of the match trying to avoid being mobbed by the wendigos running around, at one point I think I had about 7 wendigos on me chasing me, lots of jumping around and shooting at them. We failed the event, we barely wore the boss down, it's listed as 'Very Hard' and it actually was. I've never gotten a 45 second respawn in any event, so that was a first, too.
---
You need different skills to use a rapid fire weapon dishing out a load of recoil than you do to be a sniper, and handguns tend to be smaller, less powerful. Therefore easier to use.
---
The event happen EVERY hour (on the hour). Just go there, before the event pops. Fast travel to Vault 76 for free. At \*:55 , then get on a drum or spit till the event starts and the 2 minute cool down happens. (FYI beating a drum or turning a spit during that 2 minutes will raise the bar, also having 3 on spit and 3 on drums provides and additional bonus.)
---
I've loosened my mind to it.
---
Just think of it as a communist tricked into working for free for a capitalist lol
---
Yea main wasnt.... i wasted an hour for nothing basically. Im done with this event until they at least let people join in mid event, like SBQ. I even wanted to come back with some more ammo after i had to leave, but only came to like 10 people near the entry, all angry emoting. Disheartening af... ive been grinding ammo for months now, went thru almost half of it, without getting a single thing in return. Im not launching a single nuke on that mine anymore...
---
I got 3 stein plans on my mule. Had to drop two as you can't trade them
---
Mine got stuck right at the start, doesn't allow me to progress
---
Very impresive! 
---
Question, having seen what you can do to the hardest enemy in the game, do you think the upcoming rebalance is ok?
---
If you can stay around the machineries, in the middle of the room, you have a pretty good chance to avoid the fire, or whatever that is, droping from the celling. Personally i just stand against a wall ( well...a big console/machinery ) and shoot him from there. So when he scream, i'm basically running against it and avoid all the stuff droping from the celling. My main issue is because of the framedrops a eventualy lose sight on the amount of Wendigos around us.
---
Nice!!!! Hope all the people who go "but bloodied you just die all the time!!" see this.
---
I would say that is actually a lot of times to die - if you’re dying 4 times on an event then perhaps you’re under prepared for it. Ideally you’d not die at all, if you’re struggling then maybe you die 1-2 times. But any more than that and it might indicate some work needs to be done to avoid dying so much!
---
Bloodied really doesn't need Sneak. You're plenty sneaky with all of the Agility already.
---
I mean, isn't that what everyone did? What's more likely: someone buying this game and saying "I am joining the Enclave, because I just love that E logo, and I have a burning desire to play as a member of that faction"? Or that someone realizing that joining the Enclave = dropping nukes and did it for that reason?
---
Its an interesting one but I think it will be a long term positive as they have said the main reason is to make balance changes easier to implement in future :)
---
Bet he spilled a drink on it
---
You have to learn it first.
---
Why is there suddenly an influx of these posts?
---
Ok.would be cool if we could
---
Wait is a colossal problem out? I haven’t played the game for a bit
---
I like the part where Bethesda released a single boss and called it content.
---
Ah that'll be why then, i didn't learn it until i noticed i had 3 of them
---
jfc and people are complaining that the game will be too hard when they nerf stacking bonuses lmfao
---
Yeah idk I just figured I would switch it up. I was doing decent damage already but I said I’m going to go all in. So I have 14 strength because I’m still a hoarder. I believe I’m 11 or 10 perception 4 endurance 1 charisma 3 intelligence 15 agility and 8 luck

It seems to happen if she gets staggered while flying, causing her animation to reset, and she never lands.  You can see it happen to her in mid air.  It pretty much comes down to the One Gun Army perk.  If all the heavy gunners just take that off, she wont stagger so much.  That or just stop shooting her until she lands.
---
I'm actually going full-on Mistress of Mysteries with my alt.
---
Doesn't matter the range, automatic fire is only used for suppression in real life.
---
working the public team system to your advantage helps. the team leader has to be there to enter the mine, so that helps not to get put with randos (even though the team is basically randos, you can see their level and see where they are on the map) I typically hop building or event teams based on who shows up or if I feel like I can get them to come to the event by emoting in a public team. They can see your emote in the team panel (follow me! follow me!) AKA get your ass to the mine. Done it two or three times this way and only once was the event really close and I was probably a weak link (lvl 180 and ran out of plasma cores, doh!).
---
You know how the squatter quest procs for everyone at the moment, and you get all the rewards even though you’re the other side of the map? Or how fees the people used to give canned meat to everyone on the server? Do you think it could be happening with Roses quest? So when someone completes it, everyone in the server gets power Armor?
---
Let's just assume everyone has magic guns 🙄
---
Nice
---
Earle is like the SBQ, where he gets more health the more people are in the event. When you have the full 8 people he's beefy as hell. But if you do the event with only 2 or 3 people. You can watch his health slowly drain from one person's attack.
---
Not including magic weapons or hacked guns with laser splitters.
---
That's someone using a hacked weapon most likely.
---
Additionally, Escape Artist eliminates all noise from walking and running (not sprinting), so the Muffled armor leg mods are no longer necessary.
---
Most of the new weapons and armour content added to the game in the beginning (PA suits, LMG, .50 cal, ect) are still unfinished. Getting the cooks to put the cake back in the oven has been hard as the chefs keep throwing fancy breadsticks at us anytime we ask :-/
---
Well seeing as I'm not at the point yet where I can i one shot level 50 supermutants yet and I kept getting ganged up on by wendigos I say 4 deaths isnt a lot and it is not worth a 60 sec wait time and it's not like there's a benefit to purposely die
---
Got mine on second run :)
---
Building them up and scraping is the best way honestly. Think you can find the plans at some vendor bots.use super duper might get a few 2 for 1s.also seems like the higher your intelligence the better the odds.just what I been told
---
Power armor and either a troubleshooters or AA weapon. 
---
IMHO, easier if you run it solo (fewer enemies)
---
go slow.  when you hear the turrets, back up, crouch.  Snipe the turrets to take them out.  (Targeting HUD on your PA helps locate them a bit faster.)
---
The hardest part for me was remembering where the pipe leaks were located.  
---
Failed a couple of times because I didn't find them all in the allotted time.
---
Ye there's a box where I can stand where on the Collosul can hit me. But the scream normly makes me run off into the crowd or Wendigo blew me that tends to kill me
---
I think from what bethesda have said its a necessary change to allow them to balance effectively so Im all for the change :)
---
Bro, nobody is complaining about level 62. I'm 66 and was one of the 2 people carrying when I did my last run yesterday. It's the level 20s that LITERALLY cannot contribute that are a problem. If only 8 people can join, and several of those slots are taken by people who can do absolutely nothing to help, then unless you DO have some cheesy bloodied guy holding it down or someone with magic guns it's very possible to fail the event. I failed one yesterday for this exact reason and losing all that ammo felt real bad.
---
Sorry, forgot there was another one!
---
That sad feeling when you joined the Enclave for the first reason and have never launched a nuke
---
Ssshhh don't tell Chally what kind of meat we cook
---
Make sure you join the team that increases your intelligence. It used to be the builders team but they are changing it to the casual team. Not sure if they made the change yet. A full team will increase your intelligence by 4 which will increase experience gained.
---
Is that why my auto shotty does way more dmg, like 1 shot everything when I hit the head in vats? Same with the barrel shotty but only 2 shots while my auto has 32. The pump action and another 3 star shotty do normal dmg I guess as the enemies usually need one or two more hits to go down.
---
Any level if you're brave enough. And have people who can do it
---
So just curious here. Wouldn’t it be more beneficial to have the all the sneak bonuses on a bloodied character to get max damage? I only ask because I’m starting to hone my character around a sneak bloodied rifle build. Thought I could get a ton of first shot damage to take down most things.
---
Fantastic, that’s great to hear :)
---
Np
---
Most likely yes! :)
---
Ah! I didn’t consider that as a possibility... Nice.
---
I think you’ve proven my point there. Your items and build may just not be up to the event right now - but that’s ok, just means you get to work towards it. If it were not at all punishing then people who have played for a long time would have no advantage over lower level or lower geared players. There has to be some aspect of danger or risk or the game will just be boring.
---
Technically the last level you gain something in stats is 50 so I’ll say 50
---
I agree with that. Shooting her in the air is a massive waste of bullets anyway. I'd like to know why she takes off immediately once she lands as well, that seems to be random also?
---
I was hoping that was the case 👍
---
If you're hidden, you're hidden. You don't get any more damage from being more hidden.
---
Played it a bunch on the PTS. 
---
I’m level 480 and not quite ready yet.
---
I am still amazed how did the devs did not include a zone chat system with an online game.
---
I feel like if you have so much junk in your stash that it’s full all the time, you really need to learn how to manage what you need more. I think the mechanic works just fine in this setting. If you have a problem with overflowing junk there are just obvious things you’re storing that you don’t need tbh
---
I don't know why I didn't realize I could trade in arrows for other ammo.  I have amassed quite a horde of them, so I'll have to spend some time at my ammo converter when I log in tonight.
---
Fantastic, thanks for the heads up 👍
---
If you are asking what level is recommended for the event, I'd say 50+ at least.
---
But any level is welcome to try.  Just do your best, stay out of the way and stim players when they are down.
---
It is a relatively early quest. It's definitely one of the best storyline. Bethesda has its faults, but the game is just massive and lets you do things that are pretty cool. I think the freestates missions are pretty cool, mostly because of Abbie's tapes. Rose is pretty deep storyline about the raiders and the early post war government in Charleston, too, but nearly not as cool as MoM. I liked the investigation one - Bo-peep, black sheep, etc, and going around investigating all the clues.
---
Or people who take the time to run the nukes could nuke where they want to.
---
I think I understand but I’m still a little confused. Perhaps they knew how difficult this concept would be to explain in a Reddit thread and took advantage of it?!....or maybe I’m an idiot. Seriously, though I do think I understand what your saying and that is suspect. 
---
However, and I have not been playing for long so my thinking may change, I don’t mind them charging overcharging for luxury items(anything decorative).
---
My main concerns(sorry for the tangent) are never charging for unique weapons(which as far as I know they haven’t), and figuring out I’m how to eliminate those extremely high powered hacked weapons that some have.
---
Not to take away from your point. They are still scoundrels if the first order! (General first order, not kylo Rens)
---
I liked the new raid mechanics such as area hazards, aoe effects and the fear affect. People just werent prepared for this fight I think. Give it a few days, maybe a week, you'll probably have more luck as time progresses.
---
Great to hear and yes that sounds like a plan lol 😂
---
What exactly?
---
That's what it was, that stein will keep dropping until you learn it, but you can't trade it. I took my other character in there just to get the stein because I had the other steins from Fasnacht on that one- despite never building the display for it.
---
Exactly! That’s the satisfaction the game provides and the entire point of gear / perks / levels. Without that it would be boring.
---
Has anyone enjoyed using the cursed weapons?
---
If you are waiting 60 sec at a time that means you have failed. It was something you consistently did or did not do. You either did not pay attention to your surroundings with your explosive weapon, came unprepared at low level or was not cautious enough.
---
Your whole position translates as "I should never fail no matter what I do." and it's just so wrong.
---
If I die I can't respawn, so I can't play bloodied build. Hoping Bethesda fixes this b-Ahahahaha I couldn't even finish that sentence xD
---
Good answer bud I like that.
---
Now do it again after the nerf. That's why they are adding that damage nerf to those builds.
---
And this right here is the reason everyone is getting nerfed 😂 Good show though 😂
---
This. Absolutely this
---
Using a hunters lmg with bash and 90rw.isnt melting it but it contributes to the damage
---
At least it wasn't a level 20!
---
They also said they're looking into official mod support so if this proceed further, the text chat mod might become officially a thing.
---
a voice over in this event? for me there is none, am i playing the wrong game?
---
It was stressful, but fun. Learning as I go.
---
Duse yea I agree I couldn't kill the boss's by my self but dying only. 4 time and having a 60 sec timer doesn't encourage me to get better it just makes me annoyed and not want to play the game when I have to wait a minute just to play again at an event
---
Or just don’t put a level requirement and group like leveled people with an equally scaled boss
---
Nope, 33 hit chance on a shotgun is surprisingly op. And if they don't die in one hit i've got executioner finishing them off
---
**~~MORE~~** **MOAR DAKKA**
---
**FTFY**
---
50 or higher, but even then I'd rather only see level 100+ players down there. With the level 75 wendigos that spawn, it doesn't seem like a good idea to have low levels down there doing the event
---
Bethesda: nahh
---
What is this bug? And isn't it a good thing to get it autocompleted and enjoy other activities without being haunted by your dailies?
---
Its a server glitch.  You need to server hop to get it done or complete it on a private server. This first or that first doesnt matter.  If someone completed that quest recently on the server it bugs out.  It may take a few or several hops but you can get it done.
---
I would like to be a community manager for Bethesda, especially concerning Fallout 76. Maybe they’d actually do something because I play the game and I can and will constantly push through all the most annoying bugs while “accidentally” forgetting to mention the ones that benefit us.
---
This was a weird take.
---
The difference is that low income people still have value because, ya know, they're people. In a video game with hard numbers there is no intrinsic value to simply being a player if you can't put up the numbers to fight something. If you are level 23 and have a pipe pistol and three frags to your name you literally cannot contribute to this event and can potentially ruin the event for everyone. Your life will be more joyful if you stop searching for and creating subtext in everything.
---
33 vats hit chance is a known magic effect on shotties, and it will be fixed eventually. In reality shotguns suck.
---
I generally try to get to the event about 10 min ahead of time, find grahm, and check for plans i don't have. 
---
A couple times in the first few days of the event, i could not locate grahm.  Didn't see him, didn't hear him.   Waited.  other people showed up.  At the appointed time, the event did not start.  Waited a few more minutes.  Grahm never showed.
---
Conclusion: no grahm=no event.
---
I still get there early and look for grahm.  not there?  Server hop.
---
Move your camp, or save resources to fix it after a nuke.
---
If it's that much of an issue do not build where you can ever be nuked or bring it up with Bethesda in a written report with your concern.
---
Id prefer no nukes in-game to be honest but they are here to stay by the looks of it so we all just need to get by.
---
WAAAGH!
---
You should probably go ahead &amp; move your camp, This is going to be a continuous problem for you.
---
Is complaining about low level exclusive on consoles?   I swear I didn’t see all these low lvl comments when it dropped on PC last week. 
---
I’ve done this several times with low levels.  Havnt failed one yet.
---
Didn’t win it but got a buttload of XP from killing like 200 Wendigos.
---
Thats a different story. Going alone is 1 thing, but going as a group and bailing on the others ,to me, is a dick move
---
Got a cursed exec/FSS/RW shovel last night, next event one of my buddies got the exact same rolls on his own cursed shovel. Don't think they're going to end up being all that rare
---
Tse could possibly make a comeback after the new patch drops.besides the lower accuracy and the fact they break so quickly most tse weapons are pretty decent
---
So weird; I just finished and never had a single autocomplete thought I often played right through the reset.
---
Because the event just came out? Lol
---
As evidenced by the dogshit performance on said consoles? 
---
Bethesda has one of the worst track records when it comes to optimizing games for consoles and that company is suddenly going to focus solely on those? lol
---
Ah so it's actually magic. Hope they don't ruin my super shotty, i love going around exploding people
---
But you could upgrade it to do exactly those things and be the back-room administrator for the new Order. I think the stock faction missions 'go find this missing equipment' gopher assignments could be a lot cooler with CRYPTOS identifying missions or jobs to recover tech, weapons or help people in a bad spot for dailies
---
So it's safe to assume that someone who handles automatic weapons will have no idea what they're doing if given a pistol? Or a sniper rifle?
---
No because you lose the point from them
---
It's hard to say because I've seen both useful 40's and useless 70's during SBQ and ISS fights. 
---
I'd much prefer to have a level 45 clearing trash mobs from the main damage dealers and reviving downed players (and sometimes even holding their own in a fight) over a level 70 using a hunting rifle (which is near useless in these sorts of fights) or using a tesla for the sole purpose to tag as many mobs as possible and then disengage from the fight until the next wave of mobs comes along.
---
I know, they're really fun. This just tells how much love all the weapons need besides heavy guns and commando.
---
Yet another reason to hate on tesla rifles! I hate but respect them.
---
If u die when earl dies, just FT to a teammate that’s still inside.   It should work. It been working for PC anyway.  
---
Also, if u die at end or during exit run.   U do it lose ur junk.   Only lose junk if u die after mine exit timer runs out.
---
Does that actually work? I though you needed to find the weapons to scrap.
---
I didn't see any of these posts the past week when it was PC exclusive. Just found it strange
---
Even if the supershotty isn't very good against scorchbeasts it did kill my man Earle Williams
---
Shoot! Thanks everyone for pointing out. Now I will be a lot more carefull during reset.
---
Someone that is lvl 50 has enough ammo and 3-4 guns.  
---
It is a 8 man raid boss it is a bullet sponge ammo, ammo, ammo and guns along with maybe a backup melee. Yes you get ammo back but unless you are a sneak crit build you will not get enough ammo back to sustain (or a build similar high burst damage low ammo use)  
---
Taking a guess here but it took 30,000 rounds solo to kill him with a magic gun and using -20% ammo used so solo is and again a guess since magic damage is a fickle mistress about 45,000 minigun rounds if you don't have magic and the ammo magazine.
---
How does it work if one event is already full?? Beth said another one would kick off is that true?
---
Hehe I was just kidding.  What you have there looks closer to the pipboy
---
 I was doing a similar thing on the PTS last night, same fixer, similar build, and getting about 30 per hit max and with a team of 3 other guys who were full health power armor builds we just missed finishing in the time limit. 
---
I spent 2k .45 ammo and some 5.56 trying to use a tse (only hit for 9 per shot).
---
I didn't use bobbles or bock but I had psychotats the whole time. I was tearing up the wendigo spawns in quick bursts and only going down when I'd miss the falling fire debris damaging me, but earle is just a sponge.
---
Haven't run this event outside the PTS yet but it sounds a lot more fun.
---
Well every time I ran at earl I died and this happened so often that my respawn Timer was out to 60 sec which is pretty annoying when you’re fighting with two low levels :/ we lost the fight with 10% health left and I was so pissed that I don’t think I will try another fight again
---
there are usually 3 ticks in the moonshiners shack near 76.  several more around the lumber mill just down the hill from there.
---
theres an open field between Monongah power plant and the nearby hotel usually has  with 3 or so in the treeline
---
Theres an unmarked location (quanset hut) in the mire...near the tech data turnin place with 3 or so.
---
no, in future events we just server swap until someone did not build in the area i wanna nuke, like SBQ... i have nuked the base of a friend on privat server, because he went afk and his base was in my blast zone.
---
15-30 is playable, but far from optimal. Getting one frame in five seconds during PvP is unacceptable, and getting similar frame rates at all is unacceptable.
---
Tesla’s are really bad everywhere, not just this event.
---
I looked up older speak and spells but the screen shape is really similar compared to this
---
Yeah, look through the ammo converter and see what things are worth in points. Any ammo that's worth 5 points or more, if you can get it for one cap each, is usually worth it. So 40mm, missiles, mini nukes, arrows, etc are totally worth 1 cap each. And most people sell them for that just to get rid of them.  I probably bought 800 arrows and 400 bolts yesterday.
---
I gotta assume that people aren't going to cater to you. Probably best to pack up and move elsewhere.
---
Ok well I most be confusing your statement above. I’m stacking the sneak perk which grants like 2.3x damage on sneak ranged shoots with a bloodied character to get massive damage buffs on ranged sneak attacks.
---
Oh.. Another entitled person who thinks that everyone else should change their gameplay for his needs. How about you just move your damned camp?
---
That’s a fair point
---
&gt; I don't even know why this isn't a thing yet,
---
Because Bethesda(tm). Something that should have been here day-1 became something incessantly requested, for everytime be met with Bethesda's everlasting silence on the subject.
---
[They *do* mention from time to time they *know* it's a desired feature]https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gsf0s6/text_chat_isnt_coming/), but they do everything to avoid touching the subject further than that nor implementing anything about it. Bethesda's arrogance and bad faith at its finest.
---
On the flipside, they're also looking into implementing official mod support so should this go further, the text chat mod would become officially supported. So either way we may *someday* get text chat.
---
Also, if you suffer from a handicap (being deaf or mute) you can probably fill a complaint with the FCC with the new disability regulations (CVAA).

---
You might have actually been better off running solo - apparently if any one person in the instance breaks into 'danger' from 'caution' it takes away the sneak attack damage multiplier for everyone regardless of whether or not they are still hidden :)
---
yea there was a point where I couldn't aim a friend pointed out that it could be from all the loot (dead wendigos) laying around that nobody picks up. after we moved away from the pile of dead it helped, still unbearable tho
---
oh no my 12 minutes are so precious, takes literally no effort to move the blast radius a centimeter.
---
Perhaps consider saving yourself (and others) the trouble and find another spot to make camp? I had to give up a spot I was in when I realized I was in a target zone to get the Collussus to spawn when it first came out, it hurts, but it's the reality.
---
No, I just hit it really really hard though &amp; then Ace told me that if he didn’t get a cut he would be cutting me ha ha
---
It would seem as soon as the boss dies and you get the prompt to leave the mine that if you die you will be automatically removed from the mine, it’s extremely annoying and in my opinion it should just auto loot the body for you.
---
Yup happened to me. Got the "Event Complete" notification like 2-3 minutes afterwards too. Got those rewards, but no looting.
---
Colossal problem drop
---
I hate Tesla rifles. They ruin PvP, and so do stealth boys and VATS.
---
It reminded me of that scene in predator where they are shooting at the trees
---
i'll give it a try after i have completed the Legendary Run I'll finish it this week as I'm on Lvl 95 and should finish by the weekend.
---
*Gonna tell y'all a secret I discovered last night, and hopefully this works every time...if there's a tent you can FT to when Earle dies that is placed directly outside the mine, FT to the tent. You'll live and stay in the event, just like Lode Barring*
---
Good god what a find! Nice one!
---
You do realize that making the group size 10 could still cause your problem to happen, right?
---
I agree with that - as far as I remember you can't see camp location on nuke map, only static locations. So expecting someone who nuke to check the map if any camp is nearby is naive. I think moving camp away to safer location is the wisest choice here.
---
Or buy the gun base plan then scarp them
---
But its nerfed... i have several TSE n left it in the stash collecting dust
---
Entitled? Bruh I was just asking. Seems to me like you’re the entitled one who doesn’t think they should consider other people. Lmao, I’ll just nuke your camp while you’re running the event, it gives me plenty of time.
---
As a person who drops nukes frequent.  I will drop it where I please.  If ur camp is in my area.  Oh well.
---
I'm in the 430s and have had several low levels (sub 40-50) in the Colossus event and I have helped them, they've helped me. I have made a few new friends because of it. So...win win! If you're a low level and wanna give it a whirl, jump on it! Not like this is a one time event...
---
Which legendary effect is the magic one though
---
Or they could just move their camp out far enough that it's a non-issue where the nuke at Monongah lands.
---
Either or.
---
IDK, but to go along with what ImmotalP74 says, I do know my Ghoul Slayers switchblade generally takes out a L42 glowing wendigo in 2-3 hits.
---
That's without power attack or food/aid buffs.
---
Yeah, this stuff usually happens when someone(s) are using legacy weapons, especially gat plasmas.
---
I feel puny af 🤣
---
Oh okay that’s interesting and good to know, I’ve only been playing for a couple of weeks now and I’ve never seemed to learn anything from scrapping built weapons, I might have to give it another go.
---
&gt; Gear: B2525 Fixer 
---
What does B2525 mean?
---
I believe that they did not realise the changes would nuke that build so thoroughly and will tinker about to ameliorate it somewhat (eventually, this is Bethesda we are talking about).
---
TS fucks up your accuracy pretty hard. plus keep in mind it doesnt actually doubles your damage. so i'd take AA over TS any day
---
It does create another instance for a new group, however at some stage the ability to join that group finishes before the boss dies even if it's not even half full.
---
as a camp builder fanatic, I feel your pain, OP. This is why I picked a spot away from everyone and everything. I don't want my creation trashed.
---
it's been said, you might have one uncompleted. You can try scrapping her station and remaking it. Or making another ally station and scrapping it and remaking hers.
---
Those are buggy sometimes but they seem to work well for me now
---
You can build weapons and scrap them to learn the plans. It works the best if you have high intelligence.
---
Thank you for clear numbers. Do you think SBQ doesn’t scale proportionally to the number of players though??
---
Once, and only once, did I see a super mutant gain a star after mutating.
---
You dont need a hazmat suit,PA, or stealth suit in the cave though. Its not a nukezone inside.
---
It seems like sometimes the event runs mostly Ok with only a little frame loss and lag and other times it just takes an absolute shit and runs at less than 1 fps.
---
I've heard others say that Teslas are to blame for the frame drop but I do not think this is the case.  I ran the event 5 times yesterday and every run that was mostly fun had people using teslas while the worst run that I had where it was a literal slideshow no one was using a Tesla.   I think it's just a total crapshoot whether or not it's going to behave itself or not.  
---
This game is just poorly optimized for consoles and it's unfortunatee
---
Try it replicating our build mate! :)
---
Never going to happen, even though I completely agree that it should. New players are the revenue stream for Bethesda. New players will spend a bit more in the atomic shop, where your general level 100+ player has mostly been used up from a monetization standpoint. Sure, maybe there's another $10 here or there from the likes of us over the course of a year, but we're hardly dependable.
---
Events like these are joinable like this by design. They allow low level characters to see the size and scope of the "late game", and it gives them something to work towards. It also shows them they need to level up _a lot_ to get there. It's a sort of carrot for the grind, in a way. They've erased basically every negative aspect of joining public events as a level 5 character. Die? Junk doesn't drop anymore. You also respawn quick enough to not matter (assuming you dodge the fast travel bug). You're bound to get tons of experience too. No risk, lots and lots of reward. This is by design.
---
The only reason I don’t want to move it is because it has some nice pre-existing structures, my favorite ones actually. Otherwise I’d move it instantly.
---
Maybe someone was using hacked weapon? ‘Magic’ weapon is fixed in PTS so this will less likely happen after next patch, especially when they blanket nerf all weapons. It’s gonna be long and hard for everyone.
---
That may have been why it didn’t work, it was more when I initially started playing so I had super low intelligence.
---
Hmm not sure which I would prefer I have a TS2590, a Stalkers25 with the penta for magic a few others I have rolled out but no AA.   
---
I would say go coax a SB to the ground and kill it do it twice see which one works better for you. Honestly though I would only use the gauss mini for mobs and not "bosses" the ammo return sucks when crafting them so unless you are swimming in flux (get the best ammo return) or sitting on 100k in lead and 300k in steal expect to have them both on the sidelines until they either fix 2mm ammo returns crafting or wait for the legendary perk which in the PTS stacks with ammosmith.
---
I didnt even know there was a chest
---
Bloodied 25% faster fire rate 25% reduced Vats Ap Cost
---
Especially if the the damn colossus is spawn camping
---
https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D9mRX-MEPzhs&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj-ns_sxLbrAhVls3EKHdfYD8MQwqsBMAJ6BAgMEAk&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ZQTXGQo3uAN8WRf9PJsVx
---
Sounds like a good theory. Ya that server must have been bugged or something!
---
I really enjoy camp building and this spot has great pre-existing structures that fit the scene very nicely. I would love to move my camp if I could take the prefabs with me.
---
When you go to escape the mine, right before the exit there is a room on the left that opens after Earle dies. There’s a chest in there
---
lol I've rolled almost 100 chests trying to get a chameleon/sentinel
---
Does he have a min damage for drops? Pretty sure he does, just assuming its the same as SBQ.
---
So you're the guys who one shot everything@every event.
---
So everyone has to nuke with the mine just on the edge because one guy has a camp there.
---
Time move.
---
I really want this on a harpoon gun
---
This isn't a MOBA lol
---
Sounds like you need to work on inventory management.
---
Yeah my group has been scoping the overall level of everyone on the server and messaging higher levels to gauge interest before launching nukes. I haven’t failed to kill Earle yet but I have had a couple low levels sneak in and stand around doing nothing x x
---
Interesting.
---
I did notice that I would get a sneak bonus on my first hit (about 90 dmg) but it would immediately drop to regular even if i was still in caution, till I went to caution from danger again.
---
Once patch 22 hits the regular game I'll have to try it on private and see if this works.
---
Nope just ran my 15th on xbox still no problem. Question did someone have a tesla rifle? I have not ran into anyone using one but I have heard that is the reason for the FPS lag, not sure if true or not that is why I am asking.
---
Really surprised at the reaction to this thread.  It makes more sense to only leave a tiny sliver of the mine in the blast radius so you don't leave the mine into a blast zone when it's done.  
---
If someone has there camp there you can't have the common courtesy and wherewithal to drop it so it triggers the event and doesn't destroy someone's camp?  
---
Some people do not just want to up and move camps because the location is special or unique and the build cannot exist anywhere else.
---
How tf is that such an issue. Same results with the same time spent... you guys are just extremely selfish.
---
Your assessment is mostly correct, though it would be more accurate to say TS is more effective against enemies with low DR and AA is more effective against enemies with high DR.
---
TS is worth a flat 25% damage increase. AA offers no damage increase, but more of the base damage gets through when your enemies have armor. 
---
The Awareness perk lets you see enemy DR and ER in VATS. Personally I would carry both shotguns, main the TS one, and switch to AA for the tough stuff.
---
Why even bother launching the nuke?
---
Not missing much.  Some stimpacks and ore basically.
---
Totally agree.. please explain why a level 35 who hasn’t  been to fucking Morgan town yet can join this!!good goin Bethesda
---
YES! 2 of them had Teslas! I guess I have to go test I again haha
---
Yup. Any extra gun killing the wendigo spawns is helpful and reviving players lets the heavy hitters focus on killing Earl.
---
No, those will be the guys with the hacked or magic weapons - we just tag stuff :)
---
I despise the Enclave, and was forced into joining them through railroad story writing just so I could finish the campaign.
---
If I could quit them but still participate in end game, I’d do it on a second. So would my husband.
---
Take em both out to whitesprings and play. When I get new guns i test them out on my lab ghouls at the golf club.
---
You gotta hotkey them.
---
Meat week meat week hmmmmm hmmmm hmmm hmmm! Who gonna eta da meat? Humans! Who not gonna eat da meat? Chally! 
---
-Grahm 
---
Meat Week 2020
---
That's how I did my first one. As I was loading into the game after the update, I saw the notification. Took a good minute for my map to open, and the marker was gone, but I could see public teams there. Joined one, and fast traveled to a teammate. Worked like a charm.
---
SBQ just needs to stop including anyone sub 40~ in HP scaling and provide lower rewards for anyone sub 50. Deincentivise leeching without completely locking out content. 
---
I can solo the SBQ without any ‘broken’ builds, no magic weapons, standard PA Heavy build with no bells or whistles. Shouldn’t be hit too hard by the upcoming nerf. 
---
If just a few lower levels show up and don’t contribute, it becomes prettymuch impossible. Even worse if they keep flinch-locking the land animation.
---
This post now guarantees that if there is a camp within the circle radius and the mine it will be nuked. Congrats!
---
You should be fine. Mostly people just don’t want the level 20-30s Popping up because the regular wendigo adds that spawn are level 75 so they’re not really gonna stand a chance - so kind of dead weight
---
I’m done playing is she gonna land game when playing on a public with brain dead players.  
---
I might nuke her in private but if I’m in a public ACP all day.
---
This was the original plan. We wanted to see how fast we could kill it Privately before Patch 22. We're gonna test it again post Patch 22 with the same conditions to see how much of an impact it has on our load out
---
No one on average level will missing out SQB nukes and Earl nukes. So even if you didn’t message them, they would join in.
---
Finally a selfless person. Ily.
---
Sometimes taking Mentats will help with most of them. The Radium Rifle is notorious for having mods that are difficult to learn for some arbitrary reason, in case that's the weapon you're talking about.
---
I'll always do Scorched Earth if someone launches it and people show up.
---
No interest whatsoever in A Colossal Problem.
---
The biggest thing in that chest is caps. Got 500 once but its mostly 50-100. It comes down to what you want. I find with the cursed weapons to be a decent way to farm extra scrip. As for the boss i love the fact that it feels like a unique boss and not just a direct copy and paste Drag-Scorchbeast with a shiton of hp.
---
But this forum says you need a million bullets and it's practically impossible without hacked weapons and yadda yadda!
---
two shot each bullet is doing 62% of your base damage.  Plus it wears your gun out twice as fast.  I concur TS is okay for low levels and AA is better for tougher enemies.  TSE be prepared to repair your gun all the time.
---
Ah you right but I don’t play PC so idk bro
---
Maybe people think you have it there deliberately to be nuked? Like camps at whitesprings, they know the price they have to pay for such a nice location.
---
the way he said he was protected at all times
---
yes but less likley to happen
---
SBQ is a snooze fest that is one dimensional and doesn't offer much of a challenge in terms of survival.
---
Ty! Can you bring me a macadamia nut cookie with some chocolate milk as a treat? Douchebag.
---
Reminds me if a certain Fasnacht encounter where some doofus killed all the bots right at the end of the event by spamming molotovs and me and a few people started attacking him but before we could kill him he logged off. Though that's basically surrendering so I hope the others got some satisfaction like I did.
---
Lots of people, bud.
---
O_o lookin stuff like that makes me sad. I mean - great job dude! But my pistol/explo/heavyWpn/vats/bloodied build i so tiny compare to that... What im doing wrong? Once again: awesome achivment! ;)
---
I’ve read the plans will drop after reading.   
---
I’ve gotten 3 so far that I havnt read.  I prob swap one to my melee build and sell the others.
---
Ok, thanks. I was confused because you said 
---
&gt;without using exploits, magic or hacked weapons
---
Bloodied would be a magic weapon?
---
Okay, so the rumor seems to hold some water then.  Some people are saying it is the legacy gat plasmas and flamers but the very first 3 runs me and 3 others ran those legacies without a problem and I always pull out the BE plasma when the wendigos become to much.
---
I been messaging just because so many are afk at the meat week event. Had a level 400 that was like “oh I didn’t even know it was available yet, sure I’ll join” so lol it helps
---
For me it is totally random - no difference if I'm online or offline during the reset.
---
10 second fights will become 40 second fights.
---
Oh noz!
---
Not true. Because people avoid camps at the golfing range when nuking the whitespring. I’ve seen it done like this almost every time. And I do the same out of courtesy.
---
Nothing at all! We each play the way we enjoy, we just went into this optimised with the perfect gear buffs and perks :)
---
Butchers bounty used to work on ticks but they changed it a long time ago. 
---
Also stomps is are pretty common to find in game.
---
I’d roll with the AA, personally. Better accuracy and better against enemies with high DR. Probably less ammo wasted.
---
Cause I wanna do the colossal problem?
---
No, unyielding definitely does boost you up to max sneak.
---
Bloodied is not a magic effect currently, and you cant get magic rifles :)
---
2 days ago there was a girl that was on my friend's list and she was accusing me of sending her a picture of my d!(# on facebook, and I couldn't tell her it wasn't me, turns out there's another person with almost the same username than me, only a number is different and she thought I was that person. It was funny but she started telling everyone around and now some people in the game think I'm a pervert lol
---
Back in the day I thought it was going to be super important for endgame so I hoarded it like crazy, only to find it was never used again lol
---
This makes me feel better. Have done the event twice and both times couldn't find the exit and one time I died before I could even find Earl's body so I've missed out on that.
---
Once they come out, we can let you know.
---
You can, annoyingly though, if you get a mutation you dont like I dont think there is a way to specifically get rid of that one mutation
---
Escape Artist &gt; Sneak card
---
Drop that card, it's redundant with Unyielding and high AGI
---
I agree with you completely however both are terrible, lol. The SBQ is certainly more of a challenge with the variety of damage but neither are actually difficult. There should be more to endgame bosses than just shooting it in the head. The only upside/downside is wendingos are a pain for ill  equipped or inexperienced players.
---
Hey I am not the whiny bitch here, if you place your camp in a area that gets nuked often that is a you problem and I will make sure to go out of the way to nuke camps more often now since I know there are people like you. I will sliver the mine just to make sure a camp or two get wiped out.
---
Don’t test anti armor out on ghouls they have no armor
---
&gt;Cursed mining helmet
---
unexpected tf2
---
It'll be fine
---
Oh THAT'S who that is! I was sitting there wondering, why does this guy sound familiar? Can't believe I missed that.
---
This event by far beats sbq
---
No, but they’ll be more adept using automatics. A trained sniper will pull off a 2,000 yard shot, the man trained with an assault rifle won’t, no matter what gun he has. And in 76, you can pretty much train yourself to be good at everything in a certain tree, like the perception and agility trees. You could eventually train yourself to be an expert in all weaponry, only you’re not swapping out perk packs to do it.
---
10 4 on the chest good to know. I keep dying from random wendigo swipes as I’m running up the tunnel, which is very annoying when you’re a bloodied build. I also am not a fan that it feels like I have to play in PA for the event.
---
I tried that to no avail
---
I know, I was looting so much screws lol
---
Mint
---
Lmao I wasn’t whining, just asking and suggesting. But the good news is, while you’re out doing the event I’ll just nuke your camp since I have plenty of time to do so, knowing there are assholes like you.
---
He is *way* more of a bullet sponge on the PTS so I doubt it.
---
No. You’re allowed to like one over the other.
---
People can do whatever the fck they want.
---
I learned the plan already, it was actually my first reward from the first cook out event I did. So I was blessed. 
---
But yesterday I got another plan for it. 
---
So in my case, yes you can learn the plan and still have a chance to get another one.
---
I hope they don't make everything bullet sponges. A DC or other huge creatures soaking up bullets is all good, but a humanoid shouldn't be able to take more that one shot to the head.
---
Also blood packs.  I set mine to revolutionary any time I need more blood packs to make stimpacks.   If you are not getting any blood packs, lock your collectron.  Other players may be coming by and taking them.
---
It depends of your luck - maybe it's me, but I got 3 stars legendaries from ACP much more often than from SBQ. Other than that I prefer SE event - you don't have to wait 5 minutes, you waste less ammo, you get repair kits and more fluxes. If you got all rewards (plans and cosmetics) from ACP, I also prefer SE.
---
Did I say they couldn’t? Hellen Keller.
---
SBQ is less intense and the sense of ‘endgame’ boss is badly cheapened by endless one star nocturnal tire irons. Earle on the other hand feels more like a real endgame boss due to better drops. Nothing useful to me yet but no one star bullshit.
---
You can both reach rank 6 settler rep and it yourselves.
---
Or just use the scrip machine trading exploit
---
The plushie is cool,  it growls!
---
It's pretty fun until it starts lagging really bad.
---
So drop Sneak but keep Escape Artist?
---
Yep, I ended up in ACP with 3 players level 70 or below. After 5 minutes realized it wasn’t going to happen and FT out lol
---
I have no idee how bad it's on consoles. I had 3 FPS at line in the sand the other day, can't imagine it gets a lot worse?
---
You seem to forget that Black Isle was already ruining the franchise with tactics and brotherhood of steel
---
Sure haha
---
What’s the scrip machine trading exploit? If you don’t mind me asking?
---
TS has horrible accuracy in hip fire - much better when scoped/aiming, but ok fro tagging in mobs, or taking out low level mobs.
---
IMHO, AA is more versatile.
---
Sneak perk does not add any damage. You seem to be confusing it with Covert Operative which adds sneak attack damage but does not help you sneak.
---
No, rifleman is one of the worst builds
---
Their name doesn’t say “glowing wendigo” so I don’t think it does. 
---
I had the perk equipped and then I took it out, and damage didn’t seem different at all. The amount of number damage displayed with one bullet was the same. Same with a punch. So I don’t think they count as glowing, they just look like it.
---
None of that games were developed by BIS
---
Sorry was meant to say commando
---
seems like a bit of a waste for something that’d only be fought once or twice per character
---
Which I'm guessing is part of bethesda's point on the damage nerf.  Due to the stacking mechanism's currently - they scale a bit out of control.
---
Go for it, my camp is cheap to repair. We need more chaos in the wastelands.
---
Dude if you're on xbox I'll make you a suit of x01 if you want
---
Literal waste of breathe.
---
place a powerarmor in the station and continue decorating on it, it works
---
also putting posters left and right of the station looks neat
---
It is ai annoying I waste all of my ammo and break all of my weapons on earl and get nothing earl doesnt even give me xp neither does the SBQ
---
Better than being a waste of flesh.
---
It may just be my build but I feel like I’m wasting more resources than I am getting out of it. I run a t65 protocoled power armor with a BE15 Gatling plasma (mainly for the scattered explosive spray damage from the 1000 wendigo that spawn). I’ve had one very high end weapon drops and the rest were 3* mehs. I’ll probably do more SE after I get the minors helmet which I think is the last thing I need outside of the wendigo head wall piece
---
Any camp item you bought with gold, can only be placed in your camp and workshop. You can’t build it in another player’s camp. 
---
Any weapon you bought with gold can’t be sold to the robot vendor. Can’t be traded with another player. Can’t be sold in your store. And if you decide to drop it on the floor it will instantly be destroyed the second it leaves your inventory. 
---
So if your dad wants his own gauss shotgun. He is going to have to grind and do it on his own.
---
Yeah i know what you mean. With the 8 player limit people really need a build to participate. Almost failed once because we had two low level players just getting one shot by everything. Ive tried it with 3 characters High health PA Shotgun, Low health PA Heavy gunner and a Uny stealth unarmed build. Honestly didn’t encounter that issue on the way out with the wendigos.
---
Boggles my mind people keep asking for this. We've known this was the way for months now.
---
I usually make my own, the only problem I've had with getting power armor plans is for the t60, only got the left leg, but I've got almost every other pa plan, other than the mods
---
I’m also bloodied but I have t had to run in pa for this event at all. The first time I ran the event I died a few times but once you know what to look for and what not to step in it gets much easier. The only thing I do is have a hazmat suit on the favorite wheel to quick switch before leaving the mine

---
here you go, now move along fun police.
---
This. In more detail, the best food is Deathclaw Wellington (3 STR) with Mutton Meat Pie or Mutant Hound Stew (+15% Melee) and Carnivore mutation will double those. For drugs, either Psychobuff or Fury and you can take an X-Cell first to stack but that only lasts a minute. Whiskey is the best booze with Party Boy/Girl. Nukashine will give you a little extra but will teleport you after. For bobbleheads you can use unarmed, melee or str. Some of the Grognak magazines will also help.
---
Can i stay and have my opinion?
---
How dare they do something different with a 20 years old franchise ?!?!?!! :'( :'( :(
---
They killed Fallout !!!! :(
---
Interplay did so many great Fallout Games, like the rushed Fallout 2, Fallout Tactics and Brotherhood of Steel !!! This was the Golden years of Fallout !!!
---
The number of players don't matter to them.
---
You can also hang them on Beckett’s bar
---
You want atoms for free?  Get that commie logic out of here!
---
In all seriousness, they really aren't going to.  The whole goal of seasons was to give enough that you think your getting more, and then to strip you of infinite free atoms. 
---
As it is now, there are finite atoms in the lifetime challenges, and the only infinite ones are limited to the seasons and purchased atoms.  They now control this more.  Just think, they switched out the earliest challenge rewards with disease cures, food, and water, and called it good for new players.  Cause it's not like the early quests dont shower you in the things anyway.  Just throw more in and call it helping.
---
The whole thing reeks of marketing department to me.  That said I dont purchase atoms, and have really only purchased a few PA skins with my earnings.  It sucks that we lost the dailies and weeklies for atoms, but it wasnt anything no one saw coming.
---
Honestly a Black Titanium .50 cal sounds BadAss and it could maybe do like +50% damage to cryptic class enemies Because why not?
---
I’ve gotten 3
---
That's a good idea and you'll need em!! Lol no joke I spent about 4 or 5k .50 rounds and about 1000 fuel on 1.. its gets expensive dude 
---
Side note: hiiiii lol
---
Exactly. I enjoy shooting games not crafting games. If they nerf all weapons I’ll just have fun elsewhere.
---
But they didn’t really create this game to be a one and done type thing, did they? It’s supposed to be generating income for them over time. Obviously that’s happening to some extent, but if they’re losing people over something as simple and as universal as an in game chat, that’s something that they should really look into.
---
Not for you to decide tho
---
Just did
---
That'd be fantastic waiting for the resilient scorchbeast on death's door to finally land so you can give it a love tap &amp; end the misery for the both of you.
---
Go back to sleep, Grandpa. 
---
Franchises need to evolve to stay relevant. It just turns out the Fortnite crowd is the dominant market to cater to. You can’t be upset at Bethesda for trying to follow basic business principles. I’ve played the Bulk of the Fallout games, and I am just fine with what FO76 is.
---
 By your logic, we should still have the same gameplay style, graphics, and mechanics from a game released in 1997? 
---
Sure, I wouldn’t consider Fallout 76 to be the dark, dystopian atmosphere we know the series for, but it wasn’t meant to be. It’s an offshoot and a crack at multiplayer... enjoy it for what it is. 
---
Really getting tired of seeing posts like this. Play Fallout 4 and mod it to your hearts delight to get your fix. 
---
EDIT: remember this wasn’t made by Beths A-Team either. Good chance the next main instalment (FO5) will follow the direction we’re used to.
---
First daily I ever did for Wasteland Wanderer gave me a Two Shot Ultracite Laser Pistol. Let's just say it's all been downhill from there...
---
Fallout 76 wasn't rushed? Was it better that the "rushed" fallout 2?
---
Give the Squirts empath serums. If they're gonna die in one hit, they might as well give you free damage reduction
---
unless they patched it out in the last 3 weeks or so since i played last there are ways to trade bullion stuff
---
I also found a random raider PA in my inventory.
---
Who is Boe? I already subscribe to all the answers you gave...I’m saying this to have another option at the end of the score system. Nothing more and thought since ideas here have been tried and tested that Bethesda would listen. Or at least let the score carry over to the next season.
---
Im still here
---
Forgrt the exit - so many screws to be looted in the main chamber 😀
---
Your already overqualified
---
Do you have fallout 1st? Because if I did id be able to use all 800lbs of my stash for weapons and armor,  not 70. because of fo1st I have to choose between keeping the gear that I like or not being able to pick up things as I go.
---
Guaranteed 3-star + Guaranteed 1-star + possible 3-star Cursed Weapon &gt; Guaranteed 1-star + possible legendary add that you may or may not be able to tag.
---
Also screws and ammo from wendigo spawns. Pretty much the only way the queen is better is that she gives repair kits and is a little easier to kill.
---
If you spent thousands of ammo on one run, you probably shouldn't be running this event. Get stronger
---
I'm down I might not get on today or tomorrow , though my PSN Is Guera922. I am a bloodied unarmed player Level 265 I can bring my buddies if you want their not that powerful though also I can solo the wendigo colossus as I did yesterday I'll add you.
---
Sounds fun!
---
I'm building up banked levels (think I'm closing in on 275+ perk packs) - when I get to the point where I can snag the ones I want / need I'll swap back to more DPS.
---
This is a 1st for me. Only sound issues I have had is where the game sound will just go mute. Best of luck finding the cause. Doubt this would do the trick, but maybe try another hdmi input on the tv or try a different hdmi cable.
---
tHiS IsN'T tHe GaMe I WAnTed sO MaKe iT LeSs CasUal! 
---
/s I was mocking the dude who got downvoted
---
It was owned by Interplay which Black Isle was a subsidiary of and the only game in the series developed by Black Isle was Fallout 2 since you want to get technical.
---
On the same token though, they created the mechanics. It's part of gameplay. The damage restructure at this point feels like a lazy attempt at "improving" the game.
---
Number one request for me
---
You can actually loot the wendigos to get more ammo back than you spent on killing them.
---
Ok, just did another one with only 2 others and it was fine to aim, they did have an explosive flamer, but that was fine - no Tesla’s
---
I still can’t figure out how people are dying so much
---
Haha I always run the health regen serum. I don't use chems much and I like that speedy recovery after a fight without needing to use meds or foods! lol
---
I played it last night with a group, we barely made a dent.  He is a huge bullet sponge.   Guess I am not the right build for this one, probably have to be a tank/heavy gunner.  We barely got him past the mutated stage.  I think I’ll wait this one out.
---
Beware!, maybe the gamers in this game are so friendly because there is no flaming? I for one am ok with that
---
Well he most probably got god rolls but just not for HIS build. That’s the case with most people.
---
Question for OP. 
---
I'm running a stealth rifleman build with damage output of 600+ per shot. Are you telling me that I'm going to doing the same damage if I only change to Commando.
---
100% depends on your own build.
---
I'm a stealthy rifleman. My weapons do barely anything to Earle; it would probably cost me upwards of 20,000 shots plus the hour it would take me to fire them all to solo him. If I switch to Commando (which I can and do) it takes less time, but still a completely not-worth-it amount of bullets (not to mention I only keep around 5k bullets on hand).
---
What I *can* do is run support by killing the Wendigo Spawns and stimming people. They rarely reach the real damage dealers when I'm around. But if you ask me to solo with 7 low levels (and I can't use my magic gun), I'm gonna have a bad time.
---
When I have nothing else to do, I'll pump some bullets into Earle, of course. But I can't really do anything to noticeably move his health bar.
---
I don't want to spend 10 perk points moving SPECIAL for heavy guns every time I want to run an Earle - that's unsustainable. I don't want to run Bloodied, and even if I did, Bloodied weapons are prohibitively expensive. There's got to be some give and take here.
---
I don't mind carrying one or two low-levels on a team of 8, but if it's just me and them it's not gonna go well. That said, I also have yet to see a single low level at the event, so I think people are just blowing smoke.
---
My favorite is when you die the second scortched earth ends and some asshole takes your flux before you can make it back.
---
Boe is a typo of now.  Fixed it in edit, but clearly you are too fast for me.
---
And they won't let rollover as that cuts into profit.  After all, they sell ranks.  And bethesda does not tend to listen on things like this.  They only listen and act when it suits their interests or are in need of more good will, and slashing their own potential profits does not benefit them.
---
They're so used to single player Bethesda games where mistakes only cost you time.
---
Pathetic.
---
Nope, actually it’s much more stable than SBQ for me.
---
From one old player to another:
---
Get over it.
---
They are the same as Xbox or PlayStation ones... little ignorant there considering you class yourself as an Achievement Hunter
---
Yes, except 5 times faster.
---
We will know in about 1 hour and twenty minutes.
---
Quick question when you solo is there any less enemies that spawn when solo?
---
Assuming you don’t get rando killed before looting Earle and making it out of the mine
---
Wow. This is what I'm spending my saved levels on then.
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
if you have 730 lbs of scrap in your stash that’s on you. 
---
Also there is no reason to store 800 lbs of weapons and armor. 
---
Your obsession with hoarding things doesn’t mean that the stash box is monetized
---
Npc scaling was a big fat hoax
---
Not that I’ve noticed it’s always just been the same amount just not as close together just walking around cause I’m always in sneak
---
Nope, he knows what's good and what's not. Mostly onesrars or the usual zealot, nocturnal, mutants or some other useless crap.
---
My player has a habit of scream running into fire or poison areas as a bloodied build lmao
---
Ok cool I’m going to solo it tonight then. I am also a bloodied commando
---
I have missed out on the loot from the colossus 3 times out of my three runs because of this
---
You'll find a good explanation on YouTube
---
Really? Glad i quit before Heavensward then... game was always too damn slow for my taste, same with XI, and their zones in XI sucked anyways. Cmon, you're telling me you have FF 1-10 to pull from and you make the uninspired zones found in FFXI? At least in XIV the zones i remember had an actual FF feel to them, and that game is still running last i heard, OH and they were working on a mobile port to that turd lol.
---
So you agree we should just have a perk called gunsman that covers pistols, semis and full autos?
---
I hope we got some (hopefuly working) weapon skins instead of broken prefab
---
nice blogpost, nobody cares about your inane ranting.
---
Ewwww communism
---
I think wasting air is worse, rotting flesh is good for the ecosystem. Other things need oxygen. I guess you just don’t have the mental capacity for anything huh.
---
You hit the nail on the head there - it is random.
---
Then reallocate a lot of special points and join the upper class
---
Ah, the power of multiplicative bonus stacking. I’ll be sad to see it go because of stuff like this, but it’s probably for the best.
---
Just use revenant and chems and you’ll be alright
---
And adrenaline
---
Or at least that’s what I’ve thought because I’ve taken tank killer on and off for several different weapons on ghouls and made no effect on damage numbers
---
I only finished the colossus on my alt account and then died from leftover effects from the fight and then spawned outside the mine
---
On my main only 2 others came and my gatling plasma did almost nothing I don't want a even bigger fight
---
This has nothing to do with your original comment to which i replied
---
Cool, there is still hope :)! That's why my build looks soo wierd, it based on my fo4 build and reminds me good old times :) have fun and good luck and bring us more clips and achivments like that! Cheers!
---
Depending on  their build and gear even a level 30 to 40 can be viable, what the game needs is a gear score or average dps output gauge related to the event. If you dont meet the criteria, you cannot join. I've got a level 38 character that has way more damage output than my first character did even during the early days of the game and he was well past level 50.

It just depends on the player and the players set up. My gf did the event with my group of gamer buds, last night on a level 40 and managed to survive better than anyone else in the match, and she was knee deep in enemies just like everyone else, and it was all due to her build, she runs a high survivability junkies build.
---
Personally I don't mind carrying a couple low levels, because it's a good way for these players to get levels and gear, and IMO that means they will become more useful in a fight sooner.
---
While convenient, I'd rather have the mutation work as intended and have Bethesda balance the mutation to be relevant in the game.
---
There are 22 diseases in the game if I counted correctly.
---
Unlock the cap and let the mutation scale all the way up to the full 22 diseases.
---
If we're doing 32 damage with 5 diseases that'd mean it's more or less going to average out to 150 damage a second with ALL the diseases in the game.
---
Considering how hefty a penalty those diseases put on your character, that's still not enough damage to warrant using it.
---
Wtf how you have so many legacies...lemme hold one.
---
You do apparently
---
My story is that I spend way more stims on other players then myself. Spent so much stimpacks that I have to reconsider reviving others, especially the low levels.  
---
I also have some bloodied friends that die every five seconds eating away my stimpacks.
---
So yeah, low level players that I already revived one or two times don't get revived beyond that. I am a warrior, not a f\*cking nurse.
---
Currently thinking of trying it without stims actually (vampire weapons).
---
Oh I just read your post again and realized the guy did nothing but the queen. Yeah that’s about right. The queen’s loot is a joke, one star garbage melee is all she has.
---
Oh look at the spud with a near witty comeback bravo, bravo.
---
I think the problem is that CAMPs don't show up on the nuke map.
---
100% I would always avoid your CAMP ... if I could see it as I'm aiming.
---
I just ran a solo and you can see camps when looking for a spot to nuke.
---
generally speaking it should be about 50% but all the chems and booze will also stack additively. so you'll probably see an even bigger drop.
---
Chem fiend is a good one, lifegiver as well in order to have as much health as possible along with field surgeon (?)(the charisma perk that make stimpacs act faster), but if you want to be sure, riflegaming on youtube did a video on his junkie sneaky commando build
---
Lmao, mocking an actual response is about as low as it gets. You must be running out of ideas.
---
I don't think there really are junkie specific perks that you NEED to equip. Just equip the cards that help you with survivability and carry weight because as a Vanguard Junkie you going to be over encumbered a lot if you dont run thru hiker, bear arms and batteries included.
---
It's better to do it that way anyways.
---
I'm not sure if you left to get ammo out of your stash or to craft more, but there is a tinker bench at the beginning of the mine to craft more ammo if you need to.
---
Yeah, thats really annoying too
---
You can. I just ran a silo to test and it shows everyone’s camp, so long as they have a vendor.
---
Use bloodied package ie Adrenal Reaction mutation, Nerd Rage, Bloody Mess, Adrenaline, Tenderizer, Glow Sight
---
I mean it should have been done at launch, i guess there was a mod for it but i mean... this ain't FO4. I don't trust mods and Bethesda with this game.   
---
Honestly with the last patch and the introduction to bugs i thought we left behind pre-wastelanders i'm kind done for a while. The feeder pellet dailies are an insult to my intellect, and once the questing content dried up it honestly feels just as vapid and hollow as it did before.   
---
I don't expect them to add a chat functionality any time soon... if ever. The game still runs like a hat full of wet assholes.
---
It's OK I got enough shovels and pick axes to last me a life time, Sombitches!
---
I preordered F76, played in all betas, i do understand that games need to evolve and i was fine with F76 up until they started to push ridiculous outfits and items and making a game a fortnite clone.
---
no I'm just letting you know you're a complete and utter dipshit
---
But ty for being considerate man.
---
Ah shit RIP lol
---
The Wendigo spawns are not tagged as Glowing, so Glow Sight will not proc. Datamined.
---
I admit that once in a blue moon you get the guy who has an optimised build, but take it from a 300 whos playerd since launch, the majority of people below 100-150 don't have any build that works for efficient kills
---
It has everything to do with your post to which I replied. Considering you said “games” you are wrong since they made a singular game.
---
Ahhh just found it after killing Earle right now.
---
I feel incredibly stupid but I figured it out. It was the encrypted broadcast on the radio. I’m not even sure how it got turned on honestly but THAT has got to be the absolute most annoying sound ever after about 3 loops... And I have a 2 year old lmao
---
Thank you
---
Wasted ammo, wasted stims, wasted everything only for a final runaway. Feels like Michael Bay movie. Totally worth it all the times I made this event.
---
I'd suggest you move. My last camp was up there near the tracks, with a nice view of Atlas across the valley, except it was outside the blast radius if the nukes were centered on the mine. I found that \*some\* people would deliberately shift it over just enough to make sure my camp got vaporized. There are considerate people out there, and some would avoid my camp even as they were trying to keep the mine on the edge so they wouldn't have to escape into a rad zone, but you can't stop everyone from being a jerk. That's life in the wasteland. Now you know why DC and New Vegas are still shitholes two hundred years from now.
---
PA has built in stagger reduction, believe it or not
---
Can’t relate. I’m a bloody build and this event is a blast. It’s what I’ve been wanting out of a “dungeon” type event and I wish they would take the time to redo the burrows to be something more like this
---
it's been confirmed several times in the past, I think turtle made a video on it as well.
---
if your target is in combat with anything else, mobs or players, your sneak multiplier won't trigger. you're still hidden/in caution of course, but you'll be dealing the same damage as if you were standing.
---
it's worse with the queen because sometimes she'll engage the mobs by the forest or the edges of the fissure. so even in private you'll have to clear out the bog first. with Earle it's simpler since there are no other mobs around.
---
50% of the time...can’t control it and I’m just watching my 20% health evaporate
---
I'd say they there is no point speculating on this. They're not gonna change an ongoing event and soon there will be no point to do so, since One Wastland gonna pretty much solve it.
---
Well they're creating the damage nerf, so by that rationale it's completely justified.
---
Team work makes the dream work
---
I took the drill on the left side of the room to the chin.
---
lol...entitled.  
---
If anyone was "entitled" I'd think it would be the people who show up to the event, contribute nothing and expect a reward.  
---
Having said that, I don't particularly care if some low levels show up.  It's never caused the event to fail for me before.  Just makes it more tedious.
---
one gun army
---
Lmao
---
Oh yeah my mistake thanks for pointing it out. Still BIS didnt develop Tactics and BOS
---
Lmao, yeah makes sense. The duality of man.
---
Naw unlike you, I have an actual business to run and I have wasted enough time on plebeians like yourself. Also if I have to explain why a waste of flesh is worse it takes the fun away from the special needs kid that thinks he is intelligent.
---
I've yet to even have 8 players show up.
---
Earles meat work cookout
---
Get the bag of rice.
---
I one shot anything with my BE Laser... Why should I go commando?
---
I hate using buffs and chems, aside from perk cards it takes to much work and doesn't last long, I've never used them in all my fallout experience (3,nv,4,76), except to increase my strength when I'm overweight and need to fast travel.
---
Anyone could run in front of you... not just low levels.
---
I didn't say it was or wasn't justified. I said it feels lazy.
---
It's needed, but but not how they are implementing it.
---
I'm a non power aromr, but for power armor I'd recommend considering, traveling pharmacy, rejuvenated, adamantium skeleton(double check that it works in PA), field surgeon, chem fiend,  and bloody mess
---
Ah yes because deaf people can totally use voice chat lol
---
Karma's a b**ch
---
I was joking hence the winky face...
---
Speaking personally (full health/heavy PA), I always try and let everyone get a shot, but using one gun army (I think that’s the one) lets me cripple too. I usually get some early shots and then watch for people going down/getting swarmed and try and support my teammates.
---
HAHAHAHA. A BUSINESS TO RUN. Bruh, if you had a business to run you wouldn’t be concerned about replies on a fucking reddit thread about a GAME. And if you’re running a business you must be old as fuck. Menopause must really suck if you need to find thrill in a game like this 🤭
---
You like saying that huh??
---
I'll have to give that a try then, cheers
---
Thanks for info
---
This is why multiplicative damage has to go.
---
Even better, I just got killed while the boss was alive, respawned properly but the boss died as I was jumping back down into the boss room. The second he died the entrance caved in on me and killed me, spawning me outside. I like this event, but there needs to be some reworks done in terms of spawn rules when the boss dies. Denying players loot in this way is just frustrating.
---
I got adrenaline maxed but rarely use chems. I know last fight yesterday I was trying to stay in power armor we almost lost that. So 6 minutes left I got out and we finished it. But I wanna solo it and see what happens I have 21 nuke cards might as well use them
---
Running around with a shotgun
---
Only had the one so far but I’m hoping the RNG gods are kind and I can earn another one lol
---
It's an instanced event that splits everyone up into groups of up to 8 players.
---
So it's not like the SBQ where literally everyone can join and it's a big group lagfest.
---
Not at all, these people who are able to have the perfect build like his are unable to do much but that, as a casual bloodied it will genuinely ruin the games combat for me
---
My base is by Monogah I've had to go through 6 nuked worlds in ten minutes all with colossal problem running.
---
Maybe it's a PS4 thing...
---
Ran into similar issue last night, got a message that said “you were removed from the instance” mind you the event hadn’t started yet, was just booted randomly outside. So I joined a public team and fast traveled on the team leader inside, seemed to fix the issue. Try rotating players out for ammo and things like that but have at least one person on a team anchor the event so you can get back in.
---
If you feel that strongly stop playing. 
---
I hate what happened with Assassin's Creed and stopped playing it.  Far healthier to cut it out than to harp on it.
---
&gt;remember this wasn’t made by Beths A-Team either. Good chance the next main instalment (FO5) will follow the direction we’re used to.
---
Not with this community i suppose, just look at this comment  section. Youll probably have Fortnite 77
---
That's so damn stupid.
---
lulz
---
This. Each time I’ve gone down now, 3-4 of us go down, while 2-3 are idling or dancing at the entrance.
---
not as much as I like the boys and I getting them out.
---
Yes, thank you!!
---
And Chally the moo-moo power armor helmet please!
---
Doesn't seem to cause problems on console.
---
Great to hear, I’m hoping to earn another if possible before the end of the event but we’ll just have to see if the rng swings in my favour one more time
---
Is there a problem lad?
---
Giving a thumbs up and down is not enough to tell someone that "I do have a Steam account but we can't talk on Steam because I am on Bethesda launcher. But maybe we can try Discord"
---
When I give my fellow gamers a thumbs down, they get sad and think I don't wanna play with them. And that's hurtful. :(
---
The ones they add today
---
No. Neither the resulting gear.
---
I just crashed out, i give up, i'll do it again in a month if its fixed
---
No that's not his point at all. Punishing people for dying in a Fallout game is stupid as fuck. Excuse me for not having the ultimate build and just wanting to play for fun
---
My pleasure.
---
Sweet! Glad to hear this. Problems arise due to the now-back steal from vendor glitch, though.
---
&gt; The damage restructure at this point feels like a lazy attempt at "improving" the game.
---
It depends what comes next.
---
If they make no other iterative changes - then agree, it was lazy, and really just a nerf.
---
If they use it as the new base to make additional changes / balances / future weapons - it makes a lot of sense.
---
As a casual bloodied, most mobs will still die in one or two hits, right? It's only the big stuff that will take more than 1 hit too kill?
---
They really need to buff our build.
---
It’s funny I’ve gotten every plan outfit multiple times. But I still haven’t gotten the cow outfit. It’s fine I’m not worried, my friend said she had a spare one for me since I have a spare cow head. But I just thought it was funny how I was lucky enough to get two tenderizer plans, and not a single cow outfit so far.
---
I can understand that if you sided with foundation that they would keep the status quo and let the secret service live 
---
What I don't get is why the raiders would? Raiders take what they want most of the time by force. Why didn't we just kill the secret service and take the whole god damned lot of gold not just the piddly portion they let us have
---
This 100%. Had the same thing happen last night, after dying right after killing Earl the game teleported me all the way to that town to the southwest, ammo spent and no rewards. Guess it ain't all bad, at least I didn't launch the nuke.
---
Yet another scenario that Goes to show that Bethesda has their heads so far up their own asses. t they’ve been working on this “collosal problem” for how many months now? Lolol
---
I still think that we can have a voice and opinions and this opinions of ours can reach devs sometimes? I do believe with some kind of a massive backlash against something in game we can have a positive reaction from the devs. I just realized that this subreddit community has nothing to do with Fallout at all apparently.
---
How should they implement it? I haven't been reading up on it much. I'm aware of the mechanics but not any alternatives.
---
God no.  Not if the 'only killable by melee weapons' is a thing.
---
Agreed. Although my concern is all the other bugs still in game not being addressed. And they start fiddling with damage of all things. Priorities.
---
Server stability seems to have taken a hit with the latest hotfix.  I'm sure it doesn't help having meat week going as well.  Textures and camps are taking longer to render and piecemeal themselves in since the hotfix.  Frame rate drops are more common as well.
---
The xbox version of this game has been poorly optimized since launch but since the hotfix it has sunk to new depths.
---
Yeah! First two times, then never again because I learned to stay out of danger.
---
Big amount of players will leave new players will find it to "hard" to play as they will need to spend shit ton of ammo to get nothing in return. People will stop doing end game activities and game will slowly die
---
And mysterious savior
---
LMAO that is actually hilarious that this was the issue.  I'm glad you got it figured out at least.
---
I like both. But I fought earl 3 times. First two times killed him looted him for crap. First was 1 star sledge and then a 2 star combat assassins. Died right after looting him. Spawn outside, get rug and meat pile but the 3 star was one hunters double barrel and bolstering scout armor. Last time I died right before he did and when I came back he died couldn’t go back down to loot body. First time I got to get chest. Only junk and caps. I exited mine and got stuck in black loading screen. Let the screen sit for ten minutes closed game out on Xbox and got back on. Somehow I still got all the rewards. Which was cursed harpoon and a furious 40% +1 agility sledgehammer plus all the flux and stuff. It’s fun because it’s new. But the timer does suck.
---
Eh, I'm level 359 and I still prefer colossal problem. Maybe it's just the novelty for now, but I don't play much anymore and 8 treasury notes is definitely a bonus. I don't care much for flux or caps, but both of those are fine too. If nothing else, it's at least interesting; there is a challenge, a bit of a gimmicky mechanic, and endless swarms of high level enemies. The SBQ is boring at this point, with half the server showing up it's pretty much guaranteed that some asshat with a hacked or bugged weapon will kill her within 20 seconds of landing. In 2018 people used to take pride in just being able to finish the event before the timer ran out, now it's a matter of whether or not you can deal enough damage to get the loot before somebody instakills her. Anything at all is a breath of fresh air compared to that
---
Calibrated shocks. Lol.  Forgot all about those.  That’s how long it’s been.  And yea.  Still don’t have them.
---
Fuck the 48 second wait timer I got to by getting wen-dicked so many times.
---
Yeah I had a camp near vault 76 at one point and put some ammo, drinks, healing items, etc. up for 0 caps with a sign saying "take if need - be reasonable" and I watched some level 300+ just take everything in there. I really doubt he needed purified water, salves, and .38 ammo.
---
Who gives a fuck what console users think? And why should that impede Bethesda from add a text chat?
---
Sad we think how long this took and how little this event adds was "worth the wait"
---
Because your weapon sucks against SBQ and and Earle. Not to mention that a commando does 5 times better what you do currently.
---
They don't fix broken bosses.  If we complain enough, they'll remove it with nothing to replace it and no intention of ever bringing it back.
---
So the only thing that defines a Fortnite clone to you are the outfits? What else has Fallout 76 in common with Fortnite? Right, as good as nothing. There's Nuclear Winter, of course, which is a battle royale mode, but go ahead and wear those bright colored outfits in that mode and try to survive...
---
They're nerfing everything the same across the board.Damage in pts is currently 52% less than in current servers.
---
What they should do is nerf Junkies and Bloodied a little bit and buff everything else.
---
Pistols are pretty bad even with a good build and will become useless.  Rifleman is far less superior than commando and will become useless.
---
Something like Nocturnal should slowly increase and then decrease your weapon to do 100% more damage, but with the nerf it will be more useless than it already was. Berserker should be at least 100% increase in damage, but it's currently 50% and would be pointless to use with the high risk of no DR and ER.
---
I got a 3* Junkie's explosive shotgun yesterday.
---
For what it’s worth...I saw a 27 second colossal problem run. Two or three people had a magic weapon in this twitch video lol
---
Just a smidge of Pre-meat-workout, a small boof.
---
That is quite strange but I’ve seen a few comments on random posts saying that someone can get everything but the grill, or everything except the Tate salad recipe etc so there’s definitely something funny going on lol
---
Good to know it’s not just me then. Most of that, I can / am already dealing with anyway. But the constant disconnecting literally makes the game unplayable. Which is sad, because it is a good game, just poorly optimised as you said.
---
What solution is that? This isn't an MMORPG btw, iv'e never seen a massive amount of anyone... anywhere... maybe 2 dozen people? That's hardly massive but  for the sake of brevity i guess we can call it that eh?   
---
So what's cute about OP's statement? That you basically agreed with one line down. What options are you referring to? Don't tell someone when, and when not to complain about something they bought, k chief? I don't think "we" forgot anything. I think it's VERY well known what engine this is...
---
Nope, casual bloodied it still takes like 8 from a B2525 handmade to kill a should sometimes. Also, bloodied builds are the main reason why queens are able to be killed within the time limit
---
Or if you die right after fighting the queen and lose all your flux.
---
&gt;Dying has consequences. 
---
Ah yes nothing like having to wait a full minute to hopefully play the event on the game *you paid for* is such a "consequence"
---
They included always on mics but no text chat lol
---
Cause then we have no bullion farming silly.
---
On a separate but similar note, a group of friends launched the nuke as a 4 man team and invited me to join solo to play with them on the instance. I joined, and found myself to be a 5th for a different team, which were pissed off at me because I prevented their other 4 man group of friends from joining their instance. 
---
Of course I had nothing to do with the issue, I was honestly trying to join my group of friends... They griefed me, refused to pick me up when I got killed, and were in general really not fun to play with. I ignored their harassment, dealt more damage then they did, cleaned up the Wendys and got insta-killed the moment the boss died and was ejected outside...
---
Lots of things wrong with this picture. Bad players, bad matchmaking, bad insta-death spots, and bad loot.
---
Don't put it in your vendors then?
---
I mean - isn't this post proof that they need to, though?
---
No new content = bored players;  more so then bugs.  Unless the game is unplayable by bugs - and by and large (for a lot of people) it isn't.  Are the bugs frustrating?  Of course.  But we still play.
---
Yet - they release new content;  and here is someone showing it dead in 12 seconds.
---
Similarly - although I'm new to fallout 76 - I've found the colossal problem extremely under whelming.
---
I've done it half a dozen times - with a random group.  And every time he's melted in under 3 or 4 minutes.  There is no challenge.
---
I agree with you completely!
---
I love this game a lot and i was really sad when i saw that there was not chat ingame...for variuos reasons i can't use headphones so i'm forced to use program like discord or teamspeak with speakers and since i play in weird hours sometime that can be a problem, if you add that i'm not so good in english speaking that's a big problem. I'm playing almost from start and with one exception of a friend that played with me for...a week lol, i'm always alone spamming emote and jump to make people understand lol
---
I even got the year 1st pass and play almost alone in my private server lol
---
I'm giving up hope for a text chat :(
---
Another required thing Is to have a minimum level to partecipate. Yesterday i got with a level 47, level 23, level 21 and level 67 (which Is ok)
---
yeah, I don't think bethesda is *generally* as bad as other companies, but from the Quakecon interviews it seemed like they were really laying it on heavy for this to be a September patch.
---
I'm not 100% sure on this but it seems like damage re-balancing/one wasteland, daily ops &amp; seasons are all tied together and wouldn't work without each other all coming online at the same time. If Daily Ops are SCORE awards &amp; need 1W to be doable for all player levels there could be some serious problems, especially as I'm sure the Bean Counters demand that the season comes out on time so that people buy levels
---
that's why she's space waifu
---
Me llamo T-Bone
---
La araña discoteca
---
Havnt been effected by that problem YET, but I am expecting it to happen one time.
---
What gripe I have with it so far is which genius thought it was a good idea to have the cool down period after dying be a whole bloody minute, it feels like forever waiting yo get right back into the action
---
So I was doing the event yesterday, was in the waiting area with everyone else, then noticed the exit tunnel was open for me, so went down the tunnel, other players apparently had rocks blocking same tunnel, had earl mutated by the time the other players were let in, so we killed earl and I went to leave, out of the exit tunnel, apparently it was still closed for everyone else with rocks, then I was prompted to drop down the mine again, no one else besides me could get out of the mine, then the event failed even though earl was already dead
---
Yeah, the fight is way harder than I expected. Then again, there was only 3 of us. And I'm a bloody melee build so he kills me in one shot. 
---
ALTHOUGH I did find out that if I keep jumping and attacking, I still do damage and it's really hard for him to hit me. I got a lot of damage in when I figured this out but it was a little late as there was only 2 minutes left. 
---
But yeah, I didn't realize the exclamation mark didn't stay up. I was wondering why no one was joining the fight.
---
I haven’t seen any info on it but does he also scale in difficulty the more people are in the instance or no?
---
Well they also are behind on standard pc features like widescreen support and FPS not being tied to physics
---
I think the nerf is only gonna serve as an extra challenge to find new and creative ways to fuck up boss enemies in 3 seconds
---
Group up before joining event. You can fast travel to the group members inside if you get put outside. To get rewards off boss you have to be there for the kill and actually loot his body. To get rewards for event completion you have to be outside of the mine and wait there until the timer ends. If you leave area before you get nothing.
---
Look for the ones with the big exclamation point in the middle. I've noticed it seems to happen when events already have people. That means things like Meat Week, Fasnacht, Line In the Sand or anyting else popular, are almost always free.
---
Yeah you can still cheese it in under 20 seconds with bloodied stealth commando. But at least that's not guaranteed to happen when you can have only 8 people there
---
I agree with you, an awesome if not the best questline in game, i was very sad when finished and there was nothing more :(
---
Maybe a survivor camp companion that give you secret quest :D
---
Ahh yes classic bethesda
---
I know that, it just doesn't make sense from a raider point of view to do that tho.
---
They'd kill and take the whole lot lol
---
And i guess you did...
---
Listen Bethesda can already do this on their own ( like they did when some hackers started to empty some players stash and inventory ). And a system restore isn't working like you seem to think it works. Again...i never heard of mmos or a multiplayer games that could do this without involving any human action in the process. When you crash, you crash my man. It's a crash, it's a game disconection, it's server disconection, it's not a big ass explosion that the server can detect miles aways.
---
Voice your opinion but don't always assume that the majority of the fanbase will always agree with you simply because that you are a longtime Fallout player.
---
Almost every Fallout game since 3 has generated a different Fallout playerbase and doesn't give you the right to determine what crowd is Fallout or not.
---
This may surprise you but there are people who became Fallout fans because of 76.
---
&gt; Low levels really need to have some sort of starter boss event, like a colossus type event for level 25 players 
---
No, they don't.  And let's not waste more time adding more low level content.
---
I had a *blast* playing the game 1-40.  Granted, it's a solo player game.  But it is a ton of fun.  Let them enjoy the content, and worry about the events once the content runs out.
---
It'll be ok pumpskins.
---
But I have 200 years of retail experience with Vault Tec! You can’t turn me away like this!
---
Yup same.  Using a furious handmade in stealth, I can ping him for 24 dmg max.  I tried a Final Word .50 and it did less damage (not a heavy gunner build) and made me a neon sign to all the wendigo spawns, so not a great idea on my part.
---
Yep, he opens my door to the main giftshop, the bar, the nuka cola machine door leading into my diner... and the fireplace door in the giftshop upstairs leading into my bedroom. I come home to 3-4 open doors every couple hours lol. All these simple devs need to do, is add a door shutting mechanic after some seconds, apply it like a lock, and done. Very basic fix, for a very vocal problem that has been bitched about for literal months on end lol, and this was BEFORE they added NPC's to augment the issue.
---
Well that’s not good
---
Best description of Earl I’ve read so far lmao 😂😂😂
---
"On the same token though, they created the mechanics."
---
You've used the baseline, 'they created' for justifying the damage being ridiculous.  "It's part of gameplay."
---
Ergo, I'm using the baseline 'they created' for justifying the damage nerf.
---
You're not being critical of damage but you're being critical of the damage nerf.
---
Why the disparity?
---
Gotta join a team who’s participating unless your event instanced filled up. Then you can load up on their circle icon
---
Right on. Thanks.
---
Right now, there's really no reason to use anything other than bloodied, junkie's, vampire's, quad, or instigating. The rest are just inferior boosts or useless gimmicks. If you want something similar to the voice of set, you could maybe go for a quad western revolver and just mess around with that. But I guess it would depend on specifically which weapons you intend to use
---
I have been playing since Beta, and the latest changes have made the game as bad as it was in the beginning
---
I was SO aggravated lmao I was seriously playing with no sound yesterday cause I couldn’t take it anymore. I don’t guess I’ve ever paid attention to the encrypted broadcast. I’m sure anyone else would’ve known exactly what it was and just turned it off. I’m honestly still confused as to how it even got turned on.
---
Its better for loot definitely.  After you get the plans from colossal only reason to go back is the screws. At least queen has a big pool of items she drops.
---
The second time I did it, 5 people were sub level 40.
---
People want to do events way out of their level and then whimper when they get shredded. Must be human nature
---
If i want to store enough materials to not have to go farming every few days, i have to limit the amount of weapons I have to make space for junk.
---
If i want to put the decent rolls i find from enemies in my stash to be sold using a vendor, I have to limit my junk so that I can only carry a small amount of materials.
---
If i want to hold enough materials to be able to contribute to the bos event, I have to have fo1st so that I can store thousands of junk items in advance.
---
The alternative is having to spend many perk cards on managing my weight (bear arms, bandolier, batteries included, traveling pharmacy etc) to keep a reserve of items all while a fo1st subscriber  gets to utilize all of their perks for their build, pick up whatever they want, store all the ammo, stims and flux theyll ever need. and not have to spend a minute managing their inventory.
---
*Easy targets lol*
---
I’m not one of those guys who will follow you around relentlessly trying to make you shoot back, but if I see you’re above level 50 and you have a workshop, I will take it if I want PvP. Ball’s in your court if you want to respond.
---
Two shot might be interesting, but the drop in accuracy might be too much for a gauss minigun. Since the weapon has built-in explosions, two shot doubles the explosions which quite significantly boosts the overall damage. But that doesn't mean much if you can't hit your targets. I'd say to just test them in a few scenarios and see which are better. If you can hit things with two shot, that is 100% the better option
---
No way, the raider punk is... "ROUND THE ROUND THE ROUNDANROUND" "HOW NOW BROWN COW REEEEEEEEE" and about 2 or 3 more lines that make me feel like some OCD 12 year old is in the room high on sugar.
---
Yea. Be nice if there consequences for ur choices.   I ran 5 toons through the mission and different choices assuming there would be consequences.  There wasnt.
---
I ran the new event 3 times yesterday with friends. We weren't worried about killing it asap. We ran around. Took pics. Farmed screws. It's about how you play more than anything. Will dealing less damage make it more fun? Who knows right now
---
Example?
---
Is there an optimal DR to Berserkers? I'm not going to wear any armour to speak of, just the Garb of Mysteries.
---
Scorched Earth feels too easy and monotonous. Rewards are better for the effort invested though
---
Because this woe is me PC complaint rings as faintly full of themselves.
---
Nope. None I found at least, super annoying. What platform are you on? I may have some ones, or can modify your PA with whatever ones I may know.
---
1* bloodied weapons are cheap idk what you are talking about
---
Introducing 4 stars!
---
I always swap between the two, mainly using first person to have better accuracy when I'm going to focus on just shooting but often use third for mobility. My only gripe with third person is how often my heavy guns just shoot the floor.
---
No means once you joined that que you saw was already full and you joined a new instance.
---
The level 400 guys at a workshop in their Excavator power armor are lovely little presents if they want to fight back, they usually have good loot on them.
---
The my bloods in it cola storyline wouldn't hold up then.
---
Not earle tho I tried stealth tank explosive harpoon with mutants 1s with armor pen and all sorts of revnant tenderized endangeral bloody mess and I was hoping to  vats his face and one-shot him sadly mistaken
---
Star Wars: The Old Republic.
---
the fence do snap together. snap on various angles. you can build a square or even a hexagon. it’s a nice feature. 
---
the bunker has a problem right now as everything floats when placed on the floor. it’s seems that it’s missing the floor, so everything floats.
---
I cant say if it can be destroyed but I’m assuming it can. do we have any prefab that cannot be desteoyed? if so, I’m unaware. 
---
hope I helped.
---
Stash... had nothing on me to craft.
---
Yes even a psycho buff
---
I also love vendor hopping. You never know!
---
Si
---
I thought you can't get the sneak bonus dmg if there are players that have been spotted/aggroed by the enemy. Same if there are two enemy factions fighting each other, you don't get sneak dmg..am I wrong?
---
you will still timeout spinning the spit if you do not interact with the game.
---
This sub is full of people like us. One of the best gaming subs out there indeed.
---
Just like Factorio, where everyone is wasting their lives away making the factory grow.
---
Very fun, total chaos. I spent the whole time shooting with the bloody gauss minigun, pretty much only stopping to reload. If I wasn't shooting Earl, I was shooting wendigos or dodging falling debris. It was chaotic combat. I felt like that guy from Predator, it made me want to let out a warcry the whole time I was holding down the trigger.
---
[https://youtu.be/dK1B9b\_0Z2Y?t=72](https://youtu.be/dK1B9b_0Z2Y?t=72)
---
How so
---
Lol they didn't add any form of level scaling or matching? Why am i not surprised by this? You simply don't let people in below a certain threshold be it level or gear score... how hard is this Bethez?
---
Yep, it’s a shitshow lately.
---
I'd say AA for gun accuracy and durability but TS makes pretty powerful guns occasionally. Maybe try them both and see how you feel
---
Where did you find it? There used to be an exploit that allowed you effectively craft and clone them at low levels, so people might still be selling off their hoards. Any above level 5 is rare though. As others said, yellow, pink, and indigo
---
Ok. I do understand  that even the shittiest games can have some fan base. Can we agree that its a fact that Fallout 1-2 are legendary iconic games? And all im saying is that maybe devs could look at it more than they look at Fortnite?
---
If you pay for something your entitled to it.
---
even idling isn't the end of the world.  with fascnat the spawns scaled to the number of players, so it made it harder to have idle players, with meat week, it doesn't negatively affect the chance of successful completion.
---
IIRC isn't that because you were in the vault, so not exposed to all the crap...
---
Yeah, I agree. But they are usually harmless and if you get to know most of them, you'll regret being a little cunt to them when they just want to play the game and not worry about other people (if I can even call them that) shitting on their day just for the reason that they can't be good at COD (people who prey on the weak food build or casual gamer I mean)
---
From a classic RPG standpoint the Vault is a ideal starting point as the character is a "blank slate", there's a reason F1/NV devs at Obsidian still used a similar concept with the colony ship full of cryo frozen colonists-It Just Works.
---
That wouldn't work. The optimal DR for berserker's is 0. The only way to make it even remotely work is using legendary armor and letting it break so it gives no DR but still gives you bonuses. But at that point, you're far more flimsy than a bloodied build and getting a weaker bonus for it, so you may as well just be using bloodied. Berserker's in this game is essentially what bloodied should have been
---
You can also hang them on the hands of the mounted Wendigo
---
I remember the first time I saw a colossus. I was like: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb6w5DUcz9I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb6w5DUcz9I)
---
It's a great questline.
---
I still wear the Veil of Secrets.  Gotta have that mask on these days!  =)
---
It sure doesn't seem so.
---
You can't customize this one tho, you need to do the tadpol quest to get this good one
---
Don't use teslas until they fix whatever this lag issue is, they seem to cause it. I never experienced crazy frame rate drops until my friend whipped out his tesla for Radiation Rumble.
---
Nice work! 
---
We did it in 3 mins 30 secs using bloodied melee and a few basic food and chem buffs but we are giving it another crack tomorrow with more advanced recipes, mags and Bobbleheads.
---
🤪🤪🤪three ppl took us 5 min a button of supplies to fix guns and all my ammo did it 20 times or so but I'm done with earle already all cursed all plans and my hat back to meatweek I guess
---
Can't help you, sorry. I play legitimately.
---
He has same health with 1 or 8 players, the SBQ doesn't scale either, that's a myth.
---
How will One Wasteland affect this in the near future? Will lower level players be able to keep up with damage since they will scale up?
---
Except you’re not a vault dweller in NV and it isn’t missed or relevant at all. In fact the only reason they even bothered was to throw you a pipboy which imo they did very poorly
---
You can get the base plans for free once you finish the brother hood quest line. But all the mods are only available from the Queen
---
What do you mean a cap? Do you mean a level minimum?
---
Thanks for the help
---
I did it today and there was someon level 6😂😂😂
---
😂
---
no, you dont die, but you do ALMOST die.  my hp stops dropping once i get to 11.   you will have zero AP pretty quickly though.
---
I think they both have their goods and bads. Especially with ammo drops for CP being linked to what you put out. Considering that fucker is twice the sponge the queen is.
---
I like your additional characters to get to 17 lol
---
And why a post-nuclear war wasteland? I don't understand why that's necessary.
---
They literally sign up for PvP when they take over a workshop, and I play fair. I don’t whip out a Tesla rifle, throw on a stealth boy and insta kill them from behind. That’s no fun. They have the chance to shoot me or run. They choose to shoot me because they’re 8 times my level, that’s on them. Game on. I don’t even have a Tesla rifle right now. Don’t like using them.
---
Xbox and I would be willing to trade for some plans if you have them...I am cap poor at the moment since I got my wife into the game and I have been twinking her a lot lol...
---
It wouldn’t be that hard to imagine a alternative storyline. Hell use the overseers blood
---
It can be tough, due to some folks having camps so close, yesterday we launched all three on a server and as the nuke was on the way, someone loaded in, and there camp was right next to the mine, dude sent us message saying we’re toxic players, his camp wasn’t there when we hit launch,
---
I tried both a few weeks ago, and AA tore up tough mobs way better than TS. Give them both a try for sure, but for me it was a significant difference.
---
Right now you can make teams like for luck or events or building
---
Hi mate that is correct :)
---
Not to mention that people who have spent 25 years preparing abandon their vault entirely and all go on their separate ways. There is like this Lone Wanderer / Sole Survival vibe when there shouldn't be at all. I guess this is why no one ever accused Bethesda of having deep, intriguing story lines.
---
What lol of course there it’s the entire world building but you being a vault dweller has hardly any relevance to this game.
---
Because it's not really creating new mechanics. Just altering what's been there since day one. Like they're surprised people now how to play for high damage. At the end of the day it's just my opinion that it feels lazy. Nothing more.
---
Great! Look forward to hearing how you get on, rooting for ya!
---
Nice. The closest thing I got to a God roll from an ally daily was a F2515...missile launcher.
---
But are they unyielding/bloodied?
---
Have you tried setting up some of the traps around them? Could draw them in with the scarecrows and then trigger traps to kill them.
---
Nice still trying lol
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f335e88&amp;d=s01sq2s22sx0s32sr2pe2eh2cu0ic4s12ip2id2s72a04l71ls2lt2c62ce0&amp;m=1c2fe3&amp;ad=03458
---
That's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights. Been running this build for 200 odd levels now and love it
---
That's another discussion, you said it doesn't effect the narrative, but it does, now you say just change it then :-)
---
I've been hiding under the shaft the whole time to avoid fear sending me into a pit. With bloodied commando, no checks/magazines/bobbles, I can get ~40 from a distance and ~200 up close with a head hit while in stealth. 
---
Being bloodied, though, nothing is worse than when he sends me into a fire/acid thing and it kills me while I'm in fear. Both times I did it yesterday I ended up dying 4-5 times.
---
The harpoon gun or the armor pieces ?
---
Wait, this is out for consoles now?
---
I fastest done it on my heavy gunner solo in 2minutes 20secons and feel so proud of my self !Nice job my friend you did😊
---
A YouTuber called this out in regards to the pvp in this game at release and how nonsensical it was narratively.
---
Hahah, don’t worry man, no charges from me. I’ll be on this weekend, I’ll DM you my gamer tag and we’ll get you sorted!
---
Actually I like to see someone get hits on it OTHER than one or 2 ppl killing it quick
---
Why would I follow the overseer? I would think I would be either a raider or a settler if I wasn't a vault dweller. Either of those didn't sound that interested in dealing with vault dwellers. Made them go kill a ton of scorched just to prove they are telling the truth about scorch spread.
---
Removing legacy weapons would be stupid as fuck.
---
Went in with a high level team of buddies and it was a piece of cake.  Went in later with some random guys, mostly lower level, and it took forever.
---
Fine you’re right only Sith deal with absolutes.
---
It would be a nice touch if the bunker couldn't be destroyed.
---
Thanks! I'll pass your support along to the boys. 
---
Earl himself is fairly easy to kill with the right gear but those damn Wendigo spawns are nuts.
---
Prepared to be inundated with downvotes from a horde of alleged ammo-scrap vendors who have dreamed of nothing else but running a junk store since Oct. 23, 2018  
---
Or something. Giving you an upvote because sunlight is the best disinfectant
---
I thought the mechanic was that if a player crafts a legendary, it can't be placed in a vendor, but if you get one of those weapons or armor as a reward drop (or from Murmg) you can.
---
So unless all 8 people in the instance sneak very effectively, we can't replicate that. Even one guy in PA can breaks everyone's stealth bonus. Shame
---
Because you’ve never met a vault dweller and the overseer convinces you. Bethesda writing isn’t that deep lol
---
Excuse me while I crush your windpipe from a great distance away.......
---
People don’t really see anything beyond the surface, unfortunately.
---
We're on Xbox too. I wonder if it's just a console issue or if this was something that happened for PC users too. I can't imagine them releasing the event already if this was a known issue. It was pretty infuriating. We only had about 5 people in the mine and were struggling a bit, but we had 5 minutes to go and a good chance at completing it until he just faded into the ceiling.
---
Coming from Destiny 2, what they did rather than nerf damage across the board (like, really?) was limit the amount of interactions between buffs and debuffs. Rather than making everybody weaker, why not just control the amount of min/maxing you can do?
---
We did it in a private server just to avoid interruption (and to make sure we werent being rude to people who may wanted to join in by killing earl so quickly) :)
---
The hard way..payed 2000+ hours since beta..
---
Came out yesterday
---
Without sounding like an asshole, a game that emphasizes grouping up for events and having bonuses apply to teams of players shouldn't have to outright state that something is more optimized for team play. It's kind of implied by the modifiers themselves. I'm sure the idea here is to encourage coordination between people: "I'll focus fire and spray them down to around quarter health and you clean them up with melee hits while tanking." Saying the daily ops are playable solo is still 100% true...but it's absolutely fair that it's more difficult for one person vs. four.
---
Thank you for the confirmation tho. I assume it applies to melee as well right?  I had a guy claiming he can get sneak dmg on queen and Earl on public servers
---
How is it? I was with a full team of 8 yesterday in a private world and it took us almost the whole 25 minutes to kill it. We were all shooting the Wendigo colossus and its health was ridiculous despite some of us having magic weapons too
---
Today I did the event and it took us 5 minutes with 4 people.
---
Most RPGs for mainstream isn't. She'd probably only have to offer me 100 caps. Seemed like the going rate to do anything In the old games.
---
I hope we can expand the interiors while inside. Got this plan to make a "tunnel" system in a cliff to have it look like some pre-war ammo depot/bunker.
---
I checked my inventory after I’d been travelling around looting for junk so not entirely sure where I picked it up as I just loot everything and then scrap and store!
---
I just would have liked to have the guy stay in the stupid mine the entire time. He faded into the ceiling with 5 minutes left into the event and that was it. Failed. Very frustrating.
---
What I do is sell all ammo I’m not using for 1 cap each. If you’re not too worried about blueprinting and building the ammo factory (technically an exploit), sell 5.56. There’s a lot of handmade users out there that’ll buy it quicker than you can supply it. Similarly, you can sell .45, as there are people that use the Fixer.
---
They must be misremembering because the datamined rewards show that you only get 1* gear from it.  Sometimes the legendaries that you got from a previous event will pop up when a new event notice happens though so that could've happened too.  Who knows?
---
Cave diver stuff for new event.
---
You *want* to stockpile to avoid farming (which if you know your gear should be super fast anyways to get explicitly what you need for repairs or to craft legendaries, since there’s not much purpose for farming otherwise)
---
You *want* to have a large collection of items for your vendor, which I’m sure probably sit there for a while, as mine do since the only thing people want are god rolls anyways, and there’s no point in sitting on those.  You get something good, and try to sell it on the market right away.  If you can’t sell it or trade it,  you scrip it.  No point in saving something people didn’t want.  Worst case, have a friend help you mule it, you can even just use your mule as your vendor. 
---
A one time event is hardly a big deal. You can go out and farm most of the materials pretty easy, it’s only a handful of tougher ones that would be beneficial to stockpile.  Once the event ends, this issue goes away.
---
Even before first came out, I kept my stash box around 400 out of 800.  I have my set of SBQ/Nuke Zone gear, crafting items like sugar, salt, pepper, etc, some supplies for repairs and building my camp, and that’s it..
---
Everything else, sell, scrip, or leave on the ground (or be nice and drop it in a bag)
---
Even if they gave everyone a scrap box, they’d be on here a week later complaining about the 800 lbs still because now their box is filled with what they thing is good weapons/armor that no ones buying, useless plans that they will never sell, mounds of various chems and other aid items that they will never use, and then a handful ot junk items that they display at their camps.  
---
The only thing the 1st scrap box does is give you a place to put scrap, scrap you will never use and will simply accumulate endlessly because there isn’t enough need for it in the game.
---
Vendor bots and cap stashes are a good easy source of caps, pick up everything and sell it, some outfits are worth more than others but pick up golf outfits, straight jackets space suits and ranger outfits if you see them, bulk junk to sell and off load excess chems to them, the perk pharma pharma will mean you can get more out of medical containers for more to sell. Kill graffton monsters they drop 15-20 caps, I kill the one by Poseidon while I’m in the area doing the energy plants cap stash run, then head into Charleston where there’s 2 cap stashes on the fire breathers exam run, keep following the river past the Charleston building and another graffton will pop up, you can then clear enemies from Wade airport for 20 caps reward and they are super mutants so they drop caps on their bodies too, then you can go over the bridge to do the riverside cap stash run, from there head to whitesprings there’s cap stashes and the ghouls drop caps, if your lucky you’ll find a few odd caps in the washing machines in the laundry building,  from there you can go to black water mine as there’s 2 cap stashes there. You can look up all the cap stash runs online and make your own route taking in a vendor along the way to offload things like assault rifles, combat rifles etc (around 30 caps each) and also any workshops, you don’t need to claim the workshops just clear the enemies from them for the 20 cap reward if your passing them on your route. Formula P, charisma bobble heads, sweet roll, and grape mentats and hard bargain 3 will get you better vendor prices. With charisma buffing aid items and hard bargain 3 I can sell mutation serums to vendor bots for 500 caps each so if I see serums selling in player vending machines for 100-200 caps il pick them up and sell them off to the vendor bot for more. Mothman egg omelettes are worth making too, I collect 28 eggs from mount pleasant and with the super duper perk turn them into enough omelettes to usually net me 372 caps or thereabouts, again with hard bargain and charisma buffs. The chef vendor at whitesprings sells the sweet roll recipe if you don’t have it and the Enclave medical wing should have the grape mentats recipe as grape mentats and sweet roll will help boost your charisma and get you better prices
---
I think I wasn’t fully grouped up one time and I got kicked from the game the other and I tried fast travel back in but it just put me outside I’ll have to try to quick travel if it happens again.
---
It doesn't scale, I promise. Solo with TSE mingun hes down in about 8 seconds, same with team of 8.
---
Sweet, thanks man!
---
Congrats, I got 100% on 76 a couple of weeks ago on PC, and on FO4 a few months ago. I still need just the caravan achievements in NV, and for some reason FO3 doesn’t have achievements on PC. 
---
I’m going to have to learn how to win at Caravan sometime...
---
Patch 22
---
How much you want for the unyielding harpoon gun???
---
Curious how fast you can do it with just the perk cards and weapons. No buffs/meds.
---
I’m running a medic build so I can keep my team alive and I burn through stims like crazy. Luckily I have almost 1000
---
I was able to do the fight without dying once, and I was the guy luring in all the wendigos. I had blocker active with a full suit of Secret Service armor on. A guy with an explosive 50cal would spray on the crowd as I stim'd. The entire group only had 4 deaths tops, with most of them being the power armor users. Rest of us were stealth builds. We had a group of 5. Defeated in 20 minutes.
---
We havent tested with melee yet but as long as you can stay in caution same thing should apply :)
---
All she would need to do is a inspiring speech. Hell we get convinced by random robots to do the most pointless stuff all throughout the game and we do it lol narratively we just do things for shits
---
I tried shooting the legs ... didn't seems to make a difference (on ps4)
---
*whoosh*
---
Never played 1 or 2 but agree they are iconic.
---
Also aren't the Floaters from those games as well?  As well as the coming BoS bunker from them as well?  Is the guass rifle allowed to be counted?
---
And since Nuclear Winter gets more ignored than adventure, Fortnite is not getting strongly looked at is it.
---
Yea, that's the most likely scenario.  I have got a 1* SS piece.  But all the legedairies are scrip fodder from this event. Which is fine.
---
TSE minigun + One Gun Army does the crippling of 3 commandos tho
---
We operate in the shadows.
---
A considerate person would not build near event zones.
---
Man. Here I thought solo'ing in 10-15 with a BE flamer was impressive. Bravo man!
---
&gt; Not to mention that people who have spent 25 years preparing abandon their vault entirely
---
I'll take that a step further.  They talk in the vault being the "best &amp; the brightest" - so they weren't all a bunch of babies.  So - like, what did they do in those 25 years?  I'm assuming they ... had kids ?  Got married?  Did that all just end on reclamation day?
---
I'm surprised they didn't turn vault 76 into some sort of cyrozone (like fallout 4, admittedly) - to better explain the timed release of new people.  
---
This would also not be an issue either;  as they wouldn't have spent 25 years bonding.
---
This is with full team, as soon as I shoot with TSE he's gone,
---
Would be quicker but he was moving, about same solo.
---
https://youtu.be/WcjL7OQRYzE
---
Plus people have posted the resistance and health numbers, they're fixed
---
Before the event was even a thing?? Sure dude.
---
Ok great, I'll give that a go -- my sneak and snipe gameplay is fun when I'm going solo but less enjoyable when taking on the Queen etc. Thanks for the reply.
---
.... Never heard of this.. Does it work with a musket?
---
No way to stop it aside from marsupial and a jet pack
---
Do you have more than one Tesla in your inventory?
---
Well yeah. Even the 100 caps is worthless. Just happy as long as I can sink my axe into some skulls.
---
I’m a junkies PA heavy build, Chem fiend &amp; travelling pharmacy, Party Boy with whisky as it adds +6 strength which helps at times, There really isn’t any specific addiction perks, Field Surgeon &amp; super stimpacks will see you through the Colossus Problem fight without dying.
---
This does help mate, much appreciated. I'm sold, so thank you. Nah I'm unaware of any objects that are indestructible. I currently live under the road near watoga, exits and entrances block off be concrete floors, with a little hole I can jump in and out of lol.
---
Oh btw people build right next to the SBQ sometimes and people nuke away from it. Solid attempt though.
---
I agree that this happened to me, him going through the ceiling and the floor. But I still like the event. It’s a welcomed change.
---
Hey mate that's still great going! I reckon with practice and the right buffs you can get that down even further!
---
I use a double barrel in vats and I swear I can 1/100th of his health bar drop. That feels like an accomplishment to me.
---
I personally think the most raider thing you can do is side with Foundation, then give half the gold to Crater. The settlers do all the work, the raiders don't have to do anything or risk their people and they still get half.  If you do that, Foundation gives you 300 rep and Crater give you 900.
---
There's even a line some raiders will say afterwards that says "I wish I could have seen their faces when you gave us half the gold!"
---
well we did it on a private so no one lost out :)
---
They both suck but at least I can get easy screws from ACP
---
the buffs play a huge part tbh, I imagine we'd lose a solid 10 seconds
---
Glad someone picked up on that LOL
---
yeah 140 damage resist, better than 0.
---
Using the stealth suit is how I finished the quest -- had to be cunning and sneaky rather than balls-out attacks. So I did sneak attacks where I'd empty my clip into him, then melt away into the shadows until I reloaded and my AP recharged.. rinse and repeat, and repeat and repeat.
---
That's still good though man! :)
---
I think the nerf is specifically going to target things like this. From what I've read the way buffs currently work is they all stack multiplicative with buffs from different sources. The current damage changes on the PTS are the damage buffs stacking additivly instead.
---
I agree to an extent, I’m level 286 and can solo the event myself, if your a lower level and know you can’t do much damage, help those who can do the damage so everyone can have a successful event, such as running as a medic, or keeping the swarms of Windigos of of higher levels. However with that said, if you are a low level ( that means you whoever is reading this, and your character is in 2 digit numbers on ur level) and you come thinking your level 30 pipe pistol with 10 rounds is gonna help, don’t waste other people’s time. Also don’t come down here asking people for fusion cores, you look stupid and ridiculous with an empty power armor rack, moving like a turtle
---
That's it, even if you stay in caution, anyone else spotted breaks the sneak bonus for everyone present. So it shouldn't be possible unless it's a bug or melee sneak dmg is different from ranged but that seems unlikely
---
Vault 94 Raids - all imbalanced, broken challenges, worthless XP.  Kept complaining, and eventually they just pulled the content entirely.  It was definitely never sold as seasonal content that was planned to be temporary.
---
SBQ glitches and flyaway behavior - in game since launch.  She'll still "land" and walk around way up in the sky, fly underground, break and stop taking damage, etc.
---
I've also been throughout Vault 96 and Vault 63 (glitched in shortly after launch - could access all vaults until well into 2019), both were completely scrapped after 94 went poorly.  There's been no mention of them since.  63 was looking like it could be pretty cool but I guess we'll never know.
---
Presidential storyline - was reportedly almost ready in the fall of 2018.  There are ballot printers all over the damn map, the president's office is still there with the computer that takes presidential seals in exchange for special armor.  Race for the Presidency is still in the game technically - but we'll almost certainly never see it.  I mean, it's been two fucking years and they can't wrap it up.
---
I'm convinced the crew that launched the game has entirely quit by now - nothing they almost finished has ever made it to the actual finish line to date.
---
Yes fences snap together, but do not snap to foundations/floors. No they can not be broken.
---
Yes the bunker can be broken - although I've only seen it broken from a nuke.
---
Oh, there's currently no gate for the fence. Don't know if one is coming or not.
---
Sadly - I normally run an unarmed build...but you really need the PA in there so I'm buggered.
---
I did use my speedy gatling gun but was only averaging about 8 damage a shot. I think if I could have gone without PA and not had to worry about the storm leaving I might have done better against the swarms though.
---
Wow, I was gonna like your post, then I read your edit and it turned into a dislike
---
Yeah those guns and some mobs are from the original game. 
---
I was extremely surprised to see that bunker in season 2 rewards and it gave me slight hope that not all is lost :)
---
But then they dropped those moo moo outfits....
---
I was going to suggest the same. That's exactly where I got mine when I was starting. It's usually off in one of the side rooms at the beginning area of the event, so you won't even need to go near the actual event until you feel you're ready (it's a bit of a challenge at any level). If you're on Xbox, I still have mine that I used I think, so I'd be happy to donate it if you do have trouble finding one in the wild. GT is same as my reddit.
---
I am level 390 and have pretty much played since the beginning.  If Flux suddenly disappears after it drops this is the first I have ever heard, I always thought someone picked it out of the bag you left.
---
Were those high damage numbers mainly because of the chems and such or because of perks?
---
Correct, it's entirely possible though that he was running with other sneak builds at the time
---
Thanky you, much appreciated. Well time to rebuild my camp. Currently looks like a crack den, it's cool but I've put grown it, well ran out of room to put stuff. Cheers.
---
Np, be safe out there man
---
Stay well rested, eat cranberry foods, tasty squirrel soup, and canned meat stew. 
---
Then join events with exclamation marks for free fast travel and Molotov everything.
---
I’m a bloodied heavy gunner build and it’s great if not perfect for ACP. You not only deal a lot of damage but heavy weapons have huge magazine sizes, so reloading isn’t a big issue. Using power armor with emergency protocols and need rage also prevents you from dying *too* much lol. Sadly my best heavy is a Bloodied Explosive .50 and although it’ll kill most enemies with a few shots, Earle is almost entirely immune to explosive damage so it’s effectively a 1* .50. I just got a B25 Gatling Plasma so hopefully that’ll be the perfect heavy against him lol. That or any other B25 heavy
---
Thanks my friend sure it can,but that is amazing for two minutes alone with no sneak to get adrenaline boil in my chest and survive event I am bloodied build it’s amazing!Also all times I have been escaped mine!Love that event so much!Good luck to you my friend
---
its an executioner cursed harpoon 
---
	+50% damage when your target is below 40% health
---
90% reduced weight 
---
Bashing damage increased by 40%
---
herbal tea. it's medicinal.
---
Both good options!
---
Holy shit. That's insane, but with weapons like that it's obvious that its gonna be melted in mere seconds. I doubt that youd be able to kill it solo in 8 seconds though with that one weapon though. Sounds very unlikely
---
Haven't run it lately, but last did it was 2 guys with teslas. They grinded my fps to nothing, never recovered until I left the mine (pc). Other than that been good.
---
True enough!  So I wonder why heavy gunners (the majority) aren't using One Gun Army?  I've attended many Colossal Problem events and have yet to see heavy gunners crippling Earl to the point he will stand still.
---
I dont care, I clear mobs, Sorry I am not up to spend 1K ammo per event
---
This might be good for after the nerf, since everything will be significantly less powerful. Make SBQ and Earl not regenerate, but get a random mutation and maybe some other buffs instead. Ammo expenditure is ridiculous already for Earl if you aren't using magic weapons or that bananas commando build. I used 3000 rounds of 2mm gauss minigun ammo on him the last time, and I've got a dedicated bloodied heavy weapons build.
---
Thanks :) I just wish there was reliable source of info on how these things work so we wouldn't have to test every single thing manually
---
Oh man, I think next season has some rad rewards. Way better than season 1 IMO. I can’t wait.
---
private server? (too lazy to read all the comments and replies, and also technically at work "working" so... yah...
---
i cant imagine having a public server group managing this with the onslaughts of trigger happy dick bags jumping around all nimbly pimbly raising a ruccous and ruining any chance of swift stealth... 
---
I ran this 3x last night, its fun, but players ... many players (not all) lack the self control to make THIS happen in public lol
---
You spend the same amount of ammo. Maybe a tiny bit more.
---
Can solo it in the same time, slightly quicker actually as I get him before he starts moving. About 5 or 6 secs max
---
The Wendigo scream does a little damage and drops your AP, and I don't think Fireproof has any effect on it.
---
Awesome good thing...i tried him 2 times n public got killed last time and it took me out of the mine and I could not loot earl😪isn't there a red chest in there somewhere?
---
I have no idea if it would work with the lore or not, but it's a splendid idea. Maybe they could replace the molerats? ;)
---
Just my opinion !  SBQ is so easy to solo and not even a challenge with 8 people. So the colossal problem actually give me a event where I need to focus more, I still solo it but as a bloodied commando I have to keep an eye at my health and falling fire 😅
---
All I've got is cups of noodles.
---
He's creating a post right now of how bloodied builds and Earle should be nerfed
---
agreed!
---
I dump a bunch of ultracite plans at train stations all the time.   A lot of people do.
---
I've used alcohol and mentats occasionally in previous games to pass speech checks but that's really it. No benefit for fights really.
---
It's not hard but it really sucks when you're the only one hitting Earle.
---
Kinda ballsy to ask Bethesda to actually make the game playable.   Are you new here?
---
;)
---
&gt;The end of event glitch where you die and can't respawn before the boss dies is made even worse during this event because of how damn often you die. Another bug which is actually a feature is when the respawn timer is extended every time you die,
---
Yeah the respawn bug is a bitch, but I disagree on the other "issue".
---
There should be consequences to dying, this game doesn't need to be made easier, you should have to actually think about what you're doing in an endgame boss fight.
---
You nuke like me that's a good spot for queen.
---
yah, i think its the source of this glitch for sure (taking damage even if not actually)
---
and i know im not, because i change NOTHING now even full bloodied with all the things that people think make it more common, and i click slower and i FT fine second attempt more than 1/2 the time when its ailed...  where as other times i have to run 100 meters away from where i was (i used to wonder if it was problem spots in the map?)
---
Heavy gunner/shotgun, the trick is the damage while blocking on armour. That's why I dont wear PA.
---
Come patch 22 that weapon will be shit :-)
---
r/woooosh
---
I'm on xbox 2, and the lag gets to the point of making the game unplayable.
---
I do not, I one shot everything, hair trigger reciever makes me shot as fast as I want, 4K ammo lasts me weeks.
---
Hi mate, Yes it was on a private :)
---
And considering that, your minigun was doing 1 damage per hit on that colossus and had 999 bullets in the mag without going down. I'm sure this is a glitch with your magic weapons.
---
Your first drop is one of the most desired items in the game right now. As far as I now there's no outfit to match it but it goes well with lots of things
---
Ya because of bethesda reasons sometimes fast traveling back in doesn't work. Sometimes it does. I try and if not i just wait outside to at least get reward for event.
---
Ah I see, I forgot all about the vault raids... all that work on those raids just badly designed with timers within such a bad server network, It really does seem like they don’t play the game themselves.
---
Vendor hopping is basically end game.  Lol.
---
Not worth it plus staggering at queens is not well thought of. At least imo.
---
Snatch up some bargains and make a pretty penny!
---
Cola nut perk. It’s underrated as hell and basically everyone of those flavors do something useful. Quantum’s full heal, grape takes all rads away and full heals.
---
I think the problem is casual players, I have friends that absolutely refuse to min max their characters and use pitiful weapons and I don’t even invite them if I plan on doing endgame content because they’re really just meat shields and they’re barely geared enough to do that. Like yesterday someone insisted on using a Tesla rifle and I thought to myself cool but not helping dude.
---
That mag glitch happens on lots of weapons, and yes I said it's the magic effect doing it.
---
Yeah man there is :) - it's near the entrance but tbh the best bet is to actually stay in the mine after you kill earl and farm wendigos for exp, junk and ammo :)
---
The carry weight part im not so sure about, but hell yeah to the lamp thing
---
Crippling doesn't seem to work here. I took my main with a bloodied railway rifle as a rifleman and crippling perks and intentions. Crippled every single body part in two minutes and Earl was still moving around, screeching, etc. I was hitting minions for 1300 and Earl for 200.
---
So, I took care of minions and let the heavy gunners do their job while I killed maybe 200 wendigos. I might have caused 8K of damage to him, but we failed.
---
"Oooohh cause it meak week, meat week (humming)"
---
it's less about the rewards and more about the fact that doing my daily chores like a good boy sucked all the joy out of the game for me.
---
Patch 22 hopefully early September when 1st season ends and second begins.
---
If you spent your entire life outside the vault then the whole part where you explore around and see everything for the first time wouldn’t make sense, every fallout game involves leaving a vault and seeing the world ruined.
---
If you on PC I'll team up and show you if you like :-)
---
Yeah I would agree. This is a really fun event and I would much rather run this than the queen. I am glad there is an armor and weapon workbench in the tunnel but it is tedious to change perks back and forth
---
If you had 22 diseases you'd be doing enough damage that you wouldn't even need a weapon.
---
I think 4 is enough, they just need to scale it up and add perks to support dieases
---
Encrypted even drops them. This def should. I haven’t had a chance to try but people said you get a lot of ammo back from mobs. Is this true?
---
Nope, it's never picked out, it's gone.
---
No one knows if it's a bug or a feature, but SBQ &amp; CP have it.
---
That's strange if it does that. SBQ can get hit with sneak damage if others there or even in the party are spotted and even tanking the queen.
---
So is sneak broken in the mine instance?
---
I do this. Sort of a Tank role, all the wendigos stay around me too. Giving everyone else freedom to just fire at him.
---
More like they keep switching out the tablecloth and dishes while players are trying to eat a salad made of mostly whole cherry tomatoes
---
That's the main problem and what I'm going to say may sound impopular but low levels should stay away of the event because they take the place of someone who could actually help. Anyway is normal that everyone wants to be in right now...
---
Are the shotguns fixed too? I was really enjoying actually having a useful shotgun again lol
---
Word of advice if that happens again, load back in as quick as possible, locate a person in the mine join public team with that person or invite to public team, then fast travel on that person, should put you right back inside the mine.
---
You can also play a clean Berserk with no armor: with the right perks and enough practice I've been able to fight in ACP and the SBQ fights with no problem
---
Yeah noticed that too.
---
I hate when people delete their comments.  What was the woosh for? What did they say?
---
3000 caps
---
Every event should come with plushie plans. They're probably my favourite camp object. Wish there was more. Especially the rest of the Unstoppables.
---
Oh I got screwed alright.
---
I go back and forth view wise. If you use 50cal in third person, it has amazing Zoom. It's almost like an auto sniper rifle 😂
---
Unfortunately I'm not. Not sure why I expected it to work XD
---
I'm willing to bet it's engine problems for fallout 76, eso was made with a better engine, and incorporating text chat in a new engine would be...difficult. then again i'm not a programmer, so i think bethesda is just understaffing their f76 team since there's a chat mod up on nexus for pc
---
Wahala. My thumbs up even them your are welcome.
---
Some of us are both!  lol
---
I feel this so hard. I'm constantly fumbling through the emotes to hit 'yes' when i mean 'thank you' and '??' when I mean, 'I *see you*, why are you *following* me??' Or having someone shoot at me or hit me with a machete when they mean, 'Hey, you. I have spare plans I threw on the floor, you want these?' Even if what ends up in the text chat is garbled txt tlk, at least it would be better communication than spinning in a circle trying to figure out what another player without a mic wants from me.
---
&gt; my tse tesla.
---
The ash pile issue still exists.  Did ACP yesterday a guy who exclusively used a tesla was in the group.  By the end of the event most of the cave had become pixelated and laggy.
---
Totally understand where you're coming from, yeh noobs and teslas make me laugh tbh. They think right, I've got a tesla, I've got a BE weapon I'm god, let's go... When endgamers no that's not how it works, it takes ages to make a decent build, I've lost count how many times I've changed mine, even now I need to grind again to get a perk back.. There is no perfect build but work needs to be done if you wanna compete.
---
This hasn’t been my experience at all.  Crippling Earl won’t completely imobilize him, but it slows him down considerably.  
---
I’m guessing you’re on console?   Give it time and keep trying.  It takes players a few days to start figuring it out.  A week in and PC players are getting much better.
---
Awesome
---
What??? I'll give you 10k caps and some Tato salad, take it or leave it.
---
Yea every time we find something enjoyable, they have to ‘fix’ it as top priority, meanwhile it still takes five tries to ‘fast’ travel.
---
Where are they in the CAMP build stuff? I looked in lights and couldn't find them.
---
Yes, wendigo spawns gives you the ammo you used on them, even fuel and ultracite ammo. Not cores and grenades tho
---
They do drop a fuck load of stim packs in my experience, I wouldn't be surprised on ammo too, but I use melee so don't focus on it
---
I would suspect that based on the numbers they are not losing people over an in game chat, which is why they haven’t implemented it.
---
That is great TY
---
U must have alot of caps 
---
U on ps4?
---
Wait... isn't that saying the same thing twice?
---
Canonically, the Gunner Runners won’t exist for another 50 years or so but I think OP just wants guns, runners not so much.
---
Yes, this is a very good idea.
---
Anybody willing to trade the tenderizer and maybe mods? I regularly get the cow costume parts and have the flag and bloody grillmaster outfit I can offer you. I'm on PS4 btw.
---
Yeah, the Gauss Rifle has a number of issues, including the VATS "accuracy" bug.
---
You're better off with a Fixer or Handmade.
---
Big same
---
gratz, I did her quest for over a week. Only 1 star items, wasn't worth the time imo. Guess I should give it another go.  
---
However she is on a different cooldown timer. Like 24 hours or so after completing.
---
Agreed, ESO does fine with a text chat, and it’s usually being used.
---
12 gauge avada kedavra.
---
Both. We opted to drop damage mitigating perks or perks that some people may consider essential (like starched genes, serendipity etc) in favor of anything that can squeeze that extra bit of damage in. We stacked a lot of Perks. Psychotats is +25% DMG and Blight Soup is +40% Crit DMG to name a couple
---
Ok how would fps even affect it?? Thats just bizarre they would be related. On another note, my magic goes away when in the cave too because I drop from 40-50 down to 20-30s..
---
Or sell all the junk you pick up to any ai vendor.
---
You can move the mouse in the panic run, not sure on consoles but maybe.
---
Best weapon for aiming... miss miss miss miss miss...
---
Yeah also since my second run I equip luck of the draw and lucky break, but I need those points for something else
---
It's hard to know though until you've done that event for the first time. 
---
The other thing is - if you don't have a full instance even a low level character doing something might be better than nothing.
---
So non-power armor people are screwed in this event?
---
Same here. I'm the guy that joins whatever faction gives me the coolest shit.
---
well conversations happen everyday   
---
It's quite active nowadays; Sure wasn't as much before Wastelanders, but since then its been growing up nicely. It seems your experience of it is outdated.
---
Isn't the whole game still trash?
---
&gt;Nope, casual bloodied it still takes like 8 from a B2525 handmade to kill a should sometimes.
---
Then your build is wrong or you are playing it wrong.
---
&gt; Also, bloodied builds are the main reason why queens are able to be killed within the time limit 
---
Not true, legacy weapons, junkies, and proper heavy guns builds make that possible even if no bloodied is there. I've done the SBQ with one other person a few times, both builds at the time were neither blooded or junkies with out legacies.
---
I doubt it.
---
It’s should be 30 seconds MAX. Min is too long. I don’t mind the dieing and I think they still can work on few things in event to make it better but with all the other respawn bugs it’s frustrating.
---
This was the exact comment i was gonna put! There are days where if i get one shit roll right off the bat, i wait ten minutes, try one more time, and if it is shit agn, then server hop and wait longer instead of blowing thru modules
---
I've had this happen ever since legendary robots started blowing up on death. I just try to run up and loot before that happens.  Its really annoying.
---
Pick any other rifle other then the gauss. It’s fire rate is just to slow to really be viable in every situation. Try and find a good handmade or fixer. They have lower dps but you’ll get more shots off and get more dmg in a shorter time frame. The handmade is great for free aiming since it has little recoil. The fixer had a little more dps but also a lot of recoil.
---
Counter argument is we’re all previously residents of Appalachia but we don’t know where anything is at beyond a general map that we have before we even leave the vault. Narratively that makes no sense. We could just as well be a outsider.
---
It is? Oh, that would explain the downvotes. I feel bad about talking about it now.
---
That's... not how the nerf works... at all.
---
If you stay where it spawns you you'll still get the event rewards
---
Gauss Rifles are typically not the heaviest of hitters but  one thing to check is if you have the grounded Mutation as it effects Gauss damage, it may not be worth giving up the energy resistance though
---
Had a level 57 armed with only a hunting rifle join last night. He was getting bitch slapped and one-hit by the wendigo spawns...
---
5 FPS your lucky all i'm getting is 1.5 FPS
---
Mine is 625, so no problem there.
---
Holy smokes! I was not expecting to come back to so many great comments and suggestions. Thank you all for leaving your tips, I am excited to try them all and see what works best for me. In short it sounds like sell everything, ha. I have been scrapping everything I find that I won’t use and then hoarding the scrap. Sounds like I’ve been missing out on a lot of caps!
---
It's not wrong, it's casual ya dullard. Also, the queen is aost entirely resistant to explosive damage making the majority of legacy guns useless on her. Do your f*cking research dude
---
Flame thrower trap works on destroying the bunker if you’re trying to glitch things into the walls. However the floor/floating is a problem. The fences are pretty cool and work with just about any style of build. They’re hardly communist in appearance. Sure there’s a red band around the posts but it’s faded and rusty.
---
You gotta be quick lol
---
Well she killed everyone in the hideout. Doesn't mean that was everyone in the Order. There might have been some out on a supply run. Shannon Rivers did leave a message for any survivors to join the Responders, the Brotherhood or whatever. To find some way to survive. So it's not like there isn't a way to bring the Order back.
---
I sell every type of junk item at my camp. Black Titanium and even Ultracite sell the least amount out of every other mat.
---
Well that is pretty sweet
---
Would love to if I could get my hands on one with the proper magical effects.  Would sure be nice to get a gold bullion plans for it so I could craft legendary effects.  I'm just not lucky enough to A) get the drop, and B) get the drop w/ the effects needed.  I hope Bethesda adds some sort of single shot rifle to the gold bullion options.
---
Three months from now every collector will have one or two in their vendors. It's just the novelty
---
It is a great storyline. I really hoped that there would be a return of the Responders faction and with them came someone who used to be in the MoM who restarts the order with a contact in each of the other factions. Then you would occasionally get a quest from one of those contacts to help them with something.
---
The order has a lot of potential behind it.
---
Makeshift warrior?  Gunsmith?
---
Blocker
---
I mean they should have delayed it a week or so for consoles
---
So make it a mod that you can craft. A Graham and Chally related quest that you can access any time, that once you complete, gives you access to a mod for the Chally backpack, and maybe some of the loot we get during the meat Cook event, like a damage redux from animals while wearing the chef outfit.
---
It seems like it to me, it's all in the PTS together.
---
I’m on console and I want in game text chat.
---
I'm on PS4 unfortunately. I always thought that the more people in the event the more health/ damage resistance the boss has. Weird
---
Right?  If they actually took they time to play, they'd realize it's not that bad.
---
Can I ask why?
---
Fallout 76 needs a lot of things
---
Exploding bullets on the TS, then get 2 explosions. You can spec in demolition and grenadier too, well probably not demolition on a mini.
---
On a 50 cal, ts is horrible accuracy without one gun army. Mini haven't messed with a ts but probably the same.
---
oh nm just read gauss
---
The bunker looks great but the floor is weird. I also wish the foundation was a bit taller to allow it to fit better on uneven ground. 
---
The fence is great!! One of my top 5 atom shop buys ever. Snaps, rotates, has nice heighth and depth to the posts.
---
Are you? What does the TOS say about that? Is the product and service really yours?
---
Not the best explaination by OP.
---
Nuke Monogah, kill Earle. Then nuke fissure prime and both events start up.
---
I'd imagine, is it rare? Or just expensive cause the event came out yesterday?
---
The Bunker also has a bugged door sound. It uses the garage door sound, so it continues playing for 2 seconds after it's open. Buy it and then submit a ticket for a refund. You'll get a cookie cutter response asking for the name, cost and when you bought it. I put one in last night and have my atoms back already.
---
Agreed. I had gotten a bloodied explosive harpoon gun. I remember being so excited, I dressed my character up as a fisherman and hung out on ships and killed enemy. I just recently realized explosive harpoon weapons are legacy.
---
Wtf this has so many upvotes? I asked the same shit a week ago an people told me I was wrong an low lvls can do the event..
---
I used to think the same with SBQ, but it's really not the case, the extra lag and people not letting the SBQ land etc is what gives the impression she gets harder. Likely the lag contributes to Earle seeming tougher, but he really isn't..
---
Yes forgot about mentats, only used the grape one in 76 to barter, the old fallouts i always had a dress or something i could equip to raise my charisma to pass dialogue challenges.
---
PS4 won’t let me
---
I think you can obtain it as an event reward with a 6% chance or so. That means that's it's rare now but will be pretty common in some time
---
I am aware of that "issue" and that's why it is still semi auto. I was using my anti-armor telsa to manage those suckers while the heavies I was with worked on Erl, it worked out and no noticeable lag. It is a fun event IF your setup right.
---
I'm still new to using buffs but as a rule, I look for separate buff types. Like Bock (Alcohol), Psychotats (Chem), Blight Soup (Food/Drink), Bobblehead, Magazine etc
---
A reminder that this game didnt have push to talk button for months. That is the level of f*** given by devs.
---
&gt;What they should do is nerf Junkies and Bloodied a little bit and buff everything else.
---
No, they need to nerf bloodied and make other builds more viable. Junkies is marginally better than any of the next three properly done builds. A proper bloodied is about twice the damage output or more of any other build with ridiculously good survivability for what is supposed to be a glass cannon.
---
I FEEL THE NEED!
---
Would One Appalachia make a difference?
---
To my knowledge they've never even acknowledged the numerous requests for text chat. 
---
Just another common sense thing they should have had at launch.
---
I usually get 60ish from a distance but around 180ish with stealth headshots. How're you getting the 200+ shots in?
---
Once again for the people in the back who haven't heard it the last 20 times: The Queen's health doesn't change in relation to the number of people at the event.  Period. End of Discussion. 
---
Seriously, stop posting this stupid nonsense.
---
I'm wondering the same thing... Be a lvl 5 boss for lvl 5 players
---
As far as I'm aware, you can only have one effect active at a time from each type of food/drug.
---
One food effect, one drink effect, one alcohol effect, and one chem effect.
---
However, I do believe there are specific chems that you can stack, I'm just not sure which ones.
---
You are now known as gods among men
---
Gold bullion plans for what?
---
Yeah it's a permanent event so I'd imagine it's not gonna be impossible. I'm just glad these newer events have cosmetic rewards, something about it feels different than the same prime weapon plan.
---
what do you mean "back?" It's in the game now.
---
Just wait around. I've had it happen plenty of times but if you wait a little bit it will turn into a metal pile close to where it blew up
---
Thanks, both of you. I'll keep it all in mind, asking with Abby other advice I get here!
---
though to be fair the Presidential storyline was (completely) scrapped and removed when they changed their focus of PvP-themed to a PvE-themed game after realizing that is what the major part of the community wanted. They could bring it back if they ever balanced weapons in PvP but for now just removed everything that was tied to that questline.
---
Its permanent, not temporary
---
Wait I thought there was the daily cap pool limit? Can't sell past 1400 unless you buy something putting it back up
---
Honestly I think Pack Rat is better than bear arms.  You have what, 20 lbs of heavy guns?  I always have more junk than that.
---
Meat week goes another day (started last Thursday). Colossal Problem is a regular event.
---
Lore wise it would work because timeline it split off at the Cold War so the garand would exist
---
I’m like 90% certain this event is here to stay, ACP is now one of the three permanent Endgame Raid Bosses. Meat week is the limited time one, it comes back every summer.
---
&gt;This will be the hardest boss fight you have ever experienced. 
---
Haha, bugged "magic" ultracite gatling laser go BRRRRRRRRT!
---
Vats kinda works if you push it three times (in-out-in). It solves most of 95% accuracy fails
---
This is a good idea.
---
I only mentioned that because they seem dead set on nerfing those two.
---
It could be incorporated into a new armor set (or even mod) giving the damage tanking and durability of PA but making it weight a ton.
---
&gt;one gun army
---
Whats number 2?
---
Yea lets listen to the guys who are putting in a lot of hours into this game have best gear and know best farming locations their experience for sure will translate to average casual player experience :V
---
I agree, I had around 10 or so improved repair kits and ripped them all pretty quickly
---
If they are unique or creative then I can appreciate the thought that went behind it but if it’s just delete the floor underneath me or something then no.

Weapon is a B2525 Handmade. Ignore the weapon on the right. I was looking to see what build+weapon would work best post-nerf (spoiler: still bloodied but now it sucks). 
---
Build is max commando and stealth. Sometimes I'd switch over and grab a few spawns for adrenaline bonus. Tenderizer really helps.
---
Some men just want to watch the world burn.
---
You could probably get an only trade item right now for it. In two weeks you'll be lucky if you get 10000c
---
1. I believe the gauss rifle (and pistol) are broken at the moment. in a bid to fix gauss shotguns, they reduced uncharged shots even further. except they did so for all gauss weaponry (minus the minigun) when only the shotgun was broken. don't think it's been fixed yet.
---
2. the only realistic way to kill the SBQ in 10 seconds is with bugged or hacked weapons. you could buff yourself to hell as a melee build for some speedrun on youtube, but I said realistically.
---
3. there are several viable builds in the game. sneak commando, PA heavy gunner. bloodied, junkie's, vampire's. melee. riflemen in particular aren't very good though. and they're in an even worse spot right now with gauss rifles being bugged. although no one comes close in terms of ammo efficiency, and come the nerf you might be the only one still able to reliably one shot things.
---
also, yes, the damage displayed in the pipboy is considering charged shots. uncharged it's 50% if memory serves.
---
You just described Warframe
---
This is the way.
---
It's also extremely lazy game development to force the community to invent third party solutions for missing features many games in the genre already include as defaults. Especially when the mods are only available for players on certain platforms.
---
I agree with this sentiment. I have seen trap camps which are 100% self sufficient and I appreciate the time and effort clearly put into them.
---
I have the pepper and salt mod unlocked if you manage to grab a tenderizer let me know and I’ll mod it for you
---
my favorite post of the week!
---
Also, a Colossal Problem based title would be good.
---
I know melee food buffs stack. Or did according to a turtle video I saw
---
I still enjoy both... I nuke the SBQ twice, and then finish up with ACP. SBQ still has better loot for me, but the ACP fight is fun for me. 
---
LOL love how you got downvoted for expressing your opinion. (effin Reddit &lt;3)
---
Is meat week still going on?
---
I dont get it either. I assume thst most of those players have just dont have much else to do in the game. Or they just ebjoy Messing with People a bit too much.
---
That Grelock stuff just doesn't interest me at all...
---
Next week should be something about going back to school
---
I think once I've identified a trap base, it's fun for me to try and beat it. Usually, at least on Xbox, they use LFG posts advertising sales at their camp to lure in victims. They are easy to spot, usually with lines like "selling legacies in my stash to help the community" or "I'm quitting the game, dropping legacies at my camp", so I always join to see how hard it is to get to the vendor or wherever they are hiding. When I do, they usually get extra salty and server hop. 
---
But as far as running a camp like that? Takes a special kind of patient douchebag for that. And I should know...
---
That's not me.  In terms of farming locations, you can just Google them or I'll tell you.  Lucky hole mine, mine all the lead deposits with excavator pa, get about 400 lead ore, then go to the flooded train yard and kill all the snallygasters there, then go to Tenagra town and kill all the cave crickets in the top of the tree.  Server hop a few times.  Now you have about 1000 lead, not joking.  Then just pick up steel weapons and scrap them with scrapper or just buy steel for caps, super cheap.
---
Ok, I hope they nerf it for you, so you could come naked at level 3 to the party and have fun.
---
The "nerf" is just because they're changing percentage based damage bonuses from multiplicative to additive.  This will allow them to more easily balance the game going forward.
---
Guess what's in the shop
---
Meh, not for me this week.
---
As usualy TY for the post. Look forward to checking out on lunch every teusday
---
Another week, another lack of Vertiguard PA 😔
---
Or you know... Get higher lvl then do it? Me, and 2 people I play with frequently, get though the event fairly easily. Yea we might die a couple of times but we are all around lvl 100-ish, and no we dont have hacked weapons or armor.... So I mean, it's completely doable if you know what you're doing
---
This happens on occasion with me. I'll drop something and it just disappears. I'd you're giving to someone else or an alt put it in a container. I tend not to drop anymore.
---
Me neither, I really can’t see many people using it
---
DMV is a government run service, that should tell you alot about about the schools and roads.
---
Is the “order of the crossed axes” mentioned anywhere in the lore?
---
But the plushie tho
---
Also you can earn a lot of junk with trap camps. You’d be surprised by how many high level players carry around unnecessary amounts of junk.
---
Dang, I was really looking forward to that throne.
---
Thi post scared me! Thought they had disabled a colossal problem
---
I just completed it solo in private world and it seemed to run pretty smooth, this was on XB1.
---
Doubt your build is ready by then though.
---
There is no "casual" bloodied build. There is either a build done right or a build done wrong, you're the dullard. Fix your build or stop whining.
---
&gt;Also, the queen is aost entirely resistant to explosive damage making the majority of legacy guns useless on her.
---
You obviously need to do some research, aside from how to do a proper build. Legacy and any explosive weapons work good on the SBQ if it has a decent rate of fire. There are quite a few different build and weapon combinations that work well on the SBQ but there are plenty that are crap too.
---
Edit: btw, you are the type of people I'm carrying in the SBQ fight all the time. People like you get heavy to carry some times.
---
Not allowed to not like the new toy, I guess.
---
It’s not going away...
---
What weapon is the staff a skin for?
---
I’ve yet to see one.   I mean, I’ve got a switch rigged to a buttload of hidden rad emitters next to a sign that says ‘don’t flip this switch’
---
But that doesn’t really count, despite the number of bloodied players it’s killed
---
Can still one shot all movs that arent earl,sbq, or sheepsquatch on pts. This is with an instigating explosive shotty
---
It probably actually is like that, but just bugged.
---
This issue is still here. All bit 2 dailies and weeklies were marked complete, with no score added.
---
Console people probably have experience with it now and realize they were full of shit haha
---
Is it just me or is this week a bit disappointing? I was hoping for some new camp items
---
They can be quite fun and creative.. I kinda like the idea of not every camp being friendly.. but also can be a bit annoying!
---
On a side note, one of the best camps I saw was a maze camp, think it was called ‘Kenji’s maze’... no traps just a maze puzzle to get to the vending machine.. longest I have spent at anyone’s camp! Great idea.
---
Don't get on the spit would be my advice.
---
That Grelock outfit and Staff are kind of cool I have to say. Not for a Fallout game though.
---
I'll consider looking to import it into Skyrim and have it be the base outfit for my next Dragonborn. Although for some reason Fallout 76 meshes are enormous compared to Skyrim meshes. Last time I tried to take a look at the Pip-Boy in Outfit Studio the thing was half as big as my whole character.
---
That is an old topic as old as the game itself. There was a post that showed gamesfiles with most of the stuff in it. So someone just has to activate those mods. Topic comes up every 6 month but nothing ever happens.
---
Grognak's Axe.
---
September 1st Atom Shop update for those debating between paying rent or buying atoms rn
---
Its not a nerf to one shotting, its all dps. Youre going to apend around 2x ammo going forward
---
They really need to give us either a Nukatron and/or make the Nuka Cola plant functioning as a workshop.
---
Ok, i did'nt know that. Thought junk was the one thing you always made sure was safe in the stash.
---
I guess I’m really just pissed I missed rewards, I missed my before work nap for this 😂
---
The wizard stuff is an easy pass, but that Thanksgiving table and chairs is appealing.
---
If Ps4 many in my vendors for 20 caps
---
That's a hacked weapon....
---
This exact thing happened to me last night and it pissed me off cause of the chance that I got a cursed weapon from was gone
---
I will NEVER be low on screws
---
Someone using an automatic tesla rifle ?
---
Vintage Nukashine.
---
Title suggestion:
---
Atom shop update for those ready to be disappointed... again.
---
This post is satire.
---
Assault gas mask I think, or it's called assault raider gas mask.
---
I just wish they added another minute or two to the end timer so you have more time to loot.
---
Might be the spinning drill lol
---
“Help! My Glitched Gun is having a glitch and can’t be repaired” so sad, Siri play despacito.
---
Free curtains? That’s nice. Probably going to get that plushie but that’s about it
---
Assault gas mask I think.  I am sure someone will correct me if I am wrong.
---
I've noticed the mask goes with a lot of outfits. It's a nicely fitting helmet and it's look works with a lot. Even the nurses outfit gives it a creepy 1920s war anticipating feel.
---
**That moment when Leroy Jenkins ISN'T there to screw everything up.**
---
They need to add a Responder-tron
---
I did one recently where I only put in a few shots because someone else was melting it and I was still fine, so...
---
My issue is that last night my team and I had to wait 60 seconds rach time We died before being able to rejoin. Which I believed to cause us to lose the battle each time re launched the nuke
---
*feature*
---
Thank you. I will do so :)
---
This could be a job for the personal terminal.
---
No vertibird power armor??? BIG L.
---
What a tool. I like to do the Uranium event with all the mole miners. I use a bloodied sledge hammer and can one shot them, but I intentionally change to a shock baton when the terminated management announcement comes on. That way I can beckon everyone over and all kill him together.
---
Xbox here, it was the laggiest, most frustrating thing I've ever experienced in a video game.
---
Yeah it is a pretty common thing. Path of Exile is the other one that stands out to me.
---
Even the helmet isn't worth much for pc.  Just sell it right now.
---
New plushie!
---
free curtains, i guess.
---
never have i been more ambivalent towards something.
---
Hopefully it had a roof or something. I tried to do a hedge type maze but with so many marsupial people they just jump over the walls.
---
The energy explosions ignore explosion and energy resist, and do max damage per shot, instead of 20%/5
---
You surely don't expect that PA to hit the store before the actual Steel Dawn patch, right? Otherwise you're going to get another 2-3 disappointing Atom shop updates.
---
I kinda think it’s cute , those are the same people who think this game is difficult and mats are hard to find lol , only thing I’ve ever had issues causing me to actively farm it was mole rat teeth and that’s only because I break them into bone
---
Same, I logged on 7-8 minutes after the reset as well.. Pretty annoying, couldve finished the run with this weeks challenges
---
There was in my attempt, literally like 2 fps.
---
You do have a point, still waiting for the hay bales to return
---
Mine has auto completed a majority of mine as well. I’m so annoyed. I don’t know if I would have completed, but i would have been damn close.
---
Today’s should have been “update for those who are killing Earle right now”
---
I would so want to see the 10 sec one
---
Got a B FFR 1P hm from finishing a colossal problem yesterday with my usual shitty luck lol
---
From in-game lore, an ultracite vein unexpectedly grew and burst into the town of Welch, which prompted AMS to get property rights for the area and evict the residents from their homes. The already angry miners protested against AMS and sabotaged their operations.
---
My theory: The miner protestors that were fighting against AMS no doubt found some way to break into Mineshaft no. 9 and found what was down there. I think whatever caused that ultracite vein to form and grow is what transformed the mole-miners into what they are.
---
If there is a mole-miner city, I bet it's under the town of Welch.
---
Extra effects aren't set i think,  my pickaxe has reduced weight instead of speed
---
What I knew they gave back ammo but not ultracite!! Lol
---
Runs a grossly overpowered build, acts shocked when they melt a boss? It's his own fault.
---
They REALLY need to nerf these builds , some people will throw hissy fits and make drama posts blah blah, but its for the good of the health of the game.
---
So true, great game but what a Frankenstein
---
Not in the game currently less your an NPC it's part of an outfit from fo4.
---
They're gone, man. Nothing you can do. I'm assuming you were logged in during the reset. Don't do that anymore.
---
It happens, I shoot in grab and jump away. Seems to solve the problem
---
i have more than one in my stash, but i only carry one with me.
---
I'm interested. I'm waiting to see a gif of the emote before I decide, but I'm a sucker for sword &amp; sorcery themed stuff.
---
Ok gotchu.
---
Things are going to get rocky when new gen comes out.
---
Can I ask what's the benefit of nuking there over in front of the dropsite?
---
Magic weapons have nothing to do with the weapons themselves, it's a bug with legendary effects infrastructure.
---
Grelok Cackle emote in action, for those curious: [https://youtu.be/q42dOL1OZ8A](https://youtu.be/q42dOL1OZ8A)
---
Side note; isnt there a better map we could have instead of the "traveler" prewar map? I understand the pipboy we have is a model that doesnt have a digitally installed map
---
Wait I was certain the SBQ has more health depending on people present, are you sure?
---
aw man! with the new damage calculations it would take two minutes to do this :(
---
Yeah, same problem. I found dropped all notes and holo’s you’re not using helped a lot. As well as ammo. I think I read somewhere like... each individual item has its own loading time or something. I dunno. Try it though.
---
I'm now terrified to log on.  But I guess I'll risk it anyway.
---
Ok yeah that makes sense
---
Mones very laggy aswell, but has been that way for a while 
---
Also my score board has been very laggy as of late when i try to pan around.
---
Mine have auto completed 5 times since event started. You get used to it.
---
100% sure.
---
its supposed to work with all weapons but I have not tried it with all weapons.  just google ammo glitch on a youtube video.  you should have no problem finding it
---
It's great!  But click baity title is gonna get critiqued:
---
&gt;**Why haven't I heard anything about the Mistress of Mystery questline?**
---
 Because this sub's search feature was not utilized properly.  Lots of love for that questline dating back to the game's launch.
---
One great thing about being finished with the Run is that I don't have to worry about that shit anymore.
---
I’ve seen one where it traps you in a empty glitched underground room.
---
Had a trap camp drop me of a cliff once , he wasnt counting on the fall damage armor . When he came to claim my junk i followed him around laughing at him until he left the server . Good times
---
Next title: For those waiting to respawn at a Colossal Problem
---
Dont do it on private servers and don’t bother if people have Tesla’s. It’s a waste of time and ammo with those asshats causing everyone to blue screen pixelation and ridiculous fps
---
Where you playing during reset hours?
---
I think you tried to comment something, but I can't see it?  Idk.
---
Bone chimes work well too
---
Only if "Improved Repair Kit" were to work this way, and were not an Atom Shop item.
---
I tried using the weapon wheel while in event big mistake.
---
My dailies read 7/11 already completed and all of my weekly are done already. I hope they fix this lol, its the opposite of the event's point.
---
Fallout 1 had a Cyro story line? Since when?
---
It happens to me when i have to much stuff in the box. Mostly weapons and armor. When i transfer most of what i dont need to a mule it always solves the problem. I think you have too much stuff on you!
---
Pretty solid. Can't wait to see that at the Meat Cook.
---
K thanks
---
Will Share as soon as Danny has it available :)
---
Oh man, classic.
---
In the great words of Responder Miguel, “remember, camps are mobile”
---
At least I got some free curtains in the atom shop! 💀
---
Yes please! Have it collect med supplies!
---
no vertibird power armor
---
why even live
---
well that'll be part of the fun, finding out how to shave that well down!
---
i dont care about votes, i just want my question answered.  what surprises me is the amount of people that reply with anything but an answer.
---
In related news, it looks like they are doing the extra dailies now.
---
For those deciding what username to buy 3 separate bullets from?
---
Going to be a pass for me this week with the Grelok stuff. I guess weird a wacky atomic shop items appeal to some folks, considering how much Bethesda puts it into the shop.
---
Yep, is this known to cause the bug? I don't frequent the sub, only just learned of it so haven't seen anything. Level 55 so still a fairly fresh player in Fallout terms. I tried reseting my XBOX, made no difference.
---
I mean, true, but when you've got a great spot already...
---
Don't give up on the sword if you play a melee build. While it lacks the legendary effects, it ignores 100% of armor if you have the Eye of Ra equipped.
---
Will they be, possibly. Butt... some bugs been here since release apparently.
---
...or "For those turning the spit as if there is no tomorrow"... or "For those knee-deep in Challys feces right now".
---
1/20 *3 = 1.  Good to know.  In all seriousness I agree with you.
---
Holy fuck.  48 more days if I just do the main (Vital Equipment, Retirement Plan)
---
It doesn't matter. Those points are gone forever.
---
That weapon is gonna be common , my group of 8 pulled like 5 on one run. The cursed weapons seem to be repeats not randomized , the pick ax has been the same for everyone too
---
Thanks! I dig it. Totally will be picking up today. I am finishing the legendary run tonight also, so that’s double exciting.
---
Ya 11am don't be online. Some get the bug and some don't.
---
I'm nearly level 200 with a bloodied build minigun, it's not enough to carry.
---
I  think that is fair. But don't you have to be a general to launch a nuke?
---
waiting in anticipation for the deep cave hunter outfit to be released on the atomic shop is killing me
---
Same here. And I always play the game when the reset.
---
Ooferton
---
1000% never trade for anything from there play the game you will get it simple as that . Totally agree with your post
---
Because you put two entirely different things in the contents of your post. It's missleading.
---
Yeah, I noticed that! I'm going to build for pistol/sword, with a side of shotgun and grenades. More thematic than top-tier, I know, but should be fun.
---
It always makes me laugh that the powerful automatic seems more powerful than the highest hardened receiver on the handmade, yet each shot takes a minuscule amount from vats in comparison
---
That one is part of the outfit which was one entire piece back in fo4. It has been teased in other atom shop items but has yet to be released. There is an assault gas mask, which is the closest item in-game to look like it.
---
Is 21:9 still not working correctly?
---
I personally think it's super cool!
---
Just had the same issue, lost 10.5 k in S.C.O.R.E, you can send a ticket to Bethesda but they wont refund your points, just 'Pass your concern on to the development team' its SO annoying
---
Planetarium lights FTW!
---
I've just been thinking right I keep doing the queen for the power armour plans, after I do the new event and get the plans which are easier to get and the few rare items why would keep wasting ammo on this bullet sponge I've git no reason.
---
Nothing is known to cause the bug. But being online seems to be a widespread factor. It's possible to be online and not get hit, and it's possible to not be online and still get hit.
---
Instigating stealth builds are the way
---
I get to be an evil sorcerer? Yes please 😈
---
Still no armor displays.
---
Yeah this is a struggle. I love the thing but never use it. 
---
If they added 2mm EC to the Armco machine I might give it a go.
---
How can I submit a ticket on Xbox?
---
Well if you cant solo the queen then its on you .
---
I’m level 80 and my weapons don’t dent it so I stay away from scorch beast and colossal problem so the people who can hurt it and deserve the reward get it
---
So no Cave Hunter, even though a Colossal Problem is now out for everyone?
---
Major issue all over my Xbox fans seem to have a mind of their own now too up and down off and on.
---
From another post:
---
 **Earle**: 32k HP, 400 DR, 400 ER, 500 RR, Ignores 80% of all incoming damage, immune to radiation and explosions.
---
Kinda what I was expecting, actually. Especially since the Garb boosts stealth.
---
I like how it has RR and it’s also immune to radiation lol
---
Vendor hopping is like going to garage sales! You never know what treasures someone will have, or how much they'll sell it for
---
Man destiny had that shit figured out in 2014 and WoW way before that. It just seems to be lack of underfunding and understanding of the player base at all.
---
They can. Cursed Weapons dropping from Earle are the prime example. 
---
Of course, they are dogshit but that's not the point. :)
---
However, they won't do that. We've been complaining about the asinine loot system in this game since day 1 and what did they do?
---
Fuck all.
---
Really really resistant lol
---
You posted what I was thinking about this morning regarding the event!  
---
And I just did a currency conversion - you're being charged the equivalent of $16.50USD for Fallout 1st... That is daylight robbery. Absolute robbery. Maybe a petition of some sorts can have more of an impact than a Reddit post. I strongly urge you to do something because this is wrong, this is very wrong. Come on Bethesda, have some damn morals.
---
Heavy guns can cripple too.
---
you misunderstood, some of the devs who worked on F1 also did the story for the Outer Worlds
---
Never be on at reset hours, never play NW at reset hours never be at atomic shop before loggin in, only had auto complete once and was playing nuclear winter. This is an old bug... Been Here since nuclear winter lauch
---
Just a reminder - a ticket will accomplish nothing. Those points are gone and will not be awarded.
---
Damn when did they change how chems worked? I couldve sworn you could only have one active at any given time.
---
The fences certainly can be broken. I share my Mire camp location with a family of Radtoads (lvl 40 toads), and most times when I return to camp at least one of the fences is down. Fortunately they take virtually nothing to repair (just 1 steel if I recall correctly) 
---
Yes they snap together, and unlike other wooden fences they follow the terrain, so that you don't end up with the situation of fences on a slope where the top one is almost completely buried. They also snap at various angles, not just 90 degrees. I think it's 30 degree steps. Look good, not really "communist", just a splash of flaky red paint on the posts.
---
I took screenshots after it happened, it would be obvious to anyone looking at them that I couldn't possibly complete all those challenges in 5 minutes, but is it even worth putting in a support ticket to Bethesda? Have people had any success with this?
---
My b
---
I joined one last night and we didn’t do much at all and failed but I finally got to see him and I’m a sucker for lore so I was like *woaaahh 🥺😮*
---
Waste of bullets but worth it for the -WOW-
---
Just holding the right stick is enough.
---
I can guarantee you nothing will come of it. Try to log off before the reset, it could help.
---
They said they're working on that maybe around time instanced camp bunkers get released.
---
This!  I have Ace picking up whatever because I find his audio the least annoying, but I would  much rather he only be on my raider character's - my main still has a piece of responder gear at almost any given time.  That CAMP needs a responder bot.
---
I think you just Karmically blessed me. I just got a Quad Pump-Action. 32 rounds of instagibbing glory. Now, I keep the 8-shot bloodied for backup. Game is seriously telling me to go down the shotty tree.
---
Me two my stash boxes and my vending machines but I’ll try to get rid of all my holos and extra crap that sounds like it will work
---
interesting, from what i've experienced, on PC, it doesn't seem to like just pressing a movement key while spinning a spit.  but i have seen comments now saying it works when in photo mode, so i will experiment with that.
---
I really can’t stand trap camps. They trap noobs that loose all their junk. I never travel with much so they won’t get much from me. And if you want build an intricate maze that leads to treasure or death fine. But hiding in stealth to quickly remove the floor is sad and pathetic....
---
Kudos to you and your friends. You obviously put in serious time farming your equipment and you deserve it. Are you using Uny/Ap set? Or csa?
---
No it's not worth it. Bethesda has received hundreds of tickets about this at this point, I'm sure. Points are gone, and won't be awarded.
---
I always have one gun army on my hg power armor build. Armor pen, check. Cripple, check.
---
Just give everyone a chance to damage Earl.
---
I love the idea of the MOMs but the gear definitely doesn’t lv well , eventually you will end up in a Chinese stealth suit and that build will be compatible
---
Wait...there’s a chest you’re supposed to loot. Fuck lol
---
I built a rifeman around lvl 70 based on perk card packs and legendaries from another character.  Was one of three at lvl 86-87 to go against Earle.
---
So no animation of the Grelok emote?
---
That would be awesome. I make it a point to go to the cola vendor everyday in the white springs tho.
---
Most the legacy explosives arent getting hit nearly as hard
---
This applies to all legendary kills, if you can’t find them but know where they died give it a few minutes and they’ll reappear ..
---
I had a guy drop me a two shot fatman once. That was cool. Its my only two shot weapon
---
One reason why I play on Xbox now so I can pm people at least.  In game chat sucks and the audio aways  gets real quite after i start the game
---
Nice that you can reliably get screws somewhere, since the assaultron farming doesn’t work anymore.
---
yeah... my english grammar isnt the best, sorry.  
---
edit: nvm, im a dumbass, i just realised the problem.
---
50
---
[Here is how the experiment went](https://youtu.be/OLmQTIS9Rv4)
---
Definitely getting worse. It will soon hit the 'unplayable' level I'm afraid.
---
The steam player count for 76 is like 8,000 lol. There’s probably 100,000 people on all the platforms lol. The all time High this month was 11k.
---
No fix, points are gone.
---
fine, they get to keep the molerats, just give us some more boomsticks!
---
You have to move again and again and again. The budget will slowly shrink back down to normal. Your friend is gonna one you some caps for having to move your camp til it’s gone.
---
To be honest, you shouldn't trade anything for the mask. It's going to be one of those items that it just not wanted after a while. Like the White Wolf Fedora."Oh, I got *another* mask."
---
Nope.  That 'friend' is a jerk.
---
yeah
---
oof
---
Happening to a lot of people this morning, apparently. More than usual, at least.
---
I've clearly marked it as an edit but feel free to downvote if you feel I've wronged you somehow :)
---
So, we’re not getting out SCORE? Or does it eventually get counted towards it?
---
That atom count is strong
---
Well...you could submit a support ticket but then you'd be potentially getting a slap on the wrist, especially if you don't explain that it was your friend who blueprinted and placed those items in your camp.
---
As for your friend, consider finding a replacement.
---
Thanks man - Varying Uny/AP Sneak/Sent pieces :)
---
I totally forgot about meat week, damn. That happens when you don't play RN lol
---
Ah yes, let me kill him and the dozens of spawns with 3 bullets from my GAUSS MINIGUN.
---
Get smarter.
---
I hope the comment is not out of place, but have they fixed the bunker floating items bug? I really want that bundle...
---
I would feel more comfortable expressing my thoughts to them
---
I afk a lot due to having a lot of distractions. 
---
I often have to afk out in the wilderness, and just opening the pipboy and holding either stick in any direction on any screen is enough to keep from dc-ing.
---
I know that the legacy weapons are lower on the list of overpowered weapons, but when they're used in the ways I've seen, they're incredibly annoying. Sure maybe it's mostly in PvP where no matter how many perks you stack they still instantly shred you. But even in PvP I've seen people at events with the plasma gat just wipe waves of enemies in stuff like primal cuts and it just runs the fun of the hunt in that event since it's just sit at the drum and wait for buddy to kill everything at that point.
---
I'd be happy if these guns got balanced to be closer to normal guns but even then that doesn't address how almost all of them are duped. So they would need to add them back to the loot pool and tweak them just enough to not be worthless, which is something quite hard for them, and hope they somehow dont break them even more.
---
You've used the Future TEK camp skin. That's the cause. Remove it and that should solve it (might have to move your CAMP device as well).
---
Maybe when people stop making new accounts just to make posts to exaggerate this happening.
---
nope, gone forever.
---
I just had this issue on Xbox One. Was doing graham event and all dailies and weeklies expect for 2 on each auto completed. That is 12,500 score I’m losing out, which at rank 86 is 4 levels for me. It forces players to now pay when they can’t achieve rank 100 legitimately anymore. 
---
I submitted a ticket but the help page says they are “investigating” the issue. It says they wouldn’t be able to adjust the score or challenges. That is completely unacceptable. 
---
In my ticket I said that while they can not adjust me score I want the 600 atom equivalent to get to the appropriate rank. 
---
Has anyone been able to get assistance regarding the auto complete?
---
Yes it's better, but still a stupid focused grind on leveling that pushes you way too hard into staying in one build
---
Are you using the orange camp module skin from the legendary run? If so you need to unequip the skin in the atom shop and relocate and rebuild again.
---
I use both with adrenaline gun fu and reaper , yes I’m that jerk that one hits everything so fast I’ve been screamed at for cheating hacking and modding also people have done terrible things to my mom
---
Fair enough, just wanted to make sure you understood you are never getting those points back.
---
Nothing says "community" like shitting on low level players during the latest content drop. 👌
---
Your "friend" sounds like a grade A jackass for that. It's one thing if you want to mess up someone else's camp with that glitch, but to do it to other people is a new level of shitty.
---
I am thankful that people on pubic teams can't add things to camps.
---
Oh forgive me, I didn't mean to upset a mighty food build. I'm sorry to anger a hardcore 76 player. Please don't use your BE Gatplas on me
---
The rewards don't match the effort, have completed it 5 times used a shed tone of ammo and once I get all the plans and drops what's the point of keep grinding the event at least the Queen has chance to drop the sweet plans I still need, maybe the power armour plans should be added to loot pool.
---
It is entirely unacceptable that we have to trouble shot the issue ourselves. I just had the auto complete on for weekly and daily challenges while doing graham event. That’s 12,500 score I lost out on.
---
I'll give that a go, thanks
---
Edit: Just did it for around 2k caps worth and didn't move at all from 99% :/
---
They fixed the future tec camp skin to now appear on the map as intended, but it requires you to re-place your camp again.
---
The cursed weapons aren’t randomized , it’s the same shit everyone else is pulling
---
Try to get them to refund atoms for the equivalent ranks you would lose.
---
It happens to me sometimes too but last night for whatever reason I held dwn my O button (PS4 so far right option) and it released me.
---
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
---
I’d report my friend.
---
Sigh still waiting for them to re-release the starburst linoleum to complete my pre-war house
---
Next season probably. It’ll most likely be the tier 100 reward.
---
yeah, I don't blame you! with SCORE, A Colossal Problem and Meat Week going on it's a circus out there.
---
Open your eyes, look up to the sky and seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Same here im here for the plans and drops then im out. Got the mask and the plushie need the other then laters.
---
Improved repair kits were supposed to be an end game reward according to Bethesda themselves so it’s really stupid that A Colossal Problem doesn’t reward it already..
---
I went through Bethesda website!
---
So why not just wait until they have it where they want it instead of screwing over builds like rifleman and making gunslinger even worse?
---
Well I'd feel sorry for you, but all these dupers have ruined the game with them, I cant go two, three events without having someone pull one out for the most mundane of enemies and shred my frames while taking everything out of the activities challenge or purpose. or have someone clip through a wall at colossal problem and kill him before the event even starts with em.
---
PC? I may have been at that event with you, but didn't stick around afterwards.
---
the season rewards on the PTS, it isn't last i checked.
---
I mean this fits with the mechanist stuff from like way back in f3 . Its just a costume someone would steal out the holloween store
---
no argument here
---
Lmaooo and who do you insinuate me to be? this isn't one of my first posts in this sub but about this it is.
---
Is there any way to get the grognak emote by itself?
---
Huh. Weird. But cool I guess since people won’t have to grind for it.
---
It’s a good screw farm.
---
Some people are dicks no doubt. But, you really can't tell if the guys rushing to the creatures and killing them ASAP in Prime Cuts are those type of guys. There is a timer and timing out sucks.
---
It's likely because of the popularity on consoles. If this was a PC-only release, they probably would've had it at launch.  
---
I think the split PC/Console release for the recent patch is a good sign that they might be moving in this direction, where emphasis might be split. I could see there eventually being a text chat for PC.
---
Weapons and combat mechanics are -like all fallout/eso games made by Bethesda- all over the place. There are HUGE disparities between builds. And it seems to me that's what they want. It's not bad, but forces you to the same cookie-cutter meta builds everyone is playing.
---
If they decided to make the PA Heavy guys a slow moving tank, no-stealth-at-all, heavy constant damage bunch... the Auto guys a somewhat-stealthy, highest mobility, very few crits but constant damage bunch... and the Semi guys a very stealthy, very high critic-dependant damage build... It could all be balanced to produce very approximate final damage numbers over a long parse, but with very different playstyles. 
---
It can be balanced, but then it wouldn't be Fallout.
---
Best item I've dropped recently was TSE shotgun, followed by an AA ss +str Cultist Dagger.
---
If they're not giving SCORE, they're definitely not giving atoms, in my opinion.
---
I posted a message about this before. Look at my previous posts and you'll seeit. I got my fully modded ultracite power armor back after selling it to someone.
---
Cage armor with helmet, it seems to me it was called that on fo4.
---
After the last update that page turned into a mess.
---
There is a random encounter scene (you can google random encounter locations) in which a full set of raider power armor spawns. I believe that when you enter the armor, you hear a message playback about returning the power armor to someone. 
---
Are you talking about this?
---
Congratulations, you most likely have three illegal guns, blame the dupers.
---
Bone and glass need some tweaks too , they are basically useless
---
"only working build?" what does that mean?
---
Ammo scrap would be better for this event specifically tbh.
---
Thank you very much!
---
I liked the ending but haven't found this magically chest yet, on any of my runs I need more time to loot and get out please 🙏.
---
This just happened to me , all but 2 of my dailies and weekly have completed .. did it have anything to do with being In the game whilst it refreshed ? Super bummed , had been working hard on catching up recently
---
"We aren't planning on doing anything about it."
---
I feel the same way. Some death traps have killed me and I got a laugh from it but the completely hidden stacked Punji boards pissed me off. I believe BGS fixed that problem though.
---
I’ll have to take a look at notes and holos. That is the only thing I can think of that I have not managed. Part of the reason is each note coming out of stash pops up on my screen taking way too much time.
---
scroll down
---
Ebay.
---
No. We need to talk about those 15,000 atomic points. What the hell happened.
---
&gt;I need title ideas guys, give me your best.
---
Autumn is coming.
---
Those are coming in Season 2, according to the PTS.
---
The entitled people are the ones who think even if they’re level 20 every event should be for them, never mind the higher levels who have to carry them. Ya’ll are leech SBQ kills off us and it’s whatever because it doesn’t hurt anybody, but now you want to take a slot that is actually needed just so you can get your ass handed to you the entire time.
---
Not all of us high levels have optimized bloody builds or magic weapons, the event is hard for us too. We don’t need level 35’s burdening us by turning a team effort into “pls kill everything for me and earn rewards for me”
---
Kind of self explanatory. I guessing you’ll say they all work perfectly and it’s coincidence such a large portion of the players use it.
---
Had it on just in case to ill swap the perk out for something else .
---
Anyone found a good area off the ground where you can deal with the wendigos?  They are the best part of it but a real PITA
---
Finally someone who understands. I feel like most people here arent happy with the idea because they spent all their time trading for the things so they can break the game too. The guns are OP simple as that
---
Good point! I’m going to focus on notes. When I try to toss them from the stash they come up on the screen one at a time and it takes forever. Is there a trick to not mass move notes without reading everyone again?
---
I want the mask , but at the same time, so does everyone. And I hate wearing outfits that everyone else wears lol I always want to look different or in something uncommon to most wastelanders.
---
Agree with OP though. What people are asking for, for this mask is a little silly
---
Not sure yet, started RW side since the Firebreather's prayer is very closely worded to the Fireman's prayer.
---
If there isn't state-specific lore, I'll guess it's a combination of the Maltese Cross (common symbolic recognition of bravery) with a simple version of a badges scramble (a bundle of equipment, often four items=8 points= again the Maltese Cross that can contain various symbols with historic significance to the calling.)
---
Will edit after I've cross-checked Firebreather lore.
---
Yep, trying to catch up but all is lost
---
Thanks for letting me know you're incapable of reasonable discussion, don't have to waste my time!
---
That’s true.  From my personal experience, it’s also easy to stop trying certain things if they don’t work a few times. I had been on cruise control for so long with food buffs I stopped tinkering. I had so much meat from meat week I tried a few things with carnivore and saw the huge difference between two bloodied characters. 
---
A trap people fall into is being focused on a solution rather than a process, and that’s how stuff like what I found gets missed. I was too focused on just plowing through stuff instead of exploring what I could do with buffs.
---
I had my mind blown when he called high level people the entitled ones lol, like we aren’t the ones using all our supplies. Felt like I was going crazy
---
It would give a balance of balance back to the legendary pools and market. Most legacies you see now, are duped.
---
Everywhere!
---
Can’t wait for the vertibird power armor
---
well lucky you, I'm shafted as a rifleman because of... wasn't it PvP balance?
---
Any idea what npc has highest armor? I’m guessing robots?
---
Key words being "from another player" there's no way of knowing whether or not a 70 has a good build as a second character or has never played before that character
---
They definitely do, and a lot of it from the few I really looked at. Using a shotgun, 2-3 shots awarded me 26 shells on one body. I don't know what the average was, but that's pretty good.
---
I didn't notice when I was using a heavy gun, but I missed looting some as well.
---
I disagree, bloodied is my main, but my alt is a junkies and it's very viable, I actually  run it more right now the survivability and the damage is very competitive
---
I can see your post history
---
That's why I looked again - the event said six players were in it
---
Interesting but a lot of legendaries get killed so fast they don't mutate.  This wouldn't do anything for players that are completely overpowering the mob but will make players having a tough time have an even tougher one.
---
Hm, this is really off-putting. I've been ignoring all the bugs this game has thrown at me, I just recently got into it and really love what it does at it's core, but a whole week or hindered progress on The Legendary Run which now means I more than likely won't finish it, and it's known information that Bethesda won't do anything about that? Bullshit, honestly. Anyways, enough of me moaning.
---
I really wish it was more Fallout &amp; not Fortnite.
---
I have mine on display in one of those museum-style, glass-on-wood display cases
---
I think people are finally understanding their builds aren’t that great, half their cards are used for weight management and they can’t comprehend how I can finish this event with 5-8 plasma cores. 
---
It’s because quality of life perks are a crutch.
---
Yeah I sort of shut down your arguments with that
---
I like beating the traps then leaving a "you've been insulted" note for the camp owner. I appreciate some of the creativity put into some of the traps and get a laugh from it some times so I hope the camp owner appreciates me beating their trap and poking fun at them and get a laugh too.
---
Damn! I thought it’s fucking rare and I traded it for my 2 legacies
---
This fucken mook.  Nice Job Sele. Keep up the good work!
---
Same....
---
[https://gifyu.com/image/cJva](https://gifyu.com/image/cJva)
---
9 out of 11 of both my weekly and daily challenges done and gone.  still can’t believe such a major bug hasn’t been fixed.....and that they won’t compensate you for their own screw ups.
---
NOOOO! Its a permanent drop. don't do that again.  you're only hurting yourself
---
I really wish single shot rifles and/or hardened receivers got a significant damage buff.  They’ll really need it after patch 22.  As it stands in the PTS, everyone playing a rifleman has to swap to commando in order to remain viable in areas like the Mire and Bog.
---
I definitely get sneak bonus on the queen while I'm in caution, and others are running around. I get the sneak multiplier message, the on screen damage numbers match, and in sneak I can visibly see the queen's health go down in sneak, but not while seen.
---
Junkie is decent but still a ways behind on damage compared to bloodied . God knows nocturnal is hurting bad
---
I'm lv70. I have a set of ultracite armor. A gauss rifle and a gatling laser. And lots of cores. Something like 30 super stims..how unprepared for the collossus am i
---
I have the 4 slot rectangle one
---
The fact that no more atoms are available really pisses me off. And I have over 30k....
---
Idk if you want all of them.... they are best used for amplify specific builds. 
---
I think most builds do well with marsupial, speed demon, healing factor, and now with the public teams, herd mentality.
---
That song is etched into my brain forever.
---
Are u full in stash space or camp budget?
---
Or even some more than two random flux. Hell I used 20 Ultracite plasma cores
---
Much like Encrypted, it's best to get a sense of your server before you start the event. 
---
You know, unless you're a super build with perfect equipment that can solo it if needed.
---
Doing this event on private servers is a nightmare , most of the people screaming about FPS and pixelation are on privates
---
Skins can't effect stats usually
---
I have 4 on display and balls written underneath and I carry around another two being I have to empty stash to fit it in. If your Stash is full you can’t display it
---
Berzerker legendary effect doesn't work in PA either.
---
Another player concerned with others ply styles. What is the obsession with bloodied builds. If u can’t run low health go full health junkies. It’s not hard
---
How do I raise a ticket ?
---
76 does not have to comply to the CVAA regulations as it was releases before the ruling for video games kicked in. If they make any changes to the chat system now, then they are required to comply.
---
They are piggybacking off Steam, Xbox, and Ps4 chat systems right now. They are looking into a chat system down the road but my guess is it will be closer to what Battle.net does, where the chat system is based on the browser rather than the game.
---
It's an easy way to get low defense for Berzerker legendary effect.
---
I mean, it ain't no junkies, but it has style.
---
I know it won't go in even with 10 pounds left
---
DoT effects are the worst. I run bloodied T65 and those are what kill me most of the time.
---
I just need reputation with the factions and I'm the same!
---
15k+ atoms?
---
Bro, u should spend ur money on more healthy hobbies, like coke or crack.
---
I just have an issue with the invisible punji boards that you can’t see sticking out of walls in narrow hallways. You shouldn’t be able to be killed by something that isn’t on the screen. 
---
But I have started growing an appreciation towards well thought out trap camps. It is a wasteland after all
---
Another my friend put ammunition extractor in my base post.   Lol.
---
No it’s not, point is I can’t stand having only two or three effective. build options.  Not everyone wants the same character build . Might as well play call of duty or some shit
---
nope, rank 100 is the "armor ace" power armor.
---
Yeh I thought that new skin for the handmade was a new weapon, based off the assault rifle from fallout 3... Annoyed a little when I realised it was a skin. I saw it in a data mined post.
---
Don't see why they can't add more guns, a new rifle etc.
---
Can you do a video preview of the staff as well? Would be very interested to see that. /u/Huxide
---
My one post? It's been my only major issue I've had with the game quit trying to suckle tod Howard's teet.
---
Ok. Off u go. Bye.
---
What’s that look like?
---
It will look good in my display case - other than that, I have no problem playing the event &amp; just having it drop naturally.
---
You don't understand I want ALL OF THEM
---
I have the same problem and if I deselect future camp I still have that camp.
---
No I got rid of some stuff just to make sure but no
---
... they were never working on a mobile port. Why the hell would they?
---
OP build?  Yes.  Only working build? No.
---
We need a sheepquatch weapon skins.  Too bad its not covered.
---
Ok now that’s at least accurate
---
Idk man, one of the few downsides of the rifleman build.
---
Same brother... same...
---
That’s weird. Put I use the case with the glass and hit assign. I had 4 on display before this event as I fought the one in the grove 6 times but twice I scrapped it. But I figured might as well display them. Now I was thinking if I get more I will have a room full of ball displays. Lol but then I need a lot of room in stash and I hoard 800 in it at all times and I use fallout first so I don’t have junk in it.
---
I mean.... you're exploiting something given to you but overall you are just protecting yourself. You aren't doing any malicious except standing under a protected area. Bethesda could remove the canopy and the Colossus could move in and attack in the future. It's not like duping or hacking in guns; everything I did is 'part' of the game per se.
---
i didnt buy the staff. only wanted the emote, and gladly it's not a bundle exclusive
---
I like how “ my friend did it “ has become the universal excuse for people who know damn well they are qued up for a ban. 
---
Even with a group of friends you should be in event teams. No worries about your camp and an added whatever team bonus you go with
---
Love the event, the execution is meh and the rewards NEED to be upped, they are not really worth if all you really get are some plans for you camp.
---
Rofl it’s in the room to the left when you are just about to exit the mine. A door opens that is closed when you enter
---
It might be harsh but why revive low levels?  If their level is beneath the wendigo spawns they likely arent contributing much.
---
That’s just mean
---
I never thought I would have SO MANY SCREWS!
---
Will do even better when legendary perks come out.  40% damage bonus from Taking One For The Team and Retribution will boost your own damage too.
---
Oh god please no invisibility. If I cant VATs something I dont wanna fight it.
---
Just curious, how did you know 7 other people were all playing in different instances at the same time?
---
haha cheers dude
---
Yeah I'm getting this
---
I've never seen a maze camp. That sounds fun.
---
yes its 250!
---
PvE games do that too, die as a DPS during an MMO boss fight and sometimes you're stayin dead cause it's safer/faster than trying to walk back.  Granted you get to see the action, staring at a respawn screen is wack.
---
Happened to me a few times , must be a built in mechanism for when the game is overloading the console, is crazy tho 😅
---
Might pick up the grelock costume for the hood
---
No issues for me yesterday.... just played again right now and it went smooth. Thank goodness.
---
1 handed weapons are pretty much garbage too
---
But.. I never buy atoms...
---
Yes because twice... TWICE!! I had people's camps despawn underneath me when i was trying to communicate to them that I wanted to trade because they had a fixer in their vendor I wanted to buy but was short on caps. I have other good legendaries but was just a few hundred caps shy of their asking price.
---
I was just left standing alone on the cold, hard ground wanting to cry
---
It’s not for me personally, but I can imagine some people could make a very cool looking camp with that for sure
---
nope I beat her story, I even have reward in steam I tried multiply times the result is: nothing, when I scrap her station it shows up that quest is failed which is weird because she did’t give me a shit she only delivers her 4-5 repetitive lines and that’s all
---
Id like to add for those players just about to do this - don’t be a tool and do nothing the entire time please. I did three events yesterday. Event 1) I died at the end and the mine collapsed. I wasn’t able to loot boss (I think you can loot???) because no one would leave their hiding spots to revive me. Completed but only mission complete loot, no boss. Event 2) three players found hiding spots and didn’t move at all in the event. They wouldn’t even revive fallen players actually trying to do the event. Time expired. Event 3) same as two with three players hiding. I kept dying, hoping for revives but nothing. Those three wouldn’t help me or the others. They just stayed where they were with their chameleon self playing it safe. Event ended and we failed.
---
All I ask is if at the very least just pop up from your hidey holes to at least revive the people actually doing damage.
---
If you read my post it says I got the bug when I was logged off
---
This exact thing happened to me today. All but 2 on weekly and all but 3 on daily. I submitted a ticket because FUCK that, I’m so close to finishing this event and needed that to do it. Then I’m not logging back in for a while.
---
“Atom Shop update for those social distancing from Fallout 76”
---
Not lazy, it's an absolute requirement for game balance reasons. In the game's current state, any content they release has two options:  
---
1) Release a bunch of enemies that all the endgame players will kill in one hit but casual players can participate too
---
2) Release a bunch of bullet sponges that only bloodied builds can kill effectively, rendering the new content NOT FUN for casual players  
---
The game balance is completely, absolutely FUCKED right now, and IMO this is a more important change than fixing some bugs
---
Why though? How is that important?
---
&gt; 76 does not have to comply to the CVAA regulations as it was releases before the ruling for video games kicked in
---
I'm not sure:
---
&gt;  However, all games released on or after January 1, 2019, and all games released prior to that date that undergo future “substantial upgrades,” must comply with the ACS accessibility requirements.
---
Fallout76 is constantly receiving content update (upgrades) and I'd argue that Wastelanders + Steam release both fall under "substantial upgrades".
---
It's indeed arguable though.
---
They also need to fix the event, I didn't get "Event completed" after beating it, so no reward at all, not even treasury notes....
---
Sounds like you're the one with terrible trigger discipline
---
I have never been able to complete this event. This should not be scientifically possible. Bravo.
---
OK cool everyone seems to be forgetting I legit just said I was a new player so I thought this was an event, not a raid. Thanks to those of you down voting me for asking a question, glad to see how nice this community is 👍🏻
---
Yeah. I have got it when logged off too. Being logged off is still the best advice there is to give.
---
sounds really funny
---
Same exact thing. I submitted a ticket, but I’m not holding my breath. I think I’m the same level as you too, this would have probably done it for me.
---
Go buy some plans. Modus has some really expensive plans.
---
The upcoming damage nerf will help fix that hopefully.
---
Anyone got a video or gif of the Grelok throne when sitting on it? Didn't know if the animation is the same as the grognak throne just with the staff instead of axe
---
Sell stuff to the robot vendor. I know the daily limit is 1400 caps but it's still something and since meat week is here you can sell excess cooked food. That's the important part, cooked food equals more caps. I also sell Grenades mainly because I don't use them. Chems also works too. Any excess radx and radaway works, radx suppresses your mutations but I would definitely keep 10 or so just to be safe. As for player vending, any legendary items you run by, sell them at a decent price. Don't sell them for an outrageous amount of caps or no one will buy them. Plans are also good money makers, people always buy plans they don't own however don't sell them at base price because if you sell a stimpak plan for 350 caps I can almost assure you I can find someone else selling it for a much lower price.
---
Misc is always the issue , go find all the bs that’s just sitting and dump it , plans and maps are also bad for this too
---
So it's Mystic Dawn Week.
---
So apparently it takes up 5 pounds and can only go in a certain case
---
If you click the Public Event, it shows how many participants and how long ago it started
---
You mean a "level threshold" and not a cap but I follow. I'm level 79, which for someone playing since Beta is very low and I tend to just stay clear of these events when they are new/fresh so I don't piss anyone off. I don't want to under perform and be a drag on anyone, even in video game life.
---
I have run out of advice on this issue. I used to avoid being on during the transition to the next days challenges. However, I have finished the race and started doing the meat week event during both same transition. Have not yet been able to reproduce this issue by staying on during that time.
---
Its the difference between an instance vs open world encounter i think.
---
I’ve seen this mentioned a lot recently and did it myself and it worked after 9 moves. It’s not consistent and doesn’t work for everyone it seems.  Hopefully they just patch it out at some point but for now you’re probably SOL.
---
Dang, now I wish I hadn't spent so much of my freetoms.
---
They need a salt emote.
---
Same here, too... and everyone I've talked to.
---
Lol it’s ugly , I’m not taking my beard off for that trash
---
People would go for it! Someone tried to buy the dress *I was wearing* a few days ago. Like, go find your own dead lady to rob, fam. Then you too can be a superhero. I'd rebuild a whole camp with that theme if they introduced related items.
---
I dont know about that , my point os the only way to avoud randoms is with private servers. Crying about it and bashing the lower levels for attempting it is well , old already
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.

Yeah it’s a pain in the ass, I find myself going to vendors in whitespring and just buying things I’m not really bothered about just so I can keep selling gear and making more caps
---
This is what mine looks like. Was hoping to complete legendary run this week...  [https://imgur.com/a/tw8XpG1](https://imgur.com/a/tw8XpG1)
---
all mine were good, i don't login until 12:15.
---
don't be logged in 10 mins prior and wait 15 after.
---
ever since ive done that i haven't been hit with it
---
I made it to rank 96 without having this happen, but today I got hit as well. 
---
All dailies except NW and all weeklies except the repeatable one. 12K+ SCORE lost.
---
It also lost one of my radio tubes for the raider daily to top it off.
---
90% of the stuff they put in the atom shop I really wish were parts of locations in game, I’m pumped when some of them are. Sure it’s cool to go to someone’s camp that’s a diner, but it’s so far and few between. Imagine if that Slocum’s Joe by the Wayward was an actual Slocum Joe that sold coffee and doughnuts. I would really like to see another Canterbury Commons situation with an NPC acting like Grognak and a ghoul like the Wizard
---
My partner made a OoM themed camp.
---
I would say the reason Wastelanders and Steam happened at the same time was probably so they can say that players have a chat option available through the Steam overlay.
---
That could also explain why they pushed Steam so hard. Then they can tell the FCC that chat was available but we chose not to use it when we did not convert to Steam.
---
I hung mine on the crafting campfire
---
Xbox is windows so i guess youre console was overheating... but im only guessing. I play on ps4 and i only got 1 CE error aka. Bluescreen
---
Maybe it’s your internet? I’m on PS4 as well and have had frame rate issues. Only issue I had, was earl disappearing through the floor. That happened once. So far.
---
I got a Bloodied 25FFR Gatling Plasma from Raider Punks daily couple days ago, pleasantly surprised
---
That and China’s version of Mount Rushmore
---
no, you have to pay for it.
---
Only used my ultracite on the boss so I didn't know if it could drop either.  Good to know.
---
Watching Earle's powerpoint presentation
---
I would like to see a tattered curtains set
---
This week was by far the worst for me. This is what was autocompleted  [https://imgur.com/a/tw8XpG1](https://imgur.com/a/tw8XpG1)
---
Yes I love to go shopping who doesn’t but sometimes I just have to tell the player selling an awesome item cheap that you can get way more for it I like to help people in the game if I can but if that player is a jagweed I’m just buying and laughing
---
Same here. I'm mostly mad about the weeklies. I've submitted a ticket, is there anything else we can do? I just want the opportunity to do these challenges, not free score.
---
"I've been told that when legendary perks come out that all duplicate cards you currently have will poof into nothingness."
---
That is happening now on live game, and that is why you should not open perk card packs yet. In some scenarios you will lose perk cards if you open them now. In PTS you can safely open your perk card packs as they do not "go poof" anymore. That is also why high level players will miss out on many perk cards as they have lost many of them over the months. People are asking changes and improvements on this and hopefully bethesda does something about it. It's PTS, anything can still happen.
---
Lots of good suggestions here.
---
Bullets and junk fly out of player vendors if priced fairly.   Generally 1 cap per bullet and basic junk.  Better junk like ballistic fiber goes for more.
---
I wish a lot of ESO was used for 76, could be so much bigger and better. And an engine that can actually handle new content.
---
Nah, 8 is more than enough. Performance is a big problem and 2 more players would make 1fps even worse to suffer through. Explosive weapons really degrade the experience for everyone.
---
Well I’m not a duper.
---
Can anyone explain to me why Bethesda isn't able to implement text chat, which has been in MMOs since the beginning, if a mod is able to implement it? I know the game engine sucks, but if an outside mod can work, how is it possible that Beth can't do it?
---
I’m actually a low level and I disagree. It’s Endgame content. Sure I want to play it but I understand I need to be at endgame and maybe even then some to reliably play it.  I know it isn’t level gated but from everything I see around it. It’s endgame content. There’s plenty of other stuff us noobs should get done before we think about doing it.
---
On Xbox one x and it ran super smooth for me. My only gripe with the event is there is no indication as to where to go for the escape. If there is a marker then it doesn’t show for me. Thankfully on my first run another player spammed the follow emote and I was able to find my way out.
---
Check the events on Bethesdas website, they stopped it only because of the Colossus and meat week. Should resume soon though.
---
What level should this be capped to if it were to be capped? Cause I'm almost level 75 and I feel like I do a decent amount of damage to help.
---
Its a problem but not a bad problem to have compared with some.
---
Just happened to me for the first time as well. With the increasing score requirements on the last 10 steps of the legendary run, one would think they would offer a remedy by now.
---
I... Didn't post that I commented on a thread with CCP shills if that's what your saying?
---
Yep. And Bethesda’s response is weak. Says they can not change anything related to the Legendary Run. I asked for Atoms to purchase my tiers that I’ll be missing out on. But that’s a long shot sadly. Was really looking forward to knocking out the challenges this week.
---
This.  A colossal problem is welcome, but should have been an early content patch for Wastelanders and/or part of a quest or series of raids/battles leading up to Earl.   
---
Score and brotherhood content could have waited til next year if they instead focused on fleshing out Wastelanders content and settler/raider quests.  There are still only 4 repeatable reputation dailies.
---
I dont think the problem is really bloodied, its 2x sneak builds what make damage too op, even a non bloodied non junkies build puts out insane damage in crits.
---
Holy cow that's the exact same for me. Well may we have brotherhood in disappointment.
---
It's never happened to me before today. I honestly never worried about it because I never considered it happening on the weekly update. I was really excited for this week's challenges because I'll finally finish the run. Uhg.
---
I came in yesterday to find all my challenges autocompleted. It sucked.
---
I understand what you're saying. But damage reduction isn't a balance issue. You would need to buff damage on other builds as well. If casual players have a hard time now. Imagine when enemies become even tougher to take down.
---
Well said. Asking for things to be taken away from other players is a slippery slope, IMO. Today Beth goes after something I hate, tomorrow Beth might go after something in my inventory. My guess is many of these gun ban posts come from being on the losing side of PvP, as we get weekly laments on this sub. From what I’ve seen of this game (playing since shortly after launch), there are veteran players who are really smart about perks, gear, and chem/food buff effects. Labeling things as magic and overpowered is just a quick and lazy label slapped on a more complex game balancing issues.
---
I've heard mixed things on them responding to those tickets. It's a real shame and more annoying since you can pay your way through, it's like they just want us to do that.
---
Yes sorry I forgot to mention that.
---
They're never going back to giving us atoms like that again. It sucks, but they obviously need to turn a profit on the game. I do however wish they'd give us something.. Scrip, gold... Even just caps would be nice .
---
those whales really gonna debate this tho
---
I am starting to use your post to get a bearing on what day of the week it is.
---
If you've completed the run you might just enjoy your well deserved break from doing pointless things every day. 🤗
---
Alrighty. 
---
Is there any word if this is intentional behavior and can be expected when PTS goes live? 
---
Cause it's really annoying to have to hit no everytime I want to swap perks.
---
Followup question.
---
On my 160. Depending on if I'm in 2h mode or heavy guns mode, I swap some cards for duplicates. Like in 2hander mode I use a 3* first aid, but only a 2* in heavy guns mode.
---
So no 1* there, but is it just gonna eat one randomly?
---
Made this last night just to document how much is lost with marginal weapons that are viable now but will be garbage with the nerf.  Sorry for the quality, I don't normally create videos from games.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q\_rKOuy9R98](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_rKOuy9R98)
---
I learned the first one I got immediately, then got four more.
---
It's just RNG.
---
I’m so dumb
---
My thoughts are also if you use all your stims and ammo in the fight its not really for you either. If you dont have the grind down for producing near limitless stims and ammo then maybe its not for you either.
---
Yep broken I died right after Earle and was spawned outside. 1000's of bullets wasted and no reward.
---
If your teammate or a friend is in the event, fast travel onto him. You will spawn in the event
---
There should just be a junk category in the build menu that lets you place any junk item as a floor/table decoration.  All they need to do is create the records.  I've done it in FO4.
---
Switch to an automatic and fill the air with lead, you’ll be bound to hit something eventually. But seriously I feel like if you pop some berry mentats you should be able to vats invisible mobs.
---
Yes, as I said in a prior post, carryover of extra SCORE would be appreciated, and on the low end of what could be awarded. 
---
It probably won’t happen for this season, but perhaps for next season end.
---
Y'all need to take some initiative for the health of the game, god damn.
---
This is very interesting indeed.
---
I couldn’t find any comments on fallout threads going back 43 days ago to when you posted on MillitaryPorn.
---
It’s like this is your only post on the subject.
---
And it’s amazing how every day, right after the rest there’s so many posts from people with this be
---
I guess their first post in this forum. Few comments elsewhere. And often they are relatively new accounts.
---
Starts back up the 27th with wood.
---
27-31 150m wood
---
31-03 200m cloth 
---
03-07 175m leather
---
07-10 250m glass
---
The last two are the important ones with the rewards being 50% purveyor sale and second helping of meat week.
---
Many of us have been saying this for months.
---
I'm just a poor vault-boy, I need no sympathy
---
Every single day I see these posts one after another. Log out before reset and log in 15 minutes after. Never had a
---
Problem until level 99 when I stayed on for the only time when it reset. And I got the bug.
---
Actually interested in that Grelok throne, but it just doesn't fit with my character, and I'm not craving it or anything.  Still looks kind of cool.
---
Free flower curtains are welcome though, as a new player here.
---
I had a guy with a trap base trap me and another guy in his death room. Then, he got on his mic and started talking to us like a villain from a James Bond movie or something. Started saying how we would die and started doing an evil laugh while he turned on his radiation emitters and flamethrowers. I made it out without dying, which impressed him so much he gave me a few scrip legendaries.
---
I can't solo SB Queen, WC or Earle. Other than that, nothing.
---
[Project Bravo](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events) starts up on 8/27.
---
Weird, it worked for me so far. Maybe someone else joined and the instance was full.
---
mixed things meaning what? AFAIK no one has ever been awarded lost points.
---
Yeah. ‘Friend’ lol. Keep on moving to fix your ‘friends’ mistake
---
Thankfully I never had that problem all three times I played yesterday. Only thing happened was last event I died right when he had a little bit of health left and when I came back from respawn timer he died. So the cave caved in and I couldn’t loot his body. Even tho all the stuff I did loot from him was junk. But first two times I looted him I died and couldn’t loot last chest. The last time I could. Nothing good but caps and junk. But once I left to go back to Appalachia I had a black screen loading bug. I was made and let it sit for ten minutes being that was the hardest fight. I closed the game down and somehow when I got back in I had all the loot which was the best. Cursed harpoon and a furious 40% +1 agility sledgehammer
---
While I did not play on private servers at the time I did the entire game by myself.  The only thing that you will have a hard time with is killing the SBQ unless you have specific builds/weapons/buffs.
---
Other than that I did the whole main quest and all of Wastelanders by myself.  
---
Some of the random events may be difficult solo but over all you will not miss much.
---
Nope, it was an unnamed power armor chassis with a full set of Raider power armor on it. I seem to have the answer to why I’ve been getting random suits of Raider PA, it seems like when someone completes Rose’s quests everyone in the server gets one.
---
It can also go on the Thanksgiving display.
---
I could see that, they already butchered the story line with wastelanders for new players...  
---
why are you just now emerging from the vault after it opened a year ago  
---
the robots inside make snide references to listening to the same messages over the PA system for the last year  
---
there isn't any real consistency to the narrative playing through... you do all the actions as if you were fresh out of the vault but all the story elements have been updated with current event references... my head hurt doing a fresh new character and bumping into old and new content that was all askew....   
---
at this point... revert the exit story to what it was pre wasterlanders and remove all the snide references, make the inside 76 references still be fresh launch day...   
---
once you finish up in there, new cut scenes...  
---
you left the vault, something happened, you didn't meet up with the overseer as planned... things kept going sideways, an explosion, knocked unconscious... a medbot, coma, time passes, robot tends you, you awaken to a new day, say goodbye to robot, start playing character with current affairs all on the current timestamp
---
just an idea
---
Lots of people have posted about this. 
---
Not sure why, as there is no reason to think it will ever happen.
---
I have earned those guns legitimately, who's to say they are duped (very high chance), I can't be punished for that and the guns are not illegal they are legacy...
---
This is my biggest fear upon entry lol.
---
Between the falling debris, acid and wendigos that stagger you the whole match is like a DOT deathmatch.
---
I would be fine with this if I didn't have to do 95% of the damage to the boss. Also there really hasn't ever been consequences to dying in any of the other fallout and elder scrolls games not sure why that would change now
---
They’re probably going for flux.  I always scrap as often as I can before hopping to player vendors...
---
Welcome to the wastelands.
---
I heard about it a couple times, no idea about the accuracy. But the vast majority of what I've seen is that no one is rewarded anything. So I've come to believe that they never will award anything.
---
Sometimes they just don't respond.
---
Even though it says 1.25 lbs so apparently the pip-boy is wrong or the stuff inside the sac is not counted in the total weight
---
INT only gives you more Condition when Crafting and more materials back when Scrapping.
---
The issue though is that unlike the Xbox One and PS4 version, our account name within the game is unrelated to our steam account, but instead our Bethesda account.
---
Which means that even if Steam *does* offer some sort of direct messaging and friend chats, it's impossible to communicate with PC FO76 players you meet in-game unless you're given their steam account.
---
He took your junk.
---
The problem is that they're damn near fucking everywhere. "When everyone's super, no one is" and on top of that, it wreaks havoc on what little balance there is in the game.
---
Mine always says 5 lbs you prob have a perk card for junk or armor pieces for junk
---
I can’t solo scorch beast queen or high level scorch beasts yet, but other than that the game is beatable pretty easily solo
---
This is how it should work. Would make life so much easier for those of us who can't be on daily.
---
Everytime you see a workbench get in the habit of scrapping all junk to lighten your load. And then when you see a stashbox (found in camps, train stations, red rockets) stash all your junk. Scrap then stash. Constantly.
---
I think it might be a community moderation issue, not a technical one. I doubt they have the resources or willpower to manage text chat, abuse and moderation.
---
you cant get it back unless he gives it back. if you want i can probably craft the guns you wanted (for free of course)
---
My account is a year old you poor troglodyte quit trying to gatekeep my issues with this game you odd basket case.
---
Can anyone remember what the last FO1st item was? Was it the Bog outfit? And how long ago was that?
---
Whelp I get a facepalm I forgot I had pack rat
---
Do you mean part 2 of Atlas? or the BOS expansion?
---
i learned about the second part of it
---
Another problem is that no one goes to do the fight. I went 5 different times on different servers and I was the only one there. Everyone else is off doing meat week. Which let me add to that. Primal cuts....... Always fails. Every single time no matter how many people are there. So what gives with that too?
---
That is why if there are a ton of folks I stop trying and just travel to something nearby and run.  It takes less time.
---
Having your account name as your display name actually bugs the shit out of me. I feel sorry for the guys that used their E-mail as their account names.
---
what effects make it magic?
---
&gt;  As a bonus i think he ~~got the respawn glitch~~ *logged off in shame* as he never came back.
---
I have been blessed to never have this happen no matter what. When I was doing the pass I made sure to always be off ten minutes before and was good and even now that I have completed pass and not worried about the score I play all the way through reset and never got it. I feel really bad for everyone that has had this happen. Sorry
---
My ultracite has a headlamp?  Swear I got a plan for it
---
It is intentional to save us the trouble of browsing through 20 same perks to get to the next. The new scrap perk cards thing is just not very well planned and hopefully they will do some rework on it. Because right now high levels are being punished for being high levels. It's PTS so everthing can and will change.
---
On your follow up.. I don't understand what you mean (english is my 3rd language).
---
EDIT: ah now i think i got what you are talking about, i'm not familiar with what is and is not deleted when opening the packs as i have never bothered to find out. Angryturtle has some videos about it.
---
I did that, but nothing?
---
Everyone has, AFAIK.
---
Same here
---
It will end at a specific time on the 26th. Normally when SCORE challenges reset, or an hour before.
---
Any type of laser gun that makes ash piles shouldn't be used. Ash piles are messed up and they MURDER frame rates.
---
Again, PvP isn't balanced with normal non-lagacy weapons at its basically a who shoots first contest.
---
In primal cuts the only enemy worth not killing asap are legendaries and if players keep killing them too fast maybe go to another server, it's what I would do. If your trying to get hits in for loot/exp try a tesla rifle for tagging.
---
Lastly, maybe PC dupping was way bigger on PC, maybe your just bothered by the fact you don't have one, it's hard to tell but if Bethesda wanted to fix legacy by mass removal they likely would have done so by now.
---
Encryptid too.
---
Flamer has extremely high damage and rate of fire. What were you using and wearing?
---
Get a pc and you can run it above 90fps on 2k resolution.
---
Just to give an idea the difference in damage with a stealth sniper (instigating crossbow) live vs. PTS (Adrenaline is clearly seen working in both, but the end results are quite different).
---

---
Block and server hop. Take away their fun and you win: keep playing their game and they win.
---
I have to say I’ve tried to be a bit more understanding and give the benefit of the doubt sometimes after I ended up totally accidentally melting a legendary at Guided Meditation. I wasn’t paying total attention because I was nearly out of ammo and was trying to find another weapon, when I got swarmed and just instinctively one shotting to get away. Oops. Saw too late one of them was a legendary. Felt bad. There’s always such a great vibe when everyone works as a team and walks away with legendary loot, so it felt crappy to appear like a jerk. Yet another reason why TEXT CHAT would be helpful.
---
I get sneak damage on Earl and the queen in stealth rifle. I also manage to be in either area with status indicating I'm not being detected. 
---
Wearing stealth suit for both. For Queen tucking up against a building seems to make me disappear. For Earl there's a long mine shaft separated from the main battle area, I stand in either end he's near and shoot the heads with a Two shot railway or TSE black powder.
---
The queen pops up the sneak message when she flies over, I just shoot the head with lever action couple times.
---
Sometimes there's too much going on with Earl for me to watch for the sneak damage message but when I see a headshot do 150+ damage it's gotta be getting something extra.
---
1. Bloodied stealth commando is the only build good for this boss imo
---
2. If 8 players join the event before you do another instance will open up where another 8 players will fight the boss
---
3. if you already have a god tier legendary set then power armor is useless, hell it is just useless no matter what
---
4. Magic weapons work the best so use that or stick to your b2525 fixer or handmade, mine shreds the boss but i have yet to try him with my b2525 fixer
---
5. Do it an open lobby first imo so you can feel just how useless people that don't run bloodied are /s that was a bit mean but still if somebody is doing this event without and optimized build they aren't really helping or hurting except for picking you up if you go down
---
Honestly the scrip would work wonders like that, caps and bullion wouldn't work in that model though.
---
&gt;38% Upvoted
---
Well somehow many don't think so, no idea what this kind of players want...
---
Since it's supposed to be a full week, it should end at the reset on the 27th. But all of the info says the 26th. That isn't a week, that is meat many days. And like Grahm says, those are bad words.
---
So what? You’re still bogus. I don’t have to prove it for you to know it’s true.
---
You dishonest person.
---
Sounds like the Treasure Hunter event will be way more fun this time around.
---
Always store your junk, expect to be killed at a workshop, so don't carry junk. What he means is when you take a workshop, first your do is craft a stash box and store your junk if you have any. Scrap it and then store it to save space. Regardless if he stole or not, the game would have taken it eventually, you would have gotten killed somewhere and the server would crash and you would lose it all. Best is either to accept losing it at some point or store it. Workshops are pvp zones, so watch your back.
---
What level are you ?
---
Wait do you mean running a melee build in power armor??
---
Same with me... That's pretty sad because Meat Week is a lot of fun and it made to login for the the daily challenges less of a burden
---
It doesn't affect the balance, legacies are shite in comparison to b2525 fixers etc against end game bosses they're only good against mobs, I can bet more fixers were duped in the last wave than legacies.
---
Isn’t the issue that there server can’t hold all the info or no?
---
It's in the first room in the mine, on a barrel, close to the crafting work benches
---
Nice job brother. Achievement hunter here myself. I just 100%’d fallout 76 the other day. Feels good.
---
It's right where you spawn when you join the event
---
The term magic was simply a result the Player base couldn't figure out why some guns were dealing extra damage, now we know it's a system based result of high RoF/Vats Shotguns doing higher than expected damage.
---
Christ Almighty you have the mindset of a child I almost feel bad. Seeing as how this game is the only thing you talk about it seems you have some kind of religious fenaticizm around it. I'm a huge fallout fan but you bending over backwards to suck tod Howard's dick isn't going to give you free fallout 1st.
---
I haven't unlocked bullion, how could it work?
---
By Caps is the problems the plans right?
---
Edit:
---
changed it to 
---
30.000, 1.000, 3000 in a week.
---
I have a two shot lmg with 25% faster rate that I named Oh Shit I’m Outta Bullets
---
And Project Paradise.
---
Holy shit same lmao.
---
Ikr, feels a long time coming.
---
"Free range" too.
---
I dont want a legacy, It'd make the game even easier than it already is. They just ruin the game, at the very least, it does on PC. 
---
Doesn't even need to be mass removal, could give compensation to people who have then, could simply swap the explosive effect, or nerf how much damage they do, because they do too much right now. currently the explosive effect is supposed to work like this on normal guns. It does a certain ammount of damage that scales eith demo expert, it's enough to get a bit of extra damage. But with these legacy plasma gats, they do even more because of the fire rate and, I think beam splitters? i know eith the rifles that's the case, meaning it does 5x as much damage as it should be.
---
Out of five attempts I've complete 3 and failed on two. First fail was because two players started using Tesla Rifles and the game just went super slow and Mr. William's was everywhere floating, flying, teleporting, going through walls it was bat shit crazy. Things also got pixelated and I could not aim correctly so yeah fail. The second was because there were only three of us and we were not even scratching Earle's legs one guy was using a missile launcher and the other died and stayed dead... I mean he just stayed there....on the ground... watching... I think. Those fails aside I'm confided I can solo with my heavy gunner with "Magic" guns but not with anyone else. I think its damage resistance is up just a little too high. I'm on the edge of agreeing that the effort is not worth it. Those Teslas though.
---
That is dope
---
Excellent, thanks for the advice!  I do worry about what they're doing to our bloody builds. :/
---
When OP posted this I had to check his username to make sure it was or wasn’t angry turtle since he posted a similar video days ago.
---
In that video it was a duo and they also buffed to the teeth with stealth commandos. Angry turtle was just running around farming wendigos before they finish.
---
Thanks and I agree that it punishes us unfairly. Hopefully that's addressed.
---
Now then, let me rephrase my followup.
---
I use two different First Aid perks on my main. One is a 3star version and one is a 2star version.
---
When my 160 is doing 2hander melee stuff, I use the 3star version of First Aid.
---
When my 160 is doing heavy guns stuff, i swap out to a 2star version of First Aid.
---
My question is if one of those 2 first aids that I actively use is likely to get eaten, even though neither are 1star extras.
---
This has happened to me as well.
---
I have a je plasma gat that I used for one run, but my teammates let me know it was causing them to lag so i stopped using it, then about 2 runs later I got to see first hand why.
---
 All I have to say is beware the explosive high speed explosive weapons, especially the explosive plasma gats with splitters. They may do a lot of damage, but you might end up losing more damage from your teammates in the end.
---
That was the one buggy issue I ran into.
---
Only 4 or 5 times?  lol.   Keep playing.  Smh.
---
but he said i would get it back after i took the workshop back?
---
It does for me. I love the comic book stuff in fallout.
---
idk i what u mean
---
That was a lie.
---
With the right gear and skills almost everything is possible solo.
---
I prefer fighting the SBQ solo, however after the next patch that might not be the case. 
---
I haven't tried Radiation Rumble or Colossal yet.
---
Buy junk
---
Just the last 4-5 times. I couldn't get shit to drop from Meat Week last year either
---
You never fail us! Thank you! 🙏
---
Edit: Even done faschnat and primal meats solo. Have not tried cookout and don't know of any other seasonal only been playing since the last free weekend.
---
This is where I am at, personally. I took the day off yesterday, didn’t even log in, and it felt good. When I do log back into the game, I won’t have worry that the autocomplete bug could get me. I can go back to Lone Wanderer and not fret about losing team XP bonus. I won’t have to chase Bobbleheads or workshops. Besides, the next season will be here soon enough. This game has no shortage of opportunities to grind for rewards. A pause between seasons is probably a good thing.
---
ok ty 4 the advice
---
I can only assume that people find more value in farming for script to probably buy legendary modules to craft specific legendary gear as at least they know what they are getting. As opposed to the HUGE pool of random that is all the legendary items.
---
I've seen Primal cuts fail a few times because there was an enemy underground that never came above ground to shoot.
---
Another week without the poodle skirt coming back. Sigh.
---
did he lie?
---
I actually hadn't ever looked... now I feel inadequate, LOL
---
Noice
---
I used to runaway and jump server.by all means avoid them if you cant win now..but at the same time start collecting gear to combat it.if they are bloodied grab  a decent gamma gun.that usually melts bloodied build.a quad tesla is very popular due to no vats - skill to spam somebody
---
I've done that a few times just today and everytime was a sad sorry group of no more than 5 with me being the fifth!
---
Lol! You just can’t handle you e been busted.
---
he probably meant that you could use the workshop to farm the junk again
---
yea i edited my last comment abit to try and answer you. I'm not 100% sure on the mechanics behind what is or is not deleted. So better i don't make guesses on that. Check out angry turtles videos about the subject.
---
&gt; **Legendary Weapons:** The Assassin’s legendary attribute now applies its bonus damage to human NPCs. 
---
My Zz 50 Cal Assin XPL thanks you!
---
It’s Bethesda, if you hop servers it should fix itself. Even if another player had named it that with the brackets, whenever they dropped it or traded it to you it would revert to its original name. If you got it from an enemy, just hop servers. You have nothing to worry about
---
What platform are you on? I’ll give you 1000 of each junk. PM me.
---
Well, after reviewing those pictures, it looks like my Atoms are safe. It feels like it's been a long time since I have been able to say that.
---
You've got me! EA hired me to post this!!!
---
I’ve joined up with random players using the public teams feature.    Most of the time people on those teams don’t really talk to each other because they don’t want or they don’t have a mic so it’s tricky to get a group together to do a mission together.  
---
For the scorch beast queen fight usually a bunch of people will just show up to help you fight her along with some of the other high level events. 
---
I played by myself for almost 6 months before brother bought the game, now I play mostly with him.   It’s nice to be able to fight some of the bigger creatures together because we can give each other ammo and stimpack each other.   
---
We have made several fiends playing that from time to time will join us.   One guy gave me a bunch of ammo and plans I needed for free.   Most people in the game have been nice.    Turn pacifist mode on in settings if you want to avoid PVP. 
---
Jet and Psychojet in Fallout 4 is extremely fun, I would highly recommend. On-demand slow motion makes for some pretty cool fights!
---
yep i always click the scrap junk button but i didn't know i could store my items. i think im lvl 40 something
---
So you’re saying you can’t do those solo as well?
---
Yeah for me i just use the stealth armor so that my glass cannon doesn’t drop to the mole miners waiting outside
---
Anyone who PVP in this game is using broken legacy weapons.  Ur not gonna beat them.  U have to join them then try to beat them.  
---
Nuka quantum spams and legacy weapons.
---
On a positive note that's 40 scrip per axe.lol rng is a bia.but at times I come across some gems somebody needs and that's when I come out on top.made some crazy deals with this wack rng
---
Oh oki, thanks so much for the quick response!
---
Go to the Bethesda website and submit a ticket under fallout 76, you’ll have to make sure you account is linked to an account on whatever console you have,
---
Yes if he took it he could have given it back. But it is also possible that the junk just vanished after you droped it depending on how much time has passed and how laggy the servers are
---
:'(
---
Power fist, the swords, deathclaw gauntlet. All lacking skins
---
I probably refreshed my main feed right after you posted it. No problem man
---
Clipping through the wall is not a legacy weapon problem. Report that player for cheating and move on. Want a good way to guarantee a good ACP run? Friend someone with a privet server and get 8 people together to run it as a specific group. Low lag, good builds, maybe even ask that no-one uses legacy, Hacked, or Magic guns just to see how they aren't the be all end all for good guns. If three people with blooded fixers can kill the boss in under a minute post damage need how is anything but the absolute strongest legacy &amp; magic guns a problem when legit options are better?
---
Just nuke him once to start the event.  Complete it.  Then on next run just nuke the SBQ.  It’ll trigger both events, then you’re grinding for SBQ but getting both events and rewards.  It’ll also add some delay between your silo runs so you can server hop a little less.
---
Hell even if you don’t launch a nuke the overseer will ask you why you did
---
Ahhh thats why
---
ty 4 the offer but my parents said i shouldnt tell strangers my private information but tyvm
---
Don't need to unequip starched genes to use a serum.
---
That's a hell of a lesson
---
I'm saying I personally can't. I'm sure it's possible to, I just can't (and don't want to bother with changing my playing style/build so I can).
---
I ran with one dude in public who used a few legacy weapons and we killed the guy in under a minute. It takes five minutes for the mine to even open
---
For the server it's simpler to save a double(128bit) then saving a weapon with a name, condition bar and it's legendary properties. Maybe not with one weapon but after 10 weapon you surely are at more values to track. You can test it by creating a new character and open your stash. It should've no problem loading it, meanwhile when I open my stastbox it's a slideshow
---
The game would be making a steady loss with 100k over all platforms. The majority of PC players are probably on Bethesda's launcher.
---
Appreciate it, thank you!
---
This isn't a long term solution. This will be patched and the collosus will still need to be improved.
---
It's entitled to want to play all the free content that comes with the videogame you've chosen to play? TIL.
---
This is the fakest shit I've ever read 😂😂
---
i think everything hapoened in 10 minutes and i dontt think there was lag
---
no one ever has .50 for sale.. so thats basically what i do.
---
Mix of combat and scout armor assassin sentinel and anti armor handmade
---
Don't be online during the reset.
---
Play Adventure Mode last before logging off (no NW, no Atom Shop).
---
Play Adventure Mode first after logging on (no NW, no Atom Shop).
---
Pray to whatever deity you believe in, if applicable. 
---
Those MIGHT help, but are not guaranteed to.
---
Sounds like so much fun
---
So you want a stash box that looks like a junk pile? Interesring
---
Yeah I figured it out, gave them a piece of my mind 😅
---
They acknowledged that it was unintended for unarmed to be nerfed so hard and have patched that in the latest PTS update.
---
I'd like that, but I'm already at 100% budget...
---
i spend a long time collecting junk bc i like to make my own guns and armur :( idk if i want to play any more
---
Junk can be stolen if you die
---
Fallout seems to crash a bit.at times it makes my x1x overheat hell if my wifi is being slow it will crash my box at times
---
Typical.
---
Grelok staff is buged. It remove the legendary effects of grognak axe on which it was put.
---
Ran across one that was very close to one of the Prime Cuts event in the forest.   I fell for it once then figured out how to get in without triggering the trap.   He had rigged up some pressure plates that opened a door.  When went through a trap killed you.    While I was in base he tried to shoot me which did not work because I have pacifist mode on.   I think he then went to build menu and did something that killed me right away.  
---
I watch his base for the next hour or so and every time I checked he was still there trying to catch people doing the nearby event.
---
Wish I was high enough level to do the event! It sounds insane!
---
Get better and don’t die
---
Xbox, Ps4 or PC is no private Information. I think your are a child or a Troll.
---
idk what u mean
---
Same here. Just finish 👊🏼
---
It may not help, but threaten to cancel FO1st subscription and that you’ll be contacting a lawyer if they refuse to process you request for atoms for the tanks you have been robbed since it is entirely their fault. Tel them it is unacceptable that they refuse to help and do not offer any solution.
---
I get you.dont let that deter you bro.some will say...workshop...pvp zone etc etc.workshops are good but I swear you can get a ton more junk with a scrapper perk card and running around having fun picking up everything
---
Earls revenge
---
Running the legendary set bonus perks in power armor. Melee power armor isn't good because you get soft capped on str
---
Well, i just saved some Atoms. Was going to buy to display it, but not now
---
Can you imagine your challenges are auto completing and then you get called out for having a fake account for not posting enough xD
---
Sometimes that’s how it is lol.
---
I only did enough dailies to rank up then logged off
---
It’s a joke. It’s clearly not important.
---
HE IS A TROLL!
---
We could have saved you the trouble and told you that was pointless to pursue.
---
Mind boggling right?
---
damn,thanks for the tips, I was playing while the reset happened, must of been it.
---
And also, I dont believe in anything, so do you have any tips on who I should pray to? maybe to you? have a pamphlet to a cult I could borrow? could really use someone to follow and adore tbh
---
In that case he probably took it and didnt want to give it back. Sorry about that. But contact me if you want a weapon crafted and/or modded. I probably also have some junk to spare
---
I believe we’re on the rug and bed now (which both feel like items they forgot to add to the shop in other bundles)
---
Yeah and it hasn't always been like that, only maybe since wastelanders or so?
---
It seems like with her I get some stealth buffs sometimes and sometimes none, sometimes I get all of them for a short time. Standing in full danger I do about 100 damage per shot, usually fighting her crouched with broken stealth buffs I still do better and get about 200-250 per shot, with full buffs though it's more like 650 per shot but I hardly see that since this bug surfaced.
---
Naw your just a jerk with issues about a game that you have to make fake posts. 
---
Later loser!
---
The guy was in no way rude in how he answered your question. You on the other hand just came across rather ungrateful.
---
pray to the person who busts their ass to upload Atom Shop updates every Tuesday.
---
Or Chally. We love Chally.
---
my parents said i should only share my gamer tag with my irl friends
---
Great tip!
---
If you find third person shooting awkward, like I do, I adjust my play style a bit for this event.  Instead of just shooting and reloading endlessly, I do a VATS mag dump in a clear spot, exit while reloading, move to a different clear area and repeat.  
---
I ate shit a few times on my first 3-4 tries, always to environmental hazards.  I haven’t died at all since paying more attention to where I’m standing.
---
Also, the exit is across the cavern from the entrance, in the far left corner!
---
Lol. In my line of work IRL, I hear bugs try and threaten me with lawyers almost every day. If I was Bethesda, I’d chuckle. But I see where your coming from. I actually have two subscriptions for FO1. One for Beth launcher and one for steam.
---
I hope one day we can have a system where we don’t need to worry about this stuff I enjoy this game but I hate the limited space it limits my enjoyment
---
Troll. Maybe a child troll.
---
Fuck I commented on the wrong comment. I stand by what I said though haha
---
Christ you are a kid I thought you were supposed to be older than 13 to get on here! Now scamp whiper snapper.
---
Thorn armor is character locked. Something odd is happening here.
---
do u mean the lvl 340 or me? i am a girl
---
&gt;Fast Travel: It is now free to Fast Travel to Foundation and Crater.
---
Woo!
---
they are only helpful on atoms stuff only, generally speaking
---
Wow, those curtains are FREE?  Awesome!
---
(Yes, I'm very excited about new curtain options)
---
Doc just doesn't want you getting shot in the head again. VATS doesn't seem to have any medical use other than monitoring yourself.
---
Did some digging around since you got me interrested. Here is an bethesda response to the duplication delete thing
---
" You receive Perk Card Packs for reaching levels 4, 6, 8, and 10 followed by every 5 levels after that (i.e. 15, 20, 25, etc). These card packs contain 4 regular cards and 1 gold card. If you get a pack that contains a duplicate of a perk card you already have and can not be ranked up (1 star), the duplicate will be automatically removed from your deck. "
---
You
---
yep that is how i collected my junk
---
*this* is the fakest shit I've ever read lmao I hope no one is soft enough to fall for this and offer you weapons and shit
---
Oh sorry for being mistaken. Just cancelled all my uni classes next week. Thanks for the heads up
---
The comment is not intended to invoke fear, but attention to my ticket. They will see challenges and give you a cookie cutter response. I threatened to cancel subscription and contact lawyer when my account was hacked and it finally got them to actually help me. Before then they said they would “look into the situation further, but was unable to help”
---
I think I will stick to chally, sounds pretty cool
---
I thought it was in the patch notes that they fixed that this week? But I guess not
---
They really just don’t give af. This has been happening since NW, how are they still “looking into it”? I’m so close to being done with this stupid grind. I’m not logging in for a while after I finish, this completely burned me out. If it doesn’t change for next season, I don’t think I’ll be participating.
---
I'm surprised I haven't seen more shotgunners - Enforcer works like a dream on those spawns.
---
My stealth crossbow build now/PTS.  Crossbows are among the slowest loading semi auto weapons apart from powder weapons/hunting rifle.  This is why I'd go semi auto with patch 22 if you can.  Right now semi is viable:
---
There is no such thing as an unprovoked attack in workshops. PvP is meant to happen in dedicated PvP battle arenas. It ain’t griefing if player conflict is built into workshop control. As for my camp, gratefully, nobody has ever deliberately gone after mine, but if they did, I would just block and/or server hop.
---
True and less frustrating
---
Try it with a controller that drifts up.
---
I ran 4 last night, in total. 
---
Seemed easy enough, as long as you avoid the AOE zones and keep wendigo swarms managed. Earle is enough of a dmg sponge that you can't go into it with a food build and think you're going to master it. Some min/max'ing and chem planning make it much more maneagable.
---
Same I’ve been using a bloodied Gatling gun and have been getting between 50-70 damage if I hit his head. But the fire rate is Garbo so it equalizes
---
I think maybe it might not happen,the reason being that repair kits are now the only incentive to do Scorched Earth vs doing a Colossal Problem. Scorched Earth might just die off completely, as it is already pretty dead right now...
---
Plus the new one that just came out. Just need the Mr. Fuzzy ones that came out (cowboy, new year and Valentine).
---
I have completed it 4x. Definitely a bullet sponge
---
Even though they added the human npc's damage to Assassins still not gonna use that prefix tbh
---
Gotcha. Ty
---
Or just a placeable junk tab in the building menu
---
Painfully obvious Skyrim asset reSkin
---
Yes.  Need those goggles!
---
That's why I didn't say all are. Feels like this discussion is going around in circles now.
---
YES! Signing on immediatley to get it
---
Nope, unless there's something like that in the daily ops (not in the pts so have no clue)
---
Praise be to Chally. She turns water into milk. What more proof do you need?
---
Omfg they're really back???  Oh damn this week is gonna hurt 🤑😂
---
T-65 chestplate is barely connected to the frame and you can fit a mininuke in the gap between the armor piece and the frame, and the lack of headlamp mods is your biggest concern with this armor?
---
Just to show how little Bethesda understands their own mechanics. Opened a perk card pack on my 60 today. 3 regulars and 2 golds. First time I've seen that.
---
I like using a bunch of rad barrels to make my camp look like a waste disposal site.
---
guided meditation is completely different story. There are multiple leg. ghools, when you one shoot one, happens.
---
Noticed the same thing. I played on and completed the few new quests. Now I have nothing but the repeatable weekly left.
---
This might be part of the reason, but I think it's more that if the enemy cannot detect you due to stealth, it removes any danger/fight from the Daily Op and means that you don't need to adapt to whichever Mutation the enemies have. While there might be better solutions than just having enemies see through stealth, I can understand why they did it this way, so that you can't just sit at each uplink and AFK through 90% of the Op risk-free.
---
Working as intended
---
Well CP has a guaranteed 3 star when you complete and exit the mine as well as a chance at another from the boss and even a 3rd from the box. I'd say that CP is hands down more rewarding.
---
Grow up! You are working at the Uni! Going to school is for Kids
---
Try lvling past 50!
---
What’s purveyor?
---
ty 4 the offer
---
Damn.ok put on pacifist mode on try and keep your junk stashed.i make it a point every time I see a stash box I unload all my junk.never know when death is around the corner.but if you must be in a workshop unload your junk.it can suck losing a ton of it..hope it goes well for you
---
I’m level 85 with a vanilla commando build (no bloodied, junkies, stealth) in excav PA and I’ve done it about 5 times with as few as 3.5 people (started with 4 but one died soon after mutation and got the res pawn bug). It’s a pretty simple fight. 
---
-Don’t die. It’s the most important thing. People having to come rez you or possibly getting the respawn bug is not good. If you are bloodied and keep dying, change how you’re playing (or maybe your build). 
---
-Kill adds. The windigos are a pain in the ass and will kill anyone given the opportunity. Even with a lackluster build and fairly shite auto rifles I can one shot the adds with a magic shotgun (no shotgun perks). Given my damage to the boss is much lower than most other people that’s usually what I focus on. Adds? Kill them. No adds? Shoot the boss. 
---
-Kill the boss. Every team I’ve been in has had 10 or more minutes left at the end so I always take any opportunity to loot some screws and ammo back from the adds. If you are struggling in the event don’t do that
---
i'd say get to 50. if you're still liking it try it take it for a month. 
---
I took it as i was on furlough and was playing like 12-14 hours a day. Freed up so much space in my stash by moving junk to the scrapbox. I have cancelled it now and in 2 weeks i will no longer have it BUT i can still use the junk i've collected. I've collected enough to last me about a year i reckon. Easily.
---
Most season passes in game once completed are exactly that, completed.
---
I have a camp nearby and if I fast travel to it and not the event directly it won't register me as apart of the event and I have to fast travel 5 feet on the map to get it to activate.
---
ok :(
---
Very generally. Have 2 bugged atom challenges. 3 tickets so far get ignored then autoclosed as lost score complaints  because no one bothers to actually read it. Filed one under FO1st issues today, let's see if that gets any attention.
---
😂😂😂Funny
---
Mama mumbles, legendary weapon roll
---
Also nice username, that’s one I’ll remember
---
It rides a middle line that I think won't interest most people.  It's weird and doesn't really fit the game's theme, but it's not weird and obnoxious enough for people who want to wear the really goofy stuff.
---
I think it will mostly appeal to people who are REALLY into the Unstoppables stuff.
---
Yea they even changes how the cards reward coins. It's now 2 for each card or rank. It used to be more for those golden cards.
---
other ppl are nice but i dont think u are
---
True, from a legendary farming outlook this makes sense. Thanks for the input.
---
September, according to the official website.
---
Shoulda mentioned, imma level 200
---
There is no radiation in the event if you use the event spawn. I threw my pa on cuz I expected there to be and there's none unless you exit the mine
---
It's incredible you can keep stealth with weapons that don't have a suppressor in that area
---
Never seen one
---
Ah fuck really?! I have almost 900 scrip saved up ready, was hoping that roll after roll after roll would finally get me the bloodied shit I’m in desperate need of
---
Interesting. I’ve tried both fast traveling directly there and near it then walking the rest of the way tho, neither have helped
---
GET 'EM OUT, BOYS!! WE DID IT!!
---
Now that's high quality assurance.
---
Not everything they add is going to interest everybody. I’m not interested in it, besides maybe the throne, but I’m not going to complain
---
Well I have done ACP twice and doubled my screw stash that I've been collecting for 3 months so there's that. I think both times I got 3* armor. I like ACP better at the moment because it's new and there are new plans to get. After I get all of those I probably won't do ACP every time it comes up but I will go occasionally. It provides a nice challenge.
---
Well, I said atoms stuff as in stuff that you spend your atoms for, not free challenges
---
Yea, it's part of the og story quests
---
Yes, I think tomorrow is the finish although I don’t know what time
---
I am definitely not nice.
---
Honestly I'd wait until you finish up the story and side quests. At that point you'll have a better idea of what the endgame grind looks like. If you still enjoy playing and want to go on for the long haul than yes it will definitely be worth it for you. If on the other decide you're not interested in it enough and only plan on jumping back at new content drops than no, it won't really be that beneficial for you.
---
I use a bloodied fixer and a bloodied quad tesla rifle, I can barely do 20 damage per shot, thats with nerd rage and no other buffs, and the damage over time from the environment absolutely destroys me lol
---
I zoom in on the event on the map, makes the event marker bigger and the player markers smaller
---
Great to hear 👍
---
While I wish there was more to the subscription, the scrap box you get and the survival tent are invaluable items to use during your travels in the wasteland. Having no scrap stash limit with the scrap box makes inventory managing sooooo much easier. The tent is great as a fast travel point and if you need to unload your scrap or stash your loot.
---
You just have to ask yourself if you can see yourself playing this game for the next year. I’ve read that some people try it for a month then cancel. I grabbed it for a year in April. So I’m all in for this game at least until then.
---
If you like this game and can see yourself playing it for another year, and have some spare cash, then you should enjoy the subscription
---
Extra emphasis on the MIGHT part. I did all of the things on that list of stuff not to do for most of the run and never had a single challenge auto complete.
---
I completely forgot about the amount of screws you can get, and acid from the teeth. Good point!
---
I swear most Of these types of post or OMG I logged in and my armor and weapons were gone. 
---
Then they get a bunch of replies to help them restock.  
---
Its a good social farm.   Lol
---
Since the most recent hotfix/update, camp item durability has been lowered significantly. My walls get destroyed in 3-5 hits by a max level ghoul, when they used to be able to withstand several minutes of continuous hits. In fact, all durability has decreased. I figure the Cursed effect was added to everything with durability.
---
Adding this gamer tag to my box I’ve never launched yet but I got two keycards and time to run for silo codes. Tried the event twice once we finished it the second time everyone was only farming screws. Regardless of farming them or not you get around 100 screws without trying to farm I’ve noticed
---
I got a 2-shot fast fire rate fast reload Gatling Laser while spending scrip for the first time yesterday, is it any good? I hit level 50 yesterday and I'm working on a Heavy Weapons/PA build so if its really good I'll be very excited.
---
Get scrip. Roll one or two. Repeat. Keep stocked up to 900.
---
Lmaooo. Extremely reductionist but alright. By joining at a low level you are telling everybody else “carry me or we won’t get this done” and acting like we’re the assholes for being annoyed. That is entitlement. Some people have clearly never been told “this isn’t for you” in their life.
---
Join all you want but don’t be surprised when we think you’re an asshole. You’re very possibly ruining the event for others, all because you feel like you just should be apart of everything, even if there’s no possible way you can do it without other people spending lots of resources for you.
---
September 10 I believe. Not too far off.
---
I didn't even notice acid, my eyes went straight to loose screws haha so yeah it is definitely good resource farming in that regard
---
This seems like it was added by hack. You can't trade or pick up thorn armor. If you had the plan you should know that the icon next to it is to show when you are wearing a matching set
---
Not only that, its fresh. I also enjoy the hazards within the mine which are just as deadly, if not more deadly, than the boss itself. The scram after killing the boss to get to the box and finally the rush to put on my stealth suit to not melt from rads when exiting the mine. Overall its a new experience. I'm sure after the 100th time it will lose some of the alure but for now I am enjoying it. Wish they could rush out several other zone specific nuke bosses like this. End game is in dire need of choices.
---
If people like it it'll be a feature, if they don't then it'll be a bug
---
I got no idea why this post got deleted lol. Figures I finally get a popular post and it deletes itself lol
---
Just as a general piece of advice, it might be worth avoiding Workshops. If you have Pacifist on then others can't PvP you without fighting over a Workshop.   
---
It won't get your junk back, but it'll at least stop something like this from happening again.  
---
Sorry to hear about it, all the same.
---
ACP seems shorter for the most part too. Sometimes Scorched Earth can last awhile if people aren’t using OP weapons 
---
I’m also all for enemies that drop my .556 ultracite ammo. I’m usually more focused on killing and looting wendigos then I am Earle lol
---
It's an issue with tesla rifles
---
U sure no one had a magic weapon?
---
Alright brother.  It’s VocalLaser. # is 7201
---
tyvm 4 the advice
---
Hmmm keep your hack secrets
---
Yep, sometimes it can take a while (especially when there's only a few mods overall or you already know most), but scrapping weapons definitely works. I did it with my gauss rifle on my sniper (took like 10-12 to get the scope, suppressor, and AP mag I wanted) and with my power fist to get the puncturing mod.
---
Even though it makes very little sense lol.
---
lol yesterday I were one of this low levels spending tons of plasma cores and failing the event. I didn't even know that there were a limit of players on this event.
---
Or just... not dying?  If you can't take the heat...
---
Chatmod already exists, and despite what some people say here, its wealthy and conversations happen everyday.  
---
There's a trade tab that is used everyday  
---
The chatmod community is big and getting bigger everyday. All countries represented.
---
Your stash is limited, there is probably a thread here or someone can send it to you on what to store in your junk and how many, generally don't store more than 200 of each item, there is a recommendation .. I can't resist myself and always store more, but stuff like ballistic fiber and adhesive would be your priority maybe and then stuff like coal, don't keep at all. Anyone who steals junk now days is so lame, so much junk around and they still have to be pricks ..
---
If these "limits" are so widely complained about and so off putting for so much of the vocal player base then at what point is it too much? When do we just walk away since they obviously wont change what we want them to? Is 2 years enough? Is most of this not the way the game has always been?
---
i agree
---
INT aside, can you actually learn crafting plans from scrapping found gear though?
---
No doubt, it's a good scam. This dude will end up with better gear by making one "poor little me" post than I have found in 3 months of legit playing 😅 and all he had to do was create a new account and put lots of sad faces. oh well
---
You fire, pop to caution, by time that slowass black powder reloads I'm undetected again. The wendigos actually just walk by if I'm not firing at them. Sometimes I just sit and pick them off for people.
---
I look forward to meat week being complete so I can focus more on the event. People like to launch nukes at the top of the hour.
---
Lol was thinking this too. Finally found it on the barrel. After my 6th time doing the event
---
So you aren't using stash boxes at all? It's one of the things the first camp quest teaches you to build. You couldn't have had that much on you as carry weight is pretty low at lvl 40ish.
---
Either way scrap, stash and sell at Train stations regularly!!!
---
Atom Shop update for those trying not to get shot by the cops RN.
---
1. I have that build, it's good to go
---
2. You have a 5 minute wait to change perks etc in the cave and 2:30 to get ready to fast travel to the event while the nuke drops.
---
3. Meh, depends on you
---
4. Any of those
---
5. I lost both times I tried my full health build to solo it. Got him down to like 2% health and the timer goes out lol. Bloodied can win tho
---
The sentry bot there disappears after exploding as well, but it's been that way for a while. I wonder if somehow related.
---
Kind of starts out like the Grognak emote where he holds the axe in the air except you hold the Grelock scepter and you spin it in your hand and then slam it down to the ground upright while it makes a little noise.
---
Platform?
---
Yes, I go grab the legendaries during that event asap. Never know where those things are going to fly off to.
---
I'm unsure how it affects the quest.
---
I know once you've completed it you can fast travel into the mine for the event, unsure if you need to launch on your own to complete the Something Sentimental quest.  
---
It's calmed down a little so the silos should be less buggy. My usual strategy of stealth + turret hacking doesn't work when the turrets don't have time to respawn.
---
Using Ultracite on a Gatling gun NOT on a queen fight is such a waste. It’s a DPS loss- Prime receiver replaces speedy receiver. Speedy is a 25% DPS increase; Prime is not except vs scorched.
---
thanks hux
---
I'm also constantly baffled that we have a bunch of shelves and cabinets that are even called display shelves, but don't actually function that way. It seems like there are a lot of doable ways to improve clutter placement in camps that just haven't been done. The only mod I used in FO4 was the one that let me place clutter without Dogmeat swinging his tail and knocking it over. Clearly there is demand?
---
The kicker is trying to submit a support ticket the first time it happens and being asked for video evidence of the auto completion and advise they can't adjust your points anyway.
---
As I don't record my gameplay at all and they can't adjust the score anyway I've just gotten into the habit of logging out for the reset. Sucks missing that meat event on the hour tho.
---
It’s a workshop, it’s meant for PVP
---
Yhe whole game, sans global events that are aimed for endgame
---
Hah! You can pry my camp location from my cold dead hands. I am not not redoing my build again. Took hours to get the floors just right for my build.
---
I swear they've recently increased the chances for good rolls. I got 3 (really good) bloodied weapons in a row a couple weeks ago when I bought from mumbles. Just seems to be better loot lately than all the laser pistols I used to get. That being said, if I get 2 bad things in a row I won't buy any more. No use throwing good scrip after bad 😅
---
Where's the gold one?! I bought this one today and would still get the gold one too if its there tomorrow. All my favorite photomode photos involve the rides like this and I've never owned one. So happy.
---
If I’ve ever wronged you beefy, please accept my most humble apologies. You are truly an asset to this sub.

Sure Bobby.
---
Omg amen! Happened multiple times to us over the weekend
---
I’ve had that issue, but it always only happens on extremely laggy servers. Have yours been real laggy? That was always the issue for me.
---
I cannot place the blueprint down at my camp, I am going to go out and say that this has been silently patched (Xbox).
---
Bro. Same thing happened to my m8 last night....Dude was melee and got wrecked at the final second....
---
This. Saw a tip for doing this on here last week and it makes a huge difference.
---
You basically copied angry turtle, congrats
---
Like the generic power armor color set ,  would like to see a set of generic color curtains other than just the color red.
---
It happened to a lot of people apparently today, myself included. Don’t bother sending a report for help either, they won’t do anything about it.
---
https://imgur.com/a/7vgkaXt
---
I feel like there isn’t enough time to loot, and also escape the mine.  I’ve also found that once the wendigo turn to meat piles, they no longer have ammo.  
---
I guess I could just let the mine collapse on me, but I’m really not that hard up for screws.
---
When this happens to me, it’s usually because my character has weight reduction perks. Those perks don’t apply to the stash.
---
Yeah, but the 25% dps lost is worth it.  Still killing Wendigos in 3 or 4 bullets, and the ammo I'm using is beging dropped in the hundreds by what I'm killing.
---
I agree but atleast he didn’t even let the dude send him junk lol
---
Other than events you can play the whole game by yourself. Id wait until you are higher level with good equipment to do a silo and launch a nuke, but I did it myself.
---
Bloody? And how many others are usually in your instance?
---
i hope it comes on live servers too, only bethnet players can do PTS, not us Steam or Game Pass PC players
---
Basically players complained cause they wanted to keep the animated cards instead of scrapping those for coins.
---
So, they decided 2 per card was fair since they took away the gold being worth more.
---
I’ve been able to pick up a couple one star shitty bloodied things I’ll never used and I’ve held on to them in the hopes that will influence the rolls because I seem to get stuff that’s similar to things I’ve already had or used but I’ve never gotten anything good that’s bloodied from her unfortunately
---
Duh! I never thought of that, I bet that’s the issue! Thanks!
---
&lt;Heart emote&gt;
---
Watoga has several pa spawns that'd be a good place to start
---
That is so damn stupid lol
---
Yea it was a good thing for those who want to save the golden ones.
---
Yeah that's the only confusing part. Maybe he's holding out for a better offer 😂 maybe working people over in PM, who knows
---
Umm, improved repair kit is not an atom shop item
---
Then... don’t die?
---
That doesn’t explain why it’s worth it. Just to farm ultracite 5mm for other fights? So worth it on that specific fight?
---
That would actually add something new and refreshing to the enemy spawns.
---
Yeah, it was me and 3 other guys. We killed it okay, but we were all dying left and right. It was my first time doing it and it put a poor taste in my mouth lol
---
Given that local chat is only voice chat range (100m) and only works with people who have it installed, why would it be active? unless you were playing with those people?
---
[You'll need to go savage divide,mire or cranberry](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power_armor_locations_(Fallout_76)
---
What console I would be willing to make some for you
---
The fact that they launched the season with it still being broken was them saying "we don't give a fk" Literally 99% of what they release gives me that feeling.
---
I got one for 9k in a vendor, I was so happy!
---
It's pretty stupid but I do better DPS with a flaming chainsaw than with my plasma gatling gun on him... so I'll run in when he's focused on someone else and lay into him.
---
But not just in a hazmat suit :-)
---
Colossal Problem.
---
That's 3 new plushies for me.
---
With the upcoming damage nerf i don’t think you need all that storage for your scraps. Tbh the biggest chunk of weight is steel and if you struggle to keep up with the ammo consumption, you won’t have much scrap left to store away. I planned to get 1st because my scrap mule is a full capacity, but now since they are nerfing all weapons I don’t think I’ll need 1st at all.
---
If only i had some... i'm so late on current run :(
---
*tears theirs Marathoner card in shreds*
---
So what. Every one looks at the dmg and says omg bloodied does twice as much dmg. So what. The only time that that matters is the queen and earl. Everything else dies in 1 hit no matter the build.
---
While I tend to want to agree with you, I don't want some low levels or do-nothings coming at the end of the fight just to get the rewards after my team and I use all our ammo.
---
Cool.
---
I agree wholeheartedly. I don’t know why I thought putting in a ticket would make a difference. I don’t know why I keep holding on to hope for them to fix their broken game.
---
How many did you get back? I was getting plenty of Ultracite shotgun shells and 50 cal back from the wendigo spawns but when I tried out my gauss shotgun they only gave me 1 2mm per body.
---
It’s also featured on Spongebob
---
Hadn't noticed that, placed it on the log cabin just fine
---
Fantastic!
---
It does
---
Daily ops mobs will too.
---
It should be 50+, technically a level 50 can be as powerful as a level 1000
---
Ah man that sucks. Hopefully you get some great rolls with this nice sale coming up. I can't find the dates now I think it's Sept 10-14 but I can't remember for sure
---
They don't give cores back someone else mentioned.
---
I joined my first SBQ at around level 18 😂
---
Ah, the ammo return is very nice. Especially if you aren't burning through a few thousand rounds.
---
I like it.
---
The CAMP and the stash box are cool additions.  
---
The main attraction for me is to play solo in a private instance; I can safely spend a few days hoarding junk and craft a crap load of ammo and then going back to the regular game and do quests/events/dailys and group events..  
---
Before that, I played mostly solo in regular games.
---
This quest line is bugged for me and I’m unable to complete it. I’ve tried starting over, dropping the quest, etc. Did anyone else experience this and if so, were you able to resolve the issue?
---
Zoom in and make it easier
---
No Green Commie PA Jetpack? Damn that sucks
---
Oh but those double point weekends are your compensation. Oh, your challenges auto completed during the double point weekend? oh too bad, well season 2 the challenges will be worth more points! Oh, they auto completed too? here's a shiny new atom shop item! Too much filler in season 1? well season 2 will give you radaway, stimpaks, nuke cards and nukashine, we have heard your prayers!!
---
I lost out on 26,000 score points before I completed the board on my main. Doesn't matter to me now, but I had to grind extra just to make up for it.
---
It's worth it in that you're getting replenished on ammo in that specific fight.  It's a long fight and and goes through a lot of bullets.  This way I come out net positive on ammo and can run the fight as often as I want.  No farming Flux.  Literally been using the event to farm ammo for my bloodied mini gun for sbq fights.
---
How?You can’t do anything at all with the vault.
---
damn dude watching the difference made me sad
---
The more that die in my instance, the more exp for me
---
He makes a lot of sweeping generalizations about the reddit FO76 community, that are not that accurate. He also is bandwagoning on FO76 hate, and while he does at times bring up a lot of valid issues with the game, will also bring up just as many non issues that don’t make a lot of sense.
---
The keys thing man. Why do I have a million keys I can’t drop? Idk if it adds to lag but it def is a pain if u wanna look thru ur misc tab
---
I’d rather get other stuff.  I never use these and keep getting them.  :-/
---
I literally loled... because that’s exactly how it is.
---
That also happened to me last night. Strange?
---
This messes me up all the time. I have to take off bear arms perks to see what's actually taking up the most room so I know what to scrip first haha
---
I'd prefer they weigh 0, tbh.
---
For those making 10,000 bullets for Earle RN
---
I love getting the High Radiation Fluids, Hardened Masses and Glowing Masses from the SE Event.  Not much to be had at the CP Event..
---
We lose 12k in score, but support can do nothing.
---
Alien backpack skin? Is that the one with a cat mascot in a glass dome? Or have I missed that one
---
Seems like that’s all the care about. Anything that has to do with money..
---
man, a TSE????  havent seen one of those in a while from a recent drop
---
That’s really a you question. Do you horde scrap? Do you want an additional FT point, do you buy a lot from the atomic shop? Do you want to play on a private server with no one to really help on events. 
---
If that’s worth $13/mo to you then go for it!
---
That's the new skin nerf that is live...
---
I don't see how its your job to define what people see as a challenge.
---
Next week it’s for those that acre completely burned out after the Legendary Run
---
Given the conext, I obviously meant improved scrap kit.
---
100% agree you either build a museum, spend a ton on the Atom store or have a lot of empty space.
---
That one in particular has been disappearing for a few months if not longer.
---
Seriously, I don’t get how they can do NOTHING. They can’t reset it? How is that possible? They literally do it every day/week
---
Noice. I'm not home but wanted to show appreciation for your post. 👍
---
And watch the week after, they'll all be in a bundle.  They just did that with the unstoppable outfits. They released one, and then had the bundle available for fallout 1st subscribers at a discount the next day.
---
Yes, 25 years after
---
That’s great!   But for those of us without op shotguns, we just have to be smarter then the average bear 😜
---
This was posted by a burner account. He has one post and no other comment history. Can we all agree we want this deleted so he doesn't scam someome?
---
It takes place 25 years after the war. Most characters you meet were around before. And no, the Chinese didn't ignore West Virginia... I assume you're not too far into the story yet... As to not spoil anything for you I won't give details, but they have a hand in both the main story and WL story.
---
That would be even better
---
Same
---
26 years after the bombs dropped.  
---
By all indications, West Virginia wasn't actively targeted, that's why there's nothing like the Glowing Sea anywhere. It's just sustained the fallout from a lot of other targeted locations.  
---
As for being ignored by the Chinese? No, no they were definitely not ignored, they simply weren't attacked with atomic weapons. There's more than enough Chinese presence in Appalachia to prove that.
---
The wasteland is not a safe place for anyone and doesn't discriminate.
---
Gotta love that clear glass
---
I was at 26,000 points lost before I ended up grinding out the board and finishing it.
---
This was the first day of the season board being released for me.
---
https://i.imgur.com/Lt4LjJj.png
---
I did one daily and noticed two of my weeklies were already done. And it just kept happening.
---
I'm not in favor of removal, but a strong nerf?  Absolutely.
---
It pisses me off that in the current PTS rebalance, everyone is getting a significant damage nerf *except* the people with these magic guns, who can still melt Earle and the Queen in a matter of seconds.  It's not right.  When the majority of boss encounters now end this way, I'm sorry, you lose the privilege and deserve to be brought in line with everyone else.  And don't come crying to me about your loss, because this is what the rest of us will already have to deal with.
---
I said the other day, I really can’t stand people who do shit like that knowing full well that it screws others over. I’m 300 and will even go out if my way to make sure as many people as possible get loot. 
---
I even said to a buddy of mine, I wish I had the skill and knowledge to completely delete someone’s character. I wouldn’t abuse it and would save it for only the more heinous people. But for some people, like greifers and people who purposely one hit kill legendaries, I wouldn’t hesitate. All they do is ruin the game for everyone else.
---
Shooting at the loot bag on the floor and the new player runs away thinking you're trying to kill him
---
I had a similar issue with second run last night. I joined the event, waited by the rubble alone. Another joined right as it was about to open. We fought well, just the two of us, for a while. I got scared into the drillbit and died. I sat, wailing for help and the other never came over for a revive. I get the "respawn" X and it pops me outside on the map in "select respawn location" Huh?? So I go to the social tab, and there's no way to travel to my teammate or spawn at his location. Bummer. No indication on the map or in my team windows of how to get back into the event. I choose to spawn at the mine and I end up outside in a rad storm. Looks like my teammate is still inside fighting. Oh well, I choose to travel back to my camp and it hangs on infinite loading screen. I force close the game and log back in. I arrive back on top of the mine in the rad storm, so I may have been placed in the same server, not sure.
---
TLDR; there needs to be a way to rejoin the event if you die and spawn outside.
---
This been goin on for more than a year w/o any of the devs talkin bout it during their precious quakecon.  They most likely see this as a public server issue; so this acts as an incentive for players to pay for fallout first to try avoiding such players.  It’s all about money in the end.
---
Yeah I was in a team of three and we got put in one by ourselves. You need at least 6. 4 people on Earl with op builds and weapons. And 2 op melee players taking out Earl's shithead kids. If you're lucky you'll get a full instance, But it will still be an ammo sink. That was my experience, others might know better.
---
 Alternatively, you could go bloody stealth. Someone posted videos in this sub detailing their builds and they were able to put him down in under a minute. 
---

---
90 thousand players on Bethesda launcher is a HUUUUGE stretch. If there isn’t at least half of that on the largest gaming platform on the planet then something is up.
---
This is their way to get you to play more. Gun breaks, run out of kits, use materials, run out, go collect more.
---
Indeed, nerfing would be the next best thing. From what I understand the explosive energy weapons are outright bugged and do more damage than they should, something to do with beam splitters adding more explosives. bot only does more damage to the bosses, but to my computer as well
---
And an image I'll be trying to forget.
---
Yeah, you’re not really wasting too much in this event if you loot the bodies. Maybe only a couple hundred rounds or so? If you’re efficient is lol
---
You can also find a broken camera at the top of the lighthouse. It needs to be fixed
---
I am finishing this evening as well
---
So the Chinese didn't see using powerful weapons against WV as worth it. And just sent in robots and soldiers etc?
---
Did you guys use the rez for 2 minutes of +50% damage perk?
---
Yes, it had a flat roof so no jumping over walls!
---
I remember only the other week when another high level player joined this event. 
---
They made a mad dads for the legendary loot and got blew up, I did the gentleman thing and revived them with a stimpack. 
---
That particular legendary was available to loot.
---
Gone
---
I’ve been having a bug recently where the boss loot won’t appear on the body for like 3 minutes, so it’s impossible for me to get stuff from earl before the timer :(
---
I haven't played the game too much. And in the beginning, I was rushing through text and dialogue.
---
Just cripple him while others are attacking
---
Had to place it in the wood backed one
---
Yea i try to launch them after meat week but I'll admit last night before bed I threaded the needle a little close. We got it done and made it in time for the meat sweats but barely.
---
Its a lvl 100+ boss. It is absolutely endgame content
---
Ghouls, but a mutated version caused by cannibalism before the ghoulification.
---
Very much agreed.
---
I have a legacy jetpack on every suit I own other than my T-65(it's jetpack looks great and I love that aesthetic), and I would gladly give those up to have the full suite of PA mods we're supposed to have. Really, I'd give up all my legacy items if it meant the game just functioned as intended.
---
Hey mate, no we didn't - link to the full build used in the post :)
---
https://imgur.com/a/DbwMdRg
---
To simple this down, if a nuke lands anywhere on the map while a nuke is also active on monongah mine, the event will trigger.
---
Those changes seem really good. Also great news about the assassins prefix.
---
I did that, everything else had turned into melted piles and still no legendary.
---
Based on that atom count,
---
"...for those not using their atoms right now"
---
Eh heavy gunner here so efficient may not be a term I am familiar with haha
---
That's cool. It fills in the gaps in Fallout lore by showing us what it was like for the people who had to deal with the Fallout world in the early years. These people would be the pioneers creating the foundation for a lot of the games that take place in the future.
---
There's nothing that can be done so you may as well cancel now
---
I wish Bethesda would boost the light output on them.
---
I'm not
---
Man, this is a joke. Thanks for the input lol, I just can't believe this bs
---
That's how it's been since the first ticket was submitted. It sucks.
---
Nuke &amp; do colossus, then nuke again on sbq covering all cheese spots that lets you fight in non-rad zones. Colossus event will magically re-open; down it asap so you can head to the queen you just nuked. Hopefully no one kills the queen by the time you get there. This works better in private as you will all know &amp; communicate with each other via voice chat e.g. discord; and, u don’t have to make it harder to kill sbq as you would on a public to get there in time. 
---
U just have to nuke colossus once; then rest on sbq. This lets you do 3 colossus &amp; 2 sbq on a fresh server. 
---
Hopefully this gets hotfixed soon tho; in the meantime, take advantage of this “new feature” just like “magic guns”
---
My games just been bricking everytime I try to exit the mine.
---
You can collect items in said vault
---
Now I want to do a Ming the Merciless (from the Flash Gordon movie of course) character....and rule the wasteland!
---
I don't even know why Fishbone is a raider to begin with. Dude is just too nice for it.
---
I beg your pardon?
---
That wouldn't be hard to do. It was definitely the worst event x10.
---
Lol fair enough
---
I don't understand why these two things are mutually exclusive...
---
Yeah, you can unlock most mods for Weapons and Armor this way. Although some can only be found or bought. Trick is to craft the lowest level piece, to save materials. Scrapper and Super Duper Perks are your friends.
---
I joined for the first time today and a lvl 54 escorted us all out. (PS4) thank you for your service
---
Idk then. That's what I've always done. Sometimes I have regular legendarys dissappear but the robots always turn to metal piles
---
There have been stability issues since the patch went live on PC, so it's not surprising that it's causing issues on consoles.
---
We released a new patch for the PTS earlier today, August 25, which included several improvements and bug fixes. Here are some of the highlights from that update. You can also scroll further down in this post to find changes from our previous PTS updates.
---
Design Updates
---
Hunt for the Treasure Hunter Returns!
---
Starting at 12:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday, August 26, we’re planning to bring the Hunt for the Treasure Hunter event back to the PTS, along with several design changes we’ve made as a result of player feedback.
---
Going forward, Treasure Hunter Mole Miners will now spawn in all regions of Appalachia
---
Treasure Hunter Mole Miners now scale with One Wasteland, up to level 50, and they will drop legendary loot that is leveled appropriately.
---
We’ve separated Treasure Hunter rewards from the Holiday Scorched rewards list, and added a number of new rewards that are exclusive to Treasure Hunter events.
---
Treasure Hunter Mole Miners now have an increased chance to drop Ornate Pails, and players now have an increased chance to get Treasure Hunter exclusive rewards from lower-quality Pails.
---
Additionally, we’ve greatly reduced the Cap prices of Treasure Hunter Pail crafting components that can be purchased from Vendors.
---
Items
---
Legendary Weapons: The Assassin’s legendary attribute now applies its bonus damage to human NPCs.
---
Daily Ops
---
New Respawn Locations: We’ve implemented additional respawn points during “Daily Ops: Uplink” and your respawn location will now be randomized among them to reduce the chances of being spawn camped by enemies.

---
Art: The Super Mutant Firestarter Boss during Daily Ops now uses the correct face texture.

---
Enemies
---
Active Camouflage: Fixed an issue that could allow players to see enemies with the Active Camouflage mutator through walls and other cover.
---
Enemy Levels: Fixed an issue that could prevent enemy levels from scaling correctly during Daily Ops instances.
---
Enemy Levels: Fixed an issue preventing enemy levels from scaling up correctly at Rollins Labor Camp.
---
Legendary Creatures: Fixed an issue causing legendary enemies to have lower health than intended if their level had been adjusted by One Wasteland.
---
Pathing: Fixed an issue in which deployed sets of Power Armor could block enemy pathing during Daily Ops.
---
Resilient: During Daily Ops, the Gamma Gun’s radiation damage no longer bypasses the need to last-hit Resilient enemies with melee attacks.
---
Turrets: Turrets in the Pump Station room now correctly target and attack players in non-Daily Ops versions of The Burrows.
---
Volatile: Fixed an issue that could prevent some Volatile enemy explosions from dealing damage to nearby players.
---
Alien Blaster: Players can now correctly switch back to the Standard Grip mod after applying the Sharpshooter Grip.  
---
Daily Ops: Reduced the amount of condition damage taken by players’ weapons and armor in Daily Ops instances.
---
Loot: Weapons that players can loot in starting areas, like immediately outside Vault 76 and at the Overseer’s C.A.M.P., now correctly scale down to level 1 for level 1 characters.
---
Loot: Enemies that drop contextual ammo can now correctly drop Arrows, Crossbow Bolts, and 40mm Grenade Rounds instead of random ammo when players kill them with the appropriate weapons.
---
Legendary Perks
---
Blood Sacrifice: Fixed an issue that could prevent Blood Sacrifice’s effects from applying to teammates.
---
Retribution: Now triggers correctly when blocking enemy Bash attacks.
---
Survival Shortcut: The fanfare that appears when Survival Shortcut’s effects trigger no longer uses placeholder art.
---
NPCs
---
Fishbones: No longer flees from nearby hostiles at Ohio River Adventures.
---
Quests and Events

Daily Ops: Vernon Dodge’s voice lines now play correctly during “Daily Ops: Uplink” when speaking with him at Watoga Towers.

Gauley Mine: Enemies and loot inside Gauley Mine now scale up more appropriately with player levels.

My bad, I just used the "mini" from what someone else had said. As I had mentioned in a different comment that I had yet to do the event myself, I was just thinking they would be spawning up as "wendigo spawn" which seemed weaker than your regular glowing wendigos. 
---
I get you there though. I enjoy helping new players out, giving them some gear so their start isn't so slow, but there's still the need for each player to understand their own limitations.
---
Got them a while back as part of a glasses pack, love the mothmen glasses. Recon they will cycle back at some point like everything else does.
---
Crippling absolutely does work.  While it doesn't cause him to stop moving, he moves much slower, and the heads lose their accuracy and won't attack as often.
---
[until the boss is dead you say?](https://youtu.be/VRgdSxbf50U)
---
You just want to engulf West Virginia in a mountain of trash to satisfy your super villain needs and desires.
---
Quabity assuance
---
well i guess thats a lesson learned the hard way.
---
he seemed half decent in how he was showing you some stuff. course he probably just didn't want to give the stuff back if it was that much but probably did not know exactly how much and what he got.
---
Did you just start? A lot of this is answered through the main quest. 
---
But yes it’s 25 years after the bombs dropped IIRC.
---
Edit: 26, thank you wastelanders.
---
Man, I'm never doing a collosal problem again. First time I ever did it, I focused on keeping the Wendigo bastards off the rest of my group (all random people) and then I had a lag spike while trying to pop a stimpak and it was the perfect storm of fuckery: life saving didn't proc, nor did mysterious savior, and since I was tanking ALL of the Wendigo, no teammates could get near me (one tried and had to run away when the anorexic little shits tried to jump him) so my timer runs out and I respawn... Just as they down the Colossus, and the mine collapsed. So I respawn outside the mine with no way to get back in, and well over 100 screws and various scrap laying in the mine. 
---
So I didn't get to loot the boss at all, lost all of my scrap, and the event reward was a garbage 2 star nocturnal +1 charisma raider chest piece.
---
To add insult to injury, I was streaming it for a group of friends and they all got to have a good laugh at my misery and misfortune as they watched me getting fucked in real time.   
---
tl;dr tried to be a nice guy and tank annoying Wendigo shits so PUG could focus on the boss and lost the boss loot and all the screws and loot from the Wendigo in the process. Bethesda needs to make your loot bags respawn outside the mine when that shit happens.
---
I’m aware of killed enemies returning to the place of their death, I encounter this at the Whitesprings when the vehicles blowup. 
---
I usually continue doing other things then return to see if anything appears, certainly not since these last 2 events at AWOL.
---
Damn, that sucks.
---
Well, I don't think that helps me considering all of my weeklies are gone too.
---
Can you update me on what happens with you? I have also requested Atoms in the amount to fulfill my lost tiers. I highly doubt it.
---
Been on a server that pulled this off flawlessly. However since it is going to be patched I try not to consider that looking at long term benefits, if that makes sense. But I agree, do it while you can.
---
Bog outfit was July I believe, I don't think there was anything this month.
---
I started when the game came out, rushed through the text and dialogue. Then stopped. Then recently came back to the game. And then heard the Overseer talking about her life before the war... And I was like WTF... She's a vampire(assuming like in the other Fallout games, the war was a long time ago) or a ghoul with a mask or something like that?
---
This checks out, I've never even played NW and I avoid the atom shop like the plague and so far I've not had th auto-complete bug.
---
Holy shit? What level are you?
---
Ahh mines in the clear case next to 3 Mr fuzzy bears. Really weird it has a display issue
---
running fireproof helps with that for sure! The gauss shotties are all explosive by default, I have made the mistake of pulling the trigger with a ghoul in my face!
---
Find another game would be my advice
---
I sure the frame rate drop is probably the main initial cause for most deaths. Heck, whenever I get hit by ghouls, every single animation, effect, and such stacks and drops my framerate so hard that I'm dead the next second.
---
Which is sad because you should be able to get those items. Oh well though.
---
I got upgraded to a supervisor so now I’m waiting to hear replay
---
Tamed a legendary Deathclaw once and he mutated defending my CAMP from mole rats. Became a 2 star for the rest of his life before he died to a glitch.
---
“For those wondering why I’m saving these atoms RN”
---
“For those who miss Fasnacht RN”
---
“For those who don’t want to Donate scrap to BOS next week” (or whenever round 2 starts)
---
“For those missing chally’s milk RN” (this is my favorite)
---
The developers have not provided customer support with a tool to modify SCORE. And customer support has been directed to stop attempting to escalate such requests.
---
Try a different tactic; request Atoms instead of SCORE. They *do* have a tool to refund/award Atoms.
---
I just want some skins for unarmed weapons. They have been totally overlooked in the game.
---
I guess ?
---
CURTAINS GIVE ME LIFE! But seriously, prior to the arrival of curtains the coziness was lacking without them.
---
I personally don't mind, but then again I play a heavy gunner which I can easily swap perks to melee.
---
If I could create a mutation, I'd add a reflective shield that reflects all shots back at the player for a second, then drops for a few seconds before regenerating.
---
That way commandos would either kill themselves by bouncing their 20k damage sneak crit back in their face, or use some other form of aoe damage like a grenade or explosion to bring down the shield then shoot them and kill it that way.
---
I wouldn't want this on every enemy, just as a random mutation on some of the "boss" enemies.
---
Are you subscribed to Fallout 1st?
---
I wonder if they'd actually do this. I haven't purchase anything related to the legendary run with atoms, so i sincerely doubt it, but who knows, worth a shot! Thanks friend
---
That's what I do with my explosive 50 Cal! My accuracy is 100%, I'm just aiming at everything!
---
Glow sight 3\*
---
I’d this happen when I first did the vault raid, that 3 star legendary sentry bot blew up never to be seen again. 
---
I hung around for ages in that room and nothing showed.
---
West Virginia wasn't regarded as a valuable enough target for a strike with what nukes they had.  
---
As the next bit is spoilers, I'm going to tag accordingly as a courtesy to others:  
---
&gt;!There, however, spies in the State due to its proximity to Washington and various military installations.
---
The Ma Dolce factory is a front, with the area underneath a fair sized lab/bunker for the Chinese, where they were working on better understanding American Power Armor and developing new versions of the Liberator robots, among other standard pursuits of espionage and probably trying to make dissidents out of students at VTU.
---
Near the Whitespring golf course, underground, is a massive Chinese facility with at least one suit of stolen Power Armor and a most of non-feral Chinese ghouls still manning the place. They were there, in the very least, to spy on the noteworthy individuals who would stay at the Whitespring and may have had a lead on the Whitespring bunker's existence.
---
All that said, most of the Chinese presence we encounter now isn't actually from the Communists, but rather than attempt by the Enclave to escalate DefCon so they could launch Appalachia's nukes at China.!&lt;
---
Ah sorry, yeah I knew for mods, I meant for gaining the ability to craft the actual weapons - like if you scrap a bunch of combat shotguns you could learn to make combat shotguns.
---
Someone was trying to tell me that worked (I think in regards to some piece of armor) but I've never had it happen with all the stuff I've scrapped, so I'm sure they were just yanking my chain.
---
I have been wanting deathclaw armor/outfits for literal ages. Maybe one day papa Todd
---
Blood eagle and raider outfits are abundant in the atomic shop, and it's fairly easy to mix and match pieces to make a raider look with lootable items. Don't know what you're on mate
---
Look at the date in your Pip-Boy. 
---
It’s 2103. The Great War was in 2077. 
---
For example, if the Overseer was around 30 at the time of the Great War, she’s only about 56 now.
---
Finished the board, took a couple days to massively grind it out so I'd not have to worry about it anymore. Main is 357 now.
---
Alt is 95 on the board, and 167 level wise.
---
Hope for a better tomorrow.
---
This. I'm fine with letting them sit in my vendors cheap for new players to buy and keep the economy alive and fun for the influx of players but having to save space in the stash for 25-50 lbs of plans is asking a lot especially if we're not being able to sell to NPCs for their supposed "value" which is usually much higher.
---
deal with it. They're not gonna give you points and it's possibly gonna happen again. move on. play the game. or don't
---
I've been getting disconnected in the middle of Meat Week events since before the patch. It's been...frustrating.
---
Hell Yeah, 40mm grenades dropping with the new ammo system makes my explosive build very happy.
---
Omg SAME!! I was so upset. It was the first and only one still where we had enough people and actually killed the stinkin thing..
---
This. Exactly what I want.
---
I could not agree more!
---
Yeah I remember when big mutants scared me. I still miss my pet deathclaw (unrelated but hey)
---
I really don't like most of them. I like the quack outfit and that's it. Fashionable raider outfit is good too. But I think the choices we have in cosmetics are pretty lackluster.
---
Were it so easy...
---
I totally agree about the hairstyles! It gets a wee bit old only having the same few options we've had since launch. Sometimes you want a new look, not a recycled old one.
---
Joining via the quest market puts you inside the cave or the radiation zone? Can't fast travel on PA unless I decide to get rid of 200wt worth of items
---
Everybody says this game needs text chat but what it really needs are people using headsets on consoles.
---
Thanks for doing this. Definitely a couple I don't have that didn't know could be unlocked.
---
Looks like I'll keep saving on atoms this week
---
It’s worth a shot. Someone I know did get a positive response to their request around the week two. 
---
And prior to the Legendary Run, I had the auto-completion occur twice and was compensated back both times. Screenshots help, by the way.
---
Either revert the atom challenges, at least for the daily. Or reset the board, remove the cosmetic squares and replace them with atoms/bullion/lunch boxes/scrip/caps/junk and let us go through it all again, that way the daily/weeklies aren't wasted. They gotta do something because it was extremely short sighted of them to not have a system in place for those that complete the board.
---
But then again, the filler was a big complaint with the season 1 board, so with season 2 instead of listening to the feedback, they doubled down on the filler and actually made it worse (stimpaks, radaway, nuke cards, nukashine)  so I doubt they'll really do anything about this.
---
What
---
I ran 2 solo, using a furious build and a junkies build. Stealth builds dont do damage on him for some reason and the vats crit is broken I think.
---
Screw bloody pts players I want a chance on console  at the croc backpack. After doing meat week 50 times with no tenderiser and doing colossal problem 10 times with just cursed weapons and the rug plan this is just the icing on the turd cake
---
Oh I didn't know the Pip-Boy reveals the date.
---
Oh, well I didn't realize *you* didn't like them, this changes everything
---
Basically
---
Yeah no problem! I'm more shocked that no one has done it yet. You know that the Wiki only lists the frames you can buy in the Atomic Shop?
---
It definitely could be an issue that all sentry bots have. I don't kill enough of them to know.
---
Would love a bright mod that actually uses the extra lights on the shoulders of the excavator. Would have thought that PA made for mining would have had the brights lights.
---
Edit spelling
---
I'm all for getting *something* in lieu of score once we're done... But they're not going to give us Atoms again. I know people think it's evil that they want us to buy them, but they need to make the game profitable.
---
Yeah so you get where I’m coming from. Like one of them has an instigating sledge and I’m like that’s cool for ghouls but a drawn out fight that’s garbage in terms of dps 😭
---
Maybe send them a message and submit this information so they can add it there as well to help future players.
---
Yea that’s one of the cool things about the game is a lot of people were around pre-war. Our overseer in 76 was the original overseer and entered the vault the same time we did.
---
Try a different tactic; request Atoms instead of SCORE. They do have a tool to refund/award Atoms.
---
Daily deals for those who misses plushie this week

---
&gt;Loot: Enemies that drop contextual ammo can now correctly drop Arrows, Crossbow Bolts, and 40mm Grenade Rounds instead of random ammo when players kill them with the appropriate weapons.
---
Good stuff. Now I hope they make it so the grenade launchers (and other explosive launchers in general) have better condition, because they break so fast it's outright disgusting and impossible to use them without hundreds of improved repair kits.
---
Jeez dude, I think most people can agree on the cosmetics being extremely lackluster, especially the legendary run rewards and no hairstyles. No need to be a twat
---
Holy shit, the Enclave are insane... Based on that and based on how they were in Fallout 2.
---
The chat mod uses preexisting files lol
---
😂😂 why not?? Change my mind
---
Well I agree about the hairstyles but I guess that doesn't matter
---
Some people, myself included, avoid voice chat like the plague because 99.9% of the time the only thing coming in over it is hate and abuse.
---
True, I should see what I need to do to get this on the Wiki
---
I think anybody referred to as a whale isn't necessarily running low on money
---
Dont listen to this guy. He's just mad that his friend got eaten. Which was definitely not me, by the way.
---
Usually I'll try fight back and if I can't compete I'll server hop. Happy to pvp but not to get shit on repeatedly
---
That’s a great suggestion
---
Also if there is less people there will also be less wendigo spawning in. I've done killed the ugly bastard with friends as well and it's harder with the more people
---
Right!! I didn't like that they reused hairstyles from 4 but it's really getting old now :((
---
Not that common, ran it 10 times and just rugs and cursed weapons
---
Actually yes. Especially since the headlamp is shining the the side of your power armor instead of forwards.
---
Recently, I have run into players several times who have the same weapons with the same legendary effects for sale. That would explain it.
---
Ah right, nah that's not a thing unfortunately. You can learn Combat Helmet Paints from scrapping Combat Armor (I think)... But they're useless haha.
---
wrong forum
---
Ah yeah, that's the new Yielding perk. It's like Unyielding but removes 3 stars from all gear no matter what your health level.
---
Every so often they release good waste landy stuff in the atom shop. That's general what I save mine for... I've been rocking the Stalker outfit since it was first available.. It pairs really great with a gas mask and mining helmet.
---
oh boy, I have one of those lying around in my stash somewhere. should pull it out again and try it on him next time.
---
I think you're on the wrong sub, bud.
---
It just works
---
I've never seen that one I think, I'll keep an eye on it!
---
I didn't say it was common. I'm saying its pointless to trade unobtainable gear for something that is a reward from a permanent event
---
Yeah they really shouldn't pull that shit, that's sleazy. I'll be buying all the plushies I don't have as they are released. But it would be a kick in the seeds of they release them all afterwards like the unstoppables.
---
Yep, agreed. I do the same, but maybe if the internet wasn't a pile of shit where people treat one another like garbage for no reason... then we could all play the game as it is intended rather than add a text chat. Thats how sad online gaming is lol
---
First time you pop into the event it puts a quest marker on the holo but it's a barrel right in front of you when you first enter the mine with a yellow flood lamp next to it.
---
Of course I find her every freaking day there and it’s always stupid stuff no outfits ever. Someone hooked me up once on their server and I only got the clean straight jacket and everything else I bought wasn’t really rare. I seriously find her numerous times a day and it’s usually chem recipes. Ugh
---
I got targeted by everything and Ahmad a minute wait time when Earle died
---
Aight cool, thanks for clearing that up lol.
---
That would be incredible
---
If there was a way to communicate with people other than voice that would be great cause sometimes I’ll literally just say my mic is broken because talking to people gives me anxiety, and I’m sure a few of you guys can probably relate somewhat
---
Oh it's much worse than that. They opted to let the Supermutants run free for the same reason and the Scorched wouldn't exist at all without them.
---
Bethesda customer support is the worst I've ever dealt with, they send out that generic message to everyone, and when called on that bullshit they "close" the ticket. They Can help, they have access to our account info, but they Refuse to help.
---
What do you mean stealth builds don’t work? I’m not even one and I was able to stay hidden a good number of times with a BE Fixer
---
Awesome dude. Also I love how people are down voting this post like I never said anything bad about the game, I just said 8 have no reason to play it
---
Make it
---
That's how I felt when a level 17 joined our instance and literally did ZERO damage- not even taking down the Wendigo Spawns. Sorry dude- I am not wasting the Stims on you, I need them.
---
Thanks for the heads up. I get I may sound entitled, but I pay for fo1st and buy atoms 2-4 times a month. I feel Im at least entitled to not being forced into buying MORE ATOMS for the run
---
ok its totally bugged out for me as some days i cant do it at all and some days i can do it every hr, my camp is in the toxic valley so i am in the region alot.  and the robot does say he is bad with days and thinks its the weekend, so random af for me
---
I also want to add that we are super coordinated now, communicating with other high levels and making sure that we join the event as soon as it pops on the map, so that we dont get shafted with a half empty instance. Bethesda still needs to do some fine tuning on this one.
---
Everything in the game is possible to solo, but SBQ and ACP are going to be the toughest to solo and require a very specific high DPS build or a glitched or legacy weapon. Some events like Project Paradise and Radiation Rumble are possible to complete solo, but impossible to get max rewards solo. Even two out of three of the old vault raids were doable solo, but those were shut down and there isn't anything comparable in terms of difficulty in the game now.
---
So in a way, it's like letting us role play as ourselves if our world suddenly turned into one like the one in Fallout and we managed to get into a vault(if you make your character look really old). Not for me though because I'm in my 30s. I would have to become a ghoul in order to exist in Fallout 76. But some Generation Zers will be able to wander around West Virginia in Fallout 76.
---
Shishkabob would sell since it helps NPCs.  Don't know why they haven't made a skin.
---
&gt;This was posted by a burner account. He has one post and no other comment history. Can we all agree we want this deleted so he doesn't scam someome? 
---
You and I must be reading a different comment section. It appears as though OP has refused trade/donation offers multiple times (although this does not exclude the possibility occurring through direct messages).
---
Personally, I believe this post may be helpful to other new players as some comments contain useful advise.
---
I do it anyway.
---
Gangly Legs! Lol
---
YES the 60 second timer is KILLER. Especially when you're towards the end of the event and you get bitch slapped by a Wendigo and get timed out of the event entirely.
---
If they want to make the game profitable, the need to stop breaking the game every patch. They need to stop making lazy cosmetics. They need to price the Atom Shop stuff fairly.
---
I don't think it's evil to have to buy some Atoms. I buy some on occasion. But I spend far less than I probably would if they would just price stuff reasonably, and give us cosmetics and camp stuff that isn't half-assed, broken, missing keywords, etc
---
If they actually did stuff \*right\*, I'd throw my wallet at them...and I know I'm not alone.
---
West Tek is good XP/Legendary farm for high levels. It's also a great proving ground to experiment with new builds and weapons in.
---
This event needs them far more than Encrypted does!
---
A keyring would be great. Save the lag for it you want to look for a key, not check how much gunpowder you have
---
Yes! Mr Fuzzy Ride and plushies!
---
The irony is that he probably was trying to do the daily level score quest or something and thought you were going to get that sweet exp before him, and so he went extra murder mode haha. Hey whatever works!
---
I just accepted that the game is still a mess and Quitted
---
Thats what I saw too! Its no longer useless! Not necessarily useFUL but still isn't quite as useless before xD
---
I have the shielded lining in my under armour im sure
---
you said "back to atoms" they used to have dailys that gave atoms?
---
Haha...yeah.   I remember seeing my first Super Mutant.   It was in Fallout 3.    Luckily he was across the river.    We traded shots for a long time.    So long that i named him George.   RIP George.
---
Really? My friend runs a fixer stealth build dont know his weapon buffs but he wasn't able to do any increased damage at all to earl. The wendigos kept attacking him even when it was saying hidden then after they would attack him it would go into danger.
---
I got a Junkies FFR 90 50 cal yesterday. Pretty good roll, I won't use it but it's excellent trade fodder.
---
these are decent changes but let's see more fixes!
---
I bought mine at vault 79, all three were there, didn't have to buy them separately. So I just got shielded.
---
Unless something has bugged out in the last couple weeks, yes, you can
---
First two bullion purchases I made were SS underarmor and shielded lining for same.
---
I'll tell my friend that. But were more concerned on doing massive amounts of damage through either dps or critical
---
Now I just blast the doom theme at full volume and charge
---
request a refund for it on the support site. This will most likely be fixed in the next patch
---
Before Wastelanders and Seasons (The Legendary Run), dailies and weeklies mostly gave Atoms.
---
And they have had them in previous fallouts. I don’t get it
---
Oh, shit. So that's what is happening to me. Too much frustration in 76. I am not only losing my hair but I am also shrinking.
---
You ever play Defiance 2050? Yea, it should be like that
---
the ash piles kill my game more so than meat piles do
---
Its likely you are in a public group and someone is sharing stranger things
---
SPOILERS
---
Really sad I've had to retire my Tesla, but making fields of pixelated squares and dropping FPS to power point is a pretty OP PvP weapon.
---
I went into Wastelanders thinking the settlers would be like Responders.  Disappointed to find the settlers were more like Raiders, and the Raiders were rather tame.  It just wasn’t at all what I was expecting.
---
Like a legendary and 500 caps happened to me last night don’t stress it.
---
No problem at all!
---
Picked up the Silver Shroud plushie as well as the Mr. Fuzzy ride.  May get the other plushies throughout the week just to have them.
---
plans can be found in some player vendors and in treasure map locations.
---
Personally, I had a full set of Excavator and T51 before I found all the T45 parts.
---
Is shielded the best one?
---
Just don't look under the hood.
---
&gt;No doubt, it's a good scam. This dude will end up with better gear by making one "poor little me" post than I have found in 3 months of legit playing 😅 and all he had to do was create a new account and put lots of sad faces. oh well 
---
Do you believe the "scam" is occurring through direct messages? I am confused by your assertion as it seems that OP has actually refused to accept donations. I would have offered to help as well if I had not read those replies first.
---
Welp, there goes my atoms
---
Yay more plushies!
---
Tried asking for a reimbursement of atoms when it happened to me. I had to spend atoms for when my weeklies auto-completed and the agent outright refused and closed my ticket. Was a big middle finger from the service agent. He even mentioned the exact atom amount I spent on the board but said they wouldn't be reimbursing my account and then closed my ticket. Pissed me off soooo much.
---
You and me both
---
Agreed. Lock it to 50 and above.
---
If you cant kill this boy solo, then you likely dont even meet your own criteria of being competent enough to play the event.
---
Big Awkward.
---
Atom shop update for those just waiting for the new season to start
---
Yeah they work the same! Gauss is also Ballistic too. It's an Energy Weapon that fires Ballistic Rounds.
---
Awesome thanks!
---
This should also be a thing on consoles. Eso has it so why not
---
Cool, good to know, thank you.
---
It's the top tier for all underarmor, usually you have to already have the others before getting that one
---
never seen that top line before - \[set bonus 5/5\] ....
---
Bro a deathclaw leather Armor skin with a deathclaw hood and a light in one of its eyes
---
Someone told me...... karma's a bitch
---
Yeah that's not bad, definitely could get a good amount of caps in your vendor, somebody bought my junkies +10/ 90rw fixer for 10k when I got it from the legendary vendor
---
Might be a one off. Think there’s certain places that are better to stay hidden than others. I had to find the right spot, but once I did I was hidden as long as there weren’t any spawns after me
---
Thanks. Saved me some atoms!
---
Whose dick do I have to suck to get a basic laugh emote? 😔
---
Thats what luck of the draw is for
---
OMG, that's too funny.    I wish there was an easier way to communicate.   I cared none for the legendary...not that it wouldn't have been nice... But i think your right.   He was there for other purposes, it just played so well into the game I was playing.
---
Aye. Failed one before. Earle had like 2% health left and time ran out. 2 of the players there were 20 and 28 and they spent most of the game hiding.
---
Not sure I understand the problem.
---
PC
---
And how should that work?
---
Omg yes
---
I think it's incredibly limiting that you can only do it to a colossus.
---
once the desire fades, but the masks still aren't found in a readily available fashion, then it will finally be the rare item we all expect hah
---
You will know when you find them
---
hah fine keep your beard on
---
24 for head shot. Think it was 15 for body. Somewhere around there. That mofo is tough.
---
Awe cool thats not so bad. I gues the watch is a firt time event reward and went to my inventory. I was thinking id have to redo it just for that little thing.
---
No problem! Do you have one? They're absolute beasts!
---
I saw he/she may have declined but this seems entirely off. Have you looked at their profile? Please let me know.
---
I did the event for the first time last night (Xbox) my frames were so laggy for the whole 20 minute fight when I got done I sent a text to my cousin to tell him we beat it and it looked like my thumbs were typing at 120fps.
---
I got the mask my 8th run I think
---
*Finds a way to reliably do this and gets infinite score*
---
oh, that game used to scare the hell out of me.    I had Doom64.   Still do actually...But i used to play really late at night.  Those corridors still give me waking nightmares. 🥺
---
Great, good to know about the time I will have to get ready, and damn, that sucks when so close to getting it done... 2%, sounds definitely doable though - but for how long will Bloodied be able to win though?  The bloody nerf is supposedly coming, and some user on here made a whole post about how this is a good thing.... (facepalm) when I read it, double facepalm after seeing all the "likes" on his post.  Beth changing anything... is almost never a good thing. lol
---
But.. We have a sorry emote?
---
you can do pretty much everything solo. I did the original main questlines solo, as well as the WL vault raid.  Entered a nuke zone created by someone else to complete scorched earth.
---
THere are a few events where it may take several other players to successfully complete (scorched earth, project paradise, etc) , but you don't have to be teamed with them to get credit.
---
Since WL and public teams, you can join a team an never see the other team members.
---
You can create your own public team to suit your own purposes - people will join you for the bonuses.
---
They still have to fix the audio lag on consoles when doing events like these. It gets so bad to where you can’t hear your gun go off because it makes no sound. Makes you think. Huh Defiance 2050 had huge ass world boss fights...
---
What door?
---
Yeah why were Explosive Vents even in the game if they don't (and have never) work? For that matter, any PA leg mod other than Calibrated Shocks? Why don't Optimized Bracers work? What's the point in any Unarmed mod for PA anyway? 
---
They gave us X-01 helmet light plans but there are no plans for any other type of headlamp, only box mods found in the wild. Why weren't the other plans added when the Enclave vendor got X-01 plans?
---
Why can't I place an upper wall cabinet anywhere other than in a floor?
---
I like big boom boom
---
If Bethesda actually gave a proper sweep for weapon viability and balance, the way it should be is that even the weakest semi-automatic receiver and other single-shot rifle receiver *should still be stronger than all automatic receivers*.  
---
They shouldn't be close in damage like they are now, semi-auto should just have significantly higher damage output otherwise there's no advantage to it.
---
Gee, I clear out all the 45 I can find.
---
Yep. I feel like if the event had a drop that was something everyone would want it would be better because the reward would be worth it. Too bad tho.
---
Well if you know any hidding spots I'd love to know them, I'm pretty stocked on stims so if your on xbox I'm gladly able to share stims for knowledge.
---
The same way it does now, but without weapons becoming obsolete as you level up. High level players would still be stronger because of perk cards and SPECIAL
---
It seems so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
At least it went back to normal...
---
You sure? Mine doesn't seem to work even with the magic effect.
---
Wait... Where do I get the firefly jar?! :(
---
When I put the camp device right up against the edge of water to build on the water, it doesnt give me any room on the water to build. The outer limit thats on the water is really close to the shore.
---
r/pkoa are kinda brotherhood related, busy and good sized chapters on multiple platforms.
---
Super friendly too.
---
I like it!  The extra fast travel point and bottomless scrap box are very useful.
---
Grab a month, see what you think.
---
Ooof my bro is level 173 and he hasn’t even done that quest yet 😂
---
Yes!
---
Players have been suggesting this since the beta. The most we'll probably see is additional surfaces/shelves that we can add stuff to.
---
Glad I am not the only one who thinks this.  I literally stand around after each event to heat him say that.  Grahm loves his moo-moo so much.
---
There’s this game called DEFCON
---
**" Going forward, Treasure Hunter Mole Miners will now spawn in all regions of Appalachia "**
---
Uh...on Xbox, I was already running into them in the Mire, Forest, and Cranberry Bog. I guess PC players had them stuck in only the Ash Heap...?
---
yeah - I was a little insulted when she yelled at me and I had never launched one...
---
Does alot of 2mm ec ammo count? :P
---
1 heavy gun can run 20 pounds and almost 30 fully modded. IMO pack rat isn't really worthwhile unless you are a rifle build since they don't have a weight reduction perk. If you are carrying 3 or 4 heavy guns the gain is much better on bear arms.
---
I got a q/10/ms harpoon gun
---
It would be awesome to see the Ohio River Raiders.
---
I agree.  With the live game right now, I just get so much satisfaction from popping off heads with a sniper rifle.  A .50 sniper rifle should kill all standard humanoid enemies with one headshot.  I’m ok with two on a lvl100 mutant, but a 75 should go down with a min/max bloody sniper build.
---
We need more plushies the size of the sheep squatch!
---
Please, no worries at all! Thanks so much! I'm very intimidated by the complexity of this service after I've poked around a bit lol, but I'll give it a try!
---
Just like you'd think a combat armor helmet with a headlamp attached would actually utilize the headlamp. Fallout 4 modders made that thing work years ago!
---
Noice! Cheers!
---
So all weapons would be as strong as level 1 variants?
---
Yeah it was definitely a risk
---
PTS means they're "testing" the event. They don't get to keep the stuff and, supposedly, once it's tested and fixed, they'll roll this version out of the event out to us...meaning regular PC players, Xbox, and PlayStation.
---
Settle down, Beavis.
---
Nah it was just lag but then again the people I went in with were using explosive .50 cals and such. While I was using an Ultracite gauss mini. So Ig I contributed to the lag
---
Sounds like utter bullshit. Man. How much did you spend?
---
Maybe Earl is bloodied as it seems to get harder to do damage the lower its health.
---
Yeah I feel they are just getting lazy at this point. Also 3rd month now and still not a single 1st extra?!
---
Are you placing the camp module for the first time in this area or are you in building mode and moving the module?
---
I could be very wrong but I dont believe the Tenderizer has a plan for it. The three mods do have plans though.
---
Gotcha. Guessing that's a river or a big lake? If so, then I don't think there's a way around it. A smaller pond works fine to put on water.
---
Placing it for the first time in the area
---
In the new Meat Week event you can get a plan for it.
---
august was the rug and bed, they didn't put it in the fallout 1st section.
---
I only carry one heavy gun.  On the other hand, I often carry a ton of scrap, namely steel while I'm working on other ammo materials.
---
600 atoms. By the weeklies and dailies auto-completing I lost out on four board spaces near the end, was something like 8500 points lost.
---
Teach me your ways.
---
It does have a plan! Rarest drop o’ the event tho with a sparkling 2%- good luck finding a copy OP
---
More weird shit from the people who are apparently obsessed with the peripheral themes and visuals of the Fallout IP.
---
there is a difference between "magic" guns and hacked guns
---
This is like looking forward in time to tonight when I finally have time to try this event, all my character has going for him is his unarmed perks. At least I have the stealth suit now
---
I’m on PS4
---
I'd make it all level 50 (numbers-wise) so it wouldn't screw with the current builds
---
Or just change it to atoms for everyone one you’re finished?
---
Oh really? I didn’t know other games let you launch nukes even though it’s such a cool concept in general
---
Tis also why I seldom play multiplayer at all. 76 is the first time I've played online since Left 4 Dead, and even then I only played on a buddy's private server. 
---
I had him install the text chat mod so I could text chat to him while he voiced back to me.
---
it never was taken seriously in the first place
---
So it’s not like what you’re thinking. You see a overview of the global and you work up to nuking other nations(players)
---
WV most likely got plenty of indirect radiation damage.  We see the consequences of this, of course.

---
Oh and does anyone know where the chest of loot is, that I've heard about?
---
XD great show that one but those teeth
---
Of course the sale ends the day before I get my FO1st atoms. Sneaky sneaky Bethesda. Pushing that FOMO.
---
Oh that’s really cool! I’m guessing it’s a last gen game?
---
I have a spare copy of the plan. Also got the recipe for the Tato Salad. ☺️
---
createbeauty on PS4
---
Its been a while, but I got motion assist servos and optimized bracers from a bot vendor in WS.  
---
There are a couple that only drop from SBQ. IIRC,  (at minimum) Targeting HUD and Calibrated shocks
---
Even earlier it’s on pc but definitely something that may peak your interest
---
There's nothing of value in the atom shop. I don't know why people say Bethesda are after our money when they don't put anything in it to spend our... OMG PLUSHIE ALIEN AND OMG HOLY COW TAKE MY ATOMS ALL OF THEM NOW!!! 1!1!
---
I certainly hope so, because that is my main's entire loadout
---
Name your price.
---
It's probably a safe way of keeping the server from crashing especially if everyone is dying and respawning
---
I can make my own junk piles but what I would like, ney, love to see are pre-furnished shelves. and dressers.  Some with books, some with food, some with random wasteland junk.  I don't want to pick and choose what goes on them because that would just eat away at the already limited budget. Just give me shelves with shit already on them.  Why would Bethesda ever think anyone would want empty shelves in their camps.
---
Why even make this event able to have under 8 people? im with high levels that i guess arent dupers or using god weapons and we are not doing anything. I find it kind of silly we need god weapons or dupers to even have a chance at this event. We have people at the top idling at ONLY a couple of deaths. So many people let the wendigos run around, i can only pray for the others guys around the corner when the tunnel visioned people bring a group of 20 wendigo to the over side. i doubt this game has the community to pull this even off with randos atleast 50% of the time. So many wasted nukes now i can see it! Doesnt matter if im "good" at the event, im not a god, i dont use god weapons and never will, it needs teamwork with a little bit of thinking ..... guess we just dont have it!
---
Still no fix for the bugged main quests? Really?
---
That would make the game to easy for low level players.
---
If you have a pal you can take turns refreshing the inventory. so one stays while the other swaps to an alt and checks and then swaps back and then the other goes.
---
I want loot that is actually a grind, not something that takes literally over 250 days to get everything because there's a daily limit of gold I can get. That's just dumb.
---
Oh I’ll have to check it out. Thanks man!
---
Is it still 10% dmg boost?
---
I used to think so too, but now I realize that it's going to only harm the game in the long run as more and more places end up nuked on a regular basis.   
---
Canonically it's kind of a nightmare that the devs are even promoting nuking things as the answer to solving problems in a world that has been utterly destroyed by these weapons.   
---
Nuclear experts have even come out against the game for promoting these ethics IRL.   
---
 [https://www.vice.com/en\_us/article/zm9549/nuclear-war-experts-are-horrified-by-fallout-76](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zm9549/nuclear-war-experts-are-horrified-by-fallout-76)
---
Yea and it was amazing......
---
Nice work.
---
I have an AA fire rate the fixer with full commando/stealth card sets and in the Chinese Stealth Armor...I was dripping health off of him like crazy.  He couldn't get a lock on me and I remained in caution the entire time. A group of dudes with the same loadout would put poor Earl down with haste.
---
Most of the named Raiders are actually pretty decent people. Meg's a hardass, but it's actually a major plot point of the questline of how soft she is. Lou is literally just a depressed guy. Axel's a lovesick puppy with a martyr complex. Creed's a wuss trying to protect his sister. Johnny's a conman, but at the end of his arc he shows he's only so because of his own damage and you help him overcome that. Gail and Ra-ra are... well, Gail and Ra-ra. Even Ae-ri, Rocksy, Wren, and Weasel seem like decent folk who just want to make sure the group doesn't fall apart.
---
Spaghetti code.
---
The expectation is that certain events will not have the same "leveling" as the rest of the world. I figure that will especially be true for a Colossal Problem, since it's an instanced interior.
---
That's kinda what they'll do with One Wasteland.
---
OR OR OR Just take out the game board completely and give us atoms again
---
It's been bugged since Patch 21.
---
You say you are not using exploits, but you're all full rads bloodied...
---
Pretty common.
---
I do! I’m not sure what the main star is but I’ve crafted a ton trying to get a bloodied and I know a decent amount had some magic effects. But I also have a magic quad DB so I might just stick with that lol
---
Red is the color, of death and blood
---
DEATH AND BLOOD
---
If you kill Hu-Man you can join our club
---
KILLING HU-MAN, MEANS JOIN THE CLUB
---
It's already fixed on PTS I think
---
Never had it, probably never gonna get it, 4 different characters all above lvl 150, been playing the game since one month after if was released and took breaks here and there, your pretty much paying extra for cosmetics and stash space when you can have mules and get cool stuff from nuclear winter, or get stuff with just atoms for cosmetics and buy op gear off of players instead, don't buy into the new pay to win nature of video games that's just what they want you to do!
---
Sounds like you need to do more dps, the event isn't anywhere near so tightly tuned that two level 30s will scuttle the attempt.
---
I actually got cucked by staying in too long, I always just stay in and loot for screws. Instead last time I got one shot by a wendigo (bloodied) and went down. The event ended and it kicked me out of the instance, it loaded me outside already dead and somebody picked up my 200 screws lol.
---
I'm glad someone's having fun...
---
When I took the long route down the hospital and didn't jump through the hole did this:
---
1. Closed the door going into the room behind me
---
2. Read all of the logs on the terminal, every single one
---
3. Analyzed the file
---
4. Put the fuse in
---
5. Quest step done
---
I have just fast traveled to the mine from inside and still got the event rewards. Worked the 3 times I did it.
---
Also picking up somones loot that isnt in your party should lead to a wanted level.
---
Ty
---
Furious Plasma Pistol +10DWA &amp; Less VATS
---
Since I like Plasma weapons, this one won't get scripped.
---
Imagine buying photomode frames.
---
Man...honestly its going to suck.insert disc it will install so 50gig or so then it will update.and we are about 20 patches in to the game.not sure exactly on size but at least 50 gigs
---
She doesent know she is just an AI.
---
I think there's a workaround where you can put a painting on the wall first, then put the board on top of that
---
Yeaa they do that.
---
No, it is like a 15-20% drop. 
---
Are they traceable? People probably want them.
---
One wasteland is just a bandaid. Even with one wasteland there's no way you should ever expect a person that is level 20 do to as much damage or have better gear than someone level 50. Same at 50 and 100 150 etc. 
---
Level cap would still help with or without one wasteland
---
Let me know how that goes cause he was a madman but he was Persistent
---
Yeah when someone posted last time I joined and got that and then I left so they could come back and they got long coat. Guess next time I’m posting
---
Are you using a magic shotgun or rocking 15% blocking on any armor?
---
All they did was add gold trim to the red set that came in the Contemporary Bundle, which I already own.
---
Take it on a date first.
---
I think the nerf is going to do zero to stop people like this, the only people its going to fuck are noobs that dont know what builds are. Unless youre braindead youre going to be stacking damage cards, and the added levels on enemies is just going to make them harder to kill as well.
---
Oh I see, thanks. What does traceable mean?
---
i'd rather have a working game
---
Why? Are you some sort of water per-person
---
Not really cus One Wasteland causes mobs to become your level for you while for a level 100 the mob will be the highest level it can be.  
---
As in, lowest level SB is 50 so a level 1 player is going to be doing damage as if he was shooting a lvl 50 one and I think 80 is max on them so a level 60 player will be fighiting a level 80 SB while they're both fighting the same enemy
---
It's always something with this game
---
It means I cant spell "trade-able" :)
---
I have about 5-7 of each other plan except the tenderizer plan, I've even got flamers and other plans like that which share the same drop percentage.
---
where did you get that number from? unless you mean like. everything. as in everything that bullion can buy. because that's just being silly.
---
They but we probably aren't gonna get that soooooooooooo maybe some new weapon and armor skins??
---
Yea that happens with me and the settler forager. I don't bother with him anymore.
---
&gt;I saw he/she may have declined but this seems entirely off. Have you looked at their profile? Please let me know. 
---
You are correct that a new account and single post are suspect. However, this alone is not "proof" and I would not necessarily use such strong language as other comments in decrying the OP's question.
---
I am fairly new to this subreddit and have read multiple posts from other users lauding the Fallout 76 community. On the other "hand", comments such as [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iggbgf/a_lvl_340_told_me_how_to_make_a_storage_box_but/g2tlxk4) and [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iggbgf/a_lvl_340_told_me_how_to_make_a_storage_box_but/g2tm97e) are particularly discouraging for me to read as a newer player myself, especially when directed toward a seeming child.
---
SAVE UR ATOMS
---
im using a bloodied combat shotgun 2 star with limb damage and using the chinese stealth armor. Bloodied shotgun/stealth
---
Why though? I use my phone to type in games on the Xbox and it works flawlessly.
---
I had a wonderful herd of these bastards screeching and swatting. Had to switch up to the prime fifty, but that was fun. I could not accurately count them, 10 to 15 minimum.
---
"Unprovoked attacks on workshops"
---
Workshops are PvP zones. If you're in one, it's not unprovoked.
---
Haha yeah they are. Do you know how much they're worth roughly? I'm on Xbox if that makes a difference
---
Foreal I feel this, always some minor bugs that make a big difference. Yet I have to say this event makes it feel like an MMO more so and the specific loot drops are awesome!!! I'm stoked about it and I hope everyone else is too.
---
I finished today too, and the reward is sweet freedom.
---
Yea I have never been this lucky. I had to trade for the Brahmin grill but I got everything I wanted. That tenderizer plan is tough to get.
---
I am sorry, I dont. They are new though, and that is always enticing for people. Toss it up with a good price and it will probably sell quick.
---
I want pirate fights!
---
The boss itself isnt even that bad its the AoEs and the wendigo swarms that get you
---
I've come to the conclusion that if my first, even second shot misses, re-vats, hits every time.
---
First fight i did against him was like he was walking on a invisible platform. But we where able to still shoot and kill him and body fell to the floor. When it first happened I said oh crap he’s going to go in the ceiling and disappear: thank god he didn’t I’m also on Xbox
---
how is being bloodied an exploit? :S
---
I just can't understand how after two years they can't so much as put in a weapon skin without making a total pig's breakfast of it :(
---
Hmmmm....
---
Hadn't considered that. If it is indeed genuine then i suppose i judged too quickly. It's sad because this sort of thing does happen. Ill mosey outta here but I didnt mean to use "strong language". As far as decrying without proof.... Meh. It's one of those situations i feel happy enough to assume. No ill will, just dont buy it.
---
Hope you meet kindness in wv. Chaio
---
Not entirely true. I can beat people with a junkie's handmade (not legacy) and a bare bones set of assassin's sentinel.
---
Will do, thank you so much :)
---
Alas, there goes a potential deal...
---
Limb damage, vats chance and bashing damage all produce the “magical” effect that you are experiencing.  Same thing with heavies.  Try using a bloodied shotgun with a different perk and those issues will likely stop.  You don’t even need to run a shotgun build for the magic shotguns to one tap.  Junkies, Medics and one other also cause the effect.  Just saying.
---
It happened to us while he was walking across that concrete platform in the middle of the room. Not sure if that has anything to do with it or just a coincidence.
---
To be entirely honest, it depends on your build and how you're playing the game. If you want to add me on Discord or whatever I'd be happy to take a look at it and give helpful advice.
---
Use the search function or Google ffs this question is asked like 200 times a week.
---
Looks like I get to keep my atoms this week
---
Yup, it's my favourite Weapon at the moment. Needs to be in VATs. What rolls do you have?
---
You're right! Its not gonna happen
---
JFC.    
---
How was that not caught?   
---
Oh .. right.
---
It's been available since last Tuesday on PC.  Can't speak for consoles.  I think they got them a day or two ago?
---
Yea it makes sense, even though they could just give SB more stats (in that example).
---
But I can see that they use level as a visual tip that "you can't handle this enemy"
---
Yeah idk, he was doing this when he was near where you first drop in but he could’ve came over platform before that moment. That might be the cause
---
Right? The wiki only lists the ones that cost Atoms, these are all of (I think) the frames you unlock by exploring the map
---
VATs only.
---
This has happened a lot in the past. Which means they know bugs like this exist yet they still release skins without doing a test that takes 10\~ seconds to do.
---
So herd mentality does work in public teams? The info blurb for it says “the closer you are to teammates the higher the special” or something like that. So I thought you have to be physically close to your teammates to get the benefit. Hahahahaha.
---
Always store your junk. Do NOT walk into a PvP zone (i.e, a workshop) with junk on you.
---
Ok sorry
---
The DBs are very powerful!
---
They should just make it a standard that all Nukable events give repair kits.
---
If there's  anything i can help you with, regarding discord, let me know
---
My biggest concern is with weapons getting weaker as you level up. Since enemies will kinda level up with you
---
Ah, you are correct, didn't think of that one.
---
Thanks for solving our mystery :)
---
Nice I wanna try it sometime this week. I’m a bloodied commando also. I have a bloodied fixer. 250 dr while reloading and 50 more critical damage. Still gets job done. I don’t have it prime tho. Did you have your weapon primed?
---
The whole game is bugged
---
Yes, everything that bullion can buy. The game is already a grind with only getting like 2-3 treasury notes per event, nobody needs the daily cap limit. That isn't adding to the grind, that's just halting it.
---
I die literally every time and I always still get event rewards. I just stay down there killing windigos until I die lol
---
I beat you by a few, had everything except repeatable weekly and all dailies auto complete early on. It wasnt fun.
---
It's not fun if you die by one
---
I can imagine. It seems like the last two patches have made the game a bit more unstable than usual. Hopefully the powers that be at Bethesda can address the issue sooner rather than later.
---
I would personally recommend you the Free States outfits, especially Survivalist.
---
Find a spot IN the water to place your CAMP, either a shallow spot or some debris. If you place it on the shore you only get roughly half the build area.
---
Are u PvPing against legacy users?
---
I’ve never been a fan of the run. The rewards are cool and all, but they take you away from just playing the game. I am looking forward to a little break, myself.
---
Then yeah, it seems to be a legit drop. They can drop from events, be found in robot vendors, and I believe even as NPC loot. Not sure about world spawns or containers. Just be wary that buying one from players is likely duped, and also definitely exploited if it's level 1 or 5 bought from a player
---
It's fucking hilarious. Especially when y'all curse us out for it.
---
Oof, brutal.
---
Had a level 500 hide today .. but I do agree maybe restrict it people who are able to launch a nuke
---
That’s definitely unfortunate, especially considering this is the largest content drop we’ve gotten in a while.
---
No worries, grinded a little and completed it week before last.
---
Its meg's outfit with the tire arm
---
I've tried soloing him but he just regens his health. Is there something that triggers that or is that just from not doing sustained damage? Also is the screeching head the best target for maximum dps?
---
Looks like I'm buying a bundle after work!  Thanks again for posting as always!
---
try to do this on a public server ... there is always a power armor guy who is ruining your sneak damage ;)
---
Where you spawn when you enter the event, look left. 
---
Red chest. 
---
Like 15 ft away from the holotape you get for Mags.
---
If you have a jetpack you can go back up the hole you dropped down into Earles lair, significantly shorter than running.
---
Im gonna try it with marsupial tonight and see if it works using the platforms.
---
I have, yes. They're not the immortal bastards you think they are.
---
The game still isn't ready to be out of BETA, is it?
---
Damn.
---
Hardcore ones are.  They spam their duped nuka quantum’s.
---
Do you have to remember Bethesda didn't make those weapons, obsidian did i think, like I'm pretty sure if obsidian wasn't involved with Fallout New Vegas it would just be the same type of guns in Fallout 3
---
I wish I was surprised.
---
Ever figure out a way that you don't have to do this every single time?
---
I wish there was junkie. Oh well....
---
Hahahaha, nope
---
I used an unprimed b3325 fixer, took around 10 minutes with only a couple of chem buffs. It’s really worth trying on your own, I’d recommend circling around the main area- just keeping on the move to avoid the spitting attacks 👍.
---
Today I played around with it the pure way...and then some. I took off Barbarian, Evasive, and Ironclad as well as the Scaly Skin &amp; Grounded mutations. Wore underarmor with zero stats to make my DR at "0". Then I put on my high capacity backpack which put my DR in the negative but didn't show a number at all. With 1 in perception I got my Berserker Fixer to show 87 damage. What was really cool is the enemies could not see me, even up close, and was shooting back no where near me. West Tek was easier than ever. Once I killed one, several would raise their weapons and then put them away as if I wasn't there. This is a great sneak build but the damage needs a buff. It felt more like 57 damage per shot, not 87, but they couldn't find me to retaliate.

---
Look up Angry Turtle's YouTube channel. He has several videos on magic weapons / effects.
---
For example, if you have an Instigating, Junkie's, or Stalker's  minigun with the accelerated barrel mod, you have a magic weapon that can due more damage than intended.
---
How did you die that many times?
---
I die 0 times unless I get feared into the drill.
---
Lvl160. Furious fast 2hander, nonPA, full hp vanguard. About 600 DR/ER.
---
Only thing I change during fight is remove martial artist and swap in blocker.
---
Now my alt, a lvl60 bloodied archer dies when sneezed on. 
---
So it seems like this event is meant to punch low hp builds a bit harder.
---
That's not bad, if you wanna buy my instagating 3* +10dm while aiming I may sell it for cheap i only use plasma gats sometimes when I find cores
---
for meat week it is faster to just go to vault 76 and run down the hill than it is to fast travel to a teammate actually at the event which for some reason spawns you way down past the bootleggers shack
---
Drugs are bad kids stay away from them....
---
The majority, if not all, of the good items in trading networks are duped. So I'm not sure what your point is here.
---
I got the wendigo rug
---
I was thinking... Free.
---
I don't even use the photo frame, if I wanted to be a photographer in the Wasteland I would move to Detroit
---
That's the point of one wasteland though.  Proportionally, the lower level person should be similar to a similarly geared higher level person.  The higher level person should be more fine tuned and with more options in their toolbox.
---
So, the low level person is a blunt hammer, but the higher level person is a multitool.  Low level person just keeps shooting that pipe pistol for even, constant damage, while the higher level is clearing adds, disabling the boss, using perks to buff the team.
---
It's a big difference, but, in one wasteland, I would hope the lower level should be able to contribute much more meaningfully than today.
---
Yeah that’s what always killed me was the dumb spit attack. Lol I will have to stock up on psycho buffs and stuff. Normally have a lot but rarely don’t use them
---
I just finished it. Seems like they finally patched it.
---
That works as well. I will message you when I leave work.
---
That's exactly how it should work. As you level you get tougher enemies and better gear to better handle the tougher enemies. That's how it works in every game with a leveling system. 
---
It's a gear grind to keep you playing for better gear.
---
Oh you mean murmgh. By far my favorite character
---
It's a new mutation added with the new raid boss event.
---
haha yeah, one of the many reasons we ran it on Private ^^
---
Furious swing speed plus one strength Chinese Officer sword is probably the best thing I've seen so far
---
Man adding prefixes to enemies would be a sick idea. *legendary nocturnal super mutant behemoth* legendary bolstering sheepsquatch*
---
that's odd, are you dying during this? he should full health heal once only when he mutates
---
Instigating &amp; Stalkers. Medics was debunked. ;)
---
It's one of the new plans that's semi rare?
---
Yeah plans Im always willing to grind for I just don't know which ones they have released yet
---
I didn’t see it either either with the other SS under armor mods. It was toward the bottom of the list. Then I seen it for I think 200 or 250 GB and I bought it.
---
LOOT AND RUN! LOOT AND RUN!
---
Plenty of time.
---
Forget about escaping - when the mine collapses the game just places you outside.
---
And 500 rounds of whatever weapon you killed it with
---
Does no one loot the wendigos they shoot?
---
I did a couple last night, went into the 2nd one with 150 ish .45, because I space cadeted and forgot to restock.
---
Got under 50 and I remembered about the new ammo system. Started looting wendigos and pretty quick im back up over 500 and never stopped shooting.
---
And there are benches where you load into the event for easy repairing. Maybe even useable mid fight if you have marsupial or a jetpack, I didnt get a chance last night to verify if you can go back up the hole you fall down into earles lair.
---
Do they all have the same effects?
---
Do them legs go all the way up?
---
You choose to play a videogame with random strangers on the Internet, yet you also want to control these strangers. I've always felt this is a really odd mindset.
---
Can you spare another maybe?
---
Really would appreciate it, anything you searching for maybe?
---
On ps4.
---
Shotmasta31
---
You see where I'm going with the idea...weapons and builds matched with subcategories of enemies. There are legendary weapons in the game optimized for certain enemies but nothing like what you mentioned.
---
It was frustrating when I did die because his health would regen but staying on the move solved that, would also advise using super stims to help with the poison damage. I’d like to get a stealth commando team together to take the bitch Earle down :D
---
First one I dropped, I just brushed up against the mine, no spawn. Check, lesson learned, (to teammates- ok guys you can stop laughing at me now...)
---
We really need some bog/mire "overgrown" themed camp sets to go with the fireflies a little better.
---
Basically building segments wrapped in moss and leaves and vines.
---
Like mothman stuff, but living plants instead of lumber/logs
---
Find junkie sheepsquatch, kill junkie sheepsquatch, loot that fucker for a mountain of chems.
---
I got 300 hours out of the game and I feel like I've done everything
---
Because the “raiders” we see at crater aren’t really raiders. Sure they look like them and have the decor, but they sure as hell don’t act like them. If they wanted to they could easy destroy foundation and push the settlers out of Appalachia, or just raid for everything they need, but they don’t. We see them scavenging for materials at a large piece of broken space station west of crater, we see them growing crops. They might be shitty people but they don’t get off to causing misery to those around them, like actual raiders or blood eagles.
---
From what I've seen on the market sub they really arnt worth much. None if the cursed weapons are since they have such a high drop rate
---
That, the heads on a pike, and maybe the guts pile. I really dont know about that one.
---
I think there are a whole lot of unrealistic people out there.
---
You need a private lobby.   Find someone with fallout first.   If you were on PS4, I could help ya out
---
"Its a big difference" that's literally the point though.. 
---
They would still contribute. It would just be a lot, lot less than someone higher level/better geared. Hence the level cap suggestion.
---
Delusions caused by people wishing they did more damage
---
Generally speaking, yes. I don't really use buffs, chems or whatever. Unless I'm fighting SBQ or Earle. It can be kind of expensive to have to run constant buffs
---
Same don’t use anything
---
If they classify wendigos as "human" then a full set of assassin's could be useful against Earle. Currently wendigos are not classified as anything regarding the legendary prefixes.
---
One thing you can do is ask a high level player to craft one for you. I love doing that for new players.
---
It's using the radiation mechanic in a way it wasn't intended to abuse the bloodied legendary prefix damage bonus.   
---
It's just so commonplace these days that everyone seems to have forgotten that this wasn't how the game was intended to be played.
---
Poorly coded legendary perks on weapons and armor.
---
I’m down I’m on Xbox if youre
---
Chems are perfectly fine, in my estimation - they are a physical item that grants a temporary buff.
---
I don't use any buffs. But do use mutations
---
I don't want atoms.  I know why they did the whole thing to begin with.  Something less invasive to their profit margins like caps be ideal.
---
I was the same till  I used the lamp on it. Can see loads better in the dark now.
---
Brace for downvotes. There are a lot of people saying he is too spongy but to those people I say, adapt and overcome. A lot of people are running quality of life perks which is fine but they can't have their cake and eat it. Please Todd, buff Earle
---
Wait until One Wasteland comes out.

---
They're classified as cryptids if you didn't know
---
In 1200 hours never used a magazine or bobble head, only used chems to go Junkies, pretty much every day most of my 1400 caps are from selling chems use 2 stimpacks for the first time in weeks fighting Earle today.
---
Yeah i know my regular shotgun works and one shots most things. My gauss on the other hand..i need to fully charge it.
---
I’d rather it give something different so you have a reason to nuke one over the other. Scrap kits maybe. I don’t personally find my guns break that fast on ACP? Maybe I’m just not remembering using repair kits mid fight.
---
Just found a workaround. Had to exit to the menu, reload into the world, exit to desktop, load back in, read all entries except the analyze blood, plaze the fuse, then Finaly go back and analyze the blood.
---
I support this idea with violence
---
I'm assuming they will be flattening this out similar to ESO.  If so, it won't be that big in standard content.  It'll be more noticable when people are pushing the envelope.
---
If Earle is like a dungeon run, then the event is like a group finder.  It should, hopefully, balance out later. Hopefully.
---
There are no special mechanics really.  The complaints are just about damage output.  I guess we'll have to wait and see.
---
200 times a week and yet you are still clicking into the posts? Wtf is wrong with you? Scroll to the post ffs
---
I don't have magic effects or bloodied and I get by just fine. Granted, I'm still not sure how bad the damage nerf is gonna be, but right now I'm able to hold my own quite well.
---
You can't have aa and furious on the same weapon....
---
I could have sworn I knew all the weapons, I guess not. Whats a "bloodied pole jock"? lol
---
Free range is mostly just annoying to solo but very doable if you have decent gear.  I have "soloed" it a ton of times.  
---
That is in quotes though because almost every single time there will be one person who watches the event on the map and waits to travel in once the icon is just about to the end destination so that they can tag the squatch....or just try to insta-kill the thing and screw you out of loot.  
---
It's great when you spend several minutes escorting Brahmin so that someone else can swoop in suddenly at the end.  I can only remember 3 instances where I truly did it solo.
---
He's plenty spongy for most non-hyper optimized damage builds too.
---
Don't be
---
Go to lucky he mine with the excavator pa set
---
I’m just stating that hardcore PvP spam their nuka quantum’s.
---
I got 3 yesterday after we traded lol
---
Yikes
---
I’ll pass that on, lots of people having this issue.   Thanks for the heads up
---
Assuming you mean it's not working on the PTS, correct?
---
Best wishes to you as well - I hope you and your loved ones are healthy!
---
Seems like they can have at least the following primary effects:
---
1) Bloodied
---
2) Executioner
---
3) Junkies
---
That because ~~either you or~~ someone in your group is using either a magic, legacy, exploit or hacked weapon. Earl is pretty tanky if you use legit gear and definitively doesn't die that soon.
---
Same to you friend.
---
yeah sorry i implied that since its not out yet
---
You could still put it on a non-legendary axe and display it if that’s all you wanted with it.
---
I got the backpack immediately after as well!
---
What perks are on the gun?
---
Smashed him up proper Bruv
---
Each weapon (harpoon gun, pick axe, shovel) has a set 3star combo.
---
Its all detailed in the link i updated with.
---
And the sheepsquatch just keeps shooting up like Jarod Leto in Requiem for a Dream through out the entire battle.
---
I'd say a bit more than that but I'm guessing as well.
---
It's not a case of hyper optimized. It's about fighting an end game boas without even attempting to optimize. It's supposed to be hard, and it gets easier if you move around a couple of perks and invest in some chems. That is why those perks/chems exist. I don't understand why people dig their heels in like this every time new end game content drops. I never see people saying "okay, this didn't work, let's try a different approach". Its always "Todd, please nerf this and please nerf that".
---
"Launching nukes for fun and loot" is such an about-face from every game in the series.  While I do appreciate a game that basically lets you create a new farming zone wherever you want, there had to have been a better way to go about it. 
---
Just off the top of my head, players could deploy a device that begins remediating a zone. In response, scorchbeasts emerge to resist is and irradiated flora bloom. 
---
Of course, by cleaning the earth you lose the "Wow cool nukes!" crowd that plays this game while missing the message of it entirely.
---
No exploit my arse. I nknow its not the point, but willing to bet all you have duped weapons.
---
I think it is not a bug but a way to ask us to buy atoms!!!
---
without this trick i could complete whitout buy any atoms!!
---
Hit all the gyms in the missile silos is a decent yield
---
Haha legacy go brrt
---
Exactly.
---
Just to give you a heads up the staff is broken
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iggr0e/greloks_staff_skin_removes_legendary_effects/?sort=confidence
---
Lol, now that's how the fellas from my neighborhood get it done!! Great story, lol.
---
And the prison yard in toxic valley
---
Two Shot has a strange calculation where it's figuring out the damage for two individual bullets. If you have other bonuses for low health (Nerd Rage, Emergency Protocols, etc.), they're getting factored into both shots, then added together.
---
In practice, however, you'll still probably do more damage with the Bloodied against anything Armored.
---
I hope it gets fixed because it was the Perk I was looking forward to the most.
---
Grognak Axe skins are cursed.  The Stanley skin was also broken a few patches ago.
---
It's some shit like that I don't fully know I'll tell you rn when I log back on tho bb kiss me before you call me out on my bullshit next time
---
Charleston firestation has a bit of lead, finds gyms and lucky hole mine
---
but who wants to buy every single item? nobody does. i imagine some people will because why not. I got what i wanted in what i felt was a very reasonable amount of time (SS armour and mods, gauss shotgun and mods, ammo maker). Not many games let you get endgame items this way. In fact i think it's a great way of letting people get endgame stuff. No random chance to get something after completing a hard raid which you can only get loot from once a week.
---
Yeah fighting the Queen it kind of made sense.
---
But A Colossal Problem? No, that shit’s fucked. I made a post about it already.
---
Exactly
---
Your broken gun is having a slight impact on rubber banding.
---
same I was hoping to test how viable it would be with a stealthy heavy gun for my heavy gun build
---
I use Pscyho when doing Uranium Fever
---
Foward your gamertag to Bathesda and request they make the game harder "just" for you.
---
A mounted Gatling gun on wheels like they had in civil war era and a mounted broadsider 🤤
---
Yea it is stupid how it's only 8 man event ,like why can't it be like the scorched queen
---
It would make more sense given the context of the game to be cleaning things up.   
---
I totally dig the remediation zone idea.
---
I have the same issue. I tried the work around, no luck. I'm on XB1. 
---
I've noticed other items unable to attach to walks as well; start lights, display weapon boards.
---
Nah, I uninstalled it, trash game anyway lol. It's the only game that gave me problems on gamepass.
---
I had this happen to me trying to go to meat week and I didn’t get to the event in time and missed it
---
Maybe he's the chosen one prophecy says someone will continue playing this game and bring balance to the Wasteland....
---
Not many games let you get endgame items this way because they realize it's stupid. Oh goody I love sitting on 400 treasury notes and not being able to get the SS armor for another month, fun.
---
They can, they won't. They're lying. They 100% have complete control over any account and the items/attributes/resources associated with it. They might be lying by omission in that Customer Support can't do anything about it, but as a company/developer they are absolutely capable and just refusing to do so.
---
Brings up a whole resistance aspect which would also be awesome. Like... nocturnal legendaries have 2x dmg, 2x dr and 2x hp at night but then that’s all halfed during the day
---
Found it, excellent post.  
---
I would even argue that it doesn't make sense for the queen. Operation Touchdown showed us that using explosives just causes the scorchbeasts to spread. I'm not even convinced that the scorchbeast queen fight is canonical.
---
Play wise it seems the same.  It just has better, and level appropriate, loot now.
---
Either way people will bitch and moan.
---
 Nope
---
luck hole mine + excavator.
---
If you find all the deposits, you should walk (or waddle)  out with about 600 Lead ore, a good amount of crystal, and a few other goodies as well.
---
Congrats 👏 
---
I'm only 4 ranks behind you
---
I don’t really notice the low frame rate on Xbox even with a full instance but I don’t do the event another than the first few times because it’s bad
---
I’m not controlling anybody dude, I just said that it was an asshole move. Where am I “controlling” anybody? Way to skip over how it absolutely screws over all the people putting tons of resources in
---
No I didn't die during that run at all. I got him to about 1/2 health and then the next thing I noticed he was back up to full. I just bailed because I was wasting too much ammo and didn't come prepared (I actually fast traveled to my team expecting them there but I was alone). I was hitting the poison head not the screeching (which I noticed later critted), not sure if that made a difference.
---
Same here. We failed it cause we all got seizures lol
---
Be an actor, get hired to do a movie, have the director die at the beginning of filming, have another actor take over and then get captured by a gang of drug dealers, and then devise a plan to rescue him which includes dressing up in disguise as a farmer.
---
*gives you hug* "shh shhh its ok its ok"
---
We all have suffered in the Wasteland sadly....
---
It along with the backpack quest is why I stopped making alts.  Someone really got hurt by the DMV.  Show us on the doll where the bad DMV hurt you.  Cause man they captured it so well it made me mad.
---
I whill!
---
So I always play around 50% health, my armor is meant for stealth sniper since I have a full WWR armor. I got tanked between the spawns and the fire falling from the ceiling
---
I'll just leave this here....
---
https://youtu.be/MGniXDzyDHs
---
Ok so according to my calculations and the position of the north star and the wind blowing from east to west my sexy ass power fist has 50 percent limb rather than armor I have so many power fists on deck I fucked it up. Don't hit me papi.
---
Congrats man, enjoy a stress-free playtime for a few weeks.
---
I sell mine 5-10 caps each. It does pretty well.
---
This doesnt help there case at all for them actually testing anything.
---
Can't think of any humans that aren't 1-shot anyway.
---
It at least has some future potential though.  Maybe BoS will give us some boss mob humans.
---
they're b2525 fixers mate, when I bought mine I hardly went to the guy and said 'oi guvnor, you got video proof that dropped for you legit then?' Jog on with that nonsense xD
---
Yeah 4 is body, 6 is head for me.
---
I was able to do good PvP even before quantum spamming.
---
It is, hands down. It is an absolute flagrant use of something that should be considered horrific to all of our characters (nuclear weapons) to solve a problem that can absolutely be handled other ways (especially in mining-rich Appalachia)  
---
The ethical message it sends is terrible, and I really wish the people writing this content would take the subject matter more seriously.
---
Definitely it’s a tough thing to kill. Had a full double squad most 100+ and we still lost with him having 15%. The two 40s pulled their weight but it wasn’t enough.
---
HERES COMES THE PAIN TRAIN!
---
Still no damage adjustment for sniper rifles or hardened receivers.  I’m beginning to think that Rifleman will go the way of the dodo.
---
Nice.   I guess stimpacks and rad away are considered chems...and I use them...a lot...and disease cure too.    But I sell all others, psycho, buffouts, even bubblegum.
---
Exactly this. It’s fucking ridiculous
---
I haven't seen this glitch since the game came out lol good times
---
Heh, nerf incoming.  Turning 1 grenade into 10 with AE kills will be great.
---
The more proper term is "threshold" but "floor" is more easily understood by all ages/education levels.
---
Enjoy your stress-free playtime. I have like, 10 more ranks to go. *twitches*
---
Yea that big boy has a lot of armor. So technically ig lower numbers than the scorchbeast queen are probably normal.
---
I lost 10.000 S.C.O.R.E today, that makes me mad at Bethesda, mad at the game &amp; it signals  me that there's no point in logging in til next week! Good job, Beth.
---
... obviously I'm gonna do some dailies &amp; keep supporting Grahm's personal Christmas.
---
You can’t not fast travel to a non hostile player. What are you even crying about
---
I got enclave general privs at level 15, it’s too easy to be able to launch. Cap it at 50
---
Ah, that will be because he mutated mate, unless you kill them quickly enough when you get all legendary enemies below a certain health point they regen and you get the notification *x has mutated*
---
As a cannibal I think it's great. A fresh meal practically delivered right to my door, delicious.
---
haha....yeah i can totally see that.    That's the one mutation i'd like to have.    Maybe with my second character I'll try that.
---
mutations feel pretty essential imo
---
Lvl 20 shouldn't be doing it. They should be playing in the forest.  Everyone bitching about not being able to do everything on day one is killing it for everyone that's put almost two years into this game.
---
Yep
---
Bugged weapons that kill anything in seconds and make the game kind of pointless atm (imo). I haven't really logged on since they blew up in popularity (few months). It's feels like I'm playing some alpha of some broken game.
---
They also make the upcoming balance changes pointless. Hopefully this bug is fixed soon.
---
hit me up I'm on PS4 Mortis494 I can craft all PA sets and mods (that are trade-able) so if you need Ultracite, X01, Excav, T-series with shocks, jetpack/protocols whatever I can help. Prefer to trade for stable flux for it as I use it to add the mods. My vendors are usually stocked with calibrated shock legs as everyone loves the +100 carry weight...
---
Marsupial and speed demon are life tho
---
Nothing popping up at a glance, but now I'm curious, and may end up reviewing the notes and holotapes and whatnot tomorrow morning when I've got a bit of a wait before an appointment.
---
Ah, makes sense. Thanks.
---
Same. Most of my carry weight is taken up by weapons and goddamn radaway lmao
---
My friend and I, both 250+, got spawned in with a level 50, and five level 30’s and below. It was a shit show, we both wound up leaving because it was as if we were doing it alone and it was sucking up too many bullets. The server was full of 350+ players and they were all at the event, but we got screwed.
---
Do the rest of the Unstoppables as Plushies, Bethesda!!!!
---
Agreed.    And just like in "real life" chems come with a cost.
---
No worries dude :)
---
Pretty crazy workaround but at least it works!
---
Yeah really puts a damper on my play time now that my progress is pointless.
---
There are people that completed in the first week.  They would auto-complete next season on the first day.  Awful idea.
---
one word
---
Consoles
---
Everytime I check to see what’s weighing me down I’m like oh maybe it’s this 200 rad away lol
---
Even a single nuke launch has extremely long lasting negative implications for Appalachia. The longer we play this game the more absurd even acknowledging one is going to get.
---
I’ve done the event solo it’s not that hard but when you need the players to actually kill earle and a couple of level 10’s show up and hide in spawn the whole time and they waste place’s in the instance for useful players you can get pretty annoyed
---
I imagine there's a pipeline from the PTS players directly to Bethesda. You'll probably want to notify them in some way.
---
For real. For me it's a combination of radaway and diluted radaway. Tbh I'm almost at the point where I need to just drop a lot of it lol
---
This is at least partially incorrect. You can put mods on the small backpack. (I know that's not the point OP was asking, just being specific.)
---
Be cool to get some weapon skins for like. You know.. 99% of weapons players use.
---
If you use ultracite ammo you get in return ultracite ammo 100%
---
1 of his heads doesn't register double damage. I think it's the poisonous head. The other heads take double
---
yeah, I'm a sucker for the plushies... the orange vault boy plushie is tucked into a bundle of which I already own half the items, so I guess I'm never getting that one.
---
Black powder weapons are the sole reason why I'm a rifleman (and why the combat doesn't bore me to quitting). Bethesda does need to rebalance things so that high DAM low DPS weapons are better.
---
Is this an Xbox thing? Mine went up just fine on PS4. There is a problem when it comes to moving it. You have to store the wall then replace it.
---
It was a stupid and bad idea that last 50 times it was posted to this sub.  It still is.
---
All it would do is reward people who completed in the first week with huge amounts of atoms and piss everyone else off.  Then piss them all off even more as store prices get raised since the most active players have huge amounts of atoms hanging around.
---
Everything I’ve seen is to use the spoiler header on reddit. I’ll post it on the bethesda forums too so they can see it
---
get world of warcraft and check the bullshit it takes to get the endgame stuff in that. In a 25 man raid you have a 20% chance of getting loot (iirc) from a boss. And if you are lucky enough to get loot from a boss you have to be lucky again to get the thing you want as there's a loot pool. You can do that once a week. Once. Add in the hours you spend making a raid group and actually doing the raid you could spend easily 4-5 hours doing it. And WoW mythic raids aren't easy. And then there's stuff behind timegates and limits. And then there was the world bosses which i think had a 4 week cycle and you could loot them once for a chance to get some legendary gear. And even if you got some legendary gear there was no guarantee it would be the one you wanted. 
---
i think i had all the stuff i wanted in 5-6 weeks max. Which IMO is decent. 
---
but. you do you.
---
We're probably all aiming at the head area to increase per shop damage and because its a big target to miss.
---
Interesting idea though.
---
Cool. So now we can get an extra 10% damage against Blood Eagles.
---
Or we could just use any general damage effect.
---
Seriously, a step in the right direction, but Slayer effects need to give something like 100% increased damage since they're so narrow. It wouldn't even break PVP if Assassin's got that kind of buff since there's the damage cap. Then Slayer legendaries might actually see some use.
---
If even go so far as to say Earle is a better training boss than SBQ.
---
Simple mechanics.  He doesn't fly.  Teaches situational awareness.  Adds give ammo.  Repair where you respawn.  Good size team.  It's not bad really.
---
Just don't stand in the fire.  Kill the adds.  Shoot the boss.
---
They did bring it up in a Q&amp;A.  It's not on the "to-do" list ATM.   It's on the "Would be nice to do one day" list
---
His legs, always try to cripple his legs immediately so that he is stuck in one spot. Hopefully this will help.
---
Thanks I got a cursed bloodied 40power attack pick axe and two cursed harpoons both with bashing lol, as if having a bashing as an effect isn’t cursed enough.
---

---
If they aren’t a meta build it could be difficult for them and a couple low levels leeching off their boss fight is annoying
---
Stop focusing on quests and events. Explore the area that you're equipped for. Grind for XP and gear.
---
They are on Twitter as well.
---
Fires TWO grenades, so it does double damage.  Same with a TS missile launcher, etc - as long as its a true explosive (Demolitions Expert perk) firing weapon.
---
mutations are part of this world...as evidenced by all the other creatures that have mutated.   Why not humans...right?
---
Oh i see, so all cursed harpoons are the same then. Got two of them both have bashing as effect lol
---
Just beside the mine exit
---
So if you die after eral die you'll keep all your junk. Yes you miss a legendary and the caps. Just make sure to stay around the entrance  until you'll get the pup up that the event are done then you get the event rewards.
---
I don't run from the mine I just stay and collect screws and when the timer end you get teleported to the entrance. I miss out some ore and chems from the loot box near the exit but its not worth running for 😅
---
There's going to come a week when it's not released yet again and you don't post this and I'm going to get really worried...
---
a "No Mic" emote is coming
---
Workshops are PVP areas. They wanted to PVP.
---
The most evenly-cooked meat in the history of mankind.
---
do anything but the main quests
---
on my 2nd character (now my main) i was 120 when i started the quests for rose.
---
Not that anything I say will change your mind but my Fixer did drop Murmrgh in November last year. Its probably the only solid drop I've ever had. Calm yourself man
---
But everywhere I read it says two shot was nerfed to only +25% extra damage?
---
Yawn!!
---
How the hell do the mole miners still exist? We are geociding them for some swag.
---
We didn't take any damage during the fight so that's kind of irrelevant tbh mate
---
Same thing here. I also was like level 110 before I started with mutations lol.
---
5-6 weeks, max?? You say this like it's a good thing lmfao.
---
Well thank the mothman I completed nthe run yesterday. Now I get to spend the 1500 atoms I earned.
---
I have 300+ improve d repair kits so I don't think that's a good idea especially if your an end game player
---
They are bugged weapons that do more damage than they should when certain conditions are met.
---
I went this build route also to hard counter bloodied, but I can barely even tickle them. I get the need to have lower burst because that would be pretty anti fun, but there are already several hard counters to the rifleman play style. Just wish I could be applicable at all for pvp but it just isn’t
---
I think it does. I don't group that often and only lately b/c of Score requirements. I don't think BGS has the foresight to put a distance limitation like that on a group considering all the glitches (Eh, features) the game has.
---
Thank you for your thoughtful response! I think you're right about the level 1-10 crowd. I'm going to shift things up a bit :)
---
They were new and wanted to PvP. Sounds fun, I remember that.
---
Yeah they're all:
---
- 50% more damage when your target is below 40% health
---
- 90% reduced weight
---
- Bashing damage increased by 40%
---
I would love it if the gigantic letters would show up.
---
I've got a few decent 10mm sub machine guns and I love using them. Suppressor is all I've been hoping for. They are fun guns with a nice sound.
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
Whole reason I've got a chemists backpack instead of grocers xd
---
I didn't say you are controlling anyone. I quite clearly said you want to control others. As in you want to control who joins the event in question.
---
If we weren't it would have been a shame. With the equipment level system of the game those weapons would be totally useless if the quest were done too early
---
You mean people that abused the XP glitch?  That’s a separate issue entirely. 
---
And there could even be a limitation on how much SCORE could carry over. Perhaps no more than 5,000 or so.  That’s less than 2% of the amount of SCORE needed to complete a season. 
---
Do *you* have a suggestion for any incentive after a player completes the Run, or during the down time between the end of one season and the next?  I’d love to hear your counter proposal.
---
Bloodied
---
33% hit chance 
---
1 agility
---
That was my other theory. That somehow you take some kind of minor damage from who knows what. I know I get that just running along the map sometimes. Where the character just goes “oof”. And there’s nothing around.
---
And the motel in Flatwoods
---
This is gonna be soooo nice.
---
Fair opinion. Not one I share, but reasonable.
---
we've all been there.  
---
just grind low level area for events and dailies, use different kind of weapons so you do not depend on one  type of ammo
---
I love the Grelok Bundle..... I will be purchasing that for my C.A.M.P. Im going with a dark mothman cultist theme and that throne would be perfect!
---
Damn, i wish i grinded more back in the day 🤧 do you think the deathclaw mask is a worthy trade for a good legacy?
---
depends on your platform.  IIRC, the smallest one I've seen (on PS4) has been about 1.5gb, the largest, closer to 50gb.  Fortunately, have not been too many of the huge ones.
---
On average, I think they run about 8gb.
---
If you actually read my comment I wasn't talking to him you chode, so thanks for further proving my point 👍🏻
---
The only weapons I currently have is a Level 5 Laser Pistol, and a Level 25 Double Barrel from events, but they dont do enough damage, and the Double Barrel is just too slow when reloading to kill enough quickly.
---
I know you didn't ask for potential fixes but I also had this issue (assuming it's the blood sample t-fuse thing). I ended up server hopping 3 or 4 times and eventually got it to work for me.
---
Happened to me last night.  It should just spawn you where it normally dies when you die.  Then again, I thought to myself “git gud.”  I’m a fan of death having harsh consequences.  People tend to play smarter.  It’s a collapsing mine full of dangerous shit.  Be more careful next time.  Thankfully he usually just drops scrip fodder and the real loot is from completing the event.
---
Not for all weapons.  All the projectile/energy based weapons ie. ballistic or energy damage were nerfed.  Weapons like the grenade launchers, missile launchers and fat man do explosive damage, and these still do double damage, not the 25% extra damage.
---
The 2nd shot is still likely limited to 100% of base weapon damage though, not really sure something like a 10% while aiming will count on the 2nd shot damage.
---
agreed.   Communication is key in any community.    I would love to sit at my camp, send a message out that I'm having a big sell-off cause ...well, I have too much crap!!!   ...and I'm lonely 😢.
---
More importantly, how are they not fixed yet?
---
You say I’m controlling, I say you thinking you’re entitled to go to a high level event with limited slots and do basically nothing while we get the rewards for you, well, entitled. It’s Bethesda’s fault for not putting a level requirement, doesn’t mean it still isn’t inconsiderate lol.
---
This is the result of never being told “no” in your life, right here. Everything is for you and anybody who tells you otherwise is a big meanie huh
---
Got the pack as well. Wanted the 3D ones to look like the guy from Zombies ate my neighbors.
---
You're going to make me go back to fo4
---
I am not saying that it is too easy but that it is unacceptable that as soon as you get in front of the boss you have to be quick and precise in hitting him because otherwise you will not get anything since he is killed immediately
---
They really aren't worth much.
---
I'm so confused. No clue why those who are most toxic always seem to accuse others of being the toxic ones haha
---
Whats this scavenger trader?
---
Hmm, I'm not too sure then. Are you using skeet shooter as a perk card?
---
Best solution, don’t be on during reset. Your poor time management is not an excuse.
---
Nice idea.
---
I hope it is, this bug is pretty bad.
---
It's an uneven trade but I reiterate all of the time. Let people trade what they want so long as they're educated on the situation. 5% drop rate on an event that is going to be forever.
---
However will the event become notably harder after the next update making the event pop off less? Could they fix the shortcuts in our nuke runs as well making it less appealing? Maybe wise to get the mask now while one cans. 
---
Either way an educated trade regardless of the imbalance is never a bad one.
---
I do the same, but still cant get rid of them fast enough. Some plans just never get bought because most everyone has them except for maybe someone that just started the game.
---
I have a nuke ready right now if you’re on? GT is GhostxElite893 send me a message and I’ll inv you to my private world
---
If me sarcastically thanking the OTHER people, who I made clear I was speaking to originally, and then explaining that to you is toxic in your eyes, then I don't want to know what an actual toxic person is to you
---
Because the game tells them to that's why. Just like Gta V Online, the game tells you to be an asshole to others trying to make money. Even though you only get 2k $. In 76, they lose all those supplies for what.
---
 Not a damn thing. Fyi, ESO economy is 1,000 time worse. Players come up with prices far beyond what the game vendors say those times are worth.  Honestly  I believe if Bethesda were to remove the cap on Caps the economy in 76 would 1 million time worse than it is now. The cap is the only thing keeping the economy in check.
---
Congrats 👏
---
I’m only like 40 ranks behind you
---
did you just ignore everything i just said. 
---
That's endgame armour and weapon in 5-6 weeks. guaranteed. No messing around. do a few easy events. buy some bullion from smiley. Done. no hassle. 
---
or you could have rng on top of rng doing a very hard raid once a week. 
---
if the raid even finishes of course because i was part of so many that either fell apart before the first boss after an hour of waiting around or after a few difficult boss fights people start leaving and you've wasted 3-4 hours. 
---
This way is absolutely fair on everyone.
---
What do you expect, its magic...
---
More the calling me a chode is toxic....
---
Every time Bethesda adds something new. 1 step forwards, 3 steps back
---
i always played solo and this happened on different servers seen and i have to pray that my gatling does enough damage to allow me to take exp and loot.
---
Ah and no, i don't have any weapons like 10mm that made 140 damage at shot
---
tbh the event is already a massive pain in the ass unless youre using legacies, magic weapons and maxed bloodied builds. so the update is probably gonna kill all motivation for anyone to do the event. its nerfing all damage output, removing all forms of magic damage, and bloodied while it will still be strongest, will be significantly reduced.
---
Totally agree.   And I'm a low level player.    One who wandered into the mine by mistake and proceeded to have his ass kicked while also bringing the entire team down.    Got nothing,  a few thumbs up for my bravery but really, not that much fun.    I'll wait till i'm a higher level thank you very much.
---
I Hope that It Will Nerf all these people
---
I meant stash sorry
---
Still not as bad as a pissed off Assaultron...
---
It needs legendary effects. Just look up the video.
---
My quests totally bugged out today, all my weekly and dailies auto completed, I'll likely never be able to complete them
---
I ignored everything you said about a different game that also has shit endgame grinding, yes.
---
I could also just get my loot right now, not getting on, turning in treasury notes, getting off everyday. This is a shit system no matter how you spin it or what games you compare it to bro
---
I've actually seen more people praising the MOM questline in the last few weeks than I've ever heard about it before. It's honestly such a great questline and I wish they'd do more with it. Some people theorize they might come back since there's around 6 members unaccounted for, and with the Raiders back I'd love to see if we can put a bullet in Brody's head.
---
If you're 15 bucks off of rent you've got larger problems
---
What is your build? 
---
The only generic tip I can think of is to stay where you drop into the area so Earle can't stomp on you and you flee into a safe wall most of the time. Move out just before he dies to avoid falling rocks.
---
I'm a full health build with Excavator PA and Medic Torso, which is generally enough to keep me alive, supplemented by manual stim use occasionally. I tend to ignore the Wendigos and for some reason, they don't attack that often either. I use various heavy guns, Primed F10 50 Cal, AAFFR Minigun, VFFR 50 Cal, which can do 4-20 damage/hit ideally.
---
too bad because every time there are always 200-300 levels players that destroy bosses in a short time
---
Nope, should I be?
---
No, I don't think so. the hype is gone...
---
Talk me out of buying the Quack. My willpower is waning.
---
Does his health scale with each person like the SBQ?
---
Agreed. For me I forever have the spawn glitch after death. I can not die at all or it's game over for me. I've done the Colossus event about 20 times grinding hard on PC since it came out. I have not gotten the mask at all. My friend had gotten it once and I bought one for a decent price. The barriers for this "end game" event will surely be worse soon. Although it's a decent drop rate at 5% it may continue to be hard to come by and asking price may remain high. Time will tell.
---
I consider that a non-response. Everything not implemented into this game is on a 'would be nice to do one day' list. That's utterly meaningless and says nothing to the players. 
---
There have been repeated, frequently supported requests for this basic feature. And they continue to ignore those requests. :/
---
Yes. Should be a magical minigun.
---
You are correct.  The bash damage is a magic effect.  
---
For the magic to work you need to maintain shots on the same body part over a period of time.  If you just spray bullets all over the place it won’t work.  Standing directly in front of the Queen and landing all shots on her face is a win.
---
Let me put it this way level 25 was probably around the time i got stuck i had to switch up my objectives then did a good maybe 15 -20 levels went alright and then take a guess what happend again....you guessed it hit another roadblock, i am now level 135 and this time im once again underpowered i dont know qhat happend but lost my 3 star fixer and a couple other things and my bloodied gauss is nerfed so now im way underpowerd again .  So all i can do is grind away and hope for the best enjoy what you can do my man
---
That's what I use on my magic Gauss and it seems to work. Won't hurt to try.
---
Yeah thats what i wanted to do but it kicked me out of the mine when he died because i was dead.
---
Then you should definitely be exploring for better gear.
---
You must have known what you needed to do to get it before you started your game I presume. I only got onto the mission-chain that leads toward the Enclave when I accidentally stumbled upon Blackwell's bunker after level 50.
---
I did not realize legendaries in 76 only got a health regen from mutating. In FO4 they did get other effects as well like extra defense and whatnot.
---
What I used; Furious Lever / 50% limb / 25% LVC on Earle, Instigating lever for the ads.
---
Hitting normal shots for 100-125, crits for 400-500 on the heads of Earle.
---
I was sitting @ 40-50% health so bloodied dps was lower than normal, but many less deaths.
---
Much better than the AA/FFR gatling gun I used on my support that tickeled for damage in the teens.
---
What if we use "threshold" and "floor" to describe parts of a house, and use "minimum level requirement" for this event instead?
---
Or they're in massive debt and are buying things to try and self medicate as it were.
---
Swing your camera around some, it should change the build area even if your camp module can only go on the edge of water.
---
This. Unless you are running an ammo business or supplying multiple people, this is plenty with all the right perks.
---
Damn I would def, but I’m at work for another hour then I’ll be home
---
It took me a minute but I eventually got that reference
---
And they're RED flower curtains.
---
Damn Commies.
---
Neh.. no more free Atoms Bethesda. I like stunting on poor people with all my Atom Shop purchases. Oh yes.. that new Atom Shop bundle.. thats right I bought it.
---
Personally I find it easier to hit the body and it still does a lot of damage.
---
Wait, if you use it to get your bearing on what day of the week it is....HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN TO POST!!!!!
---
GTA was the last online game I properly played and I think it’s what had made me a bit hesitant. Everyone I’ve met in 76 has been super lovely and I feel like I don’t want to ruin this nice, in game community I think we have by upsetting some higher levels because I’ve wandered in to an event that is too hard. 
---
Everyone’s replies here have made me a bit more courageous though.  I think I’ll steer clear of that huge big one everyone is talking about now and just try some of the others out.
---
I have 900 and am not done with wastelanders haha but I do still need a mental break to get engaged again
---
Give me that sweet sweet Med-X....
---
What the fuck did you say
---
u/Jimusmc I have a few hundred rounds you can have on PC same IGN as Reddit
---
I'm just a dude...
---
it's the human version of the vendor bot responder. Can possibly have some rare apparel that you can only buy from the rare traders that randomly spawns. Longshoreman outfit and hunters long coat are two of them. Both can sell for 5k+ and only cost a couple of hundred.
---
i find the one at lost home a lot. 3 times tonight so far and only checked lost home maybe 12 times.
---
I'm going to suggest this in the PTS forum if it hasn't been already, because with the patch 22 nerfs it's really really needed, not just to recover materials, but for the next run of the event too. I had to repair my fixer three times during one event, thankfully there's a workbench in the respawn area, but with the time I wasted repairing we probably could have finished before the timer expired.
---
Should go well with our....
---
LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE!
---
if one wendigo starts to like another one....
---
If you are close to a full stash, and you have weapon WR perks, and the actual weight of the weapon would put you over stash limit, it will not transfer the weapon.  you may (or may not) get a brief message in the upper left about weight.
---
For example, at 785# in stash, I cannot xfer my tenderizer.  I have WR armor and the bear arms perk (they stack), so the tenderizer only weighs 8# on my char, but almost 20 in the stash.  since 785 + 20 is 805, and the stash limit is 800, it denies the transfer.
---
It's an instinct at this point. I wake up and go "oh boy it's atom shop update day" and thus I know it's Tuesday.
---
I met a few blood eagles who gave my new character a bit of trouble early on!
---
lmao yeah that sounds about right.
---
Ah. So kinda like a furious effect? And is it to the same body part like if going against the W. Colossus it has to be a specific body part like all shots to his leg (I know it’s not realistic) or just hit him consecutively?
---
And I shouldn’t take of the accelerated barrel then since I think it’ll make the fire rate below 200.
---
&gt;Then I put on my high capacity backpack which put my DR in the negative but didn't show a number at all
---
As far as I know, it disables the Berserker benefits completely when you do this. It has to be exactly 0 DR or it gets disabled, thats why the majority of people recommend the unpure way (using low level armor to get to 0DR).
---
&gt;This is a great sneak build but the damage needs a buff.
---
Agreed, the risk/reward factor is way off compared to other builds.
---
I mean if you used an explosive gat plas that loss is kinda your own fault, especially considering his explosive damage resistance is busted high, I'd recommend any non explosive heavy over it tbh
---
Ever seen a clown car?
---
Don’t go there.
---
You're like 6 days late, chief.
---
"It's a hard life pickin' rocks and pullin' teats, but it sure beats havin' ta fight dudes with treasure trails."
---
My suggestion would be as it seems to be related to NW, is to finish the dailies/weeklies first then play NW if you are wanting them. Anytime I play NW the auto complete happens so I finish the dailies/weeklies first then play NW and haven't had any issues when doing it that way.
---
Did they have anything better to do than wild, wild Wendigo sex?
---
Actually, I believe there is a data mined deathclaw hunter outfit coming. It’s coming from the new and improved treasure moles.
---
They made babies 🤭
---
Damn this is a good idea.   I’m so tired of the slow burn that dailies give.   Been working on raider rep for like two weeks, only halfway through ‘neighborly’
---
Tbh I'm still trying to unlock the backpacks lmao
---
Hmmmm, I can’t say as I’m not at my console, what I usually do is just press X to take (in the inventory and stash menu), take all I can stomach, and then drop from my pip boy inventory afterwards. Does that help?
---
It's not in game. Not sure if it's a bug or not
---
Wasn't on NW at all
---
Ah thanks
---
Would be nice to have this as an option once you’ve completed the rep grind with one char. There is absolutely ZERO incentive to play my alts now because of the.... *grind*
---
How long has this been in the game? Since the start if i remember right? Lol
---
How’s a 5.56 pistol mod a that gun reference? Wouldn’t it just be a reference to... 5.56 pistols?
---
Nope, at level 15 I looked up how to launch a nuke since the game had shown a lot of nukes in trailers and I was wondering if they were even In the game lol, I did however show my newer friends how to find the enclave, so I think it’s just safer to have a cap at 50
---
What would a baby wendigo even look like?
---
Hunting rifle is a good gun at your level. See if someone will craft you a BoS Recon Rifle at your level.  With stealth these are lethal.  Also, craft up a board and attach the spiked mod.  Or a baseball bat with the All Star mod.  Great weapons.  Mod a pipe revolver into a rifle (stock option), these make wonderful guns, too.
---
Why would anyone even use them if you can just walk around with one in your hands?
---
A full squad of 3 drummers and 3 meat spinners (lol) working for the full 2 minute prep time starts the event off past the second icon. This is my second Meat Week, and each Meat Cook has been well attended and quickly completed.
---
I wouldn’t worry about binning the lot unless there is anything you’re attached to. Quest items will be locked anyway. (I personally kept the collectible ones I.e tales from the unexpected types, so I could see what I had yet to collect)
---
But weren’t they eating each other?
---
What's your platform?
---
Since at least the start of score. I don’t know about the other challenges having that issue.
---
Well godamn open your eyes!!!
---
Again, at no point did I say you are controlling. I said you WANT to control strangers.
---
I also don't fully understand why you believe I am one of the players you clearly dislike. At no point have I referenced to or suggested I partake in the activity your complaint is centred around.
---
I have suggested attempting to control the way anonymous strangers behave in a videogame could be called entitled. Hence my initial comment of surprise.
---
The chemist backpack mod can be bought from the Raiders with bullion at a pretty low rep
---
Workshops are the last remaining PvP zones in the game.
---
I really think extended breaks away from a game like this is therapeutic, i took a 3 month break due to burnout and decided to come back and it felt like everything was new to me again, loved it.
---
"I was playing while the reset happened"
---
People, you gotta stop doing this.
---
Didn't seem to make a difference. Its weird, with my combat shotgun 1 can one shot a supermutant. With the gauss it takes two or 3 shots unless im really up close.
---
I was just giving an example, but yes, any body part will work.
---
Thanks. I was trying to figure out a way to avoid having each note display on my screen again. The classic you click the note, it makes you read it on the screen, then move it. I was trying to figure out if there was a way to bypass that animation. I have to put the time into. It’s all me.
---
I accidentally stumbled into Colossal Problem the other day. I can't remember how, perhaps I fast travelled to a team mate who moved into Monongah mine before I arrived, in any case, I ended up in the mine.
---
I probably did very little damage to Earle, I can't remember if I could loot the body, think I got killed by something just after he died and then spawned outside the mine.
---
But yeah, the other seven people (or less) managed to kill him without my help. If I was fast travelling to a team mate then presumably that person also only entered the mine about a minute before Earle was killed which would mean only six really participating.
---
Someone was bitching on here early this week about how ya high levels should “respect the low levels decision to join the event”
---
If you’re on PS4, I can give you the plan
---
If you think having some leveling restrictions and thinking people are inconsiderate is controlling then idk what to tell you homie
---
I don't know if it's a 20 hour timer like bullion or not but if it isn't, it comes back the same time you bought it the previous day.
---
I haven't gotten the ability to craft backpacks yet, I'm still working on the world challenges.
---
20 hours after your first trade in, like all other vendors
---
Season Pass reward.
---
Meat week cookout on the hour did me dirty
---
PA needs a mod like whatever those feral ghouls have to make them haul ass away whenever I jump up on a car or something where they can't swat at me 😂
---
For sure
---
20h it is
---
Especially considering the coming damage nerf’s might be slightly manageable with this perk
---
Oo that fire is bad
---
I know the delicious meat is tempting.
---
Or 20k in ammo
---
It can go on the small backpack.   I was able to craft that almost right out of the vault.   If you can’t and you’re on PS4, pretty sure I can give you the backpack
---
Again, at no point did i allude to that conclusion. As none of those points are in the game.
---
I'd never have enough chems to convert. Always the first thing I sell at train station vendors. Keep about 20 Rad-X and Radaway, sell the rest
---
The damage ramps up over time.  On a super mutant, he’ll be dead long before the magic affect happens.   Over 5-10 seconds of firing you’ll see the health bar dropping normal, then faster, then melting.  
---
The accelerated barrel isn’t required but certainly adds to the affect.   The prime barrel has the same fire rate as stock but also does magic damage.
---
I'm close to the end, yesterday was one of the first in a while where I didn't actually gain a level.  96/100, so very close.  Might spent some Atoms to finish it off so I can take a breather before season 2...
---
You want to PVP got to Nuclear Winter,  there should be no PVP in adventure mode. It hard enough just trying to survive the game, we dont need other people killing us as well. And workshops dont give alot of supplies either,  only 1 or 2 evey 8 to 10 minutes. And the have to defend it from NPCs,  just a fucking headache.  I never do workshops,  and always seem to have just enough scrap, or food and chems. Workshops are not a key part to surviving the waste  land. They do nothing to help you fight off the enemies in the game. With all these new camp based items workshops are well pointless. Like I said PVP is Nuclear Winter,  keep it there dont be a dick just for a few peices of scrap. PSA, if you have fallout  1st do your workshops there. You will be 100% safe from the scum.
---
I have no idea then.
---
Grab a set of power armor and a 2 handed weapon, even non legendary a sledgehammer/super sledge will do a lot of damage with power attacks to one shot most stuff. I usually do that until 30 and then grab a gatling gun to do beckett's questline for the final word and level to 50. Then it's a case of farming or buying good equipment.
---
Shit, I've beej trying to no death this game.
---
Current record is level 84 without dying.
---
Ah, I'm a bit anal about spoilers so I didn't look stuff like that up.
---
My weapon broke so I had to run the the bench. By the time I switched perks, repaired, and switched again he was killed. There wasn’t enough time to go back and loot him. Bummer
---
Doesn't make sense one would work and the other one not. Are you a Bloodied build?
---
Not in PS4 but I can gurantee you vendors will be flooded in stuff from this event in a couple of weeks
---
Or instead of going one extreme to another, find a balance for casual and try hard sweat masters.  
---
Ya'know kinda what makes a online community you complete and utterly meta obsessed religious twat knobble.
---
Radiation is damage. You went in damaged.
---
My 10 fps too XDDD. I don't use Tesla since the pixelateds clouds of shit. I can't fucking move.
---
&gt;People, you gotta stop doing this.
---
Playing broken games? I agree.
---
I am buying so many plushies when I get home 😋😋 I love your idea of a painting to commemorate slaughtering 1000 type-x enemies. It would be cool if Bethesda had a community contest for the artwork to be used in game for this. I'm sure there are too many reasons why that wouldn't work or ever happen, but it's A Nice Idea.
---
Nope its just what the purveyor gave me.
---
My combat shotgun is a quad , 50 dmg resistance , 33% hitnchance
---
Yep, I'm also doing a non-mutated, no-buffs playthrough on my character. I wouldn't say it's caused me to use any incredibly clever strategies though, unless "shoot things with a silenced weapon while crouched" counts. But joking aside, I don't find my damage is too low - with an automatic weapon I can gun down most enemies fairly fast when I do get detected, just not as fast as the optimised builds can.
---
They don’t need to add this if there will be a fix for it soon anyway. Remember that thing they mentioned where enemies do client sided scaling/descaling depending on the player’s level instead of the level of the area?
---
It's geared to appeal to twitch shooting meta following sweat master try hards. 
---
Casual people just wanting to unwind and play Fallout are being shoved out because the Doritos and MT Dew crowd demand their 1% possible content.
---
Be honest with yourself here.  I see folks whinging about not getting queen loot after a 15 minute battle.  15 minutes!  It's *end* game content. Not beginning game content, or mid-game content.  This is something to battle when you're optimized.   I was shocked when I started reading threads saying that they failed this event, or spent thousands of rounds of ammo or what-not.  I mean, are you starting this event with a pack of level 40 players?  And if you did.  WHY did you?  (not targeting you directly here FraTheGamer, it's just where I hit reply).  I agree with [u/Dannyravenhall](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dannyravenhall/) , this boss actually needs a bit of a buff. We'll see what happens after one wasteland, but for now, it's an easy 5 min event where we get to farm loads of ammo and screws and fiberglass and legendary items.
---
Ah ok. So all you need to activate it is a specific legendary effect the faster fire rate just gets to max damage faster?
---
no u
---
That might be why then.
---
And the gym at VTU.
---
Because word have many meaning and can be use many way
---
You have to be below 60% to pass TS damage in my experience.
---
Ah on Google it says I can get a small backpack plan from Morgantown overseers cache
---
You should file a support ticket with Bethesda, not here.
---
Holeeee sheeeit
---
I'll grab just about anything decor related but these "new" curtains were a quick and easy pass for me.
---
Embarrassing effort.
---
Flower ones are a welcome addition.
---
This
---
BoS: Operation hOpe4FUTURE is an entire chapter of BoS roleplayers who play this way. We don't even use legendary gear in our roleplay for this reason. It totally changes the game.
---
Earl is a major bullet sponge.   And the other wendigos don’t help.  So I only do the event if I feel like using up all my ammo.
---
Trying to do it with less than 8 or low level players makes it too much trouble.  I found that I finally have a use for my stockpile of stimpaks.
---
I’ve done it without dying in power armor.   A vampire weapon is the way to go.
---
More ammo types outside of Ultracite sounds cool im down for that.
---
Would it still use flux or would it be more of a mid-game inbetween regular and ultracite?
---
Asexual budding.
---
No, did you forget about the Nuclear Winter PVP server.
---
Should be 20 hours, but if you have a scheduled gametime 24 is easier to remember.
---
I'm posting it cuz clearly nobody else is talking about it even though I figured it out day one there's still a ton of people who are just standing around for 2 minutes before it starts.
---
wow.
---
Every.Single.Week
---
You could have turned it into scrip. I always rename and favorite my gear so that it is less likely to be lost while I spam space bar to sell/scrap/scrip gear.
---
I *really* want the Cage and Spike armours to be available for players. We see the occasional Raider wearing it, but it's not possible to get it for yourself. They're probably the coolest outfits in the game as far as the apocalyptic feel goes.
---
Wow, in that case I would at least open a ticket with Bethesda. I didn't know it was doing it without even playing NW
---
Or just share the rep and plans, as almost daily suggested on this sub
---
No one is sure exactly what fire rate is needed. Some say 200, others say 175.  We do know it only works on the high fire rate weapons.   I only know of 6 legendary traits that provide the affect.  Three are primary affects and two are secondary.  You only need one of the six.
---
If you try placing the near the top of the wall, it should display normally. It worked for me at least. Hope they fix it soon
---
They will always release the good stuff of an update in the atomic shop, because that's how they do business.
---
Everybody applied this system after fortnite did it, because it sold very good.
---
Bethesda also prices them so high,for example you often have to pay at least ten bucks for one PA skin. 
---
One. The high prices weren't so bad, if they added a reliable way to earn atoms. You get basically 5% of what those things should pay out. I mean 20 atoms for playing the game 7600 hours? EXCUSE ME? You can't buy anything for 20 atoms. It should pay at least 7600 atoms for all the time you waste playing this over monetized, buggy, bad balanced game. 
---
"Truth is, the game was rigged from the start" - Benny
---
Got it from my first and only run.  Had no idea people wanted the thing that bad.  Looks neat but it went directly into my stash.
---
That would be so sick
---
If it were the scorched wouldn’t be a problem in wastelanders lol. If they lost their queen their hive mind would’ve collapsed
---
Yeah!
---
Bulk as much as you can to make room in your stash, also there is a perk that reduces the weight of your armor.
---
Considering how much weapon durability you can potentially go through for this fight, yeah it only makes sense.
---
More food = more room for baby wendigos?
---
since at least NW started and so many challenges themselves have been bugged since launch that you can't complete them despite doing the challenge. They seem to have stopped using those ones though.
---
Updated my info.  I only post this stuff so people know why their builds are “so good” or “can kill anything”.
---
Based on the website, the Vault Boy plushie will be available the 26th-27th for 140 atoms. (Scroll to the bottom for the plushie list by day.)
---
I guess...
---
I love it, want me a grafton pushing, just a little blob of floof
---
Also, more fluxes? We get what seems to be two of them.
---
Can you not boost it to be same level as what we get from Queen?
---
There needs to be more long term reasons to play this event.
---
Bloodied is absolutely a part of it, or more accurately, the ability to park rads where you feel comfortable enough to maximize damage.   
---
Bloodied still does too much damage though, even without taking how rads work into consideration.
---
lot got 'em
---
Congrats mate! I finished today too. I was expecting some party at the eng though
---
If that's the case it's on like donkey Kong. I grinded hard last event... This time around I'll literally melt my PC
---
Very hard to find a spot to build in the water. Best bet is to find an object floating in the water and place your camp on it. For example there is a row boat and nuka cola bottle in the river by the nuka plant. This will give you more space in the water but you have to build around said object.
---
I hope this doesn’t come off poorly, but where are you all finding the hoss-ass collossi?
---
I have a two-shot ultracite gatling laser with +50% limb damage and Ultracite PA, and I’m specced for heavy guns.
---
I can kill this abomination solo with about 5 fusion cores, without proccing magic damage.  I’m level 235, but I’ve had the same build for the last hundred levels.  Not bloodied or junkies.
---
Edit:  yes, I’m talking about Earle
---
Only a few things actually weigh less when bulked.   I know lead is one of them, I forget the rest
---
you do not need 4 ranged weapons
---
I was using my bloodied ultracite plamsa caster and didn't get ultracite plasma cartridges back. Just standard ones. Which are useless to me.
---
I just don't understand why there was almost no one was complaining about this until it was live on consoles. Are PC players just generally higher level? I've done the even dozens of times on PC and the lowest I've ever seen was a level 53 or so.
---
There’s supposed to be one for Arktos Pharma. It’s never worked.
---
Yeah I've tried this a couple dozen times by now. Usually anytime a server seems "fresh"
---
You level 500 bloodied commandos need to start thinking about more than just getting more out of an event than you out in
---
Aid items, even with the chemist backpack mod, and several other weight negating effects, is always what’s keeping me overweight.   Also, gunpowder and ore are deceptively heavy, don’t forget to check the misc tab.    And make sure you’re not carrying too much ammo, missiles, etc
---
Ah ok. Great thanks for all the info!!
---
In your stash, take out all your junk and make sure that it has been scrapped down to components before putting it back in. You should also bulk up some of your junk and sell it, aside from steel, ballistic fibre, screws, lead, adhesive and springs you dint need more than 100 of any material. 
---
Check for ammo you don’t use. 40mm grenades, mini nukes, missiles, plasma cores and fusion cores will weigh you down quickly, and huge quantities of other ammo. 
---
You’re probably carrying too much aid too. Check to see if you are carrying spoiled food, bottles of alcohol and chems. You can get by fine with just 20 stim packs and 20 water.
---
Well, we’ll see. This could upend the meta as far as builds go and make all the fights that much more tougher
---
And the hornwright gym
---
Glad we can change the alien gun handgrip back, but could you please make it better. That gun is cheese
---
You're high enough now to use T45 power armor. I highly, highly recommend that and a gatling gun. I haven't looked back since I started using those.
---
Keep looking, I just found 3k at a vendor yesterday.
---
This thread has inspired me to go draw some wendigos for r34
---
I mean... I’m excited to see how hard the game will get. I really hope this does a lot and makes boss fights that much more difficult. Tbf tho I am a lvl 30 so I’m not one of y’alls op bloodied junkie stealth commando builds but still
---
And thank goodness for that. Nice to see another emote that's not bundle locked.
---
Counterpoint, I don’t want to play Checklist 76, a cheesy mobile game wannabe bribing me to log in each day. I want to play Fallout 76 because it’s an apocalyptic wasteland worth engaging in. Keep the atoms, give me content.
---
First, please don’t, second, I gotta ask about the name.
---
Seriously, there are much better ways to gather resources.  What you get from the workshop extractors isn’t all that much.  Besides, you can’t put the raw ore directly into your infinite stash anyway.   
---
Workshops are for PvP.  That’s just the way it is.  You agreed to it before paying the caps.  PvP isn’t a sin.  Sounds like you both had fun anyway, lol.
---
You can easily get 2000c for it altough is a pretty mediocre gun
---
MY GUTS HURT - Mero
---
100% this  
---
The timeline moved forward a year and yet the scorched remain. I'm of the opinion that the only way to truly kill the scorched is to follow up on Scribe Takano's plan to utilize the equipment at VTU to find a flaw that can be exploited in their DNA personally.
---
What should I file it as all the support catagories/sub catagories did fit the issue
---
That entire article shows how many of them don't understand shit about games
---
Get good too
---
Jetpack is a good alternative
---
You mean that guy from the bible?
---
Haha yes!!!   That’s exactly what I do.  But sometimes I find myself in some situations that require an environmental tactic .. like a parking lot full of cars and leading my enemies into that trap or planting mines and making them chase me.. that’s always fun.   Even using vats to cripple an enemy first before finishing them off is a good strategy that works for me.  Rifleman build helps a ton there.
---
You can download the X-01 schematics from the whitespring bunker for free, if you don't feel like hunting for T60 piecemeal.
---
Guess I can sell my croc backpack plan now\~!
---
Yeah getting this error as well. Knowing this dev team. It won’t be fixed for a long time.
---
Because even right now after almost a whole season we don’t know what causes it or how to reproduce it. You look at everyone’s post and it’s just “I logged in today and WTF!”
---
Lifebar goes brrrr
---
In what way? The very existence of this thread is kind of validation for their standpoint IMO.
---
I think from what I read Colossal Problem is triggered by a nuke on a specific place, but I haven’t run it so I may be mistaken.
---
It's the contrary, you need to participate in the colossal problem to be able to complete “Something Sentimental”.
---
Edit: as u/ShayMonMe pointed you (or anybody) need to nuke the monongah mine to trigger the colossal problem event.
---
I was honestly surprised to find out it doesn't drop any improved repair kits, I need me those orange boxes.
---
Talk about generic.
---
Oh yes I know. But not even a single nuke has been dropped in the area either.
---
I'm honestly not sure, but I would sure as hell be spamming them with tickets till it gets fixed if that is the case and you have proof of purchase.
---
Oh yeah they tore me a new one this morning lol
---
You're a good one
---
Then maybe get a group together and drop one?
---
everytime our character dies down there, they turn into a wendigo.
---
Great Idea! And a bigger camp budget!
---
I am not sure you fully understand the motivations of the people who do nuke people's camps
---
From previous update (look under Items):
---

---
* **Unarmed Weapons:** Fixed an issue causing Unarmed Weapons to deal less damage than intended.

---
* **Gauley Mine:** Enemies and loot inside Gauley Mine now scale up more appropriately with player levels.
---
Congrats!!!  I finished last week.  Now my log in time is kinda empty in a way.  I’ve been checking daily challenges for over a year.  It’s nice to have the score stress behind me...no longer care that I’m maxing intelligence at every event.  But still....
---
It’s definitely odd narratively. There’s that many cannibals?
---
Lets be real though, if you arent able to beat this event on your own I dont even want you on my team either. You're just as much a waste of space as they are. I love excluding people for being garbo.
---
Yes I get that. But as I mention I haven’t seen a single event yet. So therefore I have not been able to participate to complete the quest lol.
---
I am using ultracite 308 and all getting in return
---
Not convinced that logging out at reset matters. Been grinding meat week and have been doing the one at reset since start. Not one issue with auto completed challenges.
---
Finished in style! Congrats on Legendary Done.
---
Nice pull.
---
aluminum is the other I think
---
Yes if only I had friends lol. 
---
I’ll maybe have to ask on here later when I’ve gathered enough ammo for the event. 
---
Thanks for the info tho. I was wondering if I couldn’t see the nuke being dropped if I didn’t do it myself at first.
---
I had read a really good idea a few weeks ago on here. The person suggested that once the BOS shows up maybe we can turn our known plans over to them and receive a new currency in order to purchase unknown plans from them. I liked the idea except for adding another currency... and actually having to do business with the brotherhood.
---
I’ve pretty much decided that I’m not gonna get Earle’s loot unless he dies by the exit tunnel - I’m only after the plans and helmet anyway
---
much like SBQ.. in time people will learn to not have their base anywhere near where that circle might go
---
Yep, and a few are round lv50. Motivation is there, delivery is not, so far at least. 
---
Getting mad screws for loot though
---
30% isn’t enough. The poor gun does like 13points of damage. Going to make its base at 17 points now...
---
oh my lordive seen this like 5 times but didnt know i had to put it in the custom ini im finna kms  
---
thank you
---
You ever get a burger that looks sooooo damn tasty?    Don’t make the same mistake I did.
---
If you have a mic you can ask people to help after the Meat Cook maybe.
---
Congrats wanderer! I finished yesterday and now I’m back to playing half aimlessly doing weird stuff. Feels good!
---
Can you join a regular random server?
---
Can't agree more. Lowlevels should stay out of this event
---
The final exit from the mine, or the exit from the boss room?
---
I stood in that exact spot last night for the second half of the fight, and he never moved or attacked any of my teammates after that. Perfect place to tank him from.
---
just nuke it yourself or find a group, I have been using this subreddit's discord server to find groups and already got all the exclusive rewards from that boss.
---
For those stuck in the mine with Earl
---
Thanks for the PSA I guess
---
They'll never do this. I said this on another thread, what they should do is give us one perk coin for every daily and 2 or 3 for every weekly completed after we complete the season. they should also make the seasons completable by the weeklies only with the dailies as an incentive to finish sooner so you can grind for perk coins.
---
I thought there was one other
---
It'll still do more damage than my furious weapons, so it's gonna be possible
---
unlucky you. Go nuke the mine.
---
Earle eats regular colossi for breakfast.
---
Finished today as well, just in time to have beat a collosal problem a couple of times and to have gotten all the rewards from meat week. Now I think it's time to take a little break and dip back in when daily ops drop.
---
Check your ammo and aid items. Those will be the biggest weight drainers. Stimpacks are heavy is any ammo you don't use. Cores,missiles,nukes all have to go or convert them well not the cores. Also plans 4 plans equal 1 pound so if you aren't learning or hoarding them they add up.
---
Love the video I tried solo IT with vampire explosive 50 cal and some buffs as you with criar vang build and I did IT in 1.40 min
---
Oh didn’t know there was a discord. Thanks for letting me know. That might be my solution.
---
I haven't even done it once and I have all the exclusive rewards. The glory of tr4ding.
---
If you do ask, make sure you include your platform. I haven't been on much, if on Xbox, check the LFG (Looking for Group).
---
I know that gifts were duped to shit but can they not put every other melee skin on a plan only found from the damned gifts?
---
I just made another one. Suppressors with 50% limb damage. No mods on it or anything and still it doesnt work as well as my combat, oh well.
---
Oh yeah sorry. I’m on PS4
---
I'm just saying if someone's camp is near the mine or SBQ event they're asking for it cause my intention is to get the edge of the icon so we can get out without rads im not really thinking about the camp to all the people with camps near the sbq or mine that I've blown up sorry I guess
---
Just found out there was a discord as well lol. I never knew. 
---
Thanks for the help bud.
---
I’m talking about Earle.  Regular collossi are about 1.5-2 cores
---
Is that just your suggested title for next week or is there some good stuff dropping?
---
Awesome! Good luck getting a group and beating that quest.
---
Talladega nights..."Abra-Cadabra Homes!!now you see me...now you dont"
---
thanks!
---
Did you scrap all of your junk?
---
Check to see if you have any useless crap like asbestos. 
---
Shouldn’t really have more than 50-100 of most scrap. 
---
If you have PA pieces in your stash, make sure they are on a chassis. 
---
What about ammo?
---
Take off all your weight reduction perks before exploring your stash so you can see the true weights of things and understand the culprit.
---
I really doubt that applies to instanced bosses
---
It's in a separate bundle that was in the atomic shop a couple of months ago.
---
Wendigo plushie plan in my second run
---
Yeah, that sucks.
---
I completed the Legendary run today too.
---
What am i supposed to do now? I was only able to collect total of 1430 atoms by getting the Atom rewards from the battle-pass and from the life time challenges.
---
I really hope this means I can use a stimpak without having to wait 3 seconds for my weapon barrel to stop spinning.
---
Thanks man! From what I hear I’ll need it!
---
Just get a wanted level :)  jk
---
Hella foodbuild comment um most ppl dont like NW with its 5min time to get playing.
---
But it might
---
There might be a higher percentage of casually oriented players on console?  I dunno.

I dedicate one vending machine for plans, all common plans are posted for one week at 50 caps each, every Sunday I pull them and replace them with plans that I have found over the week and dump last weeks at a train station. Even at 50 caps I sell quite a few plans(since the legendary run has us capturing workshops I’ve always got an abundance of plans to sell).
---
Is there a list showing how rare plans are? Or even just what the rare ones are?
---
Check your xbox live.had a issue kept restarting to load screen.live was expired
---
Makes Assassin slightly less terrible but it's still terrible.  Human*oid* would probably be better.
---
But even then probably not by much.
---
If you fast travel to a teammate in the cave it puts you back in
---
Just a shame the south side of the mine has a ton of dope locations to build at that you'd be hard pressed to find elsewhere.
---
Will the nuka cola helmet bubble work havent checked if it's just a bubble
---
My issue is it displays properly but its now a part of the wall and I can't move it without taking the wall with it
---
Mean stash sry
---
I put a tent by the event after missing 3 cookouts because of this nonsense and how fast the event goes.
---
I'm just hoping that they put out some good Halloween costumes this year. Preferably before the event. 
---
Not sure why they haven't tried adding the mercenary gear and stuff like that yet. Maybe they will add it with some new faction. Mobster stuff seems lacking despite that being a big part of fallout as well.
---
Right? He was fidgety but manageable
---
Man I wanna have that mod but lead lines helps me a lot
---
Yh it works
---
OMG they made Assassins better now it works against NPCs to bad that it is still horrible. 10% damage is pitiful any of yall remeber in like Fallout 4 when these bonuses were like 50% on the low end
---
I'm sure it exists, but I would think/hope that constitutes a small minority of them
---
It's a damn video game lol. Your killing a few pixels on a screen in a made up world. By this logic, you should be in Federal Prison for killing the President in Fallout 3
---
Herpaderp
---
This is the problem that often there are players who ruin the game at all because they do a lot of damage and for the other people Is impossible to do the minimum amount of damage to get the loot, I say that as a level 100 player with totally legit weapons.
---
Mine is hanging off the top cover of the grand piano.
---
lol you’re new around here, arent you
---
Stonks
---
Ok.still sucks none the less.i wouldn't use the Cosmo outfit with out the bubble..doesn't feel right to me
---
in the main game? no, on the PTS. yes they are sold with gold at foundation and crater
---
Sometimes I have to open/start another game, then reopen/start FO76 for my friends list to reappear.
---
Really?   And Here I thought this was a unique thing.   How many are in this chapter?
---
Choose 1-2 ranged weapons and that’s it. At your level you may want to do 1 and 1 for ranged and melee so you won’t tear through your ammo. 
---
In addition, remove mini nukes, missiles, spikes, arrows and from your inventory. Not worth keeping for most players.
---
Lastly invest into quality of life perks or armor to increase your carrying capacity. Look through your strength cards to see what you got. Excavator PA is a must. Google how to get it.
---
Yeah. Sounds hard!
---
I’m guessing he scales with other players.  The closest I came to soloing Earle was after launching a nuke and having a lvl 30 and 60 show up.  It took me about 6000 2mm out of a junkies gauss mini.  The other two players were constantly dying, one with a lever gun and the other with a baseball bat, so I can only guess I did at least 95% of the work.
---
For meat week just spawn at 76 and sprint over it saves time
---
Even more so, they dont wven take the time to flop hou off properly, they just autorespond
---
Someone already got bodyslide working
---
They have the strangest aversion to releasing BoS/Enclave themed atom stuff despite those two being among the more significant base game factions. 
---
But Responders and Free States? Swimming in atom cosmetics. I don't get it.
---
That’s good but I can already answer the “do u have a mic” question with a thumbs down. We need more. At least a group chat or chat only for friends idk.
---
And the gym inside Charleston Fire Station
---
This post wasnt about vaults
---
I played the event for the first time last night. I played with a group of friends in a private server and it was fun. And we swapped private servers a few times for the nuke silos.
---
I know not everyone has the ability to do that but I think it made the event more enjoyable. We were dropping Earle in 10 minutes every time.
---
I’m stuck here too! This is so annoying on Xbox though
---
Thx
---
I've heard all mobs are gonna be like that.
---
It’s kinda bs if you ask me
---
it is what it is yo.. shits a nuke zone now.. lol
---
They have admitted they messed up and are planning on "fixing" that. Just hope that means they'll include it with the legendary run and not just change the description.
---
I tried to kill Earnie yesterday with a group of three other high levels and he phased through the roof and the floor the whole event and we failed because of it.
---
They should have been the rewards for BOS dumps
---
Agreed, this mass amount of goofy isn't fallout. Sure, fallout had it's humor, but it was dark.
---
There must be some mad costume maker out there in the wilds knocking these abominations out. Perhaps it's the next boss battle?
---
That and Vintage Nukashine were two of my favorite surprises that I didn't expect.  And Biv still talks to me daily to remind me of the good times.  I need that from the MoM.
---
I think that's the point of one wasteland tbh. The great equalizer-ish
---
Why not? They keep your sandwiches fresh and your beans from getting freezer burned.
---
I prefer to keep a few boxes of them on hand, gallon and quart size at least.
---
My gat-laser does 5 damage on point blank head shots.  I dump a whole core on the main head of Earl.
---
No effect beyond decreasing his heath by the smallest of fractions.  It should stagger or cause some reaction, maybe run away.
---
Otherwise I feel like I am just holding the mouse button down.   
---
I’m in PA and backed into a nook so the other wendigos have limited access to me.   I can keep it up as long as I have stimpaks.  Being in a nook means the fear retreat doesn’t move me, just prevents me from fighting for a moment.  Then right back to face shots on Earl.  I’m lvl 170.
---
I’ve completed the event without dying, much thanks to the other player doing their best too.
---
I had to dump Beckett and the old guy because they wouldn't give me dailies for days on end. I would scrap them, and I'd get an instant alert box that said "Quest failed" like it had been active, but I could never get it or activate it. Doing pretty good with Radio Punk. Gonna stick with him awhile.
---
Just realized that every one in this chat has a dope ass name..
---
I’ve been reluctant to log in because I know my camp is toast. I am camped near the Bravo silo, enjoyed watching nuke launches from my porch. Had my fingers crossed that I’d be far enough away from ground zero that my camp could serve as a rest stop for other players, but looking more and more doubtful. Time to find my next “forever” home.
---
More than crashed. Two days in a row I’m dealing with invisible enemies, endless loading screens, superb lag, armor breaking out of nowhere, guns go missing. Then suddenly I am disconnected over and over again. I even had an encounter with almost a hundred eyebots spawning constanly at poseidon workshop. Today I got killed by a level 5 molerat cuz I couldn’t see it.
---
If your on PC I’ll craft you something. Only lvl 67 here so others will have more plans. If your interested provide your IGN
---
I have no way of knowing if it matters. When I got hit by the bug, I logged off 4 hours before the reset, and logged on 6 hours after, so obviously it didn't matter in my case. 
---
But I do know that there have been many people who have been online during the reset who got hit, so it certainly can't be ruled out as a possible cause. 
---
There is no "one thing" we can point to as the cause.
---
See I bought the grognak bundle for the outfit but this one is meh. I just wanted the grognak stuff so my character could look like she's completely lost her shit and decided to run around in tribal garb. 
---
Although, I guess running around looking like a methed out harry potter works for that too.
---
Just wait for them to make bug fixes. They event isn’t going away anytime soon.
---
How's the ammo crafting for that gauss mini?
---
May we have.
---
the rubber banding health has been happening since day one and can happen with any enemy
---
Where about near Bravo are you? Most people seem to be nuking directly on the mine, so if you're no further than Substation PX-03 then you should be just shy of the danger zone.
---
True.  In fact, you probably don't want to hit it dead center because non-PA players are probably going to emerge overburdened and in Hazmat gear, and having a way to quickly get out of the range of the Nuke Zone is very much welcome.
---
Interesting idea about awarding perk coins. It would keep people playing after completing a season.
---
Do these firefly lights tank the fps of anyone else? It takes about 5 or 6 in a room.
---
They started putting the free 1st stuff on the main Free page instead. The round woven rug and the sleazy hotel bed were the 1st items for the month.
---
Its bad but like I also have a sub heavy weapon I use. I use the gauss mini when shit hits the fan. Can’t wait for the legendary perk system to release. My first investment will be that damn ammo crafting perk so that way I can stack it with ammo smith
---
I still have the mod on &amp; block trade &amp; global chats. I've yet to see a conversation in weeks (from EU or local).
---
Thanks for playing. Better luck next time.
---
Damn, I’ve never used a shotgun really and never had that fun ‘issue’ with other weapons. Damn you Todd!
---
Nice one! :)
---
2000 atoms and we will give you a outfit that removed all hair on your body when you put on, sound good?
---
someone in your group launched a nuke.
---
I'd love that to be a feature
---
Check your quantity selection. Some are confused by the 1x, 10x labels which don’t correlate with the amount of ammo you wish to sell. 1x might equal 3 rounds for example, 10x might mean 30.
---
They look very human to you?  Two arms and two legs don't make a human.
---
In reference to the auto complete never had issues before and logged in to find this happened to me too. So here it is a month plus after this issues and it's still happening. We have 2 weeks left to finish up this run and I'm at rank 83 of the Legendary Run. I logged in today and found all but one of the weekly and all but two of the daily auto completed with no SCORE awarded. I'm livid! I submitted a ticket but their website says they can't help with it. They gave a few extra challenges a day, but losing out on 9,000+ SCORE this week really hurts.
---
Edit: And I feel you on the 8 person for the event (even though over only dinner it three times). One time there were 4 of us from my group and 1 random level 34 (who just died the whole time). It was a nail biter to get it done before time ran out.
---
Kind of. The plan is what you really want though.
---
There was a nuke at this point. I didn’t think about it at first.. but why do i get quest completed for someone else’s work all of a sudden? That sucks..
---
Yeah I know, which is another point. Why not make a "CryptidSlayers" prefix? +50% against Cryptids?
---
You're joking, right? xD
---
And that completes the mission for him? If so, I gotta do that with all my alts. Team with them (all less than level 5) and they get the mission completed.
---
Cuz it’s a gaaame 🐼
---
Bro, OFCourse, i thought it was quite funny but I guess it missed 😉
---
You know that feature of the mod where you can see someone in blue if they have the mod &amp; on your server, never in my life ever seen that, and I've gone out of my way looking.
---
Thanks for playing.
---
Exactly. That’s why it’s still an issue. Know one knows what causes it or can reproduce it. Heck we don’t even know if it is a console vs pc issue because know one says that when complaining.
---
I believe it's the chest that activates the sound.
---
Yea that would be neat but considering there are very few cryptids i wouldn't see it as viable as any other prefix
---
Unfortunately I’m south of the silo, by an oil seep. It’s in a tranquil canyon area, but it’s almost due west of the mine. Found the spot well before I knew ACP was in the works. But seeing posts from the last couple of weeks and pics of various nuke patterns, I really underestimated the blast radius.
---
at the risk of sounding like a broken record for repeating what others have said that you've apparently chosen to ignore, nuclear winter exists.  If you want to pvp why not do it against others who actually want to pvp?  instead of taking on 1 guy and continuously getting slaughtered.   There are better ways to get resources byt why should I limit myself to only doing one or two things instead of all of them?  especially with events going on.  set up collectors in camp and workshop and gather the resources during downtimes between events.  Didn't think I'd have to explain something so obvious
---
It’s rare but only really has aesthetic value, the plan allows it to join your legendary drop pool
---
I played it without dropping (had the event icon pop up) but I don’t recall if it was a teammate who nuked or not
---
That changes nothing of what I said.
---
I was kinda disappointed at the end of wastelanders there’s the one quest where u talk to the army guys and ur prompted with several dialogue choices one being “im the mistress of mystery” and one girls like hey we’re gonna talk later and you don’t...(I musta missed my opportunity or there was no dialogue after)
---
Define low level?  I'm still at 150ish, but I only died once, I ended up reviving my group with a bunch of level 400s.  I feel like I'm lower leveled because I stopped playing for about a year.  That being said my friend ended up playing it with a level 32, and a level 55.
---
Exactly. My first Earle run had me joining a group who would just barely clip the location. We ran it three times, and each time my non-armoured ass was able to Marsupial my way up the cliff on the left and instantly be out of the zone. Made going through it all three times fun and rewarding, especially since I didn't need to scrounge up a dozen of each crop and flux just to repair my CAMP afterwards. It's helpful, it's courteous, and it's arguably better to nuke the spot between the mine and the train station because there's more flora to harvest there, anyway.
---
Did you notice any stealth damage multipliers? I didn't see any, so could the be turned off for this event or broken.
---
Yes it does. Same for private groups. I got the quest completion and the PS4 trophy when I was teamed up with my friend and he launched a nuke.
---
Oh okay so I have just been that unlucky I guess haha. 
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
Neither the plan or meat tenderizer itself are extremely rare. It's just a pain to get that 2% drop chance to work in your favor. However in my case I have gotten the plan 3 times as well as all the mods 3 or 4 times each so. All about the RNG.
---
Just a feature of teams, been that way ever since teams have been in the game.
---

---
You can still do it, it’s still pretty much the same experience
---
the game only tells them to of they try to claim the workshop for themselves which is what they tried to do.  There is no global message tgat goes out saying "this guy took a workshop.  go get him"  the only thing similar to that is when you continuously attack players without them fighting back and gain a bounty.  which i hadn't.
---
Basically the first 50 levels are spent in Forest/Toxic Valley/Ash Heap until you're strong enough to be able to do more content. It's a bit of a grind in the mid levels but that's what you have to do. 
---
If you're on PC send me a friend invite, my Bethesda name is "vertibro". I'll make you some stuff and give you some ammo.  I usually play in the evenings Pacific Time.
---
Not really. Either his defense is crazy high or it's bugged but I wasn't doing super high damage
---
Bobby is my favorite! shes from agents of shield. she has cool sticks that she fights with and shes really strong and nice to everyone except some times hunter her husband
---
The colossus scream draws them in, it never specifies how *far* it draws them in from. Maybe all the wendigo are called in from the area surrounding the mine?
---
" Your killing a few pixels on a screen in a made up world "
---
If this is all you're getting out of fallout I would dare say that it is you  who "Doesn't understand shit" about the franchise.
---
Which is why people are advising to logging off before the reset. Since no one knows what causes it, the best advice is to avoid possible causes as much as you can.
---
So are the new helmets and plans the auto rewards for just completing the event?  And the loot on him is weapons, etc., like SBQ?
---
Yeah I can join adventure mode just not LFG or friends world's
---
Really? I didn’t know that. Now i’m happy again. Thank you
---
Imagine working the chems converter while on chems.
---
What does having a flat surface to walk on have anything to do with low level players? There are plenty of flat areas to walk on in the main arena.
---
I would do that in a heartbeat, especially if I could just buy that damn BOS Elder PA paint! That's the only one I'm missing &amp; I'm really getting sick of farming for it. I do Forgotten Knowledge at least 6 times a day.
---
Radiation Rumble, tons of Xp and sometimes up to 5 or 6 legendaries even if failed
---
It's bs that you don't get mods from scraping power armor to begin with...
---
Yes- it also gives you a chance for the cursed weapons and I’ve also gotten a random legendary reward each time. So you’re just missing an extra legendary / some junk
---
I would say my Meat Cook count has to be somewhere near 100, and I've gotten exactly 1 Tenderizer from it. Never the plan.
---
LoL.  Obviously you’re the one that doesn’t get it.  But hey, keep at it.  You do you.
---
I don't think I agree with your rational, if you don't feel that Fallout 76 is respecting your time and effort then you should seek a different game, I've been trying to get into Deep Rock Galatic lately, maybe try that one, I can assure you that you wont have the same issues as you do with Fallout 76.
---
Or you could just sell or drop them...
---
Good to know. Just began teaming, had been playing solo since launch.
---
With your friend, were you in the silo with him/her at time of their launch?
---
It’s as if the person who worked on BFV’s crappy User Interface also did 76’s UI.
---
I’m sure they’re not losing many, but they are losing some, which seems silly when it’s over such a basic and widely used feature.
---
Remember when Peregrin Took knocks that dwarf skelly down the hole and all those goblins show up? I imagine that Monongh goes deeper than we know and they just have a little community down there
---
Blue screen? I haven’t played yet, but sounds like you might be having some hardware or driver issues. But take that with a grain of salt. I’m no expert.
---
I've been in 2 lobbies in the past 3 days where a SBQ and Earle event started at almost exactly the same time. This feature would have been helpful to those 2 poor souls fighting Earle while everyone else figured they could burn the queen down and then go help. 
---
God help them. They must have been there a while and used a lot of ammo.
---
True, yes. This event would be better if the enemies were at minimum 50. Although with One Wasteland this will change, yes?
---
Yeah, doesn’t look very different from normal PA...
---
Thank you to the dude who told me to VATs the scorchbeasts! Kill them every time now!
---
I heard only if you buy the new Commie PA skin and that it shouldn’t be available otherwise.
---
That is correct, the introduction of NW is what started the auto completion bug. Kind of mind boggling that they still haven't fixed it.
---
My live is fine it's a Bethesda message in game and the game weirds out after so I have to restart the game
---
Is the lamp better than the one on the standard mining helmet?
---
Well maybe instead of giving me shit when you didn't read the wording of what I wrote, I wouldn't have called you a chode?
---
Yes we ran the silo together, but they were team leader and they did the launch.
---
This one gives cobalt flux though and that shit is like crack
---
I know the spot! I've fallen down there a few times while scrounging for Neutron Pods. From my experience, that area should actually be pretty safe. The nuke zones usually don't go past Monongah Lookout.
---
I don’t think it’s available at all. Being that excavator armor was for mining. The vendor at Camden park has all the plans for it. But I don’t think the jetpack is one of them.
---
That’s actually a really good theory!
---
&gt;Legendary Weapons: The Assassin’s legendary attribute now applies its bonus damage to human NPCs.
---
Finally its less useless
---
I assumed it was the helmet - where vocal sounds come from 🤣
---
I think I modded everything but the chest and jetpack.    Kinda lame I have to lose the atomic paint for it.   Likely refund if possible at this point
---
&gt; But I really want some badass wasteland outfits. Something very you know.. falloutish?
---
Oh boy, can't wait for all the people suggesting a billion "tacticool" outfits
---
New hairstyle would absolutely be great though, I agree there.
---
I've gotten the mods plans but the the one for the tenderizer itself...go figure. I think that's all I'm missing.
---
I've created multiple characters to have different builds but I've come to grips with the realization that none of them will have everything that my main has. Not having certain things be account wide was/is a mistake.
---
🤫
---
Ok, sounds like the player has to be in the silo. I'll give a try with my alts., leaving them at their CAMPS to see if they receive credit.
---
Hop on to mine fearlessbitc
---
Maybe level 60, cuz level 50s don't always have decent weapons
---
Makes no sense to do anything like this now when One Wasteland is not so far away
---
Did you fix it somehow?
---
I think I’ll go through a cryo treatment... To be thawed out in 2287.
---
I love this game. The bugs are too funny
---
Well... One Wasteland is coming up soon^(tm) anyways
---
I've absentmindedly done it a couple of times. I will drop the legendary for someone and more if I have some. Like Uranium fever, I just bash them a couple times and that gives me enough damage but it seems lately there is always some douche unloading a heavy weapon on it until it dies. Shameful.
---
This would be a great way to keep old events fresh. Just add some new stuff to the loot pools once in awhile. 
---
I also wish they would add some cool legendary gear once a week for Murmgh. Just a named legendary similar to the survival stuff they used to have. Make it cost like 300 scrip or something.
---
As stated, the Red Scare PA skin in the Atomic Shop has a fully functional jetpack that you can affix to the Excavator torso. It's probable an oversight as I don't think it's intended. I have purchased and affixed in the hopes it will remain legacy if they ever decide to remove it.
---
We all be weaker by then so those green bastards are surely going to be a challenge
---
what ab the cosmos skin for it?
---
Yeah that's what I thought. I was hitting 500's with aid and adrenaline, but seemed really low compared to the Queen. Same build puts me over 1,000's up to 1,400 on the Queen. I find it hard to believe Earle's DR are 3 times greater. I also need to recheck but I run a +50 VATS CRITS and didn't notice any increases for the Crit shots. Normally I would see 500, 500, 700, or something similar.
---
I've seen reports of people who have had it completed and weren't in the silo, so I am not sure if that is a requirement.
---
cripple wendigos
---
ty 4 the advice
---
No jetpack.  But emergency protocols and marsupial with strange in numbers is better anyway.
---
I'm really looking forward to finishing, I've decided when I'm done I will find a new place and build a new camp, maybe do a "spring cleaning" of my inventory and stash. Basically just some cozy housekeeping stuff since I wont have to worry about getting the challenges done. 
---
And it'll be nice when I can jump back in my PA full time since I won't have to worry about missing out on xp to gain score
---
Another reason why this game is rated M, but when people found out how to nuke the queen everyone was begging for more similar bosses in different regions on the map. 
---
It’s just a game and it’s for fun. If people find it too much then don’t watch tv, play video games or heaven forbid read a good book. Evil is in the mind and will never leave.
---
silence foodbuilds
---
Thanks! Fingers crossed!
---
Dunno, but I doubt it. No one has said anything.
---
I've been trying to get the pickaxe but it won't give me one. Funny that.
---
I have a 1\* Bloodied one I currently use, so the cursed one would be a nice upgrade.
---
Why are you using a bloodied weapon if you don't play as bloodied?
---
I do blame you...cause it's entirely your fault, if you were that worried about getting there you'd get there...period, If I wanna do it I show up a minute early or so to make sure I don't get glitched or have to server hop, and I've missed a few because id start a conversation or be in the middle of a fight, it's nobody else's fault you(or anybody else) weren't paying attention, and quick tip the game does have a clock in the pip-boy
---
yes, i've had good luck hopping teams and finding a team that is down.
---
I am trying to ignore that particular...problem with the upcoming patch, with emphasis on trying.
---
Yeh there's literally no need, it puts noobs off and we need them, the more ppl play the better, like any game.
---
Run West Tek and sell the weapons to a vendor. Realistically, selling weapons is the easiest way to wipe out the vendor cap limit while still earning xp.
---
I've affixed to my Liberty Prime paint...since my char stole the tech from the Reds. Hehe
---
It’s not end game.  I had a level 12 player in the group today.
---
I'm a lead farmer mother........
---
I think pistols are going to benefit from the tank killer perk soon. Sounds like its currently a pts thing.
---
But yeah some silencers for revolvers and some new receivers that allow different ammo tupes. A .44 for the lever action would be nice too.
---
Did you have skins applied to any of the lost items?
---
It's flattering to me if someone wants to use a nuke just to target me.
---
No problem, how long will it take tho?
---
Great classic movie
---
The mystery of why there is a harpoon gun in a mine :/
---
VATs finishes them every time, in case you didn’t know.
---
I have a set of BoS III T-60 with Calibrated Shocks, Emergency Protocols and Targeting HUD.
---
8 people max per Instanz
---
Or there is yet still a bigger queen. But you make a good point
---
Because those 8 other people are in their own instance.
---
Instances are limited to 8 people, no more.
---
What happens is a certain amount of people are allowed in one cave so like let’s say you have a team and you event that can be up to 5 people any more then that you get traded to a different event where more people can join the limit for one team or like 5 or 6 you’re not doing anything wrong it just caps out at a certain amount of people if that makes since
---
Sense
---
Their game prob crashed 😅
---
Hey if you’re not going to utilise the bloodied weapon without them build can I buy it from you?!
---
Hmm... You think these dupers can't make more? Why do you think they're trading? To get a mask without effort &amp; then dupe &amp; resell while the masks are rare.
---
Upvote for snarky math!
---
That's ridiculous. This is harder than the SBQ and you can only have 8 people.
---
Still no tenderizer plan.  Only one I need.
---
I dunno, the helmet is sick. But this image doesn't do it justice
---
Normally I would say 'What the hell!  Let them try it!'
---
However, as long as the 8 player cap is in place, I have to agree!
---
theres no current dupe out atm. unless like 2 or 3 people are doing it out of the millions of players
---
Unpopular Opinion: being weaker can bring back some of the lost fun
---
I cant see shit at night I would hate that
---
I tried to join colossal problem using this function after it had started and was not able to enter the mine. While the event was going on :/
---
OK bud...
---
Holy shit it worked! Thank you!
---
1. They should follow...*gah* fortnites example when it comes to season passes. Its pretty good. Even CoD mobile has a great one. 
---
1. FO1st should give you an auto x2 xp boost towards your season.
---
1. If there is a separate season pass it should have another x2 on it. If your paying $30 for a season you should have the easiest time. 
---
1. It should never make this game feel like a job. That defeats the points of games. Should the non buy in players be able to finish it yes, but it should be a challenge. Not a struggle.
---
1. I will never participate in another run if its ran like this.
---
It is now a race between the two of us to see who gets it first.
---
go ahead and do your best to look for one. if you find one you can have a gold star or a cookie. your choice. maybe even both.
---
yeah i'm not waiting half an hour to play the skeleton of a battle royale in FALLOUT might play it if they decide to take it out of beta
---
The first time I logged in after yesterday's patch everything I highlighted was called Paladin Stavros. For the whole play session.
---
tag boss.. kill adds.. rinse repeat
---
There is a minimum level, there is no such thing as a lv 10 earle
---
Enjoy empath.
---
gta encourages this because they want you to have to buy shark cards
---
It might but I honestly doubt it. Bosses rarely scale down in environments like One Wasteland, on the contrary, chances are that they'll get scaled up.
---
Earle is level 110, he probably won't get scaled in either direction but I'm willing to bet that the Queen (lvl 95) and the Imposter (70) will get scaled up to be brought in line with the new top tier of their own family tree. :)
---
Yawn.
---
But the question is "What is fun?"
---
I don't disagree with you, the game will become challenging again and could definitely bring life. But for some people that may not be nearly as fun as steamrolling one's enemies if that makes sense.
---
Great, so I have to get lucky to be put into the starting 8 otherwise I'll never do it
---
So much for rng... I have no idea how many time I've done this event with all my 5 characters. But only one got all of the tenderizer plans. Plan for the tenderizer itself and for all 3 mods. The other 4 characters only got the apparel.
---
There is an excavator jetpack now
---
Wow great 👍🏻
---
Wait y’all can do 8 people I’ve been capping out at 5 people
---
I think it was the 2nd event I ever did that gave me the plan.
---
Don't overlook your misc. tab, either. Gunpowder can stack up on you quickly, and does have weight. I always seem to miss it when I'm trying to manage my weight issues.
---
Just finished. Thanks so much!
---
This. I get my sneak bonus at SBQ and many other events while the rest of my team is not sneaking. This information is not 100% accurate and should not be described as such, as its going to lead to more confusion and false info getting out there. May be a bug etc. that happens occasionally or in certain circumstances if it does, but it is not a definite.
---
My point is that I run LOTS of events &amp; dailies, as I'm sure many others do. In the course of doing these you end up with tons of plans. Some stuff will sell to low level players, but the rest just take up inventory space &amp; weight. I've got 2200 hours in this game accross 5 characters. There should be a way for me to dump that excess for a least a minimal amount of caps on a robot vendor. Just dropping them on the ground for nothing means I wasted my time running those events &amp; other than xp get nothing back for the time &amp; resources used. 
---
How many other players have the same...i see player vendors sometimes with 50 to 150 plans for sale. The servers have to keep track of that. Getting a few caps removes them from the game &amp; lightens the load on the servers. Something is always better than nothing. 
---
Just telling players to dump their loot on the ground to me disrespects the players time investment. I don't even bother with most of the legendary weapons in the game, much less useless ammo &amp; other items. A few caps isnt a lot to ask.
---
I got a refund for it for a different reason lmao.
---
We will see my friend
---
Ohhh. Okay thanks, just saw it on there. Still pretty far away so that’s cool lol
---
Donate to low level players
---
I like the look of those too but wasn’t around for them initially
---
Harpoons are common mining equipment in West Virginia obviously lol 😂
---
Yes, seems like a great way to spend the stimpaks lol. ill keep a lookout for a vampire weapon then, thanks for the recommend :D
---
How does this work? Is there a way to prevent it if it's still possible?
---
It's fun and encourages teamplay :D
---
200 Gold limit a day...
---
It didn’t work once when I was on today too.  It also failed a few of the prime cuts events even though I killed everything
---
You know it's gotta get deafening down there when THAT goes on!
---
Sometimes I need marsupial for camp building. After that, I just clean it up because my character only has 3 int.
---
The public teams are your best bet, just scroll through them and find one with a few lower levels. Also try using your mic to just say 'hi' when you see team mates. You would be surprised by how many players just play on mute.
---
GT HASHMAN VII
---
I'm a working Dad and I only play a few hours each night, at best at the moment, i'm Australian EST. But feel free to add and/or join me.
---
yep, in all my RPG's I've always hated the idea of using drugs to get ahead. Bobbleheads and magazines I just do the generic "oh i should save this for an important time, but then I forget to ever use it at all" bit so I don't use those either.
---
What platform do play on?
---
I love these posts. This is a game that barely runs, half the intended features dont work, half of the features that do work are unintended bugs, and yall want all these additions. lmao
---
No problem and good luck out there. Don't let stuff like this get you down.
---
Most Wastelanders are pretty swell and in my experience encounters like this are pretty rare.
---
I only had one spare bit will keep you in mind if I get another.
---
Nope, he doesn't scale. Solo or in a team, no difference.
---
That's by design, and has been that way from day 1. Brahmin out from should've told ya.
---
What are they mining? Whales? Oh wait, yes they are.
---
Yea totally
---
Its never in my favor for these events.
---
Honestly it isn't that good and neither is DR and ER. If you are trying to tank I would argue that having the secondary effect of Sentinel or Cavaliers is more important than Vanguard but if you combine the two it is the best for high health builds
---
Day 1 was yesterday for me
---
They say 440 ish you hit diminishing returns...but man, some mobs just seem to ignore all armor altogether. Level 62 charred ferals take half my health with one hit regardless of my DR...who knows...its fo76...
---
Absolutely agreed, I do clothing mods in the Fallout 4 modding sphere and I'd happily provide either free meshes or concept art if it meant we could get some more impressive outfits in the atomic shop. It genuinely worries me that Bethesda seems to skip over such low hanging fruit when it comes to designing their ATX content, many classic outfits from F3 would sell incredibly well.
---
I got the same weapon from her a few weeks ago
---
Or they could’ve just kept their word and made the atom shop P U R E L Y cosmetic, not add something that violates their original plans
---
No I mean just accessories like the free stares truck. It serves no purpose other than looking cool and taking up space (not budget). I mean I’d like a pile of barrels or stacks of crates to use to make a military base camp look that much more active.
---
You might be surprised to learn that the rest of us have known about A Colossal Problem for months.
---
Jesus christ...
---
How about “for those waiting for a certain item to be added to the atomic shop”
---
I’d love to see actual working shelves. I get tired of using the carpet glitch cause it takes so long to get everything just right.
---
I've found specific traits like zealots and ghoul slayers that are -15% damage are more effective than overall DR
---
Yeah that stuff would be great. You could actually make a junkyard if you had some junk
---
I sell all my plans for 11c at my camp. Been doing this since the vendors came out. From time to time, I get to make a newbie very happy by selling him 100 different plans.
---
Can we update The Crater to actually look as good as Foundation does too. Look I know they're Raiders but come one.
---
Give us a The Pitt vibe.
---
Redesign?
---
I can't even get into a game. Make it to the loading screen and that's where I stay. 🤦
---
Not really, il link a write up that another user did that explains things pretty well.  The TLDR is after 300ish+ resist your better off using a mixed -15% enemy damage set. (Ex. Mutant slayer right arm, ghoul slayer left arm, troubleshooters right leg, etc)

---
The visual effect of night time shortened but the actual times did not. For the perks and the Nocturnal effect, what matters is the time on your Pip-Boy, not how dark it is outside.
---
And the day/night cycle in the game is not real-time. IIRC, 12 minutes real time is one hour of game time, or something like that.  It’s definitely compressed, that I know. So in a 2 hour play session you’ll see the virtual time shift by 10 hours, I think.
---
Angry turtle confirmed me he'll make a video on it. So let's just wait.
---
thank you for contributing to the conversation. your constructive criticism is a boon to us all.
---
Even the reclaimed mining helmet is 5% chance. With people already killing earl in 2mins solo, it’s just a matter of time before server hoppers have plenty of duplicate items.
---
As much as I like Crater's aesthetic, I agree. It looks like it's still under construction, which is cool, but once the BoS comes marching in they're gonna need some actual walls.
---
Nah keep some stuff rare.
---
Oh i do that too.   All my bobbleheads are on display and magazines in racks....I should sell them
---
My theory are pc player are more organized then console player and probably don’t spawn it unless they have 4 players
---
Console aren’t as organized as much and spawn the event with random ppl
---
Greetings to a fellow Aussie.
---
My wife and I ran the event twice yesterday and each time managed to complete it with a group of 5 (only just the first time, and with a good 5 mins left the second). Having said that it would be good if
---
* When in a team you had the option to join on your team leader at the start of the event - or give the team leader the option to take their entire team into the event.
---
* Give us some time to loot after the death of Earle - or somehow auto-loot the room. It is just mean spirited to force us to leave all those screws behind
---
* Fix it so if you do crash during the event that it lets you rejoin
---
Realistically, you could buy it and then get a refund as it's broken.
---
Same. Load screen before getting on a server just stays on the load screen.
---
Wait wait wait...what plushies?
---
Never tried all I know is I can see loads better and it looks the business too.
---
It's a....public.......server.  PUBLIC........SERVER......
---
Would be nice for sure. I am usually in pacifist mode, but sometimes take a workshop when low on fusion cores, and needing to dig through sub menus before doing so is a pain. Maybe if there was an option integrated into the pop up for taking over a workshop?
---
Same for PVP, sometimes I'm getting slapped and get in a mood to slap back, but by the time I've changed my settings the other person has left.
---
It is really annoying lol I’ve hard carried 3 of them in a row... but it is what it is
---
This event is hell for melee users. Especially stealth melee users
---
Not wrong though.  These comments always get downvoted, but they aren't wrong.
---
The way it going to work player will sync up (buffed) to the enemy lvl just like in ESO? Or Bethesda doing a different type of scaling for fo76?
---
This is why people are keeping their vending machines and stash boxes as far away from spawn as possible, but the only guarantee is to never have a vending machine at all until Bethesda fix it!
---
Each and every one of us has a preference when it comes to play style. I for one have always favoured stealth; can't beat the thrill and satisfaction of a sneak attack, picking enemies off one by one. However, stealth as a build is almost entirely lost on this game, but there is a workaround. I run as a Rifleman primarily, but I can just as easily switch to Heavy Gunner/Shotgunner/Slugger.
---
Strength: with 8 points allocated to this stat I can fully max out damage output in all three aforementioned categories. 
---
Perception: with 13 points allocated to this stat I can fully max out Rifleman. In fact the only cards I switch in this stat are Tank Killer and Glow Sight, which are entirely situational, the latter being more effective in nuke zones.
---
Agility: with 11 points allocated I have Action Boy and Adrenalin maxed out; Adrenalin is really effective and will serve you well in any combat situation with waves of enemy spawns by increasing your damage output with every kill up to 60% (I think) for 30 seconds and refreshes with every kill.
---
Luck: with 8 points allocated to this stat I have Bloody Mess (3*) active at all times, which increases damage by another 15% in the vast majority of kills. 
---
My advice to you is don't get too fixated on builds, I do just fine and routinely whip out my Gatlin Laser (with added fire damage) when the situation calls for it. Have fun experimenting and always remember this is your game every bit as much as everybody else's.
---
Seriously. You people ask for these ridiculous additions when major quests and events are bugged for large portions of the player base. Things like auto complete of Atomic Run, mobs failing to spawn in Primal Cuts, respawn issues in ACP. Priorities man, priorities.
---
Bugger
---
Yeah, I was thinking a bug too. If i remember correctly in the vault 94 instance sneak worked normally too.
---
Too exploitable by griefers
---
ty4 the advice. i didnt have a base b4 because i think its more fun to explore and pretend to be a scavenger but now i think i need to build a base. i think i had alot of junk because my friend said i should pick the perks that make junk way less so i can carry more. i only carry food and water and everything else is my guns and armur and junk
---
I was just thinking this!
---
Have u not ever wanted to fire w cool looking mounted weapon from the civil war? Maybe that’s just me
---
Just commenting to say anyone on ps4 that needs it, I killed it 15 times yesterday, once with just 2 people message me going at it today too
---
Is there a spreadsheet of rewards for the new treasure hunter rewards with the drop rates?
---
Or jus change PVP so you have to walk up to them and hold a certain button, then have a 15 second timer and you can both attack. The current pvp doesn’t make any sense, I want to be able to defend myself while also not initiating pvp by misfiring a shot
---
When does season 2 start?
---
Totally agree and the queen too they literally do nothing but stand there and watch you do all the work
---
Two things OP.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
1.) It’s one thing to not have CS tools ready at launch but after two years and they still can’t exit player profiles in any way? This means 0 resources were allocated by higher ups to do so.
---
2.) I could instantly see how much of a grind the run was going to be, once the number crunching came out for how much of a grind it was I said to myself “time for a break”. 
---
I really hate this whole idea of “seasons”, which offer content only for a limited time and try to guilt you into playing one game a shitload of hours so you don’t miss out.
---
Above all other things that make me stop playing a game, this kind of manipulation is at the top. And apparently it’s super common now. I’ll take loot boxes over this because then the loot won’t ever be closed to me at least.
---
I keep hoping that the assholes who make these decisions just get fired someday.
---
&gt;Just had them lengthened!
---
Yer gonna be repairing yer gun nonstop lol. Congats.
---
There's an official PTS forum you should be posting on.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/category/312/fallout-76-pts?language%5B%5D=en I believe, that's the link I get anyway
---
A full day in world is 72 minutes. Thats an entire day and night. 3 seconds real time is 1 minute in world. This is all from memory and may be a little off.
---
I see what you did there; hilarious.
---
Instead we get a minor Unstoppables villain??
---
All the wendigo are the wendigo that the colossus "create"
---
Hahaha have an upvote
---
For me it’s definitely all the pieces of clothing, I’ve hoarded a copy of every single one I’ve found since beta..
---
Yeah I figured, but was kinda hoping there was something to make it easier to make.
---
Gatling plasma does that job for me right now, don't have gauss mini unlocked yet
---
It works on weapons under 200 fire rate but not as effective and seems dependent on server latency. 
---
Explosive effect also seems to double fire rate, as the effect works on an explsove 10mm I have that only has like 80 fire rate (with explosive, would only be 160ish)
---
Had a level 13 and a 19 in our instance last night. We still dropped Earl, but in my opinion they were just leeches. They need to have a minimum level to participate. Could have saved a few thousand rounds and a repair kit if we would have two contributing players instead of the leeches.
---
Realistically the entitled ones are those who join these events knowing well that they can contribute little if any to the end goal. Kinda like the low levels hiding at queen fights.
---
I have played this game since day one, spending hours grinding for gear/levels to get to engame levels. I'm all for helping new players, but more often than not when I do they follow me like a lost dog begging for handouts. For them to be able to join a endgame event and leech rewards is just wrong. More so when them joining said event causes part of my team to be placed in a instance by themselves.
---
They should definitely lift the 8 player cap. There might be a server performance reason why they cap it but I kinda doubt it. It's not like it's a hard event but i'm sure there are people out there who tried to join a friend in the event and got put into another instance.
---
I did one too, guys range from 20 something to 100, disappeared during the fight, only one another guy fought together with me, beat Earle when there’s 20 seconds left on the timer. When I rushed out of the mine all participants magically showed up lol
---
Sure did. I would have been toast if it didn’t!
---
Same with silos. I was in one earlier with another friend in sneak, and then a buddy stomping around in PA. We were fine despite him not sneaking.
---
The question I have is how is bolstering that great??? Yeah with sentinel is probably good but vs vanguard sent. don't understand how bolstering would be any better than that other than you could use a bloodied weapon and still die easier
---
They might have got the bug then, which really sucks
---
Block, ignore forget move on. Can you block people on discord, I'd do that also.
---
What bug?
---
One benefit to being on a public team. When you get the respawn glitch you can force close and rejoin.
---
The best place Is watoga or You can take the x 01 from an Enclave terminal or the ultracite from the BoS quest line
---
i think i had a lot because i only have my guns and armor and food and water but everything else is junk. my friend told me to pick the perks that make junk way less so i can carry more
---
Just wanted to remind you before the reminder that I am at level 100. Didn't buy a single level nor did I play every day. I also rarely used XP buffs and I am not a bloodied build.
---
I find it amusing people can be so confident and wrong at the same time.
---
They have trapped him for his crimes
---
Beef Madras will do that.
---
You can't smear new players, they just want to have fun as well and scope out the event.
---
After I read your first paragraph and half of the second...BLOCK
---
No worries!  I knew it was really accelerated, but never watched the clock, so to speak.
---
Block everywhere and move on.  Unless you lied to them to get them to buy the item, you have no reason to interact with them again.  Even if you did lie, not much he can do, but shame on you.
---
Don't waste any more energy on the guy, delete him from your life and move on.
---
Respawn bug, it's all over this sub. Happening a lot on colossal.
---
The "magic" guns, will literally shred the current bosses in seconds.  
---
And PvP isn't the only reason I want these guns out, it's because they simply don't even belong in the game, and they've been duped so far that they don't have the same special title as they used to have, they were left in the game because there were only a few hundred at most, now there's literal millions of them  
---
This is just how I feel on PC, maybe it's different there, but I know for sure that it's a problem that needs to be addressed, be it by deleting them, nerfing them, fixing the bugs associated, anything. They need to be addressed as they just ruin all the activities in the game  
---
i couldn't even loot the yao guai during primal cuts because someone was just spraying the landscape from the center pole and not letting anyone get a chance to grab the acid and springs off them.   
---
Couldn't even enjoy a few of the "A Colossal Problem" events i've been into because someone will kill the boss in seconds after they hop in, or after they've clipped through the wall to get to it.
---
I am not one of those but many people do think those things are not pointless  (!). That weird, I know.
---
It's the sad part of the workshop because if You Need One You can change server
---
Just don’t do them bro
---
Everything isn’t supported to be a reward
---
Get gun artisan perk i guess
---
Try your blueprints. Sometimes it puts machines like that in its own blueprint.
---
I'd love to add wendigo armor to my cryptid theme character.
---
Long limbs would be cool.
---
You mean if you’re dead when Earle was killed, you spawn outside? Happened to me twice, didn’t get to loot the corpse. But those guys disappeared way earlier. When I change ammo or fix weapons, there was nothing but silence lol
---
To be honest, why tf do you feel the need to go PvP. This is now a single player game, as it should have been from day one. Get on with your quests and leave everyone else to do their thing.
---
Monorail elevator on the top of the Building and in the lucky hole mine.
---
Is this a limited time event or perma boss?
---
This sounds exhausting. That's why at the most I'll message someone via psn.
---
Block this dude and move on. He didn't have to but that gun at that price and you weren't under any obligation to invite him to team.
---
"accidentally" buy an atom shop item, get it reimbursed and keep it, win-win.
---
Stupid fucking workaround for bullshit business practices, but WTF are you supposed to do?
---
The queen is different tho , event reward is base off  dmg you do with the minimum being 1500
---
Yea you can make about 108 Ultracite 2mm in one click with ammo smith. Even with super duper its a pain. Great gun though. Love the feel of it.
---
Whats the issue, I ran it with 2 others just earlier. There's even a 12 second speed run. Max your build this event isn't for the faint of heart
---
I'm not sure what that dus bit I'm shure ganna find out
---
Over priced items do piss me off, that being said I don't have to buy them and everyone has the right to charge what ever they want. Some people are just arse holes and need blocking, 
---
I had a stranger experience on a trade post the other day, guy was asking for a weapon, I replied saying I have one and wanted an armour piece in trade. The piece he came up with was worth a lot more than gun he wanted so I told him I would give him some flux. He went away and asked around and decided not to trade, was annoying but I didn't mind. Then out if nowhere a completely different person sent me a private message with loads of abuse telling me I should be ashamed of myself because I was trying to rip off a new player.
---
All we can do is block these idiots and vent about them on here I suppose.
---
could be in your stored items. Sometimes the game wants to build a second one rather than use the stored one.
---
If I hadn't been able to buy plans from players, I would have never been able to complete the challenge that has you make different kinds of armor, make different recipes, etc.   Plus plans are one of the fun reasons for visiting players' camps.
---
How much you sell Ultracite for?
---
On one hand I totally agree.  But on the other, I didn't go near the SBQ until I had my X01 and heavy guns ready, \~lvl70ish.  I get wanting to see the event and check it out.  But some things just aren't for you yet.  End game content at level 30 is one of those things.
---
No lol if you don’t have 1st memberships then just sell/toss some items 
---
No need to have 2000 steel sitting on your stash box when you can craft them into bullets 
---
Also look into weight reduction perks at rank3 they are 90% reduction which is a lot
---
I'd love to see some seriously dark stormy nights where visibility is like actual night time, not the friendly star lit expanse we currently have. I'm  not complaining,  star lit expanse is beautiful, but would be nice to have a night of absolute terror now and then.
---
They brought back the Thanksgiving chair and table but not the shelf? Why? I need that.
---
Because the BOS/Enclave are aesthetically boring af?
---
While I agree with the overkill on goofy cosmetics, BoS/Enclave isn't the answer. 
---
You just go from goofy to boring. Yay! The Fallout equivalent of military pron! No thanks.
---
it has
---
I broke three guns and the event failed with like 5% left to go.
---
I've been in the wasteland since Fallout 1 buddy.
---
end of September I believe. Supposedly this season ends on the 8th and there is supposed to be two weeks break in between
---
I have wanted to, and I’ve done it better by being able to carry it around
---
Enforcer: definitely the right answer
---
Without the shotgun perks they’re not gonna be really good weapons. I run a bloodied shotgunner and he’s ridiculously overpowered. My friend runs a full health shotgunner and he’s crazy op too. So it sounds like you need to respec. Look at trying to get the fancy pump action. It’s pretty hard to beat when it comes to pump actions. Also look for a quad faster reload double barrel. It’s without a doubt the best you’re going to find in shotguns.
---
Love it! My photo roll is basically weird things I’ve found in bathroom stalls. My favorite is one in the WhiteSprings employee workshop (I think) that has “flush twice dammit” written in graffiti about the toilet.
---
Obviously the Bears are unionized.
---
One does the work. One checks it twice. The last supervises the whole thing while not really paying attention.
---
Oh well to each their own I just think it would be cool ya know. Just ideas
---
Yes, but we will find a way to break something else to give you this.
---
We have new players all the time on xbox since it's on the game pass. Its regular to see people around the 1-30 range on most servers I hop to
---
15 times? That’s a lot of ammo my dude
---
He's got a higher resistance than the Queen (400/400/500 vs 300/300/300) and has a damage ignore of 80% vs the Queen's 70%. They both have 32,000 health though. You can do about 60% more damage on the Queen than you can on Earle. 
---
If you believe that you're rubberbanding, just hit a spawn or two outside of vats. You can see really quick whether you're being effected or not.
---
In the narrative with both Maggie and Earle they mention a previous mining disaster in Monongah Mine. In Earle's holotape he says he can hear them digging. Guess they got there.
---
Does flechette make it act like a shotgun? Like will shotgun perks works with it?
---
Could this work with a magic gatling laser? I have a bunch of those that I wanted to try. I'm also doing my first nuke tonight so I thought I'd use it to feed Earle.
---
Along the left side of the area is a tunnel leading to where he spawns to the exit. This is also safe from everything except the minions, but they all clump together and are easily removed by any area of effect. You can even headshot earl without him spitting on you.
---
Sounds like that’s the real challenge... public server with power armor heavy gunner ruining stealth...
---
Knowledge is power! HeHe
---
Yeah but I can't take my OP character to NW. So I have to settle for burning down players like you at workshops.
---
Well its a tough event and having 1 or more guns that are useless negatively impacts everyone else. Meat week is for scoping out and hanging around. Earle is for people who are going to put in work. You can't afford deadweight on a tough event especially when it requires alot of resources to finish and only 8 people can do it at a time.
---
What kills me isn't the attacks though. It's getting feared right into one of the dozen large spots on the map that will drain my health. Then if you don't get revived, you'll end up waiting 60+ seconds for the timer to end and let you respawn.
---
Not entirely sure but it’s just changing the projectile type so I doubt it
---
They need to stop adding stuff and just fix the game
---
I haven’t had this problem but this sub has a lot of posts from salty folk who respawned outside the event.
---
You seen the rocksy method?
---
Usually just rock one piece with the rest UNY for a bloodied build. Helps a bit with damage
---
Probably not
---
It’s the only one I’ve seen, was a great find.
---
Thanks, he stopped playing when the game pass left though. A bit annoyed he didn’t give anything back.
---
Awesome 👍🏻👍🏻 no problem
---
I can confirm that melee gets sneak damage on both Earle and Queen in PS4
---
Sense some saltiness in your replies may I ask why
---
I am now one of those folk 😂
---
I’d also appreciate a floor that the colossus can’t fall through repeatedly...
---
Nono no wait. When we talk about vanishing doubles we don't mean that all your current doubles will vanish for nothing. 
---
It means that currently,under certain circumstances,if you drop a double it may vanish preventing you from obtaining a future coins. 
---
All your current doubles will stay with you.
---
Diseased cranberries were all named Carla for me yesterday. Today, Mama Mumbles was OldManPooh.
---
So make Hunters apply to them. Cryptid Hunter.
---
Congrats, I just hit level 99 today. Should get to 100 tomorrow!
---
LOL.  Yeah, it was breaking my brain reading people call it a 'cap'.
---
Nice lol
---
If it’s the chest, I wanna put a liberty prime helmet on a red scare chest
---
Farming wendigos in general is a lot easier than clearing out the sugar grove, imo. Even without ACP
---
They should probably not allow bloodied players to join either if low levels shouldnt be.
---
I spend most of the event picking up bloodied builds, that get feared and than downed by environmental damage.
---
I play bloodied too, but found much better survivability not being at 20% health, and was able to keep up dps longer than the 20% bloodied ones that would do a burst, than die. 
---
 But each to their own.
---
That's to funny, actually burst out laughing. Now my mrs wants to know why... Yet when I play she doesn't wanna know. 😂🤣
---
Simple answer is no, go full bolstering if all you want is DR. Look at it logically, the lower you health the more DR, so when taking damage you become harder to kill. Now with vanguards that's reversed, once you take damage you become easier to kill. 
---
I use unyielding on both my bloodied and junkies build. My junkies has 1 point in blocker, nerd rage, evasive and dodgy. I run full health most of the time but its nice to know that when I get mobbed I can still walk away.
---
I don't know you but I like you
---
Except that any duplicate perk cards disappearing is exactly what they are saying.
---
Explain?
---
Oftenly
---
This right here. My husband and I play together and used to enjoy this game even with all its bugs and glitches. But the grind that forces you to play is so incredibly obnoxious. It’s off-putting and does encourages the opposite of what they’re trying to accomplish. You want daily players? Stop forcing them to play your game. Let us play on our own terms, on our own time. I agree completely, I’d much rather loot boxes over daily logins and grinds to get something. It shouldn’t punish those who have responsibilities and can’t/won’t log in daily.
---
The ones in the atomic shop...
---
I've never played ESO, so not sure. I've uninstalled the PTS client because I don't see a lot of our feedback actually making a difference. :(
---
You’re looking for title suggestions?
---
First off, let me say thanks for posting these. It’s nice I can check out what’s available while on my break. I appreciate it. 
---
Now. Title suggestions. 
---
Why not let the shop suggest the title? For instance this week it’s all a about Grelok right?  Why not “Take a Gre-look at this weeks Atom Shop Deals”.  Or let’s say this weeks sale was BOS related “These bundles are so well priced they’re a Brotherhood of Steal!” 
---
Etc.
---
Like level 40 and lugging all their stuff around every day..
---
As an Australian I am also engaged by the 23 dollar monthly subscription. I do have fo1st but it's still annoying.
---
Does 206 screws from one run count?
---
Because fast traveling was free in the previous games?
---
Go to nexus mods, make balloons not meatpiles and in the description it should say how to, basically drop the file in the data folder and edit the Fo76.ini
---
I like to think they've got a civilization somewhere down below, &amp; have become a rad/industrial toxin-induced subspecies, rather than just the remnants of Appalachia's miners. Because yeah, we'd have killed them all by now.
---
check the homepage and do the math man
---
Still 33 to go so yay double week
---
Imagine gatekeeping a video game 🤣
---
I wasn't aware of it until now, glad to have found it out!
---
The math only works if we knew exactly when double score or extra challenges would come up...
---
Which we didn’t until they did lol
---
no it's not rare at all
---
Not just hair styles. But BEARDS. Proper long lumberjack beards.
---
Does it have anything to do with Meat Sweats giving you more health for 15min?
---
https://youtu.be/g0ShnnGl66M
---
Yeah, it's a prize from Project Alpha
---
Ahhh so the cursed weapons can come from looting him but the new goods are all automatic. Gotcha. Thanks.
---
heck, I just want to be able to keep using my grenade launcher without having to solely rely on a glitched event to restock on grenades even if they nerf it so that you only get 1-2 grenades 10% of the time.
---
Have you checked out the PTS? I have. I stand by what I said: having lowbies run around an instanced event that has a limited number of slots with their wack-ass builds is not a good experience for people.
---
There’s a new outfit coming with the next impossible mole miner event
---
if nothing else, it saves on ammo. It also tears through the lower level wendigos pretty well so when I draw aggro I'll usually run away and then saw on the wendigos working on the highest level guys I can find so they can focus on dps.
---
Who's saying it? There's nothing official about it.
---
so what you're saying is you can't pvp when you don't have an advantage?  sounds like a personal problem that could be solved with a few doses of Git Gud taken once a day
---
And that’s why I’ve been saving tons of caps and weapons
---
There is also a handmade wendigo colossus plushie
---
I'd rather a perfect score done quickly than a bunch of idiots struggling for the bronze rating like last year.
---
It is a endgame event for endgame players. For every non contributing player in the event my investment in ammo and other resources goes up. There is nothing entitled about it. 
---
Little Johnny fresh out of the vault doesn't deserve to  pull from the same loot pool as the players dumping their resources into the event.
---
If you give a man a fish you feed them for a day, you teach a man to fish you feed them for a lifetime. So get out there and teach these vault dwellers how it's done. 
---
If you keep carrying them your not helping.
---
exactly and that's what I did to find a free one.  Amd it didn't take many hops either.  just one.  most of the time the workshops are open in almost every server i join so it's not like it's a hot commodity or anything
---
pc
---
I think you need to be at the part in the quest where your about the launch the nuke to get credit.
---
I dont think it works if you havent started the quest line.
---
right.....
---
Don’t ask questions you are not ready for the answers to.
---
pc master race, I average 60fps the entire time bro
---
What I find frustrating is that I \*have to\* have the PipBoy. The entire look of fully half the outfits is ruined by my fatty retrofuture computer on my arm. Raider outfits look a little half-assed even if I raider-paint the pipboy. The Grognak outfit is right out, and Grelok's armband is ruined by the necessity of the pipboy. It is one more level of goofy on something that is already past the goof limit.   
---
Force me into the secondary pipboy view, that's fine, I already use it anyway because chameleon screws up the regular one. I don't mind if I stand there looking at my arm with nothing on it to others. I'm checking the time. Who knows.
---
If you're strong enough (or sneaky enough) to push through and launch a nuke, then I think you should be able to do the Colossal Problem event. There are multiple Assaultrons in there, and I can't think of how to bypass the reactor one given that you have to run around a LOT to do repairs.
---
https://www.mobigaming.com/2020/05/08/final-fantasy-xi-mobile-new-screenshots-but-will-it-ever-release/
---
That's what people are reporting on the pts. That any current duplicates they have are being deleted. Any future they get arent deleted. Hence why they are saying to not open perk packs till after update goes live.
---
Abd that's exactly what was being say by the other guy replying in here too. Multiple people have said it in threads about legendary perk update.
---
Boy, the cryozone thing would work, if only they hadn't already done that lol.
---
Yes...yes I am. You don't like the pvp rules of workshops, don't claim them.
---
Lagging as a bloodied build in this event is awful. You move around to get a good shot, game suddenly stops from lag and next thing you know theres a respawn thing on the screen. Nothing to even defend yourself with as the lag can freeze the game for a solid 5 secs
---
Nowhere. It'd be a pay and win item
---
You can say that's one colossal mean
---
I kinda enjoyed it.
---
Wait actually lmao I’ve been biking the queen/surrounding area for flux farming and I didn’t realize I was getting the CP event
---
Yikes this got a bit of backlash
---
Which skyrim set lol
---
Deathclaw Gauntlet and Molotovs say hi!
---
Also multiple serums require bone.
---
Welp if you can't beat them join em
---
If I ever get a solo run of ACP I just grab my .50 cal and farm ultracite ammo
---
Funny thing is I've only gotten 1 tenderizer but 3 plans.
---
Skyrim 76
---
Some PC players have complained about it and the levels people have are similar on console and PC.
---
The issue is ether no players in the PTS tested this event for low levels and how it affects this, or Bethesda will be fixing this with one wasteland.
---
im just that person with 400+ plans in my vendors and stationed near the 76 vault and just server hop and make profits from 10 to 100 caps altogether from low levels and people just starting the game 😎 lol
---
Didn't think of it as I always play a female toon, but yes!
---
The extra challenges would have been great, if I hadn't logged in to find them all auto completed for me.
---
Have you done the prime mod to that laser gatling? 5 cores sounds like a lot, I usually only go through 2-3 cores with a similar gun (two-shot, 40% bashing, 90% weight).
---
Stay away from the reset! It is #1 cause of it!
---
I don't see why low lvl players should miss out on the spoils. If they limit the level then maybe have a server-wide bonus once the event is done... Death Blossoms &amp; Cop a Squatter for example, everyone gets something fron that regardless of whether they were involved or not.
---
There has to be a nuke already on monogah but yeah if you nuke FSP after that it'll spawn the event again
---
That kind is utterly impossible for a Bethesda game. You should know this by now.
---
I heard if you're on PC alt-f4 does this.
---
&gt; once you take damage you become easier to kill.
---
Yep, this needs to be emphasized. It may feel good being at full health with a ton of DR, but as soon as something *does* actually damage you, you instantly lose a large chunk of your resistances. That's scary, and jarring.
---
You can get a plan to craft that, its semi rare ( the plan)
---
Better make it 70 just to be sure
---
You sir are a kind man
---
You've earned this upvote
---
There's a Fallout canon weapon called That Gun, which is a 5.56 pistol.
---
Nice so if there’s a nuke on monogah I can help ppl do the event while still trying to farm flux
---
Did you find a fix for this ? I have this same problem
---
And in fact, there's currently *no* reason why you need to escape.  You don't technically die, so you keep all the stuff you looted, and you get all the event rewards.  So instead of escaping the mine, just go around and loot everything (carefully - the ceiling still counts as death).  You can easily get 300 Screws this way.
---
Agreed
---
Instant max rep with BoS
---
How about they make every weapon viable so it's not just 8 guys with heavy weapons or magic weapons able to do it.
---
Im level 60, almost level 70, using a junkies Gauss pistol and I'm relegated to cleaning up the wendigos because my weapon will break before the boss even has any meaningful damage done to it.
---
Why should I lose out on content in game because I can't do meaningful damage or clear out wendigos faster than my magic shotgunner friend?
---
Btw you can reach end game as soon as level 45 if you're extremely lucky since most weapons cap out at that level.
---
No? You can definitely buy them on the PTS, lol.
---
yeah...no I'll keep doing my thing.   don't like what I have to say, don't read it.  Your own logic right there.  
---
oh and I didn't say I didn't enjoy putting those two little runts, that you seem to have so much in common with, in their place and making easy caps off of them.
---
Wait it is? Huh.. 
---
The more you know
---
Thank you for the information
---
Same thing happened to me I saw the event had 5 ppl in it and I join but get put with a lvl 48 and no one else and my friend in the other instance says there’s only 6 ppl in that instance
---
Well it is Fallout, considering all the other mutations available why shouldn't female characters be able to have beards anyway?
---
Every one I've ever encountered has been so blatantly obvious though. I've been killed by some before but I could tell it was a trap and wanted to see if I could get past it all...but I also dont take junk when I go vendor hopping so no big loss from it.
---
Maybe I have just played too much of the previous Bethesda Fallout games where traps were all over the place so I'm paranoid enough to spot the crap immediately.
---
Nah. 50 would be fine. Not from drops but mamy also find good ones on players vending machines and exchanging scrip. And a well planned build can reach level 50 with fair damage boost perks.
---
Try crippling Earle with perks and killing the spawns
---
To be fair this game has loads of level appropriate content for lower levels. Not so much for those of us who have made it to endgame.
---
No jet pack and responders vendor in white springs for mods no plans tho you have to find those in a mining building can’t remember the name sorry
---
Why does Bethesda think anyone cares about their super heroes shit?
---
Cool, so have I, you should understand that there is way more to this franchise than just killing pixels, and that there is very strong social commentary about flippant use and abuse of nuclear sciences going on from the start.
---
Both is great. Just saying
---
It used to be a lot worse on PC. The workshops are pretty much just PVP zones for the PVP nerds who have nothing better to do because their lives are so tragically sad they have to grief new or lower lvl players.
---
In my opinion there isn't much benefit from the workshops because I can farm those resources in the wasteland much faster than the workshops can produce them.
---
In eso it sync up .. low lvl start with a buffed that make them equal to cp180 base, the closer the character get to cp180 the weaker it yet 
---
I don’t have pst I’m on ps4 but since the update is base off of eso I just assumed it work the same
---
this usually isn’t a problem when you’ve been hoarding 67 repair kits from the scorch beast queen
---
About 10k in my be fixer for my stealth commando, running a group rn
---
Third one casually smoking a cigarette and drinking a glass of milk.
---
&gt;Evil is in the mind and will never leave.
---
It's true, it will always be with us. That doesn't mean we have to encourage it.
---
Zach. You ignorant chode!!
---
It's almost like you have to make choices when it comes to your build.
---
Well as it is with the right build it’s possible to solo it, so it’s still doable (albeit annoying). But if they go through with the absolutely ridiculous damage nerf in the PTS then there totally needs to be a level requirement.
---
2 out of the 4 times I did it lol. That event is actually super difficult, I can’t imagine what it’s going to be like when the nerf hits😬
---
I made an interesting observation last night when Scorched Earth and Colossal Problem both popped at the same time (due to that bug that everyone knows about, where nuking one triggers both).
---
When fast traveling to it, the popup description for Scorched Earth says "Level 50+ recommended"  
---
The popup description for Colossal Problem has no level recommendation at all.
---
So yeah, that's interesting. Not to mention inconsistent.  
---
Maybe they're not bothering with level recommendations anymore after One Appalachia, but I feel like Colossal Problem should be an exception to that.
---
Nah, the people who don't pay much attention to the meta will probably feel the change in time to kill, and slowly change over to prioritizing armor penetration 
---
Or they will ascend like I have and embrace the zero resistance glory that is the Flamer 🔥
---
Shishkebab gonna be epic once it starts doing actual flame damage to enemies instead of energy damage, hoping that change on the pts comes quick lol
---
It should only really affect the end-game bosses. And even that won't happen until they fix the various damage bugs that can be exploited. After this update, people will still be instakilling the queen with bugged LMGs or whatever as soon as she lands. I don't even use damage perks most of the time anymore, something like a quad automatic handmade is 100% viable throughout the game without even a single point of commando. The drop is definitely going to be fine, especially since the less you min-maxed, the less this will affect you
---
I have plenty of adhesive, can help you out if you need.
---
haha funnilly enough we're about to try that with another mate running stealth boys
---
I think what he really wants is for Bethesda to pull their head out of their ass and add a minimum level requirement. If low levels want to waste their time getting shit on, well that's what that free encrypted card is for.
---
Id prefer to see items from original factions instead of more BoS and Enclave garbo. Bethesda needs to get over them.
---
What you want is 4 pieces Vanguard Sentinel and 1 Autostim Sentinel piece. Then add in First Aid, Field Surgeon and Born Survivor perks.
---
If you take a big whack then your Autostim or Born Survivor will proc immediately giving you full health, in PVE you'll be invincible if done right. I honestly can't remember dying on my Junkies Build (full health). For even more health add Life Giver perk and Rejuvenated. Use Pre-War Alcohol for even more, and Psychobuff for even more health and damage. Carry Healing Factor Serums to remove the negative effects in the harder fights.
---
Hope this helps. It should.
---
For more damage then add in Ballistic Bock or High Voltage Hefe, dependant on if you use energy or ballistic weapons, BobbleHeads to, small guns and energy, Explosive to if you have a legacy.
---
Yeah, that sucks.  
---
I find it even worse that you can't join in the event sometimes! The Event-marker on the map just vanishes and if you're unlucky you're stuck with 2-4 players for the whole encounter, and no one can join by foot (entrance blocked) or by fast travel (no event-marker)
---

---
Because that one was just back week before last without the others? Not saying it's right, just that it happened.
---
I'm sorry to say to all high level players complaining about not doing it in over the 20 minutes they gave you because two or three of the eight people are below 50, you're not as good as them either. This event is a joke, just me and a buddy downed him in a minute or two, without min maxing, and in our basic builds. Any vet player should be able to solo this easily within 20 minutes.
---
No you get the cursed weapons as part of the automatic rewards...
---
Idk man, 80 seems like a safer bet
---
Yes this is what I needed thanks dude
---
I don't see why not. I haven't got any magic weapons to test but I've heard a lot about them
---
&gt; Kind of mind boggling that they still haven't fixed it.
---
Kinda not coming from Bethesda :P
---
I think whoever drops the nuke should be able to pick a minimum level. None, 50, 100, something like that.
---
i was farming as well in between primal and cooking events but figured I'd grab the junkyard for even more scrap as well.  I mean I made a lot of caps from killing them but it was a minor inconvenience that could have been avoided if they had simply asked for a team up or something.  the collectors didn't even have locks so they could have taken what they wanted anyway
---
My dumbass died, ran the wrong direction, and left the mine. Live and learn I suppose.
---
I can imagine. I don't even want to try it lmao
---
The same thing happened when I was about level 5, I’ve never played an online game and was kind of nervous about being griefed or killed by high level players. Some level 300+ dropped me tons of plans, aid, and junk outside the overseers house and I was so stoked. Also some High level dropped me about 50 legendaries during fasnacht, I get that he probably ran out of stash space but it was still super cool, the majority of the player base is so friendly I love it
---
Yeah, but keep in mind that this usually takes over a week, so you likely won't get your atoms until next week's lineup
---
Damn earl just disappears half the time for me
---
They can't be removed.
---
Either you or someone on your team put them there.
---
I haven't heard of a way to remove them.
---
Especially considering they just had this happen a few months ago with the stanley skin, except that just bricked the weapon entirely. You couldn't even access it in a weapons workbench to remove the skin
---
Speaking of level floor, maybe not have Earle faze through it. Preventing his sweet release of death?
---
Once again, One Wasteland is going to be the fix for this. Bethesda doesn't usually apply bandaid fixes over leaving things as is until they slot fixes in a larger update.
---
This post triggered an event in my brain.
---
Something is happening.
---
Probably a bug.
---
Ahhhhh, that makes a lot of sense. Not getting the scorched damage bonus from prime weapons is a bummer too. I'm still managing pretty well at least
---
They are human beings that have changed due to consuming human flesh(and a little bit of radiation I presume) It's all there in the in-game lore my man. Although Ghoulslayers might be more appropriate for them as the the traditional definition of a Ghoul is something monstrous that eats human flesh.
---
I thought OP was looking for a non mutation build as stated by his post, so it would be JP &gt; mutation in that scenario.
---
Most veterans should be able to carry said lowbies. I carry a few low levels and excavator wearers everytime I go into the event, the only reason I've ever failed it is bugs, never the time limit.
---
You’re playing with the best build in the game sooo
---
Good shout! I'll give that a go
---
Cop a squatter is different for each person, if someone for some reason clears out your daily spot it just completes for you. It doesn't complete for the while server.
---
If the meter didn't drop we could probably have a more laid back pace but the meter is part of what puts that pep in everyones step. Especially when you can have so many folks just being AFK.
---
Watched a dude essentially solo it (since I  only did like 7 damage a hit) with a powerfist. Took more than 2 mins but mad respect for him and anyone else that solos it.
---
I would have typed "lol" then blocked him.
---
Happened to me twice, really annoying. Also the 60 sec wait penalty after death is also super dumb. It’s like they can always come up with stuff to make their hard work feel bad under circumstances.
---
Well, that's not anything new tbh
---
When you see the “follow me” emote and they’re collaring a legendary to share. 👍
---
Edit: TY to the player who did that at nuked Whitesprings.
---
Yeah I instantly thought of this lmao. The only axe skin that works well is the grognak mace one and that's probably only because for whatever reason it's a super sledge skin instead of an axe skin
---
That's for armor. This one is Mollifying.
---
mad a level 12 didn’t revive you?
---
Will Beth remove them or do I need to relocate?
---
I just wear a clean space helmet. Looks ok.
---
I'm currently with a friend and we have a system atm. I solo it and he gets the last hit in so he still gets rewards from Earle. I can deal sneak attacks while Earle is only looking for me. I don't mind carrying, it's an awesome event so I'm just enjoying the hell out of it
---
I feel like I'm not gonna get it.  I'm missing the spicy mod also damnit
---
No, we knew this ahead of time. Like, about a month ahead of time that this was potentially coming. Ever since Fortifying Atlas was announced.  This is a bonus reward for ‘completing’ the Plastic Challenge.
---
I know, but what more does a 5.56 mod have to do with that gun other than a non unique 5.56 pistol? And how would you tie in a gun found in the Mojave to Appalachia?
---
He was. I'm trying to lure him to the dark side. We have cookies we store in our pouch with that extra carry weight ;)
---
I'd love to go afk and let it run all night.  I've gotten chef hats over and over.  I don't even know why i try to get any good loot.
---
You see we wouldn't mind the low level players being there if there wasn't a player cap at 8 but since there is, we actually want to past the event if you can't contribute to the event then you don't need to be there, I have stoped stiming low levels in that event due to the fact that they a waste there. I will not stim you if you can not fight. With that being said yes we need a level floor but not of 50 but of 90 that way hopefully the people that join will have at least some sort of build.
---
As for making all weapons viable, that will never happen, I'm sorry but your level 45 pipe pistal should not be even close to doing the same amount of dam/s as my bloodied 5mm.
---
Another thing no weapons do not cap out at 45 they cap out at 50 (well the good ones at least).
---
He will be gone, reduced to atoms
---
Seriously this is my biggest pet peeve, next to all guns being left handed....
---
I just wear the pristine miner outfit with a gas mask and a grey knit hat. Looks good enourgh to me to give a unnerving feel to new players (unintionally)
---
Correct, but a lot more than just this went into the math. 
---
And the “potentially coming” thing is exactly what I mean. You can’t do math on a maybe
---
I got Ultracite 2mm dropped,  it was nice. Still wish a stash and not being kicked out of the mine if you die after the boss croaks
---
Just fyi, I don't think a keyring would help reduce the lag. Like it might make scrolling through the misc session less of a pain, but based on how the engine works, especially with stash/junk, it seems like the game always needs it to be at least loaded. So hiding it behind a keyring probably wouldn't reduce the load; I don't think it's possible to reduce it with this engine
---
Helmets ok, to me it looks like it has a nose. I like the rest of it. Allows more mix and match with other things.
---
No, no they shouldn't. I don't want 16 people crammed into that small cave doing fuck all while 3 people actually do the killing.
---
Same with PC lately, due to Steam and game pass.  I’d say 50% of the average PC server population is &gt;lvl100, 40% lvl 101-200 and 10% above that.
---
What's your current perk and armour build?
---
FWIW I run a Vanguard Heavy Weapon build with a Vampire Gatling Gun main, though I am expanding other vampire and medic heavy weapons.
---
I don't think relocating removes them.
---
From what I've heard, all you can do is ask Beth to remove them but since they are not a legit item I don't know how Beth will react.
---
How long have they been in your camp?
---
There are way too many to list. You just need to learn from experience which ones are valuable and not. And it doesn't always make sense, either. My camp and daily route are in the bog, so i pick up a ton of marine armor/BoS underarmor plans, those sell for easy hundreds pretty quickly even though they're not that hard to farm
---
I mostly said that because it was fun to say if I'm honest.
---
But in saying that. I think teleporting us out of the cave is actually the right thing to do. Think about it, people would complain so much about it if they died and lost all their loot after a big end game boss battle, and they'd be right! The boss is supposed to be the challenge, running out of the cave is just supposed to be a cool moment.
---
Also it would be redundant, because we don't lose our loot in public events now anyway. So by teleporting us out they've effectively just skipped the death animation and potentially avoided the respawn bug.
---
It is so anti consumer.  Question.  The Mr Fuzzy ride thing is a single item atm.  Did that come in a set originally?
---
Ah imagine a beard called the moonshiner and it comes down to the lower chest/tummy area on your character
---
Not necessarily true, I refunded the communist bunker bundle and received a full atom refund in about 24hrs.
---
.50 and .45 is where half my caps come from
---
You can use the standard bloodied build. All the perks are the same except for Nerd Rage and Serendipity, so that's six extra points you can use to be creative with. I'd recommend putting them in luck for Crit Savvy and Better Criticals.
---
But I already have like 200 of each kit type. They're heavy and how could people possibly need more?
---
Yes you can. That’s what a variable is.
---
And we got confirmation that it was coming on August 18. That was a week ago. So it didn’t just ‘show up today unannounced’. 
---
It stopped being a ‘maybe’ a week ago.
---
It was a direct reply to another comment, I don’t know why it messed up.
---
There’s a big difference between bloodied builds and low levels though. 
---
Bloodied builds can deal decent damage whereas the low levels can’t really deal much damage or even take care of the wendigo’s, if the wendigo’s were lower levels than what they are now then I wouldn’t mind low levels being part of the event because they can actually do something then.
---
There are many easy solutions to this. I saw somebody suggest that the BoS bring in a scribe that pays you either some generic rewards or a new currency for plans, and then lets you use that in some way to either buy new plans or run something purveyor-esque. We could just sell them to robots for literally a few caps each. We could get an intended way of transferring them between characters so we can at least learn the plans on alts before trashing them. Many ways of doing this, idk why none of them are implemented yet
---
Well I know in the pts they have it where it says you have an unplacable object but I dont know if it consumes budget if its like the empty pumpkin rack it will unless you ask beth
---
At this point I’d take one daily worth 10 atoms than wasted score
---
Stop using teslas until they fix whatever issue they caused with the last patch. 
---
Some people are gonna have to learn to shoot more accurately than "at the ground" but it will fix your fps issues.
---
What I mean is you can say this:
---
“If they make extra challenges I need to do X challenges before that weekend.”
---
“If they do not make extra challenges I need to do Y challenges before that weekend.”
---
Considering you wouldn’t know if we were to hit it or not, you would have to do Y challenges regardless. Then if we do hit it (which we did) you have now done too many.
---
Also, that was the only pre-announced extra score/challenges we knew from a while back. The rest of the bonuses were added randomly when they wanted to. That is what I am getting at. The math has changed from day 1 until now
---
Try over 100. I’m still stingy with them tho for no reason lol. I need to start using them more often
---
He's literally a bullet sponge with a way higher DR than the SQ and even the same health as her though :/
---
Aim for the middle head
---
They didn't care about teaming up they just wanted to PVP because you actually do more damage in PVP at lower levels to "balance" PVP between low levels and high levels. So people will get cheap low level legendaries to PVP other players. It's a cheap low cost low risk way to PVP.
---
[I run a Non Addicted Full Health Sneaky Vats-crit Commando pretty much like this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6b455be&amp;d=sa0sg2p00pg2ph2pi2e82e00c72cu0i11ic2a72ar0an0a02a31ao0lb0lv1lt2lr2l71sb0s00lk2po0&amp;m=5c8&amp;am=13-16-1h-10-1d&amp;wp=w6w6w6&amp;wm=17-17-1j)
---
I fully understand that they want to see what the new event is like but if there’s a level requirement I doubt the low level players will be annoyed as much as higher level players are when they fail the event because they’re the only one able to do damage or kill any of the wendigo’s
---
Some times Earle just starts floating stuck under the floor or above the ceiling so we can dmg him and fail. Has happened twice so far.
---
PC. On Steam.
---
Someone you are friends with doesn’t like you.
---
We knew this was confirmed to be enabled a week ago. 
---
And why does it matter if you did more than needed?  Why shouldn’t there be an opportunity for those that started late or couldn’t play at some point to be able to catch up?
---
*How is this a bad thing for the community?*
---
I've been seeing people say they do take budget unfortunately and can't be scrapped.
---
Many people go around putting these ammo
---
Fac down so it doesn’t seemed as bad (because there is no way to actually remove it and if you scrap/destroy it you permanently lose a % of your camp storage that it took up) they probably invited you to their team and you accepted and that’s all it takes for them to get access to build on your camp
---
P.s people have mixed opinions on it. I personally don’t see the need for it. Takes away a part of the game when there isn’t so much to do already
---
Nooooo. I sold that 2 days ago...
---
IGN is Loooooooser. I'll just take any help I can get.
---
I was running and gunning on my first few but now I get out of range and vats his face to oblivion. Rank 3 sneak, 1 chameleon and 1 H2D. The wendigos run straight past me to, only noticing me if they actually bumo into me.
---
Harder to Detect is an effect btw.
---
Just did it first time on Xbox One X with FO76 installed on an SSD.  I've never, ever, experienced frame rates like I did in Colossal Problem.  This event is hard, compounded to beyond frustration having frame rates this low.  Dropping down the shaft after respawning is a literal slide show, I could probably attribute every death to unresponsive controls due to framerate issues.  Stimpak?  Nah, we don't recognize that button.  Have fun dying and respawning in 60 seconds!
---
Outside of the framerate issues, there are some other "interesting" mechanics at play in the fight:
---
* Fear mechanic instakills you if you run under a burning ceiling.  Or into the drill.  Or into a wall where wendigo spawns can attack uninterupted while you run aimlessly into... nothing.
---
* Even with PA Targeting HUD, Earle is nearly impossible to see.  It's dark, the screen is constantly shaking as the mine is collapsing mid battle, and wendigo's stun lock you.
---
* The exit after killing Earle might as well be invisible.  I ran a full lap looking for it, tripped into a burning ceiling and died.  Spawned outside the mine, waited for the even to end to get my cursed harpoon.
---
I can see potential for this event but until some of the mechanics and bugs are fixed, I'm staying well away from it.
---
I agree with 50, with the sharp drop off of players farming queen how are newly lvl60s going to be able to participate with no way of reliably getting good gear?
---
I didn’t say there should or shouldn’t be, just that it sucks they came right when I was done.
---
Not sure why you feel so strongly about this dude, just  move on already.
---
Keep doing your thing and eventually I'll run into you and burn you down, if you're on XB1.
---
Good one.
---
Don't tell me how to live my life.
---
Grelok's magic works perfectly on dirty barbarian weaponry! /joke
---
You should report this bug to Beth.
---
You sound very bitter dude. Go play another game for a minute.
---
um ok?
---
Happened to me this morning. From what I can tell. People are requesting the appropriate atoms to be awarded so we can buy the tiers that we missed out on. But I’ve seen no instance of that happening yet. I asked for them to give me atoms, no response
---
Oh boy, let's reward the dupers even more and give their hundreds of muled pails additional value!
---
&gt; Legendary Weapons: The Assassin’s legendary attribute now applies its bonus damage to human NPCs.
---
Nice, except assassin's is still literally useless as it's a straight downgrade from multiple other effects that are universal against all enemies
---
&gt; Alien Blaster: Players can now correctly switch back to the Standard Grip mod after applying the Sharpshooter Grip.  
---
Again, nice, but it's still literally useless since they haven't fixed the bugged projectiles and their damage increase hasn't made it viable against enemies higher than level 20
---
It didn't really work out too well for them anyway.  Overall the community seems pretty great though.  every community gas it's few outliers.
---
xbox.....thst explains a lot
---
They are no more human anymore than Super Mutants are, my man.  I know the lore better than you likely.
---
But im not talking about a pipe pistol. I'm talking Junkies Gauss Pistol with hardened reciever and the works.
---
This isn't some start of the game weapon. It requires you to have finished Wastelanders entirely and have enough legendary scrip to have gotten the modules and then some gold for the mods.
---
If It werent for the grounded mutation, I'd be pushing over 400 damage a shot. So yes, my fully modded gauss pistol SHOULD be doing just as well as your heavy weapon.
---
Also both the .50 Cal LMG and Handmade (two of the best weapons for Heavy weapons and Commando) cap at 45, which reinforcea the fact you have no idea what you're saying.
---
No prime mode due to cost of resources.  Didn’t feel like grinding for ultracite cores.
---
Also I’ve only got 2 stars in power user and don’t have optimal mods on my gat laser because i never bothered to grind out the mod plans.
---
Could just be luck then. I had to wait 10 days for one refund and 7 for another
---
Definetly
---
Same here.  I've got a One X and have FO76 on an SSD, and I've never seen anything like it.
---
Free plushies, all for them. Atom shop plushies, hard pass.
---
No. Nocturnal and all night time perks active between 6pm and 6am, regardless of how bright or dark it looks in game. You're not losing any effectiveness or uptime. 
---
And they gave us more daylight in Wastelanders so we can actually see more.
---
You can go junkies or TS/AA/VAMP magic or explosive depends on your perf tbh
---
Because it's an end game event *END GAME* I'm sorry but is a level 1 an end game player? No.
---
As for why they should miss out on the spoils, um maybe because it's rewards are a high tier. That getting in to the hands of a low level will just not be right.
---
Server wide bonus?! I'm sorry but are you SERIOUSLY saying that people that don't participate in the game 3rd hardest event should be rewarded?
---
Death blossoms and cop a squatter are bugged events hell cop a squatter isn't event an event but rather a daily quest for you, also death blossoms was fixed
---
&gt;Bethesda doesn't usually apply bandaid fixes over leaving things as is
---
Are we playing the same game? The game is nothing BUT bandaid fixes!
---
Yeah. I have only had one chance at it and I ruined and gunned myself out of ammo!
---
Door glitch, the only assaultrons you will run into will be in the launch room
---
Griefers are on all platforms.
---
usually im the one who drops things to players since im lv. 216 on mine and like helping people out, i once dropped 100 stims on a lv. 30 cuz i literally had over 400 of them and needed space 😂
---
Yes^ 
---
One thing I always got hyped over in new DLC was new gear themed around said DLC. 
---
Most of the new faction outfits are all Atom Shop except for the 2 endgame outfits, which are nice. 
---
When we were given atoms from challenges it wou
---
Of course you have the gold bullion items but that + the reputation grind is insane. 
---
Usually you'd get awarded new items through regular progression. I get the DLC is "free" but if you paid for the game I mean...it ain't that free. We definitely need more in game items correlating to whatever DLC is dropping. Encryptid does a great example of this, awarding cool gear from playing it.
---
It's no guarantee. Still probably helps, though.
---
She gave me a mutant slayer's fire rate reload speed minigun. I already have a junkie's with the same two other effects but it was one of the best things I've ever gotten from her
---
Let's call it an even 90.
---
Not sure why you said the math wouldn’t work unless we knew. Which we did. 
---
We knew about the potential for this variable a long time ago. They said in an ITV they’d possibly do this. Then they confirmed it with Fortifying Atlas. 
---
I wasn’t commenting on your main post. It was your reply about ‘the math couldn’t be done’ that I replied to. 
---
The math could be done, with and without the variables. And the event isn’t designed with just you in mind. That’s what makes this amusing to me.
---
I think they fixed that
---
FT didn't have a need to have cap sink in single player games.
---
Thanks. I just picked it up for 10 bucks.
---
Ohhhhh even better.
---
I'm 94 and still haven't launched a nuke. I tend to explore more then do story.
---
It does, My ultrasight Gatling has a faster firing legendary effects so I use charging barrels as it’s like 100 damage I think, Idk if the math equals out that it would do more damage via more hits if it was standard barrels.
---
Why not? "Legacies" are nearly worthless now, every trader has dozens of them on each of their mules and thousands of new ones magically come out every time a new dupe is found. Everybody and their mother has bloodied explosive gatling plasmas nowadays, not many people have the new mask yet
---
I think we're splitting hairs here but I say this because they left a ton of bugs on live that they had fixed for Wastelanders when they were working on it.
---
My point is, this issue will be moot because they're already working on changing it.
---
They can stim the downed players and aggro the wendigo spawns. Them stimming downed players keeps the heavy hitters on target and not repositioning.
---
Any player thats trying to pull their weight, no matter their level is a bonus to me.
---
The level 187 that hid the entire battle  last night with their CSS, didnt fire a shot and didnt stim anyone that went down, thats the real issue.
---
Even a low lvl just using the charisma perk to heal others is doing more, than a high lvl leech.
---
ACP is not meat week, afks arent as welcome.
---
And that, kids, is how I financed my Appalachian empire as far as the eye can see with with single action ivory grip plans.
---
yeah but you'll always be able to get the mask just by playing. you can't get legacies just by playing anymore.
---
If you didn’t know the exact dates and amount of every extra challenge or double score weekend you couldn’t have known which challenges you had to do and didn’t need to do, simple as that.
---
Yes, as we find out about the bonuses we can change the math but it will be different from the start.
---
A great example is how they gave us an extra daily temporarily then decided to keep it permanently. For this reason, any math done previous was up in the air because each day you can get an extra 250 score.
---
I’m not sure why that is so difficult for you to understand.
---
It depends. Do you have a good legendary shotgun to build around?  Is it just shotguns in general?
---
Damn it, do you think so? I want all of them but I don't want to overpay if they're just going to bundle them.
---
Don't forget to kill wendigos, they give you ammo back. I take turns hitting Earle for a minute or so, then wiping the mobs of wendigos, that way you get ammo back and save lives, some ppl don't realise they are getting slapped by Golum until its to late, plus they can carry on firing on Earle if you watch their backs. I'm bloodied and hitting him for 250 per shot in the face, so I can afford to leave him for a moment and wipe the surrounding cretins.
---
Again, so what? You can't get fasnacht masks by playing anymore but they still sell for 50-100 caps each because everybody has dozens of them from afking the event all day. "Legacies" are no different, everybody has dozens of them from duping, bethesda never did anything about the cheaters, they are now common and worthless. Far more supply than there will ever be demand
---
good idea
---
Did this my first time got 360+ screws.
---
I would like the Scrap Box to allow you to scrap your weapons/armor/mods.
---
Well sure missed the gauss pistal part
---
I'm just speaking from experience I was in a server that dropped a nuke on the mine it was me 3 level 100+ but the rest were levels -20 I watched as the other two high levels left the event and so did I.
---
Now we wouldn't have had to missed out on that event had there not been low levels there, that's the reason I stand with the idea of a level floor.
---
fasnacht masks will be back next year. legacies won't.
---
So we can choose whether or not the content of your post is worth checking out.
---
I'm telling you, when I get off the roof and hit her before anyone else does, she flies to me and lands right away.
---
I have a 3* TS and 3* AA shotgun that I use, can’t remember the specific specs but they seem to take down most enemies quite fast
---
Selling cheap things to vendors or public events. The one at Grafton damn is 120
---
Mine is too. It’s a Vampire/25%FFR/15% reload. And I was wondering if the damage equals out or if the standard is better. Against the W. Colossus my standard does 3-4 damage per shot and I’d say maybe 3-4 shots per second (I don’t know for sure). The Charging Barrels does about 8-9 per shot and maybe 1-2 shots a second. 
---
I’ve used the weapon damage calculator but putting on the charging barrels makes the DPS a negative number (-5869)
---
Were you in a private team?
---
It was messing up for me on Xbox. Couldn’t scroll over I closed it down and it was fine then had to restart game
---
Awesome, thanks! That makes a lot of sense then. I don't see the rubberbanding, just damage number are lower than normal. 
---
It seems his health also scales to the number of people in the event, just like the queen. It was much easier and quicker to complete in a private with 3 than in a public with 8.
---
An extra ***500*** SCORE. Not *250*.  They added **TWO** extra dailies, not one. 
---
So, your point is that because of this extra challenge event, you couldn’t have done the math from day one to know exactly how many challenges you needed to do throughout?
---
That’s your complaint?
---
The Charging Barrels are good for regular grinding and farming, not great for boss fights. I use them on an Ultracite Gatling Laser that has Crit rolls. It's ammo efficient and it's satisfying to use. I know conventional wisdom for this game says VATS and heavy weapons don't mix, but after some experimenting this seems to be incorrect.
---
Pfft If I want to bring my level 3 alt down there and die heaps of times while swinging a level 1 baseball bat then that's my business. You should be applauding them for having the balls to do a crazy stunt like that. 
---
I took a level 3 alt down to the queen and died more times than I got hits off. At the end of the event I had two players come up to me, admiring my guts and grit and wanted to fully deck me out with weapons and armor. I told them it was just an alt but thank you for the kind offer. They called me crazy, gave me the heart emote and added me as a friend.
---
I'm on ps4 though
---
Nuclear Winter PvP is garbage and you know it.
---
Also, workshop PvP is a part of the game. Sorry you're so broke that you need workshops for resources.
---
Now its working for me fml
---
No it is not a complaint per say, just mentioning that is how it is. I am surprised it took you almost 10 replies to figure that out lmao
---
PvP is a thing in adventure mode. You're lucky slap damage isn't a thing anymore.
---
It’s in storage
---
Get a vamp explosive combat and you will feel unkillable, add a junk explosive combat for damage.
---
I didn't think of that, with all the multipliers of sneak and aid, that is a big drop in damage.
---
Shotguns in general work like a dream on the wendigos. I use a 2 shot +50 limb damage minigun to burn down Earl and my vampire combat shotgun for spawns. They drop in 2 hits in vats. I make a surplus of about 150-200 shotgun shells each run, it's great.
---
A man is bound to go deaf or crazy in there.
---
Why not both? Don't some spiders eat their males after mating?
---
Are you buying a second copy of the game?
---
It should've been narrated by Samuel L. Jackson. "Lookout Mother f---er! HAHAHAHA!"
---
Tatoos! I want more and better tattoos, for legs, arms, whatever! And long hair! idk why there isn't any long hair, I want my girl have long hair like the me irl lol
---
Not using One Gun Army kind of became habit due to the staggering effect it has on the Queen when she's in the air. Thanks for the reminder though, I legit forgot it even existed. I'll be sure to slap it on next Colossus fight!
---
Yeah I usually don’t have the game closed so when I came home from work I got on to buy new bundle. But it wouldn’t let me look at anything other then the front one. I closed game down and it was fine
---
How do you have the cool blue thing next to ur reddit username. Sorry this was random haha
---
I think slow heavy weapons and VATS are good.
---
I mean, make keyring open a new menu would make it on a different collection and therefore reduce lag but that's asking a lot on a coding standpoint
---
I love stalker with the helmet and skull faceplate / gas mask.
---
Because it's still better than a normal pump and the anti armor effect sometimes it's not even noticeable, the bloodied one does more or equal damage  with me even at 90% health.
---
Taking a workshop=consent to PvP if you stay in the boundaries of said workshop.
---
Beckett will charge halfway across Appalachia to dispatch a firefly, but he'll let a glowing radstag sleep in my bed no problem.
---
I wish it was actually dark at night. But they’ll never do that because people will complain that it’s hard to see
---
Ahh cool, thanks. I didn't really know how it works.
---
I suppose in the end, a good chunk of people on a server are going to join the event. If lower levels stay out of it, it's probably just less people one of the teams will have.
---
8 people allowed per instance
---
Only two wendigos out of the three times I fought earl did I have them drop ammo
---
pc, steam
---
As long as they afk on the drums or the spits, who cares?
---
I'm sure all the people screwed over by greedy players abusing magic weapons would totally find it enjoyable too. Nothing says fun like mowing down a boss in ten seconds and preventing everyone from having a fair boss battle. If you want something broken OP go play modded Fallout 4 and enjoy it where you don't impact others. Magic damage lasted for a long time; it should have been fixed months ago.
---
I am also speaking from experience. This is my third time around. My main is a junkies commando, my second account is 2handed melee, and my current character is the pistol build and I've been around since the beta.
---
The only way you're going to down earle in time is if you have _literally 8 people with highly optimized heavy gun builds or bug abuse and use magic weapons_
---
The boss is doable if you have 4 people with said heavy weapons and the rest clear trash, which I do, but it _still_ takes me 4 fully charged shots to kill one wendigo. Half the times my VATS misses despite it being 95%.
---
But as soon as you take the outfit off, the hair comes back. Outfit says "TODD HOWARD RULES" in neon pink lettering.
---
You don't fail the event because two out of eight players aren't meta. You fail the event when 6 out of eight players have crappy builds and/or  don't know what the hell they are doing.  The OP is saying is all the fault of two players out of eight.  If you have two low levels and the other six have strong builds, there should not be a problem.
---
Does he take damage if he's standing below the collapsing embers?
---
and they're always seen as the bane of the community on all platforms.  Xbox communities however are just a bunch of edgy kids (and adults who never outgrew acting like a child) trying to outgrief each other because of their Neanderthal sense of humor that has them still laughing at fart jokes.
---
my flair?
---
Every circus sideshow bearded lady is grumbling about now.
---
True! I am not complaining about the fact that we're good at it per se; only that it's solved now. It needs a revamp.
---
Look, I agree that the event is bugged, but if you're tired of waiting for her to land there is a way to get her to land quicker. That's all I'm saying.
---
Non meta=crappy
---
No, it took me this many replies (with your associated replies) to get to this;
---
*If an addition to the possible number of SCORE points is a concern to you, why didn’t you make this kind of statement back in July when the two extra daily challenges were added?*
---
And five replies is not ‘almost ten’. ;)
---
I have the opposite problem, there are not enough players joining. I just did one and for the 3 minutes of waiting there where just three of us standing around looking sheepish.
---
They should make it so that everyone participating in an event should be able to loot a legendary enemy, except for bosses like SQ.
---
How would buying with caps or gold be ptw? In the PTS you can buy with gold
---
Water=wet.  I'm not disputing that.  I'm just saying it's a waste of time, ammo, and chems when you could simply ask to join up if you want the recourses or just go and grab some from the unlocked collectors.  Like I said, I got free and easy caps out of it while they got nothing but loss.
---
I’m down. Just that I don’t have a mic or the stuff required for the nuke.
---
It didnt work :(
---
Get it
---
It's so...dare I say.... Fortnite
---
Yeah how i do that
---
It’s meant to be end game, a level 12 could be at a sbq fight.
---
Put down industrial water purifiers at your CAMP if you're on some water, or even at a workshop with some water in a pinch, and you can sell all the water to vendors. Killing animals and cooking their meat and selling it. Plant vegetables and cook that and sell it.
---
Well I think you understood it all wrong,but I can't confirm the pts myself so...whatever.
---
Go to Morgantown airport. Kill scorched. Take all weapons. Sell to train station.
---
Vamp explosive hvy shotguns lasers keeps you at full health, vanguard with solar armor is pretty solid. I ran the vault 94 raids with vanguard poison resist armor and never died.
---
I’ve never really payed attention to vamps but that prefix sounds helpful, sounds pricey too but I’ll have to start saving up my caps lol
---
I have the fancy pump action and it's so good in this event with tier 3 enforcer, plus a 3* anti-armor Gauss shotgun.
---
Plus in VATs you're not expending as much ammo so I've been breaking even at the very least - 3* 4 leaf clover and 3* better criticals. Feels good in this event.
---
Ayyy, I'm level 165ish and I haven't either.
---
I've only been to a handful of Scorchbeast Queen fights, too. Not really my thing.
---
I liked it when it required a little direction, I think it's that we've figured out that you can chamber up the meter by using the spits and drums. If it didn't chamber during the prep period from that, and instead allowed you to chamber using Prime Meat, I'd like it more. I miss being Meat Week Commander.
---
.45 and .50 is where more than half of my caps go, so I guess it's an even trade?
---
Yeah I'm always out of my league despite being 68, so whenever I go in I try to do damage but relegate myself to wendigo duty since at least with them I can usually one shot depending on health/rad level. So that's what I did with this dude (even tho he was able to easily one shot them too lmao, the dude just jumped up and down with marsupial punching away)
---
I bought it less than a month of a 50% sale and I don't regret it.
---
No, public.  No one should have been able to build.
---
Well I mean if you can't beat them join them I understand that you have had that build since
---
 beta, but if it isn't as good as you would want it to be changing it up a bit might be for the best.
---
We are on two different subjects I'm trying to get a level floor for a colossal problem your trying to get a buff to your or a debuff to others weapons lol.
---
I put all the common plans in my vender for 10 caps each. About once a week a noob will come through and clean out a vender and I'll gift them a shielded marine wetsuit.
---
It's the wasteland, not candyland. Do stupid shit, die a stupid death.
---
Agreed, there should be a minimum level to join in. Tho I do wonder, with Wastelanders United where everything scales would there be a point? Granted since this is "endgame" there should be some limit to who can do it, if not at least be a requirement to do it.
---
forrrr ebbbb errr!
---
but the base game used for like 5$ somewhere
---
I would love to see a Wasteland “lich”! That’d be awesome!
---
I personally would say no
---
Nope, should have been out by now but Bethesda is delaying content as they usual do.
---
Then you shouldn’t have placed them. Can’t build on public team.
---
U won’t finish without spending atoms
---
Today was the first day I saw them.  They weren't there yesterday.
---
Well, now that I think of it, I didn't mind the idiots struggling so much. You could direct them! Sometimes.
---
I bought a vamp E double barrel for 15k not too bad
---
Get it! It’s fun. Build the camps. Dress up your allies. Dress yourself up. Shoot the enemies. There’s no shortage of things to do.
---
That's alright we just need the card
---
They removed the items and gave your atoms back?
---
From what I've read and experienced myself, the ammo converter is a bug filled mess. I too have had problems with the converter, but it involves not being able to access the main menu...
---
When I use the machine, I'm given the "What ammo do you want to convert?" part of the menu, and it lists the available ammo types. That is the only part of the menu I've seen and I can't go back or access any other part. I've tried jumping servers and rebuilt the machine, but I get the same thing.
---
I have so many, I use them on the weapons and armor I sell in my vendor, just to get rid of them.
---
Idk if I got one. Let me check real quick.. what’s ur gamertag?
---
Just finished one where he fell through the floor like he was on the express elevator to hell, then he popped back up for a few seconds. Suddenly, he decided to go be with Jesus and raptured up through the ceiling repeatedly. His next trick was hiding in the floor with only one of his heads poked out like a shy turtle. We blasted him and had him almost dead, but then he peaced out for a while, like 5 minutes or so. No wendigo spawns either. We all practiced our emotes while we wondered what was going on. Angry! Confused! Thumbs down! He finally showed up and let us finish killing him. It was a wild ride. Kudos, Beth. Always keeping us guessing.
---
It was available last week? Shit. How did I miss that?
---
Hey reily, imma fan of ur little crew😂 nice vids btw
---
Maybe also considering a different melee weapon.  IIRC, that mole miner gauntlet is heavy.
---
I guess it's going to be on the last couple of weeks of their game calendar  lol
---
Not sure about him, but I think the ads do. I watched one get melted. It is possible the damage was just catching up from the lag though. 🤷‍♂️
---
I'm EncryptHeart579
---
Maybe except for the Scorchbeast Queen. She already never lands, trying to melee her on a non-melee build would be an incredible pain.
---
Yep, still hoarding those atoms.
---
The thing a lot of people complained made it un-fun was the region restriction, the locked level of the mole miners only dropping lower-leveled legendaries, the *extremely* low chances of getting the better pails and the unique rewards, and the nigh-identical loot pool to the holiday scorched event. Changing all of those things for the better will probably make it way more fun to hunt across the Wasteland for them. :) Sure, it'll play the same, but a lot of the 'fun' comes from hunting them down and getting the little dopamine jolt from seeing an ornate pail, rare plan, or a potentially worthwhile legendary pop up.
---
Good to hear Bethesda listened to the criticism of the last one!
---
Bad Friends..
---
i know im alone but i prefered the treasure event when it was harder to get the rare loots...
---
And youre basing your level floor on getting very lucky with weapons lol.
---
Any level past 50 is greatly useless because it doesn't effect how good your gear is past that point.
---
I can GREATLY optimize how quickly I level by stacking intellegence and uses lunchboxes, I can be level 200 in a few hours provided I keep running whitesprings and burrows.
---
That follows the lore of the BoS hording information, great idea!
---
Can I try to take your workshop instead? I won't dissapoint. Ign Nekrosias
---
I just gave a hundred or so to a level 30. Even he left plenty in the dirt, don't blame him. It's annoying as the cap value of those would have been close to 50k by what's written on them but of course since the robo vendors don't want they are gone. Nice to get some stash weight back anyway!
---
I only heard about it a couple months ago myself. Lol
---
I completely agree, however, I would also add that mutating should make the creature's hair become blond and spiky!
---
(The power level is over 9000!)
---
Thanks dude. :)
---
I mean if we stop to think, the loading screen has bugs, the events mostly all have bugs... random assortment of buggy items at any given time/patch... Broken atom shop items, items that clip, float, don't display or don't work at all, the Legendary Run bugs for many people. Map icons can bug and not display, captured workshops can bug and you still have to pay to fast travel to them, groups can bug and not properly display who is in the group and required a rejoin or restart... friends can randomly be removed, gear can randomly be unequipped and shit you didn't put up for sale can randomly be bought for 1 cap . . .etc, etc...
---
Basically every damn aspect of the game has been, and likely WILL remain bugged. If they patched it out, don't worry, it'll be back. XD
---
Had a level 23 sit in the back without a weapons out. He even t-bagged players that died
---
Yeah I think charging barrels are bugged on the weapon damage calculator. It says -5889 DPS and against W. Colossus it says it does -500 damage a second to him.
---
I'm just glad it's over!!! FREEDOM!!!
---
I don't know. 250 is a good price though, I grabbed it up.
---
Right? I’ve got a Bloody Swing Speed just waiting for its hour to come round at last.
---
You on xbox, ps4 or pc? On Xbox it’s on game pass which is $8 a month to try it. I think pc might allow you to use game pass to play it also? Someone who plays on pc or has tried might have to correct me if I’m wrong on that.
---
If you have an Xbox, it’s “free” on Xbox games pass, I’ve been playing via that. Not sure if it’s on the PC games pass yet.
---
Whaaaa? They haven't been dropping me any and I light them up for the screws.... oh the glorious screws
---
Yep, it was probably a knife that does bleed damage, so the player couldn't FT because of ongoing health damage. Sneaky sneaky.
---
I’m on Xbox ☺️
---
black titanium shotgun slugs
---
+100 range
---
+25 base damage 
---
extra durability loss
---
Yeah that's good point, The level floor is so the people that join at least have a decent build going, good or bad as long as it works, I was level 137 before I even knew builds were a thing
---
🤭
---
I got 2 cards I can give you if needed
---
Dude the f'ing legendary run board that you can display sinks into my walls every time i load up lol. The Resin roofing they sold a few weeks back, i just noticed is clipping through my f'ing walls upstairs... the bunker items all float... etc, etc, and now this shit XD
---
I can craft you some good standard armor and weapons to help you out a bit later this evening if that would be helpful. 
---
IGN: secalane
---
It's so cheap now, I workshop hesitant, you wont be out much if you end up not liking it
---
We have ran the event that many times since it dropped that it probably wouldn't be healthy. Our frame rate has only dropped once and that was when some bright spark pulled their telsa out, event turned to shit and we failed. We have also had Earl glitch out twice and get stuck in the roof and ground for half of the event.
---
Sorry that happened bro, guys sounded like a jerk.
---
That sounds amazing. how much? And do you want to tag along?
---
Glitches are so OP :(
---
Not even Bethesda knows how to nerf them...
---
Ok but you need to complete the new event before soneone completes the queen then? Seems quite hard to do.
---
You are not alone. No mutations, no addictions, no builds,  not bloodied... 
---
Doing just fine.
---
Sad thing is the one im looking forward to is perk loadouts since the first month of the game's release and that IS in the last weeks. Seeing the first item in the roadmap not even available yet means ill be able to use loadouts by the end of spring next year.
---
I would just be glad if they removed mr. Handy buzz blades and mole miner gauntlet plans. Like wtf.
---
They have weight to them eventually people would just start dropping them
---
Ghost camp budget. RIP.
---
Oh yeah :) im glad they gave us a free one
---
To be fair, he is very easy to shoot at.
---
I just carry multiple launchers, apparently even the m79 benefits from the heavy wep weight reduction perk card. Nothing says you want to watch the world burn more than carrying around a small armies worth of grenade/missile/mininuke launchers in your back pocket.
---
Hopefully someone will see your post &amp; have the information we seek, Vampire effects are great.
---
I don’t need anything for them just the nuke launch GT is BigBangTheory73 I’m showing offline idk if that messes up invites
---
Totally, I'm lucky i got a ps gift card weeks ago and i don't like 90% of the things in the shop lately so I'm good in atoms rn, so I log in and do whatever i want, i did the colossus twice, i got the plushie so I'm not wasting more bullets, all free and relaxing lol
---
Probably the same way I missed the wooden modern sculpture whenever it was offered ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Paradox! Paradox, I say! How can both exist at the same time?!?
---
Those thrones must contain paradox-absorbing crumple zones!
---
as much as I'd love to go up against someone who most likely has more experience and more legendary gear considering as i said I just hit 50, I'll stick to the actual pvp mode if I want to pvp instead if fighting some edgy wannabe "raiders"
---
Me toooooooooo
---
Yeah only way I don’t go down against the Colossus and his minions
---
You can run nuke silo in 3 mins lol
---
I am _not touching it_ if they haven't really updated the lot loot pool.
---
Subreddit user flair option
---
mothman egg omelets yo..
---
Yeah 60-70 so you can iron out your build and use all the gear.
---
Sounds good just join my game and after the nuke launch we can kill the new boss
---
Been months now
---
I always stock .50 when I have it, but it goes fast.
---
Sounds good
---
I died during it last night with about 5 minutes to go and got a 62 second respawn countdown, maybe that?
---
considering that's what we got prior to the Legendary Run that would be nice, give those who have completed it/about to a reason to log on every day again.
---
I do! But doesn't seem like he takes damage from anything at all! 😁
---
I very rarely use buffs, I collect chems to sell and the bobbleheads and magazines are just piling up in my stash. Weapons, though, I love having a Vampire lever rifle, a Vampire combat rifle, a Vampire shishkebab, a Vampire Gauss Pistol, a Vampire Gauss minigun, and a Vampire gatling laser. I also have 2 stalker weapons, a minigun and a gauss shotgun. I also have a two shot gauss shotgun and a suppressor's light machine gun and flamer.
---
*Internet explorer gave an updoot*
---
The answer is literally in the description of the perk card
---
I’ve worn the same outfit since finding it a few days after launch. I’ll never find something better then my pastor robes and old fishing hat.
---
No it hasn’t. It’s been less than a month since that change was made
---
I forgot about my mutations, Marsupial, healing factor, and energized. I also have serum's for grounded and plague walker. I just haven't figured out if grounded would counteract energized.
---
If you enjoyed the other Fallouts  then you’ll enjoy this. Better with friends but completely playable alone. Scavenge, build, survive. It’s Fallout. Great community in general.  Do it.
---
&gt;Make sure to loot the wendigos as some of them will carry your ammo type including ultracite rounds.
---
*cries in 40mm*
---
at least they're adding 40mm to that new ammo system in the pts
---
Today I barely did a colossal problem with a level 615, 196, 141 (me), then 86, 69, 77 and two others I can’t remember
---
I bought the last three levels last night because i got those atoms back with level 100.
---
Glad it's over. Also glad the Wendigo Colossus is live now, otherwise i'd really have nothing worth doing.
---
Ooo he called me edgy. Give him your reddibucks. If you want I can face ya on a lowbie. Or on a character leveled to you. Doesn't really matter to me my dude :P the endgame is all PvP. I have nothing better to do in fallout.
---
And birds live in it. Or a bee's nest.
---
I'm almost level 400, you expect me to "carry" level 90s who "might" not have a solid build or gear! Make it instanced per person. I dOn'T wAnNa CaRrY aNyOnE...
---
Only real challenge is the falling burning amber. Does add to the fun tho.
---
It would be used more as a griefing tool
---
It depends on what it is. If it’s the secret service or t65 (gold bought plans) then no. Otherwise yes
---
Xbox game pass players maybe? (Ik it’s also on PC but prob more on console idk)
---
In cod i dont remember wich one you can nuke
---
Exactly!
---
Could be coincidence but the two Colossal Problem I went yesterday dropped much better items than I usually get from the Queen event. Two nice weapons, both two shot, 3 stars. And tons of screws (feels as good as a legendary item)
---
Join the club. I haven't been able to access my private server since Wastelanders and the last I heard about it was that customer service was going to send it to their tech team to figure out...that was 4 months ago. But they will happily continue to take my money every month.
---
Is the Grelok cackle not a laugh?
---
Also a heads up, you are going to need quite a bit of concrete to build brick walls, so start collecting
---
Even though I feel the same way, I wish people would stop not logging after they completed the run. It's just going to show that Bethesda made the right decision to put in the dailies to gain player retention.
---
It’s 9.99 on xb1 at gamestop (:
---
Yes. You aren't wandering alone.
---
Oh definitely, and we should ideally get 1 more than SBQ too because of how much of an ammo dump the event is. I had about 17 the other day and since then the event alone has dropped that number down to 6
---
It’s really fun just exploring the wasteland online discovering crazy creatures and weapons I’d say yes
---
Similar experience on PC.  Rare that we get 8.  It’s usually maybe 5 and I’m always hoping they are over 200 so they’ve got a better chance at meaningfully helping.
---
I’d welcome some lowers to fill the slots.  Maybe they can help with the never ending level 75 screw dropping Wendy’s.
---
Lmao! That’s so funny cause really you prob f*^# that player over with his weight, esp if he was new and still weight managing lol
---
Yep, I had a similar experience last night well at the cookout, they kept throwing nuka grenades at us well on the spit,  I had passafied mode on, to quickly removing it and chasing this donkey dick around the server until he finally left the server. What a shame, you can dish it out, but can't take what you served. I remember your profile name, so let's hope you don't end up on my server again, because paybacks are my specialty. Be thankful we didn't meet in person 🙏 
---
Just ignorant, I get it it's just a game, but common now this is a community event, in which everyone is working together for some fun.
---
More people still pvp than you think man. This is not a single player game. There’s teams ffs.
---
Man, I was in one earlier and no joke 6 of the guys ranged from 27-58. It was brutal. I died more times in that one than the 10 other times I've done it total. Must have had 30 wendigos on my tail trying to take down Earle. We managed to get it with one minute to spare
---
Agreed there. Could care less if someone goes afk on meet week, especially if they are playing the music or turning the spits. But I did my 5th and 6th Colossal Problem today. We failed the 5th, and not from low level players. There were 3 who died and just stayed up top hiding. Only noticed because I died and had to go past them.
---
I’m a heavy junkie critical build lol, I rely on vats a lot so I may as well use the critical hits lol
---
Why not ask them to write an AI to play the game for you ?
---
Of course it does!
---
Pvp does nothing to help you with the game, does it finish quests for you,  does it help you with the Brotherhood, does it help you with the Overseers quest line. No, so its non essential for game play, it non essential for gathering resources,  ammo, chems.  It's just a way to show how much of an asshole you really are that's all it does,  nothing else. There are no proven benefits from PVP whatsoever.  All PVP does is prevent  non pvpers from enjoying the game that's all. And slap damage was a dick move anyway, that losers and the scum of the earth used.
---
Thank you all of y’all. I just started installing it. Any advice? I’m considering a medic build.
---
Trade for plan?
---
Dial up’s a B bois.Either way I feel like it should be 7600. So much time...
---
Why do people need to glitch at all.  Silo takes 10-15min to run once u learn the route.
---
If you ignore them, you keep 50% of the perk
---
Candles and wall scions are good options
---
There are still some outfits that NPCs are wearing that I don't think are obtainable in the game. Particularly one I want has the stop sign on the arm.
---
Same.  That is big dick Bethesda fucking us.  This is a real case where we shouldn’t get screwed but do.
---
For the few events I've done I've avoided deaths by staying in the center and circling around Earl and using cover. Just keep moving and dont get complacent like the Queen and stand still shooting. You have to juke and jive.. Also, every few "rounds" i kill the wendingo spawns while the other work on him and then back to shooting.
---
Gotta keep a very good eye on your health bar too. Just stock up on stimpacks and spam them. Spawns drop them along with ammo.
---
But also yes it the death penalty sucks in ACP. I die often too while attempting to use the strategy above. Just keep moving,  use cover and spam stimpacks
---
If you want to AFK meat week and the drums / spits are taken, just server hop...
---
I have a theater across from the mansion... will find pics
---
Solution: more cryptid events? Nuke Grafton to get a Super Grafton Monster!
---
Go through your inventory and sell any chems you don't absolutely need.
---
Move camp and start over my man.
---
Lmao. This is gold.
---
Awesome suggestion.
---
If you have a medic, yeet yourself down the shaft and let him revive you to proc revenant. Use psychotats to increase damage. Throe a tank into earles face so that he gets distracted and go at it!
---
Pc and have done it plenty of times with low lvls.   Havnt failed an event yet or remember anyone complaining.  Shit I laugh when I see low lvls.   
---
This has to be a console thing.
---
Can't it be done solo? (Been a while, haven't joined this one). So someone else going afk has no effect on anyone else other than they see someone getting free stuff?
---
I tend to ignore them and enjoy the event myself. Makes it better for me than trying to ruin someone else's effort (or non-efforts).
---
In events where you actually need everyone, ya, I agree, don't afk.... But this one doesn't. Same with fashnact. Don't need everyone so messing with afkers is just wasting you're own time.
---
Shouldn't probably state I don't afk event, but I also don't pay the afkers any attention.
---
I've seen one nuke since the update...
---
This has been my assumption as well. I figure they can travel underground from all over using the mine network.
---
You do realize with this specific event the AfK people actually help especially in the 1st 2 minute warm up. If you have three people on the drums you start out at almost 75 percent complete. Almost ensuring a good 100 percent outcome. Not that AFK is great in all situations but this one is can be a huge benefit to the successful 100 percent completion of the event. Just food for thought.
---
Even higher level players can be useless. Just earlier some dude was creeping around with a single shot Fixer... Against an end game boss. Sometimes you've just gotta carry folk 🙄.
---
The plushie.......until it gre up 🤔
---
Shoot for the legs and cripple the creature it is then forced to stay in one spot. This is just one small piece of information to add to your list of things that will help you.
---
Full health goes well with some vanguard. Be aware when the Brotherhood update comes there will be new stuff to purchase with gold: weapons, armor, etc.
---
I specifically asked for clarification in this post just to rule out any misunderstanding of the very thing you are saying I am misunderstanding. Hell, that's the entire point of this post and why its marked as a question. Is that unclear? Like really now.
---
I cant get on the PTS either to confirm.
---
The only person to respond with an actual response confirmed that's how it behaved, go get all huffy with them maybe?
---
It’s the source of some of them.   I’ve heard ACP has framerate issues on its own, but tesla rifles def do it.
---
I know you could probably kill him with nothing more than a level 15 armed to the teeth with grenades.
---
I enjoyed chasing the guys down and killing them, but the rewards were mostly garbage and the drop rates abysmal.
---
Probably shortly after the next XP exploit is discovered.
---
Lol classic Bethesda. Imagine not having easily scalable cosmetics that you can pump out week after week without worrying about breaking the fucking game in one way or another.
---
How do these things keep slipping past their QA? It’s completely unacceptable.
---
Where the nuke comes out, I think?
---
That is one of the missile silo tops, a nuke comes out from there if you launch one
---
Pretty sure that’s where nukes come out.
---
I've had 1500  .50 rounds in the machine for over a week.
---
Dude wasnt on drums or spit. He was being a bush wookie.
---
Idk why but I really like the way the leather armor from new Vegas looks. Somebody made a mod for fallout 4 that remade it and it looked so good, would be nice to have something similar
---
Lady Wendy is her name......and you show her respect lol
---
nice! I really don't know why I subjected myself to the grind, but I am a longtime fallout fan and while I didn't want to try 76 when it came out, I wanted to eventually. Plus I really haven't tried any 'season pass' before and let me tell yah, there are much better ways of holding paying customers attention ..nonetheless this one is easy
---
That I get completely.  Just like the guys hiding in tents in the sky.....lol. zero help with the event I get.....
---
I was on the fence about the game until this year.  I really enjoy the fallout series but was skeptical about it being multiplayer since I am mostly a single player gamer and would have difficulty adapting.  After reading extensively about the game, a lot of people said it could be played single player so I bought it for about 9 dollars.  I even purchased fallout 1st to ensure I could maintain the single player experience via private world.  Now, I rarely if ever use my private world.  I enjoy the player interactions and the overall FO76 community.  It’s probably the best video game investment I have made in quite a while.  They are always adding new content too, so really there’s nothing to lose.  I would grab a copy and try it out.
---
A. Like I said people have said vanguards isn’t worth it with full health because as soon as you start getting shot it’s effects diminish a lot, so bolstering could be better for full health. And no, new bullion stuff isn’t confirmed so stop going around spreading lies.
---
Did you even read the post?
---
You can see them fail basic UV mapping on things like the Blood Eagle suppressor.
---
Seems they only assign the bottom of the barrel to this game for the most part.
---
You are missing my point. I'm not talking about super-rewards, I'm talking about something that helps them out like a couple stimpaks &amp; some water. Jeez, calm down.
---
I would really like to see tactical armour. Outfits with armour plating and/or ammo belts.
---
On the other hand, the Spike raider armour from Fallout 4 is really nice. I would like to have the helmet and outfit as two separate pieces of clothing.
---
I've read on here that this has been happening here and there sometimes he's stuck in the floor sometimes he's stuck in his ceiling with his little legs hanging out. Cripple his legs so he can't move.
---
still worth! Knowing that we also got atoms through the run itself. Still not as many as what was offered before which is a shame/sham hah I started just before they switched the systems
---
Only option sadly
---
thanks! Congrats to you too!
---
i see what you’re saying but i think that the idea is a trade off. this you get lot treasury notes but the queen you get some repair kits.
---
Is there some kind of reference for INT not being effective in helping you actually learn the mods as well?
---
hah twitching intensifies as we grow near the end I'm sure. Keep on it! Hopefully the double score helped!
---
Wouldn't focus on a medic build, not super viable damage wise.
---
What they really need to do is make it so everyone can come into the instance and not 8 people at a time. During scorched earth I love seeing low level players try and help. But the feeling is exactly the opposite during Colossal Problem. It just nags me in the back of my head "that spot could be taken up by someone useful". They shouldn't make a lvl cap they should make it so everyone is in the same instance.
---
xD
---
For meeting the requirements to craft certain items and/or reduce the crafting cost of standard energy weapons.
---
lol right? No real notification or anything
---
Try a different sub. This one doesn’t allow bartering posts.
---
10000% same here!!
---
Everybody should stop buying their atomic crap. Quality control is complete garbage at Bethesda. 
---
Every week I just look forward to people saying which items are messed up. I'll continue to save my atoms.
---
Sweet, thanks! 👌🏻
---
I like the leather armor in this too especially with nice underarmor but most of us don't use leather armor anymore
---
Best of luck.
---
I don't really mind The pipboy as it's kinda part of every fallout game but they could just make it optional!!
---
no way I just passed that today and placed my tent next to it so I could explore it later, I had no idea what it was either LMAO
---
What's does SBQ stand for? Slain a bitch quick? 🤔
---
Where tf is Bethesda? I haven't seen a single post these last few weeks regarding bugs with Bethesda's CMs replying or doing the typical "we'll pass it to the team"...
---
I was in the event and two people had explosive miniguns, my laptop stood no chance
---
Aqua Boy/Girl might keep them alive. 
---
But if you’re going to AFK, do it on the drums or spits. At least contribute and don’t just be a leech.
---
I don’t think levels really matter tbh. There’s a lot of “noobs in learning” out there. 
---
My very first event I was a tad late and was paired with only one lv68 dude. He was in power armour, and get this, only using a bloody chainsaw!
---
I pretty much solo the event once I figured out the area. Seriously tho, dude was using a chainsaw 🤣!!
---
Lol PC version servers are dead for ACP..was busy for like ..two days then nothing
---
Probably not the same one, there’s 3 of them
---
I mean, there will be additional things to use gold bullion for, but I haven’t seen anything about additional weapons/armor. 
---
It’s a reasonable assumption, but I don’t think it’s been stated by Bethesda.
---
legacy weapon huh? i paid 542 caps for it. so, did i get a good deal on it?
---
Becketts bar... best spot iv'e found, oh and the raider in a cage tree, can hang several and it looks dope.
---
Nah, I only recently started playing, picked it up during the last steam sale. Was a blast levelling and pushing through the missions. Didn’t give any thought to rare apparel or loot, just anything that could help me develop my build and strength. Was really satisfying. Now after having one character at 260 and building a new tank character to 160 am I starting to scope out what’s rare, what’s valuable and focusing on trading. I guess my point is when you start this game there’s a lot of fun just focusing on, well the game haha. My feeling is it’s only once you are over the mission hurdles then the rarity game begins.
---
Don't feel bad I am a level 480, and even I got my ass handed to me to be saved by a level 40 player and we did get that ugly bitch down, barely.
---
 I apologize for you not completing the event, but sometimes it just the Way it goes.  With out sounding disrespectful. Actually I died trying to find my way out. 
---
In addition to  this I can't count how many times I have had lower level players at SBQ event and had it fail, I just shrug it off and  move on, it's a sport, sometimes you win, and sometimes you lose.
---
 I think that everyone has the right to be able to at least try it. I get the work that goes into making it happen can be time consuming for some, and yes it disappointing not to win, but it also gives the lowest level players something to dwell on that higher level player gave me a chance to play with them.  It's kind of like being the big brother. 
---
I hope your luck turns around and you nail that dirty Debbie  in the ass, on your next round. Ugly bitch of a thing. 🤢
---
I wish you, and everyone all the best. 😀
---
They need them in case they find any more tentacle monsters!
---
Tell me about it. After all. How can Bethesda prove anyone did it legitimately and not illegally? 
---
Some people play this game 10+ hours a day and I am sure could legit finish the run in 2 weeks or less....others cheat. 
---
Until they fix all the bugs, get rid of every single duped item, and anything else that is wrong with the game, I don’t think anyone deserves anything once they finish. You received your gifts, and now it’s time to sit back, relax, and enjoy Appalachia.
---
So no word on the automatic Teslas causing large framerate drops and pixellation on consoles?
---
IIRC the new pails are technically different items and therefore won't change any of the drop table of the old ones.
---
Same thing happened to me with just one mirror ball in my RR. Sucks but I'm not demolishing it and all my vendors to get one lamp. There's really no way to get it once the ceiling swallows it up.
---
You didn’t even read his post
---
That seems a foreign concept for the players of this game.
---
wait, really? wtf aaaaaahhh
---
Still waiting for that jukebox (hope it plays the surfer music you can play inside the crater.
---
i'm the one using a shotgun, the clip is of me I was doing next to no damage as most people do, it was the lvl 400 with the minigun that melted the boss.
---
Some of my thoughts. PA is good for spamming stims. Adrenaline maxed, so I’d boost it up with the wendigos then go at Earl. I’m a heavy guns build. So I used SH armor, B LD LMG. ATe him up pretty fast.
---
Visit the Mothman Giftshop sometime. Out by Haven Church, we'll be glad ta have ya!
---
How is this an exploit?
---
Just give me a fucking god damn SEARCH bar for our inventory, fucking Christ.
---
Cool.  So ACP + Tesla is a combination for super fail, awesome.
---
reinstall the game
---
I put mine in the "have a nice day" slockum joes thing it fits almost perfectly.
---
Other people are saying the only option is to move your camp, DONT listen to them. Build a generator, then a flamer trap aiming directly into the wall of the garage. Attach it with a wire and it will destroy your garage (not fully, but to where you have to repair it) the roof should be gone and now you can remove the mirror balls then repair the garage
---
Not the only option
---
How about we get the option to re-enter if we die near the end so we can collect our rewards?
---
Low levels joining is a problem but, people against top builds because they don't want to conform are too. I am constantly seeing people complain about only being able to play junky or bloody. I've never played an mmo that didn't require optimized builds for end game content. I just killed him with 3 of us and the other 2 were under 100 and constantly dying. If 1 or 2 people have a real build it's not hard at all. Heavy junky PA makes Earle a joke.
---
A reasonable request? Nah can’t have that. 
---
-Beth, 2020
---
Probably
---
Why are you telling him to do this when there’s other ways to do it without ruining all of his work on his camp?
---
Lowbies: Stop one shotting bosses!
---
Also lowbies:  I CANT DO SHIT! HELP!
---
The trick is to get the pointer as close to the middle as possible, then it appears in front
---
Depends on what you like about the Fallout games!
---
Do you like exploring? Do you like finding the little microstories Bethesda puts around their map? Do you enjoy the looting and crafting (or hoarding) cycle that comes from the new junk system from 4? Are you the sort of person that enjoys a grind for rare loot and gets a nice dopamine bump from finding something cool? Did you like building settlements in Fallout 4? Does the idea of playing with others in the Fallout universe interest you? Does the Appalachian atmosphere appeal to you? Then yes, certainly!
---
If what you like about the Fallout games is *primarily* the writing, quests, and NPCs, then I'd give it a pass or at least wait until it's 50% off or so. There's some clever writing and good quests and characters in here, but there's a *lot* of chaff as well. While the Wastelanders update added in a bunch of human NPCs and additional questlines, they're serviceable but *hardly* the best the series has to offer.
---
EDIT: I typed all this up and then saw you already bought it. Alas.
---
Have you read the descriptions of the perk cards? Nowhere does it say it reduces crafting cost
---
Literally was thinking this samething earlier when I had four lvl 15-25 in there with me and nobody was doing damage
---
Yes imagine doing incredibly easy daily and weekly challenges for easy atoms, I think the most I grinded for the 3000 cap it took me 2 weeks
---
thats pretty much where my caps go.. spent on .50
---
Yes I did?
---
Because when you walk through the curtains it slows you down, stops you for a second. So if the curtains weren't there you would just take some damage and be pushed forward. But because you move slowly it like hits you a ridiculous amount of times and you just die. 
---
And if I want to be picky clipping things through walls so they are invisible is also a little shady. But it's more the other thing.
---
They aren’t hurting you or the other people, what’s the issue here? It sounds like you guys were just being dicks for no reason
---
What if you are not on a team, but in A Colossal Problem? Does that count as a team?
---
If you read it you would’ve just told him what he was asking, not give him a useless piece of information
---
I was that lv 20 just tryna get some good loot to sell😅🙏
---
I run a non vats full health commando build
---
[my current build, still fine tuning it](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=8f66876&amp;d=sb2s01s61sv0pg2ph2pp2pi2po2eo2eh2ck0cr0cu2i12i92ii0ik0ar2an2ao0&amp;w=lt2li2a72a42&amp;am=1f-1c-1e-1g-1d&amp;wp=w6&amp;wm=1127)
---
He wasnt even wrong
---
got pushed to patch 22.  September.  Probablyneill get pushed again
---
Go to the weapons workbench and hover over it, it should say _/_ mods learned. The left is how many you know the right is the total number. Idk where to get them but that should show you how many available mods there are
---
I was able to place it in the connection of 2 walls (between 2 windows) and in a single wall i used the painting tip i read here, it looks nice, like the game board is framed
---
I believe you speak to Maggie who is at foundation and that will let you start the quest
---
That is fallout 76 slapstick right there.
---
The harpoon gun is worth 40 scrip, so is the shovel. You could probably sell the Pickaxe for a bit though
---
Lol. No you didn’t overpay. And just to be clear, my last couple of sentences about “... taking the legacy burden off your hands...” were supposed to be humorous and not at all to be taken seriously.
---
Pretty sure the pts has a mole miner underground system location so maybe in the future we can genocide them underground too
---
Aye. It's all good. You may want a couple of turrets though. 
---
is it near the water and junk pile? or the waterfall?
---
My magic bloodied minigun melts.
---
Cool, thanks!
---
I saw someone use a power fist on him and he was doing a good amount of damage. I messaged him afterwards and sent me a picture of his bloodied power fist with 3k damage.
---
Awesome thanks
---
The commie jetpack is the only one. I made one for all 5 characters. It's quite nice. Get it while the bug works.
---
For the record you must have the t60 jetpack learned for it to work.
---
What are your secondary effects on the mini you use?
---
I think you buy the mods from a vendor, the robot in Harper’s ferry I think?
---
No worries!
---
Is that the order which you take the buffs?
---
I think that’s great btw.  I only partially agree with the nerfing stuff.  I think if someone takes the time to farm all the buffs they should end up with some serious power well above someone who doesn’t.
---
Just did it on console and had two idiots lv34 and lv47 taking up spots thank good we had a level 500+ and me at lv 200 with the others being above lv80 because I was doing serious damage and I was still dying being a glass cannon bloodied build I was getting focused by earl and the lv 500+ had to be a full health tank or junkies because he tanked but anytime I would get in good damage forget it lol I be focused by the mob but seriously if you under lv80 don’t bother cause you just a liability.
---
I believe that I didn't give him a useless piece of information. I told him max out his build buddy. Which he obviously needs to do.
---
I ain’t mad. Id be doing the same thing.  Lol
---
thats what i thoight.. i just hear about legacy weapons goin for 10s of thousands of caps.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Armor\_Ace\_(season)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_Ace_(season))
---
Also got me to 50 hella fast so that I can be useful, so I appreciate guys like you !
---
Bashing and 25% less AP
---
Congratulations on you completing the  game! 😀
---
 I am confused, you managed to complete the 7600hrs, I am at 3800hrs hours now, and I have completed 99% of the Game except that one just curious how many hours you played a day. 
---
Nonetheless I do wish you all the best 👍
---
Well crap....any good locations by a water source?
---
I guess no pc?
---
So, on the Aug 25th ATX update post on the fallout site, they have a picture with [unobtainable Responder stuff](https://imgur.com/a/i5LanGV).  I WANT THESE THINGS!!!
---
It's used for a few syringer receivers, too, so, you know, super useful.
---
U can do that until it resets
---
It’s near a water source
---
And what type of turrets do u recommend
---
Another nice thing about playing bloodied - you only need diluted stims/radaway/rad-x. The regular versions are just free caps.
---
Considering there are bugs regarding lifetime challenges since release, i doubt they will pull another hotfix for this season, not to mention, their last hotfix for the autocomplete was a complete joke and it broke atoms.
---
I got maybe 10 of them, because I like using government requisition holotapes and doing Collision course. They drop. They really drop. 
---
Stopped scrapping them as soon as I found out they were rare. Have the indigo and pink nowadays. Level 25 and 35 I think.
---
High-Level Players only? Hmmm? This event is off-limits unless you played since Beta. That's the way to create a game!
---
Low Levels can participate. They can experience it and take really cool photos. Bethesda should have never made it an 8 person limit and stuck it in a space-limited cave. It should have been created just like SBQ. Hell in the promo videos the damn thing was just walking down the street.
---
Thank you kindly, but that doesn't list the rewards for each stage yet, which is what I was after. I suppose I'll keep an eye on it and see if it gets updated, though. :)
---
That’s where nukes launch from. Pretty cool if you happen to be there when it happens
---
I use an Instigating Guass Shotgun. One shot everything except Scorched Beast/Queen. Also us an AA pump action. One to 2 shot everything. Use Concentrated Fire lvl 3 perk. Plus Grim reaper Sprint. It's VATS
---
Yeah, I'm gonna get a digital copy
---
Considering all the other shit you can buy in the game there was already a cap sink without having to nerf fast traveling into shit
---
wont that delete all my photos
---
Same issue. Took literally 2 restarts. 10 server hops. T fuse first and then it went through.
---
I’ve got a fairly good concept of which ones are rare, but there are a few that just have me clueless. For example the small letter plan, I have played the game for over 650hrs and I’ve found that plan twice(I bought mine from a vendor) but both times were in the last two weeks, I never once found it in the 19months prior. So is that plan rare or am I unlucky.
---
Imagine that, you never leave the forest, you keep getting levels, your weapon is less effective as you level up because the same enemy in the same spot will keep getting level as you do.
---
I always have it on. Fire hurts, but the scream is irrelevant.
---
Its occurred quite a few times for me. The regular tesla seems to be ok, but an automatic reduced fps like crazy and makes pixelated shadows/ textures
---
Nuke hatch thingy
---
if you can put down level 2s then use level 2s =0
---
Why? Were hey hurting anyone?
---
Which could be said of any of the emotes.
---
Submit a support ticket and they will refund you.
