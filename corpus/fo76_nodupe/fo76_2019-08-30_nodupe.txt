The m√ñth need l√Ñmp. I wanna m√ñth

I do have something of a tic about this. If I suddenly hear a player come behind me waiting, I almost always back out and let them go ahead. 
---

---
I like to carefully take my time perusing the inventory, sometimes for like 10 min, prioritizing what I need etc. Can't do that when you know someone is right over your shoulder, probably just waiting to dump junk for daily caps ü§∑
---
Oh I forgot about the tadpole swimming badge. Weird that they turned the boat rental into a private interior
---
Yeah I was gonna say....Please try emulating the format of posts on the marketplace sub to get yours to work there.
---
I believe that its the patch after that the vaults will be introduced
---
Shit. I thought it was a global reset on a 24 hr timer. I feel dumb now. Another idea would be to kick the limit to 1k. It's not gonna kill the market. Players have a lot of trash to get rid of.
---
Gotcha
---
Nope. Unlike in fallout 4, no damage boosting capacitors except prime exist for laser rifles, which is a shame
---
I'd take Danes synth meat anyday
---
Just let us wear our full armor and set armor weight to zero so we don't over encumber. I dont care if they suppress armor perks to prevent double dipping. Switching from low weight builds to PA builds shouldnt be this counterintuitive.
---
all i know it there is 1300 plans.

Wouldn't a Ghoul be immune to radiation damage also?

i feel like that should be thing already, including the triangle.

Ummm....

Maybe add a mutation for that haha

yessssss. even if it looked like the old yahoo pool.

You'd unlock the 7600 hours achievement before you'd get that.

Yes this site just pulls your vid captures straight from xbox live it's what I use to share clips

you're welcome  :)
---
Wouldn't you get red balls, from rust?
---
well, but that grip plan is very hard to find
---
/s
---
Cool concept! Where‚Äôd you come up with that one?
---
Probably because they don't expect people to use it, I have one and want mods for it though
---
The plan can be found at trainstation vendors. Try watoga, lewisburg and pleasant valley.
---
Make levers and scrap them untill you learn your mods.
---
The new colossal problem even is great for screws.
---
If youre on PS4 i can mod it for you.
---
Could have like "be immune to radiation but  can't come into contact with salt as it would burn like fuck"  haha
---
Kidding, more like "be immune to radiation but lose -100 energy and damage resistance"
---
Damn, so next week's weeklies are the last weeklies
---
Yep. If it‚Äôs the same caliber, automatic is always going to be more rounds down range and thus more damage. Semi is really only good for using less resources.
---
If you want boss-level damage on a slow-firing gun, you need to up the caliber to a point that making an automatic variant isn‚Äôt feasible (‚Äòrecoil‚Äô is so great that you need to pause after a shot just to realign)
---
If you want same caliber semi to do as much damage as it‚Äôs automatic counterpart, you need some kind of magic macguffin like VATS and Crit.
---
Or just deal with the dissonance that this same bullet fired from this same gun now deals less damage for no reason.
---
I'd hope not. You think military could use a premium steel thst doesnt rust. I said blue balls cause he said cold rolled. Steel gets cold, I know he's ta L king a manufacture process but I'm talking cold ass ballsack
---
reminds me of when i was just chillin in my camp, and a scorchbeast corpse fell on me. i yelled What The Fuck, because i didnt know if it was dead.

To the besthesda defense squad that questionned whether we needed double walls or not. This is the answer: Y E S

Because it was free.

Charleston capital building, arkos pharma, whitesprings golf course, west tek, the burrows, repeat

XP, loot and legendaries; what more could you want?
---
I use mine.its a quad explosive
---
It with gorillas
---
What nerf is that? I did one tonight and it didn't seem any different to me. There were plenty of people at mine though.
---
I hope you went afk once you realized what they were doing.
---
That doesn't seem right.
---
Are you sure you're using a complete full set of Excavator because you don't get the carry bonus without a full set.  Also, do you have the leg mods for extra weight?
---
West of Flatwood.
---
Just some caps/junk. Not worth it. Better off just staying in the cave and farming the wendigos until the timer runs out.
---
lasers and teslas only, i think.
---
I want robot plushies , all of them !
---
you like jeremy clarkson, dont you?
---
Damn. He proved your point immediately. Probably blocked the person he was "tak[ing] damage" from in game too. üòÇ
---
In his lamp we shine!
---
Not sure about the specific nerf for Zealot‚Äôs, but thought they implemented an across-the-board nerds in the last patch, especially for bloodied.
---
Probably this.  That is why I have mine behind the rolling garage doors.  So when I hit close to cap cap I can block them quickly.
---
Do you still get the end of quest rewards if you stay in the cave? (Cursed weapons, plans)?
---
I‚Äôve yet to have a play through where Danse doesn‚Äôt end up wandering around that bunker in his underwear...
---
i think  they meant solid state drive.
---
Yes, "modder" can't patch issue with official server (private include with the current functionality) they can only do something with the client right now.
---
IMO the only way to add a full mods support is with an another community launcher that bring public, private server and event a single player options.
---
Public and private servers are hosted by the owners and when you want to join a public one, you download all the mods with a fully new characters. In this way the admin and modder can change many rules of the game like gold bullion, scrip and caps limit etc...
---
Some people probably know this, [FiveM](https://fivem.net/) it's exactly what i want but for fallout76.
---
That you react immediately negatively towards others criticism?
---
You going to be disappointed, it's the thing I wanted the most, but was a bit of a let down. It is tiny but still neat I suppose. What level you on .. no chance of hitting 78 ?
---
Wow
---
The chest only has a few caps and some junk. Nothing worthwhile.
---
üòÇ
---
Except I don't have a smart phone.  I guess I'm a dinosaur because all I have is a flip phone that ONLY does phone calls.
---
That nerf hasn't come out yet. Your post is early. Try again after patch 22!
---
I‚Äôm reported your reported everyone is reported! Lmfao
---
What you are saying makes sense for the boss type enemies.  I still think they need to buff the damage per shot because right now the slow firing weapons suck even on the smaller enemies which is where they should shine.  Something is very wrong when a weapon with RoF 6 does only twice the damage of one with RoF 91.
---
My dumb ass would not have even noticed that if you hadn‚Äôt said something
---
Nah, you get them, the only think you miss out on is a couple of trinkets from the exit chest, but i rather have the screws from the wendigo spawns to be honest
---
Yea I didn‚Äôt die yet...lol but yes twice in 1 day lol
---
I could have swarm a wastelanders quest brings you there. Why else would that building be instanced?
---
Ps4 records all of them even if deleted in game.  They just don't show up on loading screens. 
---
Check out your storage and see how many stupid photos you have. I had 400 something with so many awful ones that were taken for challenges.
---
All of us that play this game are across-the-board nerds.
---
You should also take claimed workshops. It is the best way to make the game fun. There is literally nothing bad or wrong about PvP/taking junk from others in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
---
Your camp will save when you move, the problem is you may not be able to place it back down. Depending on the terrain, you may or may not get lucky. If you can place it, when you move a blue print will automatically be created for you to try place it back down. Anything on the ground like water purifiers, you might want to store to be safe. People have 50/50 luck on replacing camps.
---
That is on the test server.  The damage recalculation is not live yet.
---
This happen on my las t Earle fight, I was both confused and horrified
---
Well that sucks. 
---
I was shredding all other scorched, but the SBQ seemed especially sponges. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yeah just stay in the cave and farm the wendigos. When the timer runs out your screen will fade to black and you'll be loaded back outside the mine and the quest will complete with all the rewards.
---
Only against lung diseases, none five damage resistance.
---
I‚Äôve tried everything to fix the lag too, port forwarding, wired connection and I don‚Äôt lag in any other games so I have no idea what‚Äôs going on in this game lately with the lag
---
Missing option - "convert all for xxx points" depending on quantity in inventory. Keep options for peeps wanting to offload excess.
---
See thats were i thought the cursed weapon and gas mask come from
---
I‚Äôd have stayed in the vendor, rubberbanded my controller, and taken a small break.   
---
People like that are the same mfs who‚Äôll ride your ass and honk when you‚Äôre driving the speed limit.
---
Weird. Thank!
---
Why did I read this in MODuS' voice?
---
and if not better skins to customize our appearance the way we need.
---
I've been using Collosal Problem to power level my friends, it's pretty funny that they have lv 20 cursed weapons!
---
Do you have the perks for it
---
When I enter it there‚Äôs a holo about lev and someone discussing a kind of weapons deal
---
As a power armor user, I agree with this suggestion
---
I buy maps all the time. It doesn‚Äôt take long to amass a good amount
---
roof of West Tek thank me later

good luck trying to participate in both at the same time tho.
---
How exactly do other players cause a problem with your sneak modifier? I've noticed no difference I  sneak damage with additional players when playing stealth. What another player does should not affect whether or not you are detected, only your own statistics and actions. If you are getting less sneak attack damage it is likely due to the adds detecting you. Stealth aside, I still see more health bar degradation in a small team, without stealth, I run heavy guns most of the time, so stealth is moot when doing so.
---
As far as I am concerned the fact that you have linked no data source likely means you have no supporting information, and as far as joining your discord, I have no interest as I don't play the game on PC and cannot contribute. You should also probably be careful advertising said group as I know a lot of subreddits don't allow it.
---
You suck at business
---
I've actually just scrapped one and it's given me lead and concrete. I only checked because a lead free lead pipe sounded dumb enough to be in this game.
---
There's nothing wrong with claiming an unclaimed workshop that's been built up. The previous owner left the server for one reason or another. My only question is when you said you "went around and stored all of the things," did you store all the turrets and things before leaving, or just the resources that were made? Because storing the actual defenses and resource extractors would be unnecessary and pointless. And bad!
---
And place the pool sticks.
---
Running with the salt perk at level 3 makes it feel near that - especially for cooked foods.  Essentially 90% reduction means 10x as much.
---
And with legendary perks coming out - will be much easier to fit it in.
---
if you are doing the workshop for the claim a workshop challenge, just get it claimed and then bail.
---
I mean, if it‚Äôs the same caliber from the same gun it‚Äôs odd that the 6 RoF is dealing twice the damage of the 91 RoF in the first place.
---
The 6 RoF might be more accurate, but it‚Äôs the same cartridge.
---
The Mothman backpack was so adorable now I wanna see a little baby Mothman plushi with glowing red eyes.
---
And getting out of the terminal is quick and easy on PC, just hit the escape key.
---
My biggest complaint is that the spoilage of food makes me essentially never want to afk or semi-afk.  (semi-afk being just screwing around, waiting for an event to pop, or someone to fire off SBQ, etc).
---
If it sells that means there's demand. I profit off the caps, I don't go to the nuke zones. People will buy at 1500, I've tested all sorts of cap ranges and they wILL buy at 1500.
---
we've been doing that for weeks and literally the same names pop up again and again?
---
You are prob correct I just know it‚Äôs coming. I forgot which patch. I think only thing coming this patch is one wasteland and daily ops.
---
Getting to play as a ghoul isn't just about changing appearance. Ghouls work much differently than humans, less effected negatively by chems, radiation heals instead of damages, unclear on the need for food/water to stay alive. Unclear on how easily they are fatigued, if really at all. 
---
Radaiton damage, to keep gameplay balanced would still have to work somewhat. Perhaps a ghoul PC couldn't take too much radiation or risk going feral (essentially death). But since radiarion heals ghoulsz that means it also wouldn't deal hp damage, it would have to work like in FO3 and NV where you just have a seperate radaiton meter. This would effectively eliminate a way to be a bloodied build 
---
No risk of addiction with chems, but they're effective time would need to be cut in half or more. Eliminates a way to be a junkies build. 
---
Fatigue could work the same, sprinting drains AP. 
---
Perhaps less food or water needed but also lesser benefits from eating/drinking. 
---
Super Mutants would also be a fun playable race, but again, they would have to function much differently.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ghoul_mask
---
Why that isn't in 76 is a mystery to me. I don't even care if ghouls still attack me, I just want to look as inhuman as possible.
---
Its bugged
---
I haven't even gotten to trying to optimize a build for the weapon, I'm stuck on why it seems to suck so much out of the box.  You're suggesting that without specific perks it's normal to see a 50% reduction from the stated per-shot damage?
---
if someone is in a group with you as a stealth toon, if you stand next to me firing a gauss minigun, it'll effect my stealth aswell. That's the only potential reason as to why a fight could take longer, unless people are lagging and arent hitting him properly :)
---
regarding the information, it's currently 2.30am here, i'll gladly dig up a source and reply with it tomorrow :) 
---
Thanks for the info regarding the recruitment bit :) But it shouldnt be an issue unless i paste the link in here. And there is no need to provide anything, the reason the dataminers went together is to combat misinformation just like the SBQ and other things scaling, amongst other reasons.
---
Im thinking there's some steps you need to take in order to force him come and fight you himself.
---
Maybe like the way Encryptid¬†works, make him have big bar of health and spawn minions of his to protect him. 
---
When it comes to character design maybe a ghoul version of himself?
---
Since the event will be public and doesn't need any work in order to start it like Encryptid does, add some decent loot like rare cosmetics which you can earn only by completing this event and stuff like that.
---
i think theres a fallout 4 mod for gat mini nukes.. its insane.
---
How is the event completed?  Killed the beast, then die and got transported outside.
---
That is an amazing idea and makes complete sense. Under armor would definitely fit on a person inside of power armor regardless, not to mention the much needed benefit when wearing power armor. For your genius I award you!
---
Bethesda make this happen!
---
Sorry wouldn‚Äôt know yet. I haven‚Äôt been lucky enough to find a crew to play it with sadly...
---
I've always appreciated the radroaches 'zero fucks' attitude. Especially when you see them charge out of a hiding spot to tank a deathclaw or something equally ridiculous.
---
What platform are you planning on? I was on Xbox earlier today and didn't have any lag like you described.
---
a lot of that stuff sounds expensive.
---
I‚Äôm on pc and I‚Äôve been asking a lot of people in discord too about this lag and a lot of people are complaining about it, just a lot of delays between doing anything in this game for some reason
---
Team PvP &amp; no more chains.
---
What
---
Can we get a clean toilet that also gives us water? I really need a toilet I can drink out of. also all of the toilet paper and 76 is backwards and completely unimmersive. This is completely game-breaking to see toilet paper and that's put on the wrong way while being near a toilet I cannot drink from the bowl or gather water from the tank.
---
I'll take one Whitespring assaultron plush that says "Sir" when I interact with it, please.
---
True, but this building doesn‚Äôt really fit the game (nice though it is) so it can be a bit of a circular argument.
---
Yes when a person owns a workshop all of the locked doors and such technically belong to them so if you unlock anything it‚Äôs technically considered stealing from said playerÔøº
---
It ould definitely need a high cost of valuable ingredients and even then it would be a pretty powerful item. 
---
Personally, I'd like to see a cure serum where depending on the final ingredient used, it determined which mutation it cures. Then we could cure specific mutations as needed when we want to adjust our build instead of the messy way it is now.
---
I‚Äôm not saying it 50% less but with the right perks you could get more damage out of it
---
eh... that could be cool but it kills canon. zorbo‚Äôs not a real canonical person besides being in a comic book in the fallout universe, so there would have to be some sort of justification behind the concept for it to be viable in the sense you‚Äôre talking about.
---
I expected the "freezers" to stop foods from spoiling rather than only slow down
---
Nope, lol.
---
https://youtu.be/-WHQAP6-W9g
---
This should answer your broadside questions.
---
TLDR - Nope, you're good
---
Got anything worthwhile to trade for it? Don't really need caps
---
2 questions
---
- Is really THAT unplayable? My PC is fairly old and i can play it with no major problems. It lags a little, like it lags sometimes when there re tons of enemies and explosions (like lines in the sand) but o can still aim and shoot. 
---
- does it happen with other laser weapons?
---
It sucks big time cause Tesla are really handy against swarm of enemies
---
Im sorry, i didnt know. I thought that killing mass wendigos was good. I apologize, i will stop
---
My buddy had an unground camp where you sit in nice comfy chairs and watch the nuke launch. Really, really cool.
---
I‚Äôd say almost certainly referring to instanced interiors. If they could‚Äôve expanded the exterior camp budget, they would‚Äôve done it by now.
---
In the high 30's early 40's i think? Not sure, i'm in the second part of it.
---
Do we actually know how long it's gonna be active? or is it just as vague as "when zorbo gets there"?
---
Yea all the stuff inside was added with wastelanders. I just thought a quest brought you there. Weird.
---
I just want more pistol viability, Bethesda pls
---
I'm perfectly happy playing a revolver-wielding gunslinger but damn at least give us some customization options ;-;
---
I've checked. I am using the new Communist PA skin. Maybe that's bugging the numbers out.
---
I vaguely remember another skin from the atom shop bugged out your rad protection while in your PA.
---
I'll double check the next time I log in.
---
Hilariously, the simplest way to can food involves a pot and water. You put glass jars with metal lids and a rubber or wax seal into a pot of boiling water and boil them until the jars seal. That‚Äôs it.
---
We can build *fusion generators* but we can‚Äôt can a jar of pickles. XD
---
Tell that to Whitesprings Resort
---
Every enemy and non hostile creature needs a plush. You can't change my mind.
---
I'll take one protectron plushie that says "maaa'aaaaaam" when I interact with it, please.
---
I stand shat on.
---
That escalated quickly.
---
No paid upgrades because we already got junk box but if something like ESO I‚Äôm down with it, feels like they gotta increase after every big update but it‚Äôs paid and better be no more then 500 atoms for a upgrade. Maybe 500 atoms for 500 space.
---
Why not? If the switch worked you still would be able to cut the power with another switch.
---
Thanks!  I searched here, but didn't think to search YouTube.
---
It took two seconds to Google "does the scorchbeast scale based off players?"
---
The answer to a post I got said no with proof. It was over a year ago. 
---
Tldr; does not scale, takes 30% damage from all sources. Armor might accidentally scale because of lag with more people there (its not intended) but also two people wouldn't make a noticeable enough difference. As with the scorchbeast it was about 20 people.
---
Making me wanna crush up some Cheetos and mix them with lukewarm ramen
---
Power armor ain't worth it even with underarmor. Throw in some more perk cards that increase damage dealt and we have a possible build.
---
That channel is a great resource for most weapons.
---
.45 for the 6 and 10mm for the 91.  I don't feel like there is that much realism in this game though. :P
---
Crazy I hopped servers for like 25 minutes and it eventually worked. So annoying. I‚Äôm on PC
---
Ah wel just spam the collect key in a stream and boil 100 water. At least it gives exp
---
At the very least add it as a learnable plan and give me some level 45 chainsaws.
---
Look up FO76 Silo wall glitch. You can get it done sub 10 mins and avoiding 90% of the bullcrap.
---
I haven't seen anyone 1 shot it, but I've seen pretty damn close.
---
You can actually get one from the machine? I thought it was just a 'joke' machine..
---
A lot of countries also give undrinkable water out of the sinks. If we go to Egypt for a holiday it's fine to brush your teeth but swallow a bit and your stuck on the toilet for a week.

Frostbite would lead to black balls. The blue ones are caused by.. something else

Yes, I know what they meant, but their "high end PC" is running on an SD.

You should be running Liberty Prime Power Armor.

#**DEATH IS A PREFERABLE ALTERNATIVE TO COMMUNISM!**
---
Btw how did you do the curved rows of steel bars as a "wall"?
---
Forever ago the factions (or their vendors anyway) had their own cap pools. This was changed awhile back to all vendors having a global cap pool. The caps reset 20 hours after your first sale to any vendor.
---
Ikr.   Been trying to get that thing to drop for weeks
---
My only hopes for this game is they really focus on fixing the bugs instead of rolling out new content.  Seems like it's becoming more and more buggy as time goes on. I love this game but sometimes the bugs really ruin it.
---
yes please
---
Thanks, I could only find sources from like 2018 so I thought I'd better ask here and it appears I was right to, I'm guessing there's no other way to sell for caps other than to players when the vendors are out of caps?
---
The ammo converter is ridiculously unnecessarily difficult.
---
I'm not trying to be a dick but yes please do stop.  It doesn't exactly help when everyone's frame rate drops to 5.  It sucks that an effective weapon has been essentially taken out of the pool of useful tools.  the person shooting the gun may be totally unaware from my experience as their frame rate seems to be less affected.  We nearly lost because two players noped out on me at the end because they weren't able to continue playing at the frame rate. But advance like line in the sand and guided meditation are actually worse because there are more mobs to turn into ash piles.  Events where there is one main enemy and a few smaller ones seem to be less of a problem.
---
Ok you won me over . 
---
Make the goddamn button work Beth , wtf
---
Tip: Use the Ash Pile mod from Nexus and change them into NW loot bags. Temporary solution which isn't immersive, but neither is that horrible, horrible lag
---
Not gonna lie, way too much to read so I didn‚Äôt XD
---
Start with a simple foundation and snap a metal beam on the side then another on top of that. then blueprint them. Once you have done that you will be able to place the blueprinted version anywhere you want without them snapping
---
I use this one.  
---
Sorry, but i don't remember the name, i bought this costume with a discount on it.  
---
 https://imgur.com/efCKyzQ
---
I appreciate it!
---
Wow!  So the youtuber also saw (at most) 50% of the stated damage, and usually way less.  Very sad.  Thanks for the link
---
originally I thought it was the meat piles as well but I never have any problems unless someone is creating numerous ash piles with a Tesla.  Radiation rumble and line in the sand both became unplayable because of the same player. numerous other players were asking him to please switch weapons but he didn't seem to care or believe us.  I'm not sure if he was confused when the remaining four players all noped  out of the event
---
Ok karen
---
I mean it's frustrating to me as well this glitch started soon after I obtained a Tesla.  I had no problems before the last patch but if you Google this issue it's pretty well narrowed down to the ash piles. as the person using the Tesla my frame rate doesn't suffer nearly as much as when someone else is doing it.  But when it was pointed out to me by other players I was at least polite enough to change weapons as to not ruin the event.  I truly appreciate others that have also switched out their weapons so that we can all play.
---
I've never seen clipping issues with the jetpack. And very few backpacks as well. I don't think jetpack should be hidden though. Maybe backpacks
---
Did you do double walls to achieve the white exterior walls?
---
I'm determined to save all my atoms for holiday stuff, but those damn plushies keep calling to me! üòñ
---
Yeah sadly the broadsider is not good.  Maybe they fix it someday.
---
Let's place the onus on the players instead of holding the game developers accountable for breaking the fucking game every time they implement any changes. Yeah, death to Tesla users cuz they're really the problem. üôÑ
---
Yeah with that filthy concrete base it really doesn't look like an indoor item but I want it to be :( cleaner and nicer.
---
Yes, all walls are double
---
Answer to question, yes it is that unplayable for many people.  On my computer it's frame rate drops that are usually characterized as annoying not game-breaking.  Playing on a console when I'm at a friend's house I would categorize it as game-breaking.  I am not sure about other laser weapons but I know that being the person shooting the Tesla's seem to to not make as much a difference to me as being in the event with someone else doing it.
---
nuclear winter will come out of beta
---
Having the same problem exactly at this moment. Except I have the Chinese stealth armor so I haven‚Äôt run out of any thing. Just super annoying to gat to re trace my steps countless times to try again. Have you had any luck with a new world so far? I‚Äôve been working on this for like 2 hours and changed worlds several times
---
Yup. Sell legendaries also. If anything people will buy Them for scrip value at the purveyor. Also get to know the market for legendaries and rare plans and clothing. For example I sold a forest scout mask for 100 caps, then found out the value and sold the next one for 15k.
---
For legendaries I think can sell, and these are slightly higher prices but still sell somewhat quickly. I do this
---
Weapons:
---
1* 200 caps
---
2* 500 caps
---
3* 1000 caps
---
Armor:
---
1* 100 caps
---
2* 250 caps
---
3* 500 caps
---
But if I know the price of what people are looking for and paying I can raise it higher. Just sold an armor piece for 10k
---
Nice! I was going to ask about the plans but the I  noticed the interior wall looked doubled. It looks amazing by the way!
---
[deleted]
---
Yea I have maybe 9 of them from the last months of play (I usually click the one at the purveyor on the way in and out). I read you need very high luck to increase your chance for it to come out. Which is probably why I have 9.
---
Don't worry, I rocked the level 10 bag well into level 50 before I realized it could be upgraded.
---
Plot twist: The next one contains the Wendigo Collosus
---
Hmm. Thanks. I never use PA but I did notice the picture of the board. The fireplace and chicken coop made me pretty happy, though.
---
I hadn't noticed that but that makes sense because I have heard some audio glitches and wasn't sure which builds to attribute it to.  don't get me wrong this is not the players fault it's a Bethesda thing that should have been fixed.  I'm just asking that on important events or events that people have started don't come in with a game-breaking weapon even though it's not your fault it's game-breaking.
---
Thanks for the tip man, now I can make sure I don't get ripped off with buying too
---
I literally snap a photo of my ammo before using it, ridiculous machine
---
Thank you for the reward bro!
---
Also cut a hole out of the back panel so I can keep my back pack on too plz, ty.
---
It's more of a gimmick weapon than a real viable one.
---
Scratch that. I just logged completely out and resigned into my account then joined a world and boom. The doors were already open for me. Weird.
---
I have crazy luck with those and my luck is only level 4. I‚Äôve gotten three and one was on my first try. This low level kept trying to get it and I try once and received it. I traded it to him for one cap.
---
When it doesn't kill the framerate it's actually kind of an interesting visual effect.  I'm not exactly sure if it's a sheer volume of ash piles that starts killing framerate but even a few seemed to do the pixelation bug.  I guess the reason I'm bringing it up now is because we have an event that takes a decent amount of resources and planning on one player's part.  people complain that they invest in launching the nuke and get stuck in the event with a bunch of low-level players.  I would rather be stuck with low-level players than have my frame rate drop to an unplayable speed because of the ash pile glitch.
---
I have done Colossal Problem a half dozen times with no problems. Haven't disconnected in months. The idea that qol is antithetical to bug fixes is false. Vats being broken is a serious, frustrating bug. As is rubber banding enemy health, but the idea the game isn't orders of magnitude better, that the new content doesn't make the game so much funner, is false in my mind. Public teams are the best qol addition to game since vending. I strongly disagree with your position
---
Lol same
---
My worst nightmare. Thank god my lowest fps is around 80
---
It kind of looks like the Power Armor from Fallout: Tactics.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power\_armor\_(Fallout\_Tactics)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power_armor_(Fallout_Tactics))
---
Does it label the model as "Enclave" in the game's data?
---
If I remember correctly there were like 3 peices of legendary power armor in fallout four and two were from dlc
---
Yeah just give it a slider and show the nrs. Just like putting them in stash
---
I am so sorry. Thank you for notifiying and bring level headed!
---
If you just need to be able to fast travel, look into getting the recipe for Rad Ant Lager. Crafted at the brewing station, recipe randomly unlocked for completing the daily Tipsy Taste Test/ Wasted On [alcohol] quest. Adds 50 to your carry weight for 1 minute, then drops your carry weight by 100(so -50 to your standard carry weight) for 1 minute. It's beer, so it doesn't spoil. I always carry a bottle or two. It requires ant meat, which can found somewhat reliably. Power substation north of Watoga, fighting a high level deathclaw. They are also a frequent attacker at the Tea Time event. Butcher's bounty for double meat.
---
because bethesda lazy, just add it to the pile of unfinished weapons lacking mods.
---
This "rumour" exists because not everyone cares about the notes and just want to get the event done as quickly as possible. Especially for the challenge dailies/weeklies that require you to finish events and get XP, it makes more sense to just get the event over with quickly.
---
I myself asked people to let the Mirelurks reach the island, if they wanted to finish the quest faster. So far, nobody complained.
---
you know what, ive never used robotics but that sounds like a great idea
---
The fire place honestly has more value to me then the last tiers rewards combined. I love it :D
---
It happened to me for the first time today, it was unplayable, just barely ran but I had to spend the entire time spamming stimpacks or hiding, couldn‚Äôt so much as turn and could only aim with vats
---
Every other time has been smooth
---
I only pick them up because of the lead scrap. And in construction irl i find most lead pipes filled with concrete
---
Ill start with i absolutely love this game and usualy play it 1.5-2 hours a day after the kiddo is in bed, and am going ro continue to do so.
---
But in reality, as bitter as it is to say i cant see this game lasting more than another 3-5 years max. Sure there will still be players, but with next gen consoles on the horizon its going to be left in the dust. Creation engine is already very dated, with the new stuff thats coming out theres not much of a comparison. Its just too limited. 
---
Anyways i do hope they keep bringing on the new content. Other than bug fixes the things id like to see are a bunch more weapons to be added, and more endgame bosses. I love the new colossus fight,  keepem coming.
---
Hold Cancel button (B on xbox)
---
He posted this in expectation of a handjob and public outcry of ong he didnt only to find nobody cares then started getting defensive,  typical redditing
---
Ikr. Ridiculous . We need an exit hot key.
---
Communism is the only way! 
---
Just except it!
---
Wtf kind of amazing and beautiful magic is this? Fallout interior designer for hire?
---
Press and hold the back button. This works on all nested terminals as well.
---
Aliens expansion
---
I'll have to try this next time. Thankfully It didn't take as long as I thought it would üòÇ.
---
Opened up dollhouse look. Must took him many hours
---
Too bad there's no Zorbo costume. You could make your own event by having two players face off with alien blasters.
---
Ive been using an anti armor Tesla at events since about halfway through the legendary run to farm xp quicker. Never noticed any lag (aside from the normal Bethesda lag). Is it something that affects people other than the user or something? Or maybe just some random chance of it happening?
---
Thanks very much
---
Git gud
---
That sounds fun
---
Honestly, I would take a years worth of bug fixes over a years worth of content...if it meant actually fixing all the bugs in the game.
---
anything is possible :p
---
Something like Mothership Zeta?
---
By Team PvP do you mean the ability to PvP within your own team? Or your team PvPing with other teams?
---
ok
---
ESO is superior to FO76 in every way and it sketches me out that the same parent company has such massively different standards. I still prefer 76 because I like Fallout‚Äôs setting, but ESO is a perfect example of a rough launch turned success story.
---
Sweet
---
Time travel.... Fallout 3 takes place 6 hours from this games location..... and honestly, given the state of DC, it's hard to feel like choices matter in this prequel
---
I did a week ago and got the buggy shitgun
---
Works on all terminals, fyi. Saves some time.
---
Anyone else been seeing more frequent Mothman sightings since the last update? I hadn‚Äôt had a random encounter  with him once in the over 100 hours I‚Äôve put in so far but have seen him twice in the last two days. I got into a fight with him the second time cause I got to close trying to take a picture and acted out of self defense. Got him down to half health and he took off and disappeared. Was relieved that he just left and I didn‚Äôt have to kill him. Kinda wish that this was the case with all encounters and you couldn‚Äôt actually kill him, he just dips in and out.
---
Yeah man
---
A magical one? Nice. I guess you one-shot everything.
---
As long as it's not like Longneck Lukowski's Cannery
---
I'm on Xbox and beside the usual framedrops during the queen or big events everything has been fine.
---
Note:I'm not counting the basically unplayable collasal problem event as it's new on Xbox gonna give it a little more time.
---
Me too
---
he was pissed, cost him a lot more junk than the 4 wood he got from me.  salty or not all came up roses for me, got a 3* bloodied tesla from that run.  he knows many 4 letter words, but is not smart enough to have his camp in the unnukable forest. hahaha
---
Is there a difference between 20 minutes and 20 fucking minutes? Like maybe the difference between a ton, a fuck ton, and a metric fuck ton?
---
Yeah a public boss like the schochbeast queen and wendigo collousus but maybe not a nuke to start it like encrypted and for the last week of the seaon
---
You know, the whole thing with the Creation Engine being dated always makes me laugh considering that people still regularly play games like Morrowind, Fallout 3/NV and Skyrim on the regular. I'd bet that even Fallout 4 will still be popular over the next decade simply because of modding alone. As much as we love to complain about the outdated-ness of the Creation Engine, we sure love to keep playing the games that run on it.
---
And yeah, more weapons would be beautiful. Pistols need variety, badly. A .50 Desert Eagle, something that doesn't use .44 rounds please lmao. I'm also hoping we get more endgame bosses similar to Earle. I think it's definitely going to happen, Bethesda is just gonna be slow with updates as they always have been.
---
I like that they drop the ammo you use. Even ultracite
---
Hold exit button, my dude
---
Both have their benefits and weaknesses. Fusion cells, and the necessary perk cards weaken power armor some. I noticed that in power armor I can't have both - my regular armor gives many more bonuses, and more perk cards work without PA. If I use my military power armor, I lose about 30% of my carry capacity. If I use excavators, my carry capacity is the same... But I lose damage reduction from all my bolstering affices on my bloodied build. Max str, radicool, barbarian, etc can make you a juggernaut without power armor. It does seem that stim packs inject faster in power armor, I assume because the armor does it for you.
---
Something like and better. A full new alien theme, faction quests, cosmetics, camp items, weapons, allies or companions. It could be huge, but too much dreaming for today
---
The only thing you‚Äôll lose is junk, it‚Äôs not like older fallout games where you lose progress, so don‚Äôt worry about it man, kill anything or run away from anything you want
---
Yoy could get a full set of legendary t-60 through the bos questline if you played your cards right. Plus the tesla armor
---
What exactly are you trying to say? That you'd like to be able to travel to DC in the same time period 76 takes place in? Apologies if I'm missing the point.
---
Maybe a reskin for the encrypted event
---
You honestly don't lose anything in my friend before I go into a fight since I'm fall out first I put down a camp and put all my junk away before I go in there just in case.
---
 Nah, it‚Äôll damage your armor though.
---
It‚Äôs really been stopping me from progressing with missions as everything is a really high level compared to what I‚Äôm comfortable with so usually I just run
---
Nope, one the secrets of fallout games is sometimes its easier to just die, save your stimpacks and ammo.
---
If you die while over encumbered (not with junk) you may have to respawn back at Vault 76, so there's that!
---
Yes, I will "except" communism.
---
Everything "except" communism is the right way to go.
---
Used to carry 3 to chew into the underbelly of the the SBQ.  Ah, the memories
---
You lose some off your buffs like well tuned and well rested but those can be gotten back easy enough by sleeping and playing instruments
---
This would also help decrease the lag issues.
---
Probably a good strat tbh
---
Funny how many post I see of people wanting to trade the 5% drop rate mining mask,  which can be spawn anytime via this event for legacies....I dont even think its worth 30,000 caps, drop rates too high,
---
I'm already good though, solo 20 kills in a game
---
Go full unyielding. Ya just can‚Äôt beat the perk bonus.
---
Also bring back visibly holstered weapons.
---
No idea. Unless you have a burner acct I wouldn‚Äôt risk it.
---
Nukes don't work that way radiation wise
---
Plus there‚Äôs no better feeling than going back and getting revenge on the enemy that put you down. Even if it takes a couple of times.
---
I usually just go back to base and store stuff before I try a mission or go somewhere with high level enemies
---
You're at the lv 30 difficulty hump. Try to stick to western north and south regions (and stay out of the high level eastern regions) and start looking for the lv 45 or 50 gun that you want to end up using.
---
Your lv 30 and lv 35 weapons, at least in your first playthrough, should help you determine what legendary effects work for your build. 
---
You are also right around the level where mutations become viable, since starched genes is unlocked. Some mutations will ease your difficulty.
---
Ps4? I think I got to see it or one like it
---
I gave up on it. I don't have time to remember how much I have of each ammo type.
---
Im getting on now publicenemywon
---
I'd found that before (but lost it, thanks for resharing), but I don't see any way to actually see rarity on that.   Only a big list.
---
I usually don‚Äôt focus on that stuff anyway tbh, I just play without worrying about that stuff even though I should probably focus on it and look into the boosts I get
---
I love riding shotgun it‚Äôs on my little route I take  but lately I havn‚Äôt been getting any outfit s or masks 16 times and nothing then finally I got an outfit then another I was getting worried
---
I‚Äôve not looked into any mutations or even mods tbh, I just don‚Äôt know where to start with it all, I‚Äôve just been playing as it is tbh, not really looked in depth at anything, the guns I use atm are a level 10 legendary sniper that I really need to replace but don‚Äôt to where to start and I‚Äôve just started using the fixer which I do like tbh
---
There is the candy claws skin from xmas
---
I've actually already got a full set of unyeilding I'm just trying to get a 3 star god set basically, I may trade one bolstering for lifesaving and one for chameleon
---
This. DR is not that effective after a certain point, and a full ss set definitely takes you to that point!
---
Yeah, that would feel good tbh
---
I hope we eventually venture outside of appilachia
---
Thanks for sharing, hadn't found that before ... but it seems to have the same issue as the list above.   It's a massive list of all the plans/etc ... but zero rarity details.   So no way to look at them and go "Here are the rare ones"
---
Why do I get the feeling that there's a lot of stuff they could add and want to, but the engine just can't handle it..
---
They should have used the Elder Scrolls Online engine. Basically just made a ESO fallout clone. Give us the entire US. They could have even released payed for expansions. Like have all the cities we've been to be available, but cut off (and released further down the line) just like ESO does.
---
I hope they go that route if they ever make another online Fallout. This game could be so fucking fun with so many features and additions. But it's clearly the engine just can't fucking handle it.
---
I play on Xbox and there's like 14 people on the map on a good day. No events barely pop up AT All. It takes them hours and hours in between. They need to start releasing large map expansions that load into an entire new map, because everything's got so stale now. 
---
They can't keep this game alive with just the Appalachia map.
---
I added u i see ur not on. Tomorrow if i see u get on ill run around and grab as many as i can for u and give u some i have.
---
Also a few of my missions now are trying to force me into the eastern parts but not the most eastern sometimes and there‚Äôs still level 50‚Äôs
---
I was a little annoyed because I wanted parts of the bundle for my Unstoppables CAMP and had to buy the plushie separately. I have no interest in icons or photo frames. I wish we could pick what we want in the bundle. That Grelok photo frame is awful too. I dig the emote, weapon skin, chair, and costume.
---
O for sure fallout has a die hard fallowing. Hell new vegas and FO3 are still going. 
---
Only difference being 76 is online only, and needs to bring in money. It costs Bethesda to keep her going. If you player count drops significantly than so does your income.  There will be a point in which  they shut it down unfortunately. I think new and interesting titles will be a major cause of this. Especially with next gen graphics and game engines. The first year or two of next gen it will be fine. But when developers really start to take advantage and build games around the next gen rather than make game fit both generations (much like when ps4 came out)  it will be a whole new level.
---
Even now look at RDO vs FO76 in terms of graphics and animations. On ps4 RDO is absolutely beautiful (even more so on PC), yet 76 looks like it came from last gen/early ps4. Again i adore this game, but its rapidly becoming dated.
---
I can always repair that I suppose
---
Anything you build where the mats show up in green (on PC) is coming from the workshop stash, not your personal stuff. So the person who built that stuff probably didn't use much of their own mats if any. I can build 5 extractors and a fusion generator and it costs me almost nothing in mats (perking Contractor).
---
Adding a shower when we got bunkers in the game isn't exactly the best idea. Just saying.
---
Or maybe it could incorporate all those glass canning jars and metal ring lids we pick up!
---
By the market, generally don't sell anything with bloodied, junkies without checking the this sub or a forum.
---
There are a ton of other stuff worth buckets but many are varied and it takes time to learn.
---
Current meta is bloodied, then junkies, and 9 times out of 10 these are worth more than their other legendary counterparts.
---
That means it's never coming. And if it does do you really expect it to be good? Not hating, just don't get your hopes up.
---
I had a small obsession playing F04 as I used to collect any pool balls I found trying to fill up my whole pool table....
---
Grafton monster plush?
---
I'd just be happy if it didnt take up 60% of my screen
---
It's a video game. They're a video game company. Stop making excuses for them so they can just keep updating a game with limited stuff.
---
I'm a 100% cannibal raider who kills settlers. Yet I can waltz into Foundation like its nothing. So don't use stupid excuses like that lmao. It's an online fallout game.  There's also friendly Super Mutants, one being in the goddamn country, Graham. So stop using stupid excuses. Being a ghoul or something would be an incredible experience to a game that's getting more and more lacklustre. All they'd have to do is making Foundation become Hostile and you get insta deathed going near it by turrets. Simple. 
---
If it were up to you, the game would be how it was at launch.
---
While you're at it, give me one for my camp.
---
I saw that one too! Took a picture of it to show my daughter, she demanded I keep it as a loading screen.
---
It‚Äôs either *The Importance of Communication* or *Retirement Plan*.
---
Thanks!
---
Man just listed the Cod Zombies mystery Box list üíÄüíÄüíÄ
---
Frame go bye
---
Me too bro me too
---
You can get the plan for free by running the patrol duty event at the prison.  It‚Äôs at welch station as well.
---
God forbid an "RPG" gets RPG elements from the community. Go sit in your camp all night and lock yourself in your workshop room you boring bastard.
---
I don't disagree. I suppose I'm just holding out hope that Bethesda will realize the game has serious potential and start putting resources into the game that would enable it to stand up with other games of the type. Obviously, that will take tons of money and like you said, if player numbers start dwindling, it'll mean the end of new content for 76. The graphics of Bethesda games always look dated when compared to other modern games but for some reason we just can't stop playing them lol
---
I'm pretty sure you cannot access the stuff you stored at that workshop when you go back to your own CAMP. Afaik, they're just gone now.
---
What platform? At sign in screen? Or once you've spawned onto the map?
---
I'd also like to see this. Most likely implemented through a new expansion similar to how a game like WoW or SWTOR would do it. Though I think it's extremely unlikely unless 76 sticks around for another decade or more.
---
Yea why the meat piles have fly animation still escapes me
---
There is no way it could be flagged. Unless it‚Äôs a straight up sting op by Beth.
---
Heavy weapons
---
My top three.
---
1. Faction public teams-slight buffs for playing as your favorite faction.
---
2. 500 daily scrip-its my favorite gameplay loop. Legendary hunting and scripping useless stuff. Then trying for new gear with purveyor or selling in my vending machines.
---
3. Multiple camp modules-give me camp module A, B, and C. I choose which camp I want loaded in to the server. This would let people build to their hearts content without having to scrap existing builds.
---
Try to explore the toxic wastes area up north and Ash heap down south, should be lots of side and misc quests to keep you busy for now.
---
Edit: and yes, not having a preferred weapon type and current level weapon to go with it will hinder your progress for sure:)
---
If you like snipers and rifles, try to find a lever action - either buy the plan at one of the whitespring vendors and make some, scrap for mods and use, or if you find one you like at a player vendor. 
---
Fixers are great. Ammo hungry though. Also try handmade, it's got similar performance.
---
I wanna be able to pet the doggos and the foxes too...and we should be able to rescue those stray cats as well while we're at it
---
A clean bath would be nice too
---
And the kitties
---
I have a junkies explosive Gatling gun
---
I‚Äôll have a look to see what I can do but there‚Äôs one mission in the ash part I‚Äôm doing atm where it‚Äôs retrieve Becketts belongings and there a few level 56‚Äôs there
---
Plenty of fun alien lore.  Maybe a battle against his spacecraft, never lands.  Happens often against the queen.
---
Ok I will take it what level is it
---
I would preserve so much cranberry relish.  My antioxidant levels are extremely healthy.
---
Freinds list been borked lately
---
Im with you there. Id love to see this game thrive, and stand the test of time.
---
There certainly is something special about their games, just keep coming back.
---
Same. I'm excited for the cloth donation just because I have so much of it that I'm never going to use. I think I'm sitting on roughly 2k-3k worth of it by this point. I'm more than happy to get rid of it for the project, even more so if it means we get another collectron!
---
Yesss
---
1. Love the idea. Not just Settlers or Raiders either. It'd be nice to see unique buffs for Responders/Fire Breathers, Enclave, BoS, Cult of the Mothman(???), etc. teams as well! I feel like this would be a chance for them to flesh out factions a bit too. Joining the Fire Breathers felt like such an accomplishment after everything you heard about them and then...nothing. It was just lackluster after that.
---
2. Scrip absolutely needs a boost. 500 sounds good. All these posts about people not being able to scrap legendaries for scrip because they hit their limit or their stash is at its limit, etc. Hands down, this is something that needs to be addressed immediately.
---
3. Another great idea! Not sure how they'd implement it as I'm sure they'd find some way to bug it all to hell...and I can already see exploiters with 3 camps on the map lol, definitely an interesting idea though.
---
The sign in screen
---
It will fade as you get older. But a large part of the economy is based on making young consumers feel like they'll miss out if they don't buy product X. Breaking free of this will make you happier.
---
I'm not really a PA fan but the Power Fist literally has power in the name and it boggles my mind that this is a weapon that can't be used with PA. It looks like something that would absolutely be wielded by someone in a powerful mechanized suit of armor.
---
This is a good idea
---
Check again, friend. It scraps into [Lead and Concrete](https://imgur.com/gallery/8fcMXzY).
---
I have to disagree.
---
One big flaw with 76 is theres no real player hub for players to hang out, socialize, trade ect.
---
It was supposed to be whitesprings but we saw how that turned out. Players are so scattered its easy to play for hours without seeing one even in a full lobby.
---
If anything we need more reasons for players to all go to certain locations/towns.
---
I'm relieved to hear it's still a possibility, even if it's a long way off. When the emotes got removed after being available for as long as they were, I worried the pets were canceled.
---
It wasn‚Äôt instanced before Wastelanders but I‚Äôve done the Raider quest on 5 different characters and it never led me there. Looking forward to seeing the changes. Again, maybe a setup for the upcoming Brotherhood stuff?
---
The wildcard is what makes it fun. I think they should take away perk cards and healing items.
---
Hey I was having the same problem but when I reloaded the game it wasn't asking me to put the blood sample back in. Only the T fuse... so I was messing around, like one guy did keeping all the doors closed and what not... I went in the main entrance next to the hole, jumped down the hole and every door i opened i closed behind me. I checked the computer first and tried to analyze the blood before putting the T fuse in (no objective for putting the blood sample in). And it let me analize the blood... then I put the T fuse in and it let me progress. I hope you guys have as much luck as I did
---
OP is incorrect. It scraps into Lead and Concrete. Not Steel and Concrete.
---
I'm so glad I've finished the Legendary Run so I feel less guilty about snapping up the plushies this week. 
---
Top of the wishlist for me is the scorchbeast queen and imposter sheepsquatch. We have an Earle, it would be nice if the other two bosses got one. Also a mothman and deathclaw one would be nice.
---
Swap server if needed
---
Cryo freeze to post Fallout 4... Seems like anything we accomplish here doesn't have any lasting effects in the Fallout universe since we have games in the future that make no mention of the vast gold reserve backed currency on W. Virginia.
---
I do sometimes.
---
But... they‚Äôre changing the alien blaster and giving pistols armor piercing. I don‚Äôt see very many pistol builds and I never see alien blasters in play. I think they wouldn‚Äôt everything but auto rifles and heavy guns fall by the wayside.
---
Right?! I opened this post because I was like 'there's a limit? What has it been doing with all picks - I must have hundreds.' and then I realized I'm on PC and they are all just sitting out there.
---
You can tame a dog
---
When Bethesda found out that we wanted a multiplayer Fallout, they assumed that we wanted a Fortnite meets Fallout game with wacky outfits, goofy masks and ridiculous dancing emotes when really all we wanted to do was explore the wastes with our friends at our sides.
---
Unarmed has been an afterthought since Fallout 4. It feels incidental that it's more powerful in Fallout 76 than it was in Fallout 4, because it's still pretty clear it's an afterthought with just how much of a lack of variety your choices are. AGAIN. Because it was a problem in 4 too.
---
It's really annoying they made it unable to be used in power armor, and it was probably only because they had to deal with potential clipping, so I guess rather than try to rectify it, they completely removed the option.. Even though there are other smaller weapons have clipping with power armor too.
---
Honesty though man. The bear arm is even worse about it. I love my melee weapons but damn lemme see
---
See I respect this answer
---
Please. I just rolled a really good (in theory) Gauss shotgun for my build and it sucks that it's bugged so much. It's fun to use but I hate that it's less viable than the pump action one I have.
---
Because pistols have a damage issue. Rifles are worth their weight. You'll be fine.
---
This glitch you speak of does not exist
---
Atom Shop Request: Trump's bathroom. Includes a mini prefab with golden tub, sink and toilet.
---
Can you tame the cats? I've tried but they never show up.
---
This makes sense, caps cap should be higher for sure
---
You can actually spawn it. Just speak to the guy in charge and as long as it hasn't been done in the last hour it will start
---
Yes it does suck but I use it everyday
---
How about rip them out of every train station, Foundation and Crater and make them free for players CAMP? I‚Äôd be down for that. There are usually about the same number of CAMPs as there are stations, and there‚Äôs more to do at player CAMPs as well. So we‚Äôd encounter each other more than before AND have these tools at our home base.
---
Level 50
---
That‚Äôs smart I‚Äôll have to try it. You can also do it with getting out of power armor. You can glitch into the vendor at the rusty pick this way. All the guns behind him too you can grab :)
---
Going to crater should trigger one of them if you've finished wastelanders
---
The only doors I have are curtains, lol
---
There‚Äôs only a few games where my PS4 pro struggles to run and during this event my god, my PS4 sounded like it was going up in flames and my frame rate must of gone down to 2fps multiple times I don‚Äôt even know what the problem is... as well as my screen started to get pixilated
---
So how about plasma?
---
Yeah true, I guess clarification that it is still happening is better then just wondering.
---
Glad to hear I‚Äôm not the only one....LOL
---
I mean you could put ground switches on both sides, but that‚Äôs a pain, I wouldn‚Äôt do that
---
Looking for group, the best and only place to look for quickly accessible events.
---
Your only option is to turn them into script.
---
Outfits and hats only have a low drop chance if ALL 4 missing supply packages are found.
---
I never said it was the most pressing problem in the world, but it certainly would be nice.
---
With tank killer affecting pistols, it means that every weapon type except shotguns have armor piercing (and shotguns are relatively fine without it since they can cripple limbs in one hit, allowing them to render enemies borderline useless). Weapon weight cards are in a similar vein - every weapon class except bows and rifles have access to one. I don‚Äôt see why rifles shouldn‚Äôt have one, and since packing light is mostly useless for pistols (who are generally extremely light anyway, being no more than 10 pounds at the absolute worst), it would give the card more of a use.
---
Up until i last played the game vanilla, FO4 had the same issue with ash piles persisting and it would cause save bloat. It wasnt until mods were allowed on the PS4 that a solution was available for me. It staggers me honestly that the same issue carried over to a whole new game and still remains unaddressed. They werea problem in FO4 and they are a problem now
---
You don‚Äôt even have to finish it!

---
Monster mash.  No one EVER joins and I generally get 3 to 6 three stars, plus amazing experience and rares for completing each step.  It is stupid easy with my shotgun.  
---
Grab mask, run to bucket, stand in corner, hear footsteps- VATS kill.  Rinse repeat.
---
Not to mention the 150ish plastic and loot from kills.
---
I def think it‚Äôs Beth‚Äôs fault,first &amp; foremost...
---
Down to little things like us STILL not having a mountain scout mask/hat/helm w/e...
---
But it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Tesla‚Äôs make it tough sometimes.
---
Same here, I love the way it fires and the way it looks, particularly with the clandestine paint and the ammo isn't too bad to make. I ran an anti-armor one but I got blessed by Mumbles who gave me a 3* Medic one (Medic shotgunner build) with ffr and faster reload. It feels bugged beyond belief vs the anti armor one, and it's a shame because I've been trying to get a good medic roll for months.
---
I just throw the ammo on the ground. That‚Äôs how much I hate the interface.
---
Bro just let me touch ur things
---
The other only option is to drop them, which destroys them but when you‚Äôre maxed out on the scrip limit and weight something‚Äôs gotta give.
---
PS4 pro here. I had the exact same problem. Boot the game, it tries to sign in, then crashes completely after some seconds.
---
Apparently it's some type of data corruption issue, but I don't know what causes it.
---
People have suggested wiping cache, save files from 76, rebuilding your database, booting a different game then booting 76. 
---
In my experience, none of these worked for me. Game would still immediately crash every time, completely unplayable. So had no choice but to uninstall/ reinstall. 
---
Game reinstalled just fine of course, but the subsequent 70+ gig updates are pretty brutal. In fact, I literally can't play the game anymore because I'm in a rural area with bandwidth/speed caps. Might be a month before I can log on again ü§∑üò©
---
Consoles dont get mods.
---
Riding Shotgun is probably my favorite event - and I definitely agree that the unique event rewards are a big part of the fun.
---
Congrats! Fingers crossed you get a nice shotgun roll soon. I've been trying to roll one for a couple of months and only just got one I wanted last night.
---
There is. It‚Äôs whatever ‚Äúback‚Äù is on your system. Hold it and you‚Äôre out.
---
Wait until the quest popup
---
Atom Shop fridges just need to have their spoil reduction bumped up to the same as Rank 3 Good With Salt.
---
Ah but it might someday so that's why it's locked just incase
---
I don‚Äôt announce mine... just pop it and everyone starts giving each other random thumbs up and gets all confused as to who opened it, fun to screw with people in a nice way.
---
Ya, I think I've created posts in regards to all 3. Lol
---
I think the trick for Bethesda is to implement new things that let players create their own fun. I like to think the 3 ideas I posted would do exactly that.
---
Thanks for the reply!! üëçüëç
---
I used my last three today. What else are you supposed to do while you wait for the tunnel to clear.
---
I read that we will be able to buy them after the legendary run is over, I how thats true. I love confetti mess lol
---
Well they better figure it out
---
I just think all of the pistol perks just just be added to the weapons. I've leveled multiple gunslingers and it's really crippling to have most of their cards in agility.i think their damage cards should be added to perception that would get them more usable.
---
A canning machine has been brought up several times over the past couple years. They have even responded saying they like the idea. I'm hoping one day we will see it.
---
 It's a little more variation outside of the usual nuking of the queen. Plus as people have mentioned, plenty of screws, you get a good amount of caps from doing the event and if you have a team with you that know what you're doing, it can run really smoothly. 
---
My favourite drop so far is the cursed harpoon gun. If you have the flechettes mod, it is a LOT of fun. I was playing around with it at Whitespring today. It's not the most viable weapon around but part of my endgame is testing out interesting/novelty weapon rolls (e.g. good effects on less viable weapons like the harpoon gun) so I'm enjoying it. I will probably bring it out for low stakes events just for the fun of it.
---
yes every single time I die. This bug should have never made it out of beta
---
Wow!! Gorgeous!
---
While I think it should be available to all owners of the base game as it's a gameplay feature, I'd buy it if they sold it outside of a subscription as a one time purchase. I don't want anything else in the subscription too badly.
---
Considering that they need agility, perception and luck to be at their best, I don‚Äôt think that switch would hurt them too much. Though a free character respec with that would be nice.
---
But I do have to ask - why have you leveled multiple gunslingers? I‚Äôm just curious, since my own experience with alts was that I wanted to try several different play styles.
---

---
You tried to private server transfer everything at once??! Thats a very bold move for so many reasons.
---
5% droprate as a reward from completing the event.
---
I would steal the hazmat suits off the Emmett mountain group. It wouldn't have any value anymore but I'd have 20 of them xD
---
Yea you can tame cats too
---
Is it that hard to just drop it after the event is done? I personally wouldn‚Äôt want to see them dropping things from the game when it comes to armor and weapons. Heavy ammo...fine, if it is that big of an issue for some players, but anything else....nope.
---
forgot to switch accounts? lmfao
---
Damn that sucks man. I'll try reinstalling but my wifi isn't too great either so wish me luck
---
Hell I doubt we're going to be see any of the cheat mods either. Or outfit mods.
---
Damn.sorry I usually try and have a anchor on the server but a crash still would of taken both out possibly
---
I am **sick** and **tired** of not being able to place **my balls** on the pool table, or **any** table I want for that matter! You're right: they have **ignored** our balls for far too long! Is it really **that much** to ask? Don't all players **deserve** to be able to display their **beautiful balls** for all to see?
---
Bethesda, hear this: our balls **must** be set **free!**
---
Nope only put a few things in the bag when the game crashed, lost EVERYTHING I had in my inventory
---
Its gonna be sold for gold bullion as a sink. Max 3 a day it looks like (PTS could change/be slightly different)
---
I was in my friends private server and she was near me, so I‚Äôm not sure why it happened but f*ck this game for that and so many other reasons
---
Final Word from Beckett's questline will do the trick=)
---
(aa/25/250. 50 cal MG, in case someone not aware)
---
"Yes! Yes! Let the anger flow through you!"
---
Another Sith *sigh*
---
It'd be so much easier if it was just like...
---
-Activate ammo spinner, brings up a menu **like** your stash (note: does not actually have any access to your stash).
---
-Dump all ammo in that you want to get rid of.
---
-Press button, play the spin animation, points are added. This is done so you have to confirm you want to get rid of whats in there.
---
No console tinkering until you are ready to *make* ammo. Suddenly it's a lot easier to hit a C.A.M.P., dump what you don't want, and keep playing. No more stopping for 10-20 minutes.
---
Well I'd hope you wouldn't stay in that long for them to turn black. Blue is a stage on the way to black ;)
---
I ate mine
---
I get that they will never likely raise the daily limits and in a sense I understand the necessary evil of the limits.
---
That being said we do need a change at least on the scrip side of things let us have scrip notes similar to treasure notes so we can scrip as much as we want so we can keep playing and not have clogged stashes or needs for mules. Shouldn't have to choose between dropping stuff or to log off for the day because of the limits.
---
Exactly
---
I‚Äôve got about ten on each of five characters, all from the roof of westek. One legitimate drop ever, I roll every time I hit the purveyor. 3200 hours in.....
---
Holding B on Xbox (and likely O on PS) does the same.
---
At least try the other remedies first, they're worth a shot. But yeah, reinstall is last resort.
---
Good luck, cause yeah it will literally take me days to finish downloading my update patches. Seriously it's like I got transported back into a dial up 56k modem wormhole ü§¶ü§Ø
---
Oh I know. When it first dropped I server hopped over and over to spawn it and run it. Love that event!
---
It‚Äôs a double edge sword for Bethesda. The challenging of workshops is a game mechanic and I think  that‚Äôs great. But the op builds (junkies and bloodied) ruin the pvp and over all mechanics of the game. They are the only ‚Äúend game‚Äù options everyone is shooting for, pun intended, for the most part. When you run around and one shot everything it kills the game. I feel these are the same people who say ‚Äúthere is no end game‚Äù and ‚Äúlacks content‚Äù. When you remove all challenge.. everything is easy. Where‚Äôs the fun.  You are talking about a very unpopular opting but I am with you. This game needs a massive rebalancing. But they‚Äôll loose support with the vocal fan base. So they are stuck between a hard place and a rock.
---
Haha so did I. So many runs. So many... just sold my last plan from it. Might need to go do it again xD
---
Mothsquad.
---
Weirdly, I've not had anything bad happen with either of those things. I've had abysmal pixellation with several piles all on top of each other and I've had horrible screachy noises from so many things happen at once, but that's it.
---
Thanks I found it
---
Thinking about doing the same... want to know the outcome of this.
---
Nice!
---
Of course, I assume it's Wall Decor or Floor Decor but I can't find it.
---
Probably 100% of the people who aren't paying for FO1st.
---
It was one of the last things I had yet to experience in the game. It was pretty exciting.
---
I love the title
---
Proposed, but they said they were coming out Sumer of 2019. So let‚Äôs hope!
---
For heavy guns pa is better
---
I'm more than aware of that lol, that's why I said I'm moving to a sneak build, so probably a fixer or a bow.
---
HAHAHA. Hopefully this one is legit.
---
I can‚Äôt remember where I got my one and only. It might of been rusty pick also. I‚Äôve gotten them from Wes tek also. But after 800 hours I gotta say it felt good to see that bad boy drop. I ate it tho.
---
I figured you were going for the famous sneak attack heavy weapon combo.
---
I think it might be a low priority item to reskin since it is a little difficult for non-endgame players to get.
---
It's a non-guaranteed drop from the Scorchbeast Queen, and doesn't drop again once you learn it, meaning you can't gain and trade extras unless you don't know it.
---
Yea that bundle kinda sucks for the price tbh, I just got the plushie
---
Lol I really hope that's not actually a thing XD however I do have an explosive harpoon gun so I'm one of the few who could pull it off lol.
---
Me too. I‚Äôve been looking forward to these for over a year. When they were serious about them earlier this summer (2020) there was a big let down. Maybe I put it on a pedestal but now I am l looking forward to the current content.
---
No, I'm just tired.  Imo heavy weapons are the meta
---
I bought it and i was thinking in a home to place but i found myself here in the Rabbit hole again.
---
Sounds like you don't know how to optimize your build for PA. SS armor is great for stealth, but PA with Emergency Protocols is far tankier. Stimpaks are much easier to use in PA as well. The only reason that I even got the SS armor set was for the jetpack.
---
I think they are more reliable ammo wise, but I think rifles have better damage output overall when it comes to bloodied builds
---
It happened to me last night at uranium fever too
---
Nope. That‚Äôs the problem. There is no consequence to dying and people still complain the game is too hard.
---
Not gonna lie I don't know anything about star wars lol so not sure I got the joke üòÖ.
---
My last camp had a pool table and a neat detail you can add is putting a few weapon racks on the wall with pool cues in them
---
Earl looks like ghost, a demonic entity which needs to be stopped. And sometimes, my commando cosplays as Egon Spengler. What am I supposed to do? 
---
Jokes aside, I have had more problems with Scorched Earth and explosive weapons (in terms of lag and frame drops and crashing) than with Teslas and Colossal Problem.
---
In fact, I have fought Earl three or four times alongside Tesla users and it was fine. My game only stutters when 12 wendigos are trying to run a train on my ass while I take poison damage. 
---
Is there any REAL technical info on why Teslas would be the issue?
---
 Nope. I have over 200 pies 3800 hours in.
---
It is a joke, so no worries. üòâ
---
The Sith are basically good guys who become evil in exchange for power.
---
It's too hot inside of the power armor mate.
---
Dang nice work! What are those walls?
---
Oh like I know the basics I'm just not super immersed into the universe, I just didn't know the context of the joke lol, and by the way we all know that JarJar Binks is the true sith emperor all hail him
---
&gt; But in reality, as bitter as it is to say i cant see this game lasting more than another 3-5 years max. 
---
Considering Fallout 5 will be out in 5 years. I'd say so lol.
---
Is it still bugged when the 5th gets opened, which negates all the buffs?
---
Cheers it worked, but sad i lost all my photos i had saved, i had photos from during the beta
---
When you said perk bonus I assume you meant special right?
---
More like laid claim to big balls, there‚Äôs not even proof they solo‚Äôd Earle...
---
Yeah, it is. 
---
I'm not saying to 'remove' these items from the game, I'm saying to STOP giving them to me after I reach a certain level. I've recently passed LVL 300 on one of my characters. After all of that time, I don't need sturdy, heavy, or combat armor pieces, and unless I'm carrying around a 90% Reduced Weight Missile Launcher that gives me a massage, pays me 1000 caps when I fire it, and provides other unmentionable benefits, I have ZERO USE for missles. I don't want to waste my time dropping the missles or scrapping the armor pieces for EVERY EVENT that I wind up doing, just exclude them from the reward pool of players above LVL 50, and replace that with actual useful rewards whether it's stimpacks, scrip, ammo points, purified water, food items, or whatever.
---
The problem *is* having to stop and drop *or scrap* these things.
---
It's tiresome to interact with the inventory interface for yet another pointless reason after you've done hundreds of these events and had to repeatedly drop or scrap the same things. 
---
By the time you reach the end of your reputation grind, you'll understand, because both of those factions have these items in their reward pools and you'll see how quickly your stash will fill up with armor pieces, missles, and mini nukes you do not have a use for.
---
I'm on XBox and the last time I did the event this happened I had no idea this was the cause. Another person upthread compared it to something like a rip in the space time continnum and that feels pretty accurate üòÇ my whole screen pixelated and it didn't stop for the rest of the fight. I thought I was losing my mind :)
---
Yep, good catch.
---
I think you want the benefits but not the look. Sorry. To be honest, it is a fair trade. 
---
Extra carry weight means a backpack. Flying with a jetpack means a jetpack. For everything else, there's Power Armor. 
---
You can totally play the game without the backpack (wear weight reduction perks and pieces of armor, or go Unyielding for 15 extra strength) and jump ridiculously high and far with marsupial and bird bones. 
---
It's like asking for a "hide hazmat" option.
---
Jesus I was about to say lol, imagine if that's how it worked unyeilding would-be broke as hell.

---
September 8th.
---
You are welcome. Thank you for helping me kill that big bad guy.
---
Nothing that adds new character or camp assets is likely because those assets wouldn't be transferable to anywhere else.
---
PvP between consenting players is fine. One shotting someone in the back for claiming a workshop is chickenshit. All Bethesda needs to do is remove the cap reward for killing someone if they‚Äôre in pacifist mode and make their junk inaccessible.
---
Any idea on cost as far as gold is concerned or are they still working on that?
---
sorry I didn't see this I don't need them I got a bunch already
---
It's 50% decrease in spoil rate. Have it. Had it in my CAMP. Scrapped it. Not worth the budget(takes quite a bit). Not even as good as Good With Salt.
---
It's so you can see/hear them from a distance. they tend to blend in with the environment especially when things are dark. Your eyes are good at catching movement so the flys make meat piles easier to see.
---
I'm liking the ultracite gatling laser since, unlike a gatling plasma, I can stand far away and still do a consistent accurate beam of damage.
---
Depending on character, I have a junkies, an explosive and a vampires one
---
It just works
---
Well today, I learned a lesson, 3 100+ fight Earle whilst the 5 sub level 50 who thought it was a good idea to drop in, and just hang out for the win instead of supporting us. Fuck those dudes/dudettes. Never again. Sorry I'm angry, I burned through all my 50 cal for that event
---
I dont know how I got mine to place first try properly over wallpaper.. I'm really afraid to move it now because of all the posts I've seen over the many weeks
---
I run a full set of unyielding with deep pockets and swap between two backpacks. High capacity and armored. Each legendary gear 3* has one type of weight reduction, junk, weapon, food and ammo. Which exceeds any power armor with calibrated shocks. With under armor plus one strength. Armored backpack for combat and high capacity for looting...
---
While they're adding the chainsaw, they should also add the drill. I want to drill things to death. Don't ask why.
---
As cattabliss said, am using a ts 50 limb ultracite gatling laser for it, also got a ts ffr gat plasma which comes pretty close to the same damage, but the laser lets you stand on a distance more
---
Same here. The biggest problem now is trying to find a  server that has an available silo.
---
I got to the end of one silo and it was still on cool down for an hour and a half but the missile silo holotape said it open. Looking at the map there was not 3 red circles, so annoying.
---
I'll raise the bet. The power fist should only be possible to use while in power armor.
---
The same with some heavy weapons. Like the Gatling Plasma.
---
Oh yeah and no new weapons as well lol.
---
How did you get those wooden beams?
---
I can't say for certain because I don't have it yet, but I believe it is having the same problem that the weapon display boards have.  If that is the case, I have been able to get them to work if I get really, really close to the wall when placing it.  Not sure it will help but hopefully it will :)
---
Also, I saw a post earlier where someone used the Slocombs Joe "have a nice day" sign and put the game board on it.  Was almost the perfect size/fit and looked pretty good.
---
I would gladly empty my cases of pies to be able to make preserves out of my favorite foods. Although since I'm really not in the mood to refarm ALL of my mutations because I know damn well that carnivore will be the last one to go, I guess it would have to be pickling meats or making jerky for me.
---
  
---
Oh! That's it! There's food dehydrators all over, make them an ingredient for a jerky machine where you turn meats into jerky with like a 10-25% decrease in usefulness but 100x the time to spoil.
---
Procedural generation dungeons so I can experience exciting new bugs
---
i just do it to get me some free pizza rolls
---
Oh. Huh. I didn't know it had to do with luck. That explains why I have 19 in various cases on my character that's usually walking around with 22 luck (15 base, +6 from scorchbeast liver with carnivore,+1 from a piece of gear)
---
Ahaa
---
You can put it on that Slocum Joe's sign they gave us a while back in the aton store for free.lools like a small billboard
---
Yay! So fun
---
Again on PTS so can change but 100 per I think (also using videos from YouTube because I'm on XB1)
---
I know a ton of players like and want pvp but I hate it. I‚Äôm just not good at pvp...I can predict how fallout creatures and the like are gonna behave but not actual people. Haha. I wish there was an option (like pvp server or pve). I have 1st so I can play with just friends but not everyone can or wants to pay for it. Idk.
---
Do you have a camp build video? I love this!
---
I'd be in the market for a Mistress of Mystery plushie to go with my Silver Shroud plushie :)
---
Example: for the picture challenge, Every time you take a picture of a creature it‚Äôll pop up 52/76
---
Yes
---
Google Angry Turtle's videos and look for the most recent one on Magic Weapons. All will be clear.
---
It goes faster if people go looking for the mirelurks before they are in the water.
---
My boy just a fellow 76 nerd. I hope he‚Äôs right
---
Haha omg wow
---
You can melt a bloodied build with a gamma gun or a fast fire plasma.but legacies for pvp is a tad unfair
---
It does look a bit like the Excavator PA. Would be funny if Hornwright did some sneaky deals in Mama Dolce's Basement
---
Its 2 separate game profiles.pc is one xbox is another not shared
---
Shhhh don't tell Bethesda! They fix all the bugs we love.
---
*Sad doggo noises*
---
Try looking at it from weird angles. My previous camp was quite small, and I'd been doing wonky positioning/replacing objects/putting things down in specific orders/etc that meant some things couldn't be highlighted. A trick that would occasionally work for me was to move around looking at it from strange places/angles that didn't seem to make any clear sense.   
---
Another weird trick that worked a very small amount of the time was to place another object in front of the unhighlightable thing, line up the cursor on the object where the unhighlightable thing is behind it, and delete the object. The object between us would be deleted, and the unhighlightable thing would be left magically highlighted. Again tho, those only worked a very small percentage of the time, but were my last ditch efforts before giving up and storing thingss until I could highlight the problem object and rebuild.
---
Last ditch effort would just be as Rapidwiz said. You might be able to move your camp someplace else, then move it back and pray the auto-created blueprint of your old camp would be place-able in the same spot
---
Aaaah got it thanks for the clarification
---
As great of an idea as this is, the person owning that vending machine also suffers since you're keeping them from potential sales not just by the jerk but by other actually nice players.
---
Update: Had to move camp, regrettably had to redo all the base. Thank you for your suggestions &gt;n&lt;
---
Love this post. Low level dies not mean useless
---
I threw one of the lighted posters (the ones that don't require a power line) and was able to attach it to the top of that so if you're doing a poster wall...
---
Pipe is life.
---
Here's an opportunity for them to give us one or more standard looks, and then sell different sets in the Atom Shop. But what I envision is e.g. a placeable hatch in your camp which acts as a door to an instance. Could be doors as well, but they'd have to be placed on something like a cliff side which leaves room for a large instance inside. Or it could be a totally T.A.R.D.I.S. thing, but that would be sort of lame
---
I've seen them for sale for 30K caps, so that's like saying it's for sale, but not really lol.
---
No luck myself getting one, whenever I see a vendor, I give it a try.
---
2700 hours, opened pipboy, found pie, shoved said pie down my pie hole.
---
Yea it's been bugged since day 1 man it really sucks. Create a ticket and ask a refund on atoms
---
Still having this issue on ps4
---
Then watch it die after less than 24 hours because it's level 1. :(
---
I feel cheated for you! Lol
---
Not bad!
---
Would be better if it was ultracite, but still nice
---
For real.   My camp is on a spawnpoint and I‚Äôm OCD about cooking all the meat I get.   I am soooo tired of tapping x for 20 minutes just to have 119 radtoad omelets that I‚Äôm never gonna eat while listening to my character scraping a ladle against the bottom of a pot
---
What is the end date?
---
The rumors didn't spread because you ate all the witnesses, you psycho
---
"legit"
---
No it was fixed.
---
Ohh nice. Thanks man!
---
Yes, but only if you do the tadpole challenges. I think theres enough to buy all the tadpole loot.
---
Good point!!
---
What, you need Bethesda to hold your hand for finding a group? Public Teams are all right, or you could send your resume to TYR and see if he gives a shit about your optimistic vibe
---
It‚Äôs happens here and there that‚Äôs how I fought most of my colossus before this event
---
Sounds like a fight my buddies and I took to the queen, one of our guys had a be cryo and kept her frozen on the ground for most of her 2 bars on her first drop, then she tried to take to the sky and while she tried to fly away she got wasted. If you play xb1 we might have been at that fight together. Lol
---
Pretty sure those doors in the mainframe room are just there for the sake of it as you have to go through the door blocked by a laser grid.
---
When you pick up tea in the world, it is in sealed mason jars and suddenly starts its rapid condition decline when you pick it up. If we could require junk items like mason jars or cans or time like we do for fermented alcohol, it would be great to be able to make shelf-stable teas, soups, and preserves. I use and sell steeped ash rose tea for the +2 Charisma boost and cranberry juice/relish for XP boost. If we could just add more functions to the cook station or fermenter, we won‚Äôt need another new workbench or (Todd forgive) another new currency.
---
Sounds like that group is the problem. Not the timer that actually makes the encounter a challenge.
---
I didn‚Äôt do it very often so far, but dying more than once or twice sounds like a bigger challenge, to be honest. Like other people said: change your perks or think about your positioning. If earl doesn‚Äôt die within 30 minutes, it might be not your fault. Dying often though, totally is.
---
Looks great with insurgent outfit actually
---
I'm actually really happy I'm not the only one whose never dropped a nuke, but oh man an I thankfull for the ones that do.
---
Maybe they fixed it because I just placed mine and it works fine. It‚Äôs on a full wallpapered wall.
---
My bloodied shotgun does over 400 damage per shot- over 500 with adrenaline. That's on the low side of a min-nuke per shot, and I still don't see much, if any, damage to Earle- which is why I've invested in heavy bloodied .50 gun. Soloing him must, imo, be linked to stealth, including a gun capable of dealing enough damage in 25 minutes.
---
I‚Äôd never run into it before even though I play both Xbox and PC, I thought it was fairly rare!
---
I'm sure we're all tired of crafting animations. They are BORING, Glitchesda.    
---
They have no excuse at this point. The Ammo Converter is still shit. It should be able to count how much of each ammo type and allow you to convert 1, 10, 50, 100, 1000 into whatever points for each.    
---
I'm where I only pick up for that character b/c going through makeing a choice, backing out on screen, repeat for 20 minutes is a waste of time.
---
They're acting like a dumbass for sure, but inapropriate name? What's inapropriate about that?
---
Realistically, you don't even need a machine. My wife and I can stuff in a big pot of boiling water on the stove.
---
They just need to added "canned" versions of each recipe that include a glass jar, more water, and maybe an extra piece of wood to account for the extra boiling time.
---
Since you mentioned Ultracite, does anti-armor effect Laser guns? Some people said they dont work on these types of weapons, and i have an AA Ultracite gatling laser
---
I like the idea of scrip notes
---
Mutation plans can help solve that problem lol
---
I definitely have better luck with a team of people I know, coordination does help a ton, if you can get a team together get 1 to 2 guys to handle the spawns while the rest focus on damage. With a couple of people whipping the spawn real quick, you can focus on Earle a lot longer.
---
Using my minigun I can mow down most of a wave of spawns in seconds the revert back to the boss, it's just a matter of seeing them before they see me. It also helps if you can keep your back against a wall, and try to keep your distance from other players so you don't step in their line of fire, or they don't step into yours.
---
That's very strange. I scrapped a lead pipe earlier and distinctly remember it giving steel and lead scrap. I wonder what was different.
---
Did u get owned by a shorgun build player? Or do u just not like using it?
---
They used to be worth something, until people realised there‚Äôs a static spawn at westtek you can keep hitting after (x) amount of hours
---
Fwiw, there's 10 cranberry plants at Aaronholt farm in the forest. No need to deal with the high level critters in the big.
---
It affects everyone except the user. If you're on ps4 I can show you how bad it makes it. 2 quad ffr clips and you will be at 4 fps if you look near where I was shooting.
---
My god, please. If we could do this, I‚Äôd actually be able to have some carry weight with my SS shielded undersuit.
---
Not to mention that the apocalypse is a great time for fashion. Owl mask + strangler/ultracite PA = Owlman.
---
It is I forgot what‚Äôs the chance to get one to spawn there
---
Thank you so much!  I have been going nuts for a week trying to figure out why I couldn't put the stein on the display case.  Because I was crafting it like a camp item, not building at the Tinkers Bench.  Apparently you can do both, but only one can be placed on the display.  Again, THANK YOU.
---
The chain effect is why. Its not loading properly and causes lag, and you can continue to stack it. Its not teslas in general its full auto teslas because then it gets stuck in a loop and any time you look near where they have chained multiple enemies it starts to lag
---
Here‚Äôs hoping they fix that bug. I may not use it during Earle, but it‚Äôs the only way I can deal with ghoul swarms on my PA rifleman build.
---
Serum plans, power armor mod plans, and encryptid recall key cards
---
The best QOL update! Tired of having to hit A over and over with the lag.
---
&gt;Did these games ever explore M.R.E.s?
---
The military was cash strapped by the time the bombs dropped, so they had canned dog food instead of MREs.
---
PS4, and I've only seen it done once. Pretty impressive to see something that large move in slow-motion then die so quickly.
---
I tried it all over my camp, only somewhat worked on a double sided wall.
---
Mama Mmrrgghh gave me a Vampires UGL with FFR the other day, and I had been wondering if that would be a decent toy to bring against Earle.
---
False. Each point of INT gives +2% XP.
---
It's blows my mind that anyone could be anywhere *near* max caps. I cannot fathom it.
---
I'm always broke, lol.
---
You can't scrap them, and if you try to drop them, you'll get a gigantic warning message on your screen saying they'll be destroyed and asking for another confirmation.
---
Believe me, pal. It looks horrid with the pristine miner uniform. The collar on the miner uniform doesn‚Äôt ride up enough to meet the already low neck bit of the helmet so there‚Äôs an awkward strip of skin showing.
---
&gt;personal terminal
---
You mean like the free one we already have that does fuck all at this point?
---
I totally forgot i had like 20, so i popped like 4 in ACP, got a bunch of hearts and thumbs up emotes, it feels nice :D
---
Nobody is actually giving woods.
---
It's Bethesda.
---
So I like the idea of an arcade cabinet, have a skin for each game.
---
We assign the tapes we have and they can be played by anyone entering our camp. 
---
High score is save on each of our machines for those that played on ours. 
---
Each play cost x coins assigned by the player.
---
If it resets at the same time every day it doesn't matter what shift you work or what time zone you're in. Do you complain about what time the score challenges reset?
---
YES YES YES.
---
I scrapped it when they ‚Äúimproved‚Äù it and haven‚Äôt used it since
---
Doesn‚Äôt the debris only fall from specific locations? Could you possibly just stand in certain spots to avoid death by debris?
---
Last year it was the opposite. Lol the world seemed ok but 76 was on fire!
---
Wood is ridiculously easy to get.  Arguably easier than steel.
---
The damage numbers won't be anything to write home about but what is great with vffr is ability to not be affected by hot rocks falling on you as much, since your hp stays full. 
---
With vampires I get to stand and fire from one place a lot more often. If wendigos come I can run away while continually shooting earle to mitigate any damage I get, without really watching where I step.
---
I've bought every plan for sale from all robot vendors by now and some of the serums. Once I get the last serum I'll probably save up and buy a 30,000 cap "You've been insulted!" note that some low level put up as a joke.
---
Well....
---
1 - I am level 297 
---
2 - I have reached ally with both factions
---
I do not find it that hard to click on my pipboy and scroll over to ammo and drop some. I do it frequently with missiles, 40mm, 50cal, etc. 
---
Perhaps they could just get rid of them and not replace them with anything. That would be fair if people do not want to be bothered to click a few buttons. 
---
Besides....I don‚Äôt use heavy guns or ammo or guns really at all. So maybe they should just stop all ammo from dropping from events. I think that would be fair.
---
PEP-O-RONI RRRRROOOOLLLLLLLLLL
---
It's almost a shame, because I kinda like the idea of a quest that reveals that there's some guy sitting in his basement, making all the plushies and outfits after he went mad from seeing all the mutated creatures.
---
Well you could just stand in one place only Bloodied builds like me have to be moving
---
Can never be too careful !
---
I go to random camps and spend up to 10,000c
---
Seeing as they cant even animate 2h weapons in PA, fist weapons happening is a long ways off
---
I had to take my vendors down.im at 28k and that's because I hop camps hoping to find something worth buying.some one had a 3star bloodied radium for 10k...worth it?probably not but bought it anyways.a day later put my vendors back on and  some one tries to empty me out.30kcaps and the guy kept buying.
---
Precisely
---
Cosmetics like that wont give materials when you scrap them, but fear not, as long as you complete the "Scrap 76 outfits" challenge first it will unlock a "Scrap 76 hats" challenge. Those fedoras are worth 40 atoms.
---
It's a 10% chance spawn IIRC.
---
Ive thought of something similar recently, like ‚Äúhow effed up is it that i take solace and find relaxation in a dieing wasteland‚Äù
---
I keep seeing crap on the ground at SBQ from kills that weren't looted or whatever.  Is it possible to kill something on the pool table, store an item on it and then have the item drop when the corpse poofs?  I assume not, but I can't be bothered to try.
---
Wow.i been playing for a year and a half and recently hit 400 hours..wife wasnt too happy with that time I've wasted.lol still login every night at least a hour
---
I‚Äôve only got 2 serum recipes left to buy, idk wtf I‚Äôm gonna do after that
---
Not everyone can play at the same time every day. During the week I'm lucky if I can get in for an hour or two in the evening before bed. On weekends I have to get some time in early in the day before my wife and I start running errands or working on projects.
---
They just need to make everything in the game reset at the same time as the dailies so it's on a consistent 24hr timer.
---
We should have a level 1000 cat. And make it 100x tankier than Earle. With a legendary cat scratch.
---
Colossal problem? = CP?
---
I want Ada back or (synth) Curie.
---
Plasma doesn't seem to do it but it does other glitches.
---
If you use plasma weapons you must loot your goo piles fully or you'll be hated
---
If you have a decent pc its good.but xbox is safer no real hacked weapons on it.but on PC you Can find the craziest guns.a sniper rifle with a cryolater barrel followed by a minigun barrel after that...sure why not
---
My mirelurk hunter likes to be petted too.
---
I believe this has been an ongoing problem since the last major update.  The good news is people have figured out a work around.  You'll just need to search the post history. Good luck out there
---
I havent tried this but would like to know as well.
---
That legendary cat scratch should have the effect Cat Scratch Fever
---
Ya, don't take workshops if you don't want pvp, there's much better places for resources
---
It means something completely different to the rest of Internet browsing community
---
I suppose it's a little different for a player camp vendor, if you want to ensure snagging something before someone else for example. 
---
But at least for me I'm a vendor window shopper, it's kinda like real life thrift shopping. I'm quite surprised how much time I spend just hopping camps on the map checking stuff out
---
Reduces energy damage by 99%, ballistic damage by 95%, explosive damage by 100% and all melee damage you deal to your target is reflected back onto you. If you even survive the 50k damage. See how you Bloodied melee builds and legacy yielders like it now, huh?
---
*shifts guiltily*
---
Congrats! I accidentally ate mine. Almost got another, but the game glitches out and didn't put it in the container. I'm not smart nor lucky here
---
I much preferred pick pocketing mines and grenades into their inventory instead. Fun times, especially with the super mutant.
---
once a week I spend 6K at the wayward to get the 300 gold bullion and I'll go to a low level players camp and pretty much buy them out then give it all back.
---
Read the post. I didnt want resources. I needed to build for score and my camp is full.
---
For real, *ring of fire starts playing
---
Yeah, I get that.
---
The data miners disproved that.
---
Yep they would need to redisign ALL equipable gear to fit super mutants if they added them which is what i dont think they ever will.
---
I have a pic of my character in the NW area before it starts, there's a table with the pie on it, I made it look as if he's questioning if he should eat it or keep it lol
---
If you don't want to die and lose your junk you should alt f4 as fast as possible. You're logged out of the world instantly and there's nothing the other person can do about it. I've done think numerous times at trap camps and have never once lost junk.
---
It will be 40mm grenades missles and technical data that you can't turn in
---
I didnt have any junk to lose. Wondering if running out of the workshop zone is an option
---
Some snowflakes don‚Äôt like that H.P. Lovecraft had intolerant views on immigrants and certain races, but instead of simply ignoring his personal views (which he recanted later in life) they want to try to ‚Äúcancel‚Äù him.
---
Im ok with the abilty for people to play as ghouls if its cosmetic only.
---
Same here got 4 pieces of unyielding except one leg.within 40 rolls that last leg has been 40 rolls and finally got it but its 2 star.others always 3 or or duplicates with less stars
---
I'm pretty sure it's a guaranteed drop from your first SBQ.
---
Yes it's too coincidental. I think we're on to something
---
Yes I do, and I don‚Äôt care he‚Äôs racist. I just like Top Gear and his books.
---
I probably would have never started playing 76 if it wasn‚Äôt for Covid. Now I‚Äôm about 400hrs in
---
Had a lv 7 join in one yesterday. The event was otherwise a full team of lv 150+, so it was gonna be  a cakewalk anyway.
---
Lv 7 guy got a few looks and was shot a few times while we were waiting, so he did the sorry emote, but to my surprise (even though I kinda figured he's an experienced player) he stayed alive pretty much during the whole fight.
---
I could see him for most of it, shooting what I think was an auto .38 with thousands of rounds of ammo, not dying. 
---
He ended up gaining 2 lvs and looked like he got loot from Earle as well, since he certainly spent a good amount of time digging through the corpse.
---
For some weird reason I‚Äôve gotten the PPP 4 times at the Pleasant Valley Ski Resort Port-A-Diner and no other location. I‚Äôm approximately 1500 hours in. So moist. So delicious.
---
Lol I honestly thought it was the crafting table I was using .never used a diffrent one because the ones I crafted at camp were always trash.
---
At the very least we should be able to pickle things.
---
Yes up 2 a point you can shoot people outside if they were in it before
---
Ugh. Ok. Thanks
---
Laser ash piles aren‚Äôt doing that though - it‚Äôs all Tesla ash piles.
---
Mainly bullion, encryptid cards, and random weapons and plans from other people‚Äôs camps
---
Fun way of killing people
---
Very chonky bloated glowing one in a zorbo outfit?
---
You are being conditioned to join us, member...
---
Meat smoker would be cool too. Not quite as effective as canning but they could definitely add some really cool smoker grills for our camps
---
I'm paying for first and I still think it should be permanent, the rest of 1st's features are plenty for the price, or at least passable
---
Its a static spawn i sell them all the time.
---
Where do you get mods for it?
---
i can get behind this... say it‚Äôs how the mechanist was in fo3 or even fo4... just an old irradiated ‚Äúenthusiast‚Äù
---
Curious- where did you end up when you logged back in?

There's most of mine! Some of the details have changed but they layouts still the same

Also go check out r/fallout76settlements for lots of great builds!

And the SS are okay?
---
Child porn is I assume what he meant
---
I think it's easier to solo a silo. Pretty sure most events/silo scale from what I've noticed. Whenever I do either solo, it's usually me picking off a small handfull of enemies every now and then followed by me watching the blood dry. Add even another person and it always feels like we're getting mobbed lol
---
I hate when wearing powerarmour \*lowers\* how much weight I can carry.

It's kinda Darth Vader-y, so I wanted to find something ominous and long. Closest I got is the Ranger Outfit from Fallout1st.

Xbox here - yes, it really is *that* unplayable. I don‚Äôt fully understand why, but I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs where multiple enemies have been hit at any one time by a Tesla rifle. My frame rate has dropped so hard, it was literally seconds per frame.
---
And no, not as far as I know. I use a BE laser rifle for particularly hard targets to kill in PvP and no issues reported even after creation of ash piles. 
---
So I‚Äôve taken to killing Tesla users until they either stop using it or piss off.
---
The game really needs a paid dlc, something that Bethesda will probably put work into to that wouldn't be fetch quests or repetitive bullshit. Hopefully something like Fallout 4's dlcs. The free content updates we get just aren't that amazing and never hold you for very long unlike the other game's stories.
---
The place I was at before fast traveling; Lady Janet's Soft Serve
---
üëç
---
Theres a sub for this but you already know that.
---
I made this post about 3seconds after scrapping a lead pipe that dropped from a scorched and I only made this post because it gave 1 steel scrap &amp; 1 concrete scrap. Maybe the crafted version and dropped version are different.
---
That is good advice; roll one and try another server until you can at least confirm the first legendary effect. I still am a bit skeptical, but the theory of predetermined rolls per server continues to pop up. Respect for sharing the data.
---
Just go to west tek theres one on the roof
---
Ahhh yes, a man of culture!
---
Save it to one drive on xbox
---
The winning it is part of the joy.
---
I feel you and it sucks.  My last 3 attempts have been cursed with 1 disconnect after earl death, 1 before, and 1 respawn glitch.
---
If they got got or not, the gauss shotty messes up basic gameplay in NW. It's buggy as hell
---
Yeah, I thought so too. I wish I would have took a screen shot because the lead pipe I got from a scorched definitely said 1 steel scrap &amp; 1 concrete scrap.. I must have got some Pipe fumes
---
I reset my characters out of boredom besides my mains for rifles and strength weapons. Just trying to figure out the best ways to unlock pistols potential. Doing it while leveling up just gives me the feel for scaling without needing multiple levels of perk cards and before I have the potential to blow things away.
---
A little off-topic, but is SS armor worth it? I already have a nice set of UNY armor that's not SS, including two pieces with poison resist (which seems to make me immune to poison attacks, not sure if that's a bug or what). I'm just wondering if it's worth going through the pain and agony of getting 5 good rolls all over again.
---
I might try with the SS chest piece only, at least then I can wear a jetpack.
---
Could rifles please have A weight reduction perk.
---
Yeah one of my favorite parts of the game
---
How many of those hours were watching an animation? Its a waste of game time.
---
Break his kneecaps
---
I have to admit it was nice seeing all the newbies hit once wastlanders came through around the same time.76 seemed alive.
---
Whats wrong with that?  It's like any MMO, just find one that is relaxed and open to anybody.
---
If you want to join a "hardcore/world first" tier guild you need to be prepared to meet their demands in term of skill/availability, and most importantly mentality. 
---
Which you clearly do not seem to have or you wouldn't even complain about it in the first place. 
---
Unless all you wanted was to get into such guilds to be carried, it's literally not gonna be affecting you.
---
I don't doubt it. Like sugar bombs having a version with and without rads (and only the one with rads working for cooking) there's some pretty weird variations of stuff in this game sometimes.
---
Oh you smooth talker you.... what did you say to convince her to give you one of the 'real' gifts as opposed to those in the discount bin?
---
A good gamma gun is helpful in this situation.  I don‚Äôt initiate PVP, but carry a quad for some occasional fun.
---
Looks a tad spooky
---
Oh lol.
---
And please let me used gauntlets and power fists etc. Right now the only benefit of PA is the rad resist. but with full SS, radshield, and lots of radaway I can Barely scrape by. The legendary rad resist will make all PA not only useless, but a hinderance to me.
---
A scorched mothman is being controlled by a hive mind right?
---
Sure, give one of the few benefits away to non PA users. Sarcasm.
---
I'm pretty sure that's 63, at least, if memory serves from other times people've run into that bug.  
---
96 has more visible ice and 94 is thick with plant life, so I'm pretty sure others determined it's 63.
---
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
---
Allow mass crafting in general
---
Ok rude. Second, not everyone can afford private servers. Third, workshop budgets are bigger than camps so some people just want to build. Fourth, some of us still want the building score but have maxed our camps. Finally, I am grown up. I just dont appreciate people going above and beyond killing in pvp. Pvp in a workshop is fine. No need to get nasty afterwards
---
Or...... maybe fallout 76 is in fact a training video for facing the wasteland at the end of 2020....
---
The year isn't over, you know.
---
They should add the chainsaw plan craftable at level 50 into the Halloween event this year and make it a legendary just like the Tenderizer. I've been missing the chainsaw in my life since they removed over repair buffs on melee weapons and I miss the weapon greatly.
---
Can we get Stealth PA?
---
I got a quad faster fire rate once..so excited but good lord probably do more damage with plain fists
---
me too. genuinely interested in playing this dumpster fire of a game and everytime i try to launch i never get queued for a server or i make it to the main menu and never see the play button.
---
I still have nightmares of those airdrop containers falling out of nowhere everywhere I went
---
96 was suppose to be the origin of the Cryolator lol
---
Maybe it wasnt the guy who wrote, but the guy Im talking about ingame had not a nice name. I just assumed it was the same guy here the way he spoke
---
This happens with my tesla. After logging in/changing worlds, it seems to think that it takes fusion cores, rather than fusion cells, as the ammo it shows in the lower right corner is how many cores I have. When I try to fire, it says "missing required ammo" as well. I wonder if this happens with any other guns? Truly bizarre
---
just look up how to glitch through them, it's actually super easy
---
Did my first ACP run with two friends earlier. One of the other guys was using a tesla and managed to crash the game for both my friends. It was hard to tell if anyone else had crashed but I'm amazed that mine didn't seeing my ps4 sometimes sounds like it's about to blow up. Though, I did spend most of the event with my framerate in the single digits so I couldn't do much of anything anyway.
---
I somehow read your comment as "94" not "96" and thusly I'm editing this post to fix my error. Sorry about that.  
---
It's at least the likely explanation of the Cryolator's existence in Appalachia. We'll find out more once it shows up in the Ops.
---
Can't believe someone actually posted this. Had a good laugh
---
I am glad you are doing well. Stay safe out there!
---
Also, if you see the Mothman, tell him he still owes me that 50 caps. I am not going to forget about that debt...
---
Was staking out a new site today. Am thinking a pumpkin/scary house for the fall
---
Can I ask you something? How many items do you carry on your inventory? How many free space do you have on your console? I'm asking cause I wanna know what's causing frame drops on a system that's supposed to run the game with no problem
---
Yeah it is fun when it works right, and obviously super fast. When we did it, she probably wouldn't have had the chance to take off, but s mirelurk ki g popped out from under the queen and came after me mid way through the time she was on the ground and I had to fall back. By the time I got back to the fight she was taking off and only had a tiny bit of life left. So we just kinda followed her and kept shooting. Lol
---
This was only a week or two ago, I think right before Earle dropped in to change the course of most incoming nukes.
---
Yes SS is worth it. I have a full set of matching Marine with Sneak and +1 strength and still prefer the SS. It's just a real pain to roll all 5 pieces, then re-roll to get better pieces.
---
I fought one in the pink forest area in the bog. Other ppl have said sometimes they spawn with the queen? Not sure about that though.
---
I agree totally.
---
I say that too we have too many months of 2020 left.....
---
I told her that Bethesda would fix all the horrible bugs in the game
---
They have a 10% chance to spawn when the queen is nuked, as well as other areas of the map - one being the freak show and I don‚Äôt remember the other spots.
---
Also if you use a Tesla rifle during events just to tag everything, you‚Äôre a dick
---
Interesting... My camp ain't far from there.... Might have to check that area out.
---
It's like the soul trying to find equilibrium with the outside world....
---
Saw a guy naked with a metal mothman helmet follow a level 15 only moved when he was turned away
---
Yup, the sad truth is that the players who look for PvP in 76 are tryhards looking for a fight they can win; not a fight that is even. Every time I've been attacked it's always by someone decked out in full legendary sets that give PvP advantages, using chems that allow them to see stealth and wielding hacked or legacy weapons. I've yet to see a single situation in person where it is just for funsies instead of someone being a sweaty tryhard trying to get the upperhand since they are scared of playing NW. I know one single PvPer Youtuber who does it for funsies but the rest of them are toxic as the fallout in the Glowing Sea.
---
Could we get a Chinese stealth suit mod and unyielding pa peices?
---
So if you die at the end, AND reload back to the trailer inside the mine where we jump down, head left, if the jump spot is caved in, and ypu can run back the way we run out to get back to Earls body to loot. This only works if you did not spawn outside.  But, it's something.
---
Worth it for jetpack and good stats but is it worth trying to roll all 5 god roll pieces? Absolutely not. Just get a good chest piece and waste your modules on weapons
---
Tesla rifle is most likely the cause, do not use Tesla rifle in the event
---
Thank you for that! Unfortunately I‚Äôve spawned outside every time, but this is still good to know üëçüèº
---
To the game!! I would start my day with animal crossing while I drank my coffee then fallout
---
Its in a train yard and i shoved all my crafting stations(except power armor) into the caboose camp preset
---
Let me put it this way: I have several Unyielding sets. My favourite is my Marine set, because it looks good and is balanced with its rad resistance. 
---
My SS set is two legs and chest Unyielding, and bolstering left arm + hard to detect right arm, + other good effects, like poison and such. Everything buttressed. 
---
Difference is NOT huge. Rad resistance is crazy high (like 500 with my leaded backpack). But not enough for a rad zone. During events, some friends of mine go full SS and die often. Diminishing returns in armor say that what kills you at 300DR kills you at 500. Dodgy makes a difference, to give an example of noticeable tankiness. 
---
My SS set is stashed. If I ever get the full set, well, cool.
---
I am guessing it can make a big difference if you min max at PvP, because it gives you a mathematical edge. But that's it.
---
I‚Äôve killed about 70 people for not putting away their Tesla rifle despite being told numerous times it‚Äôs making everyone else lag like fuck and quit out.
---
I have been fighting COVID since November 2018.
---
I went in with my bow, a guass shotgun, a double barrel shotgun as my main weapons, with several other weapons and pieces of armor I will sell or scrap,  probably about 50 aid items in total, my misc tab with keys and stuff filled up, not holotapes, about 7 plans, no junk, 1 mod, and a tiny bit of every type of ammo, except shotgun shells since that's my build, I had about 300 shells. So about 194 out of my 280 inventory limit. I wore power armor. Stash is about 500 out of 800 but I'm not sure if that impacts anything.
---
Dont get me started on boiled water.
---
The jetpack is awesome. With unyielding and AP regen my mobility is amazing. And, it doesn't drain my fusion cores. And I level up really fast. The helmet has a bright light on it, which is cool. I don't like the green Pip Boy light, never have. The helmet is super expensive for some reason. The shielded SS under armor is pretty good. With the Buttressed mod, the SS set is the best armor in the game. Regular armor anyway. PA is still better in almost every way.
---
You can get the Stealth Boy torso mod on X-01 and T-65.
---
There should be no time at all.let players grind however long they want.
---
I didnt. I'm not sure if someone else did.
---
How could you build that huge camp? I just build 3 posters and my budget is full. And I don't have a lot of stuff. ü§î
---
Honest question, what do you spend your bullion on? I have so much and I haven't decided how to spend it because I like the stealth suit.
---
From looking around high end houses. They seem to buy all the plans for mounted enemies and post them all over their gaudy ugly houses.
---
I actually like this, let Earle be an end game boss, and everyone else fight the SBQ, everyone wins in that scenario.
---
If you want a full, decent set then duping modules is the only way to get it.
---
No turrets, not many lights, not many wires or conduits
---
You can get them for free on top of west tek.i have 100.but i know how you feel.it has been an icon in fallout games.but now we can get as many as you want.
---
Not sure I understand...you're leaving a game that you enjoy still because...
---
I use a Bloodied Explosive 50 Cal and that things does some fawkin work!
---
I have never used a Gatling Plasma until I am able to get one I want. And I have never used a Gatling Laser since thats just basically a discount Gatling Plasma, I have no use for it.
---
But the 50 cal hammers everything.
---
They have a 10% chance to spawn at any of the vs. random encounter spots (where two types of mobs fight each other) when they are nuked. There are two locations where you can get two spots in a nuke zone giving you more chances to get them, one is by the freak show and the other is near Hornwright. The Colossus spawn is different than Earle who is a unique wendigo Colossus boss.
---
TSE GATLING GUN.
---
Not even a little bit.
---
Even if one is using Tesla rifle the frame rate will drop significantly
---
#PATIENTZERO
---
Why kill them with explosive bait? I empty a dozen fusion cells into the back of their heads.
---
They probably can't.
---
There was a bug a long time back where stats for PA didn't apply *unless* you stripped down yourself before entering - Bethesda's fix for the bug was to automagically strip you down on entering.
---
50 cal machine gun
---
Light machine gun
---
Gatling plasma
---
Guass minigun
---
A lot depends on your legendary rolls too. I have a TS LMG that I love but it rubber bands because fire rate is too fast.
---
I disagree. I have completed two decent sets now no dupes
---
As a Bloodied build I hate you.
---
Yea In the forest are if you have the nuke over it
---
Earl is the guaranteed spawn. They can spawn in nuke zones just very rare i believe. Location of nuke probably matters too.

I love building camps. But I havent built one in over a year. I love this one so much I don't want move and start a new. And I only have one character.
---
Its a shame we can only build one camp per character.
---
My rifle is heavier than a heavy gun.
---
When I got rid of healing factor mutation the bug was reduced in frequency by 90%
---
I have powered armor it causes me no issues.
---
400? Rookie numbers son, get to 1000 and then I‚Äôll be impressed.
---
Well i see them shooting at it.i don't want to steal the glory.i can kill almost anything with 1 to 3 shots very very easily.so i cripple the beast and let them beat the crap out of it.still takes them 3 mins.lol.
---
Honestly at the rate 2020 has been I‚Äôd take living in Appalachia over the real world. At least they have an inoculation for their plague.
---
Have him be a legendary Flatwoods monster.
---
Platform?
---
I usually average 1 every 3rd try. It has been a minute since I have tried it. Throw it in the vendor for 25k caps. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
BE Plasma is my favorite.
---
Bugs that have existed since beta are still present. They need to be addressed before anything new is added.
---
You need to finish the Wastelanders quest and get max reputation with the Settlers to get the Guass Shotgun.
---
I try and find as much 50 cal ammo for 1 cap per as possible
---
You have to finish the Heist quest, and then get your Settler Rep to its maximum, which will require you to the daily many, many times. You can also add to Settler rep slightly by doing the Raider loyalty daily, but use 8 Charisma to send the ex-raider to Foundation. 
---
All in all, it will probably take you a month or so of rep to get there.
---
I was just thinking about your pre-hurricane post this afternoon! I meant to look it up so I could follow up with you but I got caught up in something else and forgot. I'm glad you made it through okay and are doing well!
---
An unbroken stove would also be a welcome addition.
---
There is alot of new low level players that have no idea a level 80 sheepsquatch will squish them with 2 hits.so they go full rambo and get smoked.this on xbox.its free through game pass.i also drop all the loot for them because i just don't need it.im really there for the gold notes.the other crap is junk to me.i make all my own 3 star weps and armor.so the only thing i grind for is notes.i throw 3 star legeandary items away.my stuff is much much better.im 100% self sufficient.
---
For me, just waiting like 5 seconds before clicking the final fast travel button does the trick. Still fucks me sometimes but not nearly as much as if I was smashing that X or A button.
---
I feel like the robot vendor in harpers ferry had the plan for the rifle, not sure about the mod. Might be able to find it at the brotherhood robot in watoga.
---
I'll buy up ammo so I don't have to craft (except for ultracite cores bc no one seems to carry those).
---
Earle just needs to give repair kits
---
Thanks man. So inventory definitely wasn't an issue
---
I like the idea but it also reminded me of this lol

---
God i wish they would just give us a fucking spiral staircase finally.
---
I agree
---
It has one (or several): The Quack outfit.
---
Gatling Plasma are BRUTAL if you can get a decent RNG, lots of ammo/easy to make, fire crazy fast, do decent damage, and are fairly accurate. Love them lol
---
Same with backpacks. Makes no sense to then be overencumbered when entering power armour. What the fuck reasoning is there behind stripping you of everything when entering? Jesus. Out of all the things they could focus on.
---
I too have noticed a predisposition to similar rolls within a short time period. I assumed it was a shitty pseudorandom seed that wasn't changed/resampled for an excessive period of time. Good work, man!
---
Im sure it will be available for gold soon.they cannot come up with a good event.i finally did it.its lame.as with most of their events.why the hell limit players to only 8 on an event that is more difficult than the sbq?
---
I was hoping that 76 would be one that avoided that. But yes, you're right. I don't let a game turn into a job (keep tight schedules, learn my role etc.)
---
Yeah now all those are over and Earle is boring now.
---
Nice place you got there.
---
It‚Äôs absolutely, unequivocally, 100%, f***ing absurd, that we can‚Äôt wear the f***ing underarmors in power armor. What on f***ing earth has every god d*** BoS soldier been wearing in their f***ing power armor, in every single f***ing Fallout game?!?! A f***ing BoS underarmor!!!!!
---
Edit: the way this turned out because of all the asterisks, is quite entertaining.
---
Tank killer works on pistols? Has that always been a thing?
---
oh damn it..................I feel really bored on my combat shotgun, and still can't get any explosive shotgun yet.
---
Explosive kills you so easily though
---
It's funny because I was just in the event with 2 level 400+ and they just stood there the whole event not doing anything. Mongs. Lower levels have much more enthusiasm.
---
They showed the reclaimed deep miner outfit?? Picture or video?
---
Bro i was the same.its actually super easy to do it solo.you can use the stealth armor through most of it.then at the end only 8 robots come out where you actually press the button.i can do it really quick now.hell i think you can use your power armor to glitch through the wall still.
---
I have a blm sign on the side of my camp, some guy came over and started shooting it and doing the puke emote. Hope he steps on a lego...
---
I sold 2 for 300 caps each yesterday.i still have 14.lol
---
Got mine from Grahm or however you spell his name
---
I had someon offer me 1000 caps for 3.but i usually sell them for 100.but they are hard to come by now so 300 each.
---
Holy crap!thats alot of nuka cola.
---
It doesn't let you sneak like normal armor. Two or three rounds and you are exposed. Oh and we need silencer for heavy weapons too
---
Does the 42% only occur if it‚Äôs matching PA?   I have some mixed and match PA and it doesn‚Äôt seem to work so well.
---
Great job!  I guess my gang will have to try our best to beat your time.
---
Nope.
---
Every time I've opened one, at least two or three others have opened some as well. It's pretty awesome.
---
I got the plan from a player vendor for 2000 caps over a week ago.    
---
IDK what it goes for and I'm not into the economics of it like mad person.    
---
I did get a 2 Star one after doing that repeatable quest from the Astronaut chick. I was surprised that I'd get anything of value like gear or a weapon from her.    
---
No luck from the piss poor random drops from the Mole Miner thing.
---
Sure does, fire in spurts if you're in a situation where enemies are far too close. If you use explosive weapons, you will most likely die a lot from your own trigger finger. But you still hose things down more efficiently than killing yourself. The pros outweigh the cons.
---
If you don't like explosive, I would go with Bloodied and Faster Fire Rate, but I prefer explosive because I like when things go boom.
---
I'm working on the T-65 power armor with jetpack and calibrated shocks.
---
You could simply get a lot of Abraxo, a plunger, some purified water, and a broom and clean it yourself. Stop being lazy people.
---
50 cal or gat plasma, depending on how you feel about windups. Gatling gun has the best ammo economy by far. But i love my bloodied plasma caster too
---
Tyvm.. it was a hell of a ride. Made out way better than most
---
Just in case, I put a ton of stuff in my stash and tried the event again, no lag this time. Another guy said that the Tesla rifle causes it, so maybe that's it.
---
Same. I hate the stairs we have
---
Well, I did try the event again and no lag issues, so maybe it right. I think I jumped to conclusions, but bethesda seriously needs to fix that.
---
Stash increase or Unlimited scrap stash for everyone, not locked behind a trashy subscription.
---
I think the gators ate him sry lol I'll send you what was left. Thanks+
---
Yeah noticed those ash piles created from teslas cause big lags ACP or not
---
I don't have 1st, so I tend to carry a lot of junk.  I just hate dying and would prefer slightly less damage to dying all the time.
---
I want to find the neon Open and Letter plans. I've been looking for months.
---
For some reason they just don't fix bugs despite knowing about them for months or even years lol
---
Source?
---
Ty! That's good to know.
---
Boy do I have some good news for you
---
I do use that mod but it doesn't affect the Tesla problem.
---
I love the mood for making ash like easier to loot, but something about the Tesla Rifle is currently horribly bugged. I could have dozens and dozens of ash piles created by laser weapons on screen and it won't affect me at all, but as soon as someone's using a Tesla Rifle my FPS goes in the toilet.
---
Try placing a custom marker if it fails, works a treat.
---
From the event or from him?
---
Considering we can build fusion reactors, tactical mini-nukes, and complex laser weapons, this doesnt seem unreasonable...
---
Same issue...
---
I like news.
---
And i did that as well. Same thing.
---
Unlike rifles there is no "best" heavy gun. They all do things a bit differently and are all great
---
50cal, great all arounder
---
Gattling, great dmg and ammo efficient 
---
Lmg, huge dps, small mag, expensive ammo
---
Mini, looks bad ass, wind up, alright damage
---
Flamers, hungry bastards, awesome room clearers
---
Harpoons, best shotguns in the game
---
Gat lasers, good dmg, 1k round clip with power user, very accurate
---
It'll end and many won't finish.    
---
I finished at least a week ago and the rewards are bland for the most part. For me, cosmetic items are largely crap. I really only care about my CAMP and can appreciate others if they are done well. They don't have to have every item unlocked or built to make it a good one.    
---
If you don't finish no big deal. Once S2 info and dates are released then we can focus on that.
---
It‚Äôs... *wipes tear from eye* beautiful.

That's where I found it..Harpers ferry vendor bot

---
On Xbox save them to OneDrive or Xbox live
---
I don't think they are from a set place. Best way to get it honestly is to either scrap a bunch of them or to get someone to mod it for you until you eventually learn it yourself. If you're on Xbox hit me up I think I know all or most the mods I will mod it out for you no charge.
---
I would suggest getting just one month of 1st, collect an insanely ridiculous amount of junk within that month and then get rid of 1st before it auto renews.
---
Just collect everything, store everything, if you think you've collected enough, keep collecting more and you'll never have to worry about junk again.
---
I haven't had 1st in quite a while and I'm still solid on all my junk except for lead, which I never really collected in bunches in the first places.
---
That will give a stupid amount of room in your Stash for weapons and gear you want. Try different things out for a Bloodied build.
---
Totally agree. I've even had a number of times where none of the turrets worked.
---
backpacks also
---
I hate hunting them down so I always buy them
---
Charisma affects event XP, Intelligence affects XP from killing creatures.
---
You can fix that by going into settings. I think it‚Äôs gameplay? And there‚Äôs a toggle to activate missions/quests automatically.
---
This happened to me awhile back and I hated having to open my pip-boy every time.
---
I've only been dropping nukes on my private server. I can solo the SBQ and ACP so why take a chance on a public.
---
The mothman cult seem to still be figuring out how to worship the thing correctly. It's possible that they've accidentally mixed mothman and interloper worship, which is why we get some bizarre overlap between the two.
---
Or maybe the mothman is just a normal creature and the interloper is tricking the cultists (while they think they're worshipping the mothman).
---
Or maybe the leaders worship the interloper and are conning the other cultists. 
---
Or maybe the mothman is a legit deity/cryptid, possibly warning them that they're unintentionally summoning the interloper or some other eldrich horror, arriving every time they get closer to summoning the interloper to warn them to stop, but the cultists misinterpret is as gaining favour from the mothman. 
---
There's so many possibilities. I love a good mystery.
---
You have skill points in Intelligence for those languages, good for you! Now invest some points into wisdom, so you know how to better choose and use those words.
---
Well, I disagree. It's not that it's 'hard' to do this thing. It's just adding to something that's already excessive which is leaving the game to enter the inventory system.
---
There's quite a bit of new content on the pts that will hopefully be dropping in the next week or so.
---
"Shotguns were always intended to be useless."
---
Why hasn't this man been hired for the dev team yet?
---
iv gotten 2 pies
---
1 from a nuke silo and the other from the rusty pick
---
With the amount of work the game needs, i wouldnt be surpirsed if it was everyday for the next year
---
That's what I thought they were too.
---
Plus there is that whistle that controls them. Didn't they have a train whistle sound in the encrypted notes.
---
So you can see them in the grass

I run that event all alone so easy even easier when people show up and I always get the 4 boxes
---
I did the exact same thing. Turtle's videos have really helped me learn the game and adopt my own playstyle.
---
As long as nobody starts launching nukes irl..... O_o
---
blood eagles seem to have handmades, too, might trying mass murder of those buggers
---
Check that your psn or xbox live is still current. Same happened to me a while back at midnight. I erased the game reinstalled and no dice.my live ran out worked after I purchased it
---
This has been my look since day one of Colossal.
---
R.i.p survival, fun mode that bethesda gave up on. Was VERY high risk with the potential to make a huge amount of caps junk and aid items.
---
When everyone who has loot to grab from it has done so and looted all of it the ash piles will disappear. If someone leaves something unlooted it will sit there until they leave the area. I mostly play on private and this is my observation with ash piles. I believe I have seen the same action with goo piles but I have not had as much experience with them.
---
I can imagine the difficulty and complexity at an event on a public server.
---
You have to replace the damaged cores. On my first run through a silo, I picked up every mainframe core in the area. After replacing the damaged cores, I kept them and repaired them at my camp. I now take the repaired cores with me into silos and keep the damaged cores to repeat the process. Doing this has made going through a silo much faster. I hope this helps you out.
---
This could potentially fix the issue where you see headless, invulnerable creatures.

Ive been just simply buying things that I know I can sell later even if I know I'm overpaying. Almost anything junkie or bloody and explosive is money in the "bank" for later. I figure if they put something I REALLY want and can't get to drop I can bundle some of it up and get it. If I decide to quit the game random players gonna get one hell of a surprise when I roll up on them.
---
Is he using the CAMP module skin from the legendary run? Its still bugged, I have a friend using it and she has the exact same issues. Maybe 1 in 10 logins her camp will show as normal and I can travel directly to it, but normally it is greyed out and I can't click it.
---
I‚Äôm done with Earle. 1 win, half a dozen fails. Too costly.
---
You take a chance on public to avoid turning into a hermit. Its also fun to be social with others, so it gives the illusion that you have friends.
---
Fr. But I was just curious if it‚Äôs my region or if it‚Äôs everyone because everyday is a bit much. Tbh Bethesda needs to stop pumping out micro transactions and passes until the major bugs are addressed. Like the game still crashes semi frequently and textures are super bad I don‚Äôt get why they‚Äôre adding stuff before fixing stuff
---
Wait it affects everyone but the user? How does that work?
---
Not 100% sure but I think that was the Grafton monster ü§î
---
But to answer your question yes, its been happening to me around 2 AM where i live
---
Yeah, getting both the Gauss Shotgun and Gauss Minigun is a long slog.
---
Weirdly enough, I'm using a Quad Flechette Harpoon gun, and as a heavy weapons guy, its one of the best "shotguns".
---
&gt;grumper
---
you are a  grumper
---
You can turn grass off completely. Set grass to 0 in the custom.ini file
---
Plus with Beth putting out all the plushies in the ‚Äúfree‚Äù category hopefully they‚Äôll put out both of the mr fuzzy place able plushies, and I can finally finish my collection
---
You should check next time to see how many people are in that session. The only time I've seen it happen is when there was like less than 10 people
---
Yeah, I wasn't sure which one it related to. Thanks for the correction.
---
Your character was still on cooldown. It's 3 hours, like the silo cooldown. If the silo is on cooldown you can't get down the elevator.
---
My first reaction upon seeing all those steel beams is "R.I.P budget."
---
Yeah, I bought the bundle because the outfit is amazing, and also liked the throne and the weapon skin, even tho I won't use that one, but the plushie should be a part of it.
---
Angry Turtle made a video about this yesterday, they fixed that, since respawning from goo piles works on the PTS.
---
That's not a fix.  They need to address this issue on ALL platforms.  Consoles can't turn off grass, and have no other means to get a work-around.
---
Xbox, it's all sorted now.
---
It‚Äôs your build according to the description I don‚Äôt think you actually understand how the mechanics work
---
I deleted my post on accident but if you still want my aa33 fixer I held onto it
---
 It was cathartic to know that I took a big  fat shit  on this post
---
One of the triggers for a server shutting down is the current player count in the server. Wish I could remember if it was 6 or 4 that would trigger it.
---
That‚Äôs why I did it, I had a rough time with the learning curve when i first started, so now I always hang in a casual team and try and help out low levels when I see them on the map just to give them a bit of a helpful nudge
---
I just go around when I‚Äôm at max caps and buy all the plans I can find and maybe vendor hop for some way too cheap weapons
---
Just finally hit max rep. What a pain in the ass.
---
Make sure you do Wards daily in foundation. When you turn the equipment in, do it for rhe no caps option. Youll get more reputation that way than if you ask for a reward.
---
Theres also rhe Photo Opportunity daily given by Davenport at the Overseers house. 
---
Youll have to take photos of either Vrater or Foundation. But heres the trick. Whichever faction you are trying to build reputation with most, turn the photos in to them instead of Davenport. So for example, I aligned with the raiders and had to work to build up my rep with Foundation. Id ohotograph Crater every day, and donate the photos to Ward. Then you tell Davenport you were jumped and had the photos stolen and still get the reward. 
---
The Crater daily can come from Rocksy or Wren. 
---
And if you donate mirelurk meat to the raiders at Ohio River something or other youll get a tint bit of raider rep as well.
---
I want to see a game where I have more fun and run into funny moments more than I find glitches but mainly just want some new content (story and gameplay)
---
Don‚Äôt forget to visit the hidden one above Harpers. They all need the petting.

You want me to waste my life by playing a game in which I waste my life by playing a game? 
---
That sounds like Inception with extra steps.
---
Are you saying if I launch silo alpha, then log on to another server I have to wait 3 hours on a new server before I can launch alpha again?
---
It was the targeting computer that said missile reconstruction was still in progress. Also the voice over told me that.

Alright thanks for the info I tried looking it up but can‚Äôt really find much

People are always like,"why is that pie in that cabinet?"

This person needs a damn medal

Have you tried adjusting your perks around to make yourself a harder target? Most people that go after workshop want an easy fight.
---
Personally, if I stumble across a dead Murgle one more time, I'm just gonna fall apart.  Just let me tame that cat and give it a permanent good home.
---
If you take enough damage to kill you it can do a number on your armor condition, especially with lower level gear, and before you have Fix It Good and White Knight.
---
It‚Äôs not a glitch it‚Äôs a feature MINECRAFT 76
---
The Gauntlet you get from the Settlers looks like it was made to be bolted on to something. I was really hoping we would get a PA mod to use them.
---
I'm over 350.  Was in a game today with a 330 and a 128 that were talking mad shit to a 74 and a 48 who joined us.
---
We took Earle down with 12 min to go.  They kept the spawn off of us.  They helped keep him penned in.  They saved me some cores.
---
This was after failing one that had no one under 300... so the irony was pretty thick
---
Have you considered the idea that maybe your 'husband' is actually from a parallel dimension? The reason why his icon is grey is because he can never fully integrate into 'our' universe....

Be careful, if he has a goatee, then he is the 'evil' twin (Star Trek confirms this).
---
It's a great event to use them on if you milk it a little bit. With my xp buffs goingz I'm getting a little under 800 xp per wendigo, and 6k xp as an event completion reward. I almost always gain an entire level per event, it's great.
---
Just wipe off the dirt
---
Was it the one that the archer is using when the trailer gets to the ACP part? Mask does not look like reclaimed deep mining mask. Never seen that one before.
---
In 1400+hrs, I've gotten 3 legit. Got photos of the claw grabbing each time. They make for decent loading screen pics. 
---
And just saying, but I've clicked on every single one I've ever seen, sometimes trying multiple times. lol
---
Discord auctions on mid tier items, plans, outfits. Then trade said items for high tier legendaries and legacies
---
Yes that‚Äôs it, did you see the outfit too?
---
No, just use the clean sink. Freggin' beggars! /s
---
I think a better solution would be to implement the ability to delete multiple fucking photos. Either that or toggle the prompt on or off.
---
I've sort of been noticing my rolls and drops along these lines for a while. Like, my rolls would be in a section of the alphabet, Assassins, Berzerkers, Bloodied, for example, but within that there would be some variance. Jump to another server and I'd see, Mutants, Mutant Slayers, Suppressors, Regenerating together. The other night, my world drops were all Suppressor, three in a row from randoms found in the world. 
---
One night, I was trying to get some UNY arm pieces and I went to the armor bench at the Rusty Pick. That's where I've been rolling frequently, since I had a fluke there where I rolled a pretty good UNY Chest piece. I had about 15 or 20 modules, so I rolled 3 at a time back to back. A few of those instances, I rolled the same 3* prefix in a row with different secondaries. I can recall it was 2 Ghoul Slayers, 2 Cloaking, 2 Chameleon - really seemed strange for "RNG".
---
I'm wondering, is there a limiter of some kind that could be added to the server itself to make it more predisposed to dropping one prefix or another?  Like, say that you've got a server  where it's foggy all of the time, and another where it's always sunny. Are legendary drops just a setting that can be flipped on and off?
---
This is not very true. The way the damage equation works, you'll continue to see pretty linear gains in survivability for added armor rating no matter how high you go. I made a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z7IwVO6UEHs1RjT-QQFc5stAIrUtlHM36LRK8ZLWTPg/edit?usp=sharing) at one point. Basically, doubling your armor rating will roughly double how much damage you can take before you die, no matter whether you're at 50 armor rating or 500.
---
That would be cool. Or even using them as future seasons  designs. There are only a few board games in the game. Using a comic book as the map would be cool.
---
Shit I keep forgetting they're a thing... I've got like 14 or something

This man out here answering the real questions. Respect bro

 .. If it's not an exact science, it's not science. It's beleif.
---
Of course, you do you, no harm in having a ritual. But a system with significant unexplainable outliers is not a system. It could easily be guided by something beyond your control but coincidentally possible. 
---
For example, if it was based on a mathmatical formula that uses fractions of a second to generate the number that gives you the items final value, and you clicked at a rate of around 1/s, you might get a result that looks like a batch system but varies based on when you started clicking. So you change server, but what you're really doing is varying your start time for your clicking.
---
Honestly, without a code dive, it would be near impossible to reverse engineer the actual system in place. There are just too many possibilities and not enough fine control to properly sort it out.
---
But like I said, you do you. Who knows, maybe it'll work.
---
How did you do the iron bars like this? I tried before and it didn't work :-(
---
Who knows as far as we know it's all server side but any assistance in getting more data is appreciated. I'm working on saving modules for a video demonstrating the idea and well see if it works how I think it will.
---
Yes, I have had both ash and goo disappear after I've looted them fully.
---
^ This is the likely answer.
---
Thats nice man. Good on ya
---
Serendipity and plenty of bolstering armor
---
Sometimes, all a society needs... Is a push... In the wrong direction.
---
187 hours and two wins makes me feel incredibly good. Every Port-A-Diner I see, I try.
---
Ammo , junk &amp; aid . I pretty much set for 6 months forward
---
I use serendipity and all unyielding
---
YES!  TY so much. I saw absolutely nothing about this in any place I searched.  You have saved the day.  üíúüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
---
Yup :)
---
He absolutely has a full beard so I will bet that he's been taken over.  This explains his wild tangents lately and his snore disappearing! üò±ü§£üíúüëèüèª
---
Just did this today. I even read the transcript beforehand. It didn't prepare me for thunder cunt the great.
---
I think the mothman is a parasite. Notice how all those crazed followers seem to have mothman eggs all throughout their own little nest. What if it figured out that humans will guard its eggs in exchange for being defended, or possibly even just once it can identify by their cultist trappings? Or even better, it determined that that its multitude of eggs is an effective lure to attract humans for later consumption?
---
It will soon. The change is currently active in the pts.
---
The gun is a really old model compared to the rest. Trying to add a scope or muzzle would break it I feel like. However if you do roses quests you can collect pleasant valley claim tickets and have a chance at getting a fancy single action. It looks cool and I believe it comes with faster reload, range and fire rate. And will always be a one star item.
---
i use blocker, dodgy and serendipity as only def. works quite well, except for earle, that event shreds me....
---
Agreed. I feel like we need ammo conversion mods for most of the guns. But pistols are in dire need of love.
---
Huh. Well, I wish you luck in your endeavors!
---
Going to try my best to replicate this style
---
This is pretty much the reason. Too much coding and stuff. Although a super mutant PA would be dank.
---
Was one of the things i was most interested to get in the run. Was disappointed in it before the "fix". Hung onto it in hope of improving after the update. Now just thinking of scrapping it to save camp budget. All i wanted was a simple "convert X amount of.38 ammo to X amount of what i need." Simple.
---
i read here sometimes ago to use the camera. and its a perfect workaround. pull it out and strive the expected area, it shows the names in the upper right corner.
---
That's gotta be the best one to get it out of. I was mindlessly dropping the claw, waiting for my husband to get done talking to the Purveyor and got. I squealed and yelled "I got it!."  and startled everyone in our party. I'm like, you guys don't understand. This is the first time in the history of me playing Fallout that I've ever gotten the pie. It's a glorious day. üòÇ
---
Unyielding is great is you are using the perks barbarian  but that has a limit what is your total resistance for kinetic and energy
---
I get times when the vertibots spawn out of the map, I chase them down and they fast travel or smth to the other side of the map. So I buy the cards now
---
They are misc items so do not show up in the scrap window.
---
At least you got a knife. I got a rolling pin
---
Feels bad man
---
I use treasure maps as my caps sink.
---
A few thoughts as I've given some storage advice to people now and then
---
1. If you're going to leave you lead in your storage(so basically without weight reduction perks), don't smelt the ore. Keeping the lead ore/acid weighs as much as bulked lead.
---
2. Cooking most meats essentially doubles the vendor sell prices. Glowing meat steaks tend to be one of the easiest to get and sell for a max of 11caps each.
---
3. I agree on bulking aluminum but I typically use all lead scraps I have make ammo almost immediately. Having Bandolier helps a ton too as I typically keep thousands of .50cal rounds at all times. (for lead ore, I take my excavator PA to "lucky hole", one run usually gets me at least 300 lead ore)
---
4. Don't stock up on common matierals you don't use much such as glass, ceramics, and concrete(typically only used for building). I usually don't use copper, rubber, and cork so I'll just bulk those and sell it.
---
5. Don't heavily stock on steel. I would generally say the same for wood and plastic as well. Whenever I need steel, I usually just farm mole miners from blackwater mine, throw on "scrapper", and can get a decent amount of steel(and some wood). I don't count but I think each run gets me at least 100 steel. West Tek is good for steel as well with a decent haul of plastic(laser weapons from super mutants).
---
6. The only non-perishable food that's worthwhile is probably canned meat stew(5% exp) and canned dog food if you're running the perk.
---
7. I definitely agree on selling of any grenades/mines you don't use. Throw any missiles or mini-nukes into the ammo converter too if you don't use them because explosives weigh a bunch.
---
8. Don't stock up on gunpowder. It weighs a ton and stacks up quickly(plus, since it's a MISC item, there's no weight reduction in any way).
---
9. Scrapping just about everything will reduce weight. There's only a few items that weigh less as is(some examples are the scrap bundles and floater sacs)
---
That's all I can think of at the moment in regards to that other post.
---
Serum Recipies and bullion.
---
Any plan i dont know.
---
Yeah that happened a long time ago, with bloatfly hordes I think. I guess they somehow unfixed the bug, or it was always still around just super rare
---
thanks
---
Alpha usually has all its turrets destroyed(final room). Even if they aren't, I try to sneak through to check and clear out everything.
---
At least you got a weapon igot disconnected üòì
---
dont worry, you‚Äôll get there.
---
I neverhad more than about 2k until I passed L50.
---
about 10k at L100
---
Once I got to 200....I average about 20k.
---
Heavy guns and pa all the way
---
I love Eugenie. Let's get a moove on!
---
The prosnap camera is a decent work around. But this issue could easily be fixed by adding a glow/light/beacon to meat piles and dead bodies. 
---
Similar to the way loot appears in BL, or many other modern games.
---
Seriously, there is a shooting range in 76 too. Would be a perfect spot to add it.
---
I for one don't like being raped by a Wendigo right after defeating Early and trying to grab the loot off his corpse. These dam things come out of nowhere and be like "Hey, you need a back scratch buddy? Dam, sorry that was a bit too hard I guess. Out you go then."
---
Although I‚Äôd rather it be 500 or 1000 atoms I feel like it‚Äôs the sort of thing that we would be more likely to see if we asked them to add it for a higher price, something both the consumer and bethsenda can be happy with. Maybe 1500 to whatever the 20 dollar atom bundle
---
Does just being tagged by a Tesla mean the enemy could turn into an ash pile? Or does the killing blow have to be from a Tesla for them to become ash piles and be a problem? Because my go-to at Line in the Sand has been to briefly fire at all the enemies to tag them and then let everyone else finish them off. I only "finish" Scorched that manage to run up on me and start smacking me around. No one has given me the thumbs down or messaged me about it, so it doesn't seem like it's been a problem, but I don't know.
---
Just make a public area then
---
But all I wanted to do with my Tesla is to provide free electricity to Earle's face....
---
What's so wrong with that?
---
You can just move to a different server
---
In a game that has all manner of glowing highlight effects built into it, tiny black dots was the choice?
---
Yeah, I've used my auto-tesla loads of times at Line in the Sand, especially when someone is camping nearby, if you know what I mean. And I've never had anyone thumbs down or message me about it. It may be because I try to only tag enemies and let others finish them off so we all get XP, and only deal a finishing blow on enemies that manage to get right up in my face. Does that affect whether or not an enemy turns to ash?
---
You sound like a dickhead.
---
Lol ran it with my friend earlier with a bunch of other 200+ players not sure what happened to them but me and my friend were the only ones doing damage. Couple low levels a 28 and a 50 disappeared as well it was like they took there shots on it and just hide after to claim the loot. After that we just went to a private and killed earl/ the queen back to back.
---
Had the same issue here as well on Xbox. I was tossing plasma grenades and another guy was using Tesla bad combo because that's when it went to hell.
---
Have you tried... anything at all? Or have you just done the same thing over and over and got your feelings hurt....
---
I'm sorry you don't lie something and here is a trophy for trying really hard...
---
What happens when a low level comes and takes it away?  Levels mean very little in ths game.
---
But at least you did come to the right place to cry.
---
You take a workshop and you have agreed to PvP that's what the box says when you click yes...  
---
Take your charmin soft self to a private server and be safe or don't but you make choices and you need to grow up and be responsible for them choices.
---
Read your perk cards look at your weapons and armor and play smarter.  I've fought people tonight with less knowledge than you but more heart and the guts to ask questions after a fight.
---
Maybe offer some GG'S and talk to people maybe then you'll learn and not be so easy next time.
---
This is the same complaint with the same reason you do this to yourself don't take workshops you clearly are not mature enough to take the responsibility for your own actions.
---
Movement is the key to it though
---
I just wish I could find more people selling them
---
Guess you‚Äôve never used the waster PA with a .50 cal
---
I haven't tried the gauss shotgun and can't really figure out how good it is from stats due to it being a charged weapon, but quad double barrel shotguns outperform anti-armor and junkies combat shotguns. I picked up a one star for cheap and it's really fun.
---
I have been recording my rolls in my search for the perfect set https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18XlkM1VowRACpaUkZuuYnAXE2GVK7UzaLQg22ftD0Ds/edit?usp=sharing
---
Now that wastelanders is out, I like getting them starting at lv 15 from crater raiders who are around the map
---
That will be a nice change. Still wish pistol perks weren't in the same tree as the sneak perks but it's a start. Thanks.
---
Yeah Earl is tough. Can solo him tho. Ty
---
That‚Äôs rather disappointing. Thank you for the info
---
The refrigerator should be infinite storage and should stop all spoilage.
---
I'd dump almost all my food in it and only take what I need with me.
---
I totally believe it.   Based on what I've seen, it's definitely NOT a random process when it comes to weapons from Murmur.   I had the same experience you did with crafting unyielding SS
---
Now that I have it I dont know what I'd do without it.
---
:) can take out the Queen in 46 seconds. No need.
---
Probably should have prefaced I‚Äôm level 530 and can solo queen and earl. I‚Äôm just micro tinkering. üòÉ
---
Yup they're handy victims! One of the few real improvements that came in the last few months.
---
To be tankier.  You were *just* talking about wanting to be tankier.  That's how
---
There is no bias. It's just an rng function that's used for many things where the start value is the time in milliseconds from the Unix timestamp. It uses a mersenne twister prng algorithm.
---
i knew it! there is something strange, hidden and evil inside crafting system. And it try to hide.
---
Wait this is a bug wtf?
---
Lol same thought process here. And also why I know I'm going to finish season 2 as well xD
---
Because if I get to rank 15 I'm going to want to finish the whole board. 
---
Getting any rank shy of being finished would just feel wasted.
---
Did he recant or just stop running his mouth about it as much? I've heard it's more the latter but I know very little about the man.
---
Ok then well that fire proof perk has saved me many time since I use explosive guns and with fires DoT it quickly drains the little health we have
---
Maybe Fallout 76 is the sister vault to Vault 112 and we're in a VR simulation of the post-apocalyse.
---
Explains having non-canon in the Vault Store :)
---
Yeah like fucking flux Jesus Christ I just want a jetpack
---
Yeah fireproof a must
---
Love the idea. 
---
Also add a few new holo games. 
---
A "river city ransom" type
---
A "rampage" type
---
A "contra" type
---
A "street fighter" type
---
A "sim city" type
---
Solid idea
---
I ended up getting two pies in one day. Blew my mind. Got 3 total and I'm not at 1000 hours yet.
---
I got one in my fourth visit to the pick... I feel awful now
---
I make average 5k a day.
---
I like the Gatling gun, .50 cal and LMG trio. Gatling gun is super ammo efficient, high damage per shot and low firerate. .50 cal is medium damage per shot and high firerate but still decent on ammo, the lmg has medium damage and high firerate, and ammo... we don‚Äôt talk about the LMGs ammo consumption.
---
If you need violet, nuke fissure prime, nuke whitesprings for the fluorescent. Both have other stuff to do other than flux farming, so it won‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôve wasted a nuke just on flux.
---
Bought the wife a Xbox and fallout and now shes just as hooked ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
50 cal is by far the most reliable heavy. It's hard to call any one heavy the best one though.
---
B2515r is best overall. BE15r is slightly better at mobbing but much worse at queen. If I had to choose one gun to keep, and lose everything else, I would keep my B2515r 50cal. 50 cals are just always useful. 
---
Gatling Gun and Plas Caster sacrifice dps for ammo economy. 
---
LMG and GMG are insane dps but eat more ammo. Priming them makes it manageable though.
---
I crafted 65 in total (limbs, chest) and got all unyielding + 2 acrobat's and one AP 
---
Idk but every time I talk about this people tell me to buy a lottery ticket.
---
They're not for eating ü§¶
---
I had a lv 250 (only fella there with a legacy gatling plas) thumbs down my lv 70 which has gear and ammo fed by my main. 
---
It turns out myself and the lv 250 ended up taking down earle ourselves as one by one, people left. 
---
At one point, there were 4 people standing one step up at the drop, not afk - waiting for the wendigos to clear to drop down, while my lv 70 chugged on.
---
Why is noone telling this guy what the real treasure is?!?!?!.........floater grenades üòñ
---
thats right. this game came to game pass i scooped it up... i was a prior vet of NV f3 f4 and figured i try it.. you cant rush perfection but i still recognize the improvements
---
Very doable. I've done it, multiple times. Queen first, if you put it down quick-ish you can still hit the ACP instance. I think the event is on a 5 min or so timer.
---
The animation is like, what 10 seconds ? So it would take 360 tries to even get 1 hour worth of waiting üòÇ
---
No problem!
---
I got 1300hrs, 1 main and 4 mules. One mule has over 500lbs of plans an no they're not just mounted head plans. I dropped the excess mounted plans last week cause it was over 800lbs in plans.
---
BLM has no place in this game. Take that racist garbage somewhere else.
---
I had mentioned on some other posts about making it a perk. Have it act like "dark vision" from Dishonored where all corpses/meatpile/etc are highlighted. Any with a legendary gets highlighted another color. Then anything that you have tagged for search is highlight another.
---
Thank you so much for this!
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
bruh... grow up. It's not that serious.
---
Not really racist but ok, I believe that even if people have different views everyone can be nice to each other. Hope you have a good day
---
If you travel to an Ash Heap Horde event NW of Whitespring, you go to Vault 404
---
Yeah and for less than 1k haha
---
Yes, especially if that person running away seeked revenge
---
Talking about before that option even pops up
---
if you hadn't noticed the only effect any headgear has is to protect against enviromental diseases. **ALL** headgears are useless, you're very much barking up the wrong tree if you're looking for more stats
---
r/theydidthemath
---
I don't think that is the real location, but more so a visual bug. I had a similar issue last night where it advertised a fog crawler horde, but then it took me to lucky hole mine.
---
It hitches on certain sections of the loot list if you craft in rapid succession and/or on Laggy server
---
I‚Äôll wait for the next patch but thats it
---
No problem :)
---
Oh also forgot one. When you do the chase down quest for Rocksy, make sure you tell the raider you want to talk, then tell them to join foundation. That gets you a small bit of rep with Foundation as well. And you can just lie to Rocksy and tell her hes dead.
---
Seen a post before in here about it, someone said they had it before and it was a ‚Äòdata corruption thing‚Äô and the fix was to reinstall the game
---
I was under the impression that you died and lost all your 'junk' if you didn't make it out the door in time.  Not that I need any more screws, but it would be nice to loot Earl at least.
---
I have a question about ACP is there a timer to complete the event? If so, how much time is there? I thought we were doing great. Then boom we failed the event. Lol we were all confused.
---
Ah, fun... Shame you couldn't quickly switch to the map once loaded in....
---
We need to make it more known to abbreviate to atleast ACP, CP has a meaning and goddamn it's not a good one. Will save you potentially getting flagged for obvious reasons...
---
Another question, so my issue was every-time i go to do a mission for them, it‚Äôs literally the same thing every-time, wren with vacuum tubes, rocksy with killing the members who left and the ward with a turret board or something i can‚Äôt remember. Is that normal?
---
Nah, nothing hits hard enough to warrant that extra DR. It's a honeypot
---
Ah thanks for the info
---
I believe it is 25 minutes -3 to wait for it to open, so 22 minutes. Someone might have a better answer since I'm going from memory.
---
Lol yeah lay off the pipe! I've only seen lead + concrete. And I do a lot of line in the sand events
---
Lol, were you not here for the radicals mask days? Beth won't put effects on headwear cos they realised it would effect atom shops sales. The reason the helmet cost so much is likely cos it was planned to have effects similar to the radicals mask but was changed for the same reasons.
---
No.
---
Yes it will still persist for a duration
---
The debris VFX is very buggy
---
Feels man, happens to me all the time bro
---
Not even close to a hundred hours. Got two pies two days in a row at the Rusty Pick! I also display them. :)
---
GAMERS RISE UP
---
Do you definitely have Xbox live? Don‚Äôt remember it crashing when it ran out but I‚Äôm unsure...
---
Nah plans are worth less than a cap each. But those kinds of houses are shitty low tier
---
Likey you end up on dying ser ers woth low player count.
---
I hate to say it but these may or may not be duped
---
A year ago I swore not to get FO 1st until fast travel worked properly.  Still waiting, still not spent another cent on the game. 1700 hours in.
---
Use photomode and power armor to glitch through all the doors. Stop wasting 30 minutes on a pointless dungeon
---
Unyeilding armour and some food. My stats when I can be bothered boosting them sit at 50 for perception, agility and luck, 30 for everything else.
---
Yeah i have it i payed for it 2 days ago, already reinstalling it now anyway
---
What do you have in agility and what are you doing that gets you detected?
---
I don't think there is any way to do so but I'm pretty sure 51-99 is a set amount, 100-999 is another, and 1000+ is another as well. It's a bit old but I got it from here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a17b1c/exp\_required\_per\_level/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a17b1c/exp_required_per_level/)
---
After seeing this post I went to the rusty pick and got one. It's the first time I used one of the machines. Maybe I'll never get a good legendary drop again?
---
Lol i dunno what it is about rad rat event but I had a similar thing happen except I couldn't figure out where I was
---
Thanks for the junk, pi√±ata
---
I‚Äôd even be happy to be able to turn them in directly for legendary modules or something. I get to the point I have to just dump legendaries due to scrip/cap/stash limits.
---
Most Devs don‚Äôt play their own games for various reasons.
---
Which is totally understandable. 
---
Expecting them to work on Game X and also play Game X (primarily in their free time because work is work) is just stupid.
---
I‚Äôm not a Developer but I do make Mods for Skyrim and I hardly play the game nowadays.
---
Nah I wanted to kill and eat every person I see, just like the other games.
---
I used to be all power armor. Now with the grocers backpack, Traveling Pharmacy, and SS armor or the CSA, I can‚Äôt go back.
---
I would kill for a CSA jetpack.
---
I currently wear the clean miners helmet gas mask and pristine miner outfit. Looks fine to me and that has the whole of my characters back his head exposed.
---
Nah the game is easy enough and that doesn't sell Scrapboxes.
---
This does make alot of sense, when purveyor first came out came out I'd save up scrips until I found a server that was dropping bloodied/two shot/explosive items relatively often. After finding one I'd fast travel and buy a weapon at the purveyor and found that he too would often give me that same bloodied/ts/e whatever that server was dropping. Not really the same exact thing here but i'd imagine it works similarly
---
Just guessing but maybe the concern is testers will find exploits then not tell Bethesda but use them when they get rolled into production?  Gust spitballing for some bethesda logic
---
Looking good with my quack outfit and a shell-shocked backapck.
---
A Berry mentats for the dead!
---
Get rekt
---
Are you on pc?
---
Acid extractor and water purifier
---
One of many half realized ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù. But theyed rather sell atom shop crap that is also broken most of the time
---
As far as I know the slot only has to be filled, the only set bonuses are for excavator and solar armor could you describe the situations that are giving you trouble? like what enemies or armor being used? Empath is also really helpful, especially if multiple people are using on your team.
---
That's good to know.
---
Eugenie and Kieran are my favorites!
---
Now this would fix alot of issues.
---
Trap camps wouldnt be able to steal...
---
Explosive bait on shoppers, atleast you don't get robbed. 
---
I can't see any downsides.
---
Agreed, it's based on some idea that I can play a bit every day.  Wrong.. I can't play most days but can play a lot some days.  the whole time gating works hard to limit my play time.
---
They already have flies, all they need to do is make them GLOW, because radiation. Its perfect, if i can think of it why cant bethesda.
---
Rare drop from Queen
---
Broadsider has been broken since launch. It is dominated by server ping.
---
I would like to make this, can you tell me where the camp location is.
---
I‚Äôve had this issue on Xbox too
---
Half the time i try this the camera doesnt pick up anything, no names displayed even if im pointing it directly at a corpse
---
It wasn't in a workshop it was some sort of cargo drop which is why I didn't think there was any issues with me unlocking it .
---
Because the guns created for this game weren't made by people confident with the modular weapon platform.
---
This is like when a line forms behind you at the sketchy gas station ATM.
---
Dude, you get in you get out.
---
Dude me and a buddy have been looking for that plan for a long time. The drop rate on that plan I believe is lower than 1%. Chances are you will probably never obtain that plan either from the SBQ  or a player vendor. Your better off forgetting about it.
---
Yea, the whole death of pets thing is the main reason I have not done this.
---
I really want a dog for a pet but they will die instantly any time the camp is attacked so there is no reason to try to find and tame one.
---
It's pretty simple to add all the ghoul skins and facegen options to the looksmenu. Plenty of mods for fallout 4 do it.
---
What is hard, is setting it up like Skyrim with different playable races with different traits.
---
They're over thinking it.
---
That X RESPAWN thing is getting REALLY REALLY old.  If I could find out a way to profit from it, it would be fixed next Tuesday.
---
I‚Äôm curious why they sell so high considering how easy it is to find the drone.
---
Try to complete it on a private server or wait for the fix in Patch 22. It‚Äôs a known bug.
---
Food is far to easy to obtain as it is. I would like to see it become way more scarce, which would be more realistic in a post apocalyptic survival situation
---
By "brotherhood patch" do they mean Steel Dawn or Factured Steel or both?
---
Watoga vendor bot has the plan for the handmade.
---
Scrapping is the only way to get mods - make sure you put super-duper on when making and buff your intelligence when scrapping to give you a better chance at learning mods :)
---
In my **heavy** gunner i literally carry 20+ weapons and i'm not overencubered (Bear Arms + callibrated shocks + excavator PA)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
On my sniper i carry 2 and that's it.
---
Bethesda devs: ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs easiest way to fix god mode?‚Äù
---
Todd Howard: just don‚Äôt let them respawn if they goo themselves 
---
Bethesda devs: genius!
---
Fuckbuddy
---
Never has
---
Dude, since the last patch I've gotten about 6/7 (non from west tek). Either I'm being really lucky or they're easier now. About 750 hrs played
---
You right, I concede, I only did the bos line once despite playing the game a hundred fucking times lol, they kinda suck for keeping anybody alive that's why I prefer railroad or minute men...now I have a settlement to go help.
---
Ps4
---
From my experience, the scanner turns red and I can't enter if the silo is in the cool down period.
---
I think there are some YMMV glitches with the silos though.
---
&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 you called me a God
---
Last week I had this bug with all my rifles. But it‚Äôs back to normal these days. There‚Äôs no permanent way to fix it, it just happens.
---
As you said, it's instanced. When one instance is full the game creates another and puts the extra players into a new separate instance.
---
Yeah some other people pointed that out I just didn‚Äôt know cause the game doesn‚Äôt really tell you
---
#1 rookie mistake
---
That workshop is not your camp
---
I want my 3* level 50 chainsaw so I can become Doom Slayer. 
---
Of the wasteland.
---
I've only ever seen it once in a vendor for 25k caps. I had to swap a 3* junkies explosive combat shotgun to get mine.
---
It should work like a vendor where you sell any amount of ammo you dont want for points and buy any amount of ammo you do want with the points
---
Im on PS4 and I HATE playing Line in the sand. For some reason that event lags so hard to the point that the enemies are just teleporting around everywhere. Its so annoying.
---
How do you have an explosive ultracite gatling laser? They're not supposed to exist.
---
How did you get that spiral staircase?
---
He can build whatever he chooses, it is HIS camp after all.
---
I don‚Äôt often get rage quit angry with the game, but if I do, it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve completed a nuke silo. I‚Äôve been playing since beta and I‚Äôve only done maybe 5-6 nuke launches personally. Last night I wanted to play my 5th colossal problem so I decided to launch a nuke, spent 40 minutes working through bravo, launched my nuke, went to fight Earle, and he spent a large portion of the fight in the ceiling! Again (second time I‚Äôve lost due to this issue)! I mean it‚Äôs frustrating attending the event and having this happen, but being the one who has already committed time to launching the nuke and having this happen is just other worldly frustrating.
---
Could you imagine if I had to actively work through cracking the silo code before even attempting to launch the nuke? OMG! Thank god for nuke crypt.
---
Everything in that box is worthless. Don't waste your time with garbage ore
---
I have 'no blm' and 'looters are shot on sight' stenciled under my commissary sign.  People get a kick out of it based on feedback.  Maybe bethesda, like EA, were too quick to jump on the bandwagon and get involved in political crap in peoples' escapist entertainment media...
---
Any time it gives you a 30min countdown it means they're killing the server, any time it's a 5 min countdown it's likely a patch/update/maintenance.
---
[I salute you sir ](https://tenor.com/LPJZ.gif)
---
There's a bunch of hidden variants on the raider armor you can't craft
---
Its a de gatling laser, was using term UGL for OP's benefit, as thats the variant he should look for his build. 
---
Once he has enough to trade for legacies I'm sure he will look for what best suits him and learn what is available, figured the fine details aren't as important in this thread.
---
I see, thanks for clarifying :)
---
What we need is a fix to the rifle ammo glitch that will limit the dps of an automatic rifle
---
Haha camp go bye bye
---
I figured something like that yeah, but.. how many is 'full' and why did it let me swap instances, that can't be right!! Maybe it's a #bethesda??
---
All my pies are legit except for five I bought off a vendor and I won't grab any from west tek to dilute that fact! I'm proud of them and will never sell!
---
Yeah stay down there, keep looting. You'll get the rewards and the event will complete after the timer runs out.
---
Yeah I havent learned any others besides Elder
---
That is what I did when I met my wife, "you ever heard of world of warcraft? look you can be a panda, cute huh?"
---
I'll sell you one for 300k
---
Actually..... You don't even have to claim a workshop to be pvped.... Just be in the circle when someone hits claim. I was doing events,  defend workshop appears so I joined in.. Only for the owner to leave thus making it unowned.... His public team mates then hit claim and melted me before I even knew wtf happened. So much for agreeing to pvp. 
---
Workshops maybe are pvp zones but to me, the only real people who pvp there are just looking for quick junk. And if they don't get your junk cause you standing outside the circle.... Then the real fun starts, explosive bait or nuke mines.
---
This explains why she stands on her own and no one will talk to her
---
I think once an instance hits 8 players it creates a new one for additional players. You didn't swap instances. The second one sounds like it was a minute or so behind the original one you were in. By travelling to your friend you just went to his instance. Nothing bugged or magical about it.
---
My alt is a bloodied. I'm more scared of mole rats than I would be of Puss n Boots.
---
Pretty much. They should quit while they are ahead before they end up like the NBA.
---
Get woke, Go broke. 
---
\#Trump2020
---
Blast zones are underwhelming AF
---
Yup Effort : Reward, 100 : 1
---
Ok in that case, PSA, but you see two instances goin on, and yours finishes first, GO GET ANOTHER EARL!!
---
It will count for the poison resist and fire resist legendary perks. But it's cosmetic only right now
---
I wear it with the T Leather Coat and like how it looks.
---
Very rare random
---
You sound like the type who annoys me so much I‚Äôll use my laser rifle even though I can kick your ass left right and center with my handmade.
---
I've read this post 5 minutes ago, logged to the game, was near Camden Park, took a spin and got my first pie on first ever attempt :) I guess having 39 luck helps a bit with the [formula](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Perfectly_preserved_pie_(Fallout_76)) ;)
---
It would have been more efficient to hunt them down and force PvP... But the nuke sends the message.
---
Ohhh I wonder if this explains some weirdness I had today with two Earls happening simultaneously.   There was a SBQ happening just before as well.  I was able to FT to a friend (yeah I know, fast travel worked wooo :) ) and get in on two Earl kills basically at the same time.  If there's a gltch that spawns Earl outside the intended mechanics that might be why..
---
yeah but everytime you see camp with alot of plans of sale its all just mounted heads for 150 caps each for some reason. No one wants that shit stop it.
---
Good
---
I died yesterday for the first time right after Earl died and before I could get to the body. I re-spawned outside of the mine but luckily managed to fast travel to a teammate who was still in there and loot the red chest just before the timer to escape ended. But I got the rewards and credit for completing the event. Another cursed harpoon gun. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
---
But if you die and spawn outside, fast travel to someone inside and you should be okay. üëåüèª
---
My fave is actually a furious explosive LMG.  Quick, aims properly, kills things nicely.  Ammo consumption is a bit rapid.  If you don't like explosive, I'd use FFR.
---
Bloodied would be a good prefix to swap for Furious of course if you want.  Make sure you're set with the Stabilized perk!
---
I'm wondering what the new gauss minigun is like...
---
Sometimes i feel like bethesda hates its players
---
I found One at the Philippi Battlefield Graveyard and another on the top of west tek
---
Or just have it removed the skin...
---
Very rare plan that you will most likely be better off bartering for on the trading sub. I think if ur running straight ultracite PA someone who knows the plan can mod ur parts but if ur running strangler you will have to know it. I'm level 260ish and I've only ever seen it in a player vendor once and it was 25k. 
---
Tbh it's easier to run X01 with any mods you want and you probably won't notice the difference. It's at least a good option while you wait to get the ultracite plans you want.
---
Unfortunately yep. Theyre the same repeatables every day just like your other daily quests. Boring beyond words.
---
And?  What‚Äôs your point?  Bethesda fully endorsed duping by letting everyone they banned back with their duped weapons. It‚Äôs not getting you banned by having one in your stash, trading for one or as in this case......and I assume it was either scrip or lower lever stuff....an act of outstanding generosity
---
wow... you should be in the Olympics with those mental gymnastics.
---
Where is that? Is it marked on the map?
---
It's a personal cool down, you dont lose the keycard tho.
---
People would soon change their minds though when the griefers unite and ambush people at workshops. PvP is so broken in this game.
---
Made it with the lowest coffee tables. It's a bit hard to walk up though. There's one I've seen that was super smooth but I have no idea how he did it haha
---
Oh you little....
---
This. Exactly this. My heavy gunner carries about 10 or so, my pistol character had nine at one point, my shotgunner carries five and my melee character carries six.
---
I had to put up several rifles just because I couldn‚Äôt carry them.
---
7. One of those lasers an assaultron has with an auto target feature.
---
Omg I see your camp all the time on PS4 üòÇ me and my boyfriend were admiring the use of the beams.
---
That so funny! I saw your camp a short while back, loved the artistry in architecture.
---
I've had that happen a couple of times, once it took me deep inside a missile silo and the other one took me to The Burrows
---
This. They claimed it was a coding mistake to put every different effect on the radicals masks. And then set them to RNG.......must have pressed the wrong button or something. Easy mistake to make!
---
Hello to whatever FBI person who got triggered to this sub for the title.
---
Blm is...the opposite of racist... so there's that.
---
On my private world he always tells me to come back. Any ideas?? I haven't been able to do it at all.
---
What?
---
cus it enters it into the open world. so your personalized skin prevents that, so it deletes the object instead. 
---
obviously the better option is to delete the personalized skin and have it show up as default but hey video games are complicated. 
---
i fully understand why its so low on the priority list of fixes cus the solution is just dont be dumb.
---
If you blueprint 2 stacked, you can set them down without having to snap them to anything.
---
Lmao same, this travel ling merchant showed up and my turrets were pissed! Then suddenly Buckett joined in. The merchant started playing the guitar and Bucket said "Is that the best you can do?" So I think it's just some kind of prejudice
---
Get a group together. When the event launches, have your 'leader' go to the even. Fast travel to your leader. You should be in the same instanced event.
---
Another person said that anti-armor is best for this event, and I've found that to be true for the most part. FFR helps as well. If you have a 'Final Word' from helping Beckett, that's one of my 2 favorite weapons to use.
---
4 days ago I had tamed 2 deathclaws and three megasloths because they had kept dying or not going to my camp. The last megasloth I tamed lasted till today. Now it's dead. Glitched in the natural terrain. Thanks Bugthezda -.-
---
I've been in that vault as well after traveling to a horde event. It felt eerie in there to be honest, I even found a mine connected to the vault
---
Did you read the huge popup warning you that the item will be destroyed?
---
Thank you for answering this because i thought it was glitching or something idk. Sounds terrible. AND you don‚Äôt get anything for being neighborly?? I‚Äôm trying to find the point but i‚Äôll still do it because i‚Äôm bored
---
Wow that‚Äôs amazing!
---
Yep. Mentioned it to my wife who said I need to grow up. But she smells so whatever
---
We try so hard and yet Bethesda continues to fail us even in our most needed times
---
Just taking a good long break after it being my (more then) full time job for the past few months. I likely would have stopped earlier, but I felt compleed to grind through the recent event.
---
I'll likely be back someday, but right now I'm pooped.
---
so the relog/ analyse dna first works, but its alot faster if you have access to a private world.
---
‚ÄúKick his ass sea bass!‚Äù
---
PvP needs to go back to its own server like every other MMO. It doesn't work or even fit in adventure.
---
I get told by friends that I‚Äôm too lucky. I have won so many. It never gets old but the first is always the best.
---
\*Gets Pie\*
---
\*Drops Pie\*
---
\*Gets Cry\*
---
Are you not allowed to have ammo stations?
---
As you level up your reputation, the vendors will unlock faction specific plans like the gauss shotgun or farmable floor tiles etc. So its a painful grind but wortg ir to unlock those plans. Youll nees to purchase those with gold bullion tho.
---
That would be great along with a mothman one. Also they really need to put the Wavy Willards plushie back on the shop. They've put many others up numerous times but not that one, it's the one that I'm missing.
---
BTW bushes and objects that clutter the ground are outside the grass settings.
---
I was shocked, myself.
---
I thought I played Fallout 4 a ton and looked and saw I had only played 104 hours on that. And I also felt I got to the endgame. Built-up all my bases, everyone's' needs were met, etc. 
---
I pretty much had it as a full-time job (with some overtime) for the past few months.
---
It's so sad. You'd think they would say okay guys so we have 100 problems with the game. This week let's work on 1 XD
---
Ohhhhh okay, didn‚Äôt know that. Thanks!
---
Just lower the price to like 250 or 100
---
No, they are not needed. All you need is a keycard and the correct code. 
---
The game doesn't care how you get the code.
---
Shoot at this rate it'll take me 600 more hours to get full unyeilding and a bloodied fixer. RNG hates me. Congrats on your accomplishments.
---
Yea let‚Äôs fix the flower in the cranberry bog that is clipping a little inside drop site V9
---
I guess you could say I‚Äôm a fan! I also love dressing up in random outfits and taking pictures. If only I could take off my pip boy.
---
And your complaint is that people are organising to win a team game?
---
 Grow up please. Either ask other players for help instead of solo/random queuing or just stop playing Nw if it losing to people on with their friends rustled you.
---
The Fallout timeline is different to ours. :)
---
PvP used to work like that. A small amount of people whined and whined about it. Beth knackered it like it is. Now everyone is whining that its not fair as you cant get your team mates to defend u....
---
Srry just saw this but I'm on 76 everyday eather with my friend or the girl I love but if you tell me ur g tag il look out for ur camp and see if ur there
---
I use it with the hunters long coat. It looks great with it
---
I want to pick up the goo and eat it. Maybe make tea with the ashes.
---
How does one man put out so much content.  Fair play to turtle.  His videos seem to fill in the gaps.
---
That‚Äôs intentional and the OP just didn‚Äôt read the message!
---
I can do it for you. 630 pm what timezone?
---
Guessing u didn‚Äôt read the massive pop-up that tells you it will be deleted!

Robot vendor with humans working a supply line. All the robots in 76 are faction bots with no human counter parts to support with that ammo. Except the brotherhood who‚Äôs coming back when steel dawn hits.

Thank you. I'll delete this now and repost without the abbreviation
---
Would you resub 1st if you didn‚Äôt need it for the scrapbox anymore? Honest answer!
---
Been playing since day one and about 3 weeks ago I got my first one. A day later got my second. Proudly displayed in my vendors for 6000 caps each because why not.
---
Acp is the term used for the event bro happy to help
---
Is that even a base??? IT LOOKS AMAZING
---
This was really helpful, thanks! :)

The system is the way it is for a reason. You can blame griefers for that
---
Well, Covid has some errie similarities to the Fallout New Plague.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/New\_Plague](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/New_Plague)
---
Don't know about you but I started hoarding bottle caps and other junk...
---
Works exactly the same as a public server but with the novelty of choosing who gets to play in said server.
---
Private servers are good for farming Junk &amp; playing with friends.
---
I've made people run before just by getting a gamma out üòÇ I've a 2shot with limb damage so if i wanna melt someone I'm good üòâ
---
Every time I grab one out of a machine I keep it. Think I'm up to around thirty now somehow. Key thing is to hit every darn machine you see.
---
Congrats on your pie!
---
Exactly this. And the bonus of keep my Brahmin alive because people keep killing chally moo moos cousin
---
hahaha that's awesome! that specific character has been wearing the mole head and swimsuit combo since... probably around when Survival mode was announced? it's been a really long time. i love taking weird and fun pictures with her, and her outfit gets a LOT of reactions out of people. sometimes i make temporary friends who also put on a swimsuit and crouch-run around with me, acting like creepy lil gremlins and terrorizing innocent bystanders.
---
(here's where I get really dorky) she's got a bit of lore, in that she's just a freak and is an irradiated idiot (suuuper low hp bloodied, trapper, uny/cav melee build). no one knows what she looks like under the mole helmet (*I* don't even remember...), she eats almost exclusively ionized and spoiled meat. She can 1-3 hit most things with bloodied, swing speed knuckles. I have **so** much fun playing, it's wild. she dies constantly but when cavalier kicks in, watch tf out lmao
---
I saw that it looked like fallout shelter.
---
I've seen the SQB fighting a Wendigo Colossus in a nuked zone. It was an interesting sight. The photos make good loading screens. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Congrats! It's just as satisfying next time round :D
---
Thanks. But does it still do the thing where it will just find any empty world that could be looted? Or does it now actually give a fresh world?
---
It will, there's a certain threshold (time or distance) to it. You won't be visible on attacker's map for its duration, which helps.
---
i never understood WHY we could NOT have it count towards our stats since visually we STILL USE UNDER ARMOR in a power armor frame, if you have no armor parts on your frame and wear it you can see the under armor is still equipped on your character while inside the frame so why then would it not count for stats? :/
---
I think the purveyor has a higher drop, just a theory though. I‚Äôm ~390 hours in, and had 2 drop, both from there.
---
I'm not Beth employee but if I could mod 76 it would be day 2 modification.
---
If you have been on an looted recently it‚Äôll be empty where you looted but when I do a junk run I pick up everything even if I don‚Äôt need it then go back to camp. Log off private. Switch to public for 5-10 mins and the spots usually refresh
---
Fresh world everytime you load into private :-)
---
Gonk
---
Nothings worse when people kill my Brahmin out of spite. Wankers lmao
---
I sure do love that big brown beaver and i wish i did have a pair
---
Thanks, that's just what I was hoping to hear.
---
That's great to hear, thanks.
---
I had someone literally phase through my wall to kill mine like why..
---
As a low level, first play through, character I received a three star bloodied legendary weapon from a generous high level player.
---
In return I gave them my perfectly preserved pie. 
---
It‚Äôs the only gift I could give a player who has everything. I hope it was well received.
---
Desk fans.... Typewriters....
---
Preparation, organization, and communication lead to success?  If only there were a life lesson here
---
Never noticed any lag from it and I use mine all the time since it's most viable way to tag mobs cuz the games created to be anti-social when it comes to sharing credit with others and XP with anyone, including teammates. 
---
But if it exists though maybe Bethesda should fix it and you should be focusing on them. Or are you running into hackers using weird stuff or legacy explosive teslas? I haven't seen an explosive one in-game yet to know.
---
It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs a TEAM game
---
Thank you too
---
Definitely running the fandango theme tune next time
---
THIS! (looking at you photo op üòíüòí)
---
&gt;Workshops are about resource gathering.
---
Yes. And PvP. I just don't understand the try-hards who say don't use when we want to get materials... from junk hoarders.  
---
Anyway, you can get a ton of alu from the coolant caps in Harper's Ferry Armory; power cores from bots and nuclear waste is always being sold by players. Or just don't carry junk around in workshops and the worst you'll suffer is an unceremonial death.
---
That players don‚Äôt have to flip through walls to find an endgame boss who somehow floated up through the ceiling
---
With showering animationt too I'd hope. I would buy that.
---
Also want a quiet skin for the fusion generator. Been waiting for one forev'
---
Especially dogs and cats, they‚Äôre only level 1!! At least the deathclaws are level 21 so they get a bit of chance..still want a dog again tho. 
---
One day..
---
I just used it as a fast travel point to atlas
---
I see a lot of people complain about low levels but two decent characters can easily waste him. A vampires heavy with adrenal reaction is pretty much his krytonite. He seems to go down as easily as the queen but because of the spawns and the scream you struggle maintaining DPS. With vampires and 40% health in PA you can stand there and unload. 
---
To be honest I‚Äôve seen level 20/30 players with bloodied weapons and semi optimised builds do more damage than me.
---
There is no way to determine why someone is claiming a workshop and since these are unfortunately the only place we can pvp, (it warns you of this when you take the workshop) it is often assumed that the owner is looking for a fight.  
---
If you are looking for resources, don't bother with a ws.  You get stuff faster anywhere else.  
---
To claim for the challenge then stealth into the area.  Stay in stealth to take out the creatures you need to kill first, then once you get the claim the workshop part, don't click on the workbench, move near the boundary if you know where it is, then use whatever button it is for you that would enter build mode to claim.  During this time, move to the boundary edge somewhere, as soon as the claim is complete step outside.
---
Claiming for fun, please remember that ws are pvp areas and pvpers fight over them for fun.  You are best off on a private server for that.  
---
Believe it or not, not all of us want to stomp on those who are clearly not wanting to pvp.  Some of us would rather have a proper fight.
---
Just open your arms and embrace getting fucked. You were only there for 250 SCORE anyways lol
---
It's an honour to be killed by a coordinated team.
---
Oh ok thanks
---
Just came to say that I've not done any formal testing but I have played since beta and I think you are about right and this has been the case for a long time. 
---
When the purveyor was first released I was trying to land a junkies handmade  (I eventually rolled a je, which I still use üòé) and I found that if killed a legendary and it dropped a weapon with a specific prefix then immediately fast travelled to the purveyor I had a much greater chance of getting that roll again. In the case of the je, I think it was a junkies machete that was the 'wild' drop, so I dont think it's tied to weapon 'class' or anything.
---
I also think there is something like this which applies  weapon types, as I've seen that specific weapons will drop in 'group's' so, out of 10 rolls, you might see 3 or 4 grenade launchers for example. I once got 4 fixers in 10 rolls, which was nice üòä shame 2 of them were rubbish üôÑ
---
I just use the Take Screenshot function on Xbox and have a file on my PC with all those photos. I tend to make the photos I keep look like a typical loading screen.
---
I swear there used to be a port-a-diner somewhere on the map that had a 100% drop rate. I remember testing it a few times and getting several pies in a row.
---
SO IT IS POSSIBLE
---
When you don‚Äôt have bugs it‚Äôs incredible. 
---
A vampires roll fully perked out with adrenal reaction and PA is my favourite shotgun in the same right now. 
---
I‚Äôm expecting from what I‚Äôve seen of community manager posts re the new damage multiplication update that this will also solve some of the lag and rubber banding of enemies health bars. The shotgun suffers madly from this because your effectively firing multiple times in an instant. 
---
It is useless for mobs though the insane damage then proceeds to slay you unless you jet pack into the air and spray downwards.
---
Monster Hunter has a mod that adds light pillars on dropped items. Fucking love that mod.
---
 [https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterworld/mods/112](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterworld/mods/112) 
---
Need something like that here.
---
I don't know if it would have helped you in this instance but maybe next time stay in stealth while building.
---
Uhhh i don't really care if you attack me, ill just either beat you very badly like i do with most people, or ill get wrecked by some overpowered tesla user who stacks consumables then i go to a different server and not being bothered 95% of the time.
---
The intention behind the design of workshops is resources gathering, PVP is a band aid feature to prevent players from hoarding workshops themselves.  That is why it's there, if they wanted to encourage PVP to take place at workshops then they would create events or modes surrounding PVP in workshops.
---
I did all that soloed ,
---
bro Fallout 76 is the COVID, just think about it... the scorched plague that came from bats...?! it kinda predicted the COVID
---
Bloody sledgehammer :) Ok. I'll just reiterate: Workshops are resource **and** PvP points. If you've played since Beta, you'd remember their yield used to be much higher; you could also level down player's base through the mutual PvP...  
---
Now they're just shells of their past glory.
---
I know it doesnt really solve the issue but if your photos are full and take one with the camera it counts for the quest and doesnt save, doesnt work for photomode though
---
Try switching to a Gatling with power user on, you can buy fusion cores at player vendors for &gt;100c each for 1000 rounds worth of ammo, our you can take three power stations for 9 every few mins. If you can find a V10wa one they are boss killers with adrenal reaction on and 40% health (any less the spawns will still kill you). 
---
This has basically solved my end game ammo supply, and I‚Äôm expecting that with the new update this will get even better for me. You will also no longer need stimpacks. 
---
It‚Äôs a shame they stopped sentry bots spawning fusion cores although it makes sense seeing they are the reason they explode üòÖ
---
If you are on PC I have a Vampires 1* Gatling Laser for 500c or so in my vendor. Username as per reddit.
---
Hehhah, got you talking :D
---
Is that a UFO?
---
Where is this exit chest people are talking about ive never bloody seen it üòÖüòÖ
---
I'm somewhere around 300-350 hours into the game. I have 2 characters.   
---
I always hit Port-A-Diner when I see one. So far I've got 4 perfectly Preserved Pie.  
---
One is displayed in my camp. Other is displayed in my friend's camp whom I play a lot with.  
---
The other two was proudly consumed by me and her.  
---
She has more game experience, she told me its pretty rare and I must have god RNG.   
---
Sadly, this luck only applies to  Pastry  and not legendaries...
---
My God, so much in that wiki entry mirrors the last few months... it's scary.
---
You know what i got...a damn cursed fkng shovel 3 star and a damn suppresors machete 3 star.woopidy fucking doo.wtf am i going to do with that.evey damn event has shit rewards.i make better crap than what they give out.
---
This just discourages me not to do the event.i beat him with a 2 shot gatlin laser.not bloodied in any way didn't even have perks for the heavy gun.so it can be done by any player with heavy weapons.still garbage rewards.
---
Too much work. Easier to nuke their camp
---
Only way for you to feasibly catch up is to spend atoms unfortunately. 
---
You are  about 25% through so around 11000+ atoms. 
---
I‚Äôve had to buy a few (10 or so) because I moved out of our house and our new one isn‚Äôt ready for a long time, I don‚Äôt get much chance to play atm.
---
Such comments from braindead folks don't really hurt me
---
I use bloody sledgehammer btw without a radiation build, i go full health. 
---
I know it's not efficient.. I don't try to maximize my damage, i don't try to use the same build as everyone else since i hate having rads, i use it because i found it. Still find it fun to watch my damage go up as i lose health.
---
Yeah definitely an alt if he was firing off that much ammo. I have one of my alts who only job is to craft as much ammo as possible to give to my main and others plan on her taking the legendary ammo perks eventually.. Was going to be just for thrning in extra scrip too but she was so much fun I mostly play on her now. I decided with her to do the opposite of every decision i made with my main. So she has inverse special stats etc.
---
Yeah, I checked it out in game. It's useful for some things, but the ones I'm thinking of are the multi-stage challenges. Things like Take a photo of this list of things, or at this list of places. The Scout challenges in particular tend to have multiple objectives to them, and all this does is put the name of the challenge on screen and say how many of those objectives you've completed out of how many.
---
I'd love to be able to see those objectives on screen as if they were a set quest and then just go about them. So many quests fall into the "I've randomly chosen to do this for some reason" category that it would make sense to have those work the same way.
---
Yeah, the ash piles, while annoying due to the issue where they don't disappear if still unlooted by someone else, they got nothing to do with the performance issue since U21. 
---
The lag and flickering tiles ("pixelation") at events are solely caused by someone shooting an Tesla (likely a bug with the lighting effect).

Amen! From one fucked up world we flee into another, which despite its cannibalistic super mutants and radioactive monsters, is actually more enjoyable at the moment. 
---
Plus my house in 76 is bigger than IRL... and has sentry guns üí™
---
Was in one with a 115, 35 and several 300+ ... I'm 240. All the 300+ wimped out and left, leaving the 3 of us to clean house. 
---
Myself and the 115 firing away at Earle with our HGs, and the 35 in the Raider PA blasting away at the spawns with their hunting rifle. Great fun. 
---
@ 'low levels' - you can be my wingman anytime
---
I applaud that; using melee in workshops myself (JFFS Knife). People usually don't have Blocker on.
---
Does it have its own inventory or is it just having it affects all the food in your stash?
---
The respawn timer gets longer each time you die starting from 3 seconds. If you're dying enough times to take 60 seconds to respawn then maybe you shouldn't be in there.
---
You can also launch a nuke on whitesprings and log out and back in repeatedly until the nuke ends respawnig all the enemies, easy nuke mat/legendary/xp farm
---
Yes I suppose you could do this if you can find their camp. :)
---
Agreed, Ive only had to respawn once and it was almost instant. I never understood this whole 60sec timer until your comment lol so cheers for clearing that up
---
I had a guy come into my camp the other day as I was building and start punching me. I‚Äôm pacifist but what was most annoying was that by punching me, he was physically moving me around. He then jumped on my roof and proceeded to punch me from the roof even though he was no longer in melee range. I dunno, people are weird.
---
Do you not have a lifetime supply of stimpaks? Power armor? How do you die so much?
---
I still see a few camps down that way. It seems like a nice area to set up, especially now that people aren't really nuking that area anymore.
---
Tell your friends to run in front of his gun. Pvp initiated.
---
Yep.
---
This definitely needs to be a thing !
---
I just really like the flatness and the aesthetic of the grass there.
---
The chest up the top has caps and like 6 pieces of ore though!
---
Good to know
---
Forget everything you said. Half hour to hour + silo run are you serious. Can launch a nuke in under 10 mins from entering
---
Are you using the ammosmith and super duper perks?
---
I went in with a half assed Mele toon I was dumping extra scrip on, because I thought it would be a laugh, anyhow I'm sitting there punching him in where his nuts should be getting insta stomped to death randomly. I think I died about 10 times and still never took more than 30 seconds to respawn.
---
I completely agree with this - as long as we can also add breast implants to increase Charisma.....
---
Been playing every day since April 14, been in lockdown for months, currently at stage 4 and basically can't leave the house. I have no idea what I'd do without Fallout 76, honestly.
---
YES
---
As an unarmed character I hate that my only choice of protection for nuke zones is the stealth suit. It boggles my mind that there's no power armor fist weapon or mod for the PA arms that's on par with an unarmed weapon. How hard would it be to weld some claws onto your arm or add a pneumatic strike plate?
---
Either that or have Marine and/or Secret Service armor have similar rad reduction to the stealth/hazmat suit so you can wear them in nuke zones or something.
---
I think I've only ran out of the mine once, because I heard there was a chest near the entrance 
---
 You could only loot once Earle was desd. So I followed everyone up found the chest and was... underwhelmed, so now I just look Earle's body and let myself die, cause it's way easier than finding my way back up past all those wendigo spawns
---
I'd love a Mechanist Power Armor TBH. That's honestly what that outfit should have been from the start.
---
I'd still say it's one of the most popular places on the map and every server I'm on has 2-3 camps there. I like the flat ground but would never build there as I don't want to compete with space.
---
hey. just asking.. i know he hates irish people.
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
 I one here know when they‚Äôll actually be released. The best I can tell you is soon, they‚Äôve been reworking them and changing the cost. They seem like they should be ready for patch 22, but who knows with Bethesda.
---
Are you using a heavy gun or something? Those bad boys eat ammo.
---
1. Matter of opinion
---
2. Could be from a museum or reenactment group, ren fairs and the like
---
3. The tip is small so it can better penetrate armour, a smaller area with allows for the maximum amount of force to be applied to a single spot
---
These combined with the use of melee or .38 and 10mm weapons on lower level encounters should help you to conserve your ammo for encounters in which you will need it more.
---
Some people just shrug it off as RNG, but RNG in FO76 does not seem very random at all. Even something as trivial as the "random" loading screen from your gallery seem super biased, so I'd be surprised if the legendary systems works as intended.
---
Kids these days are too young to remember the [Wi flag in Asheron's Call](https://asheron.fandom.com/wiki/Wi_Flag). Just shrugging off biased results as superstition is what kept that bug in the game for three years.
---
Wait a minute, that is a year too early...
---
Are you the bat that originally infected patient zero?
---
Oh how enlightening thank you
---
2 beavers are better than 1. They're twice the fun. Ask anyone.
---
Lucky hole mine for lead, scrapper perk for steel, Tanagra town and the rail yard in cranberry bog for acid
---
It might just be that they don't have a vending machine set up and thus don't pop up on the map, but I rarely see any camps down when I look at the map.
---
Usually they dumb enough to be on a public team ;)
---
If you die one less time it‚Äôll stop at 30 seconds. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I have a camp set up overlooking the golf course, it‚Äôs very nice to look at and play the banjo, and my spot is almost never taken, dm me for location if you want it, idk how to link stuff...
---
I'm pretty sure it is not a set amount from level 100-999. Its definitely harder to level my 380 than my 105
---
Fun fact: The pool table used in Fallout is based on the Brunswick "Anniversary" series pooltable which became popular in the mid 40's. 
---
I've had the privilege of servicing at least a dozen of those pool tables in my 15+  years as a Billiards Mechanic.
---
Is it on the green golf course or outside it?
---
I'll usually just hack the terminal and shut them off. But I'm talking all the turrets are shut down. I've had that numerous times.
---
I believed it was datamined under atx after the last patch meaning it will be atomshop now sadly
---
Congrats, you won pie master!
---
Best thing to do is go on the trade subreddit and trade with someone to mod it for you, rather than get the plan. I asked on there and got a kind person that just came to my camp and modded it for free. Most people will just ask for the materials.
---
I'll play on public I just hate doing events on public.
---
Always glad to answer someone's questions.
---
It‚Äôs a bit outside it, but it‚Äôs overlooking it, there‚Äôs a couple of trees in the way but overall it‚Äôs a really nice view. No it‚Äôs not on the green
---
I wish I could stay down and loot but my stash can‚Äôt hold anything anymore ‚òπÔ∏è
---
Well. Use this to find the stuff to make your ammo. 
---
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic
---
or just keep selling the ammo you don't need and keep buying the ammo you do
---
i use 2mm ec and it's one of the easiest and cheapest ammo to make. Which is nice.
---
Do you have any screenshots you could message me? I love a good view but I'd want to see it first.
---
I try to melee most low level encounters and use .50 cal ammo for higher stuff, it's cheaper to craft especially with ammo Smith and super duper perks (switching between melee and heavy gunner is easy if you have the cards). Also I have my camp on a lead mining node to help with materials.
---
Sure give me a moment
---
Thanks I‚Äôll look into this places
---
stop dying so much
---
Maybe it's dependant on each person's internet connection then?
---
It is annoying to get overencounbered after each event, i agree
---
I dunno, 250 dr while reloading would be pretty good with that thing as a tank weapon.
---
https://youtu.be/J3mDQvAV_hU this guy makes some good build guides you can skip to like 3mins into the vid
---
You can only hand in fresh data.
---
That would be awesome
---
You can only pick 1 up at a time. They dont stack. Think you can sell at a vendor for 1 cap each.
---
Hours fix vs minutes fix.
---
I am only at lvl 43 but did open a bunch at Primal Cuts I got via the seasons board.
---
I got one out of the rusty pick at level 20 the pie has been in my stash since and is now displayed on my shelf next to my nukashine
---
Not sure about your pc by my high-end system has no issues with ash piles.
---
My 2080 is generally bored to death with this game.
---
Clean AF! Love it!
---
Being a SS(and 1650) you will think it will at least allowing Targeting HUD/Recon sensors or the night-vision(don't think you can toggle it though) for the scout or aiming propose, but somehow it just for look, well, still cool though
---
I don‚Äôt
---
Yes actually. Some people rather have high health builds instead of bloody considering the damage difference
---
‚ÄúSneak snipe in power armor‚Äù
---
Thanks for the chuckle.
---
2500 hours and I've never had one
---
and their meat piles should have glowing flies
---
That‚Äôs really helpful thank you
---
Sorry man, PC
---
Thank you
---
Thanks, White wallpaper and a black brick type paper from the atom shop
---
They're the metal beams from the bottom of the stair section..
---
There‚Äôs none there normally
---
I think they renamed it crocollossus plushie and it should be in there Aug 31-sept 1
---
;)) Vault not Found
---
Thanks. Not yet I will try get on made
---
Chainsaws arent, you need both mods for it then it can kill a level 100+ player in 30 seconds if they are standing still.
---
Sure, i posted there too :)
---
Thanks
---
Yeah.  Put them in the trunk at the end.  Would be a nice bonus for actually escaping.
---
Depending on where you live, we could play together if you need any help.
---
Well I found 3 today in two servers sooo =\(-+-)/=
---
Edited to add, I‚Äôm NA west
---
You ever played the Witcher 3?  It's corpses are great.  Make them obvious
---
PST?
---
They don't take up that much tbh. I still have a little bit of budget left surprisingly. Helps placing camp where virtually no enemy spawns to save you using turrets
---
Yep yep!
---
I'm a fan of options.  8 notes verses 2 kits, take your pick.
---
You should be in bed, it's like, 2:30 here.
---
Or maybe a warning that it will be destroyed if you drop it, wait
---
Check out the ammo machine exploit and make an underground base to hide it, unfortunately at later games it's the only way to keep up without endless ammo farming.
---
I know, it‚Äôs also the weekend so figured I‚Äôd love it up
---
What's in the cranberry bog that gives acid?
---
[https://imgur.com/a/CH7EFRB](https://imgur.com/a/CH7EFRB)

Added my last two camps to give you some ideas :)
---
I like to stay and farm XP and screws from the horde of wendigos
---
Snallygasters
---
Come to think of it, I should probably go to sleep too. :)  goodnight.
---
I'm a huge believer in the seed theory and will definitely contribute to the rolls on my days off next week.
---
Honestly don‚Äôt rush to complete the ‚Äúmain quests‚Äù. Going at your own pace is best and is how I did it. 
---
One of the best things about Fallout is all the distractions and some can lead to fond memories. 
---
Also make sure you are scrapping all armor and weapons you don‚Äôt use anymore, you will find yourself needed those parts.
---
I don't think I've ever seen any there
---
Lol same I‚Äôm working on it
---
Well there is a long way to go my friend. Find a play style that you like and expand on it with perk cards. Maybe watch a couple you tubers to get a good grip on how to play (Angry turtle has good build guides and leveling up locations, Captainoob has great endgame builds and challenges...) I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll enjoy progressing through the main missions and the side ones too. A quick tip is to scrap your junk at a crafting table, drop mini nukes and missiles to reduce unused weight in stash. That‚Äôs it from me
---
Idk why they changed powerfists in 4 and 76 to not allow power armour at the same time such a shame.
---
They‚Äôve been a permanent spawn at the flooded trainyard for a while now
---
Got the mask few days ago with only 3 supplies. Couldnt find the dam 4th üòÜ
---
Method 1:
---
Do line in a sand event, gather and scrap scorched weapons. This would give you about 1000 steel.
---
Make rail nails with super duper and ammosmith as they require only steel. Dump nails to the ammo converter.
---
Get shatever you need from ammo converter. Repeat if need more.
---
Method 2:
---
Have a mutation serum receipe. Make serum(s), sell it to robot vendor - dependin on your charisma this gets upto 500 caps. Just buy lead, traders at whitespring usually have about 400 pieces, compensate caps waste with selling serum. Gunpowder and steel should not be a problem. So just craft whatever you need.
---
Don't carry junk on you is the number 1 rule for fallout
---
Fuck around and find out : claiming workshops
---
Maybe it's a working hypothesis requiring a massive increase in data points to form a sound scientific theory, with such a huge data base the RNG can call upon to produce crafted legendary items...  Item, \*rate, Prefix, Ability 1, 2, 3.  It would be next to impossible to prove the theory, but if enough players test and share data points, then the probability would be proved one way or the other.  
---
Personally I have "belief" that there is a grain of truth to this idea, purely from my own experiences with crafting ledgendary items, getting multiple Assassins, Zealots, Mutants, Vampires quite easily, and never yet having a Bloodied the RNG does not seem to be purely Random.
---
You can find one on the roof of West Tek Research Center. Regardless of luck.
---
Flooded trainyard yes, I go there all the time.  Never seen them in the mire though.
---
I‚Äôve definitely been breaking down all that I can and not getting too attached, stick with a pump, bolt rifle, two handed melee and that‚Äôs it
---
Yes please.
---
I misread your comment.  I thought you meant a specific spot called cranberry something in the bog, nvm
---
Phew!  Nearly scrapped my BE revolver yesterday for scrip.  Thanks for the info :)
---
What specifically?  Dying too much?  Damage, perks?
---
I actually will admit, the whole perks with cards are still a work in progress for me. I‚Äôll need to find a good vid as you said before I do too much damage lol. Thank you
---
Cave crickets at Tanagra town
---
I scrapped mine, I just dont pick up un needed ammo anymore and I bin ammo rewards.
---
Ludicrous.
---
Yep, I know.  I thought you said the cranberry glade, so I was confused
---
You said you‚Äôd never seen them in the mire so I explained the spot in the mire
---
The ivory grip?
---
Lvl 120 here, have also never dropped a nuke and don't know how. I finished the enclave questline, yet I don't recall ever dropping one. I think what happened was I was in a group and someone else did it. And I recall it being a huge pain to get through all the robots so haven't tried it since. Point is you're not alone.
---
It's probably just trash, tbh.
---
3,200? How is that even possible? That equates to like 6 months of playing the game constantly
---
I know.  I misconstrued mire for glade.  I've never seen them in the glade, which is a fast travel point.  That's what I meant to say.  There are some mirelurks there though.  That's why I was confused.  I thought you said they spawn at the glade.
---
How can you spend that long in a game with no content? We're you on pause?
---
You don‚Äôt lose any junk while inside Monongah Mine, or if you die while any event you‚Äôre attending is active.  You just respawn outside the mine and then the event ends.
---
Put your hazmat or chinese suit on your quickswap wheel.  I have mine set to the 9 key just in case I load into a nuke zone.  Problem solved.
---
Yep. But still nice thing to do. Free scrip
---
Aries and Rudy are so much better
---
Rifles don't really worth their weight unless you are in very specific builds, which is terrible weight to usability ration
---
"Free scrip" to me is meaningless.  Certainly not for other people though.  So yes, a nice gesture.
---
I got one within about 3 hours of playing. I thought they raised the chance, but nope.
---
Agree
---
Check your hdd status, internet status
---
I see. Thanks!
---
How do you mean? I have 84 stacked? (That sounds cheeky but I promise its not) haha
---
We need long arms that tear through the fabric of reality tooo.
---
Breast Implants- Increases your charisma,Greatly Increases Perception of Allies.
---
Yes you just have to complete enough dailes to accumulate friendly status with the settlers and allied with the raiders. Choices in the final quest can drop rep from 1 side, but it doesn't lock you out from earning back the rep through dailies
---
Trollderoll
---
Ah the good old pay to progress the main story gag I get it lol
---
Two shot is also just as fun. It has a bigger hit radius
---
720 hours, at least 4 pies from purveyor on each character. Why y‚Äôall skimping out on luck?, I always keep a set of unyielding on each character just for ammo crafting and boosting chances of super duper activating.
---
wut there is a chest in mine?!!!
---
If they will add a horse power armour at least in form of a ridable &lt;whatever that thing is called where you put your kid on, throw few cents in and run shopping while they enjoy the ride&gt;
---
Keep trying the machine and it'll eventually give you a pie. I never often get one first try. But congrats x
---
Take your time and enjoy the story, u will see lots of high levels about but once you hit 50 the amor and weps don't get higher. 
---
When doing the Wastelanders end quest prob best siding with settlers and giving them all the gold, it's very easy to farm gold tokens and in a week u should have enough for your first bit of amor, but grinding the xp takes months.
---
Start working on your backpack - head to the scout hut, this will take a while but totally worth the extra bag space
---
Get starched genes perk card and get yourself marsupial and speed demon mutations, better off buying them from player venders (approx 450 caps)
---
Fallout 1st is deffo worth it just for the scrapbox alone
---
More intelligence will grant more xp so don't be afraid to use them food and chem buffs
---
There are things called magic weapons which is where the legendary effects have bugged with certain combinations and give u one shot weps, check out guides
---
Always join a building group for xp boost
---
Use green thumb perk with farming plants and ammo Smith + super-duper when crafting ammo
---
It apparently happens if you‚Äôre playing through daily reset. It sucks to give up half an hour of playtime but log off around reset and you should avoid it
---
You can find more but if you've already got the quest active it won't renew, so it just pointlessly stacks. I wouldn't sell them as BoS content comes out soon and it might be used there.
---
You‚Äôll just have to find out.
---
You need to make a mule or two to unload all the extra.  Bring them up to lvl 50 during a double xp weekend, give them fixer/bear arm/whatever plans you‚Äôd like to get, bring them up to 1000 scrip and double or quintuple your chances to roll that weapon you want when there‚Äôs a Purveyor sale.  
---
I never throw away legendaries.  I just unload excess on mules once a week or so.  They all live at the Rusty Pick.
---
I think im about 400hrs in gameplay and have 7 left for sale.. I got mine in every diner. I sell them for 299 too!
---
FPS turns from solid 50 to solid 9
---
Not sure the precise details but you lose your sneak bonus if Earle is in combat with anyone, which would cost you about the same, if not more, damage.
---
Got 2 in a row at Camden park but none since. Ate 1 and sold the other.
---
After 4560+ hours I have quit.
---
Some tips for that is to make sure you have fireproof (Or dense on your armor dodgy, and serendipity equipped to take the damage for you
---
It would be funny to have a skin that will turn it into Contamination arch xD
---
I think it's an extra 100xp per level, so a level 300 would have to get 30k xp on top of level 1. I think that's how it works. It must suck for players at level 1000
---
Yes, i have both and the ending doesn't lock you out from the other faction
---
Very Nice ! I did not want to chose between these 2 rewards...!
---
Wow I feel lucky to have gotten it after only 200 hours then!
---
The stacked ones are worthless, except for selling to vendors for 1 cap each.
---
To trigger the quest, you need to loot a fresh Technical Data from a container. You can only hand in that one TD to finish the quest. Any additional TD you loot while the quest is active are of the useless 1-cap kind.
---
Drink. Some. Water
---
Let in pip boy or workbench to mark  regular armor parts , so that do not drop or scrap when in power armor.
---
Also save f@@ sort option for menu in pipboy when exit game. , every time I start the game I have to re-sort the weapons.
---
Have you tried bug spray?
---
The other day I was driving to the supermarket and some jackass tears out of a side street, causing me to slam on the brakes and nearly crash into the car in the left lane.  At the next light I pull up next to him and he tells me I need to learn to drive.  Some people are the stars of their own little universe.
---
It really was the perfect game for the era imo.
---
That guaranteed 3\* legendary is what I always thought should have been in the queen and sheep fight. I think all this new boss fight needs added to it is repair kit drop.
---
People occasionally sell them for around 10-15k caps. The only way to acquire them these days is as a rare (0.15% chance) bundle drop from all events in the Savage Divide.
---
Flat green and fairly empty
---
It needs an operation health like what rainbow six siege had. Although it‚Äôs time consuming, it basically fixed and set the fundamental foundation and underlying bugs for the better future.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ This is Gold
---
Oh i dont bother with sneak on melee, that goes out of the window after the first hit anyway.
---
‚ÄúGOOD DAY TO YOUUU‚Äù screaming in my ear
---
Of course it matters. I plan for shift rotation, by moving the time I play forward or backwards. I don‚Äôt know about score. The time should reset 20 hours after last use. Simple. And that‚Äôs why it is the way it is.üòâ
---
I got one when I was like lv20-30, didnt know it is that rare so I thrown it away lol.
---
Yeah but if you die after Earle dies and spawn outside when there's little time left, there's no escape
---
Bethesda, drop everything you‚Äôre working on.  Put a pin in the rest of the roadmap.  Word is that Joe doesn‚Äôt like the design of the spear, a weapon which no one cares about.  All hands on deck.
---
The world needs more homies like you.
---
And have it increase our perception for a while
---
I got another one yesterday. 10 total now. Maybe my 15 luck helps?
---
I‚Äôd never had one in any fallout. But since playing 76 I‚Äôve had 2!
---
Picked the game up for the first time since the end of 2018 due to lockdown (after wastelanders) and the game was far better. Sure there were still plenty of bsod's, crashes and awful lag but the world felt far more interactive and having a group of others to play with also helped.
---
Went back to work in August so don't get on as much anymore but now I'm playing through again with an alt but it's more of a solo game now!
---
Does losing a couple dozen screws and a piece of flux bother you that much?
---
it used to be where the cursed weapons where found on the PTS. but i guess they moved them to your inventory after the event ends due to some people not being able to escape in time
---
Ive sold pies before for like 40 caps, didn't know some people still hadn't got them
---
I think it's an impossible request because if they doing this, lots of people will stop buying the skins for the backpack and the jetpack on the atomic shop and they going to lose money.
---
Well done, I remember that feeling.yea you can get one of the roof but it's not the same as that moment you see that little old pie lift up in that claw then smoothly slide into the machine..then you hover over it to see that little fella show up in it ready to take.. Rule 32 - Enjoy the little things
---
Ah ok. So there aint any chance for special loot in that chest atm?
---
There's like 99.9% no point in leaving the mine, you're better off killing and looting all the wendigos
---
Appreciate your info thx üëç
---
It looks very modern i love it!
---
He can put what he wants, people need to start seening the difference between what BLM actually means and the political motives behind it. They are two different things.
---
You jinxed us!
---
I don't think so.
---
Twice now I've been killed by wendigos right when Earle is being finished off, I get ported out and can't get back in to loot his body. Infuriating for such a pita fight.
---
wait...
---
I must admit, some of the days where I‚Äôd otherwise be moping around my house, dwelling on my problems, I spent playing this game, not dwelling on my problems.
---
I‚Äôll be talking about this game in 20 years.
---
Just. Add. Sliders.
---
The chest usually has like 150 caps and a handful of stims.  Now, I just stay in the mine and recoup some ammo off the wendigo I killed.
---
Right? Speaking of that I finally got one Monday lol. Finally amongst the fallout gods.
---
So a 1-1 isn‚Äôt fair but a 4-1 is?
---
I don't have the plan anymore but I can mod them for you. Just need the flux and I can cover the rest no problem. Unless of course it's strangler heart then you're on your own :p
---
I feel bad in saying that I got the game a month ago and have two pies displayed after getting both this week...
---
Yeah but honestly it worth even more a video...
---
I understand your pain &amp; agree with you 100%. Its why I don't trust level 400s or so.
---
When the fight takes for like 20 minutes, we be talking about hundreds of screws and acids. That ain't a joke
---
But the collapsing tunnels and explosions are much more exciting!! Seriously, I love timing it and trying to get out before the last second; besides I have so many screws already.
---
Absolutely. I picked 76 up in the end of February from the second hand entertainment store for ¬£8, not expecting to get much out of it. 
---
Then lockdown started  and it's been a great distraction. I'm probably 400 hours into it now.
---
I‚Äôm going to guess I was about that many hour when I got my first pie too. Then I got two more soon after and now months have passed without any more.
---
Sorry new whats ACP ?
---
nope, no matter how hard you try. you cannot be Mothy enough for them
---
Yes once attacker and owner are both together in the zone your both in pvp regardless of whether one or both leave. 
---
For the challenge to save time and effort. Look at what the challenge needs and as it repeats build a blueprint of the challenge itself. Badda bing badda boom challenge done in seconds from now on.
---
Spear has the best animation in my opinion
---
I get them a fair bit in this game, had 2 in a row a few months ago, 1st try on 2 different machines in the same play session about 5 mins apart
---
Its not much but sell the technical data to a NPC vendor for 1 cap.
---
A collosal problem (new event)
---
I'd love to be able to farm them for mutt chops üëç Some new recipes like pupperooni pizza would also be cool.
---
I did
---
Not really, as pointed out before, it *used* to have the cursed weapons in it. But now you have a chance to gain these at the completion of the Colossal Problem randomly. It's better to shoot the Wendigo spawn occasionally when you get feared by Earle, and collect their scrap after he goes down. Coming out of the mine with 200 screws isn't unheard of, just be careful you don't get hit by the roof when it crumbles around you.
---
darn haha! i guess i‚Äôll just have to try harder
---
The concept is, the fact they are mostly against ALM as a statement kinda implies the opposite. I feel the problem is it was started with the best of intention to try and fix a wrong but it‚Äôs just helped to encourage a victim mentally. I‚Äôm all for equality in all aspects of life but not this bullshit thing where people seem to want extras.
---
Yup these were my thoughts too but wasnt sure if you can obtain something special from the chest
---
The locked room at the entrance gets exploded open when you run out, there is a red steamer trunk in there, usually contains anywhere from 25-500 caps and some stimpacks and ore.
---
someone on my server is selling some in their vendor for 500 caps. 
---
GT: rammadeus. their camp is NE of vault 76.
---
The spawn on top of WestTek should be removed tbh.
---
At some point it‚Äôs on you not to die.  They already changed it so you don‚Äôt lose anything while attending an event.  If you know you‚Äôre going to spawn into a nuke zone, put on a hazmat suit before leaving.  If you don‚Äôt like the consequences of death, try to be proactive about staying alive.
---
Damnnnnn alright then üòÖ love a good roast tho
---
Personally, if the unarmed weapon category wasn‚Äôt blatantly superior for melee, I wouldn‚Äôt use it. 
---
I‚Äôd like to see some power armor unarmed weapons if nothing else for the sheer cool factor. I‚Äôm personally not a fan of Power Armor, but I‚Äôd like to see more people use it rather than the current automatic/heavy gun meta (not that those are bad).
---
Definitely me too. When people bring up the 'Rona virus I'll always remembers smashing out F76 while it was happening and shaking my head at every toilet roll I saw in-game.
---
Would be nice if 6-8 pieces could be converted to a full pie with like +5 to all stats. Those things would sell for so much lol.
---
This shows how little to do in fallout 76 end game that all these people with 1000s of hours get excited about getting a pie üòÇ (not dissing you guys im dissing the game) I wouldnt sit there and get one
---
Does the event still complete properly? I know it didn't the first two times when i fast traveled out.
---
Fuck I sincerely hope not....
---
(*Crawls into Pulowski Preservation Shelter*)
---
(Not sure I spelt that right.....)
---
Covid-cola, my bloods in it !
---
The cursed weapons used to be available from the chest, but now it seems that it only has a few caps, stims and ore.  Not worth the trouble.
---
Cooked Glowing Meat in a can. I'd carry a ton of them.
---
That's funny, that the myth turned out to be true.
---
He could be an alien? The Flatwoods Monster is clearly a Zetan variant of some description, so they may have arrived on the same ship.
---
is your name mud?
---
Low key
---
But.. any scientific hypothesis is belief until validated or dismissed
---
Try to get B/33/25 plasma caster to kill trash mobs, don‚Äôt use a PA
---
For bossing, .50 cal, faster fire rate since bosses resist explosives.
---
You will be spending 3 or 4 times more ammo tho
---
I started playing again about a month ago now, I played for a few weeks after it came out but stopped because of life stuff. Since I started playing, half way through I started keeping a journal, and would right down every game breaking bug or needed fix I'd I encountered the problem over 3 times. I'm about 30 some odd pages in. It's an absolute mess, and after being such a huge fan for years, I just can't bring myself to defend them anymore. Its embarrassing for a company that large to have this many issues
---
There's a chest?
---
Who said the wasteland was fair? I meant 1 person attacks u and your team mates help defend u. Its the attackers choice!
---
I'm fully aware of that and that's what this post is all about. Why so actively try to kill players when the fight is over? The fact you have to prepare for death after the fight is something I don't have to deal with in most other games
---
I may be downvoted for this. And I understand. 
---
But I think I do the pvp for fun :) 
---
I‚Äôm a pvp build because that‚Äôs all i could think of to do after completing all the main missions. 
---
Here‚Äôs how I roll:
---
I find people who are way above my level so maybe they have a chance.
---
I shoot them once and if they shoot back then we do some pvp. 
---
If they put the thumbs down or look away I go away n leave em :) 
---
If the person does fight me, I do pvp and at the end I give them some quantum‚Äôs or ammo as compensation:) 
---
Is this all fair? I don‚Äôt wanna be a toxic pvper :(
---
That is my current personal quest, unbelievably rare drop..! But one day I will have max carry on my strangler
---
I've often thought the Legendary glow should remain permanently, but then I remember people would throw a fit because it wouldn't be immersive enough or that it would be lore breaking.
---
Damage reduction
---
I always spam E. Space and Enter in a sort of rhythmic dance. It gives exp. If they add sliders to mass cook i can imagine they lower the exp gain even more
---
Most people don't even have one
---
Is that worth it though? You can get like 30-40 shots of your ammo type and hundreds of screws, stimpaks and purified water from the Wendigos
---
If your on PC theres a mod on nexus that reskins them to NW dufflebags for easier looting
---
The game is pretty solid now. The community is even better üíö
---
My head canon is that I am the one true prophet of mothman and the cultists are all false and that is why I have to kill them. Until They become a true faction and I can be friendly with them, that is just how it has to be.
---
repair kits
---
Rare &amp; if you equip the salt mod make sure to display that weapon on a camp wall.  It has its own display animation when looking at it - I won‚Äôt spoil it and say what it does. :)
---
damn i done colossal like 15 times and never go for the chest :(
---
I had this happen to me once but I had last laugh and  nukegrenades on me
---
no no. event reward like SBQ
---
I tried my hand at 32 modules earlier this week. 4 attempts on the left arm got me an unyielding.
---
28 attempts on the right arm got me neither an unyielding, mutant, or bolstering. It is what it is. However, I did get 6 Life Saving and 4 Chameleon right arms. 10 out of 28 were two variants. Odd to say the least. Statistically unlikely to be more accurate.
---
[rng](https://i.imgur.com/ck97IyO.png)
---
I'm going to craft some more tomorrow. I'll track it more closely. Your theory that there are pools would resonant with what I saw in my first batch of crafts.
---
I got one on the FIRST Port-A-Diner I tried, then never again (800 hours later)! I actually saved the clip of it happening cos I was so used to not ever having one work in FO4. Then when I didn‚Äôt get any more, I assumed it was a joke that you only get one on your first try! It‚Äôs only in the last few months that I‚Äôve realised that‚Äôs not true!
---
I used unyielding armor to get the pie, takes me about 11 tries every time at any port a diner
---
Sure there is no real RNG in hardware/software. Everything is deterministic. But the randomness of a seed is quite consistant (usually based on time in Micro sec, so it's always moving).
---
The game data are clear: all mod have the same chance to proc.
---
Everything else is just a story to feel better when you are out of luck ;)
---
Praise the lord and pass the ammunition. I like that.
---
Still need help? I sent a request - Zaddicus
---
Mods on fo76?
---
Considering how this game is out for a 2nd year and almost 3rd year nothing surprises me anymore
---
I don‚Äôt play anymore, stopped about 2 months ago. But when I was playing everyone had legacies and duped B2525 fixers. Was the whole reason I quit tbh
---
Aren't these type of data in the code? Can't dataminer look at them like they look at event drop chances and similar?
---
Yeah theres some mods for it, not much in the way of drastic changes but theres things like inventory sorters, perk loadouts, glowing ore deposits, re skins of things, different maps
---
I was pretty bummed when I found out the Captain Cosmos jetpack was for power armor. I'd love some better skins for the jets, or a backpack with jets. Most packs look horrid with the jetpack. I fibally settled on the Corvega pack since it has the lowest profile,  and is sleeker in form.
---
it will tell you. you cannot miss it. so once you get the first one go to the other side and do the quests until you get that one and then choose a side
---
What if it was just a mod to unarmed weapons that made them pa usable but unusable without? Lorewise it makes it so it bolts on but then can't be handheld
---
I don't think so. I doubt Bethesda would give "missed" quest rewards to players.
---
They fixed the graphics,and adjusted the coin system to a point where only 60%(I guess this) of players don't like it,instead of pure 100%. It should be ready to be released. I really hope they come with the daily ops in patch 22.
---
Something glowing from radiation while alive *should* glow when dead! I don't think that an argument of "breaks immersion" would hold up in Fallout court.
---
I only noticed recently that her machine has grenades on some of the lower dishes.
---
It will literally pop up in a box and tell you before you decide. Just get both factions quests to that point &amp; you're good to make your choice.
---
Meat piles are per client. Just make goo and ash the same.
---
Hell, make ALL corpses the same.  No items for your character to get? Delete corpse from rendering on your client.
---
About 3000 hours and I finally got it Monday in Flatwoods.
---
They Will Always Attack You despite You have a cultist suit on.
---
I bought every plan as well. as all the mutation serum recipes. I bought all that the npcs and bots have to sell. and I completed it in february. I‚Äôve been buying ammo since then. 556 and 45. 1cap each. I have 250k 45 and 185k 556. and I run with an automatic fixer and an auto handmade. I dont know where to spend my caps
---
Considering legendary scorched are very rare I find that hard to believe
---
Reminds me of when I referred to STD in r/startrek ü§î
---
Unfortunatly we eventually get used to it. When i start to get too frustrated, i understand i need to take a break and go try something else.
---
But i would just like they could at least fix the damn framedrops. This is mostly what ruins my experience. I'm as worried as excited about the addition of "Daily Ops". Something tells me that's its gonna be aweful for the eyes...
---
Awesome, thanks. üëçüèª
---
Wanted to be sure you know?
---
Cool i did not know that. I thought, it being an online game, I couldn't change the game files.
---
How...Pleasant üòâ Valley
---
Better yet add something else to 1st and give the scrapbox to everyone.
---
We can only dream about sliders.
---
I'd be all over a Trickster skin. Going around pranking players.
---
Nice, Danke sch√∂n. I assume a big box that take up most of the screen that says ‚ÄúTHIS IS THE POINT OF NO RETURN‚Äù?
---
I thought the code was already full of lolcats.
---
The problem of whitespring are the nukes, the griefer and all the High level enemy that usually Spawn, and near the Snake icon there is a good spot Always full of Camp so You Need to change server much time
---
Yea most random cargo bot drops are from players who use A supply requisition, so generally they belong to someone.
---
Started playing the day Wastelanders came out. First vending machine I came across was selling a toilet roll for 50,000 caps.
---
Theres some things you can change so its not as intense modding as say fo4, but you can mod some stuff, you wont be able to lay nuclear winter while theyre active though
---
Don't like the lightning, less focused than a clean miner hat that gives a better atmosphere in dark places.  
---
I've bought out from 1000 than resell it for 2000, still fair, when the event granted me one more.
---
Yep! Seriously, you won't miss it. Just take each faction's quests up to that point, then choose either üôÇ
---
So I pull out my Beretta....
---
Bethesda do have some 'splainin to do! I done the same thing with a piece of armour I had with a skin on and there was absolutely ZERO warning this would happen! https://imgur.com/IY9E6EM
---
The Hunter‚Äôs Long Coat isn‚Äôt bad.
---
With West Virginia no, but every city has a "welcome to grafton" or similiar, but if You want the west Virginia sign You can do it with letters at your Camp
---
You‚Äôd be the one guy to actually survive in one of those. Lucky Bastard!
---
It has completed properly every time that I have run it (probably about once a day since it dropped). 
---
I also run to the top. It is a much more dramatic ending :)
---
That's actually pretty normal, the only real difference is probably less people hunting them so higher availability in the wild. 
---
People are momentarily distracted with Collosal problem or trying to rush through catching up on score.
---
It's an Under Armor not an outfit. You gotta unlock those mods bro...
---
One fishes for fish but does one fish for fishes? Stay tuned.....
---
Hum, i was going to sell a good gamma gun, now i'm gonna keep it in case of i want to troll a troll.
---
Can't you request them from Modus?
---
Yeah but where can I unlock it? And are those mods specific to the secret service underarmor?
---
I actually thought there would be one towards the end of this legendary run. It's quite common in games with battle pass type systems to have XP events towards the end for people to catch up. I'll still hold out hope.
---
Add another character slot and I will continue to not give a shit.
---
Would be cool to see fishing poles made into something you can use and not just scrap
---
I dont want to set the world on fire...
---
All of the above, but it‚Äôs treasury notes. Not bullion directly.
---
If someone goes through and shoots all the turrets, they stay smashed until the server is rebooted. If you hack the terminals the turrets turn back on for the next run.
---
I usually hack the terminals then smash the turrets in the final room while waiting for it to complete.
---
Also if you initialize the launch process then fast travel away, you often can run back in and it's ready to launch.
---
Nope the first time i looted this chest i was unhappy it's a wast to try to run through the mine just for some ore and caps when you can get back ultracite ammo, screws/junk and aids
---
Gotcha, thanks! ü§ô
---
"Non copyright version starts playing"*
---
Ultracite gatling laser with power user. No cheating required....
---
I can assure you you do not loose your sneak bonus just because he's attacking someone else. I'm able to keep mine no problem while he's attacking everything and using his scream attack that scares them away
---
There is a gym with lots of lead. But a solo player should be able to run though a silo with only 1 or 2 stims in PA. I do it with a bloodied grognak axe. Hack the terminals, pick locks, 15 min effort. Or glitch through the storage door for a shortcut. It's easier solo than on a team.
---
Nothing confirmed yet,but i'd like one as well during the cool down time between seasons.
---
Use nukacrypt to get codes every week.
---
Funny thing, the BOS Underarmors were MADE to fit under Combat Armor or Power Armor. So I would make perfect sense if we could wear it in power armor.
---
I like it whenever the engine does something like that, invoking a location randomizer. ;-) I've clicked on several forest horde events like that, only to find myself loaded into that building in Watoga with all the turrets and robots inside. Must be fun if it happens to a low level player...
---
I came across a camp that as two rows of 1x1 foundation rooms with only 3 walls and a fence. 
---
Now inside each room (about ten of them) were different handmade scenarios filled with bunnies. 
---
There was President Bunny, Mothman Bunnies, Tadpole Scout Bunnies even one marked Ted Bunndy and depicted an execution by electric chair haha also stripper bunnies bathed in a red light. 
---
I couldn't help but look around for ages.
---
This game helped me get through the monotonous boredom.
---
In a way it brought some structure back in to my life.
---
Grinding out resources for ammunition etc.
---
Not everybody Cup of Tea, for sure.
---
But this is Fallout,a bit like Marmite,you will either love it,or hate it.
---
I just want to start
---
a flame in earle's heart
---
Back when the game came out I bought it first week and started playing and got it on the first machine. Ate it btw. Big sad.
---
Probably also the reason Ward now hides in his trailer while she loiters across from it.
---
I had my camp there for ages but got annoyed with having to server jump to place my camp so moved up near the raider camp for the lead and junk deposits just south but its hilly and already annoying me lol.
---
Thats not the issue here, i deal the same damage before and after Nukashine, as it dosnt work.
---
I recorder myself partaking in radiation rumble (on ps4) the lagg was so heavy, we failed the event unable to keep the scavengers alive... I had done the event before but now it was lagging so badly bc of all the dead bodies and piles...
---
I feel this. I've had the game for awhile but didn't play much - I've been in off and on lockdown since February. Still in it right now. 
---
Between fallout and animal crossing it's weirdly helped me keep a routine everyday lol 
---
The boardgame helps even more cause it appeals to my achievement hunting haha ......
---
not exactly hard to get them though is it
---
The best part is that I went through all of Maggie's dialogue aside from all the completion choices and she retains her mood throughout. It's only that one question that gets her freaking out like it just happened rather than over 20 years ago. It's like Beth had her do some dramatic at the end of recording, but forgot to backtrack and have some transition with her delivery. Someone there probably enjoyed the take and put it in and so the emotional shift is so instant that it feels like whiplash.
---
Me: I have 384 bullets
---
Ammo Converter: I'll give you 300 points for 300 bullets
---
Me: OK I'll have 84 bullets left
---
Ammo Converter: transaction failed, insufficient ammo
---
Me:???
---
Me: 2 bullets left
---
Me: wtf!?!?!?
---
They do, u just didn‚Äôt read the message!!!!
---
GODD MORNING! MOTHMAN CALLING! HAVE YOU SEEN THIS AWSOME LAMP!
---
Do griefers seriously still regularly show up there?
---
Depends on your build. It‚Äôs very tedious for my sniper. Not hard, but tedious.
---
Hold B
---
Do you even keep the two flux?
---
I need them. I really, really need them.
---
My hoard only exceeds zero because I inevitability get overtaken in the silo by someone glitching their way through. 
---
And they weigh too much. You won't believe this but I'm actually ovencumbered AF........
---
So many loading screens though go bunker, get mission chase down for 1, server hop. All these people who show up to the event though should show their nuclear keycard appreciation ;)
---
If i can take them down with a shotgun i am sure you could manage
---
Yeah I pretty much hate all the terrain outside of the golf course
---
They have concept art of players mutating into super mutants or giant walking mole rats. They definitely played with the idea if players changing, like werewolves or vampires in elder scrolls.
---
They probably had to just settle for the mutations for whatever reason though.
---
Please add more songs. That is all. I have spoken.
---
I love this post. I‚Äôve been fighting on the front lines in the icu but have read of all the fun and exploits this year through these posts. 
---
I would add one important detail. To those who reside in the US of A, VOTE!!!  It‚Äôs time to make sure all our voices are heard. And get 10 friends to vote too!!  This did not have to be so bad. Other places had their lock down and are finished. 
---
That is all.
---
What a wholesome interaction this was ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
They would be in the server code, not the client code, and so the dataminers won't have access to that.
---
Same for me (ps4)
---
Oh yea, since the Chicken Coop is 100% not only a cosmetic item. We all need that poop to grind the real endgame. Also there is no Free option for getting poop in the game. 
---
Honestly and without sarcasm: The chicken Coop is a Perfect example for an item that should *not* be available for everyone later. It is basically the reason why many people bothered to do the daily challenges at all. If items like these are to be bought anyways later - might also skip season 2.
---
A filet mignon heart
---
I agree, I hate having to bust out the camera to scan the field of corpses in order to find the legendary worth looting.
---
I give my nuclear keycards to people who want to launch a nuke
---
oh yh that's true
---
Exactly and sorry for wait. Reddit app and website are bugging on ne right now. 
---
~~grind~~ time is correct. There is nothing to grind in this game since everything is capped or limited :)
---
You literally had to agree on a window that pops up to delete the weapon and you're calling Beth morons? Lol
---
[Sure thing. That must be it. ](https://giphy.com/gifs/bobs-burgers-l0HlIbzTDGWY0ySly)
---
I don't think 1/20 of the nukes would be dropped.
---
I have posted original idea of this a week ago:
---
/r/fo76/comments/iezue7/friendly_reminder_rifles_is_the_only_weapon_type/
---
Who will post it next week?
---
I only ever got one in Fallout 4. One day, one day... I will achieve that perfectly preserved pie in 76...
---
I never use it at events as cause of the chain you can kill things quite quickly without realising it.
---
Wait what?!? This is news to me üòÇ
---
TUNA'd?
---
Chest had caps and junk for me so I don‚Äôt even bother anymore. I stay down below until I die and that‚Äôs it. First two events I was mad I didn‚Äôt get the chest because I thought I was missing something. Then next couple events I got to get the chest and it‚Äôs worthless. I rather have the junk and ammo
---
I got mine on Friday in Flatwoods.
---
Was literally joking with my friend that he could try it after me, when I turned back to the port-a-diner, the claw was pulling up the pie and I legit screamed ‚ÄúHoly shit! I got it!!‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
no no. chest
---
Ha, I'm a hoarder, think i have over 100 now.
---
... and nukashine
---
Is it Roach - Shadow Legend?
---
Yea I think so too but have limited my testing to SS armor
---
nuka...cola...
---
"Captain Cosmos Bundle" is rank 100 and only rank 100
---
I agree. Too bad the other "spear" in game is a makeshift spear with a combat knife that you can add to the pool stick. Too bad it uses the bash animation instead of stab animation too...

For all your concerns regarding patch 22 and 23, here's a quick Gamecon 2020 DEV interview highlights. 
---
https://youtu.be/g8UG_b7JsBk
---
Good luck. Three months ago I had some on me being I use to find them everywhere. I went over and turned some in. After that one turn in have not found a single piece of data since then. Ppl act like i don‚Äôt know how to find it but I‚Äôm telling you for three months I have not found a piece of data and I know I use to have so much of it before. I don‚Äôt know how to ever get it to fix itself
---
Wow I'll have to sort the effects properly since they're in the wrong order but it's a good sample size. I wish I'd done that sooner
---
I was fine might be a local thing
---
Happened to me twice last night and I did not get event completion. One time I was removed from the instance. The other time I was ported outside of The Ski Resort way to the south.
---
That's an old link that's never been accurate. OP, you can use the S.C.O.R.E. progression calculator that akarnokd created to find out exactly how much XP you need to get from one level to the next. The amount you need increases every level.
---
Just type in your current level and it will tell you what you need.
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html
---
XD dammnn why lol
---
Maybe let marine armor live up to its title and let it use stabilized? And maybe even include the secret service armor for you rich people.
---
Saying that I do feel remorse for lower levels so I don't target them, I only fight people who PvP and know what they are doing, yesterday, someone on reddit with a PvP build asked people to fight them and I knew I would lose but I enjoyed it cause I complimented his build and he said I was a bullet sponge, I learnt from the expirience but I also like to defend people whos workshops get nicked from tryhards, one time a level 20 was enjoying themself at the junk yard and a level 400 comes along in his PA and legacy plasma, he has no chance, as soon as he claimed it I sprung and tryharded on the level 400 and the tesla came out, assassin sentinel came on and teamed up with the level 20, after the 400 screwed off I built the workshop up with extractors, crafting stations, turrets, traps and switched server.
---
Or you on PS4? Looks like there's a PSN outage this morning
---
Yes please. Also if we could loot it with having to deal a certain amount of damage that would rock
---
That would be awesome!
---
TDs can replicate themselves for some reason. Sell the ones that you have right now. If you want a fresh one, go to the military wing of the Enclave bunker and search the desks.
---
Lol. Lame.
---
I did over three months ago I sold everyone I had left and have not found any since then. I keep trying everyday since then
---
more songs are a definite must
---
If you run and launch all 3 silos on a public server then jump to a private server and try it again straight afterwards it will still let you run the silos, as they have fresh nukes in but you are on a personal cool down that the silo holotape doesnt tell you. 
---
So you can get all the way to the end put a keycard in only for the targeting computer to deny you access until your personal cool down completes, it doesnt give you the time at the start like the holotape does for the rebuilding of the nuke you have to wait until you interact with the targeting computer right at the end.
---
I collected loads in hope of grinding the wendingo colossus. However I think the event is a huge disappointment so I havnt launched a nuke since its dropped
---
Yeah, once me and a friend found one, we are good sports so we went in, he died and the dude became wanted and he was so confused and he asked me to kill him so I did and I wont lie it was a good trap camp, he had thought about itüòÇüòÇ It's stupid how a trap can give you a bounty
---
Keep a melee weapon for low level stuff like ghouls, roaches, etc. Find a railway rifle. The ammo only requires steel.
---
It should be free then I wouldn't have to pay for fall out 1st anymore.
---
It's basically the only reason why I still have fo 1st.
---
As long as that certain amount of damage is ‚Äò1 point or greater‚Äô then there shouldn‚Äôt be any issue.
---
Fair enough. What is it that disappoints by the way?
---
Do it again. Because your ‚Äòbug‚Äô is an extremely rare one.
---
Cant they just allow them to kill the person and just leave? I never use workshops cause of the PvP risk, I just make caps, buy bulk, done. Quicker, no PvP, risk free, easy
---
I always keep 10 for myself and sell the rest. Since my camp is close to a vertibot path I get way more cards than I can use.
---
Again I‚Äôm getting told I‚Äôm not doing it right. I‚Äôve played since beta but for some reason ppl think I‚Äôm making it up. Good thing a rare one I mean oh my god I‚Äôm so glad everyone experiences the same bugs in this game. Thank god I have reddit to tell me that I‚Äôm not doing it right. What shall I do?!?
---
Go up to the very top of west tec there‚Äôs a pie that spawns there. YW
---
If only it were. It's more than that though. You can deal a few hundred to scorchbeast queen and get nothing.
---
Naturally Aspirated West?
---
Firefly‚Äôs
---
Yeah it's Insane, I stopped playing before the NBC update and felt like I wasted my money (I've been playing Fallout since 3) but since COVID I've actually been having a lot of fun with the game, I still probably prefer the single player games like 3, NV and 4 (sorry everyone) but I'm absolutely loving the game anyway.
---
Colossus looks like is best one now bcz of guaranteed 3star rewards
---
You can‚Äôt use vendor ones either
---
What level?
---
25
---
You know what would be cool for the personal terminal? A flux map!
---
Got couple paragraphs in and realized it kept going. Woah, thats a lotta words. To tired to read all of it mate, but sounded cool. Imma go to bed now.
---
I didn‚Äôt say you were doing it wrong. I said to do it again. 
---
That‚Äôs how an intermittent bug is fixed. Sometimes you have to try the solution more then once.  
---
You‚Äôve got a huge chip on your shoulder.  I‚Äôm simply trying to help. 
---
Best of luck, kid. See ya in the Wasteland.
---
99,9% yes. Magic. 
---
I also tend to assume that magic effect is hidden secret furious effect. 
---
Focusing of fire on point from 200+ weapon (from known list) should bring stunning damage
---
Damn
---
So you want it?
---
I never thought of this. It‚Äôs a great idea! Agree that you shouldn‚Äôt have to do it though.
---
I‚Äôm aware of that. IIRC the threshold is 3000.  
---
Perhaps for event bosses the threshold needs to be ‚Äò1%‚Äô, to at least encourage a modicum of participation.
---
Sorry if you where actually trying to help. But for some reason I‚Äôve made this post months ago and everyone comes off as if I‚Äôm lying or not doing it right. But you must‚Äôve misread what I wrote I‚Äôve done it everyday since I last dropped off and it never shows up the quest never pops and for argument sake I actually just went through the bunker just now and again no data at all. But again I‚Äôm sorry.
---
It's amazing how coronavirus and a good community can elevate a barely functioning 5/10 at most game to actually being worth playing. These developers got lucky that they can get away with the shit they do.
---
I had this the other day and was cursing Bethesda ... then I found that a router reboot fixed it ..
---
Have you dropped or sold all of the technical data in your inventory?  Have you gone to the cache to try to turn one in, *without* any in your inventory?
---
Have you put in a trouble ticket with Bethesda?
---
&gt;I was hoping that 76 would be one that avoided that.
---
No chance, it's in every game. Which is not a bad thing. There is multiple sides in a playerbase.
---
Here ya go: https://youtu.be/w29Bz12ZL5E
---
Jesus turn your quests off.
---
This is incredible. I've wanted to do a more contemporary styled camp, and continue to be amazed they have no CAMP components which even go with a midcentury modern look (other than a few pieces of furniture). Your images have inspired me to give this a try and see how well it works out on console.
---
I turned what I had three months ago. Only could sell the 15 I had another 15. I noticed it was bug so I sold rest to vendor. And since then I can find any or get quest to pop up. I‚Äôm now putting in a ticket. I don‚Äôt know what happened I use to find data everywhere I mean everywhere. So it‚Äôs just weird it is no where to find for me.
---
I'm weird but for some reason I like the quest that pops up when you clear a silo to launch a nuke, I don't know why, it's just a routine mainly, but I like it, especially that feeling and you finish launch prep, the panel is waiting for you, you enter the code and here it is, the world went silent and everything awaits for your decision what spot on the map to purge with radioactive fire. I also like it when my name is announced for the whole server to thank or curse me for that nuke xD
---
Never bothered with any of that. I just shoot down any I see in the wild. They used to regularlly fly over my old camp site for a while. Theres often one around Watoga and Ive seen them over Palace of the Winding Path 
---
If it flies it dies.
---
More songs, but please keep it so everyone in lobby hears the same music. Pretty nice when you get the whole party doing karaoke.
---
I agree its partially why I started playing.
---
I know what you mean I too wish somethings were more detailed but honestly they can‚Äôt even fix bugs thatve been in the game for 2+ years while having a PTS which is to avoid those problems and it‚Äôs not like they don‚Äôt know about them either
---
I tested this. Lost all my junk when the mine collapsed. No screws retained.
---
This doesn't always work, as I've seen legendaries drop the "legendary" name after death!
---
Look on mine https://imgur.com/gallery/FYItT7d

Animal Crossing: Wastelanders Edition.
---
Xbox
---
I'll try that thanks
---
Don't get me wrong the idea is great, it seems to run smooth enough and having the new scare scream attack thing is great but it is no where near challenging enough, it is just another bullet sponge boss. I was hoping it would have something more like encrypted. It should take tactics not resources to defeat big enemies
---
I've used 70+ in the last month.
---
not that it matters as it's been fixed on the PTS apparently
---
Nono. Event reward. Pleaseplease. ilootwendigos.
---
What Armour are you running?  Got a piece with the ‚Äòmagic‚Äô shotgun effect? What about AP refresh?
---
Don't mean it in a rude way but what is it to you? I mean how do you know someone has a lot of them? They weigh 1 pound each so it doesn't even make sense to keep a lot, especially for people who don't have fallout 1st, every bit of free weight counts. Even if they do have a lot of them, that's their choice what to hoard, maybe they're saving them for a friend/team, maybe they plan a marathon of nukes, you never know.
---
Same, came up with the outfit combination on my own and the first time I went out wearing it there was at least 3 people at once at Meat Week wearing the Reclaimed Deep Mining Helmet and Insurgent outfit...
---
Looks kinda good with the Quack Doctor Outfit.
---
I just hate that I can carry 100 more units of weight when I'm *not* wearing power armor.
---
I'm still trying to figure out the immortal placeholders like headless ghouls and scorched or robobrains and mothmen that can't be killed.
---
Australia is day to day back and forward with lock downs so it's still ongoing here.
---
Thank you for what you're doing also.
---
explosive or vats hit tesla rifles for pvp HAHAHAHA

I can help if you still need. Wicked_Thicc is my IGN.

*THE FIXER HAS ENTERED THE CHAT*
---
I love Uranium Fever the most. I'm really looking forward to One Wasteland so the rewards will scale. I just love killing those big old grumpy mole miners and getting all that sweet, sweet loot.
---
How do u black out your comment like that
---
Thank you!  [https://imgur.com/a/CH7EFRB](https://imgur.com/a/CH7EFRB) 
---
My two other camps for some more ideas :)
---
Not yet afaik
---
I suppose yes. Theres a terminal where you can trigger a quest to shoot down these crates with the nuclear keycards. I think its even repeatable. Im not exactly sure what Terminal tho, need to look it up.
---
My character is not a big dmg build. The person I play with is a stealth sniper, so my character is built to tank. I use a vampire Gatling gun and a vampire gauss minigun. My first time doing the event, I only died once near the end of the timer and what did the most damage to me was the environment. I basically walked backwards dragging the pack of baby wendigos around killing them off while everyone else was shooting Earle.
---
Can only do 1 at a time. Anything else in your inventory is essentially spoiled and will not work
---
Me just whining XD  getting a bit monotonous going in and out of the bunker to chase down 1 carrier then server hopping to rinse repeat, just wish there was easier access to modus
---
Sorry if it's too long man i just wanted to give a more complete picture where things are somewhat balanced for each other making a better experience to be a crafter and make consumables while giving it long term goals such as pets. 
---
Things other online games have that motivate players to play everyday since it seems that's what the devs want even though they don't add the content for it.
---
Ye, I have been working on a better solution to that at the moment (software dev by trade)
---
If somebody already launched a nuke from a certain site. And I head over there, when I try to sue the elevator to go down there and use te hand scanner. It won‚Äôt let me. It will turn red and say that there‚Äôs a cool down period. 
---
That has always happened for me. So I just go to a different silo. 
---
Also I suggest you buy the holotape ‚Äúmissile silo tape‚Äù
---
I don‚Äôt remember if you get it from the enclave at white springs. (You can always google it) 
---
But basically that holotape will have the name of the 3 silos in your current lobby. Along with their status and how much time you have to wait in real life for you to be able to launch a nuke.

---
We all feel your pain buddy trust me
---
I know what you mean, I go through 5mm a lot but I'm hoping the new legendar ammo perk eases that up
---
I watched a video just a bit ago discussing ‚Äúmagic‚Äù guns in FO76... not just any legendary.
---
Apparently the weapon system is more broken than I realized, and some weapons with specific fire rates and/or specific legendary bonuses as well as some armors with specific legendary bonuses literally break the game.
---
Among the demonstrations show was a Mini-gun that was doing about 20 damage per shot to the SBQ, yet managed to nearly kill it in a single landing phase... solo.
---
If I remember, I‚Äôll past the video.
---
I'm so sick of my shotgun breaking mid fight
---
Sometimes meat piles don't vanish too!
---
Ah okay xD Well I once got lucky, my camp was often being visited by vertibots with that chest, so I shot them and got set for a while. I don't launch nukes that often, so I'm still using those i got from that time, also sold a few. I didn't know better and sold them for 999 and someone actually bought it xD I saw them for 200 caps then I was like oopsie.
---
That would be great if they didn't sink below the ground.
---
I'm settler Doug Llewellyn and this is Fallout Court, with super mutant Judge Joseph Wapner and ghoul bailiff Rusty Burrell. Tonight's case: should legendary monsters glow after death? Let's see how the wastelanders at home decided- it appears yes, overwhelmingly you've agreed, yes they should!
---
I run a max Luck build, eat plenty of Venison with Berries, and hit those machines Every Time I See One and open Camera mode immediately after to take a snapshot if I manage to snag it.
---
I'm up to 13 now, which puts me in a bit of a conundrum because I'm near my CAMP's max budget and the Thanksgiving Display Case only holds six ... the last one is sitting unprotected in my inventory where I might be tempted to eat it.
---
Sure, I‚Äôve had some fun with it for a while. But the endless flow of bugs and other disappointments killed it for me. Huge waste of time.
---
Oh, I pull that up on my phone:

&gt; 6 months of playing the game constantly
---
Have you heard of this new thing called "Covid" that's been keeping a lot of people at home for the past 6 months?
---
I literally post the exactly same thing last couple of weeks, and all I got was buch of fuckin negative comments, man fuck those people.
---
They need to give us repair kits the queen is a ‚Äúhard‚Äù event and Earle is the only ‚Äúvery hard‚Äù and we get none I‚Äôd gladly forfeit the flux for some sweet repair kits
---
No im good, thanks
---
You can‚Äôt sell a toilet roll for 50K cause the caps limit is 30K
---
I have gotten 38 of them.  All you need is high LCK and 5-6 tries on each one you come across.
---
The "payout" mechanism is pretty neat; on successful tries the gripper hesitates a little bit and moves a tad towards the chute before dropping.  When it misses, it is because it is too far away.
---
This is a great idea, why can't we have some centaurs waggling their tri-tongues at you. Maybe we can see some on the expedition to the capital wasteland, since we all know they are going to reuse those assets from fallout 4 dlc.
---
Yes totally agree
---
What happens when you try and drop? Anything?
---
Weird, I've never had lag on that event, PS4 Pro.
---
Ok then
---
I got mine when I first started playing and immediately ate it, how I regret that now
---
Yep if you don't play right you get 'screwed'
---
Could also add the laser musket but yunno
---
Do you play on Xbox? Last night I went to scrip stuff and I always try to get the pie but it was gone and I was just thinking how lucky someone must be. Going off the time of your post I think it was right around when I was there
---
The lag is caused by Bethesda fucking up patch 21,not players using energy weapons. Lag spikes occur out in the middle of nowhere as well, nowhere near any corpses or Ash piles!
---
False. If you need to cheat and exploit the game you‚Äôre playing the game wrong.
---
Nothing wrong with making a few extra caps;)
---
My friend goes and buys the receipt to craft mutations whenever she‚Äôs at max caps. But she doesn‚Äôt craft or sell any. Because she never has flux. And if she does, she much rather sell her 10-15 weapons she has in her stash box. 
---
When I‚Äôm at max caps I usually look for plans that I might not know. Which is impossible because even when I see people selling 500+ plans, it‚Äôs usually mounted heads or stuff that I already knew. 
---
I try to look for legendary weapons but I never see anything I need. So what I do now, is look for ammo. That‚Äôs it. 
---
I have 3 guns that I use. For I just shop for ammo. 
---
I‚Äôve spent up to 12,000 caps on shotgun shells. I DEFINITELY have enough junk and gunpowder to craft my own. Superduper and ammosmith. But I much rather buy ammo, and know that in 2-3 days I‚Äôll be at max caps again. From selling to the vendor and doing events.
---
That‚Äôs a fantastic idea, give the personal terminal some use am I right
---
Omg the responses annoy me so much ;) Good day to you. How may i help you? Maaaaaaam aaah
---
Yeah, I also wouldn't mind if there was ANY way to spot normal corpses in grass or if they someone shoots them with explosive weapon they wouldn't fly a  mile away. they could explode in million pieces as long as one piece stays at the place where it died xD Also would be nice if corpses in nuked zones (not only) would either stay corpses or turn into meat piles as usual, I often see the items just laying on the ground or in a default paper bag which is very hard to spot in the grass. They have a lot to work on for sure.
---
Q: did you sell your soul to not get fired for allowing this turd of a game to be published?
---
A: abso-fucking-lutly
---
For some reason, Free Range. It‚Äôs easy, but there are some tricks to it. Like, if the Brahmin are hurt, you can run far away from them to heal them back to full health. There‚Äôs always at least one sheepsquatch so I get parts to craft the staff every time, my favorite two handed melee weapon. I also like how many unique plans you can learn from the event. Most people don‚Äôt realize there are 22 plans from that event alone, most being mods for the unique weapons you can learn to craft. I got all of them two weeks after the event launched by running it non stop. Now that it only pops up every now and then, I still run it daily to sell the weapon and mod plans
---
When I go to the whitespring some times I see people fighting against other player in their Camp, the sad part of the PvP
---
True, but I don't want to be one of those people who sell disease cure for 1200 caps or water for 35 lol.
---
Another day older and deeper in debt.
---
Cache at the exit what?
---
Yes, exactly.
---
Why are you dying so much?
---
Sometimes it's what you can make of it. Sorry it didnt deliver for you.
---
Agreed. Good to see some praise.
---
This is 2nd time I hear about this trunk/chest. Someone please tell me where is it and what can be in there? All the times I did this event I escaped every time and now I'm wondering if I just missed it?
---
The camera does an ok job of showing you what you are looking at. 
---
It seems fairly straightfoward to add that ability to gun scopes until they can code in a real solution.  
---
That is, if this is a priority
---
I went on with a level 15 dude, actively fought the entire time, didn‚Äôt die once. These people must go in naked with no stimpacks.
---
So help me if this doesn't change I will go electrocute  an elephant
---
Getting sidetracked is half the fun, I've got well.over 800 hours in on my main character and he is only level 190, but I had a ton of fun along the way goofing around and building different camps. My focus now is finding odd weapon and perk combinations to make fun builds.
---
What I would suggest is to start figuring out your end game build early so you dont have to grind out levels in the end game to get to where you want to be.
---
This website can help a lot with that:
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Imo the first thing I ask myself when making a new build is what I'm willing to sacrifice, will it be damage, health, or special attributes. This will denote the kind of weapon that you will want to get ahold of in the end game. The legendary effects Bloodied and Junkies require you to lose something for more potential damage, bloodied requires you to maintain low health for a very significant damage bonus, while you have to have addictions that take some of your attributes away while you have them for a significant but lesser damage bonus than bloodied. There are however other bonuses lesser than those, which are generally conditional, but can be used without your character becoming inhibited in some way, this set up may not be as effective j  damage dealing, but would have the highest chance of consistent survivability. Just food for thought, YouTube can help a ton to further explain this, you can always ask assistance from the helpful players here, or even message myself an I'd be happy to send you suggestions.
---
As far as leveling fast, there are consumables to help with that such as tasty squirrel stew and canned meat stew, but don't forget to join public teams first and foremost. If you are grinding events join an events team, if you are just doing whatever else, join a building team. Why a building team? It gives +1 intelegence for each player in the party and intelegence increases your experiance gain so you have a constant experiance gain for anything you do that gives experiance.
---
Coming back to builds, bloodied builds also work well with a legendary armor type called unyielding which gives you a +3 to all attributes except endurance while low on health, meaning if you have a full set you can have +15 intelegence, which is nice. The only issues is that low level unyielding armor may be difficult to find, and you would need to build up damage mitagation perks for survivability such as blocker, fireproof, serendipity, ricochet, nerd rage, ect.
---
I hope this helps a bit and didn't make you more confused, wish I could personally give you a hand in game, but I play xb1, so no dice. Have a great time in the wasteland and good luck newcomer.
---
I have one. I've been trying to use it. It's terribly tedious. The effort necessary to use it isn't worth the reward. I'm better off spending 15 minutes grinding for ammo scrap.
---
Would it be a good idea to test the pool by buying 1* legendaries from the purveyor?
---
Yup
---
They should‚Äôve put the new plans in the Chest so it‚Äôs either like screws or toys. Wtf does everyone need screws for anyway I don‚Äôt build much anymore..
---
I've been in west trek a thousand times but didn't even know there was a roof... where is the entrance?
---
I am having the same problem, and so is my wife. We‚Äôre both on PS4 though, and PSN also seems to be having difficulties in general this morning so may just be related to that.
---
Are you a heavy gunner? I use that kind of ammo that is pretty rare to come by, it's rewarded always never and ammo machines (nor workshop nor ArmCo) cannot produce it, so I have to craft and buy it. You might want to get Ammo Smith max rank together with Super Duper max rank so you'd get more ammo of same materials. Have an extra gun for weak enemies that don't require to be put down immediately or a good gun in general. If you're a heavy gunner try to find and lay your hands on Gatling gun, it uses 5mm that are common and easy to craft and it doesn't use a lot of ammo. I make like 5k ammo and then I use it for a week if not longer.
---
I just tried the command terminals right now and the Hide &amp; Seek repeat doesnt start ‚Äî the terminals dont load anything. Do I need to server hop?
---
Yeah, the drops are odd. Once people get the cosmetics they want, there is not much left except the normal, random legendaries. So basically once I get the helmet, I'll save myself repairing weapons and a huge amount of 2mm by just running west tek to get the daily script I need. I already stopped using ultracite ammo on earl since the flux that drops isnt even close to enough to justify it. Now if he returned the ammo you used, or even 70% of it, it would be a different story. But having to grind a ton of ammo, repairing weapons, and not getting much out of the drops, its really not worth it, at least for me.
---
That's helpful, but unfortunately railway spikes weigh a lot and I don't remember if the perk that reduces ammo weight affects them.
---
The event I enjoy the most is the Treasure Hunter one we had a few months back, the one with the Mole Miners. Apparently it's  being brought back sometime. The PTS has it running now I believe. Just to make the whole system of chasing down the Mole  miners a little more exciting I only ever kill them with a knife, so there's an admittedly small chance they could escape. I'm really hoping it becomes an event we get between Themed occurrences such as Faschnat or Meat Week.
---
Bloodied build, so less health.
---
Hell yea got 500 caps from the chest once. And smaller amounts other times.
---
Love the optimism tho! :) 
---
I can bear a certain threshold of bugs and frustrations but it was just too much. Still feels like playing an unfinished game imo. An endless beta.
---
Then do the queen
---
Do the faction quests for both sides until "siding with" quests pop up. You can then pick which one you want to side with.
---
This issue is supposed to have been addressed. It's an old issue that was even happening way before the Wastelander dlc.
---
I can't remember exactly when it has been addressed but i know that it is supposed to be relatively easy to take down now (if you have the dps).
---
At the time it was either going super sonic upon hostility actions or going way to high to be hitable.
---
If that happens again i suggest you to send a ticket. It's the best you can do. This issue isn't supposed to be in the game anymore.
---
Is a ts 40%bashing damage minigun considered a magic gun?
---
This man is a ***professional.***
---
I trade for ammo all the time so I have plenty stockpiled, I just get bored of point and shoot.
---
Router reset didn't work and it's not internet everything else loads fine
---
Lol I've had 7 so far but it did take a year of gameplay for me to start bloody getting any! After that they just seemed to be easier for some reason. There's also one you can pick up on top of Wes tek!
---
I‚Äôve noticed this too! I think the unyielding pool is close to correct too. Anytime I‚Äôve rolled one unyielding, I think I‚Äôve rolled a second on the same server. I‚Äôm going to start making a list of what I roll together.
---
There are 4 possible spawn locations:
---
(1) grove south of SBQ fight - make sure
---
nuke atleast grazes the grove
---
(2) between mining family mansions and the waste disposal dump - nuke area to possibly trigger
---
(3) &amp; (4) craters north of monorail elevator and south of Huntersville. Target nuke to leave huntersville and monorail elevator spawn points just outside nuke area - this gives you easy fast travel to both craters.....also means that you will not nuke my base
---
I stopped rolling for gear as I have too many AP refresh pieces to replace. Why bother?
---
Healing salves, chemist stations, tea recipes, and other items that pile up I just give away. All other plans I sell for 1/10th list price, for money to keep moving around the map.
---
There‚Äôs also a disconnect between myself and the community over ultracite recipes. They rain down constantly, to the point where everyone has a glut of multiple copies for every item. Yet everyone keeps trying to sell them, often for absurd prices.
---
That‚Äôs an end-game disconnect problem where sellers don‚Äôt understand the relationship between people and their product.  You typically can‚Äôt afford to make ultracite ammo until higher level, so there‚Äôs no point in the plans. When you get high enough level to fight the scorch queen, you‚Äôre already getting multiple copies of the plan, so why buy them, let alone pay stupid prices? And yet I see vendor after vendor filled with them. Good luck, seller.
---
did it get fixed? I thought angry turtle tested it recently and it's still in
---
Just go to the folder and delete the images. Unless you're on console which I guess you are so I'll be shutting up. Good chat.
---
Its nice &amp; flat but I moved my camp from there this week as I got fed up having to server hop 5 times every day as my Whitesprings camp could never be placed.
---
*Wouldn‚Äôt it beeee nice*
---
Yea does kinda look like I've got the horn for Meg.
---
You can batch delete from the save file/folder they're saved in. (provided it isn't too hard to find on PC, I can't imagine Xbox is any harder to locate than PS4)
---
I clear the in-game every few days because some pics just aren't for loading (like those daily targets).
---
I'm trying to get better about going into the actual folder every so often to actually delete the ones I don't care about at all, but also pull off to USB the good ones that - now out of the in-game gallery - I do want to save or post somewhere, but don't need to be taking up space.
---
Yes you get it at the whitesprings bunker
---
Massive outages all over the Internet related to L3 communications routing issues
---
Thanks.   There are just enough tadpole badges to get everything.   But those possum badges... It's going to take forever to earn all those.   At least I have the standard size backpack now!
---
I always stay in until it collapses &amp; have never lost junk or loot yet.
---
When you are in the phase of ‚Äúescaping the mine‚Äù you will see the hole to the outside. If you walk backwards about 10m and look to the right you will see a red trunk with some caps and ore
---
Same pc
---
there is often a cargo bot palling around foundation, if you ft there you can probably track one by sound. 
---
the new plans aren't worth much i've seen the meat piles allready at 100 caps and other pretty low, don't forget about rotating the rug, you may be surprised about where it can fit
---
I did some math on ammo converter rates the other day, and while the spikes only require steel, the return per steel is pretty abysmal. You're better off farming Super Mutants for steel/gunpowder and Lucky Hole for lead.
---
that's why i always say apparently when it comes to these "fixes" =0
---
Honestly I‚Äôm the other way around.  I think that I‚Äôd you are in the area (especially during an event) and a legendary dies.  Let everyone get something from it.   
---
It would fix issues like no one wanting to grab ore during Rad Rumble.   Or people ignoring the SBQ (and failing) because they wanted to kill all the small legendaries.  We are al I. This together.    Stop letting people ‚Äòsteal‚Äô someone‚Äôs chance at a legendary (even by accident) by killing something.  When killing that something is exactly what should. E encouraged.
---
Fuck that just pull a borderlands and any missed legendaries make em pop out of a machine
---
Why bother typing all that out? just type out "I don't understand the blm movement at all, I just parrot everything the right tells me to say"
---
I'm in Pacifist mode, surely that avoids PvP right?
---
R Kelly is that you??
---
I stay on the same server for most of the day so I don't really mind having to spend an extra minute or so to get into the server if it means I can have a nicer CAMP spot.
---
Looks kinda like a retro text adventure
---
I have had legendaries disappear after death but never drop the name. I love this forum - I learn something new everyday. Perhaps my dead legendaries didn't disappear but instead dropped the name prefix . Didn't think 'bout that.  On a side note isn't it funny that the word "legendaries " isn't in the software dictionary(as it always tells me I misspelled the word "legionaries". Leave it to Bethesda to mess up the entire English language. What else can we blame them for. LOL. LOL-insert sarcasm icon here.
---
This is why level isn't always an indicator of how effective someone is.
---
And there needs to be a consequence for you using a low health build
---
I'm having thing on PS4. Sucks cause I just got the game yesterday

Idk how he's struggling. I one shot everything that didn't have a huge health bar with my rifleman. Basically only Goliaths, scorchbeast, queen, Colossus, and mirelurk queens were a fight that I'd use more than one round on depending on my rifle.
---
Someone who‚Äôs level 429 thumbs downed me because I turned up at level 58. Little did he know, my build and weapon set were complete. We failed, by a tiny sliver of health (just us two in that instance.) He died about a dozen times, I only died twice and I was clearing spawn. Not long after the event he contested my workshop. He got his ass beat.
---
Its not too bad - my permanent camp is there, and I only occassionally have to server hop to place it.
---
The water spots at the north end will fall under most nukes. Its not nuked regularly any more, but it does still get nuked from time to time.
---
The southern part wont get nuked, but be aware the main water pond is a permanent mirelurk spawn, which respawn every time someone visits your camp. What was going to be an idyllic waterfront property soon became the normandy beach landings  with wave after wave of max level mirelurks attacking, and requiring constant turret repairs even with 9 shotgun turrets.
---
If you're going with the southern part, use the stream as the water source
---
I am for XB1 (UK) also. Servers are doodooüëÄ
---
Go get the Wolf, the mole rat and the feral ghoul samples, and take the fuse out. It will work then.
---
Yes time, I can hit all three pipes from just before the stairs, so it‚Äôs simple, loads me up with meat for the day, knocks out most of the bug spray daily, gives me honey for the sweet water daily, and the special blend you get when done gives +2P which is great.
---
Yup, your more likely to notice the effects of you out the accelerated barrel on it though.
---
Increase your luck skill though using chems and armour and get 4 for your camp, selling for 250caps because they're getting easier to get, hardest part is usually the scorchbeast that attacks me while I try to get my pies
---
Nuka-Covid!
---
I mean technically the Combat Shotgun is based on the PPscH, but youre not wrong
---
You would not believe your eyes
---
why do you not have pacifist enabled if youre anti PVP?
---
I'm on the mirelurk pond. It's kind of popular but I've never actually had any issues. No griefers.
---
Plus the pond spawns legendary mitelurks fairly regularly.
---
Which build? If bloodied/junkie than you're missing the point of my message. non-bloodied/junkie non-auto rifleman vs even just auto rifleman is rock bottom by damage
---
 I think max limit on caps is 30,000 caps.
---
I know I don't have,  are you asking 300 caps?
---
If yes, I'm on PC.
---
Also make it so melee characters aren't fucked over. The new event like the sbq is impossible for melee characters. I'll take the damage from earl but make my 3star melee weapon do more than 1pt of damage why did I build a melee build?
---
Okay thanks , do I need to have Heavy gunner perks etc to make the magic happen?
---
How did they ambush you? How did they do ant damage to you unless you shot back?
---
Also if you lost 50 caps you aren‚Äôt exactly low level
---
Give it the same game mechanics as the punch bowl lol
---
It would only last 15 seconds and then they‚Äôd retell the story of how you killed it in a feature length film with better production value...
---
Ment workshop and i do.
---
I struggle to find the imposter sheepsquatch and even the SBQ so any change would be great
---
That only works for the server silo cool down itself. You also have a personal cool down for each silo to prevent you from launching more than 3 nukes every 2 (or 3?) hours.
---
You have to stay within the event area. You can be outside, just can‚Äôt get too far from the event. This applies to all events.
---
72 isnt 200x4
---
Ah thank you. I normally just launch 3 at most. And then I usually swap servers because I know a lot of nukes can make the server extremely laggy.
---
Yeah, most people don't even launch 3 nukes a day. So they have no idea you have the same timer on your character as the nukes you launch.
---
Only been playing for a few days and got my first taste of this yesterday. Was trying to gather resources for some bullets and also take the ammo factory. Then all of a sudden bamB!!!! Lazer fire everywhere and I am dead and everything in the area that can be destroyed is gone. All those resources wasted.    
---
    During the wekdays it seemed to be fine. But my god, come the weekend and all the nutcase hate mongers with mommy and daddy issues come out of their caves to make other peoples lives hell.    
---
    I just went into a private server after getting the FO1 and just started farming resources. Not even sure what they get out of doing it anyway.
---
One during the final days of the run would be awesome!
---
I think the only plausible explanation for a noticeable pattern in the RNG would be if the RNG is instantiated with a static seed when the server starts.  This would cause the progression of rolls to be the same for each instance.
---
I think the odds of this being the case are extremely low.
---
Yeah same thing on PS4 in Canada
---
Nope perks aren't needed for it, same with if you get a shotgun with a magic effect you'll notice increased damage without the perks.
---
Yeah, but who wants to rock candy canes all year long. 
---
I‚Äôm thinking just Red Green and Blue. Bethesda could even just use the colors form the PA basic color pack they have.
---
I talked to one of the groundskeepers on the Presidium. That aren't any fish in the lakes.
---
Don't get me wrong, buddy is a legend for updating nukacrypt every week.
---
 But I would still nuke just as often if I had to decipher those 3 codes a week.. just makes it take longer on the first three runs is all.
---
Why don‚Äôt you turn on the pacific mode?
---
Damn, all this time I was just passing by trying to escape lol. Thank you!
---
Why don‚Äôt I understand it, because I have a different opinion to you?
---
If your basis of not understanding something is someone having a different opinion than you, you are very narrow minded.
---
I don‚Äôt just listen to one side and repeat what I hear, I look at all things from as many different perspectives as possible, than I make an educated opinion based on that and what I‚Äôve experienced.
---
PC (US) - I've not been able to sign in this morning.
---
On a side note, I'm also having a lot of difficulty/timeouts connecting to various websites (AP, reuters, CNN, imgur, reddit, etc.); not sure if it's related.
---
Troubleshooter armor....solves that problem.
---
Why dont you read an see i ment  workshop
---
Why do you even care about workshops?
---
At the same time please add the personal nuke timer to the middle state holotape so I don't need to remember when I launched from bravo on the last server. Lol
---
Needed fusion cores
---
Thanks for posting this.  I was under attack by a player on the island the other day for not allowing the mirelurks on the island to spawn the queen so I was wondering if I was mistaken.  There have been bugs around this event for so long that I honestly didn't know if something had changed.
---
You‚Äôve never worked with lawyers, have you?
---
Just a pet dish you place and can repair to resurrect them would be enough.  
---
I never go for pets just for this reason.
---
Could I not be a safe distance away from the pond and just use like 10of the small Water Purifiers? If I need Dirty Water I can always just run over to the pond.
---
its all on you then.. youve got nothing t complain about..
---
there is a giant PVP warning when you take a workshop..
---
Do explain
---
got workshop'd it wasnt their base
---
You are warned by the game when you claim or contest a workshop that PvP is possible. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter if it was one player or sixteen that came to the workshop to fight you. You raised the PvP flag and gave an open invitation to the entire server.
---
The only ‚Äòtomfuckery‚Äô here is you griping about being killed in PvP when you volunteered for PvP.
---
Workshops aren‚Äôt Camps. This would be quite a different story if this had happened at your Camp.
---
Cloudfare is down
---
I just ran after when I could, an LVL 71 isn't yet capable of taking down an LVL 110 Colossus and LVL 75 Wendigo's. I only died once tho
---
Lawyers will always put in expansive clauses like those...it‚Äôs part of their DNA.
---
Since Wastelanders I find a lot of handmades on the mid and high level Mothman cultists. These are ones you can scrap.
---
I know grahm has the plan and I'm sure one of the bots in Whitesprings has it too.
---
You didn‚Äôt say ‚Äòworkshop‚Äô until after you‚Äôd made the original post and did so in replies to others. 
---
Don‚Äôt be a jerk when you‚Äôre the one that said ***CAMP*** in your OP.
---
Probably just means that if you *become* one those things you need to just stop playing the PTS or you will technically be breaking the rules. I mean the worst they can do is remove your access.
---
Im not griping im glad they teamed up on a low level for no reason as i made out.
---
That's awesome that you grabbed a screenshot of that!
---
And what qualifies someone as a journalist? Can a blogger be considered a journalist?
---
Easier ways to get them. Craft Gatling Lasers with Super Duper 3. Each on gets you a full Fusion Core.
---
Thats literally what Ive done - I moved slightly more south and now they dont rampage in my camp.
---
If you want the water for aesthetics then its a nice spot. If you're planning to use industrial purifiers then the mirelurks are a pain. They are however an easy source of meat if you use carnivore
---
Were you at your camp or a workshop? Because they cannot so any damage to you at your camp unless you shoot back.
---
There were 2 whole replies for you to read. 20 words lol
---
Man, who crapped in your cornflakes? Losing your junk is annoying, but not nearly as annoying as some random condescending about how you could work around bad game design. 
---
Dumping people out into an active nuke-zone and making them scramble to get their hazmat on was a brainfart moment on the behalf of the designers considering how few builds use power armor.  Hell, Ladydevan got the fast travel bug trying to escape the same situation during a livestream.
---
No no. Fuck that chest. I rather loot the wendigos until I get thrown out from the cave
---
Really good point
---
I spent over 400 modules pre wipe, and I still had to use an exploit to get my last 2 Unyielding pieces.
---
That is the correct interpretation of that clause.
---
You‚Äôre whining and then attacking people in this thread because you said ‚Äòcamp‚Äô but you meant ‚Äòworkshop‚Äô. 
---
The fact that you‚Äôre using vulgar language also shows you‚Äôre irritated and griping. 
---
Learn the game mechanics instead of moaning about them.
---
Alright I'll do the same then, the industrial purifiers are a bit overkill anyway IMO.
---
I dont know about legendary rolls but I 100% believe it about loading screens, I have so many pictures but the game keeps showing me the same 5 over and over again
---
Is your reading comprehension that bad? It was a thank you lol
---
It was at a workshop, OP clarified in a reply. 
---
But don‚Äôt worry, he‚Äôs definitely ‚Äònot griping‚Äô!
---
Did you think the game was lying when it had that big pop up that said ‚Äúare you sure you want to claim this workshop? If you click this you are agreeing to PVP‚Äù
---
lol PvP in 20 tic rate serves ü§¢ü§¢ü§Æü§Æ
---
I did read them. But you‚Äôre the one that made the careless typo and then have an attitude against someone that read your OP.
---
Just read through replies. Jeesh
---
Massive, passive, bloatflies
---
I do both smart guy :P
---
No it wasn‚Äôt. It was a gripe/whine clothed in a flimsy ‚Äòsour grapes‚Äô veil. 
---
You couldn‚Äôt even be bothered to tell your story correctly. 
---
And who are you thanking?  Are they here?  Why are you making this a public thing?
---
Watch someone figure out how to use it for a duplication glitch.
---
Theres a little shack/hut there that you can fit a slocum vendor into that makes it look like a nice market stall
---
Its in the Military wing.
---
Did Bethesda confirm that interpretation?
---
This kid is hilarious. He‚Äôs now claiming it was a ‚Äòthank you‚Äô post to those four players. 
---
I see it now. I always accuse people of ‚Äòtomfuckery‚Äô when I‚Äôm thanking them. 
---
‚Äò*I really appreciate you making these cookies, Grandma!  You‚Äôve got awesome tomfuckery going on in your kitchen!*‚Äô
---
Is it 90rw whilst you have martial artist on?
---
Don't worry, they can sue you based on US law. And if you can't come to the hearing in the US well.. who knows.
---
Do you lose out on even loot if you die when it collapses? Why run out at all?
---
I've been running the Longshoran outfit with it. But a Rocketeer themed outfit would be much better. Bethesda PLEASE
---
*me seeing that and smirks smugly*
---
Maybe now you‚Äôll fix it?
---
On the outside. There‚Äôs a stairwell near the back entrance. Make your way up and get on the roof. Look for a spot with a chair and a table. On the table is the spawn point. If it‚Äôs not there, try agin later or on another server.
---
If they work professionally in journalism then yes, else they are just a blogger.
---
I dunno about you, but if I‚Äôm a little monster and my master just got killed, I‚Äôd try my damnedest to kill the people who did it.
---
They already did...
---
It looks fabulous, ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
It was delayed multiple times and still has bugs? I would have never guessed that...lmao.
---
Not rare, but a good bat if you fancy them.
---
Thanks man
---
I rarely have issues with this, so I‚Äôll count myself lucky. I see one about 1/4 the times I go to Pleasant Valley Station to sell gear. I just tag the cargobot once and it will start circling. Take out the escorts and then find a good slot to attack the cargobot. Focus on its thrusters and it slows down a lot, then it‚Äôs an easy kill. 
---
I think I‚Äôm sitting on about 23 cards right now. I always keep five on me, just in case.
---
And ammo
---
Okay Thank you.
---
A chance at 2 improved repair kits or 2 scrap kits would be cool.
---
It was good for a while but SCORE was too much - under regular circumstances most people would be far more challenged to keep up with the daily grinding.  Longer run I suspect all these low rent updates won‚Äôt sustain interest and more will leave.
---
I can confirm with radiation rumble this does happen for the meat piles, but not anything killed via plasma
---
Yep, the rolls always come in two's.  When I see the purveyor I get 2 of the same effect so damn often.
---
Last night I rolled a furious railway rifle and then a furious fixer.
---
Switched to armor and got a life saving raider arm and then a lifesaving robot leg.
---
There's definitely something to it.
---
Damn that's fascinating. We can only hope the fo76 seeds (as in roll pool, is that the proper term?) are intentionally designed bad as a weird nod to this?
---
What lev did you need if you got the mats I can craft you a set
---
Ahh... that makes sense. Thank you for the easy explanation.
---
I'm so desperate I go to high level's camps and ask them over voicechat if they have any for sale... 'm more than happy to buy, but 2 out of 3 give me one for free.   As a thank you I ask them where do they want the nuke to drop. I noticed there's not much enthusiasm about neither of both big events tho.
---
I started using my Tesla rifle again when everyone started bringing explosive amd weapons and spamming grenades. Same people that raise hell about Tesla rifles are the ones shooting the airborne spawn group with that stuff.
---
Guided Meditation is my favourite to farm tons of XP
---
Four of us were exploring in Cranberry Bog. No mobs near and bam, laaaaag town. We come back to normal speed and whoa legendary sheepsquatch right on top of us.
---
The damn ceilings and fire is what does me in ... don't see it well in VATS
---
Yes but One time I saw a level 50 run trough other Camp while behind him there were charred ghoul and deathclaws, he want to grief with all the enemy
---
It's got 10 slots of its own. Each slot holds a SINGLE item. Not a stack, one piece of food.
---
So you either truly think this. Which is very stupid. Or your just looking to shit post. 
---
Either way. You don‚Äôt belong on the PTS.
---
In pacifist Always
---
At the WV Lumber Co. on the Red collapsed bridge there is a free radical that Is working with some fishing poles
---
Be good if it tracked everything and not just the 3 scout repeatable quests
---
Its been working for me. I notice a drastic difference when I'm not.
---
I lose all those beautiful screws about 75% of the time. Scrap kits don‚Äôt seem to take the screws, either.
---
It doesnt work on gold buillon weapons and armor.
---
A man of culture I see.
---
It has a chance at doubling whatever you make it works with guns as well tho yes just keep spam crafting
---
It would help prevent my briefed ass from hanging out of my Secret Service armor when I swap back and I forget to equip the underarmor. I never notice until my wife says something along the lines of, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs obscene!‚Äù Or ‚Äúoh yeah checking out dat ass.‚Äù
---
From my 20 30 runs so far it's been loot from Earle ( seems lime higher chance for 3 star than queen. But have still got a 1 star) then a garanteed 3 star (probably cuz if you die before you get your loot theres no way back into the mine to get it) then a chance for a 3 star cursed weapon or rare event related plans ( plushie, rug , heads) plus flux and random aid and treasury notes not bullion
---
Yes it works.. As well on bullion stuff
---
You‚Äôre welcome. Was just weighing me down and I‚Äôm scrip‚Äôd out for ~~the day~~ ~~the week~~ who knows.
---
Yes I like that coat
---
Dang!
---
It does not work with bullion items, ulsess they recently changed that.
---
will start start it in 1-2 hours
---
What kinda fun things satan has planned for Christmas I so wonder
---
There‚Äôs an add on in World of Warcraft called GTFO. I need a VATS GTFO.
---
I do not belong there because I asked a question about a contract they want us to sign and agree to? Really.
---
Does robotics expert work on it?
---
It makes the sound and shows the icon but didnt give items before did it change?
---
I'm level 190 and not a cap to my name. Clearly I'm doing something wrong.
---
Honestly it was never that bad yeah it was really bad but it was fun and a good game at its core it‚Äôs kinda funny now it‚Äôs media rating (last time I checked which was like a month after wastelanders) was like 2-3 with very bad ratings but fan reviews were 4-5 stars
---
Being able to skip would be awesome. I turn off the radio now because of a few shitty ‚Äòsongs‚Äô.
---
When I first started playing FO76 I remember thinking, *"...these are the same songs I heard in other FO games..."*
---
But it makes sense kinda; When the bombs fell, all movies, songs, and books that were going to be written had been written.
---
All the same, it would be nice for Bethesda to retcon a new set of tunes into the universe.
---
Well if you think about the wasteland isn‚Äôt dieting it‚Äôs springing with life again
---
You are misleading
---
I‚Äôd like it plz! I‚Äôm able to hop on later today
---
I want that‚Äôs so bad I‚Äôd love to see a super snowy 76 and maybe have blizzards that‚Äôs take down your perception and agility and maybe have like servos locking up in the cold in power armor
---
We have Abraxo! Why can‚Äôt I scour those toilets and bathtubs clean!
---
We also have wrenches! Easy to fix a toilet seat!
---
Can definitely say in retrospect, when I had first fitted my toon with one star armor rolls from the purv, I hit a streak with unyielding and got 3 or 4 within 24 hours, but that the streak followed me from one public server to another, if I remem correctly. The difference between that and SS rolls: I had way more script at less cost to burn thru. The SS has been insultingly poor, but then agn I have been doing 2-3 modules at a time due to the cost and 150 script limit, so... Gonna start saving up those modules beyond 2-3 at a time!
---
What really gets me is you say it took way less attempts in probability on PC over PS4, regarding ~300 on PS4 and ~76 on PC. To narrow that down to ~40 either way would be nice! Gonna look out for these seed pools and follow up, cuz I know if I roll a one star SS I stop on that server, based on experience of continued rolling after getting a one star and ending up with one stars consequetively, and getting a three star off the bat, and then consequtively rolling threes it seems.
---
Maybe consider the star count of the roll as the first priority, and then assign roll pools? Would the star count add another dimension of probability that might render which seed poll cranks out the unyielding differently? Like say you get a one star bolstering or ghoul slay, but then you get a one star unyielding 2 rolls later? Whereas, say you get a two stat bolstering, and then get a two star unyielding on the next roll??
---
Does anyone else think that the Beer Stein display is the "Unofficial" countdown of the games demise? Once all slots have been filled the game will be "finished." 
---
There are six slots: Faschnat stein (1), Legendary Run stein (2), Meat Week stein (3), Armor Ace stein (4) and then whatever the final two would be (season 3 and Brotherhood of Steel?). Once the 6 slots are complete the devs will abandon the game and shut down servers
---
The homing is really intense on gamma guns
---
I bet
---
No you don‚Äôt belong there because you lack enough smarts. There‚Äôs enough people there already not giving feedback. Or giving useless feedback, or just there to data mine, sneak peek or whatever but aren‚Äôt interested in actually helping test the new content.
---
And your clearly one of those. 
---
If you were honestly looking for an answer, you wouldn‚Äôt have worded your post in such a negative and attack manner.
---
So yeah. Stay off the PTS.
---
More so since you were given an answer and refused to accept the obvious reason. 
---
You clearly can‚Äôt be trusted.
---
I knew someone was gonna make this joke at some point
---
Ok deal
---
3 Scout quests?
---
Mine only shows 2 Scout quests and Biv.
---
I just want to use my existing power armor skins to display my armor. I don‚Äôt care for the boxy look of the BOS display
---
Cazadores by the swarm.
---
Best mornin read with my coffee so far this week. I felt as though he was sincerely happy he was pushed to leave that server clearly i was mistaken. i really gotta start seeing past the day to day lies.
---
Works on normal weapons like lever, laser rifle, combat knife, etc. Does not work on items learned from gold bullion.
---
It definitely got me through one self quarantine and general sense of sanity throughout this year. Thanks Fallout.
---
I've been using it since the beginning
---
I was happy everyone else says i wasnt lol
---
It's works for me always get more armor than I craft
---
You can‚Äôt gain the damage boost from being low health and not risk or sacrifice for it
---
Amen brother!!
---
It is time for us to gather at Guided Meditations and manifest our best bloodied unyielding wishes
---
Bloodied heavy gun build or bloodied stealth commando build is the new meta
---
RIP come here emote normally used for this exact thing.
---
That‚Äôs why you can craft multiple...
---
That can‚Äôt be true
---
Lets be fair who really cares how others interpret. If people want to stop by your post and gripe so be it. True to ones self
---
Everyone in each server hears the same song at the same time, so it wouldn't work.
---
To avoid spoiling, i'm just gonna tell you to go at a train station and interact with its news board inside. You'll see a bunch of posters you can interact with. They'll give you a couple of quests that have been added. For the rest, it will be automaticly sent to you through your PipBoy.
---
Lore/story it has to be the Order of Mysteries questline by a long shot. Nothing comes even close.
---
LOL
---
I have had a junkie's and quad gamma gun on me constantly. Gamma guns are perfect for defense because of the manual aim. Right after you've been warned of pvp just aim the head and hold the trigger. Body disappears, you get 60 caps, and you can just hop servers.
---
Or maybe I already did provide feedback without even joining the pts, hmm? Thought about that ? :)
---
And it has never done anything for you. You will hear the sound as it procs but there is no effect. No extra items, no extra anything.
---
Well.. I'll make a video later if I absolutely have to waste modules on gauss pistols just to prove it
---
what effects does these so called magic weapons need to have? besides a high fire rate
---
Got your panties all in a bunch lol. As was clearly stated im happy and said thanks but read into it with your anger as m jumping for joy.
---
Not a fan of emotes. A lot easier to just use a button that pings a spot on the ground for 10  seconds
---
Give the scrapbox to all and let anyone put like 30-50 pound in it per day. limit removed for First member.
---
It's not.
---
Whelp. Funny story. They're readjusting damage which will impact builds coming up, as well as introducing legendary perks. But thats still on the PTS so nothing is concrete.  They're also introducing things called Daily Ops, which are like like little events with minibosses, and unique rewards. Which will also impact builds, and is also still on the PTS. So, quite a bit up in the air. However, you can still do the Wastelander stuff, and grind up some gold, script, and rep. That takes awhile. Have you looked at any of that yet?
---
You don‚Äôt have to, but I‚Äôd really like to see it.
---
I'm sure One Wasteland or whatever will fix this. Some of the less ideal weapons were perfect to explore low-level areas for while scavenging or exploring.
---
I can sneak up on Earle and SBQ. I can tickle deathclaws. But those damned Anglers can spot me from half a mile away and pummel me with fiery target-locked spittle.
---
You know what. You‚Äôre still acting stupid. I guess that‚Äôs never going to change.
---
Collosal problem
---
I met a lvl 987 that had half a year in the game
---
 This video is highly underrated.
---
üëåüèΩ
---
It's worth doing once just for the experience of the chaotic break neck run to get to the chest and avoid/fend off the wendigos as you get the rewards and leave before the cave collapses.
---
After that, it's not worth the hassle.
---
I just advised you that it was already explained but you didn‚Äôt bother reading the two other posts. Dont get all pissy cuz you were quick to point out my mistake lol
---
LOL go away, sunshine pumper.
---
You act like 8 notes is something to be in awe of when most players are running around with hundreds of notes that they will never run out of. 
---
Repair kits are far more valuable and useful.
---
Got a specific question. Looking at this on the right side in the middle - from the bottom going up there is a white wall, a brick half wall, and white (looks like full wall) behind the brick. How did you do that?
---
This. You will hear the sound and see the popup but nothing will happen. There was also a rumor / hearsay that when it procs you get extra \* on your crafted legendary. That is also false.
---
I believe it is scheduled to end on 7th Sep, but I wouldn't be surprised if they delay it ending, plus we expected to get some double score time in the near future I believe. I was behind and didn't think I would make it, but I am now ahead because of the double score and I only do my dailies, I was pleasantly surprised, so continue doing your dailies and weeklies and go as far as you can and you can decide if you want to pay for some levels using your atoms you get with the season.
---
Not on plans you bought with gold bullion.
---
Or you could point out that‚Äôs how Star Trek was saved - a canceled show got a film which ended up having enough popularity to save the franchise. Some franchises just don‚Äôt have as big of a fanbase as they want to keep it going
---
Wait, what subreddit am I on now?
---
They should at least be friendly if you are wearing the cultists outfit and mask.
---
Check the vendor bots at train stations. I see them for sale there a lot.
---
Saying something loudly doesn‚Äôt make it true. 
---
You weren‚Äôt happy at the moment you got attacked. That‚Äôs extremely unlikely. 
---
You might be acknowledging the silver lining. But that‚Äôs far different from ‚Äòthanking them‚Äô. 
---
But maybe you always accuse people of tomfuckery when you‚Äôre thanking them?
---
Sickleman IS here
---
And then proceeded to point it out a 3rd time lol need a nap?
---
Emotions running wild. What I wanted to allude to that they did a call to arms for more testers. But having that in is doing the opposite. Why enter the beta if your rights are limited and you do their work for free?
---
That‚Äôs called ‚Äòsour grapes‚Äô. 
---
Just because you proclaim something loudly doesn‚Äôt make it true.
---
I wouldn't say super rare but also not super common either.
---
I think it might just be a you thing. I don't think the devs go out of their way to make hunting rifles rarer than other weapons.
---
Everything you make a disingenuous comment, I‚Äôll point it out.
---
You don't have to as there is already videos about it. Here is one. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwdm3vG1YO4&amp;t=86s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwdm3vG1YO4&amp;t=86s)
---
I‚Äôm fine dealing with your stupidity.
---
You know it's bad when we turn to fictional post apocalyptic wastelands as a happy escape from the real world...
---
I would be happy with my ammo ingredients honestly. Steel, lead and acid would be great. I can craft it for all I care. Still faster then running lucky hole or Line in the Sand for steel. With ammo factory legendary perks that would be awesome.
---
Which is why brake checks are important...
---
I saw a (insert small child/dog/debris) in the road officer.
---
This is exactly why this new event will only be popular for a little while and then fade gradually like Project Paradise and Encrytpid. Once everyone has the new stuff from it, its a lot less appealing to run vs the SBQ that gives notes, kits, and legendaries all while being faster and easier to complete. Using less ammo.
---
He cares quite a bit. 
---
To paraphrase the Bard; *‚ÄôThe OP doth protest too much, methinks.‚Äô*
---
Will try that.  Thanks.
---
I mean yeah ,but that is bc I played like 6 hours leveling up
---
Due to Covid, I have never been busier. No, sweet unemployment with that $600 bonus. I'm essential and it sucks. On the flip side, I bought a house in Florida with a pool with interest under 3% and I am having a baby with the wife. Made a fortune off of the stocks when it crashed too. all I want is to be left alone and play video games but I have to be an adult and do adult things...I just want to play video games.
---
same rarity as other legendary weapons. 
---
you're better off with a lever or fixer anyway. or handmade. or combat rifle tbh
---
yeah the hunting rifle hits hard but it has a slow fire rate and slow reload. an instigating lever or AA or something absolutely wrecks stuff.
---
No, fuck the chest! It‚Äôs already damn difficult to get to, I have to drink Nuka Cola Quantums to have enough AP to sprint all the way to get there only to find nothing good in the first place! Then I don‚Äôt even reach it half the time because I‚Äôm killed before I can get there.
---
Pvp has a damage cap so once you hit it it wouldn't matter
---
300h since beta
---
Very good to know, I‚Äôve only done the event once and wouldn‚Äôt have gone down at all if it weren‚Äôt for getting fear-ran into one of those things. I was too mad in the moment to think of such a simple solution lol.
---
Thanks.
---
No i just learned that theres actual NPCs now, last i played i finished a the "factions" that just end with more holotapes
---
This I didn't know. Thanks for the explanation!
---
Thanks for the answer and all of the detail.
---
Or a beacon of light like The Division.
---
Reviving this post! I've just switched my character to a bloodied build at lvl125 and this bug is so irritating! Why haven't they fixed it yet? I love the build but am so frustrated after spending all those perk points that it's just broken fast travelling...
---
Encryptid is not meant to be training camp. 
---
It may be one of the few events in which I can get killed, so, please, let the Imposter continue being a pain the butt.
---
But then even less people would buy them from the atom shop...
---
I fucking hate that. I get so frantic trying to at least mark the fucker.
---
I need help launching nukes @ Mr Joker21
---
 xbox
---
I'd go lever action, avoid the gauss unless they fix it. But yeah, I rarely see bolt actions.
---
I know. I don‚Äôt eat them lol. I‚Äôm just saying I got one early on
---
3 legendaries in 6 hours is so bad lmao
---
thanks, but I'm on PS4
---
AMEN! üëè
---
‚Äù...replacing the disk space with cat content and memes.  Your move.‚Äù
---
Ha!  Hahhahaha! Snort.  That made my day.
---
But seriously, Bethesda, at least fix the bugs that occur in battle -  rubberbanding, VATS95% repeated misses, frame-rate, etc.  You would think you'd be embarrassed about it.  Smooth combat seems like such no brainier basic.
---
I think when everyone got the plans their enthusiasm  to do it a lot stopped, they will still all turn up like moochers after a free meal to either but they won't go out of their way to launch themselves
---

---
This part?
---
In the Gamescon interview, the developers indicated September as the release date for Legendary perks, so I have my fingers crossed.
---
They're that hard to get? I got two before I even reached level twenty. I ate one hoping for an achievement but got nothing. I saved the other in my stash box. I haven't clicked on those since level 25ish.
---
Yes. Nukesdragons. No. No. Idk
---
The game says your still in sneak and doing bonus damage but as long as someone is fighting the collosus out of stealth, your stealth benefits no longer exists despite what the game is saying.
---
Refund if you still can
---
Yes! That part and the wall that's to the left of it (also in your circle)
---
I agree and I also think it should give more stable flux.
---
Uh, Those are hard to get? Maybe, I should stop eating them.
---
I have an underground camp at the lead+acid extractor location. The entrance is well hidden, and the underground portion allows me direct access to the cave with the acid extractor. It‚Äôs also protected by the occasional scorchbeast spawn, save the small portion of my camp that‚Äôs above ground.
---
You do t need fo 1st, I have it and literally on use private server to transfer gear from one toon to the other. They have done an amazing job fixing this game since launch . Yes there are still bugs but it's mostly just annoying not game breaking. And your not stuck with your choices ( when it come to special points) after lev 50 you can move and change points around.
---
They fixed a lot of things and in the process broke some things. 
---
Think about what weapon/s you want to use and look for some builds. Once you hit 50 though you can move a point or pick a perk every level up. So it's all good. To get the optimum build might take you to 65-70 depending on what you want and what cards you have. 
---
You should get to 50 before getting fo1st. Maybe even 60 or so. By then you should know if you love it or hate it. And you could always take fo1st for a month. The tent is great but the scrapbox is the best part of it. Some people take fo1st for a month or two and fill the scrapbox as much as possible and the cancel. And then after a few months they take it again and fill it some more. Which what i am doing. Spent 3 months filling it and i have enough scrap to last me about a year.
---
Translating this for PC: You move the mouse left and right.
---
It'd be better if it was A and D that steered you, but it's not.
---
Advice from me 2 you. Clear the wastelanders questline and vanilla main quest. Focus on exploring the map and doing quest. Once u done all that, and got a general feeling of what this game has to offer, you should be atleast 70ish. At that point u might start considering spending money, and making builds.
---
I'm on ps4. I could join you and help along the way
---
I found a grenade in the machine inventory once but I suspect another player may have dropped it in there for funzies.
---
Nuclear Winter bug fixes, balancing and stability.
---
Up to level 50 you get a skill point AND a perk card (which you can swap around whenever you feel like), after 50 you can choose to either swap a special point OR pick a new perk card.
---
‚ÄúThe servers look empty‚Äù. 
---
Thousands of people are playing right now and are filled dynamically. Whether 100 people are playing or 100k you will always only see 20-24 per server. This comment makes zero sense.
---
If ten million kangaroos
---
No. That means some players are getting more than other players and that not fair. 
---
If just playing the game for fun isn‚Äôt enough, take a break.
---
I respawned there once too, super annoying. At least if you spawn outside the mine you can get event rewards but still...
---
I want the Wanamingos first. Centaurs can come after that.
---
You don‚Äôt need fallout 1st. 
---
You aren‚Äôt locked into special. After level 50 you can start moving points around. You keep collecting cards every level up also so you can swap in and out whenever you want.
---
Wow, that's genuinely terrible.
---
If I were designing this, I'd have it affect the whole AID section of the stash as well as automatically go to that section when you click on it. I suppose their whole "no pay to win, wink wink" deal is what made it that way.
---
In Fallout 3  when you level up you choose a Perk, and put points into Skills. One perk, lets you increase 1 Special attribute, and another if taken at Level 30 lets you increase all Special to 9. 
---
In Fallout 4, when you level up you get to choose 1 perk, or increase one special attribute, you can eventually max out each attribute then pick up bobbleheads to have 11 on each special stat. 
---
In Fallout 76, when you level up, you are given the choice to choose 1 Special Attribute to increase, then you have to choose a Perk Card, or to Level up a Perk Card. Unlike 3&amp;4, your Special Stats can go up to 15, but you can only increase them up to Level 50. Also do not increase a Stat to 15 prior to hitting 50 or you will get locked out of choosing perk cards for that stat. 
---
I suggest using the Wiki to figure out what perks you want, then build your Special accordingly. [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_perks](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_perks) 
---
Please note that while in previous games 1 Strength Stat meant +10 Carryweight, in Fallout 76 it is halved, so you only get +5 Carryweight.
---
No but if you hook up an SDD and put on FO76 on it, you'll get a 20 second advantage.
---
Back before Wastelanders dropped, everyone loaded in at about the same time regardless of whether they had an SSD or not. The loading screen would say "waiting for all players" at the bottom right and the game wouldn't start until everyone was ready.
---
Big Facts. I play alot of other stuff but this is the only game I can literally get lost in for hours.
---
Well, I finally lunched one, solo, no wall glitch. Got the queen down to 25% health, and then in true fashion, the game crashed to the homescreen. Couldn‚Äôt have been more encapsulating of my overall experience with this game since launch. Interestingly, I haven‚Äôt had a queen-fight crash in MANY months. Ah well.
---
Only reason most people pay for it, which is why they'll probably never do it unfortunately
---
Not the best at explaining lol so hopefully these pics answer your question. I removed a roof where the two lights are so you could see the full wall
---
[https://imgur.com/a/NcRgjCq](https://imgur.com/a/NcRgjCq)
---
First play through I was like take it down a   notch. If you hand her the holotape after her demeanor changes to nice again.
---
Talking base weapons. Lever, hunting, gauss. Rifles are not rock bottom in damage it's bottom in DPS. Auto rifles are the best DPS in the game so yeah not really what I'd compare it too.
---
If I needed atom for something good on the shop, its still technically the best atom pack, and the bonuses afterwards are still plenty incentive
---
Not that I think they should change it, but there wouldn‚Äôt be anything unfair about it. People who had put more time and effort into an early completion of the run can be rewarded. You are not being penalized just because you can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt put more time into a game
---
They could make a device like a heartbeat sensor from Modern warfare but for loot
---
All I want is a way to have it permanently
---
Right correction, DPS was what I meant in my comments.
---
The season pass it self is rewarding the most loyal players dude...
---
Make it a live stream. More fun for us.
---
It sure af didn't work for my plasma caster.
---
That's is perfect! It's a mix of half was and full walls at certain point. Thanks for thanking the time!
---
Each Perk Card has a Number in the Corner, this is how many Points it takes to equip into a Special Stat. So to put a Perk Card with 2 into say Luck, your Luck would have to be 2. This fills that Special Stat, you would need higher Luck to allocate more cards.
---
Everyone is supposed to have the same time to earn the same rewards. If you finish early, and then still get rewards from it, your getting more than others.
---
This idea which isn‚Äôt even original, will simply create a frenzy of people trying to finish the run as fast as possible so they can get extra atoms.
---
Your just being greedy.
---
No worries, lemme know if you have any more queries
---
Or a holotape, like the missile state holotape.
---
To tell you the truth, I'm note sure where wastelanders ties into the original content since I started playing after it dropped. I'd head to Sutton and find the Overseer, that might be the place to start. How much detail do you want on things?  Build wise, two shot isnt considered that good anymore, but that may change coming up. Not that it will be better, but everything else will be brought down.
---
No it‚Äôs not. You don‚Äôt have to play every day to complete it. So no not only the most loyal. 
---
This idea will what rewards those loyal players. 
---
Man you all are such greedy people.
---
If the legendary run is your only reason to log in, you're done with this game, my friend. Perhaps it's time to move on.
---
this hurts my eyes but thank you!
---
I always do the Foundation one, since it is near my camp, so I wind up with a bunch of pics of Paige in my load screen. Nice dude and all, but there are better things to look at.
---
No. I‚Äôd rather they make something better.
---
He gon' 'restl 'dat sonofabih' wendig-o
---
my 2020 since january:
---
out of 8 years of rehab because fighting depression;
---
learned a new job in this time and now searching for work: no one recruits cause corona.
---
not possible to run our D&amp;D group cause of effin corona. 
---
gaming is the best i can do atm with my time. but it starts to suck too. though i like fall and winter, i fear for the worst now that the dark season of the year is rollin in...
---
Free Atoms era is ovah and dunzo yo.. 
---
aint gonna happen.. get used to it
---
no
---
This. 
---
Instigating Lever plus sneak and headshot bonus pretty much one shots everything. Add Bloody Mess and Adrenaline for even more damage.
---
&gt;I dont want to set the world on fire...
---
dont worry, its burning already....
---
Loot everything and sell whatever you don‚Äôt need to bots.
---
  If you can make mutation serums, those are worth about 500 caps at any bot vendor.
---
Doesn‚Äôt take long to hit the 1400 daily cap limit
---
  Sell duplicate plans, excess ammo, and more desirable junk (acid, for example) at your camp.   With the buy/sell 3 items from a player daily, you‚Äôll make some caps that way, too.
---
If you don't like it, you can play another game. This is exactly how they performed for over a year. The only reason anybody used them early on was because TSE shotguns gained a 900% damage bonus
---
Yeah, even if we had to collect sealed jars to put food in at the cooking benches, that would be really great.
---
Yes, that would be nice too. Both of these combined would help.
---
Well the server feels empty because you feel empty, if I can say lol. I see a bunch teams everytime i join a world, i always feel the world alive if i can say ( i still haven't completed the season pass, returning player here.). But you are absolutly right, it has to mean something to finish the season pass ! Giving some extra atoms could definitly make the job and keep us grinding these activities with the other players working on their season pass.
---
Everytime
---
The silo cooldown I understand, but the personal nuke cooldown needs to go. "Stop it, you're having too much fun!" Agreed 100%.
---
Also, if it takes you between 30 minutes and an hour to do a silo, don't worry, it gets easier as you level up and get better gear.
---
Ty for that
---
Its called yahoo i got a bunch of gear lol
---
Just saw that
---
Well, if you meet her dad, you understand where she gets it from.
---
YOU WILLL CALL HERRRR!
---
Your really a pleasant person arent you lmfao
---
&gt;Everyone is supposed to have the same time to earn the same rewards. If you finish early, and then still get rewards from it, your getting more than others.
---
The developers should reward the effort of players, not penalize them for enjoying the game enough to finish early (especially with double point and challenge weekends)
---
they should not be penalized just because of the apathetic and lazy don‚Äôt care to finish. The season pass rewards are not an entitlement, if you can‚Äôt finish because of work or just not wanting to, other players should not be penalized 
---
&gt;This idea which isn‚Äôt even original, will simply create a frenzy of people trying to finish the run as fast as possible so they can get extra atoms.
---
That would actually be in the developers best interest, as it would keep more players engaged during the run, even if they were finished
---
&gt;Your just being greedy.
---
You‚Äôre just being selfish that you don‚Äôt want anyone else to get a benefit because you can‚Äôt be assed to put more effort in
---
No no bro, the more you play the more you unlock...the game rewards the most loyal players. This is the point of a season pass. It's to keep the players coming back.
---
Now if ppl are playing more than you to this game, they shouldn't be penalised because the casual players wanna go play something else or have kids or homework to take care of.
---
Come on man, what's your problem !?
---
The SPECIAL system works like this. Every stat starts at 1 and can go all the way up to 15. You get one point to assign every level from 2 until 50. Every level up also gives you one perk card, and you can get a random pack of perk cards every five levels.
---
After level 50, you get a choice every level up. You can either take one of your SPECIAL points and move it between two stats, or you can gain a new perk card of your choice.
---
Perks cards have different point values based on how effective they are and you can equip a total points value of cards equal to the SPECIAL stat they match. So, if you have 3 Perception then you can only equip 3 points worth or Perception perks. 15 Luck and you can put a whole 15 points worth of Luck perks on your character.
---
They're introducing a system of Legendary perks soon that give you six slots at intervals starting from level 50 up to 300. These are much more powerful perks, and are bought with coins that you get for trading in duplicates or your regular perk cards.
---
At any point in the game you can change around the park cards you have equipped for any of the other cards that you've got available. So if you find yourself in a situation where your shotgun has broken, you might find a quiet space to swap your perks over to favour a melee weapon or pistol, for example. 
---
The game is pretty much an introduction until level 35-ish in its current state, as that's when it really starts opening up. By then you should have enough of your character idea in mind to have been building it a bit already. And at level 50 you can start tinkering with anything you're not happy with in order to make the character fit that vision better. So there's no wrong way to level up here.
---
Been playing since Jan 2019; never heard of that one.
---
VE is a nice combo though :)
---
NO! It‚Äôs still bugged in fo4
---
Whatever you find you need more often. Lead is always solid. Copper maybe.
---
There is 2 cool down timers. 
---
1 for you and 1 for the silo. 
---
You can launch 3 from all 3 silos at any times. 
---
But once you‚Äôve done all 3 you have a cool down timer in place. 3 hours I believe  
---
If you was unable to enter the silo then maybe the silo was on a cool down. You can always check that by clicking on the Missile Holo Tape (if you‚Äôve done the quest line) which will tell you if the silos on the server are on cool down.
---
You can purchase them from one of the vendors at white spring resort and I believe their is hats to go with it
---
While I agree something should take the place of SCORE once the legendary run is finished - i get why it's not atom. We do need something in it's place though - maybe caps/vault tec supply boxes/lunch boxes/repair kits? Something to reward players without incentivising rushing through the legendary run as fast as possible.
---
Getting more for doing more is actually pretty fair.
---
Most of the time they don‚Äôt have the patience to deal with my complicated explanation of why I can one tap everything and everyone, and I don‚Äôt usually have the patience for them trying to kill me and denting my health bar. Then proceeding to shred theirs in a tenth of a second.
---
I'll have to keep my eyes open.
---
I know I currently have a 3* Vampires something or other in my vendor box... Maybe I'll switch it up. I imagine most of my perks should cross-apply.
---
Does that surprise you? üòÇ
---
Yep me too for the same price in cex at the beginning of lockdown . Ended up getting 1st as well as I am obsessed with amassing junk!
---
Agreed. But good concept.
---
Lmao was this not fixed yet? It's been an issue since launch
---
I'm just wondering on what sort of things i missed out on, i just used two shot meta as a time frame. How much content did i miss? Did i miss out on a lot?
---
What‚Äôs your problem? Why are you so greedy? You get 104 rewards for the Run. You want more stuff after finishing and getting that.
---
You don‚Äôt need to be this loyal player coming back every day to play for about an hour or less. There‚Äôs more than enough proof that you don‚Äôt have to be this loyal player your describe to get all the rewards.
---
Your not fooling me. It‚Äôs greed and you want more.
---
Your not doing more.
---
Not one bit sadly, the elevators were cool though
---
Commando. SMGs are rifles, while auto pistols are pistols modded to auto.
---
Three hours is really too long, people are forced to server hop once all three were done.
---
Ok, thanks
---
I like a combo of Instigating .50 Hunting/Sniper rifle and a Furious Lever for when things get hairy
---
Should be commando I believe the Tommy gun should be considered a rifle
---
Shoot them down every time you run across one, irrespective of if you plan on launching that particular play session.
---
you‚Äôll have plenty :)
---
76 has a lot more building restrictions than 4 did. 
---
VATS works a bit differently, instead of freezing time you are basically getting a heavy aim assist that eats up your AP. 
---
A lot of things were fixed since the initial launch, and they've re-added Human NPCs, though this has made some areas harder to explore as now there are Blood Eagle Raiders where there used to be nothing. 
---
If you want some additional help, send me a friend request on PS4, PSN Vortall
---
&gt; You‚Äôre just being selfish that you don‚Äôt want anyone else to get a benefit because you can‚Äôt be assed to put more effort in
---
Calling out your greed doesn't make it me selfish. It's your greed that is selfish. You literally want more than you deserve. You're the ass. 
---
If the only thing that makes you play a game, is the amount of stuff you can add to your hoard, then yeah, you're greedy. And yeah your selfish.
---
The fear attack is bugged or something. I ran straight to big ol‚Äô screaming Earle several times lol
---
I'm actually not sure, sorry. I would assume it does but it might depend on the enemies energy resistance.
---
This is how it was working before the season pass...we...were...getting...atoms bro. It was giving us the oppotunity to get about 500 atoms per week.
---
With weapon WR armor + a 90% reduced weight weapon...yea, its possible the weight is close to zero.
---
Yeah if silos are on cool down then lots of hoping. (Which I do a lot as we run a nuke group)
---
Pipe is life...
---
I literally said in my original response to you that i didn‚Äôt think they should change it, i was literally explaining how if they changed it, it wouldn‚Äôt be unfair.
---
Your only argument on why it would be unfair is ‚Äúsome people will have more than others based on the amount of effort they put in‚Äù
---
If that is not your argument, an argument based on laziness and entitlement, then please clarify
---
And when they introduced the Legendary run, they TOLD YOU THE OLD WAY  is gone. And you just can't handle it. 
---
Things change, the game evolves.
---
It's not a story Bethesda would tell you.
---
Massive outage for CenturyLink
---
Could be the level 2k guy that i saw on ps4 3 weeks ago.
---
I got 3* bloodied hr from colossal problem yesterday. Don‚Äôt remember other stars, but I‚Äôd take caps or ammo for it if you‚Äôre interested.
---
Yea many times right after the third SBQ 1/3 of the server left. No effing reason to justify this ‚Äòcool down‚Äô bs. It‚Äôs just software reset so three hours is totally unnecessary, it‚Äôs not like a bunch of gutsys have to go into the silos and mop the floors or something.
---
Oh now I have to evolve !? No more greedy !? lol
---
Don't forget that windego teeth scrap to 2 acid i can usually walk out of there with 80 to 100 acid per run.
---
Imo acid is a great one for ammo production
---
Lead ore from lucky hole produces a ton of lead, needs acid to smelt
---
Gunpowder needs acid and cloth to craft
---
Steel is super easy to farm
---
Since collection came out I would say junk nodes are slightly less of a big deal
---
Edit: iirc copper extractors give ore instead of raw copper
---
2k? This man needs a gf
---
There are alredy the floater that are a nightmare
---
Are you on PC? Let me know what the other two stars are, I might be interested!
---
duly noted..
---
As someone who lives in Ohio, I can't belive they actually made the Ohio River way cleaner than it is in real life in a Fallout game
---
They are  good games but onestly I don't like Fallout 45
---
I guess you can‚Äôt hold two thoughts about yourself at one time. I can‚Äôt do anything about you‚Äôre stupidity though.
---
Now please give me done half baked insult about me being stupid.
---
Only one of those 84 is valid.
---
Sell 83 to a bot vendor.
---
Well no atoms no daily incentive, and if you have other games, why not.
---
That's a great idea! Thanks!
---
Crap, stupid of me not to ask for the platform. I‚Äôm on PS4 unfortunately.
---
This quest was one of the best I ever played and it was heartbreaking.
---
I just wore it with the pristine miner outfit since it fits the theme.
---
If you play enough.  If you only have time to play a little bit each day, you might not.
---
Also Clean Mining Uniform allready exists in the game
---
Ah well, no worries. I appreciate the offer anyway :)
---
Personally Fallout 3.14 was my favorite

We need to have the ability to restart quests or something... An option to cancel a quest and start over from the beginning. Anything I can do in this scenario? Make a ticket and request they reset the quest progress or something? I haven‚Äôt turned it into Meg yet so is there still a chance they can do that?
---
Ok. Thanks.
---
You're misinterpreting future here. What that means is that you will not now (at this time you are signing this agreement) or in future (during the length of this agreement) do anything that will affect what you're doing during this agreement. Now, technically, that could include discovering time travel and then coming back to talk shit about the game under your current identity, but that's very unlikely as you never get your time travel license.
---
Am I not Mothy enough for the Mothman cult?
---
Nice, a Primus fan.
---
46 was rubbish
---
That's a lot of words for "I want to ride the brahmin into battle".
---
Well if we gotta be called greedy because we refuse to evolve everytime someone is taking something away from us...don't you think something is wrong with that logic Think about it champ ! I'm not voting for you if you are running for the president my man...we gonna work for free.
---
Hope you find one soon! I was using hr + pistol sneak build for a while - it‚Äôs really fun to do regular play through this way, as it doesn‚Äôt just wreck everything like bloodied commando, so you have to be more strategic about things, which helps with immersion.
---
The story is essentially non existent and has nothing to do with any of the other games.
---
Sounds like a dev room item.
---
I gave up on this game and went back to a modded FO4 the other day. Just done.
---
Hunting-,Lever- and Gauss Rifles all benefit from the Rifleman Perks. Semi auto Fixers and Handmades too btw.
---
Use fireproof under endurance or a dense torso mod. Don‚Äôt need both. With either one you can take the explosive damage no problem. Hell you can sit on exploding cars with barely a scratch.
---
If you want lead, go acid instead and start going to lucky hole mine with excavator power armor on.  Mine all the lead ore and use acid to make lead out of it.  You get around 400 lead per trip.
---
Your only getting sued if you maliciously divulge proprietary information that they are sharing with you and harming them and all of us who enjoy the game in the process. Which is a standard business practice, not far from copyright principles. You did not buy access to the pts with your game purchase. You have 0 right to be there. The PTS benefits everyone, its a volunteer thing(if you wanna get paid for it, expect other players to pay you, with higher fees for 1st and atom shop you dumb dumb), stop being stupid.  
---
You are screaming fire fire fire, while standing at the stove... Noone has any idea what your issue is. You just do you tho i guess, have a good day.
---
The amount of times I have given up trying to loot a 3 star legendery item becous I just give up looking.
---
I use max fireproof.  I don't have the exact weapon you mentioned, but I have a BE R15 gatling plasma that kills me really easily that I essentially can't use, even with fireproof.
---
Here is why all those that think this is a great idea are greedy.
---
Atoms are only good to buy stuff from the Atomic Shop. The Atomic shop is 96% cosmetic. Outside of scrap and repair kits, none give you any advantage in the game. 
---
Which means, you want the fun stuff for free. That's greedy. So yeah, it's greedy and unfair.
---
If only there so some sort of indication that your weapon durability was running low. Even better if you could repair your weapon when it‚Äôs at, say, half durability. Someday...
---
but 50 had that thing you know.....
---
It has a stock, it's a rifle.
---
I've got two keycards from cargobots that Watoga's bots went off on, and I've been carrying them for a while before even finding that mission. Did I steal them from someone or are they ambient?
---
You didn‚Äôt miss much except maybe Fallout 69
---
I know in my heart that they appreciated it.
---
Super Fallout 64 was a surprising departure from form, but it was a decent platformer.
---
She‚Äôs stalking you son, best head up to the penitentiary and speak to the warden, see if he can get some deputies after her.
---
I was in a Silo last night, just finished, just dropped my heavy armor and missles you get as a reward for that. Then, someone somewhere clearned the Cop a Squatter quest, and I got another set of heavy armor in my inventory to go drop. Frustrating.
---
We need to [get *inside* the animals.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikdSNY_K6vY)
---
which vendor?
---
The best solution to not getting feared is to ask, crouched with a stealth suit on up high in the corner where no one can hurt you.  /s
---
Same, I died at just the wrong time, didn't get event completion, and was spawned outside the nuke zone.
---
Ah, Sandman. One of the least pleasant people I‚Äôve had the misfortune of encountering on PS4.
---
Although I do think something is needed, I feel like atoms would probably increase the amount of people glitching their way through to complete it as fast as possible
---
That too.
---
You don't *have* to use vats
---
I never realised how much I wanted jetboots until right now.
---
Do we not already have point with gun and a fingerguns emote? How could a sensible feature that should have been there since day one possibly beat that?
---
I‚Äôm the one that gave you advice on an easier way to get Fusion Cores. So, yeah, I am nice. 
---
I also call out baloney when I see it. 
---
It‚Äôs quite easy to do both.
---
Probably because rifles need the nerf in that regard. 
---
Since you can attach silencers to almost every rifle (Handmade and Fixer are the top dogs there), you can deal OBSCENE amounts of damage with a stealth Commando.
---
While heavies have respectable dps, none of them are silenced. It is basically impossible to make a stealth Heavy.
---
So, in order to balance out the x2.5 damage per shot, rifles come without weight reduction perks. Otherwise, there would literally be no reason not to use them in favor of every other weapon in the game - you would deal the damage of every heavy weapon, while being undetectable AND your weapons would be near weightless.
---
And that's not even getting into VATS. Heavies are horrible in VATS, but a Commando can use that stuff for days...
---
I have an instigating hunting rifle?  It's not all that great though. Limb damage and something else I don't remember are the other effects.
---
Same here.  Usually have around 20 at any given time from just running into the things while doing something else.  I'll do the terminal if I just happen to be in the bunker to burn caps, but I don't think I've used it more than 5 times over the course of a year.  Nice to have a stash of them though.  I can just decide to launch 3 or more in a play session without having to track any down.
---
Hey it ain‚Äôt about kids, just golden showers
---
From reading the replies it sounds like this issue would be solved I the elevator hand scanner would be red if our personal timers have not expired yet.
---
Looks like it's in the game but unobtainable
---
Personally hate the time out nonsense. If you are a balls to the wall crazy player you get penalised for going full on hard. Some people like to be a tank and smash things. Some like to play smart. This event says very hard and over a certain level. I am above 140 and still get mashed into paste as I am a crazy go hard player (i was in lvl 60 areas at lvl 15. It is just how I play)
---
You're.
---
I once had Beckett fast travel with me from my camp to Vault 76. I also had the government supply drop fast travel with me from Morgantown airport to my camp lol
---
It's apparently an unreleased atom shop skin.
---
Hey don't mean to mislead. Platform didn't matter I did my learning and majority of testing on PS4. I play less on PC that is the only difference. Otherwise platform to me doesn't seem to matter. Stars don't seem to have a pattern I've identified at least. I only tracked the prefix. The counts were various 1 to 3 star rolls I didn't record that detailed
---
Mechanist outfit? Kind of exotic, but if you have it...
---
I prefer the Lever Action over the Hunting Rifle. You only get 4 shots with a hunting rifle vs. the 5 you get with the LAR. Plus, it seems like it's faster on the reload.
---
I don't know. They seem more separate and I only tested the consistency of crafting SS pieces. If you decide to test please record the findings!
---
&gt;!\&gt;! Spoilers ;) !\&lt; !&lt;
---
Daddy would you like some sausage?
---
Bro. Were you on PC? I believe that was me.
---
Whenever you hop on put your gamertag in these comments and I'll add you and join you and give you the armor
---
Anyone have a picture? I haven't seen it yet.
---
Not sinking into the ground would definitely be the first step. I lost three 3-star legendaries to that just yesterday.
---
When hunting keycards, join a public team, shoot down the cargobot, and get as many people around the cargo bot drop crate, then lock pick it. That way everyone who is present during the lock pick of the drop crate gets to loot the crate and get a free keycard.
---
PRO TIP: If you're running Unyielding armor. With high level luck. You'll get the pie within 3 tries.
---
I've got atleast 20 of them.
---
The pts server daily ops will drop anywhere around 30 ammo for the weapon you used to kill the enemy with so lets just hope that it'll stay.
---
There are mods for HR to give you five and six shots per magazine. But yes, it's slow.
---
He really didn't to be honest.  He shot a *wolf* with a shotgun and claimed it was still working.  I personally killed the sbq with a "magic" minigun and couldn't get it to work.  I've literally never had magic not work before and I know how to do it.
---
That makes sense, how does one cancel the agreement? Uninstalling the pts, or contacting support?
---
What about bodies going under the map after being shot. I notice if their heads hit the ground first then for sure they will go under the map.
---
No issue in UK
---
Well they retconned everything in 75 when the vault dweller punched a hole through reality so everything that happened in the previous 74 never actually happened.
---
I thought it was ward to until I read the title
---
And really appreciate your honest answer. Am just hesitant to agree to something without knowing the facts.
---
There's fish in all lots of areas actually.  Most small ponds have them.
---
Yeah, I generally don't mind this build (I have Chinese Stealth Suit, too, so it's fun), but the lack of HR varieties have been bugging me.
---
Most shots I could get it to mod to were 4 shots, I think it was with the hair trigger? I had a bloodied 1* drop the other day I was pretty stoked about, until I noticed it was a LVL 20! I wound up putting it on a LVL 15 character I've got, so he'll have something deent for a little while before it's scripped out.
---
Its just the road map gives you the q4 sence . Its a mega technically cause they lable it as 2020 roadmap
---
Yeeeaaa....baby steps man...baby steps
---
Haven't noticed this one but PLEASE GOD NO!!!
---
I appreciate that there are still difficult events in the game. As a bloodied sneak rifleman build, it‚Äôs way too easy sometimes. And I agree with the guy who said Encryptid is not a training camp. Baa
---
What kinda weapon is it? Also pretty sure vampire and explosive can‚Äôt occur on the same weapon. Someone correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.
---
They can

When I was rep farming I got it frequently.. I was never able to save them.

I get them all the time

Another nice "clean modern" build. Do like the pool. 
---
Since Aqua's camps started getting popular and noticed, there's been an influx of this style of camp and am nearing the point of "meh".
---
The pillar walls have become almost a prerequisite. As with the white double walls.
---
I flipped through 6 servers looking for teams and things going on. It was sparse at best.
---
Great tip, did not know.
---
I recommend Fallout 69 things get really messy.
---
It looks like a sten gun but I'm pretty sure its been duped in because the textures are low quality and the animations are messed up.
---
I usually play when my husband plays but I have been on since beta and have logged 1300 hours. Yes, maybe I am done.
---
It's been my experience, having made ash piles at events where there were meat piles mixed in, that it doesn't effect the creator of the ash piles.  I can tesla all over the place, get a hefty mix of ash/meat, and suffer no framerate loss. But if I'm not using a tesla, 5-10 ash piles will cause pixellation, framerate drops, and movement lag.  Also, one ash pile can block access to 3-5 meat piles, and they persist after looting for some stupid reason. The last is also true of Plasma Goo.
---
Sounds like legendary perks have been confirmed for 22, in September
---
What? You serious?

You never forget your first! If I see a Port-A-Diner I have to give it one shot every time.

22 was the best. They set it in 2122 in the ruins of Detroit. Basically the gist was you have to re-invigorate America‚Äôs pre-war auto industry (bringing the Corvega, etc plants back to life, re-paving roads) I loved the ‚Äúcustomize your own wasteland vehicle‚Äù feature too. Final Boss was Henry House, Mr. House‚Äôs bastard son who was FEV‚Äôd into the largest behemoth ever. He controls all the manufacturing at the beginning of the game and you have to gradually wrestle away pieces from him until the final showdown. All the while keeping the BOS, and the Canadian Enclave off of your pre-war auto tech. 
---
I put so many good hours into that game, damn.
---
Thanks Im even more curious to what weapon it is now.
---
Lol. Been in for 1300 hours since beta. I know what an empty server looks like.
---
Wait, is that how you spell it?  German is so confusing to me.
---
If ten million bloatflies
---
It's a sad realization for sure. I am slowly getting to that point myself.
---
Exactly. Nocturnal Lead Pipe here.
---
I‚Äôm actually grateful for lockdown, I had probably sub 50 hours pre-lockdown. I‚Äôm now sitting at around 380 actually enjoyed the experience in comparison to when it launched.
---
Mostly agree with what you say, i'm a casual player a couple of hours per day, and I consistently only have 80-100 T-notes on me, that coupled with the game mechanic that I can only cash in 20 a day means that I have never run out of notes and had to do events to get more, one of the biggest arguments for increasing the note cap is to encourage players like myself to play more or to do more events in the time I do play.  
---
So when I do get on the game and there's a choice to do either the Earle or SBQ event, do I choose the "Earle" event knowing that i'l have to accept the grind for ammo, repairs after the event (even if it doesn't bug out), or do the SBQ which is easier to complete much less grind after the battle and equivalent rewards, if Earle gave repair kits as rewards then it would be  Earle every time (its new, fun and challenging).
---
My main reason is because the ash piles cover all the loot and don't disappear and every time there are ash pile my games goes all pixelated and lags to no end and sometimes crashes because of it. That only happens when there are ash piles.
---
No, you don't.  The only thing you lose out on is one chest at the top that can apparently have up to 500 caps.
---
I disagree. I have a few thousand atoms banked up, have fo1st, I just miss the rush of reward I guess. They could pay me in nuka cola and I would do it still. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
To play devil's advocate, I routinely camp hop between vendors with specific things in mind that I'm looking for. It's quite frustrating when there's one dude camped on the SAME machine the whole time I'm there
---
Thats my point exactly. I go in, all guns blazing and knifing. And yes I die. But the respawn timeout are a pain.
---
I meant more for the reason that ash piles cover loot piles and don't disappear so you can't get your loot
---
What's an Aqua camp??
---
Hey, I would recommend planting crops on top of campfires.  You can just build campfires under the lighting menu and then literally place crops on the top, to the side of them.  No need for dirt tiles.
---
I'll PM you
---
Pacifist is your friend.
---
I‚Äôm using the down time to finally explore the world stress-free and gather the lead and steel that my heavy guns so rapidly chew through until next season. It‚Äôs actually kind of nice and I don‚Äôt have to log in every single day
---
Last question and I will be 100% good on this, could you post like 1 or 2 pics of the back side and 1 or 2 pics on the inside?
---
It‚Äôs common for this to happen. Best to just put your junk away and bulk it later. Otherwise things like this will just keep happening.
---
To be fair...
---
They took something away from players.... That they were never obligated to provide players at all. Free premium currency. 
---
It's not really greed. It's entitlement. You used to get something for free.... Something that was a bonus, that they were not obligated to provide you, and you feel like you deserve to keep getting it. For free. 
---
And by you, I don't mean you specifically. I mean the proverbial you. The large group of players who feel cheated for not getting free atoms anymore.
---
That's why you don't *shoot back*
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Black_Knight
---
Yeah, it's really hard to have your stuff taken with pacifist on.
---
Sure. So from now on, since you got a bunch of gear out of it, that means you want *more* teams of level 200+ to attack you in workshops, right?
---
I've never had that issue personally, and I play on console.
---
It‚Äôs an unobtainable new weapon that has not been added yet i would get rid of it if I where you I wouldn‚Äôt risk the ban
---
Ok. So maybe not atoms if it makes people upset. But something. Just a thought.
---
Sure, give me 20mins :)
---
Also interested.
---
The other night somebody's Settler Wanderer was asleep in a FO1st tent at Fissure Prime.
---
You are the best if I could give 100 upvotes I would
---
Okay so I have a question. What is your main weapon? Or do you want to be your main weapon? Riflemen? Commando? Heavy gunner? 2 handed melee? 1 Handed melee? Or unarmed? Or Shotguns? Maybe even pistols? (Non auto or auto of course)
---
Aye! Agreed. Good game like but those are some worrying hours that're going into it
---
You have way too many QOL cards, need them to be damage and dr cards. Choose melee or shotgun, not both. If you want to carry the shotgun as back up, cool, but make it a "magic" one and put all points into the melee.
---
In other words a standard thing happened in the pvp part of this game so I'm going to whine in reddit
---
I have tried numerous times came close a couple times. I found sniping them was as close as I got but couldn't get the other one in time, so if your good at sniping from a distance might be the way to go.
---
I feel it disadvantages melee. For me personally power armor is a pain in the butt. I am a ranged sniper. Sometimes though Earl gets all bullet spongy and you get jack of that and really need to get up close
---
You can do both events and get both rewards, Nuke #1 drop on earl, do the event, nuke # 2 drop on Queen, have one person go to the mine before nuke drops, and play anchor for A colossal problem, this will start both events, the person playing anchor for the team, stays in the mine, but does not start the event.  ( so just hang out by the mine shaft drop area.) the queen must be killed within 5 minutes. Then everyone travel on the anchor guy and do the colossal event, if you cannot get inside play the team switcheroo by having people fast travel on person inside, then leaving the team starting a new public team then others can join team and get inside, nuke # 3 - repeat steps for nuke # 2.
---
I have yet to hear a definitive explanation on what ‚Äúmagic‚Äùweapons are. Yes I‚Äôve watched the turtle video. Yes I‚Äôve read all your half-assed explanations. I‚Äôm beginning to suspect it‚Äôs one of those words with no meaning like ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù, ‚Äúsynergy‚Äù, or ‚Äúthe internet of things‚Äù
---
I find myself using the shotgun the most. So I‚Äôd say that that‚Äôs my mainü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
All of those perks that don't do damage, you need to get rid of.  Can you use the mole miner gauntlet in power armor?  If you CAN'T, than it benefits from iron fist, not gladiator, if you CAN than it does benefit from gladiator. 
---
 
---
Regardless ANY PERK that you only technically need at one point in time, you need to switch out for damage perks and only switch in when doing that thing.
---
Picklock
---
Hard bargain 
---
Hacker
---
Armorer
---
Fix it good
---
That's 11 points to put into damage instead, netting 50% more damage.  Also only go for one type of damage, melee or shotgun, your choice.  Not both.
---
I mean we‚Äôre all still playing 76 so we all know a thing or two about lost causes
---
So, the issue may be less of diversifying my cards and more about focusing them?
---
Aqua is a very popular 76 camp builder. Aqua's camp entirely made of round pillar rooms and the next camp they did (white walled, modern , with pillar walls) started getting noticed in camp of the week content makers.

Though much of their newer stuff has gone towards more and more elaborate.

Hey, if you still have the marsupial mutation potion I could really use one, just lost mine being stupid right before I maxed starch genes

And Campfire Tales, if you pick up the wet kindling.

Keep in mind the wendigo spawns during earle fight has a high chance of dropping the ammo you are using, including ultracite ones.

Reading through this subreddit, it really seems like I'm the only person who crafts the SS armor the moment I get the module instead of waiting until I have a large pool of modules.

FO76 2020: a game you play to stay inside and avoid the aftermath of a bat virus plague.

I have had trouble with the critters for a while. I just server hop and they change targets. It was much worse before they fixed critter spawns. You couldnt find any ever of any critter. Not even the cats!
---
I mean legendary scorched
---
That's not how PSA works...
---
It was taking me maybe 10 mins so worth the move.
---
In strength you only have one gladiator perk, at level 2. You should have 3 all at level 3. Charisma is at 10 for a melee character, which could work, but would sacrifice other things. 
---
Go through your cards available and start working less on worrying about weight and inventory management and work more on being able to kill things quickly. 
---
The suggestion above you would change from a 15% damage deatlt, to 60%. 
---
I think bloody mess also helps in melee, and thats another 15% on top. Tenderiser and suppressor in charisma (6 total) would stop them from hurting yo I and help hurt them more. 
---
Mostly, you need to really just reevaluate what you want to do and how to get there.
---
Put on pacifist
---
It would probably take up like 20 lbs of inventory space
---
Event needs a minimum damage required to get rewards like Scorched Earth.
---
They literally did double score last week and are doing extra challenges right now.
---
3 hours collecting junk and you didn't once think to drop it in your stash?  That's like working on a school paper all day and never hitting F5.
---
Look into tenderizer and bloody mess as well
---
I have a Bloodied/50limb/+1P Hunting Rifle on PC if you're interested.
---
So long as they don't provide the same buff, you can reap the benefits of a number of recipes simultaneously, so I may very start cooking up some glowing meat to compliment my cranberry relish... or rather the other way around üòú

Food,  water, some screws, defend base frlm supermutants rinse and repeat.
---
It seems the writers did their research on plagues. Must be kind of weird for them now.
---
I haven't figured it exactly how, but there is a sequence of events that can result in Sofia following when you fast travel..this has happened to me five times.
---
It has something to do with fast traveling when she is talking to you, but possibly only certain lines if get dialogue.
---
It may happen with other allies too.
---
Bravo
---
And backpacks
---
Then by all means, what defines a PSA for you?
---
ClickedAgenda91
---
I love you!!!
---
Whenever a legendary drops out of sight, try fast traveling away and back. They usually reappear when I come back.
---
There's no need to reinvent the wheel at least for the food which goes for personal use (just give dat fridge 100% spoil protection over 50% we currently have) but i can see the point of ppl who want to sell food in their vending machines. Totally 100% aboard with suggestion.
---
True that. I also have a gladiator build, but getting up close and personal is a bad idea. So I die again... and again. And at that point, the 60 sec wait is a long one. You basically get punished for going at it.
---
Farm ammo, nuke the queen a couple times, start the encrypted event sell stuff repeat. Super fun tbh
---
honestly. recently out of 6 hours played i probably spend 30 mins doing events. and the rest of the time i'm sitting in my camp so people can buy serums (and whatever else) or giving people stuff or helping people.
---
Was a bit of an exaggeration. I can do it faster but it certainly takes newer players that much time.
---
Thank you. That's exactly what I'm talking about.
---
I appreciate it, but I'm not running a bloodied build, so I'm not sure I'd really utilize the gun to its full potential.
---
Don‚Äôt you dare compare these skins to the high quality fortnite ones
---
Not 3 paragraphs of griping.
---
Try to do the same thing to a level 12 and then started shooting at me. I just ignored the poor bastatd.
---
I get that it's a personal cool down. My question was why it doesnt tell you that before running the whole silo.
---
There are several quests that do this. The outcome is the same regardless of what you chose as options. Like finishing the vault 79 and it says you killed the ghoul, whether or not you did.
---
Yep, but even so, that's a terrifying amount of time to sink into a videogame.
---
Thanks for the tip! I'll try that (though sometimes it's a true challenge to find the spot again (especially for some of the horde quests). I noticed that this works great with instances nearby (load into the instance and then back out), but never thought about fast travelling.
---
As I said, I have the holotape. But the silo still let's you run the whole thing if you still have a personal cooldown. Hand scanner should also turn red if you personally cant launch a nuke.
---
Don't enter workshops and have pacifist mode on, dumbass.
---
All apart of the game bud. Scrap-kits, scrap box or your stash could solve this problem. This game still have pvp mechanics and has risk vs reward built in to it. If the game didn‚Äôt you‚Äôd essentially remove all challenge and reward of playing.
---
It \*does\* stay insofar as when you get out of your PA it's on. But when you're in the armour you're technically nude. You don't get any benefit from what you're wearing
---
Ok I'll be with you within a few hours
---
Lol what in the fuck
---
Yes! I was attacked by a swarm of boatflies at my workshop and one was legendary.  Absolutely no way to stop and loot it immediately.  I did find it. Yay, a pipe wrench.  BTW. Did they increase the glow on the dead fireflies bc they seem easier to spot now?
---
it feels like it was made by lolcats
---
Well...
---
1. Pack up all the scrap, purified water, etc. that I accumulated since yesterday and haul it off to a vendor to sell for my daily 1400 caps.  If I'm at the limit, I try to find something to spend money on to make room.
---
2. Do the settler, raider, overseer, and ally daily quest, purchase 200 gold for treasury notes, buy/sell script to keep that going.  Do forgotten technology quest if I have found a technical document.
---
3. Check my daily/weekly challenge list, knock out what of that I can.
---
4. Log out around 11:30am to 12:30pm to avoid the bug where challenges autocomplete if you happen to be logged in during this window.
---
5. Putter about the C.A.M.P. for a bit.  Curate magazine/bobblehead collection.  Curate hat/outfit collection.  Toy with the idea of collecting teddy bears then discard it as I don't have the space.
---
6. Server hop for a bit trying to find the random Responder vendor bot to see if it has anything interesting for sale.
---
7. Explore the areas on the map I haven't already explored.  Mostly down to Watawga now.  Bring back junk to scrap, empty the water purifiers, etc. in preparation for tomorrow.
---
8. Repeat?
---
So now explain how someone finishes the board early without doing more than someone that finishes on schedule?
---
Honestly just doing whatever I feel like at that given time. In the past few days I‚Äôve sought out my missing possum badges, went on a massive junk expedition, nuked whitesprings for levels, did the commanders ally missions and rebuilt my entire camp. 
---
I think this game is very similar to titles like minecraft or sea of thieves, in the sense that the fun lasts as long as you keep enjoying it however you want to.
---
This new machine shouldn‚Äôt even exist. Ammo should just be sellable or scrapable
---
Yes, there is, just google fo76 atlas or whatever and you should be able to find the date
---
This game is broke don‚Äôt ask for new things till they actually fix the shit that‚Äôs been broke sense Bata.
---
Me too, i usually die from a wendigo spawn that was hiding waiting for me to loot his fallen bedridden so he could sneak up behind me and kill me while im not paying attention, i then respawn outside the mine
---
just had this done to me
---
Yes, occasionally.
---
Exactly what I was thinking but add a big display on the side of ii so the terminal would be only used when programing the message.  And yes I was thinking that the free personal terminal that just sits unused in all my camps might be used for the same purpose.  I also thought the personal terminal should be used for messages from the overseer, stuff like meat week coming in a week or claim your prizes from the ledgendary run because the board leaves tomorrow. üôÇ
---
First thing I see is your perks don‚Äôt really match you weapons.
---
If you are going to run melee (the MM gauntlet) then you need to add points to strength.
---
Do you have the 3rd blade on the gauntlet?
---
martial artist will increase your swing speed, thus number of hits you make.
---
At your level, you have probably picked most locks you need to - swap out those for either defensive or offensive perks; swap out if you really feel the need to picks a lock.   Perhaps boost your rifle perks.
---
same with hard bargain - swap it out when you are buying selling from bots, otherwise, keep a different perk equipped.
---
You do not have starched genes or class freak.  Are you not mutated?  Twisted muscles will give you +25% damage on your melee weapons, but will also reduce ballistic accuracy (bad for shotguns) - so classfreak2 (at a minimum.) to offset that.  Starched genes2 to prevent losing the mutation from consuming radaway.
---
Use FixitGood3 when you repair armor and power armor, and weaponsmith3 for weapons.  (Repairs them to 200%.)  no need to keep fixit good equipped all the time.  Swap it for something like nerd rage, which helps you in low health.  Ditto armorer.
---
recraft your X01 to level 50.  Add motion assist servos to the torso (+2 STR). 
---
Consider vampire weapons.
---
double barrels do decent damage, reload time may be part of what‚Äôs hurting you in high level zones.   Have you cmpared that 2x barrel to something like a combat shotgun?  Much higher fire rate.

If you find yourself in a position that breaks the agreement then the best thing to do (in the case of public playtesting) is simply to stop taking part in it. Should anyone somehow have a problem with the new situation you're in (which is unlikely, but never say never) then you'll be able to show when your last session was and they'll be able to confirm that via server logs. Nothing goes further than that as the burden of proof is upon the complainant.
---
76 forces you to choose a specific weapon type and firefight tactic. The bloodied sneak commando (for an easy example) plays on sneaking to multiply your damage and avoid incoming damage. There's many, many options to choose from so pick a play STYLE that you enjoy, pick a weapon TYPE you like, and then find a way to do damage/penetrate armor/take tons of or avoid damage all together. I play low health and vampire's/bloodied weapons. I'm not ultra optimized into any specific build but I am constantly shuffling my perk cards around.
---
Mutations can make or break your build. Pay attention to the positives and the negatives. Best advice: watch youtube videos for build advice and testing.
---
Preciate you. I always like to keep full scrip for them but I wanna roll some ss armor.

not the point

Agh I knew I should have held off on Wastelanders quest lines till they were more polished...

I watched a YouTube video and at the end Rara didn‚Äôt hate the guy playing. There was definitely a difference in dialogue... I wonder what causes this bug? (Waiting on a reply in a ticket about resetting the quest. Fairly certain if she hates me she won‚Äôt get the slug buster for me.)

Here ya go try this out. When looking for shotguns try for the something such as a Junkies Pump Action. This build will increase your damage with any normal shotgun but the junkies part will make it wayyyy better. You should go to player vending machines a search for mutations aswell! I don‚Äôt really know which to use for a full health build but you could look it up. As for your armor look for Vanguard Armor. It increases your dmg resist by 35 for each piece the higher your health. Now for the junkies part to kick in, you have to get ADDICTED to different drugs and alcohol. You only need to be addicted to 5. Try to stay away from anything that‚Äôll give you -1 through -10 strength. Good luck! :)

I don‚Äôt really see how that truly nerfs rifles, though. Yes, they can use both vats and sneak, sure. But at the same time, higher weapon weight doesn‚Äôt really affect the power of the weapon. It just means you can‚Äôt carry more than a few of them. It doesn‚Äôt make them less powerful. It just makes them a frustration if you‚Äôd like to play with multiple rifles to experiment with.

1. why is it unfair and/or greedy to be rewarded for effort put in? No one said free anything , time and effort are worth something. 
---
2. how is it ‚Äúfree‚Äù if time has to be spent earning the atoms after putting in effort to finish early?
---
3. they originally told us all cosmetics can be bought by earning atoms in game, they have since changed it and limited our ability and choice of atoms. how is it greedy to want to be able to buy the items as promised?
---
4. If the majority of items are cosmetic only, and no unfair advantage would be gained, how is it unfair that people can earn those rewards through effort (and honestly even if they were game changing, if you‚Äôre putting in effort how is that unfair)
---
5. As we have a lack of content, still, why is there anything greedy or unfair for asking for incentive to support the game?
---
Your argument still is based on the ideals of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want people to be able to work and get something I‚Äôm not willing to work for myself‚Äù, it‚Äôs still based on entitlement and laziness.
---
For you to argue for ‚Äúunfair‚Äù you need to provide two sides to the argument and show how one side gets an advantage that the other side simply has no way of achieving, and even that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean unfair (e.g. someone who simply cannot play except once a week is at a disadvantage but not an unfair one as it is not Bethesda‚Äôs fault people have work schedules)
---
Didn‚Äôt see it then, and most people probably didn‚Äôt either. There‚Äôs nothing explicitly wrong with reposts, especially unknowing ones.

I think you might be only a handful of players that would, but who knows.

I have both in my vendor, will be on again in about an hour if you want to buy them.

I made a new character at the beginning of the lockdown here in Italy, I am lvl 255 now, 10/10
---
The best way to thank that person is to do the same for a new player. I'm level 406 and I try and help out a new player when ever I can either it be giving them ammo, armor, weapons. The last person I helped, I built their camp.

Welcome

Submit a ticket requesting a compensation in Atoms. 
---
The Customer Support personnel do **not** have a tool to add SCORE, and they‚Äôve been instructed to stop escalating such requests. 
---
However, they *do* have a tool to add Atoms. Make that your request instead.
---
Yes I know this glitch. But I don't like it... It is ugly for me
---
Improved LOD, more cluttered environments, larger map, more locations that aren't loaded in a separate interior cell. I'm not gonna bust out a calculator and quantify what "16x the detail" means, but 76 is a marked visual improvement to 4 compared side-by-side
---
Does it work? Last time I asked they just said sorry and didn‚Äôt do anything, even after asking for compensation
---
It's been there for ages.
---
Still a cute thing to find.
---
Hopefully you adjust your approach so this doesn't happen again.
---
20lbs each lol I always do this
---
Did you ask for SCORE or for Atoms?
---
I know one person that was successful. And prior to the Legendary Run, both times I had autocompletion they awarded me the accompanying Atoms.
---
Send in a screenshot; that may help.
---
4k instead of 720p? That would be 16x the detail.
---
There's a learning curve to the fight. Took me about 3 fights to properly adapt. Finished my last one last night with only four of us... Myself lvl570, two lvl200 and a level 75.. Easily the easiest one of the 8 I did yesterday.

---
If we‚Äôre going to have breaks between seasons they‚Äôll have to do something, it could be nice if dailies each had their own reward, even if they weren‚Äôt atoms. 
---
One that gives scrip, one gold, one caps, one a lunch box, one a scrap/repair kit, and if you do 5 you get a perk pack.  Or just flat out give us coins for the perk cards.
---
Some incentives would be nice.  It helps motivate players by giving focus to a play session, especially when in such a content rut like we‚Äôre in

It means they can render a lot more objects on screen compared to Fallout 4. Compare the draw distances between the games and you'll notice that 76's is significantly better. Look around inside some of the buildings in Fallout 4 that are not instanced and you'll notice they are almost completely barren, barely any clutter inside of them, because the engine couldn't handle any more extra objects in that cell. Fallout 76 on the other hand doesn't struggle with that.
---
Hmmm, I‚Äôve done 5 or 6 now and haven‚Äôt had an issue. Do you usually have connection issues?
---
I just asked for compensation, not anything in specific
---
It looks like how Biv talks
---
United Kingdom not sure what that is lol, user is DonkVW and thank you
---
I hope Bethesda will also see this :P, I know it will with the eyes closed.
---
&gt;Nice dude and all, but there are better things to look at.
---
That made me laugh. Always did crater so I could sell to foundation for that extra rep. The grind is real.
---
You joke but there is a bug where every intractable object in the game inherits the name of a player on your team.
---
Not the good ones for sure
---
It really sucks when a ten ton bat disappears
---
Um I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs the armory or the other one like it. I don‚Äôt think the medical or science sell it
---
I am a non bloodied player. I have same experience trying healing factor, instant ft issues, and never used it again. When i get the fast travel bug on rare occasion, i notice a sliver of dark between the white and red of my health bar. Using a rad away and a stimpack usually cures it and allows me to travel as normal.
---
My impression of the ft bug is it is tied to a fraction of health that prevents the travel similar to not being able to travel while taking damage. The sliver of black is like it cant decide to round up or down. Would explain healing factor making it 10x worse, adding that feature onto a fractional health computation issue. And it makes sense to trigger not being able to fast travel, game doesnt know if your taking damage or healing or what til that sliver/fraction is dealt with. 
---
In summation, playing with health/rads always fixes my ft bug. But again, in my experience as a non bloody non healing factor player. Id be interested if anyone else has noticed something similar?
---
It's not the event that is the problem. Across the board all throughout the game Assaultrons are bugged. Encryptid was already stressful. Fighting against a bugged one makes it even worse.
---

How about another triple XP weekend.
---
Im excited they added a skill battle to the game
---
And Brenda has a Cameo in the Background too!
---
What a time to be ghoulish
---
I think there's some truth to this.  I always roll 10 or so at a time and I hadn't picked up on the pools, but I did notice multiples of the same prefix weighted heavily towards mutants or troubleshooters
---
It used to be this way before these last few patches. Team PvP was life.
---
We probably need a video proof. After it would be logical that they send us about 150 or 300 atoms to at least buy a rank or two.
---
If you're a bloodied unarmed build which is what the mole miner guy probably was then that fight does take the only arrow out of your quiver. I literally have a vampires gun just to survive in the fight

I'm pretty sure Spruce knob is the highest point on the map.

Also the majority of the good stuff on the trading networks is duped, so what's your point?

Been a bug for a long time. Thats why we have a extra 2 dailies per day then we were originally suppose to.

That's the legendary run bundle.

Bro teslas are easy to counter fly with the jetpack and if you need to land equip refractor. Its all in the build

I was lucky enough to get one after only two previous attempts at the rusty pick. Then I come across a guy who had a few of them for 75 caps each so I bought another one lol

---
Boss fights are supposed to be hard.
---
I know it's painful. My alt is an archer, but since Archery and Commando perks both use PER I switch it around once in a while, so I have a bunch of rifles on my wall.
---
The nerf per se is that you would have to dedicate to one or two rifles and keep it fed with ammo, instead of spreading over several calibers.
---
I have felt like it Was already like that before the Patch. Plus i dont want to wait another 5 Minutes after i found a Match just for the Match to start.
---
I mean im Not into battle royale i dont like it, but this nuclear winter Thing is really the "best" out of All.

I have played like three matches, though in adventure im lvl 167 so nothing against the game just against the Mode üòÇ

Ppl need to drop the nuke away from the mine so that the edge of the nuke zone barely covers the mine so that ppl can atleast have a chance to get away, if you die and end up outside you won't have a chance to change your armor in time.

50 runs and no problems, except a few when someone starts shooting with a Tesla, but I quickly stell them to put it away hoping they listen. (PS4 pro SSD).

What are you on i might have a good explosive shotty i can sell pretty cheap. Ive mostly move to gauss shottys but kept a bunch of my good regular ones.

I keep my CAMP simple.    
---
My personal building is small and locked. No reason to go in you can look through the window.    
---
My other building is two stories. Bottom level is the workshop, brewery, and kitchen stove. Second level is the store with a PA station. Out back is a fenced in garden for myself and another smaller community garden for anyone who stops by. A couple of rain barrels but you better boil that mess. Three water purifiers and my generatior is raised and walled in.

My char takes a quick nap for the XP boost, check my email for new quests, head over to Biv to hopefully learn a new alcohol recipe.

Max rep with the Raiders as of last night so now the focus is on Foundation. It will take a while to get max with them and I need the farming plots asap.    
---
My stash is almost full. I have to go through, take everything out, prioritize, and sell/dump the rest. Side note: I'm on PC and 99% of my plans are for free. I prefer the new players to get them but I want them gone.

There's a punch bowl wth some drinks in it and NO Nukashine you have my word.

I'm just N of the Wayward along the river. I'm usually on at night roughly 7p.m.-ish CST.
---
Hey! I made this post not too long ago!
---
and yes, they should drop repair kits. I see no purpose in dropping millions of nukes just to get a shovel.
---
I missed quite a few level up challenges, and never touched a single NW challenge throughout the season and I‚Äôm even with Zorbos.  I even missed full days of challenges while on vacation.  Out of all the ‚Äúbattle passes‚Äù I‚Äôve done, this one has been the easiest.
---
preach it. I don't know how they don't know that yet.
---
Never carry junk on you, always store it asap especially if it is bulk, bulk it and store it. The bulk is stupid, it automatically puts it in your personal inventory instead I think it should go into your stash.
---
I log in, switch server as my camp cannot be placed, check event/build teams, join a team, 
---
get the faction dailies done, the challenges which aren‚Äôt auto completed, doing some events, if I‚Äôm too lazy myself I hope for someone launching a nuke on SBQ or ACP. Get the 150 scrip, 200 bullion.
---
Log out.
---
If an Event like meat week is live I don‚Äôt log out and take the drums all night long doing my part.
---
That headache drives her crazy and drives her everywhere
---
I disagree. All that means is that you need to swap what weapon you‚Äôre using once in a while. I can‚Äôt speak for commandos, since I haven‚Äôt played with any automatic except the handmade, but for my rifleman, I can easily switch between a few guns by putting up the ones I don‚Äôt need for a bit and collecting the ammo for all of them. I just can‚Äôt carry them on me with my pitiful 3 strength and the fact that I don‚Äôt play bloodied.
---
For commandos, it probably is a bit stronger of a nerf, but with the ammo factory legendary perk coming out and the ammo converter and ammo machine for the camp, I don‚Äôt see this as being a massive issue.
---
Side note - with colossal problem and the daily ops, contextual ammo drops based on your equipped weapon is a thing. That means that if an enemy takes 6 bullets to kill, they have a chance to drop 30 or so (assuming the numbers I‚Äôve seen in colossal hold for dailies), including ultracite rounds (note - the six bullets was an example. It‚Äôs always 30 or so rounds from what I‚Äôve seen). Knowing this, the event can be farmed relatively easily for ammunition.
---
I have a Brotherhood Recon Rifle I've been using since before level 50. This one is 114 now and it's fire rate is SO SLOW.    
---
I prefer having a long range rifle for taking out enemies before they know I'm there but I don't think the lever action has a suppressor mod. This 3 star one only does 188 damage.    
---
I would like a Sniper rifle type to replace the other one that does a lot more damage.
---
It kind of is the point... the only consequence to death in this game is dropping junk and it‚Äôs entirely avoidable.
---
I have 800 screws and they just take about 20 lbs in the stash.
---
The importance of screws lies in learning weapon mods. Craft a bunch, scrap a bunch, each weapon takes screws but scrapping doesn't give any back.
---
Thanks to a colossal problem, the market value of screws has fallen straight into the ground. You can easily walk out of the mine with hundreds and hundreds of screws.
---
I really miss those days. I had the chainsaw, and bloodied ripper and handy saw. All of them absolutely tore enemies up.
---
I kept the ripper and handy hoping someday they will buff/break again.
---
It's extremely easy to get scrip, I have to drop the vast majority of my legendaries.
---
Most of the stuff on trading subreddits is definitely not duped.
---
Seneca rocks i think. Just a lil at the west of it, there's a big ass mountain. Alot of players try to build camp there.
---
New servers are spun up or offloaded based on player count. That‚Äôs how AWS works. The only way for you to truly see empty servers is if they had a fixed number of servers and spred players across them. This just isn‚Äôt the case. 
---
Maybe people aren‚Äôt playing in teams, but I can guarantee you they are not empty. That‚Äôs just not how server populating works in this game.
---
Nice try. If I remembered the name of the song or lyrics I‚Äôd help you out.
---
9/11, nice
---
Damn, my bad
---
Well at least you have a few to complete, I'm at 11/11 dailies and am missing out on 2.5k+ points. Whining here won't make any difference though, Bethesda is busy adding more bugs to the game at this time.
---
Edit: F\*\*\* you Bethesda
---
This bug has hit me twice. I'm sure almost everyone was hit at least once. When the Season first started there was 7 dailies. When the bug started affecting a lot of people they did patch that fixed the bug for the majority but it still happens to a few. They also added 2 more dailies to help out the people that have been affected bring the daily challenges to 9 each day. An extra 500 possible points each day. This bug has really sucked for us as a community and I'm sure its been a huge thorn in the side at Bethesda. At least they tried to  rectify it by giving us extra. FYI: Once the season is over I heard the chicken coop will be available from the settlers for gold bullion.
---
That would be amazing, especially now that we have public teams and lunch boxes.
---
9/11. The Build Walls challenge is half done because last time it was only 5/5.
---
I was inside Monongah Mine waiting in ACP. Maybe being in an instanced interior at reset time is one of the causes?
---
How exactly do you think servers are populated? 8000 people on steam alone right now.
---
They don‚Äôt care and it‚Äôs all about them.
---
Yet here we are on the 30th, with no fix and Lady whatever sounding like the last girl that ghosted me
---
Yeah I am a junk guy and vendor hopping has just been disappointment since Earle lol. Screws everywhere.
---
Spruce Knob is IRL the highest place in West Virginia, there's a sign near where Samuel stays the whole day that says so.
---
In game it might not be true, or while true it might not look like it because Foundation is in the middle of the Divide, with a kind of natural progression, while Seneca Rocks is directly above Morgantown which is much lower than the rest of the Divide, and not on a walkable path, so the perspective might play the trick.
---
There isn't one
---
True but they are the first to complain at the slightest inconvenience too.
---
It doesn't exist
---
This was patched a long time ago or is this back again ?
---
It's appealing to me but I'm generally not the highest dps. Bloodied melee at ~40% hp. Don't even run through a full weapon durability during the event if it starts at 200%. Spend the whole time killing wendigos the second they spawn then spamming crouch jump hitting the boss. I come out with more stimpaks, purified water, radaway, and junk than I come in with. 
---
I think it's worth it if you do that "bug" where you nuke for ACP then nuke for the SBQ and it opens up ACP at the same time. This way 3 nukes would mean 3 ACPs and 2 SBQs. Once they fix that bug, then yeah SBQ is less effort for rewards. ACP is a much funner experience though cause SBQ is very unfun for me just due to waiting for her to land...
---
I can probably in an hour or so
---
Ouh nice im on my way for 1k scrip. Hope fully Fortuna will be on my side this time.
---
I dont know about moping, but sweeping parts off the floor when im dont is a requirement.
---
Exactly.
---
FO76 players are just a representation of real world people.  There are a lot of folks out there who just like to watch the world burn.  Ignore them, even when they act like bratty children, born broken.
---
Better than you press "join Event" and your console just freezes. Happened 3 out of 3 Times i wanted to join. Wont do this shit again, sbq here i come again.
---
I‚Äôm lvl 269 and they have stole from me giving stuff to my wife and daughter. Greedy that‚Äôs all I can say about them.
---
Same here, crashed 3 out of 3 Times i tried to join. Ps4 Not pro here.
---
Season 2 is gonna be a more painful experience I fear... I am 100% sure this same exact bug is gonna persist in the next season.
---
Comedy gold bullion.
---
I honestly thought that part of the community had left because the past month and a half I've been doing what I do and giving free excess to low level players and not had a problem until today. 
---
As for the ignoring, that's not as fun as passive aggressive payback...
---
I can give it to you now if you like
---
Why pay anything?    
---
It should be an option common sense.
---
Do you know how long the personal timers are? I guess I have never launched them that quick in succession to realize a block.
---
Greed in a game with caps on all currency makes no sense though am I right. Still I hope you got payback
---
Can‚Äôt, busy for the next few hours. Can MSG you when I‚Äôm GTG
---
The best approach is to go to low levels‚Äô camps and drop the items in front of them. If you put 0 caps items in your vending machines or drop paper bags at train stations, most likely someone else other than the needy will grab them. It‚Äôs like donating to big effing ‚Äòcharity‚Äô companies, 99.9% of your donations goes to the super-rich.
---
Scary. He will just change server and learn nothing.
---
Ok then I wont be available until 4 or 5
---
I did when I lost 9k in a single day, and they said "we're not allowed to send atoms because the team is still discussing a way to compensate affected players", then closed my ticket and were never heard from again. 
---
It's really sad how they feel entitled to treat their customer when this bug has exiated for a whole year, but very conveniently was never fixed because the challenges used to give out atoms. The burdens always fall on the players.
---
I would rather they stop producing new things that don't work, and spend some time fixing existing bugs - particularly combat-related bugs like rubberbanding, repeated 95% VATs misses, frame rates, etc.  Fix game breaking things first.  
---
But as long as people give Bethesda a pass, letting Todd say dismissive stuff like 'it just works', buying 1st and atoms with real world money, there is no real incentive for them to do anything than weak attempts.
---
Ive got alot of script to burn and only need 2 or 3 peices of armor, so ill definitely work on that for you id like to test the theory. Lol tired of getting odd rolls.
---
Just people who want to steal people‚Äôs junk instead of getting it all themselves, lazy so and so‚Äôs. it‚Äôs annoying.
---
See for places like that I like to make sure I pack an orbital strike beacon just for that type of emergency.. Serenity Now Suffer later
---
I did a trade for it and got it on my next colossal problem üò¨
---
I sell junk so screws were never a problem for me.
---
Encryptid was already a pain in the ass before assaultrons became bugged. Reverting them back to what they were would change assaultrons as a whole, but not the difficulty of that one event.
---
&gt; I'm almost ready to switch to a lever-action
---
Go for it, there is no better rifle. And it's the reason most of us scrip the hunting rifle.
---
Doesn‚Äôt work in Power armour :(
---
anything you see out in the wild. like a battery or tin can or a gun/armour etc is whoever gets it first. 
---
but anything that is in a container (or thing) is personal. So everyone can get something
---
Agree. Also the Queen is more fun with all different types of enemys to distract you. Fed up with Wendigos already.
---
Exactly. Why not just have them permanently keep the legendary aura when they spawn/die?
---
Usually how it works lol.
---
I try to do that, but it just so happens my camp is in Flatwoods to try and attract the lower levels (It has everything they need including crops for food if they like) and I was scrapping items when they both walked up so I made them some soup and done my drop, before I knew it in comes Mr high level with his yoink mode on full force.
---
You're right about that donation though I never drop in stations or 0 cap anything anymore.
---
Thanks, I think I might just try one of the other rifle types.
---
The strike beacons work on camps?
---
Maybe I've just had bad luck, but I haven't noticed any change; it always takes forever to get into a match. Could just be me though.
---
The other 3 people in my group managed to get onto his friend list so we can have some more fun for a while. And before he changes server we just left him in a solo ACP instance... (We are this petty)
---
Did you report it to Bethesda?
---
Fireflies, Owl City
---
There is an indicator under your ap meter a red weapon icon will appear when you wea0on is close to breaking same with armor.
---
I think someone managed to make a character that looks just like him. Pretty easy from there, his clothes are available in game.
---
Hey when you guys help people do they have mics?

Stop dying so much.

Who are you? Good guy from the Wasteland?
---
These interactions keep the game going. If you want to give items safely, trade. 
---
If you place them in the vending machines for zero, then, they are for the first to take them. If you leave them on the floor, they are loot. 
---
Let assholes be assholes. I like having them in the game. We need them, since not even raiders are nasty anymore.
---
Yeah, hunting rifles are fun, but not super powerful.
---
Fell through the world as I was looting.
---
Well, 5 rounds is the standard capacity.
---
Large mag gives you +2 capacity, and swift and stinging both give you +1.
---
I guess with a quad star, you could conceivably get a 22-round capacity.
---
oh that's why all my stuff in my camp had another players name on it for about a minute. i was all, oh hell nah that's my stuff!
---
happened to me too.  I haven‚Äôt played ACP since - just not worth the aggravation
---
Did not see any options to do that. Was hoping this little video would catch their eyes.
---
No, it‚Äôs a server cooldown. Hence why you can server hop nukes.
---
Oh i think you're right. I haven't fact checked your statement, but when I send on top of Seneca rocks, with my 200mm i can clearly see that Source Know is quite elevated.
---
I guess I haven't found a mod I've desperately needed to spend hours crafting and scrapping the same gun over and over again ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I only collect enough fiberglass and screws to reach the cap limit. Next time I fight Earl, I just kill without looting.
---
Welp won‚Äôt be getting anything during this event being this is first time I will fail event only 3 level 40 to 69 showed up. If they would take care of spawns I could take earl
---
Reddit: we need a penalty to dying
---
Also reddit: remove the penalty of dying!
---
Each game is independent of each other.
---
Lore, common sense and laws of physics have been thrown out the window for this game. (Shoot an Opossum and he backflips)
---
I did get a nice chuckle out of some of the other responses.
---
Ya know I think I was in the overseers house? Maybe?
---
Generally I visit people's camps for ammo, do the odd event when it pops up, help raiders/settlers I find out and about in the wasteland and gain rep then kill them once they have outlived their usefulness
---
I only carry fertilizer and toilet paper when I go shopping..
---
The death timer is on purpose.
---
Im jot a jar head i dont need to be told what to think lol
---
That's good about the chickens at least lol.
---
I was setting up my new PC and managing my MS account to import some Xbox stuff over. Seeing the FO1st sub details made me think, *wow, I have a few outfits and convenience in almost a year.* 
---
I need to let 76 sit for a while. It‚Äôs fun, but I honestly don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôve done in the 2 years I‚Äôve been playing it as my main game.
---
Stop standing so close to Earle and equip Blocker 3 and you'll stop dying so much.
---
How does dying so much correlate with dying last minute (UNFORTUNATELY) .
---
OH YES THANK YOU.
---
I thought my controller was malfunctioning. 
---
Opening the Pipboy stops the unintentional firing.
---
Explosive bait works well for trap bases.
---
Note: does not work in power armor
---
The frustration is unreal. Got hit today, 4th time. Hopefully I can grind out a rank tonight, but it‚Äôs just stupid and ridiculous to still be dealing with this problem!
---
How long is the personal cooldown for launching a nuke?
---
I'm not talking about alot , I'm talking about last minute death.
---
You ever try born survivor 1, blocker 3, and fireproof 1 + asbestos chest mod? As long as you don't get one shot twice in 20 seconds you will have quite a lot more survivability.
---
It's really not tbh.  I use a vampire heavy weapon and don't die while standing under the falling embers and being attacked by earle at the same time.
---
It's just point and shoot
---
I saw you in another post being a troll dude, why?
---
By saying i mis spoke lol that was real helpfull
---
I often carry a few bait mines just for these kinds of camps. Call me criminal but I love to see their camp crumble!
---
When you put it there ? And yeah it was patched
---
Also, they won‚Äôt do anything to help you. No atoms, score or anything
---
Only on the health bar Earle is currently on. So if you make to the second only the second health bar refills. Pretty sure Todd would call that a competitive feature. I call it B.S. but all enemies do it in the game, not just Earle.
---
Down the rocks from my C.A.M.P is a dog hovering around a dead couple, dog bowl, leash and cooking station. It's sad really üòî It also seems tiny compared to the other doggos.
---
And even then you had to wait for community mods for the game to get *really* enjoyable.
---
The amount of ammo I used when me and 3 players only showed up. They where level 56, 87, 95. We took his first bar half way then I died and when I came back his health was full again so I assume he was on second bar already. That was not the case. I left the event with 4 minutes left and a full bar. I wasted enough ammo.
---
Yeah but during a event I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good feature. Such bullshit.
---
I don‚Äôt carry any junk and when i die to a trap camp I go back to pay them a visit, they always get a handsome repair bill.
---
I expect that the root answer is: because they can.  :(
---
I‚Äôm a Vamps Hvy but use my Quad Lever ALL the time for clearing out trash!
---
Literally this. Especially when you have to craft a metric ton of Gauss weapons or armor with legendary modules to get a good roll. You'll burn through a bunch real quick.
---
This is awesome.  I always wondered if a more modern style was doable. This is a reL inspiration! 
---
Amazing job.
---
Yesssssss
---
I do know that each faction has three quests which are longer before the game tells you. From what I've been told you should do all quests up to that point for each faction.    
---
I sided with the Raiders the first time b/c my main uses a lot of ammo as a Stealth Rifle build. I got max rep last night with them and now have to work on the Settlers.    
---
If you want, there is a list of items they offer for sale with each rep level. Not a spoiler but  you should look into them before deciding.
---
I‚Äôm starting to think I have high luck irl. The first time I played fallout 4, I got the pie first try and was so confused why none of the others worked. In 76, I‚Äôve got about 20 now, even with low luck. Almost always within the first 3 tries. The feeling doesn‚Äôt go away! I used to display all of them but it‚Äôs a bit much now haha
---
What was hilarious was my daughter went right up to him and one shot him dead.
---
yeah, unfortunately that‚Äôs pretty lore friendly but i don‚Äôt think it would be too far of a stretch if you could scavenge for some new tunes in a record shop or something. could be a cool little quest to go get them and deliver them to the radio host
---
It won‚Äôt let me dm you so my gt is kingsites12 just hit me up when on
---
Yesterday.  Unless it was patched last night it should be working
---
Yes but you probably tried twice that plus just walikig over to the machine. I got 2 at the legendary vender out of maybe 10 just good luck but if its not working for you why bother?
---
Could be, I haven't seen anybody else mention being in an instance.
---
In the past weeks, I've been deliberately online during the reset, but always either in the world or non-instanced interiors. Tomorrow, I'll check out the Overseer's house to see if the bug could be triggered.
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10/?prod=1129&amp;cat=28&amp;session=L2F2LzEvdGltZS8xNTk4ODA2NTA1L2dlbi8xNTk4ODA2NTA1L3NpZC9mVVVOeFlHVWVZbUpreFBDaG9mWGNsYlU5djRoNGg1c3RFYWxYUHZMNzJuSzlyYkcwMUdtXyU3RTJCdlJzcjBDR0pFbkx6Szkzc3I1MzFsJTdFczJkbXY0djVVT01yRWlERXVYX2NRaE5pQ1NGMnAyNzNETlREWVRVbEVRJTIxJTIx
---
Unlucky. Going on now.
---
I'm personally way behind because I was out for a few weeks. Been trying to catch up, but yeah, just not enough points to earn in order to finish in time. I think it might just be time to accept your fate. Kinda sucks, but such is life.
---
I wouldn't mind if you could convince them though, so good luck!
---
whole team shouldn't be dead then
---
No I don't but I'll give it a go. I do currently have blocker 3 and born survivor
---
that last level's bundle contains 500 atoms, so you can if you want too. the legendary run is supposed to end when Zorbo gets to the end
---
Originally from Kentucky, can confirm this.  Ohio river irl way more disgusting than in game version.  Fish probably have more rads as well.
---
This bug seems to happen a lot when the daily challenges are reset for the next day.  So avoid playing when the reset happens helps avoid this bug.
---
Yeah I completely agree. But when they‚Äôre only level 50 to 90 what am I supposed to do. I‚Äôm focusing on earl they needed to do spawns but no then when I would get swarmed with 10 of them it was game over. I‚Äôm bloodied I take two hits I‚Äôm dead
---
No worries! Not everyone has been to Seneca Rocks.
---
Around another week, just get a few more challenges done
---
LOL what a wanker
---
i got ported out and died from rads &gt;&lt;
---
While I've always felt that legendaries came in certain groups, your "pools" are spot on. I crafted six secret service chest pieces last night, hitting the craft button as fast as the server would accept. I received two mutant slayers, two ghoul slayers, and two unyielding. All but one were three stars.
---
Huh. I coulda sworn...
---
Buy them again and sell them at a loss in your vending machine.
---
Someone should start a list of known players that do it. Nothing worse using your ammo ect at low level collecting stuff, just for a lazy 200+ player to steal it.
---
Do you die cause you straight up get one shot or do you die cause the DoT is quicker than the stim heal? I also replaced tenderizer 3 with field surgeon 2 and team medic 1 (shared), so that can be helping as well. I didn't die my last fight but I will try again tonight.
---
You know, having those glaring spelling mistakes when you‚Äôre calling me a jarhead is hilariously ironic. 
---
When and where did you serve, by the way?
---
I have not opened one as of yet...are they tradeable/sellable? I don't have people to play with and would hate for them to just sit and not be used.
---
Hey sandman illundis we found the foodbuild lul.
---
Not tradeable, but if you open them around other players, they get the effects too.
---
As long as you land a shot
---
Get oneshot
---
oooh, nice. wasn't aware of that. thanks.
---
yeah I was just worried that it ended tomorrow. would be a slap in the face considering I'm level 99 right now.
---
thanks anyway.
---
OHHH ok. thank you for the info
---
If you and another person damage an enemy you both get to loot it‚Äôs corpse. Whatever loot YOU see, is not the same as the other person. So if the super mutant you killed has ammo, a laser rifle and caps, the other person probably got caps, hunting rifle, and junk items. 
---
Be aware that in order to loot the scorchebeast queen, each player has to do a minimum of 1,000 damage on her in order to loot her body and get credit. Other than that, mostly every enemy you slightly damage is able to be looted by you. 
---
I‚Äôve also notice that if I follow a random player and he kills an enemy, I‚Äôm not able to loot it at all. 
---
However if you‚Äôre following a teammate (private or public team) and you guys are very close to each other, you CAN loot the enemy even if you didn‚Äôt damage them at all. Gf and I tested it out. But you have to be within 15 feet of your teammate. 
---
Now about the care package thing you mentioned. If you called a package using the US requisition, then only ONE person can loot that chest. If somebody else beats you to it, it will be empty for you. When my brother was a low level and he got his first U.S requisition quest, i went ahead and picked the lock for him. But when I did, I got a bounty, and when I looted the junk my brother said there was nothing there for him. 
---
However, occasionally you‚Äôll see vertibirds in the sky, escorting a cargobot. If that cargobot manages to be shot down, EVERYBODY can go and loot it.
---
You didn‚Äôt just misspeak. *You insulted someone for reading what you wrote and commenting on it*. The fact that you added corrections later in the discussion doesn‚Äôt change the fact that **you never made the same correction to your original post**. 
---
So being a jerk to someone because they didn‚Äôt ‚Äòknow what you meant‚Äô and based their reply on exactly what you said is very poor manners.  
---
It‚Äôs not that you just misspoke; you didn‚Äôt also have to be rude about it to other people. 
---
That‚Äôs the issue. Spelling or grammatical mistakes aren‚Äôt a big deal. Lashing out because someone legitimately misunderstood you?  That‚Äôs exceptionally immature.
---
For sure.  I think we have 9 more days
---
Depending on how those fonts are rendered that could be the first signs of a heat issue in your PS4, too.  Have you blown the dust out recently?
---
You and your fellow clansmen huh. This subreddit had some of the cringiest posts I've ever seen on a day to day basis.
---
I had this happen a while back, he chased me into a room that had a locking door, which I closed on my way out locking him in.  I immediately logged off really enjoying the fact that he likely fell down the cliff my camp hangs over.
---
She become mad for the headache
---
Meg is not the source of daily reputation quests.
---
Rocky or Wren are the source of the daily repeatable quests to gain reputation.
---
For Raiders, there is also the mirelurk turn-in at the "Ohio River Advaentures"
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wastelanders\_reputations](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wastelanders_reputations)
---
Thank you very much for the information. It‚Äôs not too bad if it‚Äôs 100 (and stays that way). Still half a days redemption of gold bullion but better than a full days.
---
It's strange because I walked to the crater from my Camp and After She run away
---
don't be bloodied or have more health. once you see a few people have died back off. run away and give them a chance to respawn. This is a simple game mechanic to actually make you pay attention and make your death or their death have consequences.
---
Ohhh okay, I thought I had to get quests from Meg because of the Vault 79 questline.
---
Sometimes I have sympathy for someone in this situation, even though the game clearly warns players about Workshop PvP. 
---
This time?  I hope OP is never able to keep a workshop for more than 30 seconds in the future.
---
Thank you!! That makes so much more sense, thanks for taking the time to reply!
---
I like in Diablo 3 the gold beam the bursts up when there‚Äôs legendary loot.
---
Having some ultra rare outfit drops would also give people more incentive to engage.
---
That's perfect thank you! I did the cargo event thing at Morgan Town Airport and wasn't sure if we all got copies. Thanks!
---
I put in a ticket specifically stating that I purchased a year of FO1st on March 21.  I then had to restate the ssme exact thing.  O then had to provide xbox email and I added gamertag.  The response was they refunded the atoms. I had to write back because I didn't understand that.  I was not looking for a refund.  I am looking to be provided with the monthly atoms which is part of the fully paid subscription.  I recently switched the renewal off, and it clearly stated that the subscription ends March 21, 2021.
---
Sorry that‚Äôs what I meant
---
What outfit is that? Looks really cool.
---
That‚Äôs a good one
---
*You mean... actually use some simple and basic tactics and plan ahead for this the game mechanics work?*
---
***But then, I won‚Äôt be able to do my Leeroy Jenkins impression!!***
---
I‚Äôve been wearing the tadpole skirt for the last 30 levels. Totally should have way more female options for clothing
---
Haha yah I was just quoting his reaction to when you return the equipment ‚Äúon the house‚Äù... or it‚Äôs the recent intel not sure which one lol
---
Yeah I've had the red dress and devil horns on for at least 30-40 levels and I'm getting tired of it, might just do my witch outfit for Halloween a little early this yr.
---
I was once able to stand and salute as a very coordinated team (of high and low levels) took my Pro-Gamer Hide &amp; Seek Wookie ass out. It was an amazing thing to watch. Teams working well in NW is a sight to behold!
---
They do not. It‚Äôs a waste of good flux. 
---
The bits of splodey-meat will work, though...
---
Because there is no endgame. Alright, sure. We now have the Colossal Problem, but that‚Äôs *one* new event and *one* NPC who, lets be honest, isn‚Äôt very well thought out.
---
That would have to be done elsewhere. Witch-hunting isn‚Äôt allowed on this sub. 
---
So, if you have an external link at some point, feel free to share it. üòâ
---
I would have love to have seen that! Instant karma
---
There were quite a lot of dresses in the early days of the Atomic Shop. I'm not sure how often, if ever, they resurface.
---
Yeah
---
How many do you need to do damage? I threw a few at someone‚Äôs camp who was messing with me once and it didn‚Äôt seem to do any damage
---
I usually hang out under the part where we initially drop in at. If Earle happens to get me with fear attack, my character just runs face first into the wall behind.
---
I'd be happy if some of the unisex stuff fit the female form better. Like I can sew outfits from scratch but can't take in a pair of pants so I don't have drop-crotch? Ok.
---
IIRC, it‚Äôs in the game files but not accessible in the game itself. Same for Buffout. 
---
Not sure why, since Mentats are craftable, as well as most of its derivatives
---
Thats not a reason to steal other players stuff
---
Have you considered getting good? Apparently that fixes this particular issue.
---
You may being trying to copy files to a folder requiring admin rights.
---
It is the dead center of the map. That's a default location for invalid locations.
---
"You'll get them...when you get them!" Todd and Pete.
---
I know, and I refrain from making trap camps. As fun as it sounds. Instead I kill people more than twice my level in workshops.
---
Wait so two different scientists made the cryolater? Or did vault 111's overseer steal the design?
---
See that is all new to me I'm going to go out and make a hundred okay just for such an emergency
---
Yeah, but as a heavy gunner I'm concentrating on earl, just how it plays out. Its a bit like adding insult to injury, by completing the objective I'm out more than people killing the spawns, who get some of their ammo back. Not that I mind them getting their ammo back, more power to them. But it seems a bit backwards.
---
And I do like a good vengeful hunt üòè
---
Wasn't 63 supposed to have a flatwoods monster in it?
---
Also could we have an event around it in flatwoods instead?
---
That player very likely found a container full of them discarded by someone who duped/received duped presents. They thought they won the lottery but actually those plans sit unpurchased in their vendors for months. They probably either:  
---
\- have no clue that they are absolutely worthless  
---
\- use them to boost the #plans on their camp hover-over to bait more customers
---
What‚Äôs canon mean?
---
Yes, but it would he hard to put in the right place again
---
It seems to take quite a while, and I think having Demo Expert equipped  helps. 
---
I watched someone do it to a base where I was shopping. I had to repair the vending machine to try to complete my purchase, lol.
---
Everything is running fine on every other game, and Fallout itself after that session, yeah I've been cleaning the dust out.
---
Heck I've not even been getting lag during events like other people claim is happening.
---
it's been over a few months since they revealed a colossal problem and the fact that the place was gonna get nuked. 
---
if you're in a team log off when the nuke is launched and then join back 3 minutes later when it's launched. I think your camp is fine if it is spawned into a nuke zone
---
Yeah, it really messes with radiation values
---
I always suspected that that was planned and when it was revealed to have been planned i was still a bit sad cos it is awesome.
---
Read this in his voice without thinking twice.
---
+karma
---
Stay strong soldier, you haven‚Äôt bought any levels yet so why give up merely one away!
---
It may not be easier for noob players to get scrip. 
---
Also whatttt lmao you think all these B/25/25 fixers and handmades actually legitimately drop that often? RNGJesus doesn't love us that much.
---
I get that I just feel it be useful to new player either that or at some point new players with stop joining. There is a lot of new players at moment as it on gamepass.
---
heads is the rarest camp plan yes. only thing rarer is the mining helm
---
The respawn bug has been an issue for awhile now.
---
I hope you are being sarcastic. Duping is in the core of the market, and there are injection points all over the trading networks.
---
I just thinking off new player who will have it happen to them and then miss out because they will stop playing the game.
---
The first one? That's the Leather Coat :)
---
And Thanks :)
---
I have like 1.5 ranks left to do myself, and about 7 or 8 more on my boyfriend's account. Stay strong! We can make it through til the end without buying our way up.
---
I‚Äôve never seen this one yet
---
Will the current legendary season end before the Purveyor sale starts? I have 1000 script and unclamped script on the game board.
---
You‚Äôre welcome have a good day.
---
True you should also have a hazmat suit or stealth suit hotkeyed for these instances when youre forgetful.
---
I think it's all based off of experience, maybe the new people are having fun. It's a f**ing game for christ sakes, as long as their having fun that's all that matters. (I wasnt trying to make that sound like I'm being harsh lol)
---
Maybe they want to level up? Maybe its a second character? If it's that big of an issue, don't stand near them then.  It's a game, people are supposed to have fun just the whole point.
---
No. Colossal Problem Stein was the Doctor. You‚Äôre thinking of Colossal Problem‚Äôs monster.
---
Ok.  Thank you.  I'll give it a shot.  The way it's set up might make that easier for me.
---
Yep. Its why my friend and I used say play some covid76. Helped out a lot of people get into streaming too
---
You mean the original video?  I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs staged or not, but it‚Äôs hilarious either way.
---
Every single challenge i had today auto completed
---
People were selling cheap flux just so people would buy then they‚Äôd put the stacked boards under them to insta kill and get there flux back + the caps . 2020 brought out the crazy in people !
---
I was about to cave in because of the level up challenge. I have 2 level 200+ and 3 mules that can't move.
---
but then line in the sand showed up. only 1575 score to go, tomorrow's the day.
---
You probably won't be able to blueprint the whole thing, I recommend chunks that couldn't be put together any other way.
---
I did mostly exploring for the first year of the game. Even with 1300 hours in, I‚Äôm like level 256. I keep waiting for mods.
---
it is. They came out and admitted it a few years ago. They released a video showing them practicing it. 
---
still love it though.
---
Hello. Jist want to chime in. 
---
Firstly, imo, the only wrong way to play the game is when you arent having fun.  And there are a few suggestions i have that i found fun. 
---
The most fun ive had playing this game is playing with friends. Im not sure of your preferred gamestyle, solo or group play. My most memorable experience is hosting in game events with said friends. Be creative and have fun with made up events.  I can recommend our PeaceKeepers Of Appalachia group to join. 
---
Secondly, without having to move around special points to optimize you perks and build, i suggest in investing in points to your preferred weapon to do more damage.  
---
Ive played all the kind of playstyles and think switching things up by changing the weapon i use brought about more fun for me. Having at high points in strength allows u to invest in damage perk of which ever weapon  from that category. U feel like running melee, shotgun, heavy guns? All that is possible. Play one type until u get enough points to rank up damage perks of another type. Once u get enough levels and are able to switch perks for different weapons based on your mood for that gaming session. 
---
Lastly, power armor is nice. Helps defense and stay alive. Getting max level power helps and modding them to suit your style adds more fun. Not everything needs to be emergency protocol or jet pack or calibrated shocks. Try other mods to find more fun.
---
I can help with all of that. Weapons, armor, power armor crafting and modding. Lemme know if u want to get help from me.
---
kinda wish I hadn't slacked off at the beginning. definitely skipping next season.
---
Paige is the ‚Äúleader‚Äù of foundation. And meg is the ‚Äúleader‚Äù of crater. 
---
If you take all the gold. From either one of them. One of them will always be mad/disappointed in you. However they will mention that they still have use for you. Basically what they mean is ‚Äúyou screwed us over, but you‚Äôre not going to become an enemy for us. But just know I don‚Äôt like you. 
---
I screwed over the raiders and split the gold with foundation. Meg still talks to me and mentions it from time to time that she can‚Äôt believe I screwed her over. But she‚Äôs not too upset because obviously raiders. And that she is too busy and has important things in mind to worry about me. 
---
You can still do daily quests for each faction. And you can rank up and get max reputation with both of them. Meaning you CAN unlock all
---
Rewards for both sides. Just assuming you eventually reach max reputation. And you have enough gold to buy the plans
---
Dont go there? People can do what they damn please with their own camp, your fault for falling for it.
---
I think the best approach would be to teach them what to look out for. A lack of any nearby Stash or Scrap box. The vending machines are close to a cliff *(Hell, if the base is close to a cliff, be wary!)*. If they are suspicious at all, don their Power Armor, equip Light Step, etc. 
---
I tend to jump on top of the vending machines if possible to thwart any punji plans. And I always stash my junk before visiting camps.
---
These type of events should also always have Tinkerers workbench for ammo crafting too and a stash box. Agree?
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox, I‚Äôll take you up on that one.
---
I‚Äôve tried blueprinting the most simple of camps and have never been able to place them on any plot of land.  I just wanted to give you a heads up so you‚Äôre prepared to lose your camp.
---
I have to carry around my junk a lot because of stash space
---
How is it my fault for wnating ammo and not suspecting people you are pne them arent you
---
I just went to 6 servers with hardly and little people dots, none to 2 groups, no nuked zones and after that it put me back in the first one I was in that I couldn‚Äôt put my camp in originally. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I usually drop it down 5 or 10mph then gun it when they try to pass me, then drop it down again.   I got all day for these assholes
---
For the score points. Buy 3 things from a vendor. If there's nothing else interesting then I'll by 3 rounds, 1 at a time.
---
If they have .308 or 5.56 then I'll just buy it all in 3 stages, for same reason.
---
It also used to be a way if saying, "thanks, nice set up, but nothing for me".
---
You got this Gorgnak!!
---
Not if you can‚Äôt win without it because the other guy just totally tanks everything else you throw at him. That‚Äôs what my BE laser is for. Killing asshats and people who I‚Äôve decided have displeased me, example Tesla users and people in a workshop I want to use.
---
This, and they shouldn‚Äôt lose their glow when they‚Äôre alive
---
To complete the daily buy or sell 3 items.
---
Just trying to complete the daily quests, one of them is "buy 3 things from a players vendor"
---
What helm and outfit is that?
---
It just looks a bit like it did a couple months before wastelanders. ü¶ó
---
It's for the daily score challenge
---
lol nuking a camp is a waste of a keycard.
---
There is this challenge in the legendary run to buy/sell  3 items from other players
---
Yer I get what you saying. I have not come across one my self, but usually I only buy to get the daily and if I'm really short on ammo. Other than that I just made and scavage for it.
---
You miss a few hundred caps and some other misc loot if you do that
---
Explains the bugs, Vault-Tec is notorious in its neglectance.
---
It doesn‚Äôt let me move any direction except straight forward, that drills already gotten me twice
---
Oh okay that makes sense thanks! Got back into playing the game like 3 days ago and i thought i was doing something wrong lol
---
Unstoppables 5 magazine, Nuka Cola Quantum, Stealth Boy MkIII, full set of serums, and BE laser activated!
---
BRB working on my swastika ;)
---
I get the power armor, but how does photomode glitch?
---
Absolutely loved this photo.
---
Yup, she does exactly what you mentioned. I'll do the daily quests now, thanks for the clarification!
---
Ok.  Thank you.  
---
I had a camp nuked once(idk why) and it wasn't that expensive to fix.  I'm tempted to just let it get nuked.  
---
But every half hour might be too much of a burden.
---
Man line in the sand is the best for leveling. My level 370 can get a full level even without any xp buffs (other than inspirational of course)
---
Unstoppables 5 magazine is *amazing* against energy weapons. Combine that with Dodgy and Serendipity and you‚Äôre on a roll.
---
You‚Äôre welcome. Have a good day.
---
You too!
---
I don't think it should. Simple reason is, it would make the SBQ obsolete, and I don't think that should even be an option.
---
I wasn't paying attention.  
---
Does that work with public teams?  I think it usually warns me that I'm exiting my team when I exit to the main menu.
---
 Getting sidetracked in fallout games is the best thing to do. don't look online for builds or exp builds you will ruin the fun behind figuring it out yourself
---
i'm lvl 150 and i have everything in the game that's "the best" and i wish i'd never look up any of that info or look at vids online. it ruins the fun.
---
You have nothing worth buying in your vendor and they want to complete a daily.
---
Id like to make myself believe the wasteland nuke turns the world slowly
---
Hopefully it will be our reward in future content for wiping out the BOS  when they arrive.
---
Items on the ground is really bad in areas with Prime Cuts events.
---
Just think how crazy Line in the Sand would get.
---
It‚Äôs 850 a night and comes with a kitchenette, jacuzzi, and complimentary mini bar
---
I‚Äôd been saving my stuff cause I was tired of shitty roles and idk how good this is but I just got a furious explosive 250 reload res. Gatling gun which I thought was cool
---
The BOS was wiped out before we came out of the vault? Or am I mistaken?
---
Reported him there now and added a link to the video here. 
---
Thanks for link bro
---
A person of culture who has seen The Onion.
---
I kept wondering about this. I always wear PA and never could change course.
---
Lmfao
---
I never saw the level 600 in Excavator power armor as a pi√±ata before. He gets the chance to shoot or run. If he runs, I keep the workshop. If he shoots, I‚Äôm coming for his ass, and harvesting that sweet sweet junk. What‚Äôs your best loot and from what kind of player?
---
I'm talking about when they return to Appalachia in the upcoming update.
---
Damage mostly
---
Ok well cool and thanks for the pointers
---
Having the same issue now.
---
Laughs in tenderizer
---
Happened once to each of my characters. I think during the last min of battle I'm just going to hide in a corner. There is no incentive to risk my rewards. If your melee earl can 1 shot you, or vats good luck healing in time when the roof opens up over your head. I think the worst part of that stupid respawn mechanic is that it puts your outside of the event and you lose the rewards for event completion as well as missing earls loot.
---
With Blackjack and hookers?
---
MODUS keeps saying it's under construction. I've done many Enclave missions so I don't think those are the key to unlocking it.
---
I might start selling them; usually only 5-10 at any time. Doesn't take long to collect 1 
---
What is a good going rate?
---
Serum price, 200-300?
---
Did you record it low definition?
---
So I assume you already have max heavy gunner, as well as expert and master.  Beyond that bloody mess is good.  What's the legendary prefix on your gun?
---
Bloody, 10% more damage while aiming
---
That buzzing sound also helps greatly to pin point the location of the pile
---
You‚Äôll get 500 Atoms for completing,, but I would not buy the last one.  
---
Theres enough Daily challenges left you will make it w/o a problem.
---
Given the discussions on earning score for no purpose (after reaching 100) and not getting atoms for dailys after reaching 100, might be a while before you can earn more atoms for whatever appears in the  atoms shop between now and the next season.
---
If they add centaurs, the mutant are gonna have a damn army of them, muts, and floaters.
---
Usually 300-500max, 300 should see them go pretty quickly if I find them XD
---
Oh fuck, the wendigo teeth have acid? Dammit, i need that and i thought wendigo teeth were just bone üò´
---
That sucks.    Fortunately, and I have I have no idea why, it‚Äôs never happened to me and I‚Äôm at score level 99.
---
They probably will. I bet in due time they'll add a "Pitt" DLC that features centaurs.
---
Not that I need this in my life but, it would be pretty cool
---
For bloodied nerd rage is good.  Also the mutation adrenal reaction.  The perk strange in numbers boosts adrenal reactions damage.  Stabilized is great, class freak helps negate the downsides of your mutations.  The drink high voltage hefe gives more damage as well.
---
Awesome.
---
Its the presidential suite, was tied into a map wide event for voting, and it is currently cut content as far as we know.
---
For some odd reason, it makes you go the opposite direction you are facing. So if you face Earl, you‚Äôre getting a face full of sac.
---
I was focusing on the last part, sorry
---
They do im pretty sure it 2 acid per windigo tooth
---
Yes or you can buy one from someone
---
I agree. Once you get all the exclusive plans, it stops losing its incentive to do it over Scorched Earth.
---
I know not everybody has the Chinese stealth armor, but you can obviously favorite the hazmat suit. If I ever join a new world and spawn in a nuke zone, sure I could click the option to find a new world, but I just click on stay, and quickly equip my Chinese/hazmat suit.
---
I liked Caits grognak from FO4; put that on my char as soon as I found it in the atom shop.  Graduated to the (queen) grognak when that bundle came out.
---
Too bad the nuka girl suit has the big ring for the helmet attachment.  Someone on PC posted a link for a mod that makes the NG outfit Look more like a cat woman suit....  
---
Month or so ago in a similar thread, someone said there was a blue (or grey) sequined dress, but I‚Äòve never seen it.
---
The 76 Legendary Crafting System is Autistic Depressing Cancer...
---
Damn, good point. 
---
I guess best solution is just find a combination that looks good. Or maybe ask them to alter certain backpacks to better fit with the jetpack, or the opposite.
---
it's for fallout 1st members. you can go there and a robot version of todd howard gives you foot massages
---
No shit... Jet boots would be badass
---
I tried asking that and she delivered twisted bliss to me.I asked her to marry me after that.
---
Haha, very funny
---
blueprint just the top portion, not the foundations. then build the foundations how they were and the blueprint will snap to them.
---
Do you have a nukadragon build you could shoot me?
---
Dammit, thank you! My main source of lead is doing breach and clear, lode bearing, and maps to deposits.
---
Acid is in such short supply üòë
---
Uhh. Gauss shotgun??
---
yeah, i'm a rifle build but because of some god tier heavy guns i began using bear arms, now i carry more heavy guns than rifles. Real weird.
---
When you first load into a server it hides the jetpack quite often, switching your chest will make it reappear.
---
I like your dedication.
---
the only time i've been able to join with team is when my game has crashed and i've closed and reopened. 
---
You could just quickly message someone on your team and then leave. And then join from that.
---
For.lead just hit lucky hole mine with the excavator pa you can walk out of there with a ton of lead ore. Cloth is now the only component that I'm constantly looking out for.
---
What did you do and what did they have
---
Okay, that I can understand. 
---
But if I can't hide the jetpack, at least give me different options to better match the different backpacks. Or yeah, just hiding the backpacks, but as someone else pointed out that would hurt atom shop sales so it will probably never happen.
---
No, it would make your weapon break 50% slower...
---
it got nerfed a really long time ago, I believe it used to hold 80.
---
OMG THERES A PERK FOR MINING. FUCK IM STUPID.... whats its name please good sir
---
I thought trolls lived under bridges
---
Thanks.  Messaging sucks on PS4.  I doubt most people even check them.   
---
I wish PS5 controllers would come with some kind voice to text ability.   Or something.
---
Not only legendary loot, but some of normal mob with high loot like cryptid and sentry bot need this.
---
A legendary sentry bot, killed, and his corpse just take off earth if you don't loot legendary and run.
---
I'm not sure, but I really would like a clear answer too about it. I will have to take a look anyway. But I think some players created new characters specificly to use debuffing and buffing Nuclear winter perk cards. I'm normaly pretty successful in Nuclear Winter, I have a really good auto rifle build. 
---
But since i'm back, unless i keep falling upon players who just poped an Overdrive (drug), I have no idea how they freaking melt me so fast. From my experience there's only overdrive that can allow you to practicly oneshot players ( if you already have an optimised build ).
---
Does it though?  Someone dropped a nuke once on the area including my camp and someone else's.  I still have no idea if they were even targeting me, let alone what I may have done to warrant it if they were.
---
Consumables seem to have gotten issues since U21, Toxic Goo no longer gives rads either. :-|
---
I make sure the nuke is dead center on their camp, so they can tell with certainty I‚Äôm targeting them. They haven‚Äôt sold a nuclear keycard since.
---
Weapon artisan maxed repairs it to 200%. Gunsmith 1-5 reduces its degradation 10%-50%
---
haha.. ikr.... he said his high intelligence and his farming route helps in leveling up quickly.
---
LOL.  What is that outfit called?
---
It's not healing rads, it's giving temp health.
---
Its not a perk you need to do the quest at the mining hq to get the plans for the excavator power armor. If you have a full set you get like twice the ore you normally would.
---
Yea I was hoping 50% slower with the lucky shot wrk or whatever it's called that repairs it would be enough to keep it repaired.
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
I know what you mean. 4 out of 5 of my characters have camps under direct threat  from Earle nukes.üòî
---
700lb of junk.  That‚Äôs believable
---
This is good - thank you
---
I've never seen the blue or grey dress either!
---
I got the nukasuit and was so disappointed about that ugly ring- you HAVE to wear the helmet with it or else it looks awful but the helmet looks awful too ah it sucks lol
---
Fully rank up ammosmith, get super duper and avoid automatic weapons unless your fighting something big or a lot stronger than you. Lastly you don't need to join every SBQ or ACP
---
Yeah... that‚Äôs why I decided to just use a stinger mag instead. 5 bullets less than drum, but more damage.
---
I assumed it was a glitch. Damn that‚Äôs a shame. At least 50 as you say. Craaaaazy.
---
I believe there was a PVP event planned for the game where you'd need to be elected president (much the same as you worked your way through the military ranks) and to do this you'd have to travel around the map doing something with all those voting stations? I think you'd also earn tokens for playing it that you could trade in using a terminal for special cosmetic gear. It was probably intended to be added post launch but whatever plans they had likely changed and PVP proved to be less of a focus overall. You can still glitch your way in there, it's neat though there's nothing to really do.
---
Oh I thought it just gave extra endurance, makes sense.
---
But why can't rads take me back down?
---
Oh, ok. Thanks, i didnt know. Wait, hornwright? I went there and did all of everything and nothung ever triggered. Im sorry for asking so many questions
---
Keycards are easy to come across and the loot I get from inside the whole 5-10 minute run is worth it... I have like 40 more keycards stored away
---
or quickly grab ya phone. take a pic of your teammates and then leave. and then i assume you have a similar system to xbone where you can find a player and view their profile.
---
This is it.  There's youtube vids on it out there.  Cut pvp content.
---
Been doing Dailys for score, events for T-notes.  
---
Rolling for ideal SS armor.  
---
Still seeking a specific weapon for my build.   
---
Completed the legendary run earlier today, so a bit more flexibility in the routine.   Today has been a few tweaks in camp - difficult because I‚Äôm at max budget.
---
Trying to figure out where all my non-essential weight is so I can lose it and start fast travelling again.....walking everywhere is starting to get old.
---
I thinknots the grahm mining hq. It's like South East corner of ash heap I think. Sryni can't give you an exact location at work right now.
---
It also isn't every wallpaper. All of my slate/stone wallpapers show it just fine. It's a little ridiculous considering the image showing the gameboard is on the space wallpaper, which does NOT work
---
Ohhhh, ik where that is! Thank you!
---
For quite a while.  Doing sbq a lot gives you enough repair kits to never worry about repairing anything.
---
I know I would love this because The current system is terrible.I would think most people play when they have the time and that means they play at many different times throughout the week.They just need to pick a static time and stick with it.Never going to please everyone with whatever time is chosen anyway.Just base it off the time zone that has the largest player base and have the timer reset at the least populated portion of that day.
---
Yeah i just press the trigger again and it usually stops.
---
Sorry for my bad english
---
Does the sale apply to legendary modules??
---
2020 made me realize that people online are mostly judging and toxic not gonna say 76 is a conduit but I will say that I‚Äôve seen my way around much a game community of diverse population and 76 is tied 2nd with sot with gta5 online in 1st it‚Äôs good that they stepped up for us in trying times but after the nonsense I‚Äôve been dealing with especially during the rep pre 21 to present day I‚Äôm losing hope for people that we share a planet on and online services with. Still would like to see that 9mm Springfield 1911 pistol and that m1 garand Jeff Gardner .-. Plz man but other then that one thing it‚Äôs a ok game
---
Yeah, help the man, cuz I need it too.
---
and fudge !
---
i would also accept coke and floozies
---
U should nuke their base for
---
the drop rates at campfire tales are terrible. i got 1 in like 40. so in short. No. 
---
I suppose you could make it easier by just buying the mods you want. I bought a high capacity mod for 15k recently.
---
Huh?
---
Why don't you go begging for caps instead?
---
The only source for that recipe is the bunker after all...
---
I have both perks maxed out and honestly I think one of them is broken. I have to fix my weapons constantly after this newest update.
---
800 caps is a good deal. Farm purified water for easy caps.
---
We could be the A team üòèüòÇ
---
Oh, shame :(
---
If you‚Äôre looking for the mutation, those goes for 2-300 caps usually. 
---
The recipe is a different story.
---
Batteries included
---
why the fuck are you getting downvoted? People are cringe here, the man is just trying to help
---
Why do I feel like you just got whooshed?
---
Not when other players are selling them for 800- 3000 caps
---
Quite a bit. Vault raids came and went. The items are available again though. There's two main factions, Raider and Foundation. The Raiders are more militant scavengers, the Foundation are just kind of there. The more traditional raiders are the Blood Eagles, just there to kill or be killed. Both Raiders and Foundation have rep bars to grind through and item plans you can buy at different levels. There is a new currency, gold bullion. There is the legendary run, youre coming back at the tail end of the first one, but there is another coming. Basically you have daily and weekly objectives to gain points to earn cosmetic items or minor game effect items. There is a new instanced event where you fight a huge wendigo. There is currently a scrap turn in thing for the Brotherhood of Steel, who should be returning coming up. There is a new standard and power armor. The standard armor you craft with random legendaries and you can buy a jet pack for. The Chinese Stealty Suit is back. There is a slew of new gauss weapons you have to buy the plans for. Pvp is basically dead, replaced by a battle royal mode. There is a ton of stuff, the game has a lot going on right now. Oh, and there is a bunch of bugs, some you are probably used to. One of the ones you hear about the most is magic weapons, which are normal legendary weapons which trigger a damage cascade that can kill the SBQ in ten or twenty seconds.
---
People can't stop you from pvp and you can't stop them from doing what they want. Stop trying to order people, you don't own this sub.
---
Do you know how hard it is to make a drum mag professionally?  Much less by hand.  I wish they had Calico rifles in the game
---
They both left after they killed me
---
Batteries included. If you are not swimming in fusion cores, something is wrong
---
I use pack rat, so I legit tend to carry quite a ton of junk
---
Feels like it, but somehow managed to get it on the first drop.
---
Haven‚Äôt gotten it again since.
---
Well, unless he requires something from the mine he won't care much. (he needs his one millionish coal scrap that he will not need)
---
I used to have the quest trigger each time I picked up some technical data, but for some time now it won't trigger as it should.
---
The reality is that there's no defense against pvp.  Player weapons do way too much damage to other players and we have way to little health.  Turn on pacifist and stay out of workshops
---
Put the function on recon scopes and give players a reason to use the ugly things.
---
Because it‚Äôs a bug right now. Supposed to be fixed in Patch 22
---
Np any time
---
How?
---
I have 2, and I've been strictly playing with my other character since the event.  
---
I'm hoping that in a few weeks people start nuking the SBQ again.  Otherwise it's futile to stay there.
---
That's certainly one opinion
---
The only way to get the recipe is to spend 23000-24000 caps at the enclave bunker in the genetics lab. If people have the serum recipe in their vendors for that little, just buy it. If it's the actual serum, don't spend more than 400$ at a camp vendor for it.
---
That's a good idea.   Thank you.
---
You can also get them too drop from operation tidy.
---
I wish that now that they have npcs they'd just make it a solo thing with you vs a random npc.  Maybe an enclave fanboy who doesn't really have what it takes to be a member.
---
I belive that perk only repairs it to 100% and not 200% like artisan, so you would probably find that if you are lucky, you'd get 1 repair out of it before it breaks entirely. I think they need to up the durability of weapons in this game for the upcoming damage nerf and enemies being leveled up
---
O
---
No I don‚Äôt need the recipe I‚Äôm just looking for the serum it self
---
T-60 PA BOS roleplayer having a meltdown calling everyone douchebags over the mic during meatweek for killing mobs because he was too lazy to leave the top of the metal structure.
---
Followed him to workshop and Nuka naded him in his blueprint.
---
25 Stable Flux, about 100 pounds of screws, lead, ballistic fiber, and another 400 in junk junk. He was inches away from a scrap box.
---
I've done it 21 times and I've still not gotten the plans yet....
---
None have so far.
---
It will not stay like this. If you farming them from nuclear central, you expose yourself to pvp. It may affect you eventually. And when you have to craft primed fusion core, it will go down relatively fast.
---
And the most important, Power user is doubling the amount of shots a Laser Gatling can do.
---
Damn :(
---
nobody is selling the recipe for 800 caps. the cheapest i've ever seen a recipe go for is 6k. 
---
I sell the serums for 250 caps. if you want the marsupial **serum** i can give you one for free.
---
Gotta expect the Owner to trap you, its the Wasteland after all.
---
And if you dont find a group invite from a lvl 375 suspicious, i cant help you.
---
Yes! More dresses please! Ive been wearing the witch and civil war dress a lot for lack of better options.
---
What perks and weapon are you using
---
by boosting charisma and some drugs i could get it down to 17k. I imagine you could get it down even more.
---
I‚Äôd appreciate that. You don‚Äôt have to do it for free. 250 is reasonable. I‚Äôve just been looking to get a cheaper one than 800 caps or higher you know? So yes I will take one if you have one to give.
---
Hold the reload button (X on Xbox) it‚Äôll put ur gun away and then fire your weapon to take it back out and it‚Äôll be fixed
---
B2525 fixer tyr has a video on the same build I have
---
PC - I appreciate the challenge :)
---
Also get them from stings and things
---
I‚Äôve seen it happen in Nuclear Winter too, weird AF.
---
Is there a way to recreate this with heavy weapons
---
Just the weapons and armour plans that require gold bullion can be crafted legendary. Every thing else is found at the Rusty pick for scrip or on dead legendary enemies.
---
Hit up Rammadeus. I buy all my serums from him for 250c
---
If you‚Äôre worried about finding the spot, you could always drop something insubstantial and then look for the loot bag. Wouldn‚Äôt work somewhere with a lot of PCs of course but would work other times
---
Ah, thats what I was afraid of. Thank you!
---
No you cannot.
---
Only the wastelanders weapons/armor and vault raid armors can be crafted legendary at this time.
---
For other weapons like gatling guns and the like, you gotta farm legendaries and purveyor like everything else.
---
Yes, definitely! Throw on cap collector.
---
Sending PM
---
Use a camera it‚Äôll pop up legendary __________ so it‚Äôs easier to find in the body pile
---
Maybe with a magic weapon but with other no the sneak is putting a drastic change in damage
---
I added you on Xbox
---
It's okay. you probably need the caps more than me. I have no problem making dolla dolla bills! 
---
GT: rammadeus. 
---
invite please.
---
Np :) deff check out that build on tyr channel his build is great !
---
Next month. Hopefully.
---
Any radbeavers will work, they don‚Äôt have to be in that area
---
For real? Bruh the way they made it sound made me think it was gonna be the first month or two
---
It should drop the unused third level repair kit.
---
You must be new here. This was one of the biggest rants when it was nerfed from holding 80 rounds.
---
I'm hoping the nuke locations will normalize. It makes sense to nuke very close to Sunnytop station for all the yellowcake. If not I'll have to move which I really don't want to do. I love being able to leap down onto Bravo
---
There is also that purple sequin dress from the Atom shop. But I have not seen it on there in awhile.
---
Yeah. They are trying to tweak the amount it costs for the perks. It‚Äôs in a really good spot rn is fingers crossed it dosent get delayed again. ü§ûüèª
---
Yes! we need more cute dresses for sure. I personally like the tattered dress, and the green asylum dress combined with a prospector's hat, it's the only asylum i have that actually looks decent and the colour is cute, and it gives a "casual" look to it. But outside of that, there isn't really much, the witch costume looks good too. I would love to see something like the ratty skirt without the jacket, or red dress variants, a better swimsuit and even other civil war era dresses.
---
Dats tuff
---
Even fast traveling out it takes you to just outside the mine. Still maybe had I done it to the mine itself it would have still counted. I did pick whatever random faraway place those first two times.
---
*bethesda looks at you, fallout first ad in hand*
---
I'd be okay with the point cost as of now. Though I wish they'd give us some extra points for all the lost perk cards due to duplicates. Or just make it simple and be by level haha
---
Escalators would be nice.   And probably less buggy.
---
You might want to look at the actual perks before getting too excited lol.
---
Everyone wants cross save till the PC players show up.
---
I did and they are alright. It‚Äôs something new to the leveling system and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm happy about
---
Some people need to inflict pain, harm, suffering, stress to give them a sense of superiority, or they are so bored and lazy they can't be bothered to find a new game or activity that they need to play with you like a cat with a mouse.
---
In both cases, you have only lost a bit of junk. I usually respawn and go back to hang out, it seems to piss them off for some reason?
---
Legendary Modules won‚Äôt be on sale tho..
---
Do you know how hard it is to believe we can‚Äôt do that after being given the schematics *and* getting the specific perk for it?
---
Before September 22 if Bethesda wants to stay on course with their roadmap ([https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/6uGykyguCRz6hvvNUhZ5f0/61fd56348e4350f5ca4eb3106752fd13/F76\_2020\_Roadmap\_FULL-SIZE.png](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/6uGykyguCRz6hvvNUhZ5f0/61fd56348e4350f5ca4eb3106752fd13/F76_2020_Roadmap_FULL-SIZE.png)). I am going to assume Update 22 will occur on September 21, so there is still time for adjustments and letting Fortify Atlas play out.
---
Tag checks out üòÇ
---
Have you ever tried hand building any complicated machines item?  I mean, in game logic sure, but irl it's not easy to look at a drawing and just build something so precise as a drum magazine that just works.
---
My xbox broke so got a new one, by the time I got another and downloaded again I missed out on sheepsquatch n Croc that I really wanted :(
---
Just a heads up from someone who repairs PS4 consoles, if you have pets or live in a household where people smoke indoors ‚Äúblowing it out‚Äù isn‚Äôt going to be enough. You‚Äôre just blowing the dust and debris back into the console. Things like pet hair will clog the fins on the heat sink and restrict airflow and cigarette smoke will form a layer of sticky tar that dust will stick to and prevent proper cooling. It‚Äôs worth learning how to open the console and remove the power supply without damaging the system so you can clean it better if either situation applies to you. Tear down guides are available at ifixit.
---
This is also true for computers. I‚Äôve seen lots of computers that were running slow because of thermal throttling and all it needed was to be opened and cleaned out.
---
That‚Äôs why we need some gunsmith perks to build it.
---
I haven‚Äôt played it in a good bit but from what I remember I just looked at the minimap for where the bodies were
---
There is outfit literally called Piper's outfit or hat, she not even born yet lol
---
She runs with a shotgun and they weren‚Äôt expecting her to get into their face and BAM!!!   His friend just fast traveled out
---
That as well.  It's so nice to just glance at it and see where they are.
---
Vampire weapons is where it's at. Two people with vampires can tank Earle while others do their thing. I had him focused on me the entire time because my 1000+ rounds per Ultracite fusion core keeps the DPS going. No matter how much the stomped me or threw up on me, I just keep firing in his fugly face.
---
I mean, this same thing could be said about any game anyone liked during the pandemic. Or books, or movies, or taking long walks outside, or having good conversations online...
---
There's nothing about Fallout 76 in particular that makes this game heroic or a particularly good response to covid.
---
I also think the tasks you've listed-- and I call them tasks with great purpose-- are among the lamest things we could be doing with this game. I have no issues with people liking these things, I love things others would find tedious, but in no way has the SCORE grind or Fasnacht/Meat Week been any kind of substantial or even very rewarding offfering. They are intended to occupy players with busywork over long stretches void of development updates, nothing more.
---
So yea, cool to hear about people finding fun ways to occupy themselves during this ugly time. We all need distractions. But I don't think any of that is a reason to praise Fallout 76, which to me has been a sorely underdeveloped game this last year, and which continues to hand us uninspired, repetitive gameplay devices to keep us logging daily so they have a chance to push more MTX on us every Tuesday.
---
That's my opinion anyway.
---
Damn, so you just have to find them out in the world randomly?
---
This event is heavily glitched. The Colossus keeps disappearing into the ground or ceiling of the cave. When the Colossus doesn't disappear, the game always seems to crash. I've had this event glitch out more times than I've actually been able to complete it. I am so not exaggerating this. I hope Bethesda fixes this soon.
---
Again.... pre wastelanders there were still thousands playing at any given time. They only way you would see empty servers is if literally there were only 10 people playing. The way servers are filled makes it impossible to tell how many people are playing. Whether it‚Äôs 25 people or 250,000 people, you will experience the same number of people in your server. That‚Äôs the beauty of Amazon web services.
---
Patch 22 is scheduled for some time in september. Fractured Steel is in the Fall section of the roadmap. We don't have any dates more concrete than that.
---
Crocollosus Plushie 	~~200~~ 140 (30% Off!) 	August 31 to September 1 - from [here.](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5tjdMr2c4yv1LiPVrVLWOG/atomic-shop-weekly-update-august-25-september-1) 
---
So you can at least get that one. The rabbit is available today.
---
September 14th or September 21st.
---
People seem to be under the impression they‚Äôll just end The Legendary Run overnight and start the next one the very next day. I think we‚Äôll have a week or two between each season, which is where I get the above dates.
---
Use all shotgun perks and 2 grenade perks and bloodied mess. It makes the blast radius huge deal so much more damage. Grenades blast radius an damage is impossible to escape if it's near you.
---
Even as terrible as the online/multiplayer aspects of the coding are (no judgement of the programmers, it‚Äôs a pretty shit single player game engine there‚Äôs no reason to believe it would be a great multiplayer game engine) there‚Äôs no way they would implement a single static seed to determine any aspect of rng.
---
I think the Gauss shotgun has explosive damage so the demolition expert and the granadier cards might give it a boost, I might be wrong
---
You need to only hold 200 of each item in your stash unless its lead, acid, steel, cloth as you'll use a fair bit of each making ammo
---
Or have blips on your map like Red Dead does for corpses.
---
I'm going to hit 98 after todays so won't be able to get the two items I actually want üòÇüòÇ
---
I use screws just repairing my armor, since I don't have Fallout 1st and don't have the atoms to spend on repair kits all the time
---
Are you scrapping your junk? I‚Äôm sure people could help you figure out how to manage your stash better
---
Hmmm, I‚Äôd try dense. I only run that and routinely take my own explosive shots all the time with zero issue. Good luck!
---
This
---
This happened to me just now it should be a intended feature
---
‚ÄúVast, Pixel-like, and loathsome, it darted like a stupendous monster of nightmares to the pixel, about which it flung its gigantic scaly pixels, then while it bowed its hideous head and gave vent to certain measured pixels. I think I went mad then.‚Äù
---
Gonna try later today, tried so much things already
---
Or, pacifists players can't be killed by any form from an normal player, also let's normal player in free constant PVP without restriction and dmg limits, remove the workshop PVP status and everyone is happy, PVP players can fight each other without restriction and pacifists players are safe.
---
It always says "steal" when you open the container but you've only stolen it from someone if after you open it you get message saying the "player had become hostile". I've only had this happen once out of roughly ten.
---
On PC at least, any event becomes unplayable when someone pulls out a Tesla rifle. Those piles seem to lag the hell out of the game since the last patch.  line in the sand is worst because people want to hit every spawn for the XP, and Tesla shots hit multiple targets.
---
I wear pa, so...
---
Witcher does that as well.
---
But the sound of . 50 cal hunting rifle tho...i never silence mine just to enjoy it. Unsilenced lever sounds good too
---
fair play
---
Yes. This should be addressed. It‚Äôs a pain.
---
If you're looking for one shot damage, try a cursed harpoon with flechette mod in VATS... No build or perks required. Damage beats magic shotguns, although reload time sucks.
---
Daily Stings and Things. As you play, collect pieces as you kill bugs and store them. Once a day, head over to Dolly Sods, kill the Yao Guai, get rad roach from the locked closet, and turn it in. About a one in ten chance of getting a badge.
---
I usually grab the workshop while I‚Äôm there.
---
Yes.I have bulked everything aswell! I don't know what junks I should keep or not. I also have a lot of extra chems that I don't use.
---
No pets or smokers in this household thankfully. But my pc probably does need some care as it hasn't been liking the summer heat.
---
I didn't see it mentioned... Zorbos ship is the countdown timer.  It paces the event and should be at least 7 or 8 spaces away from the finish right now (moves 1 spot per day).
---
U can buy gold bullion with caps?
---
Try the patrol quest at the penitentiary. The reward is a random weapon plan, that‚Äôs where I got mine iirc.
---
Update, after almost 2 weeks I joined a game and made it past!!!
---
I got 4 of everything before getting a single meat pile plan. Meat pile and the heads are the rarest drops I get, the mining helmet and cursed weapons are my most common.
---
What am I supposed to be seeing here?
---
I heard some youtuber say that there will be atleast one week break between the the legendary run and the new battle pass
---
Some of them are great, what are you talking about?
---
Before I log off I find a new player or the lowest level on my team and drop everything extra I have that way I help them and start off my next session ready to roll
---
Early game its about standard weapon mods (hardened receiver, true barrel etc). Late game its about rolling for legendary versions of weapons and armour.
---
Got it second drop, meat pile third and plushie first, friends done it more than me and hasn‚Äôt got it at all
---
Is it due to pollution? If that's the case then it would stand to reason that it would clear up when the polluting had stopped.
---
Why dont you guys, no offense intended, put on the luck of the draw perk. Its pretty effective guys
---
Did you reinstall the game recently?
---
It clears all your Atom Shop settings in that process.
---
I agree.   Most people nuke to the north.
---
It's so dumb
---
No but I did install the PTS.
---
Update: I re-enabled everything and now the emotes work but my loot bag is still the default.
---
[Grass]

bAllowCreateGrass=0

in Fallout76Custom.ini
---
Pvp is a well-defined mechanic in this game. You willingly engaged in it at your own camp, and that's what happens if you do so.
---
If you think this was a bad experience, you didn't play this game at launch.
---
in another server, the silo is ooen but the player cannot drop tge nuke, therefore is personal.
---
Geez.
---
lol
---
Hover over a quest marker and select "show in Pip-Boy" i think.
---
Go to a quest marker on your map, then click on it, then you'll see a "show in pipboy" button which you can then choose to bring up your pip boy screen.
---

---
Fixed it! Tried a bunch of stuff but running an Ethernet cord was the only thing that worked!
---
I consider myself tanky but not min-maxed. Blocker 3, fireproof 2, dodgy 3, plus empath. In my PA I feel almost invincible as long as I avoid the falling embers. I can stand there shooting the Colossus while half a dozen spawns wail on me. I haven't died once since my very first event. No issue.
---
Situational awareness! Avoid the embers!
---
Oh shit, it seems fallout 76 servers are a small place
---
But also if a cargo bot is already unlocked then you are OK to take the stuff inside.
---
I was close, once.
---
The scene loaded slow for some reason(sun was shining?), the level 1 Blood Eagles got themselves got, then the settlers appeared, then they just screamed and dropped dead. Then the torture/execution apparatus appeared and exploded. I'm now 110% sure they can't be saved.
---
Some maybe, most aren't.
---
Sometimes you have to re-favorite them in the atom shop. Give that a try!
---
The enemie‚Äôs lvl shouldn‚Äôt be an issue with one wasteland
---
Chems are a good source of caps if you aren't using them
---
Must be nice to actually kill Earle, done it 2 times not even came close with like 6 other people. The event was so glitchy you couldn't even really move. At one point all of us where at the respawn point just looking around for a sec before going back to being smacked again üòÇ
---
But seriously what is the secret üôè
---
Use the light footed perk, under agility, and stay crouched down the entire time you're at someone's vendors.
---
No, it's a hypothesis. What is being presented is not a hypothesis, it's a claim of tested fact. Tested fact that is not verifiable is a belief.
---
HARD TO STARBOARD
---
Thank you for sharing your Survivor Story.
---
Ammo factory, the poison and fire resistance ones.  At the very least 20 more special points to allocate.
---
So, that glitch is back, huh?
---
Remove Aqua Boy/Girl perk card. That prevents the rads somehow.
---
Good to know, but honestly, not worth the workaround.
---
No. They are good. The ammo factory perk is great for all non melee builds, we finally have poison resistance for pa and non poison resist armour, we have fire resistance which helps at acp, plus all the extra special points. And then there‚Äôs master infiltrator. I could go on.
---
Out of curiosity, is that verified, or reasonable assumption? Not disagreeing either way, asking for future discussions on this matter, because you know it's going to happen.
---
Np, but yeah the stats from noct to uny were practically the same as well. So point taken
---
Please do.
---
They must‚Äôve changed it then, I used to spend evenings raining nukes for fun. It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve launched one.
---
I am having an issue with this one for sure. The legendaries are nice but using 3000 .50 cal is pretty tough.
---
And the dialog system and choices give me hope for the future of TES/Fallout. Some of them I would never say but theyre hilarious
---
I mean I did just build a fusion generator the other day. Only took a few desk fans and clipboards, works pretty good too. Now if I could just figure out how to fit more rounds into this gun.....
---
Where there's a picture of a pheasant on the map.
---
Seems that way. A month ago I jumped into a server. "Doing my dailies" and I bumped into a friend. I asked him if he joined me, and he asked the same thing. Nope.
---
We both accidentally joined the same server. Was super weird. Both of us thought the other was stalking.
---
Yeah, it's still terrible, but it's better.
---
I took there workshop and stole their shit
---
Yes! I‚Äôve been wearing the ratty skirt since level 65!
---
I really miss the sequined cocktail dress from FO4
---
Workshop stuff or did they pretty much carry their whole stash around
---
Yeah, like I said, video game logic.
---
Never even done this one I'll keep an eye out
---
I'm a reverse engineer and found the functions responsible for doing the random number generation. In the client it's based on client start time and on the server it's based on server start time. The most common seed to start with in a mersenne twister is the current time of application run
---
Yeah, I'm assuming it's that "trying to heal" that is the holdup. Having mostly played full health it's always that little bit of rad damage that is the issue usually.
---
I know the colossus that pops up near SBQ doesn't squat and yell if there's noone nearby.
---
So maybe if there's a way to keep a minimum distance from him, he'll stop screeching.
---
Absolutely.
---
Ah good, thanks for the info.
---
PREACH1
---
More than one sheep squatch at the same time
---
RNGeebus hates me, I've done 30+ turn-ins and no badge.
---
Others have gotten badges from there, but never for me.
---
I have gotten like 1 or 2 from the campfire tales.
---
Some people are completionists and want to spend hours unlocking all mods in the game. 9k screws? What madness possessed you to collect all those if they are not useful for you!
---
Then there's also the ballistic pouches and military duct tape, the two ammo cans, the desk fan, the duffle bag, the explosives crate, the med boxes (2) and the wood pile.
---
Yes, Eckserah personally located the pRNG functions in 76 as is the lead dataminer for 76 ;)
---
Oh yeah its always a show. I saw many variations of it over the times. Turrets fighting turrets. Turrets fighting Becketts. Turrets fighting the sheer existance of the camp that created them.
---
Often its caused by enemys that got spawned inside the house.
---
Sometimes my shotgun feels like a magic weapon. One-shot for 95% of enemies. 2 for SB, 4-5 for LSB. But against Earle its obviously not magical, lol. I'm sure now its not armor. My AA .50 machine gun ignores most if not all armor, combined with Stabalized, and Earle goes on kickin, so it must be like you mentioned damage multipliers that are out of control.
---
Hey FYI its kinda useless to bulk about 95% of things unless you plan on selling them to npcs. 
---
The only thing worth bulking to lessen weight is I think lead steel and maybe one more thing.
---
Otherwise you accidentally just use up plastic for almost no reason.
---
Cant afford to be a polatition
---
When it gets close to earl being just about dead, I always become super vigilant about where I'm standing and/or how many wendigos are around me.
---
*Todd Howard has entered the chat*
---
Stash problems you say?!  Boy have I got a deal for you!
---
Probably the legendary Sheepsquach at the end of the event.
---
I hope they bring back the white spring Halloween event this year, t'was fun.
---
Cries in Bethesda
---
Ahh. Yea that happens
---
Ah, I see. Thanks for the info. 
---
Were [fatal hotdogs](https://imgur.com/gallery/uQOvDqR) (and other +HP applications, like Grahm's Tato Salad) a thing before U21? I never noticed that happening before either, but now I'm not so sure.
---
They keep creating events and things to encourage teamwork but then don‚Äôt change stuff like this that can de-incentivize it. They need to change it so anyone actively contributing to an event/goal in a positive manner is rewarded with loot/drops. I think this would make it more likely that people would do pylons, collect ore, rez/heal people with friendly fire, or anything else an event/goal needs to succeed. No one should feel screwed out of rewards because they were positively contributing in another way. I don‚Äôt care if people get drops off mobs or legendaries I kill if they are doing something else to help out especially if I can‚Äôt do both at the same time. Hell, I welcome it. Also, a kitted out player one-shotting things should be a welcome help, not a source of frustration for other players. They work(ed) hard for their gear (in theory) so they should be able to use it and not get ire from other players for it.
---
No, unless they time gate earning atom based off the average it took for everyone who finished the run.
---
This is a collusal scandal!
---
It only counts 1 per click üò≠
---
You can tag the quest for it on any Garrahan billboard promoting their "New Model" Excavator.  There's one the outside corner right next to the Lucky Pick entrance and the Ice Machine at mumbles legendary shop.
---
I kind of like the idea of each boss dropping a different sort of kit. Earl could drop scrap kits while the queen drops repairs, to ensure they always have some value to keep farming each.
---
I think the fo76 wood challenges are set so each time you pick up a firewood pile, it counts as 1, even if the pile gave you 20
---
Cool idea!
---
The only logical thing about FO76 logic. 
---
On the 7th day Todd said "It just works" and he though it was good enough, so he rested.
---
Some of the higher levels are strolling round with their full on family or at least SO.
---
Yikes man, so much hate over an event that in the long run doesn't even matter. I think you'd be much happier if you just accept that it's going to happen no matter what unless they make a level cap for the event which most likely they will not.
---
Oh wow, thats kinda unfair üòÇ
---
r/iamverybadass
---
A lot of lv 50-60 are someone's 5th character and perform just fine, maybe even better than someone's lv 200 first character. 
---
But yeah, lower than that and you're potentially costing the team damage
---
Crippling makes sense. 1-2 on crowd control, one crippling, and one with monster dps. So, 2-4 depending on if you crippling teammate is also your dps.
---
We could pool our extra cloth together and craft 3 massive socks to shove in Earls 3 frighteningly large mouths..
---
Yes, yes, yes, one thousand times yes
---
Found the incel \^.\^
---
Yeah I noticed this during the wood score challenges
---
The Collect Wood challenge quantity goes up per collection (e.g. You click on a log stack and get 10 wood scraps, but it only counts as 1 for the challenge.) Cheering for you on for getting that far.
---
Looks pretty good with the Elders battle coat.
---
That's a build I should try and optimize for my stream. I've done bloodied and Junkie tank I think a shotgun medic might be interesting. 
---
But omg I would have donated 1000 ammo just to watch that mothmode get in their shit and kill it
---
Well yeah, i clicked on a lot of wood already lol
---
This is not the place.
---
Try a discord or another sub (rhymes with 76 Bark it) l
---
Hey man knock yourself out. You have every right to build it doesnt mean you can't get banned for having a hate banner lmao.
---
Just a few tips i learned along the way: Get yourself Class Freak and Starched Genes.
---
Class freak reduces negative mutation effects by 75% and Starched Genes stops curing your mutations with Radaway or Rad showers and Rads never mutate you. Im running like 8 mutations and its much more fun this way.
---
Marsupial is great for getting around and reduces a bit of fall damage (This can be negated by 100% if you have 2 free falling pieces of armor)
---
Bird Bones makes you fall slower. Great for VATS.
---
Theres that one Mutation where you have 300% health regen and Chem effectiveness is reduced. Get health much easier.
---
Certain perk cards dont need to be equipped all the time, like for repairing and crafting. 
---
If you craft Ammo, use Ammosmith (more Ammo produced) and Super Duper (30% of double ammo). Gunpowder can be crafted with Acid and cloth and weights give you tons of lead(Silos, Green Lodge in Flatwoods, Charleston Fire Department, Monorail Elevator, the Prison. 
---
Steel is the easiest: Just pick up every gun after a fight ( i prefer Mole Miners they have tons of stuff) and then equip Scrapper. Now scrap all guns and armor, you get tons of steel. 
---
If you need mods for weapons, crafting and scraping them unlocks most of them. 
---
Tsking over Workshops rewards you with plans for weapons and camp items. 
---
Get the perk card for better selling and equip it whenever you sell or buy (CHR 3 for max card level) 
---
Exchange every legendary items you dont need for scrips. These can be exchanged for legendary items from the Purveyor at Rusty Pick. There will be a - 50% off Sale in September, best waiting for it. 
---
Some quests i recommend: 
---
Mayor for a Day in Watoga
---
Overseer Questline
---
Wastelanders obv. 
---
Main Storyline
---
The Wayward storyline (rewards you with a 3* legendary item of your choice at the end) 
---
Events i recommend:
---
Leader of the Pack: 3 easy legendary items for scrips
---
Uranium Fever: pretty easy Event for 3 guaranteed legendaries. 
---
Breach and Clear : Tons of ores (even more when you done the Motherlode quest at Hornwrights HQ i think) and tons of Mole Miners to kill for steel. 
---
AWOL Armaments : 2 or 3 legendary drops. 
---
Manhunt : can be done in a few minutes, just kill Mad Dog. 
---
Prison Break:  kill some Super Mutants, done.
---
Why are you making ultracite ammo for Collosus?
---
More damage
---
I just look at my Pip-Boy when he‚Äôs about to scream. You don‚Äôt get affected by it as long as your on your Pip-Boy.
---
Some Turrets just want to watch the world burn
---
I heard it's not a nerf. It's a visual glitch that only affects display number, it was on a youtubers PTS coverage. Angry turtle or innov survivor iirc. 
---
Long story short: if you add damage perks, such as bloody mess, heavy gunner etc, your gatling laser damage won't show a different number before/after equipping perk damage boosts. Visual glitch.
---
All weapon damage will be nerfed due to stacking bonuses, not just energy.
---
They fixed it a while ago, resets on Mondays now.
---
As a car guy, yes
---
K
---
He doesn't need help, he's made of carving utensils.
---
I first noticed one there pre wastelanders when I was trying to complete the nuka scavenger hunt but only recently have they become consistent.
---
Firework glitch till they fix it, if you have some, check to unuse firework and then check to use it your weapon does a super fast reload.
---
Because they have a very small peepee.
---
It's not a nerf, it's a calculation adjustment that happens to lower damage.
---
That is what they said and I remember reading that in the patch notes but I still was always able to buy it on Saturday since then. This is the first week that I haven't been able to.
---
They were holding it all
---
I stopped playing after the beta and jumped back in when the game hit gamepass. It‚Äôs been a lot of fun! Ran into some really nice people early on who gave me ammo and aids, never had a mic working so it was a bunch of thumbs up emotes.
---
Oh dear... I feel Sofia is going insane after all. xD
---
I have her quest line finished on my main character, romanced her and all... Yesterday I got the "Ally: Crash Landing" mission again, wanting me to her her out of the bunker... xD
---
ok thanks
---
That ia what is called a nerf
---
I feel bad, I once found someone‚Äôs loot in a blast zone that pretty much had their entire stash, waiting to see if anyone came for it before picking it up
---
My dog smokes. Should I worry?
---
It still works
---
They are extra but, yeah - obviously ;)
---
There isn't a quick way of getting them, because you can (and will) be screwed over by RNG.
---
I did both pioneer scout dailies every single day and got nothing for several weeks.
---
1400 hours played here. And i reckon a third of that has just been helping people. I am now here to make sure everyone else has a good time by helping out where i can and providing things they want/need. i buy magazines and bobbleheads and usually sell them for less than i paid in my vendor. I sell all the serums at a reasonable price. I give people things they might need. I usually trade/sell things for less than their worth.
---
Yes, because that‚Äôs not a dog...
---
Theres always a chance for 2 to spawn, that place in The Mire seems to have the highest rate, though I don't know if theres a difference between the one in The Forest and the Savage Divide, this is just going off personal experience (Further to this, while there is a 2nd sheepsquatch nest in the forest event, I've never actually seen a second one there, only in The Savage Divide and The Mire). Its a hassle when you don't have enough players doing the event to melt them before they maul your Brahmin, I like to bring my Gauss shotgun along for this reason, it's usually enough to get the job done.
---
It's different though.  A nerf is an intentional weakening of damage.  This is to make damage calculations simpler.
---
Those level 0 players really are crazy.
---
Looks like Flannel Shrit and Jeans plus a cowboy hat. I have a black one but am not sure I have seen a brown one.
---
I had no idea! I thought something glitched out, but good to hear it's a very rare spawn then, thanks!
---
Lol.
---
Ask mom to get you some Taco Bell. Take a nap.
---
Not what I'm referring to.
---
I'd say chances are high it has nothing to do with you changing your PSN name. (I did it twice, and so did several of my friends, and no one ever had an issue with it.) 
---
BUT, there is a bug going through the game (afaik on all platforms) in general where the friends list does not load. I think it's around for a few days now, so don't worry yet.
---
It is almost definitely not on your end.
---
Great info! I‚Äôve seen a couple player vendors selling the unyielding armor plans but their level was around 45. I‚Äôm gonna focus on a build party today and see how the bonus is
---
Yeah double the legendaries is always nice assuming you have the man/fire power to take them both down haha
---
Yeah but you should do it at least once for the experience of running for your life
---
You felt that tingle on the back of your neck, you hear the door creek open, you feel the hot breath of Todd Howard grazing your ear. Don't be alarmed. Your in a fallout 76 subreddit
---
Ah, I see.
---
This this so much this. It's infuriating.
---
Its just ammo,no need to be a vindictive turd towards low levels who have joined a **PUBLIC** event that has no level recomendation.
---
If you burn through THAT many resources for this event, than maybe you need yo get your own shit straightened out before bitching out other players.
---
id be more surprised if anyone even bothered to go collect the Ore needed to finish the event, and to get better rewards.
---
I finally obtained the guass minigun.
---
Pumpkin spice came early and the house is set to vote on legalizing marijuana in the US.  This year just might end on a good note!
---
I‚Äôm cool with variety.  SBQ for repair kits and colossal for notes and scripts (cursed weapons).  Not to mention miner mask making a good barter chip.
---
Ah forgot about that. I have fo1 so carry none and don‚Äôt use weight red perks except bandolier
---
Collect the ore is the main goal!!
---
Maybe the owner of the camp mistreated them in some way? Maybe he/she did not give the turrets enough oil or attention?
---
Or maybe the turrets are just 'teething'...
---
Yeah, without pay to win, it's essentially impossible to not have to carry junk.
---
The brown one is an atom shop item that comes around whenever the western duster shows up in the shop.
---
It‚Äôs actually 4x, excavator was what I lived in for the longest time.  Calibrated shocks and the pass bonus for the PA gives 200 carry weight.
---
Be not bloodied for 1 second, and take a pylon.
---
A bit of nostalgia for the older games and then my fps drops to 0 the second i want to interact with my pipboy or stashbox and it all comes rushing back to me why i treat this game like a chore now and just sign on to do the dailies. And now that i finished the legendary run i dont even want to turn the game on. So way to go bethesda. Every update you somehow make your game less appealing.
---
Word, I have to reinstall but shoot me a message and I can hit you up when I‚Äôm in Appalachia ü§ô
---
Gotta crawl before you can run. Throw too much out there and we'll just confuse newbs.
---
Really isn‚Äôt pay to win is it lol. And u don‚Äôt need 95% of what your carrying. I won‚Äôt use 99% of what‚Äôs in my stash. 1000 cork? 8000 gold?  It‚Äôs just useless crap. If u keep what u need and keep 100 or so of each u shouldn‚Äôt have any issues.
---
I don‚Äôt know how but I know it would be super glitchy.
---
wtf why are you guys downvoting a post that lets you know about a bloody extra loot drop ON THE WAY OUT of the event? Its something you can get IN ADDITION to wendigo drops.  Have any of you even played it yet or are you all just circlejerking speculation because none of you can launch a nuke? This is why I don't participate here ffs
---
you're all very special people
---
Quad is nice, keep the freeze up without having to reload mid-snowstorm. limb damage or faster firing speed is also a good one IMO
---
Does it work on ultracite?
---
Where did you find the table plan?
---
Thanks for all the infos. I'll get those perks for mutation then! Crafting and scraping may be a good way to reduce the amount of junks I have actually!
---
October or November. There will be a delay, I guarantee it. Nothing has come out on time in this game and there's still thousands of unresolved bugs. Don't get your hopes up.
---
If you join the event with a team you can loot spawns that are tagged by your team, when we do it we all go in to alcove and 3 guys stay on earle and a heavy gunner that stays on wendigo duty. At the end of fight we don't even bother running out of the mine, just loot all the spawns. Gives you nice amount of acid too!
---
I‚Äôll take this into consideration too, most rpgs I try to follow a build guide and it does kinda ruin the fun. Not like I‚Äôm trying to pvp but I do want a solid build
---
Oh, well.
---
I'll exit the bathroom in the year 2076
---
Thank you. For example just a few minutes ago I got a J/25/250. Keep or scrip? I would put it in my vendors, but don't even know how to price it. For another weapon, that would be a pretty great roll, but Cryos remain a mistery to me.
---
Yeah, upstairs in the wayward bar, look for a guy in American flag clothing.
---
This reminds me of how Defending a Workshop sometimes has you Defeating the First Wave of.
---
the Cryolator IMO is more of a support weapon, good at slowing down enemies but not very strong compared to other options. the Crystallizing Barrel deals more damage with Demo Expert, a fun little Easter egg for the explosive happy
---
It is something!!
---
Don‚Äôt let anyone dull yer shine!
---
Congrats &amp; welcome too the point of the game where you‚Äôll have to figure out what cha wanna do wit yer time now that the quests are finished up.
---
The repeatable challenges drop them at the rate of 25% if you do those everyday you‚Äôll get a few. It‚Äôs taken me about two weeks to get 8.
---
It's never that easy. 
---
On my 3rd play through I had someone dump 30 legendaries on me. Would they have done so if they knew? Don't know. I callously swapped them to my main and scripped them all.
---
Same
---
Thank you for the useful info :).
---
I‚Äôve got heartaches by the number
---
Cazadores by the swarm
---
Sadly no because in another similiar encounter they die for a explosion
---
There are a set of super mutants in Watoga and one acts like a legendary. It does the mutation thing and it just has the crown.
---
Excellent. Thank you. Previously, I could not find meaningful info on if anyone had done so. Don't suppose you recall where they posted that? I am currently going through their old reddit posts, but no luck so far.
---
That would be something I‚Äôm definitely interested in.
---
tbh, not really because the dataminer regularly post updates on what's new.
---
you have to put the module half way down the cliff apparently. you can check a youtube video about it. 
---
It is still viable. was at one today buying stuff
---
That was a beautiful story, man.  It's people like you that make this game great.
---
Gladly upvoted.
---
I was in the same boat.  I ended up claiming the scrip because I worried it would expire when the season ended.
---
More like TESO is #1 franchise
---
üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
---
in my experience just dropping at someones camps is most of the time futile, because most don't check their camp before logging off.
---
Dropped my first nuke today too except I ended up nuking myself on accident lmao
---
Guess that is why I ended up dropping stuff in train stations. As long as someone can use (wear or scrip) them, I'm happy. I have multiple characters myself and  wouldn't mind if someone would drop something decent at my level 15 camp.
---
quad, fire rate, 90% weight reduction would be desired. 33% hit would be a good 2nd place major modifier, but heavies and VATS typically do not mix.
---
Does the dataminer show the preview of the skin or the actual in game skin? Some things can be missed, like many issues that the screaming eagle skin has
---
Way more satisfying then the spawn. 
---
Rusty pick might be the golden goose. Got 2 there.
---
Thank you very much.
---
I used to think it was elder scrolls too but fallout surpassed them with fallout 4 and fallout shelter
---
I have my camp there and it seems to be more popular than ever, have to relocated world 2 times at least every login. If you want to do it your camp needs to be exactly halfway in the cliff
---
I help out low levels even if they're alts, I prefer helping newbies but I need to get rid of my plans somehow since I don't care about vending.
---
I got some low level legendaries if you're in ps4. Lol
---
Good point. Guess a short text message won't hurt.
---
There's the wiki too.
---
Dude I solely agree with EVERYTHING you said in that comment. What baffles me the most and to this day is what I've gathered in FO76 is we're supposed to help each other, not bash one another and shit like that.
---
Yeah I  couldn't help but give away a 3 star tenderizer to a lower level dude as I  had no need of it and people like the to hang these on their walls
---
Yup, same here. I‚Äôve been telling my friends for months that FO76 has been the perfect quarantine game. There is so much to do, so I‚Äôm able to get things done each day, even if it‚Äôs just in a virtual world. And it‚Äôs a social game, so I‚Äôm able to get some social interaction with the world from the comfort and safety of my living room.
---
Darn. I'm on Xbox, at least with FO76 üòÇ
---
Riding Shotgun, it feels immersive while being enjoyable.
---
Found it, thx!
---
I think people go in there rocking their normal builds and gear thinking they'll just keep the spawn thinned out while heavies take down earl. Unfortunately, when there are six people that make it in, and four have that idea, it can really drag.  I'm hoping people will adapt, dust off the old ultracite and Final Word, and discover the bliss of full auto havoc. At least for that event.
---
Oh well. Good luck. üëç
---
Just drop it wherever you are, no one cares, they can find their own loot.
---
Compare polishment of TESO to fo76, and tes5 having 100 remasters and ports
---
Step-bro has a bloodied one. He's a bloodied stealth/commando build atm.
---
[1822 damage.](https://imgur.com/a/NHOjwy8)

* 1 master shotgunner

* 3 expert shotgunner

* 3 nerd rage

---
That's without tenderizer, adrenaline, drugs etc. Just the damage number.
---
With 1 drug? 2098 damage.
---
It's stupid.
---
I enjoy taking photos of the old vehicles, then editing them as if they were any old barn find I do for photography.
---
Imagine driving that through cranberry bog?
---
Bulking aluminum and lead will reduce its weight. Certain items need to be bulked in order to sell to vendors. Look at item value - any scrap with a value of '0' needs to be bulked to sell, sort by value to check. (NOTE this does not apply to player vending). Make sure you have no raw junk in your stash... Sort by weight to check. 
---
Bonus tips: 
---
check your gunpowder under misc. It's heavy but not junk and will not auto transfer to stash.
---
If you have weight reducing perks (travelling pharmacy, bandolier, etc) they don't apply to stash. Keep those on your person to keep stash weight down.
---
Sell off surplus Chems, junk etc. You don't need 500 antiseptic or 100 rad-x. For example.
---
Was that the silver/purple one?
---
Obviously, I meant their perk cards
---
Or Borderlands 3 on the mini-map it has a gold star icon for corpses that have legendary stuff or if I stop a legendary it‚Äôll appear in the mini-map.
---
I enjoy the red dress, but something new would be very much appreciated! I like my Hunter's coat, but sometimes a pretty dress is in order!

It's been done already.

Ditched mine... I use a mod in Fallout 4 called Ammo-O-matic, it takes the form of a converted library token machine. You simply deposit unwanted ammo and select the ammo you'd like in return, quantities are listed next to each ammo type for ease. And it got me thinking if a modder can create something that straight forward, then there really shouldn't be any excuse as to why the dev team can't.
---
Both. I‚Äôm an independent contractor and I make more profit off of their conflict than I would by choosing a side. And both Meg and Paige are smart enough not to try to challenge me on my decision. 
---
Better for them that I‚Äôm an occasional and conditional ally rather than a permanent and determined enemy.
---
I couldn't remember if it was double or x4 but its the only pa I have used in my 600+ hours in the game.

You can‚Äôt measure your own achievements with another person‚Äôs ruler.   As long as you‚Äôre proud of yourself, I‚Äôm proud of you too.    Congratulations, friend.

Just happened to me 5min ago I just got done with some building, logged to cook dinner, logged back in to find it all destroyed...I found a solution I followed these instructions  1.uninstall this trash game and all its content 2. Leave a 1‚≠ê review on trash game 3. Never touch this trash game again
---
I'd love more outfit to collect. But It's the grind for the one we can get now are killing me üòÜ.
---
Quickest way is doing the Possum challenges, got 8 in less than a week.
---
I just checked the wiki and it's an arseache to navigate on my phone plus the screenshots seem to be just previews which are a bit difficult to see. I'm thinking that in game screenshots may be easier on the eyes and I can show each angle of the weapon/armor
---
Bethesda pretty much intended Snallygasters to be F76's rendition of centaurs anyway: 6 limbs, tongue attack, acid spit, created from FEV, etc.
---
Wow... for a game that‚Äôs about end of the world you want everyone to play nice ü§£
---
Bro when we talking about IP and franchise as a whole , not Individual individual games  And fallout bring more money in then Elder scrolls
---
I am now initiated. I devote my life to the Mothman's will.
---
I am even lucky to have a group who can even kill the damn thing I launched 5 nukes and out of the 5 only completed 2 the other 3 people either just stood there or completely left
---
With damage *nerfs* and NPC being tougher in pts, id say those wolfs are like mutants from live servers in terms of toughness. He had no damage perks for shotguns.
---
I know where you can collect lots of wood friendo
---
 ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Hey congrats!
---
I was a high level player and months into playing before I ever dropped a nuke. I had completed everything except drop a nuke. I figured why bother when everyone else does and I had many dozens of queen kills by then anyway.
---
But then I felt that sense of completion and pride for launching that first one myself!
---
Hopefully you weren't the n00b in my session just now that launched a nuke and totally missed the alpha fissure LOL
---
Keep having fun!
---
I‚Äôve had this problem a lot in colossal problem event, it triggers when im in mid fire and he starts his scream. Once the scream wears off I can‚Äôt stop firing. This same thing happened way long ago, before wastelanders, and even in the beta. Bethesda should be able to fix it easy. Hopefully.  I‚Äôm on PS4 btw
---
800 is crazy, idk who here is saying good deal. 500 is market rate because that's what it sells to vendors for. Personally I sell serums for 400 and still can't sell them fast enough.
---
Also, as others said bunker for 17-18k caps is the only source. It doesn't drop so nobody will have extra plans. Earn the caps and buy the plan, or just look around at vendors for the serum.
---
Congrats. That happened to me just the day before. I also happened to be picking up some modules.
---
This is how I feel. I took an 8 month break or something and came back, got burned out trying to get all the Faschnacht mask (I did not in at least 100 runs- still no Raven). Wastelanders is a boring disappointment requiring daily voring repetitive tasks for months up up your rep for both factions, and the Legendary run was also a snooze. Like 5 things I wanted and a bunch of shit filler. The company is not great at formulating interest and seem to have fired anyone who cared about story a long time ago.
---
Most people sell it at 500, maybe 600
---
max if they‚Äôre pushing it. I sell it at 450
---
You probably exaggerating .. I generally sell it for 300-500caps depending if I make it or I buy it from someone. 800 seems steep but maybe people will buy as they have trouble finding it. Recipes go for a minimum of 7000 caps and that's at the low end if you get lucky.
---
And now that I finished the Legendary Run I should be receiving like 10 fucking atoms for each daily challenge not just a bunch of score that doesn't get added to anything. It's stupid.
---
If he had no damage perks, the damage wouldn't be any lower.
---
Shoot at their feet. Master Shotgunner, Skeet shooter, Demo Expert, and Bloody Mess. Also Frog Legs for instant height advantage and easy kills. Small guns and explosive bobblehead buff the damage too. Adrenaline is broken but when it was working you could run around one-shotting people with uncharged shots. It's by far the most unfair and overpowered weapon so don't be surprised if you get some salty messages. There's nothing worse than waiting 10 minutes to find a game, 3 minutes in the lobby and then getting 1-shot or lagged out by this gun.
---
Are you working at bethesda as some kind of finance manager to know about their money, lol? They remaster and port tes5 because people buy it, you know, they dont do it for charity
---
I would say Quad FFR 90% RW as well.  It actually takes quite a few shots to freeze the Queen solid, and the amount of freeze is determined by hits, not damage (i.e. a Bloodied Cryolator doesn't freeze any faster than a non-Legendary), so you're best off with the one that needs minimal reloading and can get the most shots off quickly: Quad FFR.  90% RW is mostly because it's an extremely situational weapon, and you wouldn't want to devote much of your precious carry weight to it.
---
you are supposed to turn it in to complete a side quest
---
#trufax
---
without grass it will look a lot worse in my opinion. I wouldn't need to rape the game to get the loot, it's a flaw in game design.
---
And what individual games, i compare tes online vs fallout online, i played both, tes have far more content (which locked behind $) and far more polished. BUT i still enjoy fo76 more, because its...fallout üòâ
---
Yeah, but you can be a jerk and keep it. Your reward? A half-pound misc item that can't be displayed. Just desserts I guess.
---
Just google it bro , it old news that fallout surpassed elder scrolls
---
If they didn't want the damage calculation change to be a nerf, they'd buff the corresponding perk cards to bring damage back up to previous levels.
---
That's mostly it, really.
---
If I join a server without friends, like when we had the Friends List bug last week, the whole thing feels kind of pointless.
---
They increased the amount of players needed to start a game. Also the limited time Nuclear Winter rewards were taken away so the adventure mode players have no reason to join.
---
Partly to mess with you, partly to steal resources.
---
Or give us the diablo gold pillar of loot right here.
---
You just adding comment without reading what the discussion was about? ü§î
---
That clarifies a lot, thanks. So is the Queen basically the only real use for the Cryo?
---
Because its a public workshop and maybe they ate hoping to PvP and take it or they just wanted to stand around doing nothing, you should ask them next time they loiter at your workshop.
---
If you got those scarp box‚Äôs things that you can send all your junk in your inventory to your stash I‚Äôll suggest going to the silos you can get a decent amount of lead from those weights in that gym/exercise room
---
There are a lot of items that have no display that clearly should and quite a few items that shouldn't have a display that do. It's weird.
---
Yes!!!!!!!!!
---
They're still tweaking all this in the pts.  Who knows what they decide to do next.
---
I prefer Raiders. I feel as if they provide alot more worth as well as character to the game. 
---
The plans you can aquire from trading Bullion, in my opinion, are far better from the Raiders rather than Foundation. I would take an ArmCo Ammunition Factory over a fertiliser machine any day of the week.
---
I was the same way... I went from Day 1 until late summer 2019 with strong daily play until I just got tired of the stupid bugs/crashes. Bethesda has a policy of not restoring characters, even if it was their fault when you lost literally everything, so I gave it up with a salty hard quit.
---
Once Wastelanders came out, I picked it back up and haven't put it down since again with twice the play that I gave it before. 
---
After speeding through the legendary run, I'm starting to get a bit fatigued again. I'm gonna give it a rest and just do my daily sell until the next run starts I think. Maybe casually collect more junk/scrap too.
---
It's still plenty buggy, but even since day 1, I've overlooked all that and still had a great time playing. I look forward to many more content updates!
---
Is there any particular reason why you want them?  Depending on your build, the Chemist Backpack and Grocer Backpack from reaching max affinity with the Raiders and Settlers outclass pretty much all of the Pioneer Scout Backpack mods and have zero downsides.
---
Anytime i get a legendary it doesn't show until i fast travel.
---
You can't EVEN display SOUVENIR items... Heck not even jangles. I was hyped to finally be able to display stuff only to find out most of the stuff you'd want to display can't even be displayed...
---
I've only completed Wasteland once and with the Raiders. Mainly for two reasons:    
---
The Ammo maker machine.    
---
They're more likely to survive than the Settlers and their comments are mostly hilarious.    
---
The Free State a-holes still attack me and I don't know if you can get Friendly with them. I'm not looking forward to the grind to max out rep for the Settlers but I want the garden plots.
---
Honestly this game is super obnoxious and I'm constantly bogged down buy legendary items now because of how often they are doled out. I wear 3 pieces of armor with plus one strength, and 20% armor weight reduction and 4 deep pocketed pieces and I'm still constantly overweight because of all the dumb Legendaries. Definitely going to just start dropping them at random locations.
---
Darn! Is being left alone with my copper extractor too much for some people?
---
Queen, bosses in general, probably yes.
---
Maybe there's some wacky PvP use for it, but by and large, you're not going to be mowing down standard mobs with it.  Cryo Cells are heavy and quite expensive to craft, as ammo goes, because they rely on Crystal and can't be produced by the ArmCo machine.
---
I‚Äôve explained it. Several times. Acting like you don‚Äôt understand means you‚Äôre either stupid, being willfully ignorant, or just trolling. 
---
You know it‚Äôs greedy you know it‚Äôs selfish.
---
raiders are more fun

It literally just stated happening to me. Logged and issue still there.
---
I'd suggest participating in boss events, like Scorched Earth, and building a stockpile of free Improved Repair Kits.  Those kind of render durability moot.
---
That's about as fair as you can make it. Some people just want to live in their little safety bubble.
---
Yes, yes, a thousand times yes.
---
nice big open flat areas are great for them to put down dozens of ammo factories
---
Thank you very much, very exhaustive.
---
That's awesome to hear!
---
If it was a steel extractor you'd be fine.
---
I honestly prefer divided before people came back. Super bleak and they had to work a lot more to develop stories that were interesting because there weren't any dumb NPCs that they thought would make up for everything.
---
I want the high capacity mod
---
I love this!!!!
---
I wouldn't try fast traveling. You don't have to fast travel.
---
It's OUR workshop now, our new home, comrade. üá∑üá∫ üá®üá≥
---
Regarding vendors the 'armor' needs to be separated into "Clothing" and "Armor".    
---
I can't recall the # of times I went to a camp b/c someone had armor in the list on their camp in the map only to find nothing but outfits and headgear.    
---
YAY! Another sh\*\* choice and more time sink and wasted caps.    
---
My CAMP is just N of the Wayward. I don't have things by level yet, but my two vending machines have labels on what's in them.
---
I agree. You can already sense the participation is starting to drop. I think most folks have plenty of worthless cursed weapons (looking at you harpoon gun) and most plans and maybe a helmet. Once you have that, the ammo investment isn't worth the reward
---
Even better use the sleazy red heart bed.
---
So how does it work when I join a nuclear winter match and there‚Äôs only like 32 people in there as opposed to the full monty
---
Ah, such is the life of the Wasteland.    
---
In keeping with such a world if you expect everyone to 'play nice and share a common' goal you misunderstand that world.
---
To make calculations simpler they could have also made everything stronger and all builds viable. But no as always they nerfed everything in an attempt to prolong the grind while saying ‚Äòhey don‚Äôt get mad we may buff something some day too‚Äô
---
Almost 700 hours here since Day 1.
---
Despite all the bugs, I love the game and tell my friends to ignore all the hate reviews out there. If you love it, you love it.
---
I quit for about 6? months then started playing again with wastelanders and haven't put it down since.
---
I enjoy urban exploration, photography, abandoned things, the art/style of the game, the story is pretty decent. I have a gallery of art from the game I enjoy doing stuff with.
---
I also just moved my camp closer to Vault 76 and started building gear for low level players and selling it for nearly free. I keep any low level legendary weapons, fully mod them and sell them all for like 50-100 caps depending on what it is. I lose time and money from the effort, but it's super fun. Whenever someone buys something, I check to see if it's a low level player. If so, I immediately warp back to camp and drop them any plans, ammo, some XP bonus items, etc and coax them over with the gift emote. It's fun giving stuff away.
---
What a great community too! In the nearly 2 years of play, I've only ever come across 3ish griefers. Everyone is so friendly, helpful and fun to play with in this game.
---
Oh, one other thing I picked up on, I haven't been using Reddit all that long, but another major game I play daily, their sub is just a toxic sludgepool of hate and complaints. I was curious to see how it was here in the FO76 sub, and I see none of that here. It's refreshing to see a community actually be nice and helpful to all!
---
Five other people left me to rot while they collected screws after I revive them four or five times throughout the event I just had to sit there until he was transported outside the mine
---
Did you tho?
---
I have a few items that were supposed to have been removed from my inventory at the end of a quest. I understand not being able to display those, but I sure would like to display my canister of dehydrated beef stock from Mama Dolce's.
---
We won't, we hope you get your fill. üòÇ
---
Agreed, seeing that Wastelanders was a upcoming DLC, is the reason I gave 76 a chance again. I played the first three months at release, but got bored and didn‚Äôt play again until wastelanders. Big improvement for the game. Hoping the new content this fall/winter will build on that. Even if it is those raiders, the BOS...
---
See, normally I'd say it's Seneca Rocks or Spruce Knob.  I'm convinced it's one of those.
---
But one of the curious things is that when they added the Morgantown map to Nuclear Winter, one of the developers had said that the "highest point in the game" was in that area.
---
And I've never figured out what they meant by that.  If they weren't just, you know, *wrong*.  Or confusing it with some other map in production.  Maybe if you're considering an antenna or a smokestack?
---
I've played the pts, there's really hardly any difference.
---
My heart sinks when I see "claim 10 workshops" for the weekly challenge.
---
I‚Äôve been on the receiving end of that quite a few times, so it‚Äôll be nice to dish out some justice to those level 100+ players
---
And thanks for the info!
---
Under 1000 is reasonable to me imo for like any serum
---
You're welcome!
---
I would just like to take this time to prepose the idea that while ridiculous this is a deliberate design choice due to the versatility and reliable damage output rifles provide, particularly in stealth.
---
It's luck of the draw. Most of the high dps builds can complete the event in a team. Unarmed melee, stealth commando, heavy gunner. Junkies or bloodied. I haven't tried anti armor at high health, so no idea if that is viable
---
That's what I mean by items that shouldn't have a display. They would never be displayable under normal means, so there would be no reason to give it a display graphic, yet they can be displayed. And then there are items that you can find, sell, break down or have no other use for that don't have a display graphic. It's very annoying.
---
Getting stuck every 10 feet in a trench.
---
My loot bag bugged out today too and is the paper sac, and not my cosmetic item (the blue gym bag). Probably just having issues today. Also died to a super lagged swarm of low level liberators that one shot me in the same game session... who dies to a low level liberator!? LOL.
---
I just chalked it up to some weird server issues or something.
---
i tried to freeze earl with an two shot cryo... didnt work well. Tried to freeze sheepsquatch imposer, didnt work well.
---
best result i got at the queen
---
Sometimes the daily for collecting inert bombs sends you to the converted munitions factory to find them. I'm sure I've probably spooked people a time or two when I went there to collect them.
---
I really think you'd be better served by the Chemist Backpack.
---
It basically reduces the weight of all of your chems by 90%.  This includes heavy Stimpaks and Super Stimpaks.  If you carry a lot of these on you, and don't use Traveling Pharmacy, that can be well more than the +60 Carry Weight of the High Capacity Mod, and it has no armor drawbacks.
---
yeah hate this who would want to play this shit if they have to wait like 15 min for the whole thing to start
---
The lv gap problem will be fixed soon and as for stash junk takes up a lot so there is an argument for the premium First if youbdont want to micro manage inventory as much. As a day 1 player I only stated first after Wastelanders Earned my further monitary support.
---
That's why you have a 4Runner's along, it gets the Jeep(s) unstuck ;)
---
Many true stories.
---
Dude I hate the golf skirt. It‚Äôs so ugly! I have a melee character and enjoy role playing as a mad golfer. (In fact, I‚Äôve just been blessed with a bloodied golf club, so I think it‚Äôs finally time to bring my character over). But I usually end up wearing the male-looking golf outfit. Come on I just want a cute golf outfit!
---
I also bought tricentennial and I had the same exact experience as you have had. It feels much more like fallout these days
---
Not making you bald and facial hair less would be great too. Does the same thing to the Green Hood which goes nicely with leather and travelling leather coat.
---
Not sure if it does this already because I haven't noticed but even if the hazards in the boss fight hurt earl himself. Falling ceilings, acid pools, it would make us work together more to get him to stand on a spot and take extra damage.
---
I absolutely refuse to sell anything to vendors because of this reason then they act slick and try to sell you the shit they just bought off you for 3 caps for 50 caps like shits cool
---
Earl is a weird hurry-up-and-wait situation, for sure.  It would have been nice if there were more things in that area to tinker around with.
---
I appreciate how the hood on Grelok's skull magnificently clips through the throne. Gotta love the details /s
---
It's just crazy to me that many items (like the aforementioned canister) have in-world models AND inventory models, yet are invisible in the display. The only restriction that makes any sense to me is extremely large items, and that barely holds because there are some gigantic things that can be displayed, like the wendigo colossus vocal sac.
---
For something worth so little, of course not. Iirc, Rank 2 gives you a 20% bonus to buying and selling. If Purified Water is normally going for 4 caps, that would only work out to a 0.8 cap increase. Not even a full cap difference and, in my experience, Bethesda likes to round down. This means there's no price change with or without Hard Bargain active. You'll need to either raise your Charisma or max out Hard Bargain in order to see results on such a small scale.
---
Nope, not giving away my spot.
---
You need rank three. Also use chems to boost your charisma. With rank two it might be raising the sell price to like 2.4 which it rounds down to 2.
---
Have you ever tried to do one where people aren't killing the adds?  You get knocked around left and right, debuffed constantly by their nonsense, and they chip away at your health quite quickly.  Add slayers have quite a bit of value in the fight, I would say possibly equal to the people DPSing Earlie.
---
I always look for the closest scrap box if someone is selling flux lol that‚Äôs my exact worry when purchasing it
---
Having this same exact issue, and I've hopped servers several times now.
---
Try something a little pricier. I works, and the higher your charisma is, the better.
---
OH yeah, that's a bonus! Hopefully you had others doing the event with you to help with the load.  Good times!
---
Second this. Just spent a couple hours pimping my spot out.
---
I started a little late, missed a few days, never did the NW challenges.  I finished last week.  It was a bit of a grind, but most days they would take about 20 mins to run through.  What rank are you at?
---
Sadly no as mentioned. It‚Äôs fairly common in people‚Äôs vendors though. So I always make sure to grab some if I see it. Preferably under 40 caps though...
---
That worked!!
---
I successfully farmed hemlock holes for a few hours, getting me tons of acid. Someone else owned it and I grabbed everything then set a timer, came back and did it again over and over. Saw the owner there a few times, he didn‚Äôt get much and probably was a bit confused.
---
He has lime disease. 
---
Temperamental. Sleeping and resting all of the time.
---
Yes!
---
I met a raider yesterday and after he gave me ammo I shit him. Sorry buddy your rules. 
---
Can‚Äôt wait for the BOS to arrive. They‚Äôre basically raiders without the charm. Open season!
---
Gotta be more specific in what you‚Äôre looking for and how willing you are to load up a few worlds to find a spot.
---
Love my current spot. Got what I need but rarely is someone there
---
Yes and I am on PC, reload my .50 cal and it starts firing straight away, everytime.
---
GG!! I'm going to have to check out this build video mentioned! I need to step up my game LOL
---
Nice setup!  That's a ridiculously fast kill.
---
There should be atom rewards for daily challenges past lvl 100 too but
---
No you haven‚Äôt explained it. For something to be unfair there has to be two sides.  You haven‚Äôt said who the other side this is being unfair too. Bethesda? Players who don‚Äôt want to put in time? People with a busy schedule?
---
Your argument above is ‚Äúpeople will be able together stuff off the atom shop‚Äù. How is getting cosmetics off the shop unfair? who is that unfair too?
---
You say it‚Äôs for free, like the player didn‚Äôt have to work for it?
---
Are you afraid of poor Bethesda not getting atom sales?
---
It seems a lot of my dailies are near workshops.  Often times I'll just go into sneak mode after I pick up something for a daily and, go use the restroom or pots of other things. Lots of times it's near workshops.
---
level 7 apparently
---
Sounds nice to me. Did two events back to back with 3 other random people who died nonstop for ten mins straight then all left without making a dent in big boi Earle. Would love for someone to put me out of my misery.
---
Im
---
Level 217 and have saved 18 level up points cause since 200 iv not been able to decide what perks to waste them on / is this gona work for me
---
Yeah stinger is the best one if you ask me.
---
Also gives the Commie Handmade the normal Chinese Assault rifle mag.
---
well they weren‚Äôt obligated to give it to players, but telling players that we‚Äôd be able to earn the atoms in game and then taking it away was kinda shitty.
---
&gt;innov survivor
---
The first tests showed lowered damage then bethesda said it was visual only.
---
The damage is still a steep nerf
---
Run away gun happens on PC too. Usually after the fright sequence.
---
Lame ass rewards. Meat Week is such a waste of time.
---
Ever since I've finished, I took to actually completing order of the tadpole and am now working on getting possum badges for that sweet stash box. Very time consuming
---
I got past this bug! So this happened to me this morning and I was able to get past the glitch by switching over to The New Arrivals questline and  talking to the overseer. She will tell you to go to AVR medical center to create the scorch cure anyway, so I think that‚Äôs where the glitch occurs. Just go to AVR after speaking with the overseer at her house and that should get the AVR medical lab terminal to analyze the blood sample like it should. 
---
Did you finish the duchess quests before finishing An Ounce of Prevention? I think duchess gives you the new arrivals quest after you finish all of her own quests‚Äì and so I think that is how the glitch gets started...
---
Done and done
---
Any chance you know what weapon he used? üòÇ
---
It's not a bug, it's a feature
---
;)
---
The 76 Dataminers Discord
---
Bingo
---
"Pools" are absolutely a thing for a lot of the legendary rolls in the game.
---
I've gotten the same item with the same three stars three times in a row at purveyor, I've had times where all I can get are Junkie's weapons (8 in a row on that one!  Different weapons tho thank god.) and I have twice gotten a random legendary drop from an enemy, gone to the purveyor, and gotten the exact same weapon with same stars back as a roll on her.
---
This comment made me irrationally angry.
---
-- A. Browncoat, esq.
---
I had the same with Earl. Was unable to respawn and died twice in the mine. Even though I wasn‚Äôt over-encumbered I had to spawn somewhere else on the map outside the blast zone, then fast travel to a team member who was luckily in the same instance.
---
Did the game just not let you respawn at all? Did you try a few locations as I found I had to sometimes try a few different places before it would let me spawn
---
Ahh. So no public post, unless the discord is now open to all? (saw mention of it in the old AMA thread)
---
Where is the power connector? I was trying to throw my vending machines in there as well.
---
I like messing with people and putting them on edge.
---
No, you just aren't willing to read to find out.
---
The legendary run gives you rewards at each rank. Some of those rewards are atoms. The only way to get those rewards is to complete daily and weekly challenges. 
---
If after you complete the run, you get more atoms for doing the daily and weekly challenges. You are getting more from the Legendary run than others who haven't completed it.
---
The problem is you still, wrongfully think of the daily challenges working as the used to. But they don't.
---
Daily challenges are now give score, not Atoms. Since score can only be used to rank up in the run, anything else, is EXTRA.
---
So again, the problem is you want the old way, and the new way. And that's why your are greedy. You want more than what you should get. 
---
And no one had to work at it. NO ONE. You're sitting there, with snacks and drink close by, pushing buttons and pulling triggers. It's NOT WORK. It's a game. People like to call it "work" as a way to justify how they choose to spend their time.
---
So no. You don't deserve more than others for whatever reason you think is justified.
---
The ammo factory is notorious for contesting, and for that reason I won't claim it... thankfully with the introduction of player vending I no longer need to. 
---
In my experience when a player shows up in my workshop dressed in a skeleton, sheepsquatch or superhero costume, I can pretty much assert that they're not there to help me clear out the infestation and 90% of the time that assertion is correct, lol.
---
I fixed this glitch just by starting The New Arrivals quest and talking to the overseer at her house. She then sent me to AVR med center anyway to make the cure and so I went there and the centrifuge worked like it should
---
No, it wouldn't go past the screen that just spectates you and says "click x to respawn" I tried pausing the game to manually pull up the map but nothing would. 
---
So I waited and that didn't work either.
---
Enclave likely would be on whitesprings. Go through a couple worlds to see where people put their camps and try to aim just a bit away from them.
---
Oh shit. Yeah it was pausing it that got it to work for me. I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you!
---
Thank you, so the Cryo has a very limited use. This explains a lot.
---
What does the mask look like?
---
I wish we could craft more than just certain weapons and armor. I've been trying so hard for a legendary .50 cal and I've been getting nothing but melee wepaons
---
The screw exploit with assaultron heads was patched, so this is the easiest way to get them. If you have 1st they don‚Äôt weigh anything. And they will always have value, everybody needs them.
---
Yes but on the Queen it works really well
---
Good man... I have a stockpile of mediocre to good legendaries I'm going to give away/sell for cheap. Just have to get around to it.
---
AFTER
---
I mean, I need to get that second season done in 3 weeks again ;-)
---
I know it works cause I dont keep it equipped and when i got to sell shit off near the end of my day I see the difference. Need to get it to rank 3 though and maybe some charisma boosting armor/chems
---
I can agree with that... I've finished the run as well, and now I feel like I'm "out from under" this game.
---
Right? Like I throughly enjoy some of these options
---
Yeah, I have seen it in action, it does do wonders :D.
---
3 real life hours.
---
I never noticed that! 
---
Finished last week myself. Taking a break before the next season.
---
For sure... teams are nice for the extra perks, but I never have my mic on. I don't feel all that connected to the folks I'm playing with. Team chat would help, but I think they must not be implementing it because the team supporting this game is not that large.
---
The turrets sometimes don‚Äôt respawn in after being destroyed by the last nuke launcher so sometimes is like going downhill in old snow.
---
Same, i really like the direction the game is taking. Still buggy, but as a returning player with over 1400 hours in, i'm definitly hyped for the futur. I'm just a lil bit worried about the post-season pass aspect of the game. As we no more gain something, it seems that it becomes useless to join events. Personally i'm planning to work on different characters next season, but if my gaming sessions aren't rewarded i may eventualy feel that i'm playing a lil bit for nothing. It concerns me a lil. It's all cool grinding to improove our characters, but at the end of the day...i'm improoving him for what reason !?
---
I may eventually feel the need to go play something else...
---
Scrapped content apparently. There are ways to get in there but there‚Äôs not much inside. Just some crafting benches, a sort of Oval Office, bedroom, and a terminal that can dispense presidential gear if you have ‚Äòpresidential seals,‚Äô which are unobtainable as of now.
---
I WAS WAITING FOR A BUCKET HEAD TO COME BY
---
Do you need inflict minimum damage to get Earl's rewards?
---
I agree they had to make the plot a little bit more elaborate with the use of terminals and notes, but the dialog options with people make the wasteland that much more enjoyable for me.
---
I agree.
---
Oh yah. I like that Idea lol
---
Lmao, its just a wee bit better
---
Had 8 rares spawn on the run I just completed, 10 total rares.  All crap, sadly.
---
Not bad for 15 minutes of work!  Also gained an entire level.
---
Agreed, the photomode and camera are nice. I like to take pictures of people in their wacky outfits and take pictures of cool camps.
---
Absolutely, it's fun to give stuff away. The longer you play, the more you drown in decent loot. 
---
A certain personality type is drawn to a game like Fallout. It's nice to see it shine through in the community.
---
I mean, it's just my opinion.  I still play the game every day, but it's a love hate relationship
---
Im glad to see everyone having the same or similar positive experience playing. Definitely a fun time killer...even if i spend most my days looking for screws
---
Depending on how many people show up, the boss has more hitpoints and spawns more wendigos.
---
I agree though, most fun I‚Äôve had in a while with this game!
---
Still working it it myself.  Think im 84 now. I missed 2 weeks of weeklies, and dailys
---
I hate starting new characters because I‚Äôm so used to my mutations, specifically marsupial and speed demon lol
---
Good to know, I had the same thought haha.
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm usually dead at this point but something feels... off‚Äù
---
You‚Äôre question makes no sense.
---
Yes, and bleeding all over the floor shouldn't make you an agile, sneaky, powerful, perceptive, lucky, intelligent demigod, yet that also happens. It's called video game logic. 
---
Attachments in this game work as tiers, with very few exceptions. The standard equipment is all base-level, and attachments largely work off the system of +2 tiers to a single stat or +1 tier to two stats. The drum mag is not supposed to be a mega spraydown bullet hose, it's a tier 2 capacity upgrade, which is +50%. Just like it is on all other guns with drum mags (except the .45 smg, since that works on its own system). If it was much higher, quad would be a truly worthless effect
---
&gt; Be aware that in order to loot the scorchebeast queen, each player has  to do a minimum of 1,000 damage on her in order to loot her body and get  credit. 
---
First I've heard of that... good to know. I wondered why once in a while when I join that event late and tag it at the last minute I don't get loot from it.
---
Its all good, thanks. I just wish they could fix those bugs
---
Raiders feel like crappy edge Lords. I hated how much drama was on their side and, a lot more people died due to stupid shit when you choose raider. Also, you can't steal from people if you've killed them all. Could've enslaved people but, no. All in kill steal and wreck up the places that provide stuff to steal. Settlers are not great either. I've played both ways but, story wise I choose settlers. They're also more valuable to me. I like using farm tiles more than making ammo. With 76, I'd prefer an independent approach or, even have the overseer lead a team.
---
How do you place items not in the camp items list, like the tp rolls. I think that would be the only thing really needed.
---
It's really quite simple to understand.
---
It's boring now. Camp objects and plans should be 10x more or something. Not just 4 or 5.
---
Also, when doing the Davenport "Photo Opportunity" quest you can choose to take pictures of The Foundation and sell them to a person at the Crater. You'll get raider rep and still get the treasury notes for the day.
---
Then explain
---
Only gold bullion plans allow you to craft weapons and armor with modules. The fixer isn't one of those items so you will have to get it from the Purveyor or legendary drops.
---
Why? Rifles already dominate every single aspect of the game except sustained DPS in group boss fights. They even still dominate DPS in solo boss fights where you can sneak properly. It's hardly a balancing factor, but the closest thing we have right now. Do you really need an even bigger gap between rifles and everything else? This is a badly needed buff to pistol builds, trying to turn it into a rifle buff is just stupid
---
I still have yet to launch a nuke. Level 200 and my build sucks. I just want to be able go nearly one shot everything like other players do.
---
I haven't seen it on a public server yet but I did launch a couple solo tries on my private server. 
---
 I failed the event the 1st time because I ran out of time but finished it pretty easily the 2nd time when I was better prepared.
---
 Since I finished the legendary run I haven't really logged in much which is probably the reason why I haven't seen it on public yet.
---
Because after end game, there's not much to do?
---
But tbh farming salty tears is fun af.
---
I uninstalled it this week after about a week of playing. I'm sad to say the overall experience on 76 was: Average.
---
Bases and camps were awesome though.
---
Camp visits and cool costumes are another plus for me as well. 
---
Snapped a pic of someone that ran in to complete an event with me the other day, I never saw the outfit before. Looked like a christmas mrs clause outfit with a pilgrim hat on! I had to chase them down for a few pics.
---
I went to a camp once, and the owner was hanging out at his convenience store themed camp at the "register" Whenever someone came in, he took a photo of them. I thought that was kinda fun, so I stopped to do some poses, and then took some pics of the both of us as well.
---
The living room in my own camp has all of the plushies sitting down watching TV, some on the floor, some on a couch. Someone stopped by for a visit, ran around a while, then got out of their power armor, changed outfits, then sat in different spots in my living room and was still for a while, I can only assume to take photos of them self LOL. I got out of their way, and took a few photos of them sitting around my living room too. 
---
These are fun interactions you don't get in any other game.
---
You do know you can move around the area yeah? You don't have to stand at the bottom of the shaft.
---
also stop dying so much.
---
&gt;a lot of work for you
---
.. Lol
---
Display casesüòè
---
I get the impression that sort of thing requires pictures.
---
I really wish there was less cute stuff and more wastelandy stuff. üòÖ
---
About 600 hrs in. I have 8 on display in camp
---
Full unyielding pushing most SPECIALS into the 30s. I usually have about 27 luck without food of chems
---
Once you know the plans you now have a chance for that weapon to drop at an event and it will have stars but you can‚Äôt make it legendary you can just craft the regular one which I think of as legendary already it‚Äôs a cool gun
---
This 100%! I started playing the game as a way to hang with my brother as we quarantined in different cities. We still play for a bit almost every night as a way to catch up.
---
My wife's Idea lol....she plays too
---
No, not really. Slap damage was removed well over a year ago. Just a fanfiction for reddit
---
Clearly you can‚Äôt explain it and so you have to resort to insults. So my original assets to that it doesn‚Äôt make sense stands and you know it. 
---
Later.
---
Grave of the firefly's?
---
Plushie week has been my undoing. RIP, Freetoms. Altho I did pass of the Grognak and Grelok plushes, and that monster VB 2k.
---
Yeah. It was terrible before Wastelanders.
---
Not seen this personally
---
Yeah. Probably the best way of "farming" them is ghouls, since you will get the party ghouls that drop 2x of three random chems and psychotats is one of them. I'm also pretty sure you can get it rarely from the raider collectron, so although not the fastest way, it might add up over time
---
Well any event will get boring if you play it enough ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Wouldn't that be nice?
---
But no, you can't craft a Legendary Fixer directly.  The Legendary Modules only apply to the gear purchasable with Gold Bullion.
---
So starting fallout 76 is ehhhh..
---
Endgame fallout 76 is EPICCCC
---
It's a hacked weapon. As in, 100% hacked. Not sure if the base variant exists in the dev room, but I know legendary variants do not. This was spawned in by a cheater. Wouldn't touch it if I were you, but considering bethesda unbanned everybody who owned shit like that after a week, there's realistically not much risk behind it
---
Yeah, was gonna say this too.
---
It‚Äôs bad ass and got a bad ass light
---
Pistols are already extremely light as is. There‚Äôs no reason to run packing light with them.
---
And as you mention, there lack of a weight reduction perk does nothing to balance them out with other classes of weapons. The only thing this change would accomplish is giving rifles a quality of life perk that every other build has access to without adding a buff to them like some of the other weapon weight reduction perks do. In addition, because packing light is in agility, it forces players to make a choice - do they want the powerful agility perk cards, or do they want their carry weight?
---
More wendigos spawn sure, but I don't believe it effects the bosses HP.
---
Vendorbot Phoenix in Watoga, but it took a lot of server hopping. I think it took me like 20 attempts to finally find a server where he was selling the end tables plan.
---
I will take a picture of it when I get on and I‚Äôll show you. I just did event twice first one was the first one I failed and second one I got a shovel which I bought that and a pickaxe for 1200 caps all together
---
So, when i am stalking and they ask me ' are you stalking me? ' i always say ' ehm, nooooo'
---
Yes...you can put a jet pack on the torso of the SS that alone should make you wanna get the full set and look like a shock trooper from Star Wars
---
Can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre lying to sound cool, or just stupid and never noticed that orbital strikes do not work on CAMPs anymore...
---
I usually have my phone on me, and just use it to message people if im dropping off stuff at their camp. I had to do it the other day when unloading some 38 that normally would just sut in my vendor for 0 caps. 
---
Levels of players dont equate to what is in their vendor either. If its an alt, they might be selling non-stop legendaries through it while running scrip and other work through. I know i do.
---
I think if you gave us some info on *why* you got bored within minutes, we could tell you whether we feel you'd still be bored today.
---
They've improved some of the intro quests. Beyond that, you will have to play a few days to fully enjoy the new additions to the game. 
---
Spending an additional few minutes in the latest fo76 won't change your mind. A few hours? Maybe.
---
I'm noy resorting to insults, I genuinely believe you need things explaining with pictures.
---
You can also just edit your character while you're in game. The Change Appearance button is on the game menu once you're logged into your toon.
---
I haven't messed with it yet so I'm not sure what all you can change.
---
I never used bos but I love my unyielding secret service armor and after it taking me 80 rolls for both legs I‚Äôm not changing it. Arms and chest only took me two rolls
---
Secret service has upgrades. Limbs go up to 53/53/something, chest is 113/something/something
---
Take what you loved about Fallout 4 and add a bigger + more diverse map with the ability to sell your gear to real people instead of an NPC haha.
---
I‚Äôve been playing since launch and I can say the game is not at all what it used to be... as far as glitches and bugs. The Wastelanders DLC added NPC‚Äôs everywhere and not just bigger named locations.
---
Ive stumbled upon a couple different random encounters already and still finding more! They fixed the one issue I had with 4... the dialogue system. It‚Äôs back to the classic menu style like the first games.
---
You would have the best time playing as a Lvl 1 character, that was you can‚Äôt fast travel to every location for a Quest and be done with the game in 2 days haha. This ‚ÄúMMO‚Äù can very much be played as a single player title.
---
Hope this helps your decision to join us! Maybe I‚Äôll see you on the trading sub.
---
While I agree with the idea, this is both a tweak and a nerf because the changes are designed exclusively to lower stacking multipliers. As in, things are only lowered, not increased
---
IMO, across the board, they really should cap it at 30 seconds.  60 seconds is a really long time for most Events.  I get that they want to punish repeated deaths, but if a player has already gotten their timer up to 30, that means they are dying a lot already, and in all likelihood, they're going to die again.  So, continuing to rub it in and pile on the penalty doesn't make sense.  What are they supposed to do?  Leave the Event and the loot behind?
---
It was a thing way before this event. I‚Äôve fought that thing like 8 times if not more. He‚Äôs a lot easier then earl. It use to be like 4% but they changed it to 10% so it was easier to get him.
---
Except nothing really mattered because everyone was dead anyway. Yes, they did the best they could with the stories, but I would‚Äôve much preferred being dropped into the later stages of the scorched plague when I could still aid survivors and influence the world through them - what we were left with was making a sacrifice for the country that no-one would ever know about. Poignant, I suppose, but an RPG where I only help people that are already dead/I can never actually meet is largely not why I play these games.
---
.. Nice üëåüèª
---
Legendary perks are going to drastically increase the power level of players.
---
1700 caps is nothing...
---
But the boss itself is extremely squishy after all pylons are taken, it‚Äôs not a huge bullet sponge to battle and that makes it quite balanced.
---
A lot of down votes. Guess cheating is more common than I thought in this game. Sad.
---
I've tested it with level 4 what rads. You will still get rads but very slowly, so slowly that ghoulish and rad sponge is even stronger
---
They all come back eventually, it seems.
---
It normally just stores all the stuff in your stash
---
He has a chance to spawn in what are called conflict areas if they are nuked. This was how he was first introduced.
---
So I bought plan for 5k caps about two months ago. I went to purveyor and with in 4 rolls I got a mutants three star. It was good but not what I wanted then with in a week she gave me a zealots fixer which was the best prefixes but a zealots. Then on amazing night like a month ago I only could do three rolls and with in those three rolls I got 3 bloodied weapons which is amazing since I‚Äôm bloodied. First was a lever action then my first bloodied fixer then bloodied Tesla. Since then nothing but crap from her. But you will get lucky so just keep going to her or find one from a vendor. I can trade you one of the other two fixers I have.
---
It‚Äôs all a learning experience and if they are on your property take some berry mentas Make sure they are alone and kill him if he‚Äôs a high level he knows the rules
---
Yea i get lazy too and sometimes just login for 10 min and dump some scrips, that‚Äôs about it. I can see the complete removal of earning atoms is a game changer/killer to some.
---
Event is pretty fun; it‚Äôs just a shame the rewards are godawful. The reclaimed mining mask is the only thing that‚Äôs even vaguely desirable.
---
Isn't the title for the question, and comments for elaboration? Seems okay..
---
I went with Settlers because grinding Raider rep feels easier, I did both until i had to fully choose and found the Raiders more interesting other than the quest to help program the Motherload and you can teach it to Charisma it's way around rather than Strenth or Intelligence/Perception. Always fun frustrating a scientist. Some of 76's best dialogue there.
---
Grow up.
---
Started playing 2 weeks ago and it took me a few hours to get familiar with the terrible UI and menu buttons. The game feels like a console port. I‚Äôm used to it now, and I‚Äôm having a ton of fun. The in-game community is friendly and willing to help if you have a mic.
---
There still isn't much of a need to choose, 11 points in agility is enough for all the important perks a rifle user would need. The rest is optional convenience. And with legendary perks seemingly around the corner, there is going to be even less of a need to choose, you'll have more than enough for all your rifle needs. Again, this is a pistol buff that was badly needed. It's not even enough, pistols still need more of a buff. Trying to turn it into a rifle buff feels like a parent wanting a gift on their kid's birthday
---
Chill
---
I was the one running around, clearing spawns and shoting at him, so I couldn't stand at one place mate. Also it's easy to not die. But when there is more than two people üòâ
---
Drum mags in general in 76 are a joke. its weird.
---
No, it'll just keep your stuff stored in your storage. You'll need to put every back for sale tho if you move the machines
---
Watch out whenever someone says about dying we have guys like the one at the top telling you not to die as much just like he told me. Like sorry not everyone has legacies or the god roll fixers or handmade. So when you‚Äôre the damage person and not paying attention you might end up dying. I would love to see the guy that goes on every post to say not to die as much I would like to see his times for the event
---
&gt; Do you die cause you straight up get one shot
---
Not who you were originally responding to, but I've tried the unarmed bloodied option against Earle myself. And yeah, you get one shot.
---
I find when I'm at 20%hp (for Nerd Rage) one kick from Earle is enough to wipe out that amount of health in one hit. And yes, I have Blocker 3, doesn't seem to work though.
---
First world problems.
---
Thanks for the info. I‚Äòm gonna scrip it so no one can pick it up.
---
And they are also not in any way related to the damage adjustment. If they both end up coming with the next update, it will be coincidence. Legendary perks were supposed to come last year
---
No, I just wanted the time cap at thirty sec, just like the SBQ
---
To be fair, Jangles is absolutely massive.
---
The removal of the Atoms had no effect on me as I am a fallout 1st member and get free Atom's every month so I never even did the challenges prior to the legendary run.
---
 I'm level 430 and have played almost every day since Beta, I think I'm just burned out a bit.
---
I have done just about everything there is to do except for collect all of the colossal problem rewards.
---
I found the rewards ok. I got three legendaries (one of which is good enough to put in my store) 300 caps and some miscellaneous stuff.
---
I don't think I'll make a habit of launching a nuke by myself just for that event, but I'll join wherever I see it.
---
Good on you, but I doubt it'll do much. The people who spawned in things like that probably don't have any issues with duping a few dozen more copies or just spawning more
---
I had no idea about this. I cant believe I didn't lol
---
Oh, yikes.  Well at least it'll help compensate.  I've played on the pts though and the damage doesn't really concern me.
---
I found that once they took out the "bugged cosmetics" and people finished up the legendary run the wait times tripled at least, I like the constant reward of a new cosmetic every few matches and when they took it away I went away even though I like NW a lot more than I thought I would.
---
If you plan the challenges you can get 13 in a couple of days... on my last character I got the the armored and high  capacity in a weekend .. it just takes planning and organization.
---
Also collect a load of part for stings and things ASAP.. you can server hop and it will trigger
---
Pretty!
---
Interesting. I think I'll play around with it a bit tonight on the pts and see how it goes. Thanks!
---
I‚Äôm glad I got all plans with in first few events and I got the mask today. So happy mask is the best thing. I now have everything from event. Wish the boss dropped repair kits tho. Take away the treasury notes and Put in repair kits
---
Sounds like the explosives nerf - no gradual tweaking but rather a huge cut that‚Äôs never been revisited.
---
Ok thanks!
---
Thank you! Was mentioned (EDIT by Intrepid359, and I hate Reddit's nesting system) that you had found the answer and was searching your old posts so I can bring it up next time the circle spins and someone has a new "system". Appreciate it
---
If you don't have them already I recommend the Patterned Fringe Dress and Vintage Green Dress.
---
Those are the only two I think are cute, but I'd love more options myself.
---
That's not a lot of caps if you know how to farm caps and conserve what you do have.
---
I have a stack of about 20 encrypted cards that I have bought because there is nothing else for me to buy in the game with caps.
---
If you store it, everything goes into stash. 
---
If you did want to save all the listed items, blueprint and save the vendor before you store it. You can place it complete assuming you still have all the listed stuff.
---
Single shot not possible.  But I‚Äôve seen Earl melted in 10 seconds.
---
Yes. I believe it's 50.
---
I've often wondered why Bethesda didn't create a mode that excludes PvP... oh wait, that's the major selling point for FO1st. Seriously though we had survival mode and then NW, two PvP modes, is it not reasonable therefore that adventure mode should be reserved for those don't wish to engage in it?
---
Say you fast travelled to a claimed workshops, you spawn in and find that somebody has taken the time to build it up, do you take that as evidence that the occupant is not in it for PvP and move on? Or do you take the view that since the workshop mechanic facilitates PvP, to hell with it.
---
I guess it really comes down to a moral compass, and since Bethesda are not likely to remove the feature, my hope would be that PvPers can make the distinction and act in good faith.
---
Raiders because I hate Ward, Sammy and Derrick.
---
The caps just kind of sting, it's more the flux that chaps my ass.  If you think about it, that means a prerequisite for this event is running a silo.  Which just seems dumb to me. Needing flux to initiate an event is a lot to ask and makes it harder to justify replaying this event.
---
Weird I didn‚Äôt think I had that many, guess I‚Äôll have to re-evaluate lol
---
I‚Äôm not certain but when I went alone to fight him, his health went down way faster then when I was in a group. Could be I was just doing more damage alone haha idk
---
Lead probably, but steel very easy to farm from scrapping weapons with Scrapper perk. Acid - sometimes they dropping teeth - so technically there is acid. Usually i'm spending 5k 0.50 cal ammo per event fight. Quite expensive when comparing with SBQ (even more if using Prime mod). So repair kits will be great to have as loot (even more then ammo), IMO.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll prolly do that so I don‚Äôt hav to relist it all
---
Let it sit for ten minutes you will get to and you will get your rewards I had this happen during encrypted once and I didn‚Äôt wanna lose my rewards. I let it spin for ten minutes and I could then respawn. I had it happen to a queen fight right when she died. But I let it sit and when I respawned all rewards popped even the flux. Never leave let it sit for a little and you will get it.
---
If you're building and look at the info card in the top right corner, somewhere there will show a tally. I believe lights do have a limit but I don't remember what that limit is, off the top of my head.
---
I think there‚Äôs still fun can be had. The thing about atom is they make you play a little every day on a somewhat consistent basis, without it I login for 10 min on a few days then maybe play five hours straight on Saturday, the ‚Äòminimum‚Äô daily play got significantly shortened.
---
I chose settlers for the vault raid because I liked the characters I met doing their quests more. Penny, Jen and the soldiers all came across as interesting folks to me, who I was happy to help with their various problems and go into battle alongside (but why couldn't I rescue Gina?). Whereas with the raiders I felt the writers were trying a little too hard to make the characters seem kerrr-azy, and they just didn't click for me.
---
Since then of course, I interact a lot with Wren, Roxxy, and Ward. And I can definitely see why people get sour on the settlers when they're mostly chatting to Ward. It's not a great look that Wren generally comes across as more professional than him.
---
In random encounters I think I still prefer settlers though. Raiders often feel a bit try-hard with their boasting and constant efforts to sound tough, especially when I've just saved them from some terrifying molerats.
---
If you can update me on how it goes, I'd appreciate it!
---
Every time I go from steam to Bethesda.net to run the PTS all my atom shop item get unselected.
---
yeah, i know, but a) i can't find them anywhere (and shouldn't need to hunt for them), and b) every other person who has this problem will need to ask as well.  Bethesda needs to fix their mistakes
---
Thank you. I'll keep that in mind next time
---
I see them a lot in the bog and southern savage divide, near the fissure site
---
Started w the BETA on Xbox, left about the one year point. Rejoined on PC with Wastelanders and have enjoyed it but I‚Äôm not launching nukes or trying to melt the queen/Earl, just looking to have some fun. (And kill time until 2077 hits.)
---
He wasn‚Äôt asking you what are ‚Äúthey‚Äù (Bethesda) supposed to do haha üòÇ he meant the player. He‚Äôs agreeing with you!
---
I had this happened during third event on first day on consoles. I died and when I respawned he died so I said oh well his loot was trash. Went to chest for caps and junk put on Chinese stealth suit and walked out. Had same loading screen I was pissed waited ten minutes closed Xbox down and got back into same server and that‚Äôs how I got my first cursed harpoon lol. Had all flux and stuff also but also got a furious sledgehammer.
---
Probably not. The Enclave likes to call themselves the US Government, but they‚Äôre really a shadowy group of  powerful usurpers who are also former government and military officials.
---
For me was like this: I didnt like the idea of buying fallout 76 when it was on sale in steam for the problems it brought at the start, now im level 51 in less than a month...nice
---
I'd re-buy FO1st if it had persistent workshops. You could build some really great places.
---
Agreed 110 pct!!üëçüëç
---
Will do!
---
that would be the idea.. if it was not for the fact that modus killed every human member in the facility, except for us new ones
---
Np! You can usually find this and more info at the datamining discord if you ask
---
Kinda of a side note I think the fallout universe should really expand to Europe and even China more
---
Man first time I saw a camp there was incredible, now it‚Äôs so common. I almost wish there wasn‚Äôt extractors there so it would be less popular, interesting as all heck space
---
Thank you!
---
I love the robots that explode. Hi ho silver.. AWAY..
---
Wait really? I didn't know there were no atom store rewards any more.
---
I'm sure that it is an atomic shop item.
---
I think it looks pretty nice
---
raiders are jerks and constantly threaten and insult you. why would you wanna join them?
---
Neither, I will obliterate any that stray too close into Enclave territory
---
Like i read my own thoughts.
---
Been bugs since launch but I've sunk many hours in to this game. Some bugs are maddening and sone bugs make me laugh. 
---
I still find it enjoyable to just wander around.
---
This is cool for rifles and shotguns. But quite ridiculous for Heavy Guns, cuz 30 - few secs of firing with .50 Cal, Minigun or Gauss Mini.
---
Yea earle occasionally wants to commit suicide by self-hanging, but don‚Äôt get fooled he could very well change his mind and vomit in your face the next second. I‚Äôve encountered this twice, both times when we gathered under his feet shooting upwards, he suddenly dropped in front of us and resumed his attacks. Just keep in mind when he‚Äôs about to die, radaway all your rads and keep your hp high so you won‚Äôt suddenly die to accidents. It‚Äôs quite chaotic especially the moment he dies. 
---
Also when you respawn into the waiting room and the shaft already collapsed, run downhill through the tunnel to the left of the shaft where others rush upwards, there‚Äôs sufficient time that you‚Äôll get to the cave and loot his dead body if you can find it.
---
My fo76 house is a lot neater, that‚Äôs for sure.
---
&lt;spends half an hour on hiding power lines going to the decontamination shower&gt;
---
&lt;glances at extension cords that have been running across the floor since April&gt;
---
&lt;keeps playing&gt;
---
I didn't move my camp for the first 60 lvls because of this, I gambled and found it worked lol
---
I found a swimming hole that spawns these guys every time in the mire so I dropped my tent there. I'll defintely do the mire event when it comes back!
---
Or joining a public world and wandering a nuke zone
---
I enjoyed logging in to do my Legendary Run dailies.  They gave me a reason to log on and play and do things around the world.  Now that I finished it I really haven't logged in for more than 5 minutes at a time and sometimes not even at all.
---
 I have a stash full of God rolled weapons with some legacies mixed in.  Have a full set of crafted thorn armor the way I want them rolled.  I have completed every main quest, side quest and hidden quests.  I've completed every scout badge, collected every magazine and every bubblehead.
---
 I have killed the Queen more times than I can count and have completed every event in the game more times than I can count.  I have explored every area in the game numerous times....ect..
---
 I honestly think I have played myself out of content and have grown quite bored without having something to log in for every day.
---
I love this game and will play it for years to come I am just starving for content.
---
So kinda like the cabal from x-files almost?
---
Oh yeaaa ....   Haha üëåüèª
---
There‚Äôs still challenges to earn atoms but no more dailies.
---
First sentence is title
---
*Leaves post*
---
Twice I‚Äôve froze during the event. I definitely prefer the sbq anyway
---
At least the drops aren‚Äôt really tied to him
---
Dis true
---
Limit is 50. 
---
Also: You really don't want to use all 50. Lights take up more than most items in your camp budget. So for every light you don't have you can have a bunch of other stuff. Also every light requires your GPU to calculate shadows as you move around. This is one of the reasons for the budget. If Beth just let everyone place all the lights they wanted your FPS would crash and you would blame Beth.
---
It wasn‚Äôt always like this. Before all you had to do was put a few bullets in her, or melee attack her a few times and that‚Äôs all it took. But people complained and got mad that so many people would join the event and just stand there or hide and not help out at all. Just so other people can do all the work for them. 
---
So now each player has to do 1,000 damage if they want to get rewarded. No more slacking off.
---
I had started one, though it kinda fell to the wayside lately.  
---
I was keeping track of things like how many containers (and the type they were) that I could use things like Pharma Farma or Can-Do.  If there were any interesting static drops there (like when you can find things like a breadbox consistently if I wanted to decorate my house) And an average of the scrap I got from the location so i could know if it was a good place to farm things like Aluminum. 
---
I know a lot of the information already existed out there, but it encouraged me to search places throughly, and to try and find every location.
---
Kinda went to the wayside when wastelanders came out and everything changed, many locations are completely different and all my notes are useless now. 
---
I‚Äòm still trying to keep a photo journal though.
---
I died right before our group killed him - the path to get to him was then blocked and I couldn‚Äôt get any of the rewards üò≠
---
I haven't tried that. That's probably a better solution!
---
If one of your teammates is still in there you can fast travel to them and get in there. Another tip is If you join a server and there is a alot of action at the mine, you can join one of the teams there, and fast travel to a teammate and join in on the event even though Its already started. That goes for fast travel bug also. üòÖ
---
Had the same problem, just started using a vampires gauss minigun. You're getting ammo back so it's not expensive like other events.
---
They're not going to make a mode and support the servers so one or two dozen players play it.
---
Nuclear Winter already has such a small player base outside of Events, there's just no way.
---
The vast majority of the weapons getting passed around were duped. How many legit B2525 handmades, BE90 lasers, BE+1P gat plasmas, etc to you think actually exist?
---
I hate that the cash shop only has a few items at a time. I would gladly pay money for a cute outfit but there's nothing. I get that they think people will buy more if it's more "rare" but instead, it just makes me upset that I can't customize my character while I'm actively playing.  The same goes for housing items. I think it would have been better if the store was always stocked then rotating sales or put more stuff up at a time. They've lost out on extra money from me.
---
He doesn‚Äôt need 500 water. Why would you give him that much?
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
What have weapons got to do with dying less? If anything it's usually dumbasses with legacies that die the most because buying a duped weapon does not make you a good player. I've done the event numerous times, without dying, using a jumbled mess of armor and a suppressor's combat rifle.
---
Played it roughly 20 times, gotten 18 harpoon gun and 2 shovels. I just want the pickaxe :(
---
I'd just buy it, but for some reason the cursed weapons are impossible to find in player vendors. Seen plenty of masks though.
---
THANK YOU! I now have something i can quickly buy if i'm near max.
---
Your friends list is too long probably. Microstutters can be caused by this. If your friends list is more than 1-2 on screen pages, try cutting it down to that size.
---
Sweet I placed my camp near a random spawn so now I have becket my raider bot and also a random at my camp. .cool as fu
---
Can we just talk about how you‚Äôve killed Earle so many times? What‚Äôs the key?
---
How many of those items are getting passed around *in general?*  The vast majority of trades I see aren't top tier at all.  So even if all high end weapons were duped, they're still a small minority of all trades in general.
---
There is a trick: Modus is both the blackjack dealer and the hooker.
---
I find writing it down helps me remember locations and loot areas. Comes in handy when the daily challenge is find a Bobble head. Then next time I don‚Äôt even have to refer to notes.
---
The wendigos are just screws and adrenaline. Nothing fun.
---
Same too, i tryed my best to not lose my mind with all those server disconections that was happening every 30 minutes or so lol. But yea these bugs and issues eventualy got me. Since then i always play a couple of weeks, intensively ( i mean it's the only game i play everyday ), but i quite for 1 or 2 months. The camp building system really saved the game, for me. I spent mAnY hOuRs building stuff. I eventualy found my self playing just for this lol. But eventualy...it takes atoms, if you see where i'm going with this.
---
Anyway, peace man ! ‚úå
---
How much is a nuclear key card worth
---
What is your Cha at? Not your spent points but the actual score. Hard bargain's effect is not linear. No matter how much you do on Cha and hard bargain you will hit a hard asymptope that you can't get past. If you are running unyielding and  have a high Cha, hard bargain may not get you anything extra.
---
EDIT: Here is the chart for it.  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UATScTi-Pz857eB4xyHrDwsS2M9eTJH2ZO6d9gWLW\_g/edit#gid=1897254939](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UATScTi-Pz857eB4xyHrDwsS2M9eTJH2ZO6d9gWLW_g/edit#gid=1897254939)  You will notice that for selling items hard bargain 3 gets you absolutely nothing once you have a 20 Cha. For buying items this is at 25. Even before then though you will find on low items cost items that you don't see a difference.
---
I've tried different perks but either I don't get one shot and have a lot of hp remaining or I get one shot and can't tell how much more hp I would have needed to survive, people have empath on my team, random food buffs, etc. I need more testing. I have lifegiver 3 right now and stay around 30% and it goes fine but no nerd rage even though I do have serendipity. I'm gonna try next time with nerd rage and lifegiver 3 cause I don't think I had it the first bloodied run. Also, endurance gives max hp and I do have 8 end.
---
I made the mistake of being in NW when the dailies reset too. It sucks. This bug was awful before seasons, but you think seasons would have been an incentive to fix it.
---
I mean China is just a crater in the earth now with how many nukes got launched at it. There would be pretty much no life there whatsoever.
---
Except the drum mag in 4 was a massive ammo boost for any gun where you sacrificed reload speed for a big magazine, and actually was that way in 76 at first. Then they nerfed the mod and made it entirely worthless compared to other magazine mods.
---
At that point what even is the point if all it does is add a few bullets to your magazine count despite visibly looking like it holds MUCH more?
---
What's the big deal about these pies?
---
I got an UNY +1INT Blocking (magic effect enabling) chest that is absolutely perfect for me. But I'm not rolling any more of it as it's easier to get the effects you want via trade on other pieces. But the jetpack on the chest is brilliant to have.
---
I thought the cause was being in NW before logging into adventure mode at the start of each Bethesda day.
---
I didn't know that what about Russia and Europe
---
Sorry for not believing you on your word, Buth in the name of science i gonna try this out now and this message wil be edit ive i have the answer ive its true or not!
---
8 treasury bonds, ammo of choice and screws begs to differ. I don't think so. The thing to do will be to nuke Earl, kill him, then the Queen to pop both events and kill them both twice.
---
I‚Äôm writing a novel
---
The "just don't die 4head" comments are pretty unhelpful. I try to be careful, but usually when I'm gingerly picking my way towards Earle's lifeless corpse as soon as he goes down, some bs instant damage comes from somewhere, which kills me and boots me outside the mine entrance. With no corpse loot.
---
If you die after the boss, you should just respawn (with no delay!) right next to the boss corpse. Even if you die while trying to escape, just respawn you back down in the main chamber again. Escaping the mine is an optional objective anyway, so that particular setback doesn't even matter, and the loot in the main chamber is more important.
---
Foundation thanks you.
---
They stated nuking each other before America and China did so I imagine there not in a good state either. Alistair tenpenny from fallout 3 came to the capital wasteland from the UK so it does mean there is still life there.
---
It's 50 and it even tells you when you're in build mode how many you have built out of how many you're allowed to build, directly under the description for the light you're going to build.
---
Cool. I have a similar place just next to my CAMP. It spawns the Scavenger Trader so I'm stocked with Longshorman outfits and clean spacesuits ;)
---
quite a good one tbh. Maybe a 3\* furious or 3\* instigating with some good minor and major prefixes. Maybe an Anti-armour 
---
It's just finding one that you can outbid someone on.
---
T65 provides the most DR, but it's not a HUGE difference. X01 is still viable.
---
It wasn‚Äôt his fault. He was attacked and acted in self-defense
---
I remember having a 80 round drum on my Handmade... Then they dropped it to 30.
---
Like, I‚Äôd rather have the armor piercing effect with Stinging for 5 rounds less lol. Pretty dumb on their need.
---
Actually, the higher you Cha the less you get from the perk cards. See the chart in my response post.
---
You may see some bump in caps as you hit certain rounding issues but the overall percentage increase from hard bargain goes down with increased cha.
---
Ummmm my 50k .50cal ammo would suggest otherwise unless you mean ultracite 
---
5mm and .50cal are both so cheap to craft. A trip to lucky hole is 1200 lead that's enough to make 120x180 .50cal ammo 
---
do the campfire tales event for bloodbug parts to scrap for acid otherwise cave crickets at tanagra town
---
run through west tek, uranium fever, line in the sand equip the scraper perk and scrap all the weapons for steel
---
I always have stupid amounts of cloth and don't know the best places to get it  cause I never need to specifically look for it
---
My record is 13 in one night.
---
Well with all cover ups wouldn't be hard to believe that some countries were untouched or at the least functional
---
I think the launch codes is supposed to act as that effect. Prewar, the generals would not have the launch codes until president authorizes it, i would assume.
---
Generals access bunker. President holds the ever changing code.
---
Yes! I also got it at launch with a friend and we stopped playing as it was boring then a few weeks ago I purchased the game on pc (I got it on xbox before) and told him that it was actually fun. They could've left out rose though. Shes annoying.
---
&gt;EDIT 2-WE STILL SEE NO ANSWEAR FROM BETHESDA :P
---
Do you really want a CM to tell you that they'll pass it up to the team?
---
How familiar are you with the nation‚Äôs nuclear missile defense system and security access protocols?
---
Yeah someone posted on this for me. If you‚Äôre on Xbox hit him up I think he had another pickaxe for only 666 caps
---
What about Ultracite power armor?
---
Do you think I could get Explosive along with that or would that be out of reach?
---
SH games says all PA have maybe a 10% difference. TYR said currently T65 and Strangler and still the best. I run PA full time I had T51b for queens and now have moved to T65 and have excavator when I'm junk running and farming
---
Yes i like the legendary run too, essentially it gives me a reason to play some every day and of course when I play I won‚Äôt stop right after getting all the scores. Same with atoms, I don‚Äôt really need them, still have about 6k don‚Äôt know what to buy, I also bought atoms with money to support the game which i think it‚Äôs very reasonable. Just like the SCORE points, daily atoms gives me an excuse to play lol, without it I get lazy and if I‚Äôm occupied by other stuff I‚Äôll just skip. My two mains are about the same level as yours and I still find interesting stuff to do when I play. Daily atoms is an incentive to play some every day.
---
I have 10 lights at the most and it‚Äôs telling me I have 21...
---
The reason I drew the comparison was to help people to understand my point that packing light could affect rifles without Bethesda needing to create a new perk card. It was not an attempt to say that rifles should be affected by the card because tank killer will now affect pistols. My argument is that rifles should have a quality of life feature that every other weapon type, ammo type and consumable type has had from the beginning of the game, and that packing light is a perk card that could be used to achieve this.
---
 Does anyone else have this problem.
---
Those are all over I took a pic of my behind the wheel of the one in the munitions factory
---
Ultra has higher DR, but not by much. Where x01 has a more ER and RR. Mine atm are
---
Ultra: 455, 395, 393
---
X01: 400, 455, 453
---
It sounds like you have 21 lights then. Neon signs, fire pits, etc all count as lights. Not just light bulbs or lamps. Anything under the Lights tab counts. As lights. For the light tally.
---
OMG, yes. Having armor and clothing separate in our stashes/vendors would be nice. Maybe I wish for that even more than for low level players putting up vending machines ü§î.
---
Nuclear winter is a different story. All I can tell you is it‚Äôs a top 30 title on Xbox right now and tens of thousand on pc.
---
You can downvote me all you want. It doesn‚Äôt change facts on how servers are populated.
---
Can you find these in the wild or are they atom shop items?
---
Yeah and who was in your team?
---
Ooh. Can‚Äôt wait.
---
Thanks for that! Seen a few ants at tea time. Be worth looking into when i get the recipe.
---
TSFFR is the best. Cryo's best use is against SBQ to freeze her on the ground. TSFFR gives you the most chances for a freeze effect.
---
500 pages so far
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power_armor_(Fallout_76)
---
It has to do with game mechanics,the game counts the power armor suit as a different entity, your gear is equipped but it doesnt count, and power armor has equal if not better benefits than regular armor,hidden damage and radiation reduction plus mods like emegency protocols that are very good, also the reduction bonuses count against everything unlike regular armor that it has to be vs players or ghouls etc.
---
The only thing that it doesnt make sense is poison resistance,how poison passes through a sealed suit is beyond me.
---
Ah cheers, that helps me decide, and ultra, what does that mean?
---
yes even if is a lie
---
776 pages please üòé
---
Ahhh,ok. Haven't done the Campfire Tales. Will keep an eye out for the event notifications. Thanks.
---
Currently I'm wearing the tattered dress (for that sweet, sweet 1 perception), the reclaimed seep minig mask and the shell shocked backpack. They call me the fashion master.
---
I‚Äôm not even halfway through Wastelanders
---
IMO, better will be just bigger budget.
---
there is a premade lootpool for each server, this is known for a long time now. it's the same for enemy loot, legendary vendor or crafting. if you get several bloodied items as loot, try to gamble at the purveyor or go crafting - you will have a higher chance to get bloodied then being on a server which drops frequently more other legendarys.
---
You get "free atoms" as a FO1st member? ü§£ü§£ You're paying for that shit ya goober
---
It going to be Epic!
---
Yup, I think this relates to the other post that someone made about wanting more sexy dresses in the Atom shop.
---
Add those dresses and there will be plenty of 'wood' to go around.
---
That'll show em.
---
Really wish they didnt remove the quest sharing feature though
---
I also have done it multiple times without dying but when I post my experience from one event today with only have 3 more guys with me that where levels 50, 60 and 90 I had same guy tell me to not die as much that told this poster same thing. So it‚Äôs tad annoying
---
In agreement. Batteries Included. I find that a 15 INT is almost a requirement for a PA, heavy weapon energy user.
---
Im still waiting for the legendary item to just spawn in my inventory. So when i die at the end of ACP I CAN ACTUALLY GET THE ITEMS I EARNED.
---
Nah, im paying for my scrap box and tent. Atoms are a bonus.
---
I hope so. I need a lot of edits, but it started as a short character guide, and ballooned from there.
---
Its just my shorthand for ultracite
---
You‚Äôre welcome. I made a post about it a while back when I first experienced it. I didn‚Äôt want anyone losing loot like I did multiple times before that night.
---
&gt;Showing the camp owners level next to the camp information would help with two things: - Setting the right expectations of what to find in the vending machines at the camp. - Allowing me to drop items at a low level player's camp.
---
Umm... It doesn't though. I've seen enough low levels with good stuff (likely mule accounts) &amp; high levels with either relative junk, gear mostly for low levels or terrible pricing to know that level has very little bearing to the quality of a vendor.
---
Thank you. I will have to try the one I got earlier as a drop from the Queen, it's not TS, but at least the FFR is there.
---
Hate running the Nuke silo only to get to the end and have a cool down timer on inputting the launch code
---
In my experience, this game has the most wholesome and friendly playerbase ever.
---
Heck, I'm still happy about launching my first nuke a month ago. Keep on Rocking!
---
You are a sick, sick man...I love it!
---
But surely they could eventually manage to get the code before the week ends, get into the silo (which they are allowed to do) fight off the robots and launch a nuke. With the system telling them they arent supposed to be doing this but we're not stopping you.
---
Yep. The issue was that the drum mag was exactly like having a quad effect. So they nerfed it to make a difference between the two.
---
Ah got ya
---
As if anyone is obligated to notify you. Rules are in the sidebar. If you read them you'd know why your post was removed.
---
glade they fixed the bug we had on jan 2019 where we had to wait days to be able nuking again.
---

---
lpt: being able to enter the silo means the silo is indeed ready - but your character has an seperate launch timer for each silo. this is what prevents you from using the launch platform, but since everyone else could use it the silo remains open.
---
God that would be so amazing! I remember buying a legendary module for the first time and thinking I could apply it to my .50 cal for a random effect, but I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôd love it if Bethesda could update the legendary modules to affect base game armour and weapons.
---
That was my biggest problem with the backstory: nothing mattered because every single human being in West Virginia was already dead.  A few (the raiders mostly but a few civies) fled the area and they/others have now come back.
---
Plus... it's been 7-8 years since the failure of Operation Touchdown and the local extinction of humans...and nothing much else happened?  The Scorchbeasts didn't spread, the Scorched plague didn't spread.  Everything stayed exactly the same for 7-8 years and then we showed up.
---
Monday.
---
Yes. Have you?
---
Mine is more of a checklist than a journal. I've listed locations categorized by area (Forest, Mire, etc) and I don't check the location off until I have thoroughly checked out the entire location. Also have checklists for recipes, quests, and PS4 trophies/progress tracker. 
---
In a perfect world, I would have it with me every time I play and I would check things off when I did them. Buuuut I kinda temporarily misplace the notebook fairly often so... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Edit:  if I had it on me every time I would also like to track cool spots I find, places I'd like to build my camp, etc
---
Exactly my point . But everyone on here jump real quick to " stop dying " . Very "helpful" also not what I was talking about . Idiots !
---
lol, because that‚Äôs TOTALLY comparable.
---
Considering that 5.56 is pretty common ammo, a standard magazine is 30 rounds.
---
Yep, using intRaw to get exact numbers on budget usage shows most lamps being worth two of most static objects (walls, furniture, decorations, etc).
---
Although it was needed, it ruined 2 legendary perks
---
They would give me a reason why on other subbreddits. This the only subredddit that doesn‚Äôt do that.
---
The fact that it was like that originally was literally an oversight. Somebody was copy-pasting from fo4 and forgot to adjust it to the rest of the settings. What about the pipe rifle drum mags? Combat shotgun drum mags? Assault rifle drum mags? All of them were adjusted to +50% of standard when the game launched. Using an oversight as an argument for intent doesn't work
---
It‚Äôs a visual glitch usually from when a merchant or your ally used it last, just look away and activate it again.
---
I would love if they had an option to make camps spooky
---
If it wasn't for Wasteleanders FO76 would have been dead, as in no more than 80-100 total players in a day. Maybe a bit more on console on a very good day. I don't think FO76 is a great Fallout game, but it is a good enough game after Wastelanders and *now* definitely worth the buy.
---
it only show up when you destroy the bunker lmao
---
Before meeting the people I group up with now, I didnt have many great weapons and my perk build was non existent. I was farming Whitespring ghouls (when we could) and found someone in Power armour next to a crippled ghoul. I shot it a couple of times before he told me to stop and let his friend come over and get a shot too. I joined his group and have been travelling with them since.
---
I was never expecting to find a big group of friends to play with on this game and if it wasnt for them I would never have been able to get to where I am now.
---
I have decided to start spreading this friendliness to other people in the game, giving weapons to new players, and occasionally giving them a nukashine for my own enjoyment XD
---
Hmm you‚Äôre right. I tested only with a single water. I need to examine a bulk sell.
---
Itll all be solved if they just A. Give you the settings option to consolidate all loot like ESO and B make all loot drops (minus player loot drops) have a beam of light to the sky like The Division. It really isn't that hard.
---
Again, no one is obligated to notify you about anything. Especially when you forego reading the rules and throw a fit over a post that violated them being removed.
---
Your request would be annoying af getting that prompt for each picture you take.
---
They do reference the rule number when they take down a post though. When I get notified of a comment on a removed post and I go to look, it says "deleted: rule x"
---
I love it.  I spend far too much time in Appalachia
---
Love that line from Bender
---
Not just COVID, but a hero from so much bullshit from politics from both sides on the current events. It really is an oasis from real life in 2020. Who'd think I'd ever say that a year ago about this game.
---
I'll have gotten my legendary, traveled to the Rusty Pick, sold it, got a new one, and am at the next event before it shows...If we're really asking Bethesda for something, like Santa Clause, how about we ask for VATS to work correctly.
---
Todd is everywhere, sometimes he does stuff.
---
Familiar enough to know that the president is the only person who can launch a nuke. Even then he had to meet with the highest ranking military officers and then they send a message to the launch crews and then they vote and if it goes through the missiles launch. It's a bit different a sub launches it tho.
---
Cool down timers *are* the game! /s
---
The chest has random amount of caps,it can give from 25 to 500,i mostly stay bellow but sometimes i try my luck.
---
Yeah.
---
I agree, I‚Äôm level 39, these players could‚Äôve wiped me out in a heart beat but instead showed a huge amount of generosity. I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say it made my day!
---
start of next month iirc
---
Thorn and Solar do that already.
---
On xbox you just go into your pip boy to see it,but yeah they should show everything not just legendaries.plans armor weapons recipes.
---
Same lol. Make sure there's none under the Stored tab either.
---
Lol
---
Use this to play around with the stats https://fed76.info/pricing/?item=None&amp;effects=None and it'll give you a rough idea of what you'll have to pay
---
Explosive does add on quite a bit of value tbh
---
Must. Nuke. Everything.
---
That's my plan at least.
---
Thanks for the responses all, I realise now I didn‚Äôt test with bulk selling my water where I may have seen a difference.
---
I never got that; so i didn‚Äôt break a rule. And they are just trying to silence people.
---
im hoping this to be true, thanks
---
"It just works".... *mostly for us. $$$*
---
You gotta assume in the game that MODUS is doing the heavy lifting too. In effect he tells you he has studied the system and requests you to complete xyz in order to launch it. 
---
During prewar, a rogue general would have to take the prez hostage without anyone else, or MODUS, finding out to get away with it, presumably of course.
---
Drop the Bomb on it!!! Before Its to late
---
Thanks, I'll check it out!
---
You aint got one, do ya?
---
Well I don't mean that it came through as a notice. I've never posted on here so haven't had one deleted. But when I'm commenting back and forth on someone else's post and it gets deleted, when I go back to see the last comment it will say deleted for whatever rule violation. Did anyone comment on your post that you'd be able to go and look at it to see if it lists the reason?
---
It‚Äôs almost like the game and players would benefit hugely from a companion app. Since we all keep our phone nearby it would be so convenient. Imagine being able to check your lists @ home or work or wherever. Oh well. We can only dream.
---
The President simply gives the order. He doesn‚Äôt type in launch codes or push a button. 
---
He *authenticates* his orders. He doesn‚Äôt have a ‚Äòmagic button‚Äô that launches anything.  That‚Äôs done by actual launch crews. 
---
There‚Äôs no ‚Äòvote‚Äô amongst any group to launch a nuke. I have no idea where you get that idea from. 
---
Finally, this is a fictional universe. It works the way the lore says it works.  End of story.
---
They haven‚Äôt said specifically, but sometime in September.
---
That is true. But *theoretically* a random general could do it. Which is not how it works irl.
---
I sold one yesterday for 50 caps in my camp... Was I desperate for caps: YES
---
Thank you it was my wife's idea for the toilet paper and bed w tv
---
M is for meat!
---
Jk that‚Äôs interesting
---
You are a lucky man
---
Then why does a random general have access to America's nuclear weapons? It makes no sense.
---
Drifter outfit, either with green hood, bandana and wrap around goggles or with black cowboy hat and sunglasses
---
Think it's already considered in use when a npc is moving towards it. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
about 20-30 times
---
It seemed like you were implying that no ES or Fallout games have been released since Skyrim, only more Skyrim editions.
---
I like the nuka cola quantum jumpsuit for my PA mechanic themed character.
---
But I also enjoy the pink Cosmos outfit with the chally head lol
---
Level 160 here, still haven't finished the main quest

u/Colonel_Cosmetic a 12 minutes video, for you both, of a recent Dev interview concerning the next 22 &amp;23 patches Worth a watch. ‚úå

It‚Äôs going to auto complete no matter what
---
Yes, Berry Mentats are your friend.
---
Stealth boy M3s are my friend. üòà
---
Not some random general. THE general
---
I mean a separate tab in personal inventory, Stash, and player vendor. On the map, armor includes clothing. There should be a separate list. I don't want to waste time looking for armor only to find everything is clothing.  
---
I have a fix for it and it would be so much better. The market would be better IMO.
---

---
According to the instructions given to you by MODUS only the misileers can launch the missiles. The robots engage in combat with anyone not with a registered misileer, presumably not only to prevent unauthorized access to launch the missiles but also to stop people from preventing a launch.
---
It works for me, although I use rank 3.
---
Bloodied unyielding plus Hard Bargain 3 means I get the maximum possible amount for selling items.
---
Maybe a light switch to turn on a mirror ball and jukebox for some nice light classical/jazz.
---
Imagine my surprise when I first got a hold of a full T-60 set and realized I had more carry capacity with my crafted armor then in PA.
---
I think every full PA set should give a flat +100 carry capacity, because you'd think a big POWERED ARMOR would let you carry more..
---
Or candles
---
Gold!!!
---
Yea happens all the time. Once it goes berserk you have to put it down by storing it and replacing it. Little off-topic advice; If you can easily move your camp, you can repair all your turrets automatically by moving your camp. These repairs might even work by storing it, haven't tried.
---
I mostly roll with the Mountain Scout, Campaign hat, and Patrolman sunglasses.
---
So in the fallout universe theres only one general?
---
Did you get it this time? Cuz your post has been deleted and it's very clear why ü§£ü§£
---
Run around and shoot at him at different angles and get him to chase you, he may eventually pops back up.
---
Im finding this to be quite frustrating.  Ran the event three times and the same issue on each attempt. Three wasted nuclear keycards, three failed attempts.  
---
*sets controller down, flips beth the bird, leaves*
---
that damage is insane
---
But if you had the correct stuff you can launch a nuke freely but if you are breaking in you can still launch it but we might try stop you?
---
Just tried it with 2 of my friends last night, pretty fun. We did it kinda late and on a whim.
---
Weren't really prepared so we didn't beat him, but got him down to about 25% when the timer ran out. 
---
Ran around killing all the wendigo spawns keeping them off the other 2 while they focused on Earle before running back over and joining in by jumping around punching him in the face.
---
I ended up running out of stimpaks, our heavy gunner broke all 3 of his guns with no repair kits, and my other friend just ran out of ammo I think.
---
Definitely try it again tonight, and actually prepare beforehand this time lol.
---
Go to queen fights and get improved repair kits  I have a couple hundred of them. Can‚Äôt remember last time I had to repair something at a bench
---
If it helps we came out of winter through COVID and it didn't change the scene much. It's funny we had less colds and flu's because people were more aware of transmission etc so the regular winter stuff didn't arrive.
---
Feel for ya bud. So many out of work with this bullshit plague.
---
Treasure hunter with black cowboy hat.
---
I have three tenderisers if anyone needs them. Happy to share, even modded a couple.

Look me up, IGN is Wild+Kat
---
I picked up the strangest thing, I got a red star pin from a liberator. Had it on display for a bit, but I put up curtains and now I wonder how many pink flamingos I need to scrap to display it again.
---
A random general *doesn‚Äôt* have access. They have to have a keycard and they have to have the current codes that change weekly.
---
You do realize that if a nuclear launch command crew all decided *‚Äòfuck it, we‚Äôre launching a nuke‚Äô,* they don‚Äôt need the President‚Äôs orders, right?  The reason that doesn‚Äôt happen is because they go through an extremely thorough screening process to make sure they are trustworthy and there is a serious amount of discipline and respect for the chain of command that goes into their training.  Add to that the threat of MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction), and that‚Äôs why it doesn‚Äôt happen in the real world. 
---
But in the fictional world of Fallout, especially when there isn‚Äôt a President around to give the orders, and there‚Äôs not a sapient launch crew to question any orders, and MODUS is actively *encouraging* the general to do so, and there‚Äôs virtually no chance of any retaliation?
---
Yeah, it fits into the lore. 
---
You‚Äôre overthinking it and trying to apply ‚Äòreal-world logic‚Äô (and yours has flaws to begin with, like a ‚Äòvote‚Äô) to a fictional universe where the original protocols may have been different and there aren‚Äôt any current checks and balances other than ‚Äòhave a keycard and the current codes‚Äô.
---
I always vote for the one on the left cuz I didn't mean to pull up the map to vote and I want it to go away.
---
I don‚Äôt know how small the rep drop is for keeping all the gold, but is it really so low that you can make it up faster than the 3 days it takes to earn the 500 gold you lose out on by not keeping it? Just curious.
---
Yes amazing look... also preety impossible to get lol
---
It's the ghosts of the people who died during the great war using it.
---
Along with all the foods. Double from lunchbox, triple from the event, 15% more from cranberry relish (or whatever cranberry food it was) that's a lot of xp.
---
Yes it gives it to you after you are spawned out of the mine
---
Indeed
---
***Newsflash:***  Fallout isn‚Äôt ‚Äòreal life‚Äô. It‚Äôs a fictional universe that has some similarities to the real world, but plenty of deviations. 
---
Being exposed to radiation doesn‚Äôt give you mutant powers in real life, either.
---
They marked that one as "CUT" in the game files, but they somehow forgot to actually remove it from the world. 
---
I know, I know... every slice of pie is technically "cut" one way or another, but this is just silly.
---
Does anyone know what helm and outfit that is?
---
You no longer lose your junk when you die at public events :)
---
I‚Äôm rocking the CSS with the Captain Cosmos bubble helmet. The helmet glows when the pipboy light is on and looks funky and cool.
---
Why do you ‚Äúneed‚Äù the luck for super duper. The standard is to run starched genes and bloody mess with every build. Why not just swap out bloody mess for super duper whenever you start crafting? Those points are probably better suited in strength, perception, intelligence, or agility for the build you are describing.
---
Are you being for real right now?
---
And if you boost your charisma to 8, you‚Äôll get an option to lie to Davenport and still get part of the caps reward when you turn in the quest. Not much, like 40 caps, but mitigates some of the fast travel costs for the day.
---
Space suit with tattered mole helmet
---
An article I found said that the launch crew vote by turning their keys at the same time. I'm not the president of the united fucking states. I dont even live in america.
---
I know about that, that‚Äôs my goal
---
Well is there?
---
Oh, ***please link that article***. I am very eager to read this resource.
---
Thanks for the tip! Honestly I‚Äôm a pretty casual player even though I‚Äôm level 120 and haven‚Äôt really sought out tips.
---
Edit: also I was unclear I have 3 luck total. I don‚Äôt equip super duper in fights
---
I used the C.A.M.P to destroy the C.A.M.P.
---
I show up and complete workshop defense even if the owner isn‚Äôt around. I don‚Äôt want your workshop, just the XP, loot and daily/weekly events complete.
---
I usually wear a space suit with eyebot helmet and Mr. Pebbles Space Explorer backpack
---
I‚Äôm on PS4, but I‚Äôm glad to hear that this is becoming somewhat of a custom for us low levels to show our appreciation.
---
I've never had it happen and I'm good for a bit but I did start to panic when it loaded me into a nuked world a second time. I just didn't want to use rad away and lose my mutations.
---
I never stopped either. I feel fuckin drained to be honest. I wouldn't even call my job essential but apparently the Government did. 
---
And likewise we had our first baby too- it's a wakeup call for me as I was so used to putting in massive game hours and now that the baby wigs out and I find myself AFK'ing heaps (not intentionally during events though...).
---
That's great!   Thanks for lmk.
---
Activation station several times work too.
---
I'm level 70 and I don't like glitchs and believe in doing it honestly i once had a level 1000 probably how he got that level
---
There's more structure in WV than the real world.
---
Run a Colossal Problem and when the boss is dead dont run out the mine just stay and farm the Wendigos for their screws.
---
Swift mag is good for lowering AP cost
---
Why are you dying so much and so quick? Are you a bloody build? Ive ran this event on every character, some of which are just roleplay characters and haven't died that much even with my bloody builds.
---
I found a perfectly preserved pie in a vendor for 99 caps yesterday. I snapped it up for my next encounter with a generous player.
---
At least they combined it with fasnacht and the masks but I‚Äôm with you.
---
Based on everything you've said I would say bloody mess is the perk you'd be wanting, extra damage is always good.
---
Looks to me like windows with shutters because there's also some on the dark side of the little picture
---
Good idea but they probably want it accessible to low level players and dont want the event nuked.
---
Is there anyway you can post a screen cap if your build? Sounds like you are trying to maximize two very different builds when you need to focus on one or the other. If you want to run heavies you need strength and intelligence. If you want to run rifles you need perception and agility. Trying to make both builds viable on a single character is not super easy. I would suggest suggest either going all in on heavy weapons and running melee as a alternative or going all in on commando and running rifleman as your alternative.
---
Strangler for nuke zones and T65 for other areas and Excavator for lucky holes.
---
As well as being able to reroll legendary bonuses or be able to craft legendary bonuses onto existing equipment for an appropriate cost.  So we could modify existing non-legendary equipment or 1 star and 2 star legendary equipment into 3 stars equipment with enough legendary modules.  Legendary bonuses would require additional rare materials to craft like flux.  If we are able to craft the items we want instead of relying on the RNG gods, then duping will become pointless since everyone could have the equipment they want with enough effort.  Any legendary modified equipment might have to be bound to the character or account like the Bullion equipment.
---
Thank you.
---
I have 1,000 scrip and about 300 in the stash ready for the purveyor sale. Let‚Äôs see what I get lol
---
I put my camp next to fort defiance for ease of scrapping then one day I did a nuked line in the sand. That was the end of my camp.
---
Dont worry about it. I see people glitching it all the time. I repair the generator and there's always 1 or 2 mouth breathers that want to exploit and bitch me out. I just want to get in finish it and get my rewards. I tell them if they want to glitch public events they can go to private.
---
This video is worth watching if you‚Äôre looking to understand what makes something magic - https://youtu.be/9mRX-MEPzhs
---
I sense much big brain in you Lol
---
The only part that doesn't make sense to me is the first bit where we have to fabricate a new biometric ID. Surely this would only have to be done once? But for some reason, it's required for every silo run, even though we technically should be able to use our biometric ID from last time. It's not like the machine eats it or anything, unlike the nuclear keycard at the end.
---
There are multiple generals. There is only one *commanding general*. 
---
Just like there can be multiple officers in a unit, but only one is the *commanding officer*.
---
I‚Äôm guessing that you don‚Äôt have much experience with military organizations, is that correct?
---
Some people take the game way too seriously.  You should have kept repairing the turret after his outburst lol
---
I repair it every time. Fuck ‚Äòem I‚Äôm not gonna change how I play the game so they can exploit. I don‚Äôt care if they do or don‚Äôt, but if they don‚Äôt get on the mic and politely ask me not to then I‚Äôll do what I want. They could always pay for a private server if they wanted to exploit freely.
---
Lode Baring has an annoying bug that makes Melody Larkin bitch about the Church every time you log in for weeks when triggered. Happened to me too many times so I stopped doing it.
---
Mainly in PA all the time, really love the junkyard legs and head, t65 torso and arms. Gives me a walking tank vibe :)
---
I don't want to play a team game. It says so when I recommend solo mode. You should be better at being more intelligent.
---
Ok
---
- Mountain scout outfit
---
- reclaimed mining helmet (ACP reward)
---
- blue ridge backpack
---
Sea wookies. :)
---
Hunters Long Coat with the Veil of Mysteries and a Black Prospect Hat
---
This is a valid point. Once for each solo would be sufficient. 
---
Granted it takes less than a minute or so if you move quickly, but that‚Äôs beside the point.
---
First thing that came to mind was the song from [This is the Ultimate Showdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WgT9gy4zQA)
---
I don't even know what 250 SCORE is. I just want a competitive pvp mode and currently it isn't competitive UNLESS you have experienced friends in your friends list.

I once saw Paige checking vendors, another time Preston Garvey was following me yelling,"come back here General,there is a settlement that needs our help."

I‚Äôm 15,9,3,10,9,3

Edit: I do keep the 9 perception to be competent with a rifle, i run mostly melee in solo but sometimes a silenced rifle is needed
---
see what the camera shows you
---
Well then choose the 3* ranged weapon one then. Theres one for melee and one for ranged. Both cost the same scrip.
---
Maybe it's a Nerf Drum mag, those hold like 20-30 darts in a drum mag.
---
Haven't seen it, but no, it probably shouldn't disappear.
---
Also hit Hemlock Holes for Acid. If no one has claimed the workshop, you can farm 4 Acid Wells plus 2 Snallygasters and 1 Grafton Monster.

Fed76 is the only place I know of that even attempts to price things but everyone says it's unreliable. I think it's a good starting point though.

---
Flatwoods was the only map for many many months. People got tired of it and then only voted Morgantown.  
---
Another is that Flatwoods has less terminals, and also less orange crates, and it doesn't have a static spawn location for the briefcase.
---
So this is a witch-hunting post?
---
Downvote this all you want, OP offered no proof that the player he accuses of exploiting to gain levels actually did so. This post is a pretty sad attempt at a witch-hunt because OP got butthurt over someone else on the internet calling him a name. Level 500 players are no longer rare and most are more than likely legit. Just because you are only level 70 doesn‚Äôt mean that all other players are using exploits to be higher level than you. Pump up your intelligence, buy a set of Unyielding, and cook some relish if you want to see how players get to be higher level, or just put time into the game like many of us have since BETA.
---
I love you. You damned beautiful Mutie.
---
It‚Äôs beautiful- 33 to 1 return
---
Thank you! And lucky holes?
---
Mr. Fuzzy outfit right now until I can get my hands on the responders outfit.  I got the helmet but no luck on the outfit.
---
I really like this. In general I am all for clearing out existing buildings for NPCs. Grahm and Chally in particular could do with a static place to either start or end their travels at.
---
Plus, on the trading subs you can do a "price check" post to get feedback from the community, if you're so inclined.
---
As long as you have the work called ‚Äústarched genes 2‚Äù under luck. You can take as many rad away or rad away diluted and it will never delete your mutations.
---
Not Shadynasty!!! I mourn for your loss.
---
I carry stealth boys also and I let them see I don‚Äôt have chameleon go behind something use the stealth boy and they never see me coming
---
How do people shoot the Gauss Shotgun as fast as the Combat Shotgun? This is some hack because you cannot do it by pressing the mouse button fast..
---
&gt;Being exposed to radiation doesn‚Äôt give you mutant powers in real life, either.
---
Thanks for crushing my dreams bro. I couldnt wait to jump 3 metres in the air.
---
I had one and I think I ate it.
---
Yes that is quite correct.
---
Damn!buy a lottery ticket
---
So if you understand that part of the game isn‚Äôt identical to reality, why are you having an issue with *this* part of the game?
---
I haven‚Äôt even been able to loot them during or after the event...
---
So I see this still hasn't been fixed and the last comment is that "its being worked on with no expected timeframe". Great.
---
Elder's Battlecoat, with Field Scribe Hat and Plaguedoctors Mask. I have rocked that since I got them. But having gotten the reclaimed miner helmet... I might have to switch it up.
---
Everyone needs to protest at Bethesda in person to get anything done. Maybe do a chaz/chop type thing where we take the place over and force the developers to start working.  
---
With that said, the key to wait times is reducing the match size to something like 26 max. Then, reduce the map radius to something like 50%. Then you will get matches always in less than 1 minute.
---
Just give it a few days
---
Yo! I‚Äôm assuming chameleon and life saving would go into pool 3? 
---
Just got life saving in public game.
---
Switched to private server
---
Got chameleon in private server
---
2x for each arm.
---
Is this game really that dead??
---
Perhaps but at least now I know why sometimes the event works roughly the way I suspect it is supposed to and other times dozens of scorched teleport into midair roughly 10' above the sonic generator and drop on it.
---
I was using the green hood and bandana with the mothman glasses for a while.
---
Same, I saved him and Beck gave me both dialogue options for him being dead and alive.
---
I'm sorry to hear that, some people are just arrogant. I actually prefer it off but only because it makes my game lag and the scorchbeast seems to not ever land which is a problem because I run melee
---
Nice, I‚Äôd love to get those.
---
Also a big fan of insurgent with the faustnacht beret and sunglasses
---
Ahh, I so agree with this! I bought the stars and stripes dress in the atom shop recently and it looks so rubbish. I'd love the pink and green laundered dresses from FO4 or maybe something a little retro, bouncy and polka dot to suit the vintage themes. I'd also love if the longer dresses didn't glitch and get stuck up my character's arse all the time, showing her knickers off to the world.
---
Because i recently did it and it didnt make sense to me. Now after having my ass smacked I understand its fallout and who cares.
---
tree fiddy.
---
The Schr√∂dinger's brother
---
Try the red ski hat, it gives me the division vibes
---
The reason I don‚Äôt loot wendigo spawns anymore is because they don‚Äôt drop ammo anymore they used to drop it all the time now they just drop screws n stuff
---
Me too. He must b thinking. Did I have a loose one out there?
---
I disagree.
---
As someone who is always broke, 1700 is a decent amount of caps. Especially considering the max you can get from bot vendors per day is only 1400. So in my case, I'd only be able to run the event once every 2 days.
---
They're atom shop, hopefully back soon.
---
Buying from the purveyor is basically gambling.
---
"He's just standing there and using the wave emote... menacingly!
---
The only reason the player has access is because of help from MODUS and there is a lack of multiple levels of checks and balances that would have existed pre-war
---
No idea. I just got one shot by a combat shotgun and didn‚Äôt think that was possible. Marine armor and full health.....
---
The goo n ash pile has been a problem in the game. Especially when U see heavies turn up during Line in the Sand. Its a shit mess to loot proper
---
Idk you but I really enjoyed it. As a player that ended all the main and side quests I lack of smnting  that is entertaining beyond the point of nuking everywhere but the score event it really brings again the feeling of do things again and it really is a plus.
---
By the way ,when it ends? :)
---
I was thinking the other day, what if they brought the Survival servers back, and flipped how workshops behaved in them. Like, that was the only NON-PVP location in the game. Leave them the same as they are with resource nodes, building, etc. - but you can't claim them just for yourself or lock anything, everything done there is public and no one can be killed there. Turn them into a 'hub' for people to use to build defense structures for their camps, essentially give the building crowd what they've been asking for Forever, access to a huge sandbox to build in(within reason like no persistent structures longer than 30 minutes.)
---
I think it would be sort of funny and ironic, to build a sandbox within a PVP based world. But, allow you to blueprint your builds for use in Adventure Mode &amp; NW; however - your builds are completely destructible in the Survival Mode.
---
I had a dead mongrel show up in the middle of my living room the other day, I don‚Äôt have any allies that could‚Äôve taken it out without me knowing. Some ~spoooky~ stuff afoot in the wasteland
---
lol yeah Lucky Hole Mine is where you get the lead ores, excavator doubles the yields as long as you have both arms equipped.
---
I sold all my 3* last nite to the raider vendor... see who gets to buy them at lower price for scrip
---
It somewhat makes sense for it to be where it is.
---
President Eckhart released the Scorchbeasts in 2086 and the Free States capital of Harper's Ferry fell to the Scorched that same year.  The majority of the BOS died in Operation Touchdown Jan 29th 2095, Fort Defiance fell Aug 18th 2095.  Morgantown Airport, last stronghold of the Responders fell Nov 7th 2096 and the last of the Raiders and a few remaining civilians fled the state in the Spring of 2097.
---
Poor Graham hadn't seen a human being for almost seven years by the time Vault 76 opened on Oct 23rd 2102.  He was probably delighted to see us.
---
I hope everyone realizes that the glitch doesn‚Äôt depend on the ASAM turret being broken, it‚Äôs simply a common curtesy to leave it broken so frame rates don‚Äôt take a massive hit. Most high level players deal with extreme amounts of lag(specifically on consoles) due to the nature of the games code. ASAM fire wrecks frame rate to the point where I physically turn my camera away from it just so my game doesn‚Äôt completely freeze. If you are doing the event solo as a lower level player, maybe you need the turret, but if you are in an event with multiple higher levels any one of them will more than likely out-damage the ASAM with a single shot.
---
Including the random nuclear keycards they throw at you.
---
Lucky U. Now dup that weapon n sell! Lolz
---
I wasn‚Äôt real impressed or use a lot of the rewards but I actually didn‚Äôt mind the grind and found it kind of fun.  Looking forward to the next run.
---
I rolled a b2525
---
I think maybe 2 weeks if that.  I finished it maybe 3 weeks ago I really miss my lunch boxes. Yeah it brought out more to do which I was definitely craving.  But the fact ACP had been on PTS for while then it was broken on release killed me
---
It's more that the majority of players don't want to dip outside of Adventure Mode. PVP interested players are outliers.
---
Dont get me wrong I loved the wallpapers but most were disappointing
---
the part missing is a dust cover.  it does really need to be there but i think they just tried to make it look cool.
---
What platform you on, I might have 13000 shells for ya
---
I like this exploit a little bit, you can get like 10 levels from each line in the sand, im sure most people know of it
---
I am fairly sure it is basically a cover to keep things from interfering with the recoil spring. 
---
Bethesda logic would make me think that in the main game it helps cool the gun in automatic, and in nuclear winter they leave it on...because it is winter and so colder ;)
---
I‚Äôm on PS4
---
AA (HP20%) vs B (HP20%) ?
---
Let me know if it was enabled and if disabling worked for you
---
Me too bro....me too i couldn't even get the holotape for the misc quest lol
---
Ah cheers. At least I know what to use, as T-65 is gonna take me awhile to get so is strangler best to use before I get it?
---
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxtVRqFhHcQ) has an interesting answer for you. Apparently, there's some answers from Modus to this question, to quickly summarize, if the 'general' is gone, then the line of sucession would come into play, so that would introduce how 'any' old general would do to launch the nuke. 
---
He has [some further videos on his channel that examine the Enclave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGEJXyQbpZw) and other lore elements of FO76 a bit further, check 'em out.
---
Yah I know what you mean, I wasn‚Äôt very impressed with the loot either.  I actually find the dailies kinda fun though (minus the bobblehead) lol. It seems I can only find them when there isn‚Äôt a daily for them haha
---
How about legendary items and event/quest rewards are shown to the side instead of IN MY FACE WHEN I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A DAMN FIREFIGHT?!
---
Do you love bunnies? 
---
Because the one they added on the atom shop loves you!
---
The description made me laugh. 
---
I think that‚Äôs Bethesda‚Äôs attempt to be ‚Äògirlie‚Äô.
---
I feel like Bethesda‚Äôs merchandising people are asleep at the wheel, considering all the plushies they have in-game and the mid-century modern throwback clothing and furnishings they‚Äôve included I would think eventually they‚Äôll launch a clothing line or a line of plushies or maybe team up with IKEA or something. Maybe they‚Äôre waiting for the Fallout TV series to do it. . .
---
You seem to care. You seem to care that it isn‚Äôt identical to your expectations, which are based on flawed information from some random article you read. 
---
And I have no idea why.
---
You mean with all of the crucial, major decision making dialog that brought real choice to the game?
---
That one?
---
They never really designed this game to quest with your friends, which is a real shame.
---
If I‚Äôm in a group with my friend and we both have the same story quest then it should advance for both of us as we complete tasks instead of I do it and then he has to do it too. Especially if it‚Äôs an instanced area. Doing everything twice gets dull very fast.
---
It is not a glitch, it happens to everyone
---
Honestly although T65 has the highest numbers, they are all very viable especially if you have Emergency Protocols on the torso. X01 T51 SH etc all should suit you well. I don‚Äôt feel much difference among them except T51b noticeably requires more radaways in nuke zones.
---
 "**\[Luck 2+\]** I bet your name is... Davey? Davey, you said you were going to help me kill this one, right?"
---
Well, I am looking forward to the break between the current season and the next one so i can maybe slack off playing just a bit ;)
---
And with World of Warcraft Shadowlands launching in about seven weeks and Cyberpunk 2077 launching about three weeks after that, I don't really expect to be back for Season 2 in any event :(
---
Just look on nexus, I am using a mod that removes the ring. Also changed mine to black :)
---
"May have been the losing side. Still not convinced it was the wrong one."
---
Toxic
---
Same here. They always seem to die in the danger/kill zones, and are too dangerous to loot. So I don't bother.
---
The event costs me ammo, rather than the opposite.
---
You could pick up a set of power armor and a junkie heavy gun. Apart from stabilized you don't need any other damage perks since the heavy gunner damage perks aren't that effective on the PTS to be important. You can do them in normal legendary gear but with power armor they're really easy.
---
I know what you mean on the bobbleheads
---
And for a new player (started when the game was released on Game Pass which was basically the same time the Season started) the caps, card packs, etc. were very useful.
---
I'm thinking I may try to get my ol lady into WoW before shadowlands lol.
---
I have been doing that. The only ranged weapons I've ever got us pipe pistols and fatmans. Neither of which I use. Just bad rng
---
They didn‚Äôt make Earle harder to kill so why all the salt lol
---
I liked the wallpapers and the plushie.  The rest...not so much :(
---
Hes just spitting facts tho
---
No, we don't.
---
They aren't going to let it fail.  They'll just complete it themselves.  They can't afford for it to seem like the playerbase isn't there.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs a very low chance of them all dropping at the same time for the uranium fever event
---
Ah thank you for explaining it to me
---
Still having this issue almost a month later
---
Yawn.
---
Haha I‚Äôve just been craving to build a little and my current spots to uneven to build. That‚Äôs definitely a valid fear tho
---
Np and good luck!
---
You‚Äôre a lucky person who got a very rare drop after an event. Congrats!!!
---
Oh that makes sense
---
So you are saying this is legit then
---
Good idea
---
Happening to everyone doesnt make it not a glitch/bug.
---
Yeah but I don't see me finishing in two weeks I'm level 78 :8
---
It is still not a glitch, they just dont put enough effort into the dialogue
---
are you telling me that when you were low level you didn't turn up to an event you were underleveled for?
---
What situations do you see as needing a rifle? I would say drop them altogether and use a plasma caster of harpoon gun for ranged engagements.
---
4.20
---
Ha! I‚Äôm crafting fixers and handing them out in the Santa outfit today. 
---
It‚Äôs honestly the hardest endgame. People keep running away from me.
---
I thought Earl and wendigo/Ghouls in general didn‚Äôt take rad dmg
---
Says the level 51 player and his friend the level 52 player who just dropped their first nuke and doesn‚Äôt know to scan or set up the event ahead of time
---
This is a rare drop from events such as Uranium Fever and other Savage Divide events.
---
If you aren‚Äôt aware of doing anything illegitimate, then yes, it would have to be legitimate.
---
I'm not sure but I know that the dust covers are always missing. The foregrip/handguard peice typically has un upper peice to cover the tube that encompasses the piston and its missing as well. The one thing I always wondered is why is the handmade  an ak variant. I know for a fact building an Ar is easier than an Ak. I did have an 80% lower and a jig but the ak requires a press although with a welder some steel and a bottle jack one could be made very easily I suppose.
---
Word that makes me happy because I am on Xbox so no cheating here just never seen 4 rare items just appear
---
This!!! I craft, run up to the scrap machine, find it,  what it is, scrap it, and run back down to craft again.
---
I just use a regular heavy weapons build and do well
---
On pc and it‚Äôs happened to me randomly, just out and about and only on my .50 bolt action so far. The bolt action limits it to one shot and the unsuppressed .50 scares the shit out of me.
---
Did you test it or did it just say it had no resistance
---
It‚Äôs been asked infrequently around here but comes up, and there‚Äôs a large majority of people who have hopes they do allow this to happen!
---
Game when you're safe at home crafting: please go into your inventory to view the 1\* Stalkers Gauntlet you made
---
Game as it spawns 20 enemies when the SBQ dies: HEY THIS 2\* BORADSIDER IS SO AWESOME IT'S GOING TO TAKE UP YOUR ENTIRE SCREEN FOR 5 SENCONDS...WOOOO
---
I haven‚Äôt tested it yet, cause I don‚Äôt have any radiation weapons in my inventory just yet. I was posting this to see if anyone else has tried before I grid away trying to get one. lol
---
Finally some common sense.Thank you !
---
Then start selling some more stuff at your vendor. I haven‚Äôt been much lower than 20k caps since i started selling serums and weapons/armor at scrip prices.
---
Wendigos are immune to rad damage so I imagine the colossus would be the same.
---
Though, feel free to test that out.
---
I‚Äôve tried it with a FFR bloodied radium. Still quite a bit less damage than my vats crit handmade. 
---
The radium rifle needs more love (humans?) for sure.
---
I ran out once , saw the garbage in that chest, and stayed to kill wendigo ever since.
---
Just test w a standard gamma gun and see, if they don‚Äôt have rad resistance it‚Äôll be obvious pretty quick. It‚Äôs probably just a visual bug with the perk though
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing, and do well enough to be a solid addition to the battle, but I‚Äôm just wondering about a better build option.
---
Not me but the weapon is usually lame.
---
My classic....vault Tec pajamas and sunglasses
---
Could my rifle work with power armor in this situation?
---
That is epic
---
Nooooo ;-;
---
Was going to try that when I get to pay again later tonight. Just thinking and strategizing while working in my gallery. lol.
---
Will do
---
The upcoming damage changes should go a long way to sorting this issue out without having to touch stealth. I'd wait and see if you feel the same once that change drops.
---
I assume it's because it highlights Morgantown by default and people just want to get their vote out of the way(incumbents tend to win). The remainder are idle, or the few that don't want the same map for the 50th time in a row.
---
Yes I heard the tales of the scout mask and all kinds of good stuff dropping at once at the enclave savage divide you hit the lottery in the game world I‚Äôm still hitting that event every chance I get
---
Same, and all those loose screws
---
I don‚Äôt know what your nonsensical babbling is about. My husband and I are level 130.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen visuals of items in vendors in ages
---
I‚Äôm just hoping I don‚Äôt see single digits when I‚Äôm shooting any enemy
---
I'd be ok with this if I didnt craft them in bulk each time, i dont want to have to close a screen every time  if I make like 5. Maybe mark it as new until you look at it
---
Wish they offering clandestine paint for armor, even in the atom shop. Really give me shadowed armor much more of an ‚Äúoutfit‚Äù feel
---
Full set gives you +100 carry. Excav torso gives you the mining boost.
---
I have an excav torso on a set of t60 modded out for rads. It's my mining/flux pa.
---
It felt like this just buying purveyor items. You'd get like 4 of the same prefix in a row so if it was a good one you wanted to buy a bunch right then.
---
On Steam there is no bundle, 4000 atoms are 40 bucks.
---
Yeah, I was super excited to get a quad many months ago, but it just sat around in my stash box, cause I couldn‚Äôt figure out a decent use for it. It seemed like the weaker weapon in every instance.
---
I wore the Nuka Girl outfit on my main since the first time it was in the shop until about a month ago. Went back to the ratty skirt bc I think the Nuka Girl outfit is funny for the space lady companion. My secondary has the big ol bobble head and the grungy Nuka outfit; she‚Äôs got a two shot explosive handmade so she‚Äôs my little raider. Third has the clean Brahmin outfit and she‚Äôs all bloodied sneak so it cracks me up. The second two fit my perceived personalities for them, but I have a stupid fancy house on my main. She‚Äôs got big guns and no fear. I want this fancy bitch in a fancy dress with all of her Whitesprings furniture! Maybe something steampunk or an opera getup? I‚Äôm with you. Bigger problems, for sure, but we gotta have our fun with it. ü§™
---
I thought so too, maybe the ‚Äúawareness‚Äù perk card was being buggy.
---
Mostly because I run a melee build and don‚Äôt want to respec to take a ranged shot, again this plays to my casual nature of play, no interest in farming heavy weapon ammo beyond what I need for bosses so solid/melee and mediocre rifles work for 95 percent of encounters
---
I have 700 of em now! It‚Äôs insane!
---
The 2* are just as good (bc the 3rd * is usually crap) and half price, so instead of 100 for 1 3*, go for 2 2* for the same price
---
wow nice!!
---
Scavenger Outfit and Skinned Raider Hood and a Forest Scout Mask
---
True. But he also likes meat. wouldn‚Äôt it be fun if grahm told us go to meat house, and clear unfriendly mutants?
---
You'll go through double the amount of ammo you'd use usually but if that's not a problem then you'll be fine. You'll probably still break even with the ammo drops from enemies. Being in a group with others makes it a lot better too.
---
Finally a helpful comment.
---
No, you shouldn't. It's a selfish dick move to anyone NOT with you at the event.
---
If all of the team is at the event, sure, go for it. Otherwise, no.
---
He‚Äôs got a 10% chance to spawn in the grove when nuked. The question is why no one checks it when nuking fissure site prime. I‚Äôm consistently the only one running in to check if he‚Äôs spawns.
---
It is, yet it took me over a year to learn all the mods.
---
It should be the most powerful weapon in game.
---
In reality the dust cover is a pretty flimsy piece of metal. Once it's damaged it itself can interfere with the action. To avoid this they just usually remove the whole dust cover.( As a gun nut) it bugs me to no end.
---
At the beggining there were more options than you can find currently in the game. There were the cream, pink, rose and blue laundered dresses, the sequin one and the (magnificent) poodle skirt. A year later, they gave for free the green clean dress. None of them has ever returned to the ATX (or, if any of them had, briefly as 'in a day' and never ever came back again).
---
Some of us hold our last atoms in the hopes they come back, specially the poodle skirt one as it had a unique look, new for FO76... I guess we'll never get to spend those atoms.  
---

---
Especially the bloodied version! Such an odd choice to make it so rare and yet so weak.
---
Happens to me all the time on pc, It happens when I am aiming and shooting, get scared and when I aim again the shooting starts, but all you need to do is to repress your fire trigger to correct the issue. I use a vampire‚Äôs .50 cal so I‚Äôm almost always unloading fully automatic fire ibto his face but it might be a good idea to stop shooting when he starts the scream windup (he‚Äôll start crouching really low, that‚Äôs your cue) hopefully this can get addressed soon.
---
Thank you, this is great. And yes I will obviously use this as a starting point so I get the idea ty again :)
---
I try to help the humans when I can:)
---
Yeah, for me I think it goes back to when they were trying to patch the vendor dupe or maybe back when they made it so that the item description actually said how many stars and what the legendary effects are. Before that, you would have to actually inspect the item to see all it‚Äôs legendary effects.
---
Me neither.
---
I'm using T-60 because it's cheap and I have all the mods that suit my build. It's weaker than the X-01 an Ultracite but until I get the right mods for either of those, I'm pretty happy with the T-60. Not really feeling the deficit.
---
I really though there was a large amount of players that were interested in PvP and then there are player like me that just want the added dynamic of other players.
---
Oh what'd I'd do for a knee high sock and short/skirt combo.....
---
I got all at same time in Uranium Fever too other day
---
Anything above t-45 is pretty much the same except for radiation resistance since the DR/ER softcap is 350. I use the emergency protocols on t-60 because I like the BOS paint. If you've got grounded and scaly skin you could any power armor with almost no difference.
---
I sell every legendary I get at the rusty pick...maybe I shouldn‚Äôt do that so carelessly
---
The hero we didn't deserve.
---
Fed76 is a poor resource. The dev openly admits to biasing prices by ignoring all in-game pricing. There are so many veteran players I know (myself included) that consider it a joke because the prices are usually ludicrously high.
---
Oh no! He bought the Communist Bundle!
---
I don‚Äôt have some of these cards. What‚Äôs the best way to acquire them past level 50?
---
You do realize you‚Äôre mad at the lower level players for doing the exact same thing you and your husband were doing....waiting on heavy hitters to come bail you out
---
Yah me too
---
I know I've been out of the game for a while (still love seeing your builds though), but every time I see a post mentioning Earl, my mind immediately goes to Crazy Earl in the Borderlands series.
---
"Whatchu want?"
---
I‚Äôm on ps4
---
I mostly wear the Roadtrippers Outfit because it's the only one I really like besides the Laundered Dresses.
---
Chems sell well to vendors, also cooked meat, cook every meat you find, you can gather alot of glowing meat during uranium fever for example and sell 11c per one cooked max, also glowing blood selling 8c max. You can also clear Harper's ferry and sell gun drops to vendor bot located there, or line in the sand and walk to watoga (or blue ridge caravan).
---
I feel like all the characters look like cracked out, cocaine junkies
---
You got the jackpot drop from a event. Super rare, like 1 our of 10,000 or something crazy. They always drop in a set like that and each item is worth like 20k+ caps.
---
Ah right I can definitely see that.  Are we able to give people repair kits etc?  I have a ton and I don‚Äôt really use them..
---
I have respec'd a few times. Just saving up levels then getting the cards and moving the points all at once. If you got search online for nukes and dragons, it will show you the output from each card type and values from the special stats. Just keep opening perk card packs and eventually you will hve every card there is.
---
Yes. You hit the lottery.
---
You'd think with the emphasis on 50's futurism and war-standing militarism, there'd be more dress/skirt-suit outfits.
---
I mean, how much exp could they possibly lose in minute and a half?
---
I do this right before tapping the workshop and shooting them. ü§™üòà
---
I run X-01 with Calibrated Shocks on the legs (a must have), Motion Assist for the Torso (though many other options are superior, I just like the extra 10 lbs.), arms are not modded (all the mods add a little unarmed damage but nowhere near actual unarmed weapons or something else that's also largely a waste of CND, if any mod was useful I'd love to run it but none are to my knowledge), lastly I like the VATS head mod though the +Int. mod is likely superior.
---
As for T-65, I use it when doing Nukes, ACP, Encrypted, or Project Paradise, basically whenever I need more Armor than X-01. However I prefer the look of the X-01 with Nukashine paint so it's my general use armor. Also or some reason T-65 doesn't have the VATS head mod.
---

---
If the prizes were a bit better I'd like it.
---
So much filler between the ghillie and atomic onslaught paints.  Yuck
---
The respawn bug is a thing. That's the only reason a player wouldn't rejoin.
---
I saw a post where 4 people killed him in 16-18 seconds.
---
Nah, it'll be fine. If it's necessary, Bethesda will just move the goal posts to guarantee success like they did with concrete, though I don't think it'll come to that.
---
I haven't seen visuals of items in vendors for ages now. Can't remember the last time I actually saw it. I'm on PC.
---
I‚Äôm 3 mole rat teeth away from the 3rd blade. Been farming them from huntersville but I‚Äôm encountering the same low damage problem there now too. It‚Äôs like the game flips upside down on me lol
---
üôèüôèüôèüôè
---
Your ideas are intriguing to me, and I would like to subscribe to your newsletter.
---
What's wrong with a drum mag holding so much?
---
you could have a steam train
---
Bethesda fucking sucks. Start a new character and try again. It's one of only 2 ways to get it to work.
---
There's a whole section of the map where I don't usually visit or ck player camps. As you level you begin settling further away from Vault 76 until, like me, you either settle in Whitesprings or the Mountains, lol.
---
who runs packing light lol
---
It just works... *creepy Todd smile*
---
Over 2500+ hours in since BETA.
---
Friends make the game bearable when it‚Äôs struggling.
---
He and I completed another one with just one other player, who was comparable to us. 
---
Again, nonsensical babbling.
---
I only have a couple and haven't tried to give them away :(
---
Damn sounds like i missed out on a lot, guess its time to catch up, thanks for the info?
---
Changing servers and time may change which pool you are getting if we're right. So you would have to roll all in small time window.
---
I'm sick of the random item generation. No I don't want a magical shovel.
---
Oh damn thats good to know. You learn something new each day.
---
Ok but how is it "known" for a long time now? Sources? I'd wager it's all be speculation and even now is, only were putting a theory to the test now.
---
I expect the reason is simply that, from a code perspective, the survival tent is just a camp and the code treats it like one :(
---
.02% drop rate
---
.02% drop rate, masks are worth legacy weapons. dont sell em for caps.
---
I‚Äôd like some 1950s dresses with Peter Pan collars. Ughhh id love that very much
---
It has a "small player base" because it's nowhere near the same thing as survival mode and it's not what the majority of us PvPers wanted.
---
I got the outfit on my first time with no supplies
---
Yep, been playing since launch and it, always something crappie, never really anything worth while.
---
A dude complaining about dresses in a videogame... The future is strange sometimes
---
But its not rejoining, they never were in the instance at all as far as I can tell.  Is that still the respawn bug?  Does it prevent people from joining at the start?
---
I‚Äôm selling challys backpack for 2500. No ones bought it.
---
2000 hrs and never seen a BE handmade.
---
Finally got a bloodied fixer from the purveyor, if you‚Äôre not a cheater, it‚Äôs worth more than caps.

I think that op is here referring to the two key system that makes it physically impossible for one single individual to launch the missile on their own.
---
The idea being that ideally it should be extremely difficult to get a man inside the silo at all, let alone two.  Thereby preventing simple subterfuge, as it would require the cooperation of multiple individuals raising the risk of capture and difficulty of launching a missile unauthorized.
---
It's not quite a vote, but the language used may have referred to it as such maybe.
---
I felt like I had to upvote this post as that's what I wear too ;)
---
The instance is limited to 8 players each. Theoretically, if you saw 7 other players join with you, it should've put all of you in the same lobby.
---
Thanks, will be fixed in the next patch (c)
---
Guys i request if your gonna thumbs it up leave a comment please?
---
I played Witcher 3 GOTY and now I'm playing Spiderman GOTY. Much better uses of time imo
---
Leave the server and enter a new one, that works for 95% of the buggs in the game
---
This is the best. 
---
Combine Stealth Boy M3s with the Secret Agent perk maxed out and the magazine that extends their time limit...and you have six minutes of sneaky sneaky times.
---
16 TIMES THE DETAIL.....DETAIL.....DETAIL.....
---
God, I can picture that. Sometimes, when I sleep, I just here the words "buy Skyrim" in my ear....
---
Plz someone tag someone from Bethesda in this post. This would be extremely helpful.
---
No one plays it. That‚Äôs why.
---
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  I'm not sure why there were only two of us at the start though. When I clicked the event  both (failed) times, there were 6 people in there.  I was the 7th.
---
I always forget to switch to Modify, so I end up coming out of crafting, opening my pipboy &amp; scrolling through, only to have to go to crafting again. I've facepalmed so many times now that I have a permanent red bruise on my face. ü§™ Anyway, OP gets an upvote from me on this topic.
---
The funny thing is...when I started playing high level players would drop off these huge care packages of ammo, plans, stim packs, etc. and I thought "What lovely people!"
---
Now, 110 levels later, I drop off the same stuff and think "Thank God, now I can fast travel again!" ;)
---
The flatwoods monster can take control of turrets so yes, I have seen this.
---
Same thing happened to me in two different instances the other day. Was wack.
---
If I didn't use excavator my legs would be broken.
---
And thank you to Bethesda for still not patching the ammo factory blueprint glitch. 
---
Some of us would rather not play this game üòÖ
---
Add it as a side event, but the Meat Cook needs to stay where it‚Äôs at.
---
I guess the same reason for frolicking mole rats?  I asked this very question of myself and so self checked the next time I got the option to stay or go. It was mole rats. I‚Äôm assuming your tent is larger than that but mostly just because it works.
---
Which is why I want to see this article.
---
With the amount of shit people say about Bethesda, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôve just ‚Äòturned off notifications‚Äô for their fanbase. So many people want the perfect game but know nothing about coding. It‚Äôs like The Boy who Cried Wolf. Why would you expect them to listen when most of their critique is childish complaining.
---
Fair enough.
---
I was wondering how i ended up with the forest scout mask and urban scout mask. Good thing i didn't sell them to the vendor like I thought about lol
---
To be fair they did encourage the nuking of Helvetia when Fasnacht came around and fast traveling to public events is free. Also One Wasteland will be out at that point (I think?) so the enemies wouldn‚Äôt be too difficult for lower levels.
---
Ah I see you're finally awake....
---
Well when I made the decision I thought it was incredibly hard to get gold bullion and easy to get reputation, so I decided to take hit on the reputation.  Once I googled after I had made my decision I quickly found out that the big hit in reputation was not worth the 500 extra gold bullion. I haven't found a use for the gold bullion yet, while my reputation has gone done an entire level IIRC.
---
I should've made another decision but the game didn't really do well to educate me enough so I guess it's not entirely my fault.
---
I think it became the handmade because there is a guy on a forum that literally made an Ak out of a shovel. I think someone on the F4 team was a fan of where ever that was posted first.
---
Flatwoods is smaller, and has less crates. It's also harder to hide.
---
Vets still like Flatwoods just for th he challenge, but most people I've ran with who started after MT dropped seem to prefer it over FW
---
In all seriousness, for the first couple of days life was hard...just getting enough food, water and radaway was a struggle.  I only survived because of generous people who left their water purifiers unlocked and put their decontamination showers where a n00b like me could use them.
---
but but... that would make sense.
---
Yeah, hate that with any weapon that uses cores does that.
---
Been a while since I used my Gatling Laser, wonder, if I use a PA, will the PA automatically use those near dead cores?
---
Vampire's.  Vampire heavy weapon (I use 50 cal ffr).  You literally can't die as long as you're firing at something.
---
Judging from my luck with them I might as well check them out while at the script machine.
---
What about solo (i.e. without rad sponge?). Is it viable in a nuke zone? Do you need to take diluted rad-x and radshield?
---
What does "relogs" mean?
---
Don‚Äôt you love getting downvoted for explaining how and why things work? Been there, man. No one cares about the reasons, they just want what they want.
---
Can confirm.
---
Mine sure doesn't lol
---
That sucks to hear but this is the answer I was looking for. Thanks.
---
I never understood why the computer who is trying to stop you spawns in the robots to use the computers to prep launch.  
---
Not only that but it lets you respawn them when they are killed!  
---
It's also nice enough to let you know when you don't have a keycard.
---
Are the pins rare?
---
If you time it right it would only be for like 20 seconds at most. Not a big deal at all.
---
Yea they do.
---
You still need to take radaway from time to time. RadShield ect. can also help out
---
Try the electric station near Helvetia and tyagart water plant.  Usually mole rats there.  And about 1/2 the time on a defend at the gad lake workshop.
---
My first encounter with a wendigo involved me shooting it once with a sneak attack head shot, and only taking like 10% of it's health.
---
Followed my me yelling "NOPE!" repeatedly and then jumping off a cliff trying to get away. This was at the Bivouac near West Tek.
---
I don't want to say vampire's heavy weapon low health is op, but it's opness level is insanely huge.
---
This is the way
---
I run better criticals 2 and a 4 leaf clover.
---
While it's not a dress, the Pink Captain Cosmos outfit is the kind of Retro 50s style Sexism I expect my Vault Dweller had drilled into her at a young age that she should be wearing that one.
---
Excavator 4 Lyfe.
---
Even when tanking Earl or SBQ.
---
Also can confirm.
---
There was a gold one too!
---
People are already doing fuck all down there.  I've had more runs fail because 4\8 AFK for rewards and then we fail.  Everyone shits on the low levels jumping in but recently the low levels have been doing spawn control while the level 250+s sit there spinning in the corner.  So then you have 2-3 people at most actively attacking Earle, even if you have a gun that melts HP it's hard to beat him with the spawns and the fear. Honestly they need to open the event to more than 8 because if you aren't in the first group you will end up with 2 other people.
---
Yep. I've burned threw two improved repair kits in one event before
---
Those are locked. I have repaired peoples weapons for them though. They have to give you the weapon and you repair it with a kit then give it back. 
---
Takes quite a bit of trust to do that though.
---
I had made a Valentine's Day suggestion with the introduction of various wedding dresses (dirty, bloodied, pristine).
---
Nothing more feminine than a girl in a bloody wedding dress wielding a chainsaw.
---
Now it needs to be as simple not masturbation shack
---
I am looking forward to the addition of PA displays. Maybe actually going to buy the red rocket PA station just because of it.
---
It does not need to be there.
---
Check the market sub friend.
---
No it doesn't. It's the same for bolstering.
---
That only shows up about 20% of the time for me
---
I've seen people with over 5000 notes
---
I imagine the only real opportunity for a larger scale of character customisation would be if Bethesda made a community creator tool for fans to design and submit to a small team to process before making and uploading to the atom shop. If anything character customisation comes to the store it‚Äôs pretty much once every few months which is sad in my opinion. I would like to see something like community created cosmetics since it achieves more than just the cosmetics themselves but provides a more frequent and larger rotation of goodies in the atom store while giving developers space to work on the game more efficiently. At least I would like to think it would work out that way so we can all benefit.
---
They need to be buffed or gotten rid of. Whenever I get one I just throw it immediately to not be weighed down by their pointlessness
---
As far as I know its patched now
---
Unless you are using a beast weapon whatever you take down will break.  My flamer melts him, but it breaks after 2 minutes, just like my cryo at the SBQ.  I can fix them right before the event and it still happens.  Luckily there are tables up top but you have to die.
---
The +35 doesn't show on the piece itself. Say you have a complete set of unmodified ss armor, that's 220 dr, but if it's vanguard, and you're full health,  it's 395.
---
Without using major buffs or magic weapons, I can get him in under 2 minutes.
---
How did you get your data?
---
If you did the ammo factory glitch does some wonky stuff to camps.. However, usually completing moving the camp fixes it so I‚Äôm not really sure bro.
---
Thanks! As a non-bloodied build, I'll keep this in mind.
---
I find it annoying to try switching amidst all else going on. If you join my building team, go ahead an expect it to remain a building team as the event ends. My focus is on screws and drops, not your "thousands of xp".i dont have any use for the XP, im not in any hurry to level and still do somehow at least once a day.
---
It shows on the Dr numbers of the stats page of your total armor, but not on individual pieces.
---
I got it during sbq
---
I can‚Äôt even get hits in at Line in the Sand now. Few dudes rock up with legacies and everything is dead before my flaming bow catches fire to anything.
---
Vamps is underrated.
---
We need a way to find lootable corpses in general and legendaries in particular. Just thinking about the time I've wasted hunting for a corpse in the cranberry bog or the mire makes me mad.
---
How about a new flavor of mentats that highlights corpses instead of living targets? Or a perk card that gives you some kind of visual pointer. Or they could just &lt;throwing out a wild idea here&gt; make corpses easy to see by default. A little flag or pointer, for instance. We'll say the pipboy is doing it.
---
If anyone has played Horizon: Zero Dawn, you may remember that they did exactly that. FO76 needs to rip off that feature.
---
I don't think so, or at least, if they are now they didn't used to be. I haven't noticed any on liberators lately come to think of it, but I'm probably sitting on hundreds from the beta. I think they just make cool display pieces.
---
It just happened to me. I'm new so what do I do now?
---
