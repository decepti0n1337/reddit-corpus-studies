I'm mixed honestly. The ranger outfit is cool the scrapbox is useful but the survival tent is fantastic. I didn't appreciate the private server that much at first but after I did a public event on a public server and a player tried to kill me after I wouldn't give him my ammo he wanted I tried private servers again today and it was kinda nice. I don't get attacked by players much and generally have a good experience but still its nice to have the option. But will I keep fallout 1st? Not sure. I'm gonna see how they update it and go from there.
---
---
---
JFFR will be higher DPS
---

---
JE will have higher per hit damage, but at the expense of weapon degredation and possibly hurting yourself from blowback if stuff gets close.
---
If you are looking for the best option for both PVP and PVE I would use the FFR because most PVPers roll with full explosive immunities (Fireproof/Dense)
---
Are you using someone else to hold the world or if you quickly change character it puts you back in the same world, or is the scrapbox shared between charactets?     - just curious as I once lost a lot of items trying to transfer due to a crash.
---
Hey everyone, /r/theouterworlds is calling.  It's the devs of Fallout: New Vegas and kicks ass, having the same 'feel' as fallout.
---
Sounds like you took a fair approach there.
---
I wish we could learn all the details, even do much as screenshots of the support tickets - seems a little shocking they aren't included if it's so damning towards Bethesda, as alleged.
---
I think your take is pretty on point, whether it's a cease and desist or something unmentioned.
---
If I tried out an exploit just to test if it worked, I wholly expect I would be banned.
---
I can't speak for them of course but based on dataminers posts around this sub I'd say they weren't looking for that issue specifically, but rather just digging around. literally every single popular game has people dedicated to reversing it.
---
doctor who does sort of exist in the fallout universe
---
Then you are doing it wrong. Completely wrong.
---
 Every single location on the map has junk. You take that junk and then you scrap that junk. Now you have what you asked for without someone doing for you.
---
i have question why did he buy fallout 1st if he thought the base game was flawed?
---
also he used the consumables included with the subscription he is not entitled to a refund
---
...it would not be unusual for people to work against their own interests? because that wouldn't even be a smokescreen, they could hack away and Bethesda would never find out.
---
&gt; How does the world work in your imagination? Someone buys a game and they just join the dev team? Please, enlighten me. I'd love to know even one game that has done that.

---
It's amazing how quickly Bethesda went from being a widely loved and celebrated game company that was regularly cited as having the right idea about how to do addons to the butt of most jokes in the gaming community.
---
Just me solo. Do it quick and not  something you'd hate to lose. If trying to move the good stuff have a friend join ya. It's only a few minute window, server should stay just as they say it would if you left friends in it that had no subscription. 12 to 15 mins server will shut down.
---
It's an odd situation to begin with. In a game where people race over resources I would imagine a data mined site pin pointing exactly where everything is would be the last thing I'd want out there. I guess people here enjoy server hopping.
---
I'd park both toons at overseers camp outside vault 76, put items in overseers stash and then log to mule and collect
---
I don't disagree, but if I want to support my players and my Discord and play modes they want I should be able to without harassment.
---
All three companies will immediately ban you for exploiting, no matter what your intention was. And they have. You can google the accidental bans on GTAO. Exploiting is so rampant they were catching everyone who had mods period, and they didn’t let them back onto normal gtao afterwards. They’re still stuck on the exploiter flagged servers.
---
You should really know all this if you’re going to make up a magical world where companies listen to individual players they know nothing about. I’m sure they have plenty of time to read through thousands of submissions by people who have no proven experience, and they should simultaneously be allowed to do whatever they want because “they’re helping”.

Did you actually read what you were saying back to yourself?

Now? Now they are acting stupid? They've been acting stupid.

I quit 76 a long time ago, it's unplayable in this state and because I don't have a good computer I could only run maybe medium settings when I first got it in January, but now I can't even run low. It's garbage.
---
Why do people on this sub still support this game. You can play it while still calling it what it is. Its called being critical, not "raging"
---
I have it ranked up 2x and my shit lasts a good long while
---
I have same issue on xbox. Lag is worse if more than 1 enemy. I had to switch from melee to rifle to play at all. It has been about 3 weeks for me and getting worse. I was blaming it on event week but has not improved this week. My game crashed about half of my attempts at event.
---
&gt; Its now almost a year and the game is almost as broken as at release day. Its full of bugs, performance issues and still fucking lacking in content.
---
lol what an exaggeration
---
full of bugs? 
---
there are issues sure but most of them are fixed
---
performance issues? 
---
check your settings the ultra settings for this game are insane
---
low shadow distance is like 4 times the shadow distance of fallout 4 s ultra 
---
&gt; still fucking lacking in content.
---
theres scorchbeast queen,vault 94,project paradise,sheepsquach farm ,nuclear winter cosmetic rewards
---
the game doesn't have wow levels of content but there is stuff to do
---
&gt;ATOM Shop bullshit to milk wales
---
didn't know 18$ made me a whale ,i should buy the latest mediocre triple A for 60$ instead /s
---
&gt;,3 dungeons that are basically abandoned after a week of release
---
they are actually fine but ok lol
---
&gt;a PvP mode no one wanted
---
speak for yourself
---
&gt;that got abandoned instead of made better and is now a feast for hackers.
---
i wouldn't call it exactly abandoned but okay 
---
&gt;Sorry for the rant, but honestly, i was such a huge fan and what Bethesda did with the Fallout franchise honestly broke my heart.
---
its amazing how rent free fallout 76 lives in your head
---
sports team syndrome
---
For steel and plastic, kill a lot of super mutants, collect all the loot, then equip scrapper before you break it all down.
---
Only if you spend those free atoms on cosmetics Plebe
---
I would argue that virtual currency in and of itself isn't a consumable.   It's not used in game.  It's used in the shop outside of the game.  Bethesda could always revoke the ability to use the item(s) purchased.
---
It could have been fun. It's not, though. In fact, it's a huge piece of fucking wet dog shit. They had every fucking element to make it a really fucking awesome game, but they consciously made it garbage.
---
nope
---
those are people with the mental capacity of a child
---
i met them all the time,taking out their frustrations on the low ranking employees instead of the people actually making their decisions
---
Oh I didn’t know they stacked!
---
Collector is...meh you can get way more from looting a POI the only thing somewhat good is its passive but even still not great
---
Fridge...i regret buying I literally never use it, if it was passive and just kept food longer itd be a worthy buy but you have to manually put stuff in it...and then remember to grab it before you go do whatever you need it for....which I never do
---
Yeah it’s a useful perk. I personally use the backpack fridge mod but none of that stuff stacks together.
---
I'm sure there's still risk, but a much more stable option imo, all toons in the account should log to "your" server. That's how I do it with no one to join back into the server on.
---
Or maybe it's so that they have all the information they need nicely given to them in a single email. Smoke a joint or have some calming tea, this is a really petty thing to be worked up about.
---
Or you can just stop playing this abortion instead of egging on Bethesda with incentive to keep on boning you in the ass.
---
It is very easy to look at the game files without engaging in a bannable offence. 
---
There is no reason to use CE for ‘digging through the files’ tbh. 
---
Any modder can do this using well known tools without “hacking” their game. 
---
Using CE is a known redline and tbh no need too imho unless your toeing the line which is risky

Sweet thanks!

For the first time in a while Ive kinda stopped playing 76  they where doing great and then they relased the first subscription which is kinda cool for the awesome ranger outfit and monthly atom allowance I get but other then that im not really gonna pay again next month for it because I just don’t feel like playing and see the point of having it if im not gonna play becau of them continually shooting themselves in the foot by doing dumb shit like this and not updating their news and then adding a bunch of halloween stuffs after halloween and expecting people to pay for it. Ive been having a much better time playing Outer Worlds and honestly after playing it makes me wish that obsidian still had the Fallout franchise because after playing Outer Worlds I realize the potential they would have to make a new fallout
---
Fuck Bethesda.
---
Brave statement to make, I know.
---
I just loot *everything* from every place I visit and I’m hardly ever short unless I’m trying to repair a few guns at once. Then sell the bulk leftovers. You could loot everything from Flatwoods, or tag the items you need and just pick up those.
---
I'm on xbox but....are you serious about it being cheat engine? Cheat engine doesnt even work on most of the indie games I used to play because the devs knew what they were doing
---
If you wanted to suck Todd's dick, you could just buy a plane ticket to Maryland.
---
Nah, it's lag.
---
I mean, look at Dross Toss.
---
not yet
---
but by my experience tickets dont go anywhere either
---
2 months ago i had a week-long back and forth conversation with tech support (not customer support) from bethesda about the Strangler Heart Power Armor making me crash
---
instead of a fix we got Fallout 1st
---
also i m posting this here to let you guys know and get confirmation or be proven wrong
---
Haha yeah that would make no sense realistically. Barrel would get so hot it wouldn’t work. 
---
If Bethesda set it so your gun breaks 80% faster then I’ll be down.  Although a suppressor for .50 cal machine guns is not a thing anywhere. 
---
Maybe we can start with a barrel shroud or muzzle device attachments. Or larger magazine.  If we could change our backpacks to hold machine gun belts then we could raise the belt limit to 1000 rounds like in real life. 
---
Sneaky heavy machine guns is not a thing. Anywhere.
---
could be, but i switched to my alt before the Vault Raid and the SBQ and we had some other people join the server
---
yet the spawn situation did not change
---
Purchased. 
---
Love it. 
---
No regrets.
---
These are unfortunately the only posts I see 'Bethesda Replied' to now. Sad days. Months. Year.
---
Todd said in an interview npcs were not planned and based on feedback they started working on them Jan 2019. It was one of the first interviews with him leading up to this summer's dlc. Just before the podcast when he said someone mailed him Bobby pins.
---
&gt; I think the outrage over the game is largely overblown
---
"I think the outrage over the game is largely overblown"
---
If you cant understand the outrage over this piece of shit, I highly suggest you to go spend some of your fallout Atoms and buy yourself a clue my friend.
---
First aid isnt necessary if you are running bloodied.  Especially if you are in range of nerd rage.  You will only have like 50 or 60 health depending on endurance.  I actually run diluted stimpaks without first aid and it's almost always enough.  Regular stimpaks are overkill but useful if you're about to take a beating and need some heals in reserve and a bigger hot.  I never get to the supers even when face tanking the queen so I just sell em.
---
abandoned bog town is your friend
---
You can silence a .50 BMG
---
Barrett makes a 50 silencer.
---
Its just really really expensive.
---
They are suppressors. They just quiet it by a little. Still extremely loud! I’ve shot one
---
Ah yes, Dross Toss. Where I can make the Dross land literally nowhere near the tires yet get credit for them anyway
---
I wonder why they're laggy as fuck but regular grenades aren't
---
Of couse it is. I will beat you and win everytime! My fridge, my robot and I will destroy you!
---
Epic
---
Its definitely a tricky one. This case seems to me that he's bitter about the alts, then didn't get what he wanted when he complained and... now this. But if his experience genuinely isn't up to scratch (simplified) then he can get it. So I'm on Beth's side on this one but only just. There has been a lot of bad press involving refunds lately, so you gotta question their decisions. I  bought the game pre order and have been promised features that are now locked behind a large subscription. I think there should be client side private servers,  even just solo. We should all have unlimited srap as that supposedly affects stability. I wont be going for a refund  tho. Too much hassle.
---
I understand op though. So many bugs still with us, so many recurring after patches. I play this game every day, but when I introduce someone new I find myself making so many excuses, and constantly trying to point out the cool fun stuff to try to balance out the obvious problems. I agree they have moved forward, sometimes in excellent ways, sometime more of 2 steps forward 1 step back . But communication from then is spotty at best, and particularly terrible recently.
---
You were truly an asset to the fo76 community, sucks to see Bethesda eat shit so hard on this
---
Sweet!
---
Were you on PS4? And hanging out at my camp in the Forest?
---
Me too
---
Is it honestly surprising Bugthesda would do something like this? This is the same company that couldn't even release a subscription service without it being a broken, buggy, POS. You think their not dumb enough to ban people trying to help them?
---
Regardless of the how bugthesda is incompitent at fixing anything thenselves. This bug will probubly be here for the next 3 months before they even glance at it. Even then their fix will either be something pazy/ineffective or it'll just break the game again.
---
I use hazmat suit (I hate PA) and 19% on my bloodied stealth guy in a nuke zone, it's a lot of fun trying to stay alive, watching health half the time. Contrasted by my other two Junkies characters who are rather tanky, one uses 5 ranks in demo expert, other uses Gunsmith 3 and Batteries Included 2 (both for Plasma rifle usage).
---
I love teaming with new players and taking them straight there. They always seem so happy when they make it to the very top after falling and dying multiple times.
---
not true. to this day dataminers aren't exactly sure how stealth works because some of the values and how they interact with the environment are hardcoded into the executable, for example.
---
No, its not.  You need to dump at least 20 through it to get the barrel hot enough to start smoking. 
---
I do this every weekend.  Fast Firing my M82A3 is a common occurance.
---
No such thing as a silencer.  They are all supressors.  
---
There are only 2 rounds currently on the market in common production that are silenceable.   A  .45acp, and a subsonic .22lr,
---
These are subsonic rounds which means there is no sonic boom (or crack for small arms fire).
---
To get them to silence, you cannot use a revolver or an auto.  You will need to have them run through a bolt action, single shot, or lever action rifle that does not have a gas operated mechnic, drum or a blowback mechanism that allows gas to escape from anywhere other than the muzzle.
---
There is no such thing as a silencer, but it is a term in wide use.  Litterally it makes the gun more silent, but not completely,.   
---
Surpressor is a better term, but most people dont understand the difference.   Unless you are a gun nut, you will not care which term is used.   Gamers are for the most part not gun nuts, and use silencer interchangably with surpressor, and since its a more common term, i used it in my post.
---
Nah... You made a shit joke...I corrected you...
---
Move on, kiddo...
---
Biv's place is a wonderful microcosm of 76 junk. Oil, steel, cloth, plastic, acid, antiseptic, crystal, nuclear material, copper, aluminum, screws, rubber, asbestos, lead, 4medx, addictol, various alcohols, possible bobblehead spawn, possible magazine spawn. Sure I missed some stuff, and there may not be a single gear there.
---
The ability to move stuff between characters is a real bonus. Excellent gear that was taking up space is now being used by the right characters.
---
I play on PS4 and rarely if ever crash.
---
 I have played since Beta and it has never crashed constantly.  In my experience all of the negativity is way over exaggerated and still is.
---
 I guarantee you'll enjoy it if you buy it.
---
of course there is. so they cab implement them as Fo1st features.
---
tanning station, anyone?
---
Be careful you might get banned
---
Yes, you can trade the plans.
---
They’re definitely listening to QoL requests, they need ideas for the Atomic Shop and Fallout 1st.
---
I want my fully kitted two shot one back that fell through the map
---
But Bethesda does not care
---
I agree, tho in honesty, is one already available for no fee. Just need some one trustworthy, and luck. I just see a private server as way more stable.
---
I got you. So if I busted out a semi auto barret with ten shots back to back, it will not smoke? Either way I was using the example as a realistic reason you don’t see suppressors on .50 cal machine guns. And a suppressor heats up way way faster than a barrel. 
---
Silencer=suppressor as a clip=magazine
---
Games have screwed with our definitions.
---
Thank you. What do you think a good value is? If you don't mind me asking.
---
Thanks funny as hell. Although I do think I felt a little disappointed in myself...
---
Instead of being outraged over a video game, go play a different one. That anger could be put to much better use by directing it at something that actually matters. Politics, poverty, civil rights, etc, etc. The list is virtually endless.
---
You have to be on a server when the death blossoms event is completed by someone other than you, starting the quest and leaving the quest area at the end should work but I’ve yet to try it.
---
They are worth a fair bit. It's not unreasonable to ask 15k or for god roll items in trade.
---
Oh man so basically the actual way to get them is fucked up eh?
---
&gt;If they quit giving a shit about this game, I will to
---
This implies they ever gave a shit about this game.
---
They never have, they never will. It's purely a Vault Tec level experiment in how much bullshit people will put up with to play Fallout.
---
Expect all of this garbage to be integrated into ESVI when it hits.
---
I think I have 2k hours in the different versions of skyrim all added up, probably hundreds of hours in league of legends and I still play. Hundreds of hours in overwatch and WoW back in the day too. So to answer your question. Yes
---
Thank you for your input. I dont think I couldn't go that high. I actually don't mind working on the challenges between the dailies.
---
You should give Outer Worlds a shot. No abusive practices and it's the spiritual successor to NV.
---
They have, but when in rome, do as the romans do.
---
I completely agree with you on an auto rifle not being viable as a silenced item.  Too much lead and gas clog up the baffles and cause the surpressor to not function.   They are not meant for autos.  And artillary peices (which is basically what heavy guns are) arnt meant to be sneaky.  
---
When I rapid fire out my .50, the barrel doesnt smoke from heat, it smokes because I just dumped 50 bucks in lead and gunpowder through it.   It takes the second mag to start doing the rapid fire smokey that you see with AR mag dumps.
---
Happen to remember where you read about the BOS mutant soldiers?
---
Nope. Doesnt make sense. It is supposed to b loud
---
the cannonballs whisper shhh before they contact for extra effect
---
I got 100 caps.  Wanna trade?  For real though is that the plan for bigger backpacks?  I can not bring myself to do all the challenges.
---
Ah no. Was Xbox on golf course
---
On xbox I traded 21 badges for bloodied explosive Gatlin plasma to give u some idea of their worth
---
Woah
---
So you did use cheat engine and Bethesda was not wrong about the ban. It wouldn't be right for Bethesda to not ban you Just because you are somewhat known in the community. Heard you got unbanned after the fiasco. One would consider that a privilege but seeing how you done good for the community, I suppose Bethesda made the right choice. It would have been a lot better if you didn't have to use cheat engine from the beginning so that you wouldn't get banned in the first place
---
Ahhh okay!
---
That sucks. 
---
I wouldn't mind pvp'ing, in fact I had created a character just for survival but I didn't like the original top three map reveal. I was excited when they removed all map markers but thought the damage cap was stupid. 
---
I don't care for VATS either so the thought that it's now the primary way to be successful in pvp is frustrating.
---
gg
---
Ah yes it's totally not like the reason they had skins was to support said product. And they even added p2w features for the game which is terrible. You can make a game profitable without being greedy. It's called making a good game. That doesn't launch broken
---
Considering I was using it to make sure they entirely fixed a security flaw that they weren't even aware about before and since I knew the best way to find it I shouldn't have been banned in the first place.
---
There's a 3 hour video on YouTube just listing bugs. Genuinely the greediest and worst developers ever, even worse than ea. "CoSmEtIc oNlY" shop
---
I was thinking of just the normal backpacks (lvl50 - 60lbs). The high capacity backpack plan is 8 badges and well dont think I could hold the money I'd want to sell it for. I'd have to do trades  and that's more of a grind than possum challenges to me.
---
On a side note, if you’re really sick of fallout 76 or fallout 4 try Outer Worlds.  It was made by obsidian and feels like Fallout 3, and New Vegas. It may be only a single player game, but it’s pretty good. I’d give it a solid 9/10. It just has that type of fallout humor in it, and your choices and dialogue affect the game in a big way again.
---
Somebody mind telling me what this is?
---
Yea pretty silly to make it so you have to avoid joining the event but find someone to complete it for you to get the better rewards
---
If you make it through the other side of the cricket horde keep going up. There's some royal jelly up there (the edible kind not the junk kind) in a meth lab bathtub on the top floor of a pretty jacked up house. You need 3 of them to complete a recipe for a possum badge and that's one of three possible spawn points in the whole world for royal jelly. (The other being in a picnic basket near a gravesite at Middle Mountain Cabins.)
---
You don't necessarily need to complete the challenges. You can also sometimes get Possum badges as a reward for completing Campfire Tales, Operation Tidy and Stings and Things.
---
And don't forget to pay your subscription boys, you are gonna miss that exclusive new color.
---
I'm sorry to hear this grief. Just look for another game, there are plenty of good opportunities out there.
---
Yeah rediculous, it'd be great if there were more ways of getting them too to make supers a bit easier to craft if you know where to get them, strangler pods are a little tricky to find but they're at least out there
---
funny how the sheep is the one calling me a shill
---
On ps4, I've traded the High Capacity one for an AAE Gatling Plasma and the Armor one for a TSE Cryolator...and that was before they nerfed the Campfire Tales spawn.
---
Well that's what you get for your continued support of a piece of shit company and game
---
If only this cheat engine stuff had any relevance to the topic.
---
Yeah I need to do something.  Just have free backpack ,and have yet to start the trek to get a bigger one.   It is my fault,  I have little time to game like I used to.  So any grind always seem daunting.
---
It’s a good perk to have in your back pocket. But not one to run 100% of the time. I love demolition expert during silo runs. Takes just a couple minutes to destroy mainframe cores solo
---
I do most of that. In between the Operation Tidy and Stings and Things failed I do the challenges. They nerfed Campfire Tales or something because I have done it 20 times at least and not gotten one badge.
---
I'm beginning to wonder if support was given an order of silence because this is the first time they're just going completely silent on me after communicating with them about an issue. It's definitely disappointing.
---
Yeah, I'm done with Bethesda. Going back to unmodded Skyrim and pretending that it's the last game they ever made.
---
This post literally makes me want to quit this game, this is why I hate Bethesda and zenamax, they are greedy process of garbage that don't deserve almost any if the support they get
---
So they did nerf it. I thought something fishy was going on. Never gotten a badge from that daily, must have done it 20 times.
---
You do realize that bans are automated in most cases? It's the machines that are scanning for cheat engines. Sure Bethesda might have reviewed banned users themselves, but there's no telling they should know about you. It would be nice if they did, but don't expect them to go like 'oooooh it's eckserah, I can't ban him or something like that. Very unlikely. 
---
As much as you are doing good for the community, Bethesda is doing the same thing. They are actually banning cheaters for once. I really don't like where this is going since recent fiasco might hinder Bethesda from banning bad users. You shouldn't have used cheat engines in the first place, and if you did, you shouldn't have it public. Now we are fucked and we might have to wait for what, another 6 months to see those cheaters getting banned now? Not good man
---
Well, for example to claim innocence.
---
Meh. I just needed atoms and wanted the outfit and emotes. 
---
Still it's nice being able to loot places without competing. 
---
Only thing keeping me in right now. The lack of content was going to make me take time off from the game until wastelanders came out (of course I came back for mischief night) Sunk cost fallacy (fk that guy) makes me want to grind and fill up the scrap box as much as possible (over 4 characters) Before my 1 month expires.
---
The dataminers themselves have admitted they were wrongfully banned. Hell one just got unbanned earlier today from this.
---
So there you have it. Aten\_Ra is not banned, he did not use cheat engines while others did and got banned
---
how the fuck is it even remotely a successor lmao
---
It's like trading in a car. The dealer gives you a fraction of what it's worth.
---
Damn that's crazy.  I thought SBQ was hard coded to be Legendary, how is that even possible?
---
I wonder if Legendaries work on a list system like containers (theorized here https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ah49zq/how_item_respawns_actually_work/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) but with a global list instead of individual.  With only 4 people the list doesn't fill fast enough to turn over.  
---
To test this I guess you'd have to go to an area you don't normally frequent and see if you can get a Legendary to spawn there?  Have you tried new locations or do you stick to the tried and true areas?
---
Game companies, especially those running online services, simply can't survive without positive coverage from their playerbase and the media. Look to Wildstar as a recent example of a perfectly competent MMO with an energized fan base that tanked its own middling success through bad coverage and terrible community mismanagement. I get that you're one of the 6 or 7 people still playing this game, so you don't want to hear it, but Bethesda can't go on being trashed by both their players and the media. I guarantee they are hemorrhaging money on 76 at this point. They need positive coverage and player engagement now more than anything, and as companies like Carbine found out, a bad response to your energized and positive community can easily and instantly turn them sour on you. Bethesda simply can't afford that with Fallout 76. I suspect it has months of operation left, companies that expect to be able to make a year's worth of money off a monthly subscription don't offer yearly subscription packages.
---
Hey thanks for the insight! after this bit of information I'll definately look into trying to trade my  BE50 cal amd another weapon for one
---
I mean they nerfed the event starting. It used to be anytime at night, you could start it. Now it's part of the event rotation, so it pops up less frequently.
---
Actually the tetracromatic person is seeing the correct colors, the person only seeing red is only seeing a small spectrum of the light coming off the ball. That is my point.
---
just spitballing but on PC the shadow grass item and object sliders are disabled in NW.  could be the same for ps4.  meaning more textures are loaded in regular mode
---
Don't think so, but could be wrong
---
The problem being that it took me 13 days to get any sort of human response from the customer service and even then I only got the unsuspended email
---
I see. Well must be bad rng for me. Dont like that daily anyway.
---
Trying armor bench to make sure im not just losing it..
---
Yeah. I do it whenever I can, and the dailies. I'll not get a badge for a few days, then I'll get a bunch in a row. It be a fickle mistress.
---
Bethesda plz unban the guy and unfuck the situation
---
 I dunno. I have just noticed that a lot of the problems you describe are worse on consoles. 
---
 I don't run into these things on PC, but to be fair I don't participate in events much, as I have to kill stuff fast with my Combat Knives and people don't like that.
---
Value is what a vendor will sell it to you for.
---
What you sell it to a vendor for will be at maximum 50% of its value, and that is impacted by Charisma.  for a 21cap item, to get 10 caps out of it you will need a full 15 cha and hard bargain.
---
I would not trade the BE50, its godmode endgame for heavies.
---
I would find another way to pick up a Junkies, because you will hate yourself as soon as you sell the BE
---
LMAO, looks like you are wrong, now that Aten_ra has gotten here. Want to keep looking like the fool you are now?
---
Other people have been mentioning they can’t equip the jack o lantern bucket again either.  Guess we gotta wait for a fix from Bethesda.
---
Uh no, did you even read what he said? He doesn't do reporting of bugs much anymore, his discord does and he vouched they were wrongly banned.
---
When you realize there's only 1 AAA gaming company that has not become greedy corp.
---
I need a group. I haven't done it much at all though. So I would need some tips. I have a Bloodied Build.
---
gamestop be like
---
During datamining and analysis you come across code or API calls that seem like they could be problematic. In order to know if it's exploitable you must run tests on it. After completing a successful exploit you document the process and submit it directly to the company.  
---
A reputable company will use their logs to ban anyone knowingly abusing the bug for the purpose of personal gain. It is very easy to tell if someone either did the exploit to test it, or someone who is abusing it.
---
Just happened to me after playing on a different account on ps4🤣
---
What are toons? Characters?
---
Yeah. Considering most people don't even get any form of responses, one could consider that a privilege. Getting actually unbanned is more so. If I was you, I would have expected this to happen and came up with an alt account on a different machine to dodge the ban. I mean, if you are using a cheat engine, this is something to be expected.
---
I'm done, 100% done.  I'll happily pirate any future games I wasn't bad enough that I'm tempted to pay money for.
---
I won't be playing any online game they release ever again.
---
Nah, they only comment to cutesy comments like getting married in game and other cringey gag-inducing stories.
---
So much for subscriptions helping to improve general gameplay
---
Lul you are the big one you read that wrong. That guy up there claims people were banned for just reporting bugs and I was arguing why the fuck is Aren\_ra, one of the big ones aren't getting banned while he's reporting them bugs all the time? So I assumed you didn't use cheat engines while others did
---
I hate companies that give me cut and paste responses. It tells me that they didn't really take the time to give my issue a thought. I would rather have no response, because I could live in a fantasy world that maybe they just didn't see it.
---
Using cheatengine is only against the rules if you use it to modify the memory of the game, just viewing it isn't against the TOS. You may want to read the TOS closer, it says "no use of third party programs to MODIFY the game". Looking at something isn't modifying it.
---
 Hunting Rifle. Learn to use it and scrap all the ones you find. It becomes by far the best early game weapon quite quickly. Put a tactical sight on it, a long barrel and a perforating mag and you can clear any early game stuff by one shoting almost everything. 
---
 You have to learn and adapt to its rythm to use it well. Reload often! ;)
---
thanks for the tips
---
Fun fact. I was the guy that brought up about the "sleeping ghouls" at whitesprings attacking me. Valseek responded with that exact response. They fixed the issue and then it came back many patches ago...
---
Seeing how you tried to summon him and asked him if he was banned or not, that wasn't what you were claiming several hours ago and you had absolutely no idea about it. Now you are shoving something not related and trying to move that goalpost again. Aten\_Ra didn't use no cheat engines, others in his team did, Atre\_ra didn't get banned, others did
---
No, I said those who reported the exploit, once again you even admitted that was the case. Now you are trying to move the goalposts after you got proven wrong.
---
You also tried to claim aten_ra was a major bug reporter, he already stated he isn't and didn't report that bug, but many of his trusted friends who were got banned for it.
---
So no, you just completely lost any semblance of an argument you had when Aten_ra came in here and just shut you completely down.
---
You should try Red Dead Online if you two are playing together. It’s not as great as GTA online, but there’s no hackers, griefers can only bother you for about a minute if you let them, and right now there’s tons of content and beautiful scenery to explore if you’ve never played it before. And it looks and plays SO MUCH better than F76 ever has.
---
Is there a source? Where do they say that?
---
In the TOS you have to agree to before logging into the launcher. Under third party programs.
---
I don't understand why so many people on this sub are even sticking around here. Bethesda has already shown their true colours by selling peoples' ideas back to them, so why would you keep contributing to their bullshit? Even if they do use your idea, you won't get any credit for it.
---
I have one. It was a reward for an event. IIRC, all events have a super small chance for cool clothes.
---
No he didn't. I was arguing that the team might have used cheat engines except Aten\_ra and may that's why he wasn't banned. It turns out I was right. It's only been several hours. If you'd take your time and re-read the comments, that would be greatly appreciated
---
A trek among the stars?
---
Happy Cakeday!
---
Once again, using CE to view memory isn't against the TOS of FO76, using to MODIFY the memory is. There is a very large difference.
---
Isn't Bethesda privately owned, or did that change? I don't think they're public, so it's not a wall street thing.
---
That cave isn't just great for ant farming... It's literally a gold mine. Lots of gold and crystal veins. Keep an eye out for the ancient metal face, as well.
---
So where in TOS is that written? I'm looking at it right now let's see if we both have same understandings here
---
If a game doesn't have an official policy on restoring lost items you should probably not be wasting your time.  Even in far better constructed games I've played in the past that actually had official item restoration services these things were not treated lightly, for example it was either enough of a pain on their end or they'd want people to not abuse the system enough that you'd get a chance to have ONE restored item... ever...
---
Copy and pasted directly from the TOS:
---
    Promote, upload, transmit, encourage or take part in any activity involving hacking, cracking, phishing, taking advantage of exploits or cheats and/or distribution of counterfeit software and/or Virtual Currency or virtual items. In an effort to continuously improve the Services, You and other players discovering exploits, cheats, cracks or other inconsistencies are required to report them to ZeniMax
---
Notice the last sentence? They were literally following the TOS set out by bethesda.
---
I’ve got about 29 saved so far- when I get to 40 I’m having an auction!
---
#FUCK BETHESDA
---
# FUCK FALLOUT 76
---
Here is an easy one Beth, even tied to your beloved mtx, please snap out a fix quickly, even a small apology, or joke at your own expense. Anything really.
---
You don't have to pay extra money for a private room in Death Stranding.
---
Amen to that! Well said my friend. 
---
I wish you the best.
---
Bethesda is owned by Zemimax which is private, so you are correct. There are still probably some investors, but it is probably more the upper management side of things causing issues.
---
Does it still show up when you drop stuff? The bag doesn't show in the Atom Shop, but it still shows up whenever I drop something
---
thanks dude, i'll call them up
---
 You may not (a) distribute, publicly perform or display, sell, transmit, publish, edit, reproduce, sublicense, rent, lease, loan or otherwise transfer any Game, Software, and/or Content, including without limitation any access keys; (b) modify, adapt, reverse engineer or decompile the Software, or otherwise attempt to derive source code from the Software 
---
Check the last sentence
---
Notice the last sentence?
---
I wouldnt mind if that were the case nut im back to sack lunches 😥
---
Refusing to report bugs and apply pressure to Beth helps you even less
---
It isn't even that the server was laggy though, I'm pretty sure this was the Tesla/Shotgun bug where doing too much damage with these weapons specifically manages to fuck up damage completely and ends up completely rendering ranged damage useless, I can kill things with my melee just fine still.
---
Reading memory isn't any of those things, do you even know what decompiling a exe is? Looking at the memory is none of those things notice "source code"? 
---
Read the full sentence, not just the part you want to hear, it says don't reverse engineer the game to try to derive the source code.
---
Looking at memory is doing none of those things. They were literally following the rules of the TOS since the TOS says they are REQUIRED to report the bugs.
---
And besides, I know a few dataminers myself and they don't have to use cheat engines. They are not banned just so you know
---
Yeah, looking up memory isn't trying to derive the source code of the game. LOL
---
Yeah, I agree, wow is beyond dogshit.
---
You're making a dishonest argument.  
---
First there's a reason atom shop issues get solved faster, because there's a paper trail involved when you're making those purchases.  If you buy something and you're not finding it unlocked in game they can look at your account, see the purchase and then figure out what went wrong.  That's a totally different situation from someone claiming they had a weapon and them having to go through their logs and files or whatever else they would need to restore an item they might not even be able to verify you ever had in the first place.
---
Second there's a reason people don't get replies to bug reports... because that's not something most game companies usually do in the first place.  You report a bug, they have that report... that's the end of the transaction here.  If you're dealing with a bug that just popped up from a recent update and was never encountered before then MAYBE their tech team will try to contact you to get extra details on what went wrong... but for your average bug report that's been submitted by a bunch of people?  They have all the information they need.
---
ROFL, obviously you don't or they'd tell you you are dumb for thinking datamining this game is "trying to derive the source code". LMAO
---
bought it and i love it 
---
ill make a review once the months up
---
Then why did they have to resort to using cheat engines? There are tools out there that allow you to datamine games. Why cheat engines?
---
Idiotic statement. 76 needs to be more whacky and fun and not lifeless.
---
How are you only fucking realising this shit now. You have then hundreds of dollars for a useless piece of shit
---
Isn't Bethesda now a publicly traded company? Ever since Skyrim they've been upping the ante on quality bullshit.
---
You can get a few as reward for arktos event
---
I've tried doing it on public event twice now. Both times the "start the experiment" step failed to show any quest marker to follow to start. The first time, somehow it started, and crashed mid-way. We'd already lost one creature, so whatever.
---
The second time, only me and my partner showed up, and we couldn't figure out how to start the experiment before time ran out. Partially because we haven't explored the area at all, and partially because those fucking assaultrons shred me for breathing.
---
this would break the engine into her parts
---
Why would they use cheat engines then? There are datamining tools out there why not use that instead?
---
Because it is one of the most commonly used program for viewing memory, and is open source and free.
---
No when I see trash I just never look in that direction again. This guy has to learn he was playing stupid games and he was going to win stupid prizes. The game is terrible and everything about it makes me sad. The entire clusterfuck that is that game would make any Fallout fan cry and never want to play it. It's making fun of Bethesda as a company and as a game dev.
---
But there is no argument. It seems like you're agreeing with me. In short, atomic shop tickets are answered quicker than game bug tickets.
---
I didnt reply to the OP to have or start any kind of argument or debate, just presenting information that I've observed through this sub. I even explained that I have never submitted a ticket for anything.
---
I used to love 76, i defended it constantly when it was coming out because i thought it was a great game and people just didnt understand that it was more of a survival game. Update after update Bethesda proved to me they are completely out of touch with the community and only see us as something they can exploit. Which is a real shame, the 76 community was one of the best communities in a game that i've ever encountered, especially in a survival game. I met more nice players than the 4-5 bad ones.
---
I tried to come back to the game about 2 months ago and i quickly realized it was the community i missed, not the game itself and Bethesda has only been driving people away.
---
Because it is open source and free, and been used for memory viewing for many many years. That is like asking why someone uses google chrome over firefox. Mostly it is down to what program the person already knows.
---
Oh so you used a cheat engine that's most commonly used and free? Thus you don't deserve a ban? lol good thinking there
---
They get hated by a huge part of the community for "ruining a franchise" every time they release a game because they change so much.
---
Snap. Still waiting here
---
Where in the TOS does it say viewing memory is against the TOS?
---
I've got the TOS pulled up, so please point out where that is against the rules.
---
Wastelanders is vapourware mate - it will *never* drop.
---
Open source and free cheat engine that is lol
---
This doesn't happen on public servers, I have an exploit that I call "making legendaries" that nets me as many 3* legendaries in a certain area of the game on the same server for hours, there has never been a server that has ever prevented legendaries from spawning...Im talking like 50 3*s an hour at least.
---
Seems as though this is an intentional measure to keep hardcore farming to a minimum on a private server.
---
No they aren't listening and they don't care. They have shown that over and over. As silly as this sounds the relationship fans have with the company feels like an abusive relationship with someone deceitful and manipulative 😂😂 so unless you have a way to make them more money ,they don't care ☹️
---
There was a major security breach recently that dataminers found and reported. It is why they did an emergency patch on Saturday. Look up what eckserah and aten_ra say about it. They are both trusted members of this subreddit and the issue is the launcher was sending login info and password as clear text over the internet.
---
So they very well could have had their account stolen through that breach.
---
Where in TOS does it say you can use cheat engines?
---
Wrong, just last week there was a major flaw that was reported and required them to send out an emergency patch on saturday due to security flaws in the log in system.
---
Me, love it.
---
Only paid for 1 month, will be paying for a full year.
---
It's made by literally the same company, the two guys who were the project leads were the project leads on the original Fallout, and the dialog is just as smart and crammed with as many skill checks as NV.
---
Jesus Christ... argument has more than one meaning.
---
&gt; a reason or set of reasons given with the aim of persuading others that an action or idea is right or wrong
---
I'm not picking a fight with you.  I'm pointing out that you're trying to make an argument, that Bethesda prioritizes atom shop tickets over bug report tickets, based on the bullshit reasoning that Atom shop tickets get replies and results while bug report tickets don't.  My point being that atom shop tickets get those replies and results because they NEED TO in order to be resolved.  Once you submit a bug report there's no reply or instant fix not because they're ignoring you but because bug reports are not a two way conversation, you give them the report and it's either something they already have on file and are working on or it gets added to the pile... end of transaction.
---
"The criminal himself admitted he was wrongfully arrested...."
---
People still play this game?
---
No
---
You claiming Aten_Ra the guy bethesda flew down to texas to play NW before it released is lying? ROFL
---
They literally started unbanning the dataminers earlier today. So bethesda seems to agree the bans were a fuck up.
---
Want to try again?
---
Uh? WINDOWS had such a patch, not Bethesda. Where are you getting your info? There are a number of sites that track breaches of companies. Bethesda’s last failure was from their support ticket system. Just google it? 
---
Got a link for where you read this? I work at a data center so we all keep tabs on security breaches. None of the trackers I know said anything about a game company breach last week.
---
Oh, so the person banned was lying and actually did something wrong? I'm shocked!
---
The fact it doesn't say you can't. If a TOS says a program is against the rules they normally will say so. Literally nowhere in the TOS does it state using memory viewers is against the rules. 
---
Hell, if it was so against the rules why are they unbanning them already? LMAO
---
If only Pepperidge Farm made canned meat stew...
---
Open source and free memory viewer. Which doesn't violate any of the TOS rules which is why they have already been getting unbanned today. LOL
---
Fuck Bethesda at this point, I know there are those who work there and develop the game that are just as frustrated as we are, but its' too bad they aren't SPEAKING UP.
---
Directly from the people who reported it to bethesda, the dataminers:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dtbg1h/despite_not_having_played_fo76_in_months_they/f6w26zk/
---
Can you link me ? I can’t find anything about that. I need the tracker if there’s one I’m not aware of.
---
And check out their site. They discovered an exploit and verified it with one of their accounts and that's the account that got banned. Seems Bethesda is doing their job
---
Dont thats a good bug. Never have to defend and it never recurs
---
Go check out their website. They weren't banned for just datamining
---
Uh, no if you'd read many of them working on it were banned. Now some are slowing being unbanned.
---
Jesus christ you're ignorant lmfao
---
Does it come with skin cancer?
---
Done it once, but level 72. Would love to do it with yeah.
---
Here is info directly from the dataminers who found it and reported it to bethesda:
---
Nice try being a corporate whore
---
My guy if all you're gonna do is shit on people who like 76 then just leave
---
Ok? Do you have ANY confirmation?
---
What does data mining have to do with how the client transmits login info? Also, which login attempt? The client does a handoff. If you sit at the game first splash screen the credentials eventually fail and you can log in from directly in the game. Which credential handoff was being sent in the clear? This post you list is missing everything security related that would matter.
---
Got the specifics anywhere? Sending passwords as a text login is something Sony did 10 years ago, it’s not exactly a common problem anymore.
---
What website? I'm talking about eckserah and aten_ra's discord. The dataminers who were banned for reporting the exploit. I don't give a shit about map76, they had nothing to do with reporting this exploit.
---
They found an exploit and they tested it with their own accounts. Yeah that will get you banned
---
That is part of the TOS, they literally say you are REQUIRED to report exploits. Part of reporting a bug in software it to reproduce it so you can give that info in the bug report.
---
Have you not ever reported a bug in this game?
---
Just go and read what they had to say aight? This argument is meaningless
---
Considering people are getting banned for doing just that...
---
One is for when you drop stuff and the death one is for when you die.
---
Read what who has to say? I am not talking about map76, and eckserah already has stated they just reported the exploit to bethesda so it didn't blow up and be a huge mess.
---
At no time did I ever once mention map76, as I don't care about them. This is about them banning the dataminers for doing the right thing and saving their ass from a major fuck up.
---
Can relate, for me downfall started with F4 though. Frankly, I liked 76 way more that 4
---
You play skyrim every day?
---
I have the scrap collector and id say its trash, only buy it if you want a robot wandering around your camp making dad jokes.
---
I dont have the fridge but Id get that over the collector if you cant afford both(unless you want the dad jokes)
---
No they are getting banned for using cheat engine.
---
nope, she first spawns as a regular mob and then turns into a legendary. you can see this happening esp if the server is laggy. takes sometimes up to 5-10 seconds
---
Not by testing it themselves and getting caught. The thing is, these reporters got way too comfortable. You never test out exploits yourself
---
I think youre right, unfortunately only other weapons Ive been fortunate to farm were a JE1P lmg and a BE combat rifle (I forget what its last ability was).
---
It was a terrible idea, not as terrible as Survival mode though.
---
Server response times have been cut back, that's why there is more lag,freezes and they can't fix the jetpacks because the server doesn't respond and makes it feel like jetpacks have a delayed burst/launch...the server doesn't recognize you've hit a button or key and when it does it drains you AP and fusion cores trying to play catchup, this is the norm people are paying for now...
---
Bethesda literally tells you to before reporting the bug. They literally tell you to "try to replicate it so you can better report it".
---
*tin foil hat*
---
It's a "Springtime for Hitler" scenario.  Bethesda is actively trying to tank the game.  If no one's playing it, they don't have to keep the servers up and running, fix bugs, etc.etc.  
---
I'm guessing that Wastelanders is either a complete disaster, or doesn't actually exist.  If they can get the playerbase low enough, they can justify shuttering the servers and never releasing Wastelanders.
---
No. You just report them not reproduce that exploit yourself. You stupid? That will get you banned insta in other games.
---
You're part of the problem. No matter what they do, you keep playing. No matter how many bugs. You keep playing. If you buy anything from the microtransaction store, you're literally the reason any of this is happening.
---
whats the event called you keep mentioning about picking up bug parts? 
---
operation tidy the repeatable quest rewards 1 pemican after completion. which involves cleaning up toxic goo..
---
Ya op is the boomer
---
They literally tell you to try to replicate it to better report it. You obviously haven't ever done a bug report for this game.
---
Thanks
---
They become bigger cunts every day. What a damn waste of something I love by some dumb greedy pieces of shit.
---
Here is a better explanation of exactly what the "exploit" was:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dtbg1h/despite_not_having_played_fo76_in_months_they/f6x4z2g/
---
Whatever. If you people hate this game so much, idk why you are even here. I only come here to see if there is any news on wastelanders.
---
Thanks, I’ll check it out.
---
They don't tell you to replicate an exploit and then report it. You sure you talking about fallout 76? not fallout 4?
---
Those guys unveiled that Bethesda is basically putting *all* our passwords in text form without any kind of encryption, and that anyone with a cheat engine can see them. I'm sure that's the source of many of the posts I've seen here about hacked accounts.
---
And you blame these guys, when it's Bethesda who is putting your account at risk?
---
Aren't we talking about exploits here? They replicated an exploit and that got them banned. We can talk about bugs later
---
Yes they literally do, they say "please try to replicate the situation that caused it to see if it repeatable". You haven't ever reported a bug in this game. It is very obvious.
---
Exploit and bug ain't the same thing bro
---
Yes and the TOS tells them to report them and when you report something they always ask if it is "repeatable". You so obviously have never reported a bug or exploit in this game.
---
Remember this is the game they were begging people to explain to them how they were getting into the dev room.
---
You are picking a fight, hence the dictionary definition of argument.
---
So again, what is it that I said in my post that was incorrect, persuasive or in a direction that is right or wrong? Someone asked a question and I provided insight from what I have observed through this sub.
---
For clarification (and arguments sake) I do think Bethesda prioritizes Atomic Shop tickets based upon the fact that it's easier to track purchases individually and because a customer can be without the goods or their money. I also think responses to the community that submit bug tickets should be handled with more proactive customer service
---
You report an exploit through the bug tracker. Which they then respond back with "is it repeatable". Which means trying to replicate it.
---
Look if you were right, bethesda wouldn't be unbanning them. But they are, so obviously they didn't break the rules or they wouldn't be getting unbanned.
---
CDPR has been known to exploit and mistreat its workers, though. Corners are usually cut somewhere for the sake of profit... 
---
There are very very few companies without some skeletons in their closet, and the bigger they get the less likely they are to be as benign as they appear.
---
Yes toon = character. Now the fallout1st sub is account based 1 account 1 server, meaning swapping characters can always join the same server, "your" server. So you won't need anyone to "join on" to get back to the server your first character left.(stashed your items in an overseers box). It has worked for me. Nothing lost..sofar. be mindful that if you are not able to rejoin within a few min window you risk the server shutting down.
---
Lol
---
That is your experience. They never asked me no such thing
---
Your first sentence was a good way to let me know that arguing with you is pointless.
---
Basically the launcher was sending the log in and password as clear text over the internet on log in through the launcher. Which could be used to steal accounts.
---
Your answer would be yes or no or I don't know. Not something like 'okay I'll try it myself and let you know huehue' You out of mind to think they want you to replicate the exploit
---
I wonder why? You seem half literate and ignorant of most of the inner workings of this game and bethesda as a whole.
---
Anyways, if you were right they wouldn't be unbanning them if they broke the rules like you claim. Yet they are unbanning them, so obviously bethesda doesn't agree with your interpretation of their rules.
---
its called role play if I want someone to do something I say - hey if you go clear this site and bring me stuff i'll give you stuff
---
&gt; Or maybe it's so that they have all the information they need nicely given to them in a single email 
---
Not to take the other guy's side but you just described a lazy tech.
---
That why they are getting unbanned? Seems bethesda doesn't agree with your interpertation of their rules and they agree they weren't breaking them.
---
So keep bleating about how they broke the rules, yet bethesda has unbanned them due to them not considering it breaking their rules.
---
I have launched a confederacy against non-fo1st players as an Aristocracy.   
---
   
---
In other words: we are fallout 1st players.
---
That's why I think it is a privilege. Doesn't matter if you done good for the community, you done something wrong, you get banned
---
Here you go:
---
Devs don’t know what they’re doing, anti cheat code for cheat engine or HxD is literally just “scan system processes for popular memory executables” that’s it.
---
Use any other number of memory editors or DIY and you get a nuclear winter amount of hackers.
---
Because fuck free speech, right?
---
They aren't being punished, so they obviously didn't break the rules.
---
Majority of your comment history on this sub is nothing but negativity. If you feel that strongly and negatively about the game then maybe just leave the sub and stop playing??? Ez
---
So you're happy about someone getting privileges. Well, we all come from different backgrounds
---
My experience is the exact opposite. 
---
Solo worlds have shown me that adventure mode is bugged to shit at spawning enemies. Several areas spawn additional mobs as "backup" that don't spawn in adventure mode.
---
It isn't a privilege to not be banned when you didn't break any rules.
---
They are banned because they broke the rules and now Bethesda is doing them a favor.
---
Inb4 2FA as a fallout 1st feature.
---
They aren't banned, they were already unbanned, because they were wrongfully banned as they didn't break any of the TOS rules.
---
You broke the rules and Bethesda is doing you a favor by unbanning you

There's a very strong chance that login data is still sent  over SSL. That isn't at all a replacement for encrypting the credentials (for several reasons), but would make packet sniffing tools like Wireshark pretty useless, especially running outside the client where there's no knowledge of the encryption key.
---
Nope, nowhere in the TOS does it say using any memory viewing software is against the rules.
---
good one, very salty, very sad
---
What platform? I will pay 30k for a BE 50 cal lol
---
That's why I try to support new and smaller size companies when I can. The cycle typically starts of with good intentions of a good game then as the growth comes shifts towards making money
---
I’ve crashed 6 times on PC. I’m getting significant lag too
---
I love it. The price not so much, but it gets me away from assholes, or it's just a quiet world to enjoy when I don't feel like running into other players. So as steep as it is ($130 a year Canadian), it's worth it for my wants or needs.
---
They are banned because they broke the rules and Bethesda landed a privilege
---
What rule in the TOS did they break? Nowhere in the TOS does it say memory viewers are against the TOS.
---
TOS does say Zenimax has the right to suspend, restrict, terminate your account
---
Since you like your TOS so much, Zenimax has all the rights to suspend or terminate your account. It's on the TOS
---
Yes to the former even though it doesn't feel like it most of the time. No to the latter because they will just monetise it and sell it back to us.
---
People were banned because they saw an exploit and intentionally used it before reporting it. They weren't banned for saying "hey, machine gun sounds still loops." Please do not spread misinformation.
---
Yes but the perk comes from the chemo after losing your hair, you become more aerodynamic when you fight.
---
I suggest you go to the shooting range and fire a so called "silenced" Barret. Bonus points if ear protection won't be used.
---
Yes if you break rules. Which they didn't.
---
Yes, but they didn't, as they are unbanned because they didn't break any rules. LOL
---
That's why I say they were given privilege
---
Which they did
---
I see thanks, I'll get the second one when I have the coins to do so for loot
---
What rule?
---
76
---
I don't expect a shill to understand that what they were doing was simply check if the exploit was real to report it, instead of wasting Bethesda's time in case it was just fake.
---
You could say the same for every single person playing the game today zenimax is giving them the privilege of not terminating their account for no reason.
---
To add to your list, top o my noggin’ 
---
Blue: pump action shotgun, 45 sub machine gun
---
Green: 10 mil sub
---
Except someone actually broke the rules
---
No exploit
---
Buddy I got bad news for you about this sub
---
Reading memory isn't an exploit.
---
Thank everyone for participating and shut down the servers.
---
Because people can't be angry and critical about more than one thing.  Nope, you have to stop being upset about Fallout 76 so that you're allowed to be upset about something else!  There is a limit after all...
---
Yeah soldier 76 is struggling a bit. To be fair though solder 76 has been struggling for a while. Soldier 76 is kinda irrelevant when most of the cast has better damage and mobility then soldier 76. At least he has a cool jacket with the number 76 on the back.
---
All I have to prove is that Zenimax has the rights to ban people and it's written on the TOS so that's proven. You have to prove they didn't cheat, which you didn't
---
No, it makes you upset which leads to you declaring you dont believe me regardless of your actual opinion because I've made you feel bad so of course retaliation in kind is needed.
---
 It isn't about whether I'm truthful or not at that point because you just care about removing the cognitive dissonance you are experiencing over my statements. And the simplest way to do that is to simply come to the conclusion they aren't worth your time, or you just decide they are wrong.
---
If you are going to be dishonest to others, at least be honest to yourself or you become an open book for any that know how to turn your pages.
---
The people who actually work on the game probably hate the people telling them to do stupid shit as much, if not more, than us
---
Can't decide wether to up or down vote that one. Guess I am a little concerned that might be true?
---
How is CLIENT crash related to NETWORK infrastructure?
---
Not really, it would be really inefficient to have to sort through emails to find the info they need. These people probably receive hundreds of emails a day.
---
No they don't. I really don't get why you think I have to understand all your overreacting. You don't replicate an exploit and devs don't ask you to in the first place
---
Hope you're ready for Bethesda to ban your account for back charging a digital purchase.
---
I roleplay it, so, my explosives expert goes all the way. All grenadier, all demolish expert, faster fire grenade launcher and a padded bikini. I have 4 other characters to go non-explosive. 
---
However, I happen to have a bloodied explosive 50. Cal. To be honest, the weapon does not take advantage from it. Your damage wont come from those explosions.
---
Dark Todd Howard give me a new wastelanders trailer.
---
Im not defending Bethsda I'm Defending this guy high lvls giving loot has happened to me almost Everytime I play with my low lvl characters. Your daft bruv.
---
im fully ready for that shit at this point
---
Lol. They are not going to show their faces around here to answer actual questions.
---
That's just AAA gaming companies.  Still plenty of good, ethical companies that actually care about their customers out there.  You just have to look beyond the big names.
---
Fallout First First. Itll be more prestigious and cost twice as much. Same benefits however.
---
Those weapons which can't be perforating otherwise, such as revolvers, laser rifles, pump and two barrel shotguns, etc.
---
To be fair they fixed the fallout 1st scrapbox issues very fast, I've never heard of the tent just vanishing and since those few early posts haven't heard anything about the worlds not being private because of looted stuff etc..
---
He wants his money back because the product is not as advertised but fallout 1st is exactly what it advertises. Is it way too expensive? Hell yeah!
---
Should it exist in its current form? Hard no.
---
Imagine everyone getting a month, spending the "free" atoms, and then asking for a refund.. No need to buy atoms ever again.
---
This guy was screwed over by Bethesda no doubt, and should not have an account banned when he actually helps to solve bugs. But most of his other complaints are not really valid.
---
If you’ve got a friend, and that friend tells you “don’t bother, I’ve spent loads of time on this and it’s just not worth it”, what are you gonna do? Now while content creators aren’t friend-level for all their followers, there are still a lot of followers who take what these individuals say seriously, and agree with them. Mr. Beast is a content creator. Now over 11 million trees are being planted, largely due to his influence. If you wanna get technical, you could argue that actors and other various celebrities are content creators. They’ve made plenty of change. Donations, movements, inspiration, all sorts of positive (and negative) things have been done because of content creators. 
---
I’m not saying that someone who datamines a videogame is anywhere near as influential as the people I’ve mentioned before, but when they create a popular tool within a community, when they become known, people in that community take note of when they’re displeased. And that community is what matters here. This person isn’t trying to change the world, this person has a valid argument against a very poorly executed venture, and others who are involved in that venture are listening. These are the people that matter to the developers, these are the people that can ruin their reputation, and these are the people that the company should aim to serve.
---
Yes there is. Bethesda will take the good QoL suggestions and make them an Atom Shop item, costing more Atoms than earnable from weeks of farming.
---
So technically, the point is to give them more money?
---
&gt;3) bethesda as an entity did not ban him, whoever controls the cheating or exploit monitoring did
---
They were acting on behalf of Bethesda. Anytime you are on the clock you are your company. Working customer service makes me not only my company, I am the literal voice of the company I work for. 
---
The employee was within guidelines, or a policy or a toolkit given to them by Bethesda, until Bethesda says otherwise. That means it was done on behalf of, in accordance with, Bethesda.
---
Its a video game. Let it go. Move on. The zeitgeist has been recorded in the annals.
---
No but I can whip your ass in person if you would like
---
The guys who made halo also made destiny; doesn't make it a successor.
---
I defended this game a lot during the short time I played it. All the way up until I hit that wall and most of the people I had befriended in the world did too.
---
Thing is, I didn’t get to communicate much with those people anyway since I was on PC. That meant I had to use Bethesda’s launching platform and not Steam. Because of that, we had no way to use text communication in game.
---
You could say it was our fault for not making a discord server to communicate on, but we were all just casual players who joined each other’s voice chat when on. Funny, Xbox and PS4 have party chat - whereas Bethesda made PC players launch from their app and not steam. This is what really killed it for me, since they didn’t think to implement messaging between friends in that launcher. I could have gotten many more months had the PC port not been so lazy.
---
Explain how? Also, doesn't exist.
---
Keep wasting your time here. Definitely don't play Outer Worlds, Fallen Order, or any of the dozens of other amazing games recently out. Remember, Bethesda loves you.
---
I'm going to need more info on this alleged exploit that you've found so that I can tell you whether it's working or not on private servers. :-P
---
Random ass ...I’ve done the scorch beast five more times gotten nothing but crap I just got a Tear one pipe pistol good against Mirelirks yeah yippee Bethesda is really doing it right!
---
Save em and pick hidg cap or refrigerated 1st. Excellent situational tools. Do Stings and things everyday you will get there.
---
If you didn’t notice at first, look in the upper right.
---
They all work for both. You choose how u want to use them.
---
All of your examples to why his complaints aren't valid are all based out of personal experience, you keep essentially saying: "I haven't experienced these problems so they cant be that bad".
---
Except for him, they were. You dont get to decide his expectations nor his reaction. Just because you find the incredibly sub-standard services acceptable doesn't mean he does too.
---
did you not like my answer the first time?
---
Only problem with that is I don't like every mutation and would suffer stat wise for small damage gain, I prefer Furious weapons over any other, only requirement is to stay on target. Only negative is you start with base damage, but that's what drugs make up for...
---
that sounds exactly like what happened. she attacked a random guy because he was in "her" power armor and using emotes... wow
---
Instigating extra limb damage low Vats usage western revolver. It makes a beautiful sound, it headshoots most enemies and cripples the rest. Wont kill the Sbq, but Will take care of everything around her.
---
Worse than that, they’re short-sighted businessmen. 
---
You see it a lot these days. Person comes in and immediately cuts costs and raises prices. They make their quarterly bonuses and maybe even an end of year KPI bonus worth a couple million. They then move on before it all falls over, and claim it was their departure that the company couldn’t recover from, not their short-term practices. 
---
Get what you can, while you can, then get out.
---
He is gone, he has 5 other non banned accounts. If he wanted to keep going he would and them unbanning him at this point probably wouldnt change anything.
---
I picked it up after the free week for half off, talked three friends into getting it and we've all had a lot of great fun with it. Def got our money's worth, def won't be putting any more money into it
---
Are you asking what is going on in general?
---
Remember to voice your opinions with your money as well!! 
---
FO3 got me through a really gnarly knee surgery, so I logged a lot of hours on that game and it's expansions. i bought the following elder scrolls and FO4. Luckily i was busy with life at the time FO76 was released so i didn't buy it immediately after release but still followed it. i did eventually buy it a couple of months after release when life/graduate school slowed down and returned it the next day. Granted I've only been a fan/customer since FO3, so I Dont have the time most of this community has invested in Bethesda but i will NOT buy anymore of their products until they show they want to put out a quality product and not to just make a cash grab. Same reason I've boycotted activision and EA games. 
---
Show them we mean business we can talk all shit we want but if we keep buying the product they keep making money and can keep pushing bullshit like this out. It's hard to not be apart if something that you enjoy but sacrifices need to be made to make positive changes!
---
Our voices are being heard to some extent ie D &amp; D ”regretfully leaving star wars,” rian Johnson ”not having a known date for trilogy” studios are taking notice.
---
Because Zenimax can’t monetize it
---
No I don’t kiss ass to Bethesda especially with a broken game like this you can keep on kissing but I’m through!
---
I can't even tell which of the bitching posts are serious any more 0.o
---
You can keep kissing but there’s does ass I’ve played this game long enough to know it’s crap!  Definitely not rewarded for the hours and hours you play this game it’s bullshit you’re just an ass kisser
---
Sucks to be you, you’re just getting bad rolls. 
---
Don’t let the door hit ya
---
Sure thing tough guy.
---
Or could also do it like junkies perk, cap it at 5 mutations just like its 5 addictions
---
Yeah...this is awful. 
---
But have you tried Outer Worlds yet? That may heal your broken heart.
---
that was a mistake on my prt for not wording that last part correctly, i was in a hurry
---
what i meant was that there was no way the people monitoring the cheating for bugs and exploits with the power of banning to effectively communicate to the support team that this one guy is testing bugs on 6 different accounts, therefore bethesda as a whole should be blamed for a miscommunication between departments
---
Part of it came from a Cut Content dataminer's youtube video showing where he found the models and textures. As for the lore aspects those he apparently got in a Q&amp;A. I'll try to dig it up.
---
They would give a reason as they have for accounts banned for cheating. Unless they charged back purchases, etc. This is an entire Bethesda account ban. You're ignorant of how bethesda handles things. This wasn't a result of cheating in FO76 most likely.
---
I’m asking what is Map76
---
Love it.
---
Damn... They put poison in the blue M&amp;M's. Guess I'll just have to be extra careful when I'm eating M&amp;M's now so I don't eat a blue one.
---
No you dingus. Just stop eating the poisoned candy.
---
I did get a BE minigun once. That's the only one I remember so the rest of the drops must have been garbage.
---
I'm assuming a more interactive model of the world map for 76.
---
You’re ignorant for making that comment. You don’t know what I know. I didn’t say it was cheating... I said it was a troll. It is. Just stroking the flames of how bad Bethesda is... OP knows why they were banned. They may not admit it but Bethesda isn’t in the habit of banning people for no reason. To add: I’m not saying all Bethesda’s reasons are good reasons, but OP knows what they did to get banned.
---
They already said that the settlements will be instanced, so that decisions like that from other players don't affect you.
---
Quick not on you saying this towards the corporate/division folks the sad truth is most people who are "corporate" "division" leads are not even folks who have a background in there industry case and point I have worked for very large companies and met there head business people one for instance is a VP of the east coast for a company he came in through a friend was in the biz less than a year whT he do before that got fired as Lowe's store manager.... alot of these companies don't  care so much about high up talent just the pay rate/cut they will work for so it stays looking legit even though they don't know wtf is going on around them people below them help them make decisions but get payed 20/30% on average of there yearly salary every year sad time to be alive in all honesty
---
I would suggest a solid Lever Action, Hunter/sniper, or Fixer with Instigating. I run that sort of build with a heavy focus on Critical Hits via VATS, so, for me, VATS Damage is essential for the second Legendary perk. If you stick with that sort of build having a lever AA or Vampires with FFR as the second perk is helpful for non-stealth encounters.
---
Another option, for non stealth combat is a Railway with FFR, but it has a heck of a recoil, which can get rough when not in VATS. The one I use with VATS is a Two Shot modded with the Auto Barrel. What you lose in perk bonuses, you make up in pure damage. The recoil isn't as much of an issue, because the enemies are usually much closer. Throw on a VATS Critical Damage as a second perk, and you can down a scorchbeast in under 30 seconds. 
---
I, personally, stay away from Explosive stuff all together. The perks you invest in it can be better utilized elsewhere.
---
It's worse. You empty their health bar to see it bounce back to almost full again.
---
I think you're getting "spiritual successor" and "sequel" confused.
---
They won't  act right is the sad part there slipping so far so quickly it's  the fucking blitzkrieg on a great company that began slow in later years but now there full steam ahead rebalancing the company to there benefit and not ours unlike the way it was
---
It's rare to get something good off the Queen, but it is good for Scrip, and then you can pick whatever tier you want.
---
Gay
---
I play so many smaller games that would otherwise be completely dead without players like the Map76 creator finding ways to keep it fun and alive for the fans. If a game is struggling it NEEDS dedicated people like this to survive. Getting rid of the people willing to put a lot of free time into making your game more fun to play for others is monumentally stupid.
---
Stop.playing.the.game...
---
Im looking forward to showing them all whos boss around here
---
Not understanding why yall are still trusting this company with your money.
---
Just for fun, with no real consequences, I presume. NPCs and any grudge they might get against you will definitely die with a simple server hop, just like Whitespring bots don't remember you killing them. 
---
Parallel pickpocketing, maybe.
---
Not to brag or anything, but I got a BSS+1 Strength from the queen about 5 months back, ever since it’s just been scrip material
---
15,000 caps for it and a tinfoil hat.
---
The Fixer is really nice for stealth builds. A friend runs a silenced Fixer with Furious and Faster Fire-rate as a stealth commando. Great stuff.
---
Can I get an account?
---
What are you people even arguing about.  Having a game company tell you what other programs you can have and operate on your computer is fucking insane.
---
You guys should replace "Cheat Engine" with "Excel" just to make sure your arguments and statements are sound.  If that change suddenly makes a statement sound retarded, then it was retarded to begin with.
---
It was a joke referencing the quest in Fallout 3. I'm well aware of the bug, until recently two of my characters only used shotguns. I respec'd one to Heavy weapons a couple weeks ago, partly because of the bug. I frequently use twice as many shells than I should to kill enemies, it's dumb. I rarely play on that character now, it's my new heavy weapon character and my unarmed character, the latter only existing because of the power armor bug that lasted for months. Funny how I have to change my entire play style to avoid bugs in this game.
---
A friend and I both bought the game at launch. We were insanely excited for it because we're from Lewisburg, WV and it's so cool seeing the area we grew up in featured in a game. Shortly after we started we instantly regretted the purchase. The game just didn't feel right. When Wastelanders was announced we both got really excited and started planning on getting back into it again once the update dropped so maybe the game would feel different. Then this Fallout 1st shit happened and we both instantly lost interest in the game as a whole.
---
I find railway rifle very satisfying, so I think I'll stick with your suggestion! I'm enjoying using lever-action too (my first one dropped not 2h ago).
---
What about energy weapons? Any of them worth the investment (perk-wise)?
---
Focused pistol builds are stronger than focused shotgun builds. My gunslinger is waaaay more deadly than my shotgunner. 
---
 deadly
---
I jumped outta my seat when I got the backpack skin and bear arms back to back. Still trying to get that stimpack diffuser though
---
Instigating Lever is pretty much mandatory if you’re not bloodied. 
---
Then get a Handmade, Fixer or Combat Rifle.  Instigating, Anti Armor, Vampires, etc are all good options.
---
Shut your cry baby asses up already. U realize theres like next to 0 people who give a fuck.
---
Problem is: resources are mostly useless. 90% of stuff is basically meaningless to collect
---
Furious wouldn’t be great for a Rifleman.  It’s not great for a commando either, but it’s better.  It’s a great gun for the SBQ tho!
---
Didn't you say you were going to quit like a month ago?
---
This is perfect. I never took a workshop if it wasn’t for atoms aside from early days of the ammo plant. If they didn’t just give scrap and gave items like Nukas or meds I’d claim em.
---
You sound like a very cool guy.
---
You don’t need to put any points into Demo with an exploding weapon, and if you do, I wouldn’t put more than one point into it. 
---
Exploding is good for a rifleman build because it gives you more damage on that first shot, which hopefully 1-shots the mob. VATS50 is great for boss killing in a single shot.
---
I have almost 1,000 hours in 76. I am a 39 year old mom and married and both the hubs and I have our own  first account and did the year for each. Yes we bought two years and are so happy we did! I freakin love it and so does he. 🤷🏻‍♀️❤️
---
Only seen diffuser once, Formula P multiple times, Bear Arms 2-3, Heavy Mod 1x.  No backpack on the main.  Bought Puncturing plan.
---
I have backpack on an alt of course.
---
I created this build before they added the AA to Energy weapons, and I didn't want to respec after it, so I don't have a lot of experience with them. For me, I am satisfied with staying Ballistic...I do, however, carry one rifle specifically for Robots with Troubleshooters to make up for it.
---
Gain some effing resiliency.
---
Because it can take years to properly reverse engineer a server, not to mention the legal issues with running such server.
---
What does instanced mean?
---
I could see that about Explosive, but I'm on shotting most non-badass enemies anyways. I spend that extra point in either one of the Critical luck based perks, or in an extra level of Concentrated Fire as insurance incase I miss.
---
So far the things I know they added from our suggestions were: Refrigerators, repair kits displays, robots in our camp, and camp tents.
---
They did let us sink our crops deeper in the ground, that's free at least.
---
Another suggestion they acted swiftly was how much the **atom shop cutout turned everyone off.**
---
I played it for a full day today and got it :)
---
 [Yesss](https://i.imgur.com/ytckcjv.jpg)
---
Another Bethesda ass kisser obviously everyone knows Bethesda monitors reddit
---
And the military paint for the X01
---
Thanks for your reply yes obviously the chances of getting anything decent are super super rare considering the hours upon hours someone spends playing this game Bethesda just wants your money these people on Reddit that are kissing ass to Bethesda aren’t going to get anything they’re stupid
---
For sniping, an instigating or bloodied rifle of any kind Will do (choose according to your outfit/style: a cowboy should not use a Gauss rifle, nor a BoS soldier should fire a lever action). For mob control at shorter distances, combat rifles and handmades offer the best ammo capacity-fire rate-power combos.
---
The idiot above you is not a cool guy he’s a Bethesda ass kisser
---
What type? Is it the clean variant?
---
I was so nervous when I stood at that door, wondering if he'd be alive...
---
No it’s the dirty one
---
No one is forcing you to play this game OR post here. I'm sure your constant complaining is extremely helpful.
---
The door won’t hit me and you to have to be pretty big boy to knock me down
---
With an IE Lever you can 1-shot up to a level 68 3* Supermutant.
---
Ah that isn't worth anything it has static spawn in the space station. Sell it to a vendor it yields a hundred caps for the helmet and suit.
---
Third map is probably the Berkley/Harpers Ferry map. Charleston, since it differs much in size, might be for special games later on, either with a smaller amount of players or team play.
---
Exactly 99% of the time it’s crap which is what this game is about crap Bethesda just once everyone’s money they’ve let greed take a good game and turn it into crap
---
How much are the clean ones worth?
---
I know it’s not just me these dumbasses that keep downing me they’re idiots they’re just Bethesda ass kissers
---
Sorry was on my mobile, and the thread was huge, my bad!  
---
  
---
Yes some of the Dataminers and bug people were banned, but no I don't think they were banned for reporting bugs, **but the timing of the bans were VERY VERY bad** all things considered.
---
Enclave Bunker has the parts. You get em if you complete the brotherhood quest line.
---
A few thousand I've seen. Price went down a bit because it was in the mischief event loot pool.
---
I noticed that.
---
Also when you Jump and know for a fact there is no way they should have hit you.
---
And "Slap"  with it goes half your health Bar.
---
Also when you encounter a Bullet Sponge Colonel Gutsy,and it takes like 30 Shots to destroy,yet it is not even Legedery,just the same as the others.
---
A couple of Ghouls at Whitespring are the same.
---
Another  Bethesda asskiss...no one  expects to get a good roll every time my friend but 50+ times?
---
Another Bethesda ass kisser
---
I have one and never thought of it being worth anything. Thanks
---
Which is kind of the point. While our characters might not know it, we as players know it will be almost 100+ more years until the world finally start to rebuild properly. We have a mission, but as players we know that missions is bound to fail.
---
I want to get all the plans but I’m too casual with the game to grind it out. I end up just trading for the plans if I end up with any good weapons.
---
That’s great congratulations man it’s good to hear somebody’s getting something
---
Yes, I recommend you put a ton of points into luck.  Luck has many of the best perks for a VATS/Crit Rifleman build.
---
With my non-explosive Instigating lever I can do that too...and glowing ghouls, and other non huge enemies. Plus, the Explosive effect drains the weapon condition so much.
---
Yes, Australia is considerably more expensive but salaries do not compensate it. Our salary to expense rate is wayyy out of wack.
---
Oh she’s found a legendary item for me today an f-ing tier 1 pipe pistol!!! Yipeee
---
Hahaha. I threw that SOB on the effing ground
---
Sometimes people like to do things besides server hop but also still get materials...
---
You shouldn’t be able to 1-shot a 3* Supermutant with a regular lever.  You should be capped around 1,800 damage, unless you are playing at low health and using unyielding, nerd rage, etc.
---
Congrats
---
They are idealistic and naïve. That's what it comes down to. I had a friend like this who put zero critical thought into anything he bought, whether it was phones or videogames. I don't know what the circumstances are for OP, but my former friend grew up rich and never had to really think through the consequences of his decisions, so he just never learned that his money had value and that he could be using it better elsewhere. But some people just spend emotionally. 🤷
---
You use your $300,000 to buy mats on Ebay?
---
Well good luck I think it’s just crap that bethesda only cares about money
---
My prediction is they’ll offer a “fallout first members early access period” for the update, to try and sell more fallout first memberships. That way they’re not breaking another promise, just bending it a smidge.
---
You’re not alone.
---
On the SBQ's corpse, as all the other plans. Some are just MUCH rarer than others.
---
Did you not consider that he was saying he has 2 pieces with sent, and 3 pieces with cav, for example?
---
Well I’m not kidding about anything I’ve said these guys that don’t like what I’ve said they’re just kissing Bethesda’s ass    Sorry to hear about that on your end you may play this game for a year and never get the plans you want that’s how crappy this freaking game is
---
It means it’s an area unique to you and your team, so if another person or team enters the same area you won’t see or interact with them, and they won’t see and interact with you
---
I do, but you do gotta hit em in the head...at least the first one as I use adrenaline. After the first, it can be gut shot after gut shot.
---
What are you hitting for on a head shot (not using a VATS crit)?  It should be 1,800 at the high end.
---
Its a bug, so count on it being fixed, for both Raider and Ultracite.
---
I don't think getting hit with a paper bag would be effective.
---
You will have your own version of the settlements, and others will have theirs. Just like if you were playing alone, but only in those places.
---
Lol accounts have been compromised. Being banned doesn't mean OP did anything. Calm down
---
PC player?  If so, NW is a total shitshow from what I understand because of all the cheating. It's much better on console because the hacks don't work on them.
---
The only problem with this is literally every player over 50 runs mutations. They would need to make to so accuracy or fire rate lowered or these would wipe put every other prefix across the board.
---
That sounds about right, but I don't play with the damage text on as I find it distracting. All I know is, to paraphrase, it just works.
---
I would bet bethesda is probably gonna unban them but we wouldnt hear about it cause hate train.
---
Apparently more than one persons account was banned for testing the exploit (it says so in that post). Why take that risk, unless you need 2 accounts to do it? Plus if they already knew Fo76 scans for CE and other memory scanners, couldn't they have taken steps to avoid getting flagged by using one that isn't checked for or disguise CE somehow.
---
Good. Let this game die.
---
I think you're confused.  
---
MODUS in the Whitespring Bunker only sells X-01 mod plans and the BoS questline only teaches you how to craft the Ultracite armor itself, not the mods.
---
I am having to reevaluate all my weaponry effects.
---
A Nocturnal  Death Claw Gauntlet with  90% Less weight dropped for me today.
---
I modded it with the extra Claw Ready to sell in the vendor
---
 I noticed though it was 700 + damage at night i mean seriously wtf ?
---
I have been running with a Bloodied DCG that puts out 560/590 + and i am running with minimum Health to get that..
---
I have been binning all the Nocturnal Drops thinking they are useless.
---
It is even more lethal than a Bloody Meat Hook.
---
Shreds Glowing Ghouls in one swipe.
---
Bloody Meat Hook by Day/Nocturnal Death Claw Gauntlet by Night it is then.
---
Going to start paying more attention to nocturnal stuff.
---
Ohhh sweet
---
I suck at it, I sneak too much and dont engage in firefights. But i also stopped playing NW around Rank 65 because I realized I got almost NO exp if I die 3/4s into the match and it pissed me off...
---
Yeah, the Instigating Lever is a “game changing” weapon.  It almost makes Bloodied unnecessary...
---
Thanks!
---
Can't say thank you enough for all the work. It's a sad day indeed to see your efforts go. Best wishes to you.
---
I'm drunk so yes yes I am.
---
Yea 100% yes. My sneak commando is being spotted fucking constantly. Max every sneak perk, over 15 agility, max light frame, extra light armor loss and I can't talk anywhere without being spotted.
---
Are you literally shaking right now? Do you need a safe space?
---
I enjoy it a lot. It's pretty much the only game I play.
---
Maybe a behavioral psychologist that focuses on people slowing down and composing themselves.
---
Slow down! You're hunting not aimlessly running around like a chicken with it's head cut off. Crouch, wait, observe and move. It helps to be in third person to aim better. When you see someone don't engage at far distances try to be within 10 in game yards of that person and unload while concentrating  on your fire. Use drugs! If you see someone use drugs now then engage.
---
Same here. My escape artist sometimes doesnt work either (after waiting for the cool down). Some servers are worse than others though.
---
Absolutely. I was just doing meh damage until I got one of those. That, plus gun Fu, let's you clear an area in seconds.
---
Throughly enjoy it
---

---
Balls I made another mistake, I'll reupload this question with a mistake.
---
How easy to you think it is to just start up this server
---
So they never patched the "horde" event camping glitch huh
---
Quit playing this game
---
So you mean block them from the 76 menu? Or do you mean block them from your console's friends list?
---
Kicking a friend from a private lobby is already rude enough but I would like to try to salvage friendships when possible.
---
Yeah, this 25 minutes work for 272/14000 exp is ridiculous.
---
I’ve only ever found ultracite plans from the SBQ
---
I see this as well.  With my JE combat shotty with maxed perks and addictions, it does the same thing but the damage actually stays.
---
Scorchbeast queens
---
This!
---
Also on player vendors, since many sell the plans they get from the SBQ.
---
There is no way they could ever make a comeback. They could release amazing content and make this game perfect, and 99% of gamers would still refuse to try it on principle. Which is honestly a good thing, since it punishes devs for releasing shady cash grabs. But it sucks for the devs who finally did put the work in, in the end. 
---
Bethesda isn't trying to make this game a big thing anymore, it's already sold it's initial copies, flopped and is basically dead to them. It's just like Anthem at this point, they are sitting there VERY closely monitoring the income vs costs for the game running and will kill it as soon as it starts costing them money. 
---
They had to make a sub fee model to milk the remaining customers until they quit playing, because those customers are costing them more money than they are generating in server upkeep costs and minimal dev time. 
---
As someone who works in IT with developers daily, I can already tell you 100% the devs have been taken off this besides a skeleton crew (if that) and are being allocated to more profitable ventures. 
---
I hate to be negative about it, but Anthem is a pretty easy game to point to that's in a similar situation where as far as the $$$$$$$ greedy top dogs $$$$$ are concerned, it's dead and only costing them money. They don't care about company reputation, they are just out to make money. And if it remotely EVER starts costing more than it's bringing it, it's gotta go along with a few employees to make up for lost money
---
Yea honestly find any high level player with plans in the vendor I guarantee they have some ultracite plans. Most sell them cheap so please don’t buy for 500 caps each, someone else will sell cheaper. I never sell mine for more than 5 for instance
---
Last night I made it to final 4, with chameleon, and the circle was in Morgantown proper.  I hopped on a shrub and watched the other 3 and a SB battle it out.  Ran to a porch when the fire started to move, the other guy who survived soon ran up as well, not realizing i was there.  I could have meleed him he was close.
---
I unload with my combat auto rifle (mind you I’m auto rifle spec) and somehow he doesn’t die runs off the porch and kills me.
---
So don’t tell me you suck.  There’s plenty more people worse off than you!
---
You have to go to your friends list and block/unfriend them. I mean, if they're your friends you can probably just ask them to leave but that's the only way to force them to.
---
Queen but normally when I farm em I dont use ultracite pa so I give em away
---
I reached that point on the 6th release of Skyrim.
---
I’m not a fan of Gun Fu, but I’m on the PC.  It may be better for console players.  I don’t like the delay between targets, and I can tab more quickly through the mobs on my keyboard. I know some folks really like Gun Fu though.
---
I do a daily run these days for Acid from the springs, i collect about 16 a day.
---
At the end of the Week i  then do a run on Lucky Hole Mine for my Led.Then smelt it
---
In my opinion it is so much easier than setting up a Workshop ,and risking disconnection/griefers etc.
---
Yeah, zenamax also makes some of those decisions though, they own Bethesda and basically tell them what to, I still hate Bethesda more than I did before I saw this post but I can't imagine how much I would hate them if I saw this before I knew that zenamax made some of those decisions. I guess this this was one of my last strings for Bethesda, yes one of them because I have had multiple broken by them
---
Mostly I like the sleeker look, and due to the piece I had drop from the purveyor.  Haven't even seen a single piece of ComArmor with weightless and weapon reduction.  I'm also sitting on an arm and leg of marine armor with weapon reduction but no weightless, might also try to do a set of that as well.  Trying to find weapon reduction on unyielding/bolstering will be a pain so I'm skipping a bloodied build, would rather be a walking arsenal.
---
I've had bigger troubles with it in the past. Sneak commando is as stealthy as I can expect, but running bloodied/unyielding think my AGI is up around 24
---
Games as a service was sold to executives to actually be what we have now. A way to push out content faster with less testing required as it can be fixed later. Obviously said in a bit better way to make it sound like all the right things are in place to make the game successful.
---
There are some companies that do games as a service well and others that do not. However, when they sell the game they get their money and it is hard to distinguish success and failure. There isn't a go back button on this model. The only thing that we as consumers can really do is to not buy these games until they have had a chance to be out and mature.
---
There is one other thing that can be done, but it needs to get laws involved. Right now, there is a lot that is promised in a games delivery, but the laws don't really reflect the reality of getting what you paid for. We could champion for laws that help refunds occur for games and collectors editions that end up not being what we were sold. A game with an unstable server day one is common for new releases. A game with unstable servers every day all day is not. There is a lot to try and figure out, but we can't expect companies to do the right thing.
---
They go near weightless. Either caps at a bit above 90% or it doesn't count weapon mod weight additions.  I have 5 pieces of armor with the reduce by 20% so I can confirm that.
---
My stealth rifleman is basically almost useless now thanks to it.  I used to be able to solo vaults without being spotted
---
Yup, I sell them for 2-300 caps, but if someone asks nicely I will give them away for free if they are short on caps. I mostly have them in my vendor as public service for people needing the plans. I tried putting them up for 0 caps, but high level people snatched them up for free to sell them in their own vendors, so a slightly higher price seem to discourage that.
---
I am on ps4, and I get some people don't like the delay. I am getting old and slow, so it does help there. What I like is the feeling of John Wick-ing a whole room of enemies in rapid succession...plus the damage boost is nice when you're up against a larger enemy surrounded by underlings...Mirelurk Queens and much of Arktos, or the meat week events.
---
i dont like spawning in and me+30 or so people getting insta gibbed by jesus because he installed cheat engine or other hacks.
---
then again im a PC user
---
It means absolutely nothing. I say that exact phrase to customers all the time. What it means is I'm going to joke about it to the dev team and we'll make fun of you on Slack. 
---
Literally what most of my back and forth looks like with them is 
---
"Hey, dude on the front is insisting we add X feature and fix Y bug. I told him I'd forward it on to the dev team, so here you go"
---
"Lolno, that feature would require WAY too much back end work because it calls upon X table, and that bug is so minor that it isn't a priority" 
---
Like not even joking, that's pretty much an exact transcript that happens several times a week. I was going to screen shot some but couldn't find any without identifying info. 
---
Working in IT pretty quickly makes you jaded and lets you see through typical PR spiel and "I'm not doing that unless you pay me" dev jargon. 
---
Dev time is a VERY sought after resource, like 75-150+ dollars an hour sought after is how my company charges for any kind of customization or feature requests. So you report a bug and then they say "is this bug going to cost us 100+ dollars? If not, it's not worth fixing until the devs are through every single other thing they can possibly be used to do"
---
Yeah I’m older and have issues with my hands. I can’t even use a controller any more due to pain.  At least I can still enjoy playing on the pc for now. 👍
---
so 2 seconds more than bethesda worked on their "anti cheat" ?
---
Welcome to bethesda the only compagnie who never finish a game because they don't have the talent and the knowledge.
---
Insted they will make you pay for everything who should be free and make you finish their game.
---
And ppl still take defence for they're shit.
---
Huh, I’m going to check this out then. Much appreciated!
---
Same thing use to happen at Posieden energy.
---
I would go looking for them and never find them.
---
You have no choice but to stay near the Workshop or fail the Quest, and have to retake it.
---
Had a funny experience at Posieden  when all the Turrets started shooting at each other until they were all destroyed..I repaired them all then they all started firing at the Stash Box incessantly.Bwhaaa
---
mutations need more drawbacks tbh.
---
a stacking max health reduction would be a good start.
---
I don't use bloodied, but I do use Furious. It seems broken. Have a furious explosive pump, consistently does 1 dmg per pellet. VATS makes no difference either. Weird issue, as all of my other shotguns do far more damage.
---
Me if you are on ps4, hundreds of plans, used to do like 20 queens a day for months.
---
Just put away your junk or don't bother going into completely optional pvp?
---
Np 👍
---
I had that happen to me the other night too
---
It has seemingly been jumping a tad for me too
---
Why is this posted again?
---
Dang, well, glad never became a 1st member.
---
People need to starve the beast when Beth makes bad decisions.
---
Also, didn't creator figure out last time that if you spent ADAM they would screw you (I remember there was that lawsuit over the power armor headgear where using the free ADAM screwed you and you got nothing)
---
God speed, brother.
---
I haven't checked my Furious LA but it seems so far only my TSE LA is working properly. On top of that I've noticed some wight issues as well.
---
Make sure to check the containers at the Watoga station after a SBQ run, lots of people just dump their dupes in there (though, I doubt anyone will dump their calibrated shocks, since they're highly sought after)
---
i always figured mannequins became that reference as portrayed by fallout 4, they were everywhere even in places you'd question "why IS this here?"
---
You shouldn't have to run weight management perks after you've learned what weighs you down. I've run a 3 str character sine day one. I only bandolier 2 as a weight management perk because I like to keep thousands of rounds on me.
---
Your mom gets recorded in the annals.
---
If the Queen dropped a top tier weapon every kill people like me thousands of them.
---
Is it worth playing? Yes. Buying..... that’s relative. For what you CAN get out of it yes. For what you WILL get out of it... maybe. The game has horrible problem support with most patches causing more issues or breaking old fixes. Cheaters are rampant and prospering. Hell today I even found a way to guaranteed crash any server, even private. Can it be fun? Absolutely. So it’s entirely up to you as to how much money is worth the amount of fun, and to be ready in case this game never reaches the full potential you’re hoping for
---
You might be on to something here.
---
I had a bloodied [Minigun.You](https://Minigun.You) would have thought that thing would have been insane with low health and all the heavy weapon Perks.
---
Much to my surprise with low health and all the Heavy Gun Perks it was putting out 90 per shot.
---
An AAE Gatling Gun with Full health using the same Perks and Ammo was putting out 190/200 per shot.
---
I was really surprised by this.Hence why i got rid.
---
Also noticed tonight that a Nocturnal DCG puts out 700 + damage at night..This with having full health.
---
A Bloodied DCG puts out 590 + Tops with literally no health.
---
Are you accounting for radiation and did you by any chance get the high capacity backpack mod which will turn their measly 20 rads into a whopping 100+?
---
Its strong but so is its weakness. If you are at 30% health, it has a 45% chance to save you. Alternatively if you are at 31% health, you die instantly from strong enemies. Most of the time it works well, except for enemies like Gutsy's which have strong bullets, and Legendary Gutsy's with Anti armor bullets.
---
I haven't had any trouble seeing as I normally one shot them even the whitesprings nuked glowing ones
---
Super Mutants have definitely been updated with anti-Chameleon Vision.
---
They go right for you.
---
Akso If you listen to their dialogue,they even tell you they can see you.
---
That backpack mod does what now?
---
Depends if you like sitting on reddit arguing all day, leaving your playstion on for hours at a time and eventually turning the game off because you cant get any bullets or stimpacks
---
Strength 15 with Barbarian, Endurance 5 with ironclad, Charisma with either Bodyguards 3 and classfreak with Scaly Skin or Lone Wanderer 4, Agility 15 with Evasive 3, and Serendipity 3 make you so fucking tanky that at 10% health I can absorb an assaultrons full blast at point blank range and still kill it with a switchblade
---
Have dequipped all agility cards, exited pipboy, then re-equip?  I had a similar issue and it did the trick.
---
-60 energy and radiation. Most people don’t have any rad resistant armors. So you technically drop to -60 rad resistance. It doesn’t physically show in stats but by god do you feel it
---
That's a nice tank build.
---
Earlier today I was teamed with someone, and we decided to PVP each other. He used some legendary mr handy buzzsaw blade he got (suppressors) and I used my flaming chainsaw. I had nerd rage and serendipity both equipped, both maxed out, health was definitely below 20%. I killed him *every time* because both perks kept popping up. It was fucking insane
---
I kill everything with switchblades only. I main knifes. I can survive so much. I’ve never had so much fun
---
Yep. Their base attacks just kill me in 2 hits now all of a sudden. The rads themselves aren'r killing me (but I do get a bunch of them from the attacks).
---
I see what you did there.
---
What level, damage resistance level, etc do you have?
---
...dude, just stash your junk. Or don't PVP. I'm failing to see the problem here other than you failed to stash your junk prior to consenting to PVP
---
Idk how i missed that. This explains so much. Ty.
---
My main character is a Bloodied Heavy, but I lost perks to my trading. My second character is a Bloodied Pistol gunslinger (which I highly recommend), and my 3rd is going to be a Berserker Lifesaving Build which will uses chems, Revenant, High Charisma, Broken Life saving armor, and some of the perks you suggested. Berserkers is going to be so stupid fun.
---
If you can, get radiation plus legendary armors to combat it
---
Mu rig is a bit sub standard these day, but it never get that low....
---
Wouldn't recommend heavy guns in pvp
---
I’ve heard a few people say they don’t have issues. I’ve even heard where some get higher frames there. I’m not honestly sure what’s wrong
---
Ignoring the fact that Bethesda's incompetency is what makes the CE possible in the first place, providing even a single ban reversal will mean they get flooded with requests from other people who were "totes just testing," regardless of legitimacy, and that leads to a bunch of follow up posts (presumably here, since I don't think there's an official forum) about people already banned feeling more betrayed because it wasn't turned over. Unbanning at this stage is more trouble than it's worth.
---
If you are low level , then your perks just suck .
---
I used to suck at it but then I maximized my perk loadout and found which guns work best for me . Now I usually kill or 4 and make to top 10 almost always .
---
Also try to stay close to a team , because 4 are better than 1 almost always.
---
I'm level 140, and my stats are 285/310 Ballistic/Energy resist. Like I said, up until now I had a problem with Level 62 ghouls for other reasons but not to the extent where they start 2-shotting me. They usually took about 5-6 hits to kill me before now. And no, I'm not under any effects either
---
Im still enjoying it, but I got it on sale for $15. If you enjoy a great story, this isn't for you. If you enjoy exploring, collecting resources, and crafting, I would suggest it. Plus the user base is amazing and helpful
---
I played it a ton from never playing, and I feel like it's a little weirdly balanced.  Some times it feels fair, other times you just get killed before you can even react.  I think some of the perks are just too strong, and if you don't have them you're at a distinct disadvantage.    
---
It's so easy to instantly die and there's a very small reward for getting kills it only makes sense to just hide for as long as possible.
---
I’m not sure. They seem to hit hard but my average dr/Er is around 450+. If I throw on the bolstering it hits 700. They do still hurt some but a lot of the times it’s the rads that hurt most
---
Bethesda does list, but for some reason, they aren't talking.. and somewhere along the line there is a breakdown, but many inside the company are trying
---
In three days, this game will be one year old. Where were you in the ten months before the last two where Bethesda was also acting stupid?
---
That existed in Beta. Thought they fixed that.... oh yea... I forgot how patches work for Bethesda
---
nice , now the rest of the world
---
The oxygen was shut off shortly after you left so it's unlikely we're able to go back in ever again
---
Wait... I thought it was October... and we’re in November... I’m confused. What’s the anniversary date if it’s not October 23?
---
Considering it's Bethesda, people should really know better. Several hundred people since probably Morrowind have banned together at different intervals and released comprehensive bug fixes for every single SP BGS release. People did it for free and fun at every stage before, but somehow now they need another motive.
---
But if the vault door opens again wouldn't you get some O2 in the vault
---
What happened to the poll. Does anyone have a link to that? I never saw the results
---
color me curious
---
Does the weapon have 250DR?
---
...you told us a map maker would be banned and not receive responses from Bethesda and eventually would just quit altogether and remove his materials when you didn't even know who he was 9 hours ago? Somehow I doubt you called that.
---
Id say yes, if you can handle a live service game at its start.
---
My friend found a way to force the server to crash today so yea. It’s been VERY crash because the one person you don’t want to figure out how to figured out how to
---
It's an updated version. Also, this is a post that needs to be top of the subreddit imo
---
I got the 14,000 xp for the NW rewards this week without getting a single kill, so I definitely suck at playing the way it is intended. I just play it as an elaborate game of hide and seek. If you want to grind it AFK just get the aquaboy perk and sit in the middle of the toxic pond while you watch TV.
---
I get where you're coming from but this is hardly a threat. 
---
Let's say you get banned and then you post that video. It'd get taken down pretty quick by a mod, not because they're particularly attentive but someone will report it. I'd be surprised if the exploit makes it past 10 mins. 
---
Also, you do realise that this is a sub that'll blame you for letting people know of the crash exploit rather than blame Bethesda for allowing it to get this far, for not having stable servers and for not fixing it quickly enough. Have you seen some of the BS leaps in "logic" some of the posters have here?
---
BOS quests or scorchbeast queen
---
But at that same point I’d no longer have a game to play. So what would I care who blames me? I’m no longer able to access a game I paid $60 for after reporting an issue I never caused but found. But I don’t really see that being an issue. I’d just rather have a card in my back pocket in the worst case scenario to point to
---
You need circulation otherwise the deeper parts of the vault won't get fresh oxygen and CO2 won't be removed.
---
I can kill everything with switchblades. A level 80 Sheepsquatch takes about 20 seconds
---
Just 94, when it doesn’t crash
---
Sweet tried looking to no avail. Would appriacte that!
---
Level?
---
Travel to player vending machines at camps and also turn in legendarys for scrip to get legendarys from purveyor.
---
I call bullshit
---
Feel free to. That’s what comment sections are for
---
I mean the way it's going it's that or have the franchise be monetized into the ground if it hasn't already and not exist. I know me personally im not going to buy another Bethesda game unless it's genuinely amazing. Bethesda has ruined pretty much entire mountains of goodwill and now i think it's going to effect everything they do from now on. Not just fallout but also elder scrolls and starfield especially as that's their next game.
---
Game could be bugged, or they're wearing sentinel/cav armor. They could also be outside of the zone that counts as being inside the workshop area
---
+1
---
He's pretty funny and is from the land down under.
---
Yeah, let's! Get started on it and hit me up when its done.
---
Is he in the actual area?is it his workshop and Is there a power plant event near by
---
High luck helps with any chance based perks, someone running Bloodied wearing Sentinel unyielding with +1 Luck &amp; Serendipity...crazy...
---
Definitely inside the zone. Not sure what that armor does to be honest. It makes them impervious to any damage?
---
Ha!
---
You mean you actually can kill things In NW... I thought it was just jumping around a vault. I have killed rad scorpion in all the rounds I have played. I really wanted that costume but then calculated it would take me 20 hours of farming to get.... nope!
---
Uhhh i don't have 1st but I'm not dumb and i stash stuff i get from ppl
---
Sentinel armor gives you a 75% chance to take 15% less damage while standing still, cavalier is the same but with sprinting/moving(?) in general. If you're wearing a full set of either one, you're *almost* completely safe from taking damage. Bolstering armor adds damage resistance the lower your health, so add that onto either sentinel or cavalier and you're almost invincible. Either they were wearing one of those types of armor, or your game is bugged. What type of weapon were you using?
---
FO76 was a game created and run like a Vault Tech experiment. Prove me wrong.
---
I'd wait awhile before trying to sell any of those. They'll regain value the longer time goes on from that event!
---
pretty sure luck doesnt impact chance based perks
---
Ooh, this is a good question. I didn't think of this scenario!
---
Awesome! I’ll hold onto it then
---
Only the clean helmat was part of mischief night.  At least from what I got.  Was the suit a drop for that too and i just didnt get it?
---
Using a Bloodied LMG (that hits pretty hard) they were moving and not moving at times. He was up around 65% health or so.
---
His workshop - Hemlock holes so no event.
---
What level were they and which workshop was it?
---
and yes definitely within the area
---
Got it. You just want to ignore what Bethesda is doing to people of the community such as this content creator and just expect him to take it. "Better take that ban and continue to pay out money to continue supporting tools for a game you can't play!."
---
Honestly if you want to think he is the bad guy here as well, go ahead. Keep thinking it's just about 'outrage culture', but thinking both sides are in the wrong? How much benefit of the doubt are you able to give to Bethesda?
---
make a mule... most people do this. I managed to make a mule in one account. Just need to be in the same server. Back then survival mode server is the answer, now... you need  a friend online I think. I just put my items in secret place, re-login and grab it with the mule. Dunno whether this method is safe or not now, since last time I played this game is 3 months ago.  
---
And yes, my mule is like a wealthy noob with lotsa useless unique item for collection while my main only has 1 clothes on him... and a storage full of junks...
---
Another pay-"for-convenience" subscription.
---
You have to remember, it's not a fallout game mode. It's an attempt to get the battle royal genre people involved who were on the edge. I've personally been playing since FO1 and even FO3 and FO4 seem odd to me. So.... Take what we can get? Idk what to expect from 76 at this point. I'm taking anything they throw at me.
---
Was he moving or afk
---
What about white powder jumpsuit?
---
STOP. GIVING. MONEY. TO. THIS. COMPANY.
---
Oh nope I was wrong it is only the helmet so the suit is still worth something. Not sure what the price is but I saw it sell for 6k a few days on the trading sub.
---
Works with super duper, thinking isn't knowing.
---
Hemlock Holes - 46
---
i'v seen this with machinegun weapons.
---
reminded me of this :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nr2GeWiDrdY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nr2GeWiDrdY) 
---
part of what made me ask why Serendipity is so strong, it seems like it has no internal cooldown
---
Or, y'know, just don't have the high-capacity backpack on all the time
---
You could but where the hell am I gonna store those 38 nuclear keycards now?!
---
Yes this is a joke
---
Everyone's comments reminds me of when fallout 4 came out and you could mod anything to any weapon. Mix an match pieces of weapons to make ridiculous monstrosities.
---
What about the helmets, what do they go for?
---
Yeah either he was wearing OP armor or the game was bugged. No reason you shouldn't have been able to kill him. I've taken workshops while still in pacifist mode, and was still able to be killed if I was in the zone when someone came to contest my workshop, so you should have been able to kill him
---
I got my copy for free.
---
If I'd paid a cent, I'd be bloody furious. 
---
I enjoy the game, when it works properly but it has more bugs than a Timon and Pumba buffer.
---
Yeah it's a great perk, has saved my ass countless times, but I really think it pops up too often. At least give it some sort of cool down
---
Just nail them to your armor. Nuclear Keycards make good armor and that's a facf
---
Luck doesn't affect Super Duper. It's a flat chance.
---
500 caps now because of the influx into the market
---
Lol you the best
---
Ok cool.  Thanks!
---
support dumb companies, receive dumb results. hope y'all learn your lesson
---
Will you buy doom etheral ?
---
We live in a world where people buy the new iphone every year when they're never much different and you can literally buy multiple consoles or dozens of full priced games for the price of one i phone. This is tame compared to that.
---
They already have your money, they stop giving a shit at that point. Any more money they get from you is just bonus
---
 I’ve been bugged in a work shop before where I took no damage
---
Wish I could join you (PS4) and that more would post about “lucky” servers so the community could do some testing.  I certainly feel there’s something to it as I’ve experienced some good luck as you have before.
---
I'd say yes. I got a good 100+ hours out of it last year. Though definitely try to play with a friend or two.
---
I love morrowind. That is the game that made me fall in love with open world RPGs. I miss not having little arrows and markers telling me exactly where to go and who to talk to. Used to have to read/listen to directions, find terrain features and figure out clues. I wish they would remake Morrowind with modern graphics.
---
mainly because ps and xbox got a delay to make sure the patch is right so there is no absurd shenanigans like in pc.
---
In PC, you can get either constantly crash days or never even crash days due to this "lets put it on PC first to test it"
---
The plans are out there. I make them frequently to get some extra caps
---
The thing is this guy specifically is part of the reason a security flaw was fixed (because they found it). If he and many others didn't do this there'd still be a security flaw available for anyone to exploit. Bethesda literally needs these people to do their jobs or very bad things could happen
---
To the big, bulky, gas mask like helmet? Not the bug eyed version?
---
Yeah you can :)
---
I've always had issues with high level ghouls...specifically the charred versions. They hit like a truck, often infect me and give me tons of rads. And that's even wearing power armor. If I wasn't wearing power armor I'd be super dead. I'm level 121 btw.
---
You can't have instigating and vampire on the same weapon.
---
I mean, my statement clearly illustrates that I agree, but I guess I typed it with too many words. Yes, they need people like him. No, they don't realize that. Caring at this point is not going to lead to them overturning the ban.
---
The plans are out there but only on PC.
---
Nobody on Xbox/PS4 has them and anyone who says they do is a liar.
---
I mean... This game was a rushed product and made by a NEW TEAM that really didn't have the knowledge to truly run and work this system. In all honesty, the buggyness is probably because due to their lack of knowledge and Zenimax rushing everything to completion because this game will not survive in the long run, so it's better to milk the money first and foremost...  
---
However, since I do know that F76 is mostly done by the new Austin Team... I'm not too worried about Starfield and TES6, as we aren't too certain how deep Zenimax's greed has actually gotten into the Maryland Team. All we know about is the Creation Club, which isn't that bad and is tolerable. (I may have gotten some stuff of of it personally).
---
You have zero clue where they put the scrap.  Stop whining, go play rust
---
I still can't believe they're refusing to give him a refund, especially after they only just got taken to court for not giving people refunds for 76.
---
Do they want to get sued? Because not offering a refund of fallout first for being faulty is 100% illegal
---
You can have as many as you want with the exception of herbivore and carnivore. That hasn’t to be either or.
---
That's basically how it was in Fallen Earth and it's an amazing idea. I really hope for this as well.
---
That's what they got banned for using
---
Hahaha, trueeee!
---
Let’s compare Fallout 76 with a game like Star Wars: The Old Republic.
---
***
---
FO76:
---
* Current price—$25 on Amazon
---
* Main Story Length—About 20-25 hours.
---
* Story Quality—Poor. No NPCs really hurts it.
---
* Playability—Very buggy. Can be described as boring and grindy. Missions are mostly lame (only stand out one being the one where you defend the BoS base with the missile turret from a scorchbeast. Enemies are bulletsponges. Survival element is tedious.
---
* Ways to earn premium currency—In-game challenges and real money.
---
* Monetization—Previously only cosmetic, now adding P2W elements.
---
SWTOR:
---
* Current Price—Free
---
* Main Story Length—25-35sh hours for each class story. There are 8 classes.
---
* Story Quality—Surprisingly good. There are branching pathways for each story. There’s fully voiced everything, cutscenes, companions, etc. Dialogue can be surprisingly funny or impactful at times.
---
* Playability—Decent. Enemies are no more bulletspongy than other MMOs. Most of the missions aren’t very interesting, mechanics-wise.
---
* Ways to earn premium currency—Achievements, setting up a security key (basically 2-factor ID), and real money.
---
* Monetization—Cosmetic and convenience. 
---
Not really the same style of game but my point still stands. Hell, there’s no reason that FO76 should be *worse* than SWTOR, it should be the opposite.
---
your stance it's emotional and biased. Dollar wins everytime- good luck convincing Bethesda to change their way off doing business based on good will and giving up all the cash they make. Let us pay for the content. you got your money's worth if you played the game for 1k hours. if not- it's not for you. people who have spent more than that in game and still are signed up are paying. So your point is pointless. if part of a group decides to invest in a product the group that doesn't want to and thinks it is unfair doesn't have to use the product. They can gripe but it's a lost cause.
---
With the way they handled the Halloween content, we'll be lucky if Thanksgiving content has dropped the day after Thanksgiving.
---
It’s because you basically already live in a wasteland full of things that want to kill you, the deliverypeople need hazard pay and it comes out of your pockets,
---
/s
---
Cool story bro.
---
Which honestly is a very legitimate reason to not play anymore imo because if it wasn't for him and others there'd still be that security flaw out there.
---
Is there no way for a large bunch of you in the US to just get together and physically go up to their offices and demand an explanation? This has legit been the worst launch and subsequent handling ever. I know that gets said a lot about games, but whether you speak of No Man's Sky or Battlefield V from recent past, both those have headed in better directions after launch. Even RDR2 is getting fixes that a lot of users seem happy with. Maybe anthem was as bad as Fo76, doesn't matter. This is bad. They need to be held accountable and their chosen digital methods are serving as nothing but a curtain for them to hide behind.
---
I know your pain. It seems certain weapons get 95% and miss multiple times compared to other weapons. Exiting Vats fixes it usually.
---
If 60 bucks is enough to hold your memory of something for a year then I feel sorry for your life. Except this is just you beating a dead horse anyways.
---
I didn't buy FO76 because of precisely this.    
---
I have been subbed here hoping to see a reason to buy the game eventually, but the more time that pass, the happier I am to have saved my money.
---
They sometimes spawn under the ground at Thunder Mnt. PP.
---
Lol "now" they're acting stupid.
---
I was responding to the effect of having the door open without a vent system operational.
---
Or maybe how PA gives you a few minutes underwater without drowning
---
LOL
---
Same issue with the wood mask
---
You can have up to 18 of the 19 mutations available in the game. You have to choose between Carnivore or Herbivore. For reasons
---
Hi. Me and the wife have been playing on and off since release.  
---
We have a kiddo, and so we haven't been following closely as to any developments--but, as far as we can tell, the only thing that's changed is how they tryin' to flex the cash shop.  
---
That's not to say there haven't been changes. I'm sure there have been. Just, uh... nothing of consequence, at least from our perspective.  
---
We still find it fun. But we also recognize we're in the minority here. And we also believe the game is more-or-less still in some kind of weird development phase, despite being released, and aren't sure if it will ever be "feature complete," for lack of a better expression.
---
Insert heart emoji here
---
Seriously. Unless your taking workshops, its voluntary. And I'm easily provoked so I get it. But fuck them, they ain't getting my pencils lol. Although it sucks since workshops are the only way for them to force pvp on someone and ppl need those for goods
---
Why are you on this sub? You don’t even play the game? Do you generally just try to ruin other people’s fun or?
---
If you're still playing this 'game' you are part of the problem.
---
At least you can scum save in Xcom
---
I agree but if no ones online friend wise then you run the risk of not joining the same server off someone else In the lobby you dumped gear. Fallout really needs a destiny storage system that carries over since we are stuck with specific builds. I have good crap for rifles stuck on my melee build and they're too good to risk potentially losing with a random rejoin. Bethesda, move yo ass and fix this
---
Buh bye
---
Some jackwagons were selling them for 10k caps this evening on Xbox
---
Scrapbox on the Atom Store is still pay2win. 100% against that as much as I am putting it behind the Fallout 1st pay wall.
---
I don't play the game but I still pop in here every now and then to see what shit storm Bethesda is trying to stomp out at the time. It's fairly entertaining tbh.
---
5% is 1 in 20. It's not that unrealistic to get 2 or 3 misses in a row. Quite unlikely, sure but very possible.
---
It’s alright though because he gets his information from trusted Youtubers that definitely don’t just create unnecessary and overdramatic drama for views.
---
Relog and they spawn correctly
---
Yeah well maybe be less of a ass. It’s pretty pathetic you come here to shit on people playing a game you don’t even play. Do you really have nothing else going on In life to the point this is how you entertain yourself?
---
That would mean adding content, thus no
---
No one here cares about Bootleg Borderlands
---
We’ll see... or we won’t because this is a troll post.
---
I would love nothing more than to watch Bethesda go bankrupt after this shitstain behavior they’ve had ever since FO76 came out.
---
That was one of like 2 comments I've made on this sub so I'm definitely not here to "shit on people". Does reading 2 or 3 posts on a sub every month or so really mean I have nothing going on in my life?
---
Sure thing, I'm a big fan of fallout shelter and like what they did there so I was pretty hopeful with 76. I wish they released fallout shelter 2 in N.America but they decided to just release it in China. 76 to me is sad because although I think it can be fun, you have to have so many things to just enjoy it. A fast comp or console, really fast internet, a lot of patience, and a lot of time. I was hoping they'd have an offline version of 76 that doesn't take itself so serious and isn't constantly poked by Bethesdas hands. I was hoping when they released thing like BR it would just be a fallout 76 themed f2p thing that just builds interest and good will, but instead it was advantageous to be an accomplished player, or be a hacker and all the rewards goes to the online only account . I was hoping the private servers would be  self hostable and free to have your own world that had nothing to do with connecting to the main games, so you could mod and not wreck the game for others, they did not do that.  Yes I agree with you, what happened stated by OP to this glitch hunter, exploit detective work to give Beth some free fixes is tragic (I do bug fixes for a lot of games myself so I appreciate what is transpiring) it should take a notch from their cane of respect. Some strange choices by the publisher and by Zeni on this one. Not listening to players, banning community members trying to help and just making decisions up each new controversy, it's like they want 76 to suck for people.  If they asked me I'd have sold more in silly skins for the BR last year upon release then they made selling anything in the atomshop.  Who doesn't want to be a super mutant or robot in a f2p BR of Fallout? No one :p. 
---
There is nothing wrong with doing some quality assurance for games when you are handing in results and not acquiring wealth or advantages for exploits. In a game like kingdomofloathing.com the dev Jick rewards bug finders and honestly I have never seen Beth reward or indicate anything from bug finders other then " We have a place you can submit to and we may fix it"  I know they never fixed any of the bugs I've submitted so w/e...z
---
I’m not going to go through your posting history. You subscribe to a sub to a game you don’t even play to tell people the game sucks or the company who makes it sucks.
---
That’s enough for me. I personally would find better things to do myself.
---
Since no one seems to believe me I’ll give them one month. Tomorrow I will record a video of the issue and the cause. If it’s fixed, I will release the video, if it’s not, I release the video. If they can’t fix a severe game breaking issue in one month then it deserves some spotlight. Does that seem like a fair move forward without allowing trolls access by just blurting it out to the public?
---
It's a cool idea, there are some amazing builders out there. Budget is a huge hindrance (a necessary evil) and limits the creativity of the community.
---
I'm not actually subscribed and I've never come on here and said the game sucks. Again, I haven't played it so I have no right to say it sucks. I was a huge fan of Bethesda and seeing the way they've treated this game and their own fanbase was extremely disappointing. I'd really appreciate if you would stop making assumptions about my behavior.
---
I don’t think the problem lies with the great people that dream up the fantastic world we enjoy and the coders that make it happen, so Wastelanders isn’t really part of the equation for me.  The argument about the game’s artistic merit is separate.
---
The lions share of the community’s problem seems to be from the corporate aspects of the game. The atom shop and customer service are consistently failing to meet the expectations of the consumer.  Scratch that....  The atom shop is likely performing ok.  I think pricing is on the high end of industry standards, and sometimes the bugs are annoying but do tend to get fixed with the nearest patch. Based on camps I visit, product is being sold and it’s very popular.  
---
Bethesda’s customer service seems to consistently disappoint.  Customer service tends to be the Achilles heel of any large company, but it seems like this is brand new territory for BGS.  In some ways I suppose it is. I’m not sure if they’ve ever created a game in which asset exploitation is so prevalent or damaging.  In a single player game, cheat codes and mods don’t hurt the experience of other players. 
---
The franchise has never had to worry about these issues. Because some players are willing to aggressively exploit, it seems that Bethesda’s policing has taken a “shoot now ask questions later” approach.  It’s unfortunate, but not without precedent.  
---
I just hope innocence can be found for a player with aberrant but benign gaming activity, especially when that player is focusing their considerable efforts towards bettering the community.
---
Only way this game could really see any good at this point is when the servers shut down and force solo play, so people can come in and try and come together to make a more cohesive fallout game.
---
I loved the guns, the map, all the new Enemies. The workshop locations. I loved a LOT of it. But i cannot wait for the day they kill support so people can fuck around and fix it all.
---
The wasteland trapper mask from the atom store does as well I believe
---
Voted
---
Change shadow distance to low and set the grass distance slider all the way to the left.
---
I run a 1080ti at 1440p and changing those two settings gave a huge boost in performance around the Whitesprings area.
---
I’ll try it but it’s only when a camp exists around the Whitesprings. The bigger the camp the worse it is. One usually drops to about 45 frames, two to 30, and those three knocked me into the 10s
---
Yep
---
I see, and it is another one that doesn't mention it in the tooltip? I do not own it so I cannot tell, but from reading other threads they mention no specific description.
---
Just hide and seek. I smash it on double exp weekends to get the high level rewards
---
Becoming? It's been like that a while I'm sorry people getting burned like this but everybody should have stopped paying for this clusterfuck a long time ago. Hard to have sympathy for people who are still financing this bloodsucking corporation
---
This games blows amazing that anyone is still playing it
---
I would really appreciate if you stop coming here to this sub of a game you don’t even play to toss shade. It’s pathetic and annoying.
---
Surgical masks works as well. May favorite since you can still wear helmets and eye wear
---
I got mine doing those softie BoS quests. Long live the Enclave!
---
Sup Juicebox
---
Sounds like a good way to get arrested for trespassing.
---
Innovsurvivalist if looking for guides
---
There's other maps out there.
---
Once again, I don't come here to toss shade. I come here to watch a little drama unfold every now and again. The first comment I made to you was to maybe help you understand where the OP was coming from, even if they were being a bit of a douche about it.
---
I'm sure I read somewhere that the normal bandannas have the "Gas Mask Effect," but without the -2 Perception.
---
Haven't bothered to confirm it though.
---
I watched a few fellow youtubers before I got into making content myself. Majority of the few I had watched now only chime in when there is a big huff about one thing or the other. The smaller youtubers I would watch moved on and started to put out a much more negative vibe towards this game, so I moved on from them as well.
---
I got a lot of camp inspiration from Skooled Zone, loved his fo4 stuff, but he kinda dropped the 76 stuff and quit it, so I haven't checked in since that. Jug taught me a lot of camp stuff and norepawns as well. CaptainBeardy has some interesting builds.
---
I pop in on Innovsurvivalist every few weeks depending on my mood, dip into MizTracys vids from time to time, and GamerMOMover50 as well, depending on the subject. I think they are more of the positive vibe but I haven't watched them all on the regular.
---
Widgeon TV hits a certain cinematic vibe that I enjoy.
---
I like to check out Rifle Gaming and CaptainNoob if they put out something that sparks my interest.
---
Also, guilty pleasure, I love Kevduit. I know he's not always positive in the 76 content he puts out, but I admire and love his editing and he has a voice that I enjoy. 
---
Unpopular reddit opinion maybe, but I'll catch Juicehead every now and then if he's reporting on something I'd like to hear about. Bormally I steer clear of any videos or Youtubers that are reporting in what's going on surrounding the game. On YouTube, normally fo76 news is laced with a lot of negative commentary or disappointment and I find it often a grab at views.
---
It's really hard to find people reporting on the game and the tone of the video being hopeful, positive or even objective. I'd really enjoy watching that, but it'd get disliked into obscurity pretty quickly with how toxic the general view of FO76 can be. Shame really.
---
Anyways..  just my opinion. I'm interested into checking out some of the other youtubers in the comments!
---
So, there's like what, 2 options huh?
---
In in the pipboy it says its protects and I see no negative effects to perception on my status.
---
Pretty much business as usual
---
They're pretty much only sold by the Brotherhood bot in Watoga, Raider Bot at Pleasant Valley and Graham.  So nobody will really have an extra laying about to give or sell cheap. Just pony up the 8000+ caps (based on perks/grape mentats).  Selling needed ammo types (5.56, .45, Fusion/Plasma Cores, Shotgun Shells, Plasma Cartridges) are an easy way to make caps.
---
Armored raider skull helmet also has no downside. Furthermore, I've noticed it won't unequip glasses
---
Provenance Equity owns 25 percent of Zenimax. In 2015 they tried to find a buyer for the share they have. No one wanted it. Bethesdas prior revenue stream is not appealing to investors. They want continual income as opposed to spikes when games release. Since 2015 Bethesda has been shifting to accommodate this. Fallout Shelter, Blades, Paid mods, 76, all games that generate income after the launch date. You should fully expect both Starfield and TES 6 to have MTX, be it cosmetics, mods, or something else. Todd and his group likely have no say in this. These choices are being made by old fucks on a board somewhere, and they could give less then a shit if the game is good, as long as it makes money. Considering the data leaks we have seen on 76 for 1st sales it seems all indications are that it will. I would be very, very worried about the future of Betheda games.
---
Bethesda what the hell guys? Make this right you donks
---
Nah, some days you just have to answer 200 times to the same question. Cut and Paste answers aren't bad or wrong. If you want to work as effectively as possible, you need those. I've worked in community/ customer service, it's not easy. The hardest days were when the company fucked up real bad and you get the cut and paste answers directly from the exec office with a big warning sign not to deviate in any way from it or to give any more details.
---
Nice try Todd
---
Do i have to worry about it getting killed?
---
I don't think anybody likes anything they're not good at
---
Dang... new to the mode, and I was clearly undervaluing PA and Hazmat suits.  Had no idea they protected you from the storm that much.
---
Currently playing, great game so far!!!
---
Op doesn’t even play the game either. Two peas in the same douche bag pod I guess.
---
All problems this game has aside, if you like fallout style openworld games this game is worth 20 bucks quite quite easily.
---
I stopped reading at a player who doesnt play. Seriously why right this book?
---
Those perks are a waste of cards my guy.  I have 1 str, no weight perks, have had that build from the start.  You don't need to pick up everything you see, there are only a few things you need a constant supply of everything else you should just ignore unless you are going to sell it right away or there's something specific you need to make.
---
If you like Fallout and open world - it’s a good buy.
---
The game is not as “buggy” as it’s described in some posts on this forum.  Also, you will start noticing the bugs after you have a few hundred hours in the game and by then you already got value for your money.
---
Everyone has high hopes for the Wastekanders DLC that’s promised in 2020.
---
After almost 1000 hours in-game, FO76 is still my “go-to” game.  The open world is beautiful- haven’t found another open world game with so many possibilities.
---
because no time soon is anything going to change regarding first and the atomic shop. And for those who still enjoy the game, we want to give our ideas to make some kind of difference. And i dont care about credit since seeing it in game would be enough for me
---
Could be people that accidentally bought an extra before the (known) tag was introduced.  All known references I checked online show it as only from those three vendors.  It could possibly be a super rare drop from some events, but I have no idea which events in the regions could have it then.
---
Probably as easy as weird science where you just write your dreams on a piece of paper, and... like hook it up to the computer, hit run and bam.  Magic.  :P
---
I agree. It would need a HUD notification when the event is triggered, however.  They got it 80% right by adding it to a notified rotation of events, and now it just needs the same treatment as other end game events. Participation and success certainly improved with the new system.
---
If they also added a minute or two to the time available to fill the hoppers, the event would be markedly improved.  If that’s off the table, giving a top tier deathclaw about 25% more DR would help a lot. It’s really frustrating to see a glowing deathclaw get merked by a stingwing with superpowered poison damage.
---
Learned this the hard way.  Good bye BE Gatling gun.
---
It did for a while then got boring
---
I wouldn't hold your breath on it. Bethesda is saving a substantial amount of money just giving you a private game and calling is a "server".
---
Oh yes you lived in the same town and went to the same school yet ONLY met each other on the game a year ago. Yes must've always known each other hey!
---
Living in the same town and going to the same school doesn't mean fucking shit if you guys never even knew each other during those times. So shut the fuck up with that bullshit.
---
1 year. 1 fucking year and you're getting ready to marry. Lmfao. Why rush it? Why rush getting married when you retarded lovebirds can wait a few years and actually get to know each other properly instead of wasting a bunch of money on getting married when it'll most likely end up in a divorce which hey more money and other shit wasted!
---
Delusional fuckheads.
---
Someone got your info and used your account for duping/ getting illegal items. This haplens all the time on people with weak passwords. Make em long, have caps and special characters. Easy peasy security.
---
When Rick Sanchez tells you something is so, you quiet down and accept that it's so.
---
General bug fixes, Cryptid quest line + events + sheepsquatch enemy, tadpole quests with a backpack, nukashine quest with brewing, legendary vendor, camp vending machines, stash and camp budget increases, survival servers added, survival servers removed, private servers, new dungeons, high level vault raids, 3 seasonal events, nuclear winter, I feel like I'm forgetting some stuff but I can't remember.
---
Do you have calibrated shocks?
---
This was the reply I was looking for as I was also curious with OP. Thank you for your detail!
---
Don't think I'd even consider elder scrolls or fallout anymore unless they follow through with their initial sales pitch of 'private servers with mods'.   
---
If this game is indicative of but a fraction of what they are going to bring to the future, I don't see many people flocking to worship their releases at all.   
---
I think I'm more excited for 2077 than any of Bethesda's games to date.
---
What’s this in regards to? I also stopped playing like OP. Genuinely curious.
---
Hackers
---
Maybe now people will see that services like fallout first do actually ruin our hobby...
---
I went ahead and dug up the price of it, it was a long time ago, you probably just misremembered
---
https://imgur.com/a/iTMm8Wy
---
actually no, it's because the division leads like spencer so much that they canned don mattrick, who was trying to put the xbox brand in to the ground, and replaced him with spencer, who has turned everything around wonderfully.
---
mattrick, incidentally, went on to become the ceo of zynga, the facebook games people. he then ran them into the ground as well, so much so that the person he replaced, the founder of the company, came back and kicked him out.
---
Most of the weapons in the game are because dupers made a bunch. The economy in 76 would hardly exist without dupers keeping stuff coming into the market. Half the weapons you have bought from someone’s vendor are *probably* duped, there’s no real way to track it but I’m damn sure you’d be pretty upset if half your weapons disappeared because Bethesda wipes them all out.
---
Whats the diference
---
you should take a look at the bethesda board of directors some time.
---
there's such people as: donald trumps brother, and random baseball player. basically, everyone on the board is not someone you'd ever think to be associated with a video game company.
---
Dupers make a game of fucking up the game, Scammers trick people
---
They did it back in February and no one freaked out too bad
---
Gonna give you a list of things you missed. This is a copy paste message and may not be applicable to the questions asked. Reply and I'll go into detail on things if you want
---
March is when they actually started improving the game, from Nov-Feb it was only bug fixes and a boring world. Not listing things in any order, you missed:
---
three weeklong holiday events with camp and cosmetic rewards (minor addition)
---
alcohol crafting with daily quests (minor addition) 
---
a camera for taking quicker pictures (minor addition)
---
New faction and questline with backpack reward (large addition)
---
Sheepsquatch questline with unique weapon reward and side quests, two repeatable events (major addition)
---
Small dungeon with quest (small addition)
---
Large dungeon with repeatable event (large addition)
---
Player Vending Machines (small addition)
---
Nuclear Winter game mode with 51 other players in a battle Royale scenario with special cosmetic rewards (major addition)
---
Special vendor that gives random Legendaries in exchange for other Legendaries (small addition)
---
Vault Raid which gives guaranteed armor rewards with unique set bonuses (major addition)
---
Display cases for your camp which allows you to place items so visitors can view them (minor addition)
---
Basically I put either small, large, or major for what these updates added to the game. However, that's only in terms of content. For example I would say player vending and the legendary vendor were bigger adds than say vault raids or the Arktos Pharma dungeon. Still a buggy game though, but that's what Bethesda is. Wastelanders will be like a chapter 2 with a supposedly different feel but it's coming out early next year
---
No I definitely only had 500 atoms. I had the Amazon special which gave you 500 atoms when you bought the game and I spent all of those on the Power Armour on the last day before it was removed from sale.
---
Yea I’m using mostly 2 star unyielding, dream set would be a full unyielding food drink and chem weight reduction +str set.
---
Dupers are worse. Makes farming which is a really big part of the game useless. Then again, we got hackers that do 200k damage per shot and that makes the whole game meaningless.
---
Still it did not affect the everyday users. The folks it caught KNEW they had dupes. Not just some random. Thats why there wasnt a huge outcry. If they deleted all the dupes in the game....folks would be crying and we would be hearing it. 😂😂
---
I would say 1* around 1000 caps, 2* with a good second effect 2000-2500 caps, 3* depending effects 5000 up to 20000. Chest can be very expensive.
---
The worst is the 95% miss with a melee weapon and standing right next to the enemy. 🤷‍♀️
---
The burrows was a dungeon added to the game that was kinda over hyped before it's release and people were overwhelmed when it dropped. It's still a wonderfully designed area and people farm there fairly often.
---
Thank you very much
---
Congratulations, Overseer!
---
Got a bad feeling 2077's gonna flop. Looks and plays like Watchdogs, a game people didn't like so much
---
You are a hero ! I totally agree with you
---
Sure but it gets colder the higher up you go the wings shouldn't melt.
---
It was actually kinda funny, every time ol' Wooly stomped or shot quills, the dinner triangle would ring like Armageddon was comin' all over again.
---
I mean, I still killed the damn thing, of course. But the triangle was funny.
---
Private servers are already in the game and they said modding is coming at a later point. Possibly around wastelanders.
---
I'm put off from suggesting ideas now in case they just use it for fallout first only.
---
403 upvotes (so far) says differently
---
I agree
---
I have all 19
---
I suggest being Bloodied, as it pairs really well with sneak. Get a BE Lever with Dem Exp, and if you don't want to spend points on that perk for whatever reason, go BFFR. If you're not bloodied, then go for the same but JE/JFFR instead. There's really no reason to use anything else except maybe VE/VFFR if you prioritize regen over damage for whatever reason.
---
Good read lol
---
Play stupid game, win stupid prize.
---
So you're trying to start the class war as a Fallout firster.  
---
Dude, why even start some class war, geez.
---
Sorry you feel that way. Nothing is truly free anyways.
---
That is neat, they must have changed them sometime, bot helmets didn't protect me a long while ago when I played.
---
Not to mention, all 76 servers are on AWS, not some open server stuff like minecraft.  
---
So unless you're in good with Bezos, you're not gonna get a server for this game outside of buying Fallout First.
---
Slots for 8 people? No no no, this is only 'instanced' servers by the looks of it. Perhaps I am wrong though. This sounds like they are trying to skirt around the idea of real private servers?   
---
Yeah they are instanced 'Private Worlds'. The host of the server is still on Bethesda's end if I'm not mistaken. When you can determine who hosts the server and when there isn't a monthly fee tied to your game account, that is actual private servers. Do you have access to console commands in your instanced world?  
---
The idea is to get the game away from them.
---
PTS soon my guy, be patient.
---
Can confirm these two settings, however on a 1080ti I will still get around only 50FPS on the WS golf course.
---
Atom shop sales and maybe that leaked free week of 1st.  
---
Fallout 4 and Skyrim got creation club sales for their birthdays.
---
Well, you DO still have the mothman tag...
---
;)
---
RIP when Nuclear Material got nerfed into Uraniam Ore. That was like a 3x nerf
---
Sounds like the melee equivalent of ranged weapon VATS issue.  You have 98% hit change and every shot is a complete miss by a mile.  You have to exit VATS and re-enter then it's working as planned.  Between the empty weapon on fast travel and the VATS bug, it makes the game tedious.
---
This is the more sane position to take.  
---
I know it seems like bethesda is trying to take money from the capital G Gamers but I'm sure they are trying, they have a lot to do. Winter event was mentioned, Wastelanders, bug fixes, Fallout first can't sustain as what it is just now, trust me, there's also the 1 year anniversary, and then the next vault raid if that ever comes to reality, and then they have to figure out what 3 things they'll release next after wastelanders.
---
Bought it; was spending money on Atoms anyway. Scrapbox is nice but just saves some time bulking and selling or just dropping excess junk. Cosmetics are ok. Emotes are ok. Survival Tent is ok. I just leave it down by the SBQ though; rarely actually use it. Best use was freeing up room for a couple 5 more guns in my vendors.
---
This reminds me of before the Sheepsquatch was released in was "Defeat the Sheepsquatch (Wave 1/4)" and everyone was freaking out. Turns out they just get the label wrong...
---
YES.  I have several excellent mutant's weapons but don't use them because 10% is garbage.  Should minimally be 30% like the other specialized legendary damage increases for specific creatures.
---
You do know that not buying the product doesn't work no more. There will always be people who want to support the game's future, and they'll do that when they are provided an outlet to do so.
---
I managed to win a few last night, best streak being 3 1st places back to back.  I used to just hide and now I'm kinda branching out to killing when I have good weapons to do so(Handmade is so good for this, you rarely need a full clip to down someone)
---
Well Bethesda certainly isn’t doing anything about their bugs
---
Nope, Todd himself said that NPCs originally were never planned additions until feedback poured in and in janurary 2019 they started working on them.
---
I'm going to comment a ping at one of the CMs for a experiment...  
---
u/valseek
---
Does the two shot use more ammo on a weapon with no mag?
---
I think the server doesnt have to track up to 23 other players and spawn enemies for them, so that leave that leaves room for what \*should\* be spawning when you arrive at a given location. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That and youre alone so of course it will feel like more. Theres no one else killing them before you ever spot them.
---
You'll get mad soon with all that reloading aftery every shot. If you can get hands on any Quad one, that's the way to go.
---
It's an alright weapon, the faster fire rate dose nothing however since its a single shot weapon. But the reload is nice, and the increased damage is nice as well
---
Good thought there, thanks! I personally absolutely LOVE The Dragon for the ginormous report it makes, but it does take forever to reload, and I'm not sure I really want more than one stupid slow gun just for flavor lol.
---
It might be an advantage for a previously hoarding pve player, who wants to try some real action now. Doesn't make a difference for a regular pvper - those run min-maxed without junk anyway.
---
Doesn't answer anything my guy. It just sounds like you want a class war so YTers haved stuff to make videos on to me.
---
Why would you say that?
---
Ah yeah exactly. Perhaps this is only a phase for them? Surely they are just trying to milk money out of everyone for as long as they can until they allow real private servers to be release.  
---
The moment we get to choose who is hosting our servers and the moment we don't have to affiliate ourselves with Bethesda the better! But they know that this what we want and they are doing everything they can to try to get money before it happens.  
---
It has become evident that they can not be trusted to provide us with what we want. As such, we need to take this game away from them as quickly as possible. The longer this game remains as a paid service the worst it will get.   
---
The question is, did Todd knowing lie? Or was he just misguided as to what was going to happen.  
---
And it really is astounding how people can really defend this game in the face of such overwhelming greed. Every step they have taken has been a step in the wrong direction.
---
They spend a ton of money on market research. They know that people will buy their shit despite them acting this way.
---
So is it literally twice the damage per shot, or is the 'second round' less damaging? If you're aware?
---
Nah, heavies are great in pvp, you just need a tight corresponding build with it.
---
The damage number show is the damage it dose if both shots land, then second shot only dose 20% of the damage
---
I didn't really like FO4 and it's gameplay so I don't think I'm going to touch FO76
---
That's what the Outerworlds sub is saying, that it's only good if it's on sale and not worth $60 since it's not a triple AAA game
---
What is that supposed to mean?
---
Keep the BE for endgame pve and look out for JE/25 for pvp. Also despite what people tell you, explosive prefix is still very good in those fights, as it doesn't suffer dmg falloff and many of those engagements are from quite afar - and believe me, you are not gonna hit that much with regular 50 cal from 150 m away.
---
How did I do anything to ruin your fun?
---
You people are acting pissy.
---
Active Fallout 1st Member.  
---
(And I only paid £25 for FO76)  
---
I didn't have to join, but I did, I care not if doing so offends, my money my choice.  
---
Yes Fallout 76 has issues, but the only one that concerns me is the disconnects, even in my Private World, oh well, chin up and carry on playing.
---
I stopped playing once Apex Legends released. It just seems FO76 isnt really improving like we all had hoped
---
It's not tho.
---
Yeah, regular harpoon is a novelty; quad (and especially QE) are one of the best weapons in game.
---
Okay, cool, thanks for the info! I've never really played around with the different legendary effects beyond the VE double barrel I picked up many levels ago and have used ever since.
---
Unlimited storage is something that should have been in the game from day 0.  They originally told us that it was limited so they could get a better feel for how much server power they needed.  Fair argument, so we waited.  Then they told us "We're gonna double the capacity and see how sustainable that is."  So we took the 800 and it was nice but we quickly ran into the same problem again.I can understand limiting the storage of any item that has a condition gauge of variable modifiers like equipment and food, but scrap SHOULD be unlimited.  Not to mention the whole thing about them telling us that only cosmetic items would cost us more money.  
---
If people want to pay for a private world, I'm actually fine with that, but I would still like to see the ability to have 3rd party private servers.
---
I got it close to launch for 50 bucks, how is the AAA label of significance?
---
Nice, so a really sharp slope then lol
---
Armour being a bloodied I need all the armor I can get
---
Don't waste your time with a non explosive one the damage isn't anywhere near as high. I'm pretty much a harpoon gun build at this point. I've got a QE and BE which do 1800 damage and 3500 damage but I very rarely need the BE cause of the rapid shots with the QE. Harpoons are crazy strong
---
I've noticed this too there seems to multiple factors regarding legendary drops.
---
If you've just started playing after about 8 - 12 hours, West Tek is a gold mine the first round on a decent server.  I always seem to at least 2 \*\*\* at West Tek, 90% change of a legendary at the Radio Observatory, and a couple of \*\*/\*\*\* legendaries at Harpers.  Whitesprings will most likely deliver at least 1 \*\*\* weapon which to me always seems to be a decent rng.  There are times I'm amazed at what drops there.  After that I just jump to the other mode server and repeat (if farming legendaries).  
---
There is no doubt that legendaries seem to have a set number or  set number for a certain timeframe on a server before the rng for legendaries = 0.
---
So far this has worked pretty well, but there are times I've jumped multiple servers and received zippo or  a couple of \* legendaries and figure BGS blacklisted the character for the evening.  The next day everything is back to normal.
---
Yeah this guy has no idea what he is talking about, you are right.  
---
As soon as he started talking about 'balance' for a game that would have private servers that pretty much kind of threw out everything else he had to say.  
---
There are some people I suppose who want a very controlled and confined experience. And then there are those who want to choose exactly what experience they want with their friends/clan/guild/unit.  
---
I for one would love to recreate DayZ in this game on a private server. Please tell me how this is possible with 'private worlds'. Tell me how to choose which buildings I want, which mobs I want to spawn and how pvp works in the world.
---
Bethesda is good at making game worlds. They are not good at making games. Leave that to the players who can mod and adjust for their failures and short comings.   
---
And for that guy, sure keep playing the game as a service. Other people getting private servers will not harm your delicate ecosystem of oh so perfectly balanced and crafted game design by the bethesda. Does it hurt you that people don't want to be in your little shallow sandbox? It must be painful to see the wonderful things and the joy of being freed from bethesda will bring countless others.
---
If it Marine or Scout, has 3 stars and a weight reduction then it can be 10-15k for each arm or leg and 20-30k for a chest piece
---
Having started my Shotgunner build around level ten, and finally getting an explosive shotgun around level fifty, I take youe point very seriously, thanks!
---
That's not bad at all thank you for the information
---
&gt; holding out for wastelanders
---
“Bethesda, you’ve mocked and tricked me 27 times, just another 9 or 10 tomes, and I’ll consider starting to become less excited about you!”
---
Comment 660. Need six more
---
No not exactly what you lost but just giving you some random scrap.
---
It's weird, twice today I was just walking through Whitesprings when I got swarmed by what must have been every ghoul in the place. I don't know if they changed something, but I've never been surrounded by that many ghouls before.
---
You do know that indie producers make better games for 1/10th the price right?
---
It's not 1995. You aren't limited to big studio or nothing games.
---
It's not like Fallout76 is a novel or even interesting game. There are literally hundreds of free to play MMORPGs that do what it does, except better.
---
Every serious gamer I know abandoned it shortly after release. The only people left who play it, or on this sub, are chunks who got suckered by the husk of a once great developer slapping the Fallout label on a steaming turd - then wasting their free time by loving in denial about it.
---
DW guys, I'm sure the company will do a 180 and fix their wretched abortion of a game. Just wait for the next patch. Buy the next DLC. 😂
---
Add the flechettes mod, found at Watoga shopping plaza or pleasant valley ski resport. It will fire 8 projectiles from one harpoon and when you search what you've killed you'll find harpoons on them giving you infinite ammo.
---
My fun is fine. I just find it odd you sub on a game subreddit you don’t even play to shit on people. Like what kind of loser has nothing better to do in life?
---
Compared to auto rifles they are out classed since they don't have to use power armor and have better sights and scopes for range. Only heavy guns with strangler is good even then you have to use stealth boy or stealth boy mod so u dont get sniped or vats
---
So like a better take on what the crossbow does, nice. I'm down with at least playing with that as a toy.
---
I just wear a bandana...
---
except blizzard games actually work
---
Take hacking, rifle, explosives. Start with your group at a place with computers to hack. Get a tesla: win. Get a missile launcher: win a few fights. Get an auto grenade launcher: win. Get a minigun: give to that guy asking for a 50cal. Get a powerfist, auto laser, laser sniper: curse. If you can't get any good weapons, hope to find a noob tube in the yellow box and some extra 40mm grenades. Game has options for us with bad aim.
---
?
---
Seems not. Reported a guy two months ago and he still plays
---
I'm not shitting on anyone though if anyone is shitting on anyone it's you shitting on me for sharing my experience / opinion on the game.
---
Well, it's a shotgun, it's a sniper, it generates its own ammo and kills most folks in pvp in 1-2 shots. Doesn't get much better in my books than that.
---
Now that you mention it.  I've been to West Tek and have had a EXTRAORDINARY amount of Super Mutants appear once in a while.  The vat room/greenhouse area had at least three times the amount of Super Mutants. Must have left West Tek with 4-5 \*\*\* weapons.   3 combat shotguns dropped with pretty decent effects (no explosive though..) like 90% less weight, faster fire, etc.  No medics or creature specific effects, just AA, Executioner's, Furious, etc... Now I have to research shotguns.
---
Can confirm, use it all the time. Same with veil of mysteries.
---
Monthly Atoms primarily.  
---
Own "private world" so I can truly play Solo.  
---
To supporting BGS and Fallout 76.  
---
Exclusive player icon, and the free outfit. (I love it).
---
I uninstalled the game. Went back to Skyrim.
---
You stated in your post you never bought or played the game. So you have exactly zero experience playing the game. 
---
You are ridiculous- go annoy someone else.
---
Do dupers still exist on console? I thought that had been dealt with.
---
And what's your comeback for the rampant cheaters in NW?
---
Yep, I do all of what you have described. It's fun.
---
Cant believe people still play this game
---
Subscribed for the Atoms.  
---
And to support BGS and Fallout.
---
This is possibly the 2nd best PVP arena I’ve seen, behind this one: https://youtu.be/6RtECgk6zOE
---
If that guy is your friend, I hope you have no enemies. 😀
---
Bah, you don't play. The x01 calibrated shocks have been a plan for awhile.
---
Sweet. I like this weapon.
---
The harpoon gun, in my experience, is only good with the explosive effect on it. It becomes incredibly powerful. It’s even better if it has bloodied explosive.
---
Ah thats some solid insight! I appreciate it. Definitely going to be getting my hands on a Junkies one then. Would you say a Junkies build is better for doing the Vault 94 for getting strangler PA?
---
Well put. Dayumn. Makes me rethink few thinks I thunk.
---
Hardware id ban them all
---
Yeah qe is nice with flechettes. I have one and the ie too. The ie doesn't even need heavy perks, put in demolition.
---
I've become nearly addicted to my Vampiric Explosive double barrel, but I'm also slowly building up some bloodied gear to play around with, so yeah,  down with that.
---
Play stupid games, Win stupid prizes. Sounds like a grade a moron probably telling half the story. What type of genius exploit Hunter would test shit on their main account where they've spent money?
---
This may be a long shot, but did you recently acquire new mutations without using Class Freak? Any other changes to your character?
---
I recently went through the main quest line and ate my desired mutations as soon as I could get Starched Genes. Afterwards, I noticed I got very squishy, despite drastically improving my armor with several Vanguard pieces.  It got better once I started adding in class freak.
---
Also, I learned that shotguns are hot garbage. For once, the community complained about something with no hyperbole. Shotguns are every bit as bad as the community described.
---
I dunno, just saying what I heard online. There were a few criticisms that seem to keep being repeated: too short, bad combat, only a few areas to explore. Basically seems like it mostly excels at being a conversation simulator
---
You can even see it in the bushes. Grinded out the costume today, totally worth it. Probably one of my favorites besides the bear outfit. [https://imgur.com/M8lecAV](https://imgur.com/M8lecAV)
---
I wear jangles bandana and the message pops up (prevented airborne disease).
---
sometimes i sneak in front of an enemy and they still dont see me
---
&gt;You didn't save $14 you dumb greedy pieces of shit. You lost a steady revenue stream and free community tools.
---
nnnngghhh I just got a boner
---
Have fun
---
Depends on how good bloodied PA user you are... But from what I can tell, junkies offers more survivability in PA due to full health and Serendipity nor proccing in PA anyway (which is the main reason that keeps bloodied uny folks alive).  
---
I did raids with vampire heavies; served me well.
---
I've played the game while it is kinda small I really like the combat.
---
I feel it's worth paying full price because it goes to a transparent studio, obsidian is making what  what the industry desperately needs, finished products that provide a experience as promised.
---
I got two in my vendor for 200 caps. screw the bots. I'll be on tomorrow if you wanna get em. 100 cap - Reddit discount
---
tanagra town is amazing, i fortunately had my camera with me and took some cool pics there
---
the flight helmet, atom space suit also have no downsides but protect from airborne disease. you'll die get diseases though even in a regular gas mask.
---
the base of this game is crashing
---
There are alway some QEs available on M76; though very, very expensive (and rightly so). I traded three top legendaries for one, back in spring, but no regrets. Or you might get lucky with purv or vending machine...
---
i want to be able to buy so many
---
I have 5 extra I think, 2 extra pants, lots of clean ranger outfits. The pirate outfit dropped 3 times with the hats. Fireman 3 times. The rare ones for me were the shorts (never dropped, had to trade for it) and pumpkin rack plan (twice). Keep em until next year. Remember my fach plans sold out when vendors were released.
---
If you play on all 5 characters then you can, plus I’m buying a lot of scrip legendary with caps as caps are much easier to get
---
Oh man, I can imagine a good vampiric would come in handy. I like to think I'm alright in PA but theres still plenty of room for me to improve with them. 
---
What Heavies do you mainly use if you don't mind my asking?
---
it does
---
Obsidian got absorbed by Microsoft, they're not gonna be a transparent studio for long lol. If you want to check them out before they got tangled up with a company who has bad practices then check out the games they had to get crowdfunded when they were going under, Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2. PoE 2 came out in 2018 but v few people bought it because people don't like real isometric RPGs anymore even though it's considered one of the best RPGs of all time, much more in depth than Outerworlds
---
Interesting. But now a serious question, since I know nothing of irl guns. Would you be able to silence the Lmg?
---
Seems fine to me.
---
Nice. I think my furious explosive harpoon gun does about 1800 before adrenaline or the furious effect procs, so those in with bloodied and it gets silly.
---
Yeah, I'm gonna take a pass on that one.
---
Welcome to Thunderdome!
---
lol, they should really clean the house when it comes to some people working on fallout 76.
---
I have the marine tactical helmet plans on PS4 is this not the right plan?
---
I don't understand why you used the word "us" at the end. You are clearly not over it since you spend your time posting about a game you don't play. That is kind of the opposite of being "over it".
---
&gt;They charged money for a broken product that was not as advertised.
---
Almost an entire year now and people still aren't seeing a pattern, at some point you need to take responsibility and stop letting a company ream you. That or stop acting surprised that it keeps happening.
---
I recently (today) came back to the game as well. I lasted about 30mins before getting bored and uninstalling the game. There's still nothing worth doing at endgame.
---
Aye I suppose it’s different depending on the country and state. Americans actually have it slightly easier though, the price for the sub is quite a bit higher in other currencies.
---
Well, I do pvp mostly nowadays, so anything from QE Harpoon, AAE Flamer, FE/E25 50 cal, VE GP, EE minigun, AA/E25 LMGs, that kind of stuff... For pve nothing beats that VE gatling and VE/25 50 cal, though.   
---
Not running junkies/bloodied, as I really like my full health and those utility prefixes.
---
I've been slow grind tanking it for awhile with that VE double barrel (Oh, plus I'm also Grounded and one piece of armor has damage reduction from bots as well - I spent Mischief Week in the assaultrons and legendary sentry's faces) but going the one-shot route would also be fun for an alternative.
---
4 and 76 gameplay wise were identicle though and also character models, gun/clothing models and most the enemies to, they just copy n pasted the game. I dont see how 76 can be better than 4 when its exactly the same but without any story mode or interactable NPCs. If you had more fun on 76 fair enough, but its in no way an improvement on 4.
---
Can't you see? people don't care or know about pvp in this game. Bet that 'Karen' didn't even know what seeking revenge was seeing how she kept seeking revenge while she clearly didn't want no pvp.  These are the people you beat. I'm so proud of you. Best pvper ever
---
Starting to think Bethesda has employed 6 accounts to downvote any negative 1st comments. A pattern is emerging 🤔...
---
“I’m going to pay a hundred real world dollars so people don’t take my virtual loot”.
---
Yeah, I thought they were going to do another ESO and bring it all the way back. But no, they just want to suck as much money as they can out of what is left of their player base. Then move on, the game will be a zombie until someone decides to throw a switch and make it an offline only game because the server cost is not worth it. Wait, no they won't just give it to the community, they's probably just shut it off.
---
&gt;And they would rather lose a customer who was that die hard fanboy and has spent hundreds of dollars buying atoms, has purchased 6 accounts
---
People like you are the reason the games have gone to shit, why make a decent, complete game, when idiots like you will pour money into it, making up for the loss of true gamers
---
I run with a TSE lever action rifle, explosive anti-armor handmade and a handmade that does more damage to ghouls. Once I got these weapons, I have not gone with anything else. Only annoying thing is switching the perk cards between commando and rifleman.
---
Oh snap you got your hands on a QE harpoon, I Envy ya! Haven't had much like finding people willing to part with theirs on ps4. FE 50 cal I can picture being highly effective. 
---
Yeah, I really like having more health, which is exactly why I'm looking into JE. I feel as though its an all around solid choice if you want to do bit of both. It'll hold its own in pvp but there are certainly better heavy options for it.
---
 *Unyeilding anything* seem to have disappeared from vending machines, must all be on trade hubs now that I've never used.
---
This. Shareholder-type thinking has only ever ruined games and franchises, but they don't get it because they're don't know anything about the community.
---
there is a discord for this "need friend", this is the makeshift version of FO1st after all but at least it won't erase your junk
---
3 star legendary lever action rifle lvl 45 when I’m only lvl 26
---
As I've just posted elsewhere, QEH is the best damn weapon in game.  
---
And yes, junkies is definitely the way to go; several of my pals run it (both armored and PAed) and swear on it.
---
At this rate we can be happy if Fallout ever pulls back. I have this creeping suspicion that 76 was the last title, atleast for a while. They'll just milk it and the constant (and subpar) Fallout Merch until it's dried out.
---
' grubby hands of bethesda ' 
---
' The idea is to get the game away from them'
---
But Bethesda own the game and are making money from it, no company is going to give away intellectual property or product that is still making a profit, just because people don't want to pay for it.
---
This sub is whats left of the stans. Those types do not care about your opinions or reasoning. I have an 11 year old Reddit account but the mods here placed me on a 10 minute limit between posting because they do not like my opinions.
---
&gt;YOU ARE DOING THAT TOO MUCH. TRY AGAIN IN 5 MINUTES.
---
I wonder how shareholders of a company would feel about knowing that random internet strangers can take their IP and turn it into a toxic community and give their property a bad image. One they have spent millions trying to create. Emails to those companies might help? 
---
Regardless.
---
They are not going to do real private servers because then they would not be able to make money off the mods.
---
What did you have to trade for that beast? I had the pleasure of trying my buddies  QEH for a little bit and man, Nothing I've used since can compare to how much of a blast that thing was.
---
Well if you're reverse engineering the server code, it won't matter where it's hosted.
---
Naw it’s cool! Haha 👋🏻
---
Its an AMD Ryzen Problem.
---
Honestly, I never though another gaming publisher could be as spoilt or greedy as EA / Activision. 
---
But, Bethesda is taking things to a whole different level.  You wouldn't be wrong in calling it borderline 'Stealing'   It's pathetic.  There are so many things illegal in practise when it comes to Bethesda and the Fallout 76 situation. It blows my mind consumer protection agencies are not all over this shit-show.
---
It was fun to read. Interesting to see where it was heading. Iv  ever seen a s.s. in the forest before it would have been a supprise lol I remember seeing my first one in the ash heap when I was around level 20 I was like ....oh no lol
---
Why you don't present your case as to why they're worse and we'll tell you if it holds muster. We're not going to do your job for you.
---
how do you get caps
---
Still sad that this isnt a thing, while a flipping Scorchbeast attack is..
---
How sad that they purchase 1st and then peace out in what, not even a month since it's launch? All that wasted money that could have gone to something more worthwhile.
---
The Outer Worlds is pretty fun. I'm glad they didn't put DRM on it. Which made it pretty funny to me since you could download and play the game the day before it came out if you decided not to pay for it.
---
If you didn't like it then, you won't like it now.
---
If you liked it then and can endure the lag, crashes and bugs, you will probably like it now.
---
Buttressed,  marine armor needs to be crafted then scrapped to learn this mod. Significantly this mod improves the reasonable value of marine armor.
---
You are not end game until you can mod and resell.
---
What you're asking for will probably never happen. I really doubt that there will be true mods on truly private servers. You might have a private world instance with some paid mods but that's it.
---
You might just be best off not waiting and just moving on.
---
Yeah, I can't quite understand why the XP for kills is so small. It encourages bush hiding over confrontation. More often than not I'd let someone slip past me, because the rewards and risk for getting into a shoot-out were nowhere close to the benefits of sitting around in shrubbery.
---
You're kidding me. So even the armour is bloody pay2win. They couldn't stomach following the same rules as a gas mask. Had to have extra benefits...
---
Saw this earlier with a friend on PC. I was telling them how it looked like giant paintball arena lol.
---
If EVERY other mask in the game gave -2 perception you might have a point...
---
But that's not the case, is it?
---
Got three Bear Arms since the purveyor started handing them out. One is SS Str and reduced weight. The other two were both nocturnal.
---
Three top legendaries (AAE radium and others I don't remember) from a very greedy trader, but no regrets...
---
Sentinel Assassin high hp (12+end) commando build, with a ffr handmade/fixer, something to auto snipe with, a railway, and a tesla for stronger opponents or if you don't really want to pvp right now. Or heavy weapons high endurance strangler heart. There's a fair bit of wriggle room in the builds and weapons that can work, less so with armour, and some people still find success using bloodied builds, even if they have fallen with the damage cap change. Look up a yt video by 'ragechronicles' concerning pvp, titled 'A Late Introduction to Fallout 76 PvP'. That's a solid primer by some guys who pvp a lot on console. The best weapons you will need are super difficult to trade for, but if you have good pve weapons (bloodied), you can probably trade them for good pvp weapons (aa/j/f/v + ffr or explosive).
---
A lot of people have been criticizing Bethesda since the game released, but this sub generally ignored them
---
Pro tip: just get aquaboy and dive down grafton lake. Easy lazy exp
---
A huge thing is the bloodied build (bolstering or unyielding armor, and bloodied weapons). That's what I see by far the most. Usually bloodied explosive. I also know junkie weapons are pretty meta. On xbox it mostly seems bloodied melee, tho I've heard that's a bit different on other systems
---
Since there Is a damage cap, you want good fire rate for PVP. Some automatic rifle or heavy weapon. People tend to use assassin, bloodied, faster fire, vampire legendaries. 
---
Armor tends to be sentinel, Cavallier, unyielding. 
---
PVE, anything will do. Bloodied, Junkie and instigating builds work fine. Unarmed stealth unyielding Is the most powerful thing ever.
---
Camps with lighting kills my fps, some people fill the camps with every light they have, dreadful.
---
You forgot "Ackchyually".
---
There are lots of equipment that do the exact same thing. Pretty sure most bandanas and the surgical mask.
---
&gt;I haven't played in a while, but I've been holding out for wastelanders. Although posts like this really make me less excited for it.
---
Gamers are hopeless. You all deserve worse imo, no wonder companies treat you like this. You'll literally keep buying their shit no matter what lmao
---
I play it like hide and seek. Start somewhere remote, this will give you time to search around and plan your movements.
---
But that has been clear for many years already.  
---
Bethesda have been very big believers that mods are slashing their DLC revenue. They have been vocal about that many years ago. Afterwards they tried to strongarm the Skyrim community into paid mods but turned the decision around because I think people at Bethesda were genuinely afraid of their lives if they didn't. That's where they learned they were going to have to do it in steps.  
---
So they announced FO4 and that modding tools would only come later. Which turned out to be much much later. Much later than when enough people were still playing it and that the poor reception could be fixed by mods.  
---
Then FO76 comes and now without any modding tools with the excuse that they can't because it's multiplayer.  
---
If anyone who believes ES6 will have mod support is reading this; snap out of it. It will not. Bethesda thinks modding is the enemy of DLC revenue.  
---
Realistic people understand that mods are needed for Bethesda's broken games to make them playable and that modding, including content mods, only increase their DLC revenue. Bethesda does not.  
---
Anti-vaxers believe vaccines cause autism. Flat Earthers believe the earth is flat. Bethesda believes mods cut their DLC revenue. Logic does not apply, it just is like that.  
---
Bethesda has been making bad games both in gameplay, the engine and business decisions. It's that simple and it is continuously getting worse.  
---
It's frustrating for everyone who loved their games and who sees the potential. But when there is nothing you can do, you have to help yourself and just step away from the situation. There are many greener pastures out there.
---
I'm on Xbox, only crashed once. Sucks that it had to happen as I was about to finish the beast game if NW I've ever played! But I'm not bitter...
---
Don't even see them, overrides but does not unequip. It does the same thing to the bomb collar
---
Come now, they can be creative with their monetization schemes, shouldn't be that hard to imagine... Sure we don't want them to get paid for mods that other people labor on. And no one is asking them to give away their intellectual property either, no one can or should make money from their games, only them. I agree with that.  
---
But you can still give the game to the players, Like Fo/NV/Skyrim ect, and have them enjoy it the way they want to. Money should still go to bethesda sure. But I won't pay 10+ dollars for recolors of skins. That is insane. I played Atlas while ago and you are able to color and dye any parts of your ships and clothing. They probably have already added that basic feature like dyes to FO 76 by now so this might just be a mute point. But when a game actively tries to limit you and put you behind a paywall after you've already bought a full priced AAA title game, nuts, lunacy.   
---
Hand over the servers and the game and figure out a way to monetize that. Might be difficult sure, but that's is why they have millions of dollars and tons of people at their backs right? Not to give us a rip off of what everyone wanted.  
---
Just know, there is a collection of people that are actively working to take as much money from you as possible. And FO76 is a breathing example of how to do it. You can't let them think they can continue this. And not to mention subverting our expectations of private worlds instead of private servers.
---
Scamming is the reason i will never do player to player vending outside of a vending machine.
---
If by “without any micro transactions” you mean, without a monthly subscription, that isn’t going to happen. They said a year ago IF they had private servers, then they would be a service provided by Bethesda. That’s not going to change.
---
They will happen... but they also said at the same time that it would be a service provided by Bethesda for $.
---
Great story though!
---
And Leader of the Pack spawns a total of three 1*'s, which drop level five or ten weapons or armor. All told, each run is worth 9 to 15 scrip if you get all three before someone else jumps on the event.
---
Only trivially obtainable ones do.
---
Oh wait,  the things are trivially obtainable - so what IS your problem?
---
Their initial sales pitch was that IF private servers ever came about, it would be a service provided by Bethesda...
---
&gt; I want to continue to like bethesda games and if do move on it would be that I don't touch any of their junk again. But I'd like to think that they do still want to make great games in a great way. I'd hate for them to continue to prove me wrong, day after day. 
---
I get where you're coming from. I've been that way for a long time.
---
For me, Fallout 76 was meant to be the redemption arc for the missteps of Fallout 4 the stuff that happened since. It's been a steep downward slide for me and there is nothing I've seen that is worth redeeming.
---
For me, Wastelanders is the last chance, not just for 76 but for Bethesda overall. 
---
Look at their track record and apply that to Starfield. There will definitely be a "micro"transaction store. They will launch the game in a very buggy state and give zero F's about it. It may come with a multiplayer option. If it does, it'll have pay2win mechanics. There will be a bunch of cynical product tie-ins that'll equally be of poor quality and they will be unresponsive to customer support issues and crippling bugs within the game.
---
How could you possible expect anything less from Bethesda? 
---
It's why Wastelanders is the make or break for me. If, even after the approx 3-5 month delay, for a year where they didn't deliver on slightly half of their 2019 roadmap and they STILL screw things up? Why would you ever come back to such a company?
---
Read the post again you stupid fool.
---
I have one calibrated Shock on my X-01 Armour.
---
The enclave sells them,they are as rare as Rocking Horse Shit.
---
They can supposedly drop from SQB or the Queen.
---
Everybody knows they are a plan duhhhhhhhhhhh.
---
Seriously get a life.
---
Yes
---
Yes the one that looks a 50cal. You can get it from terminals.
---
How much would you pay for it?
---
Fantastic. I hope people have full and utter administrative powers, full access to everything the game has to offer with the addition of mods in no way tied to Bethesda. Then we ought to be seeing some great times ahead for the game.  
---
I do hope they don't try to police or govern these kinds of private servers as if people weren't capable of it themselves. As they have time and time again proven they aren't capable of even governing themselves much less impose their greed further onto the community.
---
he is asking for calibrated shocks and tesla coils - both ultra rare plans. Shocks are being sold for 30k on market 76  .
---
They've been acting stupid ever since they decided that the game was finished and worthy of being released.
---
The private servers have only been out for a little over two weeks since October 23rd and not a month as you stated.  Beth announced a couple days later that they will have a patch to lockout uninvited friends from joining a private server and making it where you can invite them.
---
Your post and comments here sounds like this is a more "I hate Bethesda" soap box than a true query regarding the private servers.
---
My god, you're right.
---
The fact that cheat engine works, in a multiplayer game, means the devs are utterly incompetent and shouldn't do anything that involves connecting one user with another. All gameplay code should be server-side.
---
Zenimax learned this the obvious way with ESO.
---
Interesting, so they removed the tooltip info but not the effect.
---
"Text chat? That would be 150$."  
---
"Perk loadouts? That would be 200$."
---
"thank you very much for the feedback, and keep requesting new QoL features so we can put them behind paywalls"
---
\-Greedthesda.
---
Nope, and if Beth had some sort of limit thing in place, which prevented a sale like this happening, same with vendor machines, then it wouldn’t have happened at all.
---
But note that I don’t actually say it’s Beth’s fault?
---
I hope more people would knoW the game before post things like "it's p2w" blablabla. Not talking about OP post but the answer.
---
Most of the helmets that full cover the head prevents airborne disease without downside. I'm using an assaultron head atm, guess what, it prevents me from airborne diseases. Even considering that the helmet is open.
---
Before whining, people should try their favorite helmet, go at one of the abandoned mine that has a big chimney, and stand on top on if. If your character doesn't cough, congrats it prevents airborne disease.
---
Gasmask shouldn't have a debuff in the first place since it's cosmetic only. But gasmask and veil are not the only solutions, even worst, few people know that basic bandana prevent airborne disease too...
---
The system is not designed to transfer things from one character to another, so if your doing it, your doing it in a hacked way or you have 2 accounts.
---
Either way, your taking a risk.
---
Running 2 instances of the game was not meant to be stable.
---
If your on 2 PC’s then thats the lick of the draw.
---
tl;dr
---
cuck chokes on Beth load
---
So true,
---
The Sky runners are funny as f\*\*k.
---
Out of nowhere a Ghoul will appear and runs across the [Sky.It](https://Sky.It) is a sight to behold.
---
And I do think their intended impression was that yes there would be private servers governed by the players with their own optional mods. How else were we suppose to interpret that? And I do believe Todd had said yes there would be private servers to come, not If. But yeah I could be mistaken. Hearing what I wanted to hear opposed to what was said.
---
I wear a camo too and it does protect me from airborne diseases. I can stay afk in smoky mines and even the notification pops.
---
I have 2 accounts, both paid for. I sell an item from one character to another. My PC can handle running two instances at the same time (one in Ultra, one on Low).
---
Like I said, this time I was distracted and did it wrong. Normally I works out just fine. 
---
BUT, like people have complained with the vendors, if there was a limit trigger that prevented the transaction then this wouldn’t have happened.
---
I’m frustrated that it did, and needed to let off steam.
---
Done that now, will earn the caps back easily enough.
---
Are you sure? I get this message often. I just restart app and I can logg in again.
---
commitment bro
---
Very few helmets has the description. My tip : if it cover the mouth emplacement in your pipboy, it works.
---
That message just happens sometimes. I’m amazed you’ve managed to play for so long without seeing it!
---
If you just keep trying you should get I eventually.
---
Fingers crossed for you!
---
I get that message when the servers are off line for maintenance, etc.  If you've been banned you will get a notice of the ban from Bethesda.
---
I mean, open a support ticket? Why come here and complain? If its legit, and your hiding what your doing wrong, welcome to “caughtsville”
---
If not they will fix it.
---
Beth, fixed two issue I had within 12 hours each time.
---
Maybe look to solve problems rather than jump on here to complain.
---
Why the fuck would you use cheat engine for any cause? Jesus christ. No wonder Bethesda's employees don't post here anymore.
---
It's to make the most brutal game of hide and seek you'll ever play!
---
The official release is November 14th
---
I’m not going to trade two weapons for that. And I’m more of a damage dealer :)
---
I am fucking tired of these whiney ass players......
---
Move along, leave the sub , have a happy life.
---
The Star Wars fans are the same......good lord.
---
My friends pick them up and trade them off quickly. For a dedicated build it probably works great, but for me its overhyped.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b7oyri/comprehensive_power_armor_and_mods_guide/   ?
---
Does the PA still freeze other people nearby?  My teammates always request that no one wear it because it bugs us out.
---
No go play something else people tell you to play.
---
This. It's a common error. If you did indeed get banned, Bethesda would tell you outright in no uncertain terms via email.
---
that doesn't make logical sense. one because, without their report, Bethesda would never be able to find out. and two because their anticheat literally just scans for the words "cheat" and "engine". that's it. anyone trying to maliciously exploit the game would use their own software, not CE.
---
that's what they were banned for.
---
No move on.
---
Nope, I thought it was it yesterday but it's not this one
---
Well, you know better.
---
Both are solid in their own way, with the piercing magazines and the perk i expect your Two shot to outdamage the AA one over time but testing might be needed.
---
I live literally in the same town center as Bethesda HQ in Rockville MD (ironically they’re not even in Bethesda lol) So if you want me to relay the message of how much they suck for you to them in person I will lol. So angry that they did this to you
---
True, my point is, people should just wait for the PTS
---
played now like 100 games, never encountered one.... soooooo there cant be that frequent.
---
There could have been a ton of other factors in that test with all the perks and legendary effects. Dataminers read the code for the effect.
---
Yea lets go ask the active sub if they have the game installed for the sub.
---
This Sub has some really stupid posts,
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/DCDeacon/status/1034107747812425728

TSEs arent that great - havent been for a long time ( after nerf)
---
Cool cheers mate
---
Same though.
---
Learn how to make stimpacks early
---
Get these cards early

Fast travel discount card
---
Super duper
---
Green thumb
---
Be careful and build only the cards for the character you want. Decide now what your going to play as, stealth, strength, gunner.
---
Easiest  is melee strength.
---
I literally never use words like these but I can't find any other word to describe Bethesda and FO76 other than a cancer. To the company, to the fallout franchise, to the moddibg community which has kept betgesda's game relevant.
---
It’s sad that he got hit by the ban. Especially since it seems that he had good intentions, but generally speaking if you are going to white hat something you have an agreement in place(with bethesda in this case) about the fact that you’re going to be doing this first. 
---
An extreme example would be hacking retailer’s database of credit cards/customer info and finding they are all unencrypted (remember when this was a “scare” with bethesda?  Lol). Even if you were truly altruistic about it - the fact you were doing it in the first place is red flag city to a company and usually is enough to warrant a ban based upon something in the tos.
---
I was unfortunately walking to the stash box when the server froze up and disconnected.
---
He was there the day before Mischief night started also.
---
I was kinda weirded out by seeing a new NPC since I have been playing since beta!
---
I've never had a good experience with the support team. My characters were deleted and they didn't even have a reason, just a copy and paste apology. It's unacceptable for a live model game to not be responsible with player data.
---
Rather than going for kills, why not just out last?  
---
My favourite matches tend to be a glorified hide-and-seek. I sneak, I stalk, I avoid the slightest sound and get really good at killing trash with the crossbow.  
---
I also do that as a solo run as I don't wanna burden my team.  
---
But yeah, if not enjoying it one way, maybe try something else?
---
Scorched beast queen, and most player vendors sell the quiet regularly that I've come across.
---
Open ......a .......TICKET.
---
I'm still waiting on a response. I'll update if it's just their error.
---
This was my understanding as well. There was some potential dupe with private worlds, but as I understand it, that too has been addressed. I don't know the details of how it was supposed to work though so I can't say for sure. 
---
But the throwables dupe is still active. Caught two people in one day doing it. One had 10k steel in their death bag (foolish enough to be doing it in a workshop). The other had the building outside the WS station filled with nuke mines.
---
I know that. I forgot Beta was October and release was November
---
Thats the idea of the cap limit.
---
Hoarding caps is useless.
---
Flaw? Why the hell would you need more than 30k in caps?
---
I run all day on 15-20 and never run out.
---
I like to call it the dead Radroach slide. Hard to target but hilarious to watch.
---
Honestly, it really is vendor hopping.
---
Workshops takeover/defends.
---
Players. Most people will give away common plans
---
Rad resist and a few radaways will have you good to go into a nuke zone wearing regular armor. I frequently go into the nuke zone with marine or scout armor.  The rads are only about 4/sec and you have that base resistance regardless of armor. 
---
It even stacks with power armor and Rad-X. Also very helpful against Radium rifles.
---
I would love to get a bloodied / Swing Speed Bear Arm, but no luck from the purveyor yet!
---
You sound horrible.
---
I've purposely avoided duping and other exploits like the plague, besides just ruining the experience to me, I don't want my account banned. It just sucks they do this all so haphazardly with no warning, information, or option to defend.
---
Cool, there's also a perk that gives +650 Rad res. But I didn't have it yet
---
Well acid cannot be improved with perks or legendary effect. It's all about rate of fire or number of hitting shots.
---
For example you could even use a harpoon with flachette and deal an absurd amount of acid and damage,but you'd have to reaload a lot(unless quad).
---
In pve you won't really rely on acid to kill enemies,specially with strong weapons,but it's a very good bonus for bosses like the queen.
---
You don't say.... 
---
That's the perk I was referring to.  It's called Rad Resistant.
---
Digital Extreme is fine too, although its more like indie corp
---
Right? Hopefully wastelanders pulls it together
---
I honestly cant say I feel bad for people who are now getting burned by Bethesda after the repeated bullshit that is now affecting it's most hardcore fans, it's obvious that this game is a lost cause and will only continue to cause hear break and lost time, they dont deserve our time anymore even in regards to the npc story addon, keep playing the game at your own risk and god speed to those who still remain unshaken.
---
Sorry didn't catch the first part 😅
---
Yeah, I know that. But getting one has been a kind of goal for me since the game released.
---
Been watching the game burn for a while now. this is funny because even the most loyal still get burned. when will y'all learn?
---
How can you play for a month of the release when it only came out a little over two weeks ago?
---
Easy first hand example of performance issues:
---
Last night three of my friends and I played for a few hours. Between 4 players had the game crash on us a couple dozen times and you'd think we had been doing something crazy but no we had been exploring the map a bit to discover some new areas we needed and/or traveling to and from our camps that's it. The client was choppy all night with minor lock ups throughout the entire game night for everyone in the team, large amounts of NPCs bugging out moving in place being unable to take damage, dead NPCs moving in place, live NPCs moving in dead corpses, and the list goes on. 
---
Just because you don't experience issues reported doesn't mean they don't happen to others and often even with client settings set to low or medium.
---
Yo, I'm just getting a quicker response from someone who has maybe waited longer with the same situation considering support is constantly understaffed. I check my email regularly which is why I noticed the ban, I even went and checked for anything else sent to me and there's nothing since my last ticket which is STILL awaiting a response past 'we don't have the tools'. Sorry your offended by my initiative in seeking an answer?
---
r/iamverysmart
---
My vending machine if you are on Xbox. I sell literally all plans @10 caps.
---
I used mine yesterday in a queen fight with a conbat shotty ti cripple and bath her in acid and  had no problem.ps4.
---
I cannot use my Strangler PA on SBQ, Impostor etc because it freezes/CTDs the game for me.
---
I could on my Intel CPU PC but it complete buggers my AMD CPU PC.
---
With a BE Gatling Plasma it take mere seconds, with a slower RoF weapon (like a regular gatling) it takes longer, but eventually I freeze/CTD.
---
Given the circumstances I do not have a lot of faith on this being fixed.
---
Before posting suggestions or report bugs ask yourself this:  
---
Can this suggestion be monetized somehow?  
---
Does this bug prevent you from spending/purchasing atoms?
---
If yes is a valid answer to any of these questions you have a chance of getting a reply. Else no, there is no point.
---
May not be Meta but I have a full health sneaky non-automatic rifle build that 1 shots just about every normal enemy in the game.
---
 It can hit up to 4K damage but consistently hits for 2k.  In my opinion that's more than enough damage for me. I wouldn't trade my build for anything.
---
Only downside is I cant team up with anybody because my damage immediately goes to shit. 
---
 Also if an enemy is engaged fighting with something else(npc or human) I only do half damage even if im full sneak.
---
Wouldn't you be mad if your characters were deleted and the only response you get for your tickets are generic copy+paste 'sorry but we can't do anything to help' or even tell me WHY they were deleted? I have 0 faith in their support team, I just replied so they can't in the future use my lack of response against my account. Ticket closes after 4 days without a reply.
---
I am on Xbox actually! I’d be interested in buying from you
---
Would you like the screenshots of my previous tickets and their pointless replies? If you understood how ineffective their team is you might understand my frustrations.
---
How much would you pay for this feature? You know that Bethesda is going to sell it back to you if they do it.
---
Frustrated or not, you shouldn’t talk to people like that. All it does is make people less likely to want to help.
---
Picking fights, destroying bases, and killing players. You're proud of this?
---
It's a very common error. 
---
I take it you didn't attempt to log in a second time?
---
 This is how dumb people spread misinformation to dumb people.
---
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
---
I would say they might finally be trying to do something about the hacking that is plaguing PC? Which might extend to, and terminate, the moda that already exist for QoL stuff in adventure mode.
---
So you fuck up and blame Bethesda? Why am I not surprised.
---
Read my other post?
---
Hmm, well I haven't seen many hackers about now, so maybe that's it?
---
It is, the fact that you have to wander the wasteland with 20% hp or less, is stupid RP.
---
I wish they'd nerf Bloodied, or better yet increase all the other builds that are really subpar atm.
---
Maybe. Until the start itemizing ALL of the changes they are making we'll never know for sure lol
---
it happens once in a while, for no apparent reason, just try again or close/start the game, all should be fine then
---
They played out of the hope that it will get better. A hope that has been dragged out to the middle of the woods late at night and shot.
---
only if your a limited individual - we actually have already hosted over 400 events from escorting a crazed atom priest to bos versus enclave attacks on workshops - of course you have to actually be able to make friends to do these things
---
I wish I could get so over a game that I come to a reddit page dedicated to said game and make stupid posts all day long.
---
 Then people would absolutely know that I am over it!
---
Why are people still wasting time with this shit hole of a game? No offence but Bethesda will never listen to you guys as you continue to pay them for screwing you over. 
---
I stayed longer than most and tried to excuse some of the shortcomings but it's clear they are trying to milk the fans for as much as possible before they let this game crash and burn. 
---
Who knows if Wastelanders will ever actually launch, it'll probably be delayed again as they continue to double down on monetizing this game as much as possible.
---
no its pretty unbalanced.  from base weapons being unbalanced to legendary effects, they definitely need to do a pass on the weapons.
---
a great example for weapons is the AR vs handmade.  base model vs base model the handmade beats the AR in every stat but reload iirc.
---
as far as eddects go i like to compare berzerkers and bloodied, both in theyory should require a large sacridice (dr/hp) to be efficent, bt zerker lags so far behimd for similar risks
---
Right so like nothing at all.
---
No comparison, they are both shitty human beings.
---
Glowing Pustuals desease makes you take more damage from rads, that combined with rad worms is a deadly combo.
---
Sadly you don’t.
---
I saw battlebot pop up yesterday night so I fast travel to it and finished it. As I was walking away the messenger started so I figured I'm already here. Stupid bot got stuck in some flaming pit and just kept bouncing up and down as it took damage. Couldn't do anything about it,  fast traveled to somewhere else. Saw it on the map 10 minutes later and went back to it just to see if it moved and didn't. Event failed.
---
I didn’t realize I’m no longer able to store my junk before I go out to take a workshop and can only do this with 1st. TIL..
---

No. You don't actually have 1 server, you have a random one when you log in. Your server closes when you log out to menu, causing it to shutdown immediately if no one is there or give ownership to another F1st user.
---
Heh, yeah guess it's best to wait and see what happens, well thanks anyhow!
---
Check your email for a notification from beth telling you why you, your banned. If no email then its a common enough bug I’ve experienced which goes away after a fee minutes. Try turn on &amp; off your xbox/router . Close relaunch game etc..
---
The problem is that there are so many perks that give benefits to having low health, along with the adrenal reaction mutation and unyielding armor effect. It’s as if they intended bloodied to be the end game build. There’s literally no perks or armor effects that benefit a berserker or junkies build.
---
What exactly are these “good pieces of equipment” that are taking up
---
Space in your stash? There is no need to have a stash full of weapons and definitely no reason to hve multiple armor sets.
---
Forest treasure maps
---
What same location?
---
This is the truth of the matter. Drop rates are too low for all these weapons to be legit. I’m grateful that dupers flooded the market with gear. Otherwise the end game grind would be much less fun.
---
Sending a PM
---
just do 360s to stay in-game and keep the workshops
---
They don’t use events to reward players like other games they use them to shove the atomic shop up our donkey
---
It doesn't freeze you.. it freezes up other players around you.

SBQ
---
Ah okay, just whenever those sort of things happen and I hear there's ban waves or stuff its puts me on edge that I somehow done something wrong, especially after what happened to that Map76 guy, man I feel bad for him
---
I usually have a ton of Camp plans stopped from doing treasure maps. Between 15 and 25 caps each depending on the original price.
---
Don't pay more than 40 or 50 caps for common Camp plans. A lot of people put them in their vending machines at the standard value but there's also a ton of us that sell them cheap just to get rid of them. Just look around.
---
2 side of the same coin.
---
This is a silly an illogical argument. Does everyone here enjoy server hopping and constantly competing for resources due to areas constantly being cleaned out? If you strip away the Fallout lore and look at this based on mechanics you'd be annoyed to know that there are tools that pin point exactly where everything is for compulsive players to loot and over price them on the market. If anything is stupid it's this post.
---
Thanks for the heads up. I was on the fence about subscribing but not anymore.
---
my ultimate aim, master plan one might say, is to make devs and CM's see these posts and maybe have a slightly worse day and contemplate about their incompetencies and failures that drove so many of us away from this failure called fallout 76 :(
---
You’re doing something wrong if you only get 272 xp in 25 minutes.

Don't worry about it. Everybody understands what it takes to get clicks on YouTube gaming channels these days. Hello toxic gaming culture. It's a living for the creators. I choose not to support it so I unsubscribed.  You still show up on my recommended feed and your thumbnails say everything I need to know.

This.

100 dollars a year
---
no thats another additional 10 dollars + tip
---
Run the numbers and compare: https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
It's still a good deal (mostly) and you can farm the entire Private server/make a new one for events/own all workshops. It just takes time.

no game is amazingly balanced my man, I am having a blast with my shotgun with 250 DR prefix

Not as much as a Fixer with every legendary effect

It should be 2.... I wish it was 5. I want to spend some time actually exploring the vault, reading terminals and listening to all the holotapes.
---
The “BETA” came out last year late October.  Thing is, it was not a “BETA,” it was just early access to the game.  Not sure if you played back then but the game was a big shit fest.
---
I guess it could be argued they began their stupid decisions then by releasing a hot mess but at least they cleaned the game up the game the following months.  Now it seems like Bethesda just gives no fucks these days.
---
It will stay for around 15 minutes. After that it will give you a new server.
---
I have destroyed fools with that power fist!
---
You confuse what get clicks
---
Idk reloading u guess
---
Little do you know Junkies and Berserkers do have effects and cards, but not on purpose. Junkies has chem effect duration perk, and armor mods called Biocommesh. Berserkers has The ability to wear broken armor, so you get the effects still. You can pair DR perks with it like Barbarian and Body guard, plus Lifesaving armor with Revenant Perk. 
---
But I angry, these builds need perks and armor specifically for it.
---
Some people call that “Getting Ubisoft”.
---
4 monies
---
I don't know how you have your points and perks  set up, but bloodied isn't the only way to go. I run junkies on my 2 hand melee PA build and junkies on my sneak rifle vats build and I can 1 shot nearly all ghouls in the game. Pretty much the only thing that puts up any serious resistance is sheepsquatch and the queen.
---
&gt;Sure we don't want them to get paid for mods that other people labor on
---
Mod creators are still using Bethesda's intellectual property and have no legal ownership of the code edits they make using Bethesda's tools, if Bethesda want to, they have the right to sell on mods created in good faith by enthusiasts.
---
&gt; But I won't pay 10+ dollars for recolors of skins. 
---
Nor will I, but many do and that is part of Bethesda's business model.
---
&gt; behind a paywall after you've already bought a full priced AAA title game, nuts, lunacy 
---
It seem to be profitable lunacy.
---
&gt; Hand over the servers and the game and figure out a way to monetize that. 
---
May happen once the cash cow has run dry, but they are not obligated to do so.
---
Bethesda are a business and will do anything and everything to make as much money from their player base as possible, they will only change if the revenue stream dwindles. *Goodwill* it seems means little when profit is king.
---
But many still play and pay, I just don't think that many people really care that much about the hubbub we see on Reddit and a few AdSense sucking YouTube content creator's channels.
---
Oh wow, I didn’t know about broken armor working for berserker. That’s really interesting actually.
---
You do not need bloodied to feel powerful.
---
 I use a sneaky, non automatic full health rifle build.
---
 My normal shots hit for around 2k and can hit up to 4k per shot.  More than enough to one shot any normal enemy in the game.
---
Happens sometimes. It also happens when your client is not updated to date.
---
True enough.
---
Legally okay =/= normal people okay
---
Yes - A particularly annoying trend is being immediately spotted by simply swapping weapons. Ghouls at Whitspring are really good at it. Perhaps they can smell you? I use a Rad Shower regularly but it doesn't seem to help.
---
So it really is Fornite76
---
The game released around this time last year.
---
They definitely need to bring other builds up and add in new prefixes. Tbh I run bloodied weapons on the off chance I'm at low health, no keeping permanently sub 20% health and it still packs enough punch to play well.
---
According to multiple people it does, and I have yet to test it. I'm building up a Lifesaving armor set and berk weapons.
---
Ah good shout!, just checked if both were up to date and they were.
---
During the sale I did probably 30 rolls and got 4 to 5 fixers. So yeah, she is handing them out for sure.
---
I dunno man, I just use a handmade on my unarmed dude. Only reason I have it for is SBs and lazily killing trash mobs. You just need tank killer and a rank each in commando.
---
Are you switching to heavy guns or just using it for  SBs? If you're a bloodied character I'd use the lmg, otherwise assault rifle
---
Everyone complains about console-specific games, but they're some of the best games we have, and for a good reason.
---
Sort of depends on what you are trying to accomplish. Like do you just need something for flying enemies?
---
The lmg and 50 cal are both great.  Both are going to drain ammo really fast though, especially the lmg.  You aren't going to find much ammo for either and crafting ammo for either is pretty expensive resource wise.  They are both heavy weapons as well so the perks for them are in strength. I would assume being melee you would rather keep strength perk slots for melee perks. 
---
The assult rifle isn't too great, but the perks would fall into perception. Either rifleman or commando depending on semi or full auto.  Your best bet might be a max level, fully modded hunting rifle with a few rifleman perks.  Get sneak headshots and you are doing pretty decent damage at that point. Fire rate will be slow though.
---
All depends on what your goal is though like I said.
---
Thats why I uninstalled. Im watching this garbage fire from a distance.
---
Good idea, I'll have to redownload the game and check if my internet permits.
---
This is what I've seen as well. The world persists in some cases, but it's only for a period of time.
---
To give you an example, I was server jumping Camden park for the t51 headlamp bright mod. On my first run through I'd kill the scorched and run to the vendor to check out the  mods. Then I'd server jump. For the next, let's say 5 jumps, the schorched would be dead in the same spot, but the vendor would be different.
---
So some things persist while other thongs like the vendors do not. And this only occurs for a short time.
---
Yeah, I bought a TSE pump for 254 caps last night, times are a changin
---
ok i usually start at the train station and clear the row of houses on the way to the golf club. After golf club is done i move to the southern houses and then to the parking lot. After this is clear i return to the train station, rejoin the server and start over again. Usually enough time has passed for the ghouls to then respawn.
---
Ok.  I am not sure if I will change my build.  I guess at this point, I want to have some fun with guns.  My first 50 levels was using a marksman rifle before going melee.  I would like to absolutely destroy those pesky yao gui though at range.  Thanks
---
I have a life.
---
I defended Fallout 76 for so long because I really did enjoy it and have fun. I was able to look past a lot of the bugs and drama cause I believed Bethesda was really trying something new that would be a benefit later on. They lost my faith with the new pay for storage thing they started when they claimed they would never do something like that. I loved Fallout and I feel like Fallout 76 didn’t love us back.
---
Maybe a saturnalia celebration for 7 days, fuck Xmas, it's early November and I'm already tired of hearing about it
---
And how did this "escort" work out? Did someone come and shoot at him for 0-1 damage?
---
This guy has a 3 part post I found really useful. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/diji9v/discussion_a_guide_on_where_to_find_all_the_power/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
I attempted to log in several times.
---
No, I think I'll keep my melee build and just enhance with a really good gun.  In terms of more powerful, what would be better than any of those three?
---
During the sale had all 5 toons maxed,  4 toons went all 3* ranged, 1 3* armors. I got 4 fixers, a bloodied and a furious plus a medic and a mutant slayers. Since then I got one more! The furious is my sneak rifle's go-to, and I primed the 2 shot I got last. My friend's personal theory- carry what you want. In other words, you want fixers, bring a bunch of fixers with you, you want explosive? when you roll at Murmurgrr carry a bunch of explosive weapons. ( I did have 2fixers on my 1st toon to get a legendary one.)
---
Yes, they are pathetic at this point.
---
Infinite caps.
---
In that run yeah but had a few before that.
---
So technically they do sure. But there is nothing they can do to stop people from making mods and releasing them to people. Mod authors can't sell their mods, but they can take any of their created assets and code elsewhere and they don't have to pass it through Bethesda whatsoever. 
---
Their business model is shoddy and should be criticized. Just because something is profitable doesn't mean it should stay that way. Exercising our right to criticize them in hopes they change their model should be a priority. 
---
And no, you are right. They are not obligated to do something like that. Would it bolster someone's fading faith in them? Maybe, maybe a lot. And people ought to care about the direction the game they are playing is headed in. Maybe they want to really give us nice private servers and they are polishing the game for said time. I could only hope that is the case.
---
I’ve already got a full urban scout set that has one lifesaving, autostim, troubleshooter, mutant slayer and zealots that I use currently. It gives extra defense against anything that can shoot me essentially. Add blocker and lone wanderer and I’d still be quite durable with a berserkers build.
---
I'm doing this for the lulz really
---
One christmas event at the top of the world could be cool, and disturbing. Imagine having rose making a party for the anniversary of the destruction of Charlestown; or also a Christmas event at Charlestown, with a robot that was made to organize a Christmas party for the responders, just before the dam blew up, and that still obeys the task he was given all those years ago every Christmas. Idk, just some ideas.
---
In terms of fun I'd play around with the lmg or 50 personally.  I have and AA FFR  lmg that shreds crap. Stays in my stash until I really want to unleash craziness though.   Even if I had all the .308 on the server I would still run out of ammo lol
---
No particular offense, but those stories aren't unique. That is about half of all PvP in my experience. Also they way you relate it doesn't exactly cast you in the best light. Anyone at a workshop should totally know the deal though.
---
I recently switched my guy to junkies build, you can try that with explosive or ffr effect. TSE assault rifle is fine, but I would do a rank each of commando, ground pounder and tank killer. Junkies FFR fixer or handmade, or AA FFR if you don't want to mess with chems and addiction, then you could even drop tank killer perk. There's plenty of ways to go but those seem the easiest to deal with without too much character modifications
---
Even back then people didn't like the idea they would have to be hosted through them. It is that kind of monopoly without a 3rd party host to provide competition with them that people knew would be a problem.
---
And I like how he deflects the discussion away from those real issues saying just to get through the release as though he knew it was going to be bumpy from the start. It is that kind of behavior that should toss a red flag. Indicating they know they are doing something we wouldn't like and they'd do whatever it takes to keep people attentions away from those issues.
---
Still broke the toss by using an exploit
---
Thank you!
---
Ok thanks!
---
Bethesda need to release a good game, asap. They're losing customers and I can't imagine their stock value is getting higher. The community *hates* them.
---
The fasnacht masks did for me
---
I paid for the game.
---
I want Nuka Cola machine hidden door from the tattoo parlor.
---
In all honesty use them for trades. Best ballistic heavy weapon that deals a punch and conserves ammo is the gatling gun. Look for a B25 gatling gun, I usually like weight reduction on heavy. You can find 5mm ammo off of ghouls (around 25 rounds) and supermutants (around 100 rounds on the leader). Crafting ammo will be easy with the perk cards ammosmith and super duper. Your lmg is great, but hard to use as a primary weapon due to its ammo consumption and the .50 cal isn't great on accuracy  and can hurt you in close combat, also ammo is hard to come across.
---
Did you forget the /s?
---
Ok thank you!
---
Like it or not, that is what they said would happen. You are acting like they broke their promise when they did not.
---
You understand it's a company not a charity right? Suspensions have to follow legalities and maximise profits. No matter how shitty that might seem.
---
Atom shop only. I got refrigerated backpack and once you learn where to get the junk you need, only thing you're missing out on is some random junk jokes on repeat
---
A query against the server to see if the player you’re trading with has enough room in their caps inventory would do it, and I can’t believe you’re getting downvoted for suggesting such a simple fix.
---
Having a pile of guts chase you while making noises is also fun.
---
Yeah seems I’ve riled the ‘Leave Beth alone crowd’
---
Ironic as I’ve paid for 2 accounts, been playing since beta, have over 300 levels across 3 characters and have been very pro Beth on this sub.. but hey..
---
Rifle is ok, but I downvoted everyone that said juicehead (yes even myself).
---
Maybe your password was compromised? Contact support.
---
20 hours
---
I see, I just thought it was server lag
---
Have it be a wall option like the garage door, that would be super sweet!
---
I'm a bloodied melee and I really love my BE lever.   I've even sacrificed a few point into perception.
---
Had a similar issue last night playing in a group I'm normally able to kill them in the same level range as last night without issue or significant damage.  Died many times by a single ghoul two-shooting me of similar level to me last night like if I wasn't wearing any armor at all.
---
remember this post?
---
and bethesda just keeps going full throttle xD
---
Oh no, I specifically tried to stay away from the words promise because we all know that what is said matters very little to what they provide. And if you recall there was plenty of confusion as to what kind of game it would be even up to the release of it. They were shady back then and so far seem not to have changed much.   
---
And I do think Todd said mods and private servers which are yet to be provided. So I'm waiting on that part. But yeah, they sure are doing a bang up job at providing whatever service it is they are providing now.  
---
I am trying to act like a patient dissatisfied customer. So yeah I guess you hit the nail a bit on the head there, if not a bit off center but that might be my fault.
---
You are a melee player, that means you have STR, so use the LMG, and it's a GOD roll
---
Are people still using workshops? Honest question.
---
Yes mods will be coming eventually to fallout 1st. They said that a few weeks ago when they announced it.
---
Instigating Gauss?
---
That bloodied lmg would be great, make it prime so you can make a lot more ammo and it'll be stronger
---
For perk cards
---
Str: heavy gunner(9 points), blocker(3 points) and third card is your choice. Personally I use bullet shield(3 points) when I run a bloodied heavy build.
---
Int: gunsmith(5 points), nerd rage(3 points) and stabilizer(3 points)
---
Lck: bloody mess(3 points), one gun army(3 points) and maybe serendipity (3 points)
---
I think that's a very good theory, because this did start happening in the same patch that fixed the goo piles.
---
I've noticed also that sometimes if you wait around long enough, the enemies teleport back to a spawn point, regain their armor, and start attacking as normal.  I know because I tried to take a picture with an idle Super Mutant and ended up getting shot a few seconds later after he teleported.  This is very similar to that Legendary enemy bug in Whitesprings, where you kill a Legendary and its corpse vanishes, only to find the loot pile back at its original spawn point.
---
Getting banned
---
If you are using Junkies you don't want the chem effect perks because while having the chem effects you'd lose your addiction temporarily.
---
Yup that's fair.
---
this. before i switched to a commando build i had all the rifleman perks + tankkiller, bloody mess etc and an instigating lever + semi-auto handmade. i would use the leveraction for supermutants and the handmade for weaker enemies like ghouls. they all die with one bodyshot. add in gun-fu and you can drop a whole bunch of ghouls in seconds
---
In PVP since damage is capped people'd use Junkies as well so they can have more health while enjoying massive damage buff.
---
In power armor have emergency protocol, calibrated shocks and targeting hud.
---
I've also noticed this with ash piles. I saw about 5 unkillable ghouls in WS and 2 of them were on ash piles, with more ash piles in the area. I also had this happen with a turret.
---
LMG is *the shit*, but getting ammo for it is ridiculous. 50cal is okay, and piss easyy to maintain ammo/condition wise.
---
Or maybe, just maybe, people are getting tired of these shit posts?
---
Has no context in this thread. Plenty around where it would at least meet that minimum requirement.
---
Not a 1st sub, but definitely over reading this garbage every 10 comments.
---
I don't know if you want them, but here's a few tips from someone who recently went from hiding every match to being more aggressive.
---
* Drop directly next to a large box location.  At least 1/2 the time you'll get one, and if not there's usually a small/medium in proximity.
---
* Invest in endurance perks and damage perks.  I use the increased health, increased dr/er, Nerd Rage, and Frog Legs to make sure I have a chance of getting out of most bad situations.  Damage perks are also pretty essential, whatever weapon you're most comfortable with you should have a damage perk for.  (for me it's personally melee/automatic rifles)
---
* You can place your CAMP anywhere, any time, at no cost.  This has come in handy more times than I can count, placing down a bunch of defenses, or a house, or a lookout tower has saved my butt a bunch of times.
---
* Work with your team.  Even if you're someone who normally goes solo, at least queue with a team, because if they're near you, they will have your back most of the time.  Think of them as companions.
---
* Don't fight unless you have to.  Unless you have someone dead to rights, avoid attacking them and their team, stay stealthy, you'll more than likely catch them off guard later.
---
Hope this helps!
---
What platform? I don’t personally play NW but I’ve read all over there is rampant cheating, aim bots and so forth. Believe it’s easier to hack on pc than on a console
---
Chem effects cancel the addictions?
---
Oh yeah, and Bethesda also banned those dataminers' accounts as thanks.
---
No Gauss. All my weapons have silencers.
---
 IE pipe rifle does the most damage. 
---
 I+10% while aiming lever action is second
---
 I+10% while aiming handmade third
---
 Followed by all my handmades. AAE, TSE, VE, ect.
---
It’s kinda selfish to take the entire map down, but Bethesda couldn’t care less you’re only hurting us
---
Yeah I kinda was of a mind that since I didn't luck out and get one of the +40% damage perks there's almost no point in my getting in a fight unless I absolutly had to, or myself and someone else both spawned on a box location, and I beat them to it.  like 9/10 even when I got the drop on someone I ended up dying because I could only take 2 shots while they could take 5 from me.  Or I had a crossbow because those can 1 shot people sometimes for some reason hah.    
---
I remember one time I came across a guy on the roof of the school, unarmored, with a laser rifle and I with a 50. cal and marine armor decided I had an advantage, hit him over 5 times, he hit me 3 and I was dead.  Head shots I guess, but I was like wtf, why bother.
---
Uses exploits, gets banned. Everything else is irrelevant. It's not rocket science.
---
Thanks.   I noticed that when I go into meds there are none available, even grayed out.
---
It works on all Power Armors to my knowledge.  All I can recommend is restarting your game, check the Atomic Shop again, then go in-game and attempt to change it under Change Appearance/Skin.  I do recall once hearing that some NW rewards weren't being given, hope that's not the case for you, best of luck.
---
I got my refund today and promptly uninstalled it and Bethesda launcher. It’s a shame, under all that detritus and greed there is fun to be had, until it crashes.
---
Thank you but that isn't this post :(
---
Yeah we kind of knew mods would be coming to fallout eventually months before release. Did they switch that to their monthly sub scheme now?
---
I'd love to see how they are going to handle content mods then. And fallout 1st seems like a crummy scheme to pull without them having that as an option since release. It made it seem like you were buying the full game at the start just to hit you with a sub fee months after.
---
Interesting im going to have to use this
---
I do, but only on private servers for farming materials. The defend events are icing.
---
You will need to become the general first the game will give you a tutorial for the turminal
---
Just think about it, an addiction is harmful not just because you are addicted, but also you'd experience withdrawal.
---
The negative effects of the additions in game are caused by withdrawals, so when you take drugs the addictions go away for the duration if the drug because you'll not experience withdrawal while taking drugs.
---
Ive only ever seen it on deathclaws but im not sure.
---
As far as I'm aware you'll need to get the cards again. They are unique to the server as the password changes based on server. Sucks. I did this myself right around the time people started reporting issues with it. Not sure if I just got lucky or if it's not an issue for PC. Not sure what system you are on.
---
If it was just two or three sure. But there’s a huge number of misses. Once you start hitting it usually did keep hitting but even at point blank range I’ve seen my bullet go off god knows where
---
I think they did.
---
That's false, gat gun is one of the worst heavies after fire rate fix. And 50cal ammo is crafted in abundance.
---
I do agree about trading them though. But for a better 50cal.
---
True, its not just the game but the entire ecosystem that helps the popularity of the game. From NSFW source engine overwatch to fan made map mods of Skyrim, the community helps the game grow in popularity. 
---
If Bethesda continues on its path, by the time Starfield/ES6 comes out, there won't be much left. And if both games are even similar to F4, their rep will be forever gone.
---
Then all you did was pay for admission like the rest of us. You haven’t paid any extra to go on any of those Atom Shop or Fallout 1st rides so they have kicked you out of the park.
---
I think it's incorrect on robots as well
---
I was previously a bush hider but this new map basically begs you to use aquaboy and hang out in there. I got that card when I was about 3k from the goal but used it each match after I got it. The river has decent temporary hiding spots but it is too clear so someone will definitely shoot or grenade you out eventually, but that big pond above the dam is great if the fire closes in on that area.
---
It’s not just Whitespring. It just happened yesterday in Ash Heap to me.
---
This happened to me too, I filmed it using Xbox capture, went to take a photo with one and he shifted and regained his armour/brain.
---
I have a Bloodied build currently. I am probably going to switch to Junkie’s because I find myself using AAFFR or AAE guns. No point in having super low health if my guns don’t need it to be powerful.
---
I think the other prefixes that are less frequently used need a buff. Especially Berserker’s because you’re giving up tons on DR for very little DPS.
---
Rad damage for non-PA characters is notorius if RR is zero. 
---
Optimal use of the backpack is not to wear it, until is totally needed, then try to go to base to unload crap asap, and repeat.
---
To fast-key Radshield/GBP/Rad-X can help too.
---
Made it a few times but it doesn't work most of the times
---
They aren’t switching to anything. Like I showed you... they said private servers/mods would always be a service through them.
---
Had this happen at West-Tek, but there was like 2 of him?  One was the naked unkillable part, and he just teleported between two guard posts with no animation, but then there was an invisible enemy attacking me as well, which I assume was his severed soul or some sh\*t lmao
---
Thank goodness they got rid of that. The cutout was actually blocking the posters (ones to start the nukashine, sheepsquatch, pioneer scouts stuff.) at like 50% of the train stations they where at.
---
I got the Power Armour Edition, yet to install the game because like many I don't have time to waste on a garbage game. Also, how many months it took them to send a canvas bag. Seeing as how bad the latest Wolfenstein game went, Bethseda aren't getting any purchases from me in the future.
---
It appears Bethesda is making their West Virginia very similar to the real West Virginia, and for that I'm very sorry.
---
It's almost like they're trying to profit from their product
---
Not in my opinion. But to each their own
---
Thanks for this, another confirmation of what I've got on [Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup | Patch 14.0 | 10/23/2019 - The "Bombs" Dropped &amp; Private Servers](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm9q59/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch/).   
---
I'll cite you as another source
---
No, they have like a fireman type combat helmet as well as the wetsuit mask type thing.
---
Both look awesome imo but the tactical matches the wetsuit, whereas the combat matches the actual armour.
---
I'm only giving my opinion based my experience. You're right about the .50cal ammo, all I was saying was that you're not going to find much on bodies.
---
lol
---
I don't like playing nuclear winter because I just plain fucking suck.
---
I’ll take
---
I’d really appreciate that bro
---
The plans for Prime receivers drop from the SBQ
---
Yes as they should! The bad thing is the part where they toss out surprise subscription fees where they hadn't had any need before. Their atom shop is, well I don't want to beat a dead horse there. 
---
I don't think they ever said mods would be a service through them. Having servers hosted would be. And we aren't confusing instanced worlds with privately hosted servers now are we?
---
Ok.  Just left the game, but will be back on a bit later.  You can have it.
---
I dont think so. I just did another search but cant find anything like a real remake with graphics like todays games
---
I on xbox?
---
Are you*
---
Ok I just learned this.  Thanks.
---
Its almost like theyre gouging my eyes out with a rusty spoon *Almost*
---
PS4 sorry
---
Oh wait you aren’t ...
---
Shit
---
Went and ruined Providence Equity's perfect 5 star review on Google.
---
20 hours from when you last made your first sale to them. So if you sell to a vendor at 4pm, it'll reset at noon for you the next day.
---
Alright, well thanks anyway I appreciate that. Need more people like you in the community
---
No problem have a good day
---
I filmed another one the other day as it was like a horror movie, everytime he was out of sight he would teleport to a different spot, SPoOkY stuff.
---
It wasn’t his job to test the exploit he found on another forum.  If you are told your neighbor is selling drugs you don’t go and try to buy the drugs first to confirm it before calling the police. 
---
I have no sympathy for someone in the regard.
---
Right?  Shouldn't they just have to pay **hundreds of thousands of dollars a month\*** to keep the servers running, because I paid them $40 once a year and a half ago?  They are TOTALLY SCREWING ME.
---
Frankly, I'm getting really sick of the entitled BS people keep posting.
---
\*\* I'm familiar with the costs of infrastructure on AWS, and I estimate they spend between $80k to $200k a month, depending on what is being used.
---
Plenty more to low HP build than just the gun. Handful of perks &amp; adrenal reaction also benefit from it.
---
But I agree, having this few strong builds is kinda silly.
---
its actually nothing like gouging someones eyes out with a spoon as far as I can tell..
---
Cheers man, your bug round ups are incredible, Bethesda should be paying you.
---
Do you need karma?
---
But here's the thing. Zenimax owns a lot more than just Bethesda and the other developers doesn't seem to be hurt as much when they are doing major releases. DOOM ETERNAL seems to be looking great, for example. So, we aren't too sure how Zenimax is playing their cards.
---
Chem works
---
If you're feeling powerful then the game  may be unbalanced towards you: it's an environment that allows you to explore different playstyles, and to see which you feel work best. I play a support build using a TS +bash submachine gun with a Scorched Killer's receiver as my main weapon (doing about 30 damage per shot), and aside from ammo consumption I'm not worried about about solo'ing Whitesprings or a Sheepsquatch fight
---
Awesome!  Only one I have left too
---
It is completely normal, what that game company did for you is considered abnormal. 
---
Besides, we’re just going to take this guys word for it that everything was on the level just because he creates a tool for everyone to use?
---
There are plenty of people in the real world who do “nice things for others“ and then turn out to be some of the shadiest people alive, just trying to hide in plain sight
---
Sounds like you’ve been spending some quality time with diseased mirelurk spawn. Congrats! :)
---
Step 1: Go to the Highland Marsh
---
Step 2: Kill the mirelurk queen and any other mirelurks that spawn, minus the hatchlings
---
Step 3: Hope you get a diseased hatchling
---
Step 4: Get a diseased hatchling and wait to get bitten a million times
---
Step 5: ???
---
Step 6: Profit
---
Thank you friend! I am so happy. 1100 hours later and it finally happened ✊🏻
---
Im glad you won.
---
&gt;, so long as you follow some guidelines
---
There are many companies that DON’T offer benefits like this, and usually with stipulations.
---
Did Bethesda offer such a deal? If not, then what entitles someone to think they should be allowed to do so for the company?
---
You can’t just say “other companies do it so Bethesda should as well”.  
---
Further, is the only reason there is any outrage is because this person creates a tool everyone uses? Does that mean they are automatically innocent? Had this been some rando would you really have been defending them as much as you are now?
---
Or a hug?
---
I remember 2 games I had where I went against an enemy who had power armour and I can't kill them then another game I found power armour and an enemy shredded me in like 2 seconds
---
Hes making fun of the fools on here that trash 1st.
---
Thank God I'm not alone. I always thought I was trash getting killed by those when I see people running and running into whitesprings. I always wondered what possible set up they have not to die after two hits from a charred feral ghoul. I hate those things with a passion.
---
Try heavy weapons, I'm a full health NON junky, no power armour build with only 6 of the 9 points of extra heavy weapon dmg and can shred anything in the game
---
Light Machine Gun or a 50cal are fun as and mow through enemies.
---
&gt;~~I’m hoping~~ **Bethesda blows** ~~us away with something real cool, but sadly I’m prepared to be disappointed....this has been 3 weeks of shitty inside the vaults - heck, one week they didn’t even do one :(~~
---
Fixed......
---
It's been bugged for several patches, and currently unobtainable to my knowledge.
---
If you're on XB, I'll unlock it fir you if you're looking for the quantum paint
---
Awesome.
---
Imho, depending on ammo sustain through looting is not a way to live. Especially for auto user. Both 5mm and 50cal are cheap to make and buy, so it shouldn't be a problem.
---
The issue with gat gun is that while it packs a mean punch, accuracy and fire rate are crap. 50cal's accuracy is also crap, but it's easy to correct fire due to RPM. With gat gun (after fix), if you miss - well, better luck next Thursday.
---
**-1 Luck**
---
You said that you were distracted by your dogs, you performed an action without fully planning the outcome, and you're upset at a company known for running an unfinished product. If you're doing something that may cost your character an an item or an amount of caps that will cause you distress if it's lost it's your responsibility to ensure that you're paying attention an showing as much diligence as you think is needed for the task at hand
---
Ok boomer
---
Has anyone told you about the Burrows ghouls doing the same? When i kill them some of them instantly teleport to their sleeping spot (i haven't tested killing them close since i use a explosive gun) and appear as headless + standing position or with its full model in sleep position (even if tore into pieces with bloody mess) but have no collision therefore you can't loot them. Sometimes when i come back after a while or i walked far enough from them they create the meat pile and you can loot them. It's not the same but its sure a bug, since all ghouls from down there create the meat piles quicker, most likely to avoid performance issues
---
You also can't identify generations :-P
---
Such a boomer thing to say ;)
---
Chem works?
---
No context? I literally replied to someone who made a joke about 1st and got downvoted.
---
I’m a 1st subscriber and I will never get tired of people protesting to get me a better deal.
---
Bethesda clearly respond to public outcry look at the recent skin for 500 which got made free due to public protest.
---
I just hope everyone keeps up the pressure then everyone can enjoy the improvements.
---
The Mission:  Save Santa's Brain
---
something about robobrains, erm... it's Ho Ho Ho Horrific!
---
Burrows ghouls are munted, almost every single time I do a run through there, sometimes when a ghoul dies it goes to it's spawn and starts "walking" in a random direction, straight through solid walls. Whack.
---
Two shot is now a mere 25% dmg increase, and increased weapon degradation. Anti armor, junkies, bloodied are the meta now, depends lots on where are you focusing. For melee bloodied 2 hand weapons or unarmed with full unyielding set and low health
---
When as of today the framerates haven't gotten
---
Better, I realized that this is it.  This is the game.   It is what it is.
---
I just want my combat armor helmet to have armor again
---
Is that too much to ask? D:
---
Again not a surprise...
---
The core game still does not have a subscription. The subscription is for a new service.
---
Oh.
---
That's on him.
---
He doesn't have to datamine the game, find bugs, exploit them, record it then send to bethesda.
---
Simply finding them and reporting is all that is required.
---
Don't have loot to spare, but will add you later today and help you out, i got a toon im gearing up hes around 35 so we can both benefit from the help.
---
You stuck at the Wendigo cave? That's tough at your level. Anyways, I'm lvl 118 and could give you a couple of things, although I don't have any legendaries your level. If you're on tomorrow morning EST (~6-10am), look me up. IGN raskol.
---
My girlfriend and I keep finding headless idle ghouls around whitesprings so we say to each over so no head?
---
the robote were already planned since before launch, watch the C.a.m.p. trailer from back then which shows the complete station with the collectron
---
Attention never paid me though
---
I heard you have to log on constantly to keep pets around
---
I have only played the mode 2 times. Lost 1 and won once. But my win was cause I was carried by crazy good players. My issue is i have a sniper build and i hit a clear head stot and i do little to no damage. I do more damage in adventure mode to players the in NW. Makes no sense to me.
---
Thanks for the insght.  build is mainly focused on crits, guess will go for AA or maybe junkies.. Bloodied is high risk which my toon doesnt have the health to do
---
Your forgetting the fact that they launched it broken. If they cared they wouldnt be milking people who actually stuck around. Everyone should quit fallout 76 and leave it as a lesson to players and developers at what happens when you launch half baked garbage and then ignore community feed back... *cough Anthem*
---
And also there r actually clowns who would willing to buy it
---
Agreed. When you can't unshit a game for a year and attract players, instead of losing then - you have to find other ways of sustain. Like milking the few that not left yet, for example.
---
Yes, that works. Bethesda sold 1st folks unframed territory, and I am glad they delivered
---
About tree fiddy
---
One thing I haven't seen mentioned, is Bethesda, like any other company, has people who don't like being made to look foolish or incompetent. This used to be the adored Bethesda, but now with all these 76 issues, they are SCRAMBLING to mitigate the damage. So is it possible when they became aware of the exploits that they themselves left in the game they started a program of blaming server instability on the exploits? With these constant problems that HAS to be a huge hit to someone's pride. Ergo they are not going to call any more attention to the problems than absolutely necessary. So maybe it's easier to just throw all these "helpers" under the bus.
---
Why a new character?
---
Im pretty sure i already did that? Ive been doing the enclave stuff in order to do nukes i made my x01. All im missing is the science wing. Is there a 2end quest line to unlock it?
---
This is the result of not allowing for PvP outside of mutual engagements and workshops. There really needs to be more...
---
I used to until I realized combat wasn’t my forté and the best strategy was to play NW like a glorified game of hide and seek. Now I regularly make it to the final four because I’ve become so good at hiding, I even came in 1st place completely solo recently without killing a single player.
---
You probably picked up a dupers cache and set off some flags
---
Its poor game design.
---
Those were the original vending machines. They were moved to scrap collectors instead.
---
Well... they also give you 19,800 atoms for that price... so there’s that.
---
Cause its fun. Don't like it don't do it
---
I deadass won a game solo two days ago doing this. It was HILARIOUS sitting at the bottom of the lake and watching everybody else die of radiation.
---
Well hasn’t it only technically been like, a day? If wastelanders takes place a year later
---
I prefer instigating
---
Same here on PS4, I dunno what happened but I wasn't able to do Encrypted or launch a nuke without the server having significant lag spikes and slow responding time.
---
Can we opt for Monopoly dollars instead? At those I can wipe my ass with, when times are dire.
---
The most anyoing is non legendary stuff and semi-rare outfits.
---
The best is junk, ammo, deacent 3* legendarys and food.
---
The ego in these “change my mind posts”, insane
---
Well I was mostly referring to the comment above yours. 
---
Doesn't change that there is still no context to Dupers or Scammers, in either comment, however.
---
Mostly just pointing out that downvotes aren't all going to be from 'shills.' I don't doubt there are BGS accounts around, but that doesn't inherently make every single downvote a 'shill vote.' Was providing a potential reason as to why they're receiving them.
---
I honestly thought it was just me but I think you’re right, when I was running Mischief Night I could swear they were hitting like trucks
---
Stuff I look for is anything with two or more rolls that have good synergy, like a couple vats rolls on a rifle, or something with a good first effect and faster fire rate, etc. Anything that’s just bloodied or junkies can be sold for 2-3k. Swing speed melee can be sold too. Armour with weight reduction, sentinel/cavalier, unyielding etc.
---
Ammo at a cap a piece, 40mm grenades for between 1-5 caps, cheap missiles, flux, some chems, always lookin for interesting weapons and armour
---
I don't think I am. OP has responded to people asking if they should vote if they have uninstalled the game, and OP asked them not to.
---
I don't disagree with you that your opinion matters, I'm just telling you that OP was trying to measure how many people from the currently active, installed player base were Fallout 1st subscribers. So, you voting would indeed skew OP's results.
---
But honestly, if you ever read the comment that I linked to, having people who aren't actively playing skew the results was just one of many far more serious problems with the methodology OP was using to collect the data, which OP ended up not being able to access anyway. So, really, it's a pretty moot point all around.
---
I don't think you or anyone else voting in the poll matters much at all, because the poll was never going to give us useful data anyway. That's the point I was making.
---
Sure, but bloodied usually means unyielding, and that buffs the fuck out of everything to trigger life saving perks, reductions, etc.
---
That sounds sad! In 2016 I had a SATA cable with a metal connector short my HD7970 3 GB. I played on intergrated graphics for months 
---
I would suggest a **used power supply ASAP,** but not a used graphics card. Buy the card new when you can. At the bottom the RX580 8gb is good, then the GTX 2060 Super, finally the RX5700 is a fast option 
---
Look up any used power supply on LTT's Power Supply Tier List: https://linustechtips.com/main/topic/1045610-new-psu-tier-list/
---
I use that a lot, and it's very helpful. However, it doesn't account for the huge drop in accuracy on the handmade, even when aiming. It's really noticeable on that weapon in particular.
---
Well so far we have seen games released that were already in development before the 2015 shift, so there has been less time to shift to new sales tactics. That said you still have games like the new Wolfenstien which are designed around MTX and multiplayer. I would expect them going forward to start having more monetization put into them, though I expect the focus is going to remain on the flagship games, TES and Fallout. Don't get me wrong I hope you are correct, TES is one of my favorite series, but I think it is naive to expect it to get better.
---
Just use the red and white lamps and you get the light atleast lol
---
"The rules are be cool to eachother"
---
F
---
&gt;There are many companies that DON’T offer benefits like this, and usually with stipulations.
---
And? The statement you made, while insulting someone here, was that no one did it and then asked for just one game that did. I linked numerous games that quite obviously do.
---
&gt;Did Bethesda offer such a deal? If not, then what entitles someone to think they should be allowed to do so for the company?
---
[Right here in their support forum.](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/319566/fallout-76-known-issues-and-feedback?language%5B%5D=en)
---
Where it says, and I quote:
---
&gt;[All Platforms] Duplication Exploits and Issues
---
&gt; STATUS: We take exploits very seriously. If you think you are experiencing an exploit, stop using it immediately and let our Support team know in a ticket.
---
That straight forward enough for you? Find it, report it, don't abuse it. This is what you say they don't do, right there in black and white.
---
&gt;You can’t just say “other companies do it so Bethesda should as well”. 
---
Most companies do this, and for good reason. You want as many people trying to find bugs as possible because that means you have a better chance of locating and crushing them faster. This has been SOP for games for a very long damn time now, just check all the bug reporting forums for HUNDREDS of games. But fortunately I don't have to say Bethesda should do this since they already do, per the above link.
---
&gt;Further, is the only reason there is any outrage is because this person creates a tool everyone uses? Does that mean they are automatically innocent? Had this been some rando would you really have been defending them as much as you are now?
---
My dude, that person *IS* a rando for me. I don't know him. I don't know his work. I'm not saying he's innocent or guilty as we have no hard data on how long he used the exploit or when he told Bethesda about it. If he indeed found an exploit and used it for days/weeks or they did find him using it before he reported it, then the ban is justifiable. However, if he reported it promptly, most importantly before they found him using it, then they shouldn't have banned him, per their own support forum statement. 
---
But again, I have no dog in that hunt. My thing in this thread is you giving someone shit here for the VERY wrong statement that game devs don't accept bug/exploit reports from players.  And suddenly your last post here has drifted away from that stance for some odd reason.
---
When there is weapons, armor and junk im coming to the store. When i find out it's non legendary/overpriced weapons, non rare outfits i get sad and lay down in a corner to start crying
---
Mispriced items i can sell myself
---
Fallout first reeeeee
---
soureststraws
---
yeah... people are just getting ridiculous with this Bethesda bashing trend... they were cheating and got banned... don’t cheat and you won’t get banned, so fking simple.
---
It sounds like you need fallout 1st.
---
“ how dare you ban us for cheating” - logic lol
---
He echoes my feelings very well.
---
Good idea
---
I mean, it's a business man. I love games too, but I completely understand that the people who are making them have to make money if I want to get more content from them.
---
Honestly, I think it was stupid of them to ever say that everything would be free after you buy the game. Bethesda needs some way to make money after launch if they're going to continue supporting it. I'm not a cheapskate, I don't mind paying a monthly fee or paying for DLC's, or whatever makes sense so that the project can be a success for me and the studio/developers.
---
I think where everyone (players, studios, and devs) is getting fucked is studios trying to cater to dipshits who think they should be able to pay $60 for a game and then get years worth of additional free content out of it in addition to the base game, and that this is somehow a reasonable expectation. 
---
That's how we end up with:
---
* Bullshit monetization schemes (lootboxes, expensive utility items, etc)
---
* Buggy releases
---
* Studios that don't care about our opinions
---
If people would just be willing to pay what the fucking games actually cost to make, studios would quit trying to get so creative about additional revenue streams to break even or make a profit, and it would be a better experience for everyone.
---
Bethesda:"We have our best developers working day and night on bug fixes for the next patch"
---
Also Bethesda: "Are you really trying to do our job???? Leave it to the experts!!!!!! We have a new update coming in the 3rd qtr of 2020!!! (Mole miner heavy breathing)
---
Broadsider is broken, has been since launch. So because Bethesda is either incompetent or doesn't give a fuck (probably both?) the weapon is worthless.
---
A bloodied stealth/crit build will have the best damage, and I wearing unyielding armor the increased perception, agility and luck are great for the build. If you're doing stealth right, low health shouldn't be much of an issue, but run Serendipity and get sentinel as the 3rd perk on your armor and you'll have a much easier time.
---
It sucks early on, but once you hit lvl 30, and can start actually making a build, it gets better. 
---
Focus on dmg perks, pharma farma is great early on, med-x for the 50DR, psycho for dmg boosts.
---
Pick 1 class of weapons, and focus on it. Demolition expert is a good one to run as a secondary dmg boost.
---
Scrip legendaries, 5.56 ammo, uncommon to rare junk.
---
Doubt that I'm in their face and no contact damage, but I think you were being ironic 👍
---
Hehehe
---
Ammo(5.56/10mm), cheap guns, maybe some armor.
---
Also bulk junk that’s cheap.
---
&gt; -how did I overfill my stash box and why am I over-encumbered after my first time logging back in after months?
---
When I logged in for the last time, 2 months ago, I was also over-encumbered without knowing why. It turns out, the game had stripped all my power armor of its armor pieces and was now just individually in my inventory weighing me down. The same thing had happened in my stash box.
---
LMG for life. And prime it. I use that same LMG because you can use heavy or shotguns under strength if you have 15 points and use a fist weapon, you'll have 6 points left for heavy guns.

nah one shot is all you can handle

No outfits or overpriced scripworthy legendaries. One can dream right.

It's got some royal jelly in the bathtub of you need some.
---
That’s not been your wife’s experience ;)
---
hasn't been your dad's experience either but I still respect the guy
---
Yeah weak spots and damage colors are not tied. Usually yellow number appear on headshots. Sometime, on vertibot for exemple, yellow damage is on the tail, but it's where you do the less damage. On cargobot, weakspots (crippling and damage) are on the thrusters but yellow damage are on the fly unit or whatever it is called.
---
On mirelurk queen or sheepsquatch, yellow is tied to the head, but weakspots are their legs &lt;_&gt; maybe yellow number is tied to the damage multiplier, but it can be also the part with the more armor leading the ennemy to take the double of reduced damage, and the weak spot has less armor but takes normal full damage.
---
I really don't know of damage localization works and if armor is also localized, but it could be an explanation.
---
as I've told another user, I can agree in theory, but in practice, if it wasn't for these people, your passwords would still be transferred in plain text format.
---
this is an extraordinary case because Bethesda seems to hire incompetent ****s exclusively and it's up to the community to fix their messes. so nothing new, really.
---
Ah, you’ve been to his club?
---
That was actually a very good joke made by vending machine owner. I wonder if anybody buys that crap and finds out he's been scammed, ha.

Lmao, poor mole miner must have been travelling at some speed when they hit that door...

It's the same button you hold and release to throw a grenade or bash.
---
lol will do buddy.  good luck out there n sry about loosing caps that sucks
---
Gotchas.    Thanks much!!!!
---
Yup. Same here. A Super Mutant one appears pretty reliably for me in the Grafton Steel Mill. He’s in a building right next to the road, really dark inside, with a conveyor belt. He’s sitting on a crate, and has his head stuck in the wall. 
---
I shoot him, and blood flies, but he never moves or dies. Eventually he just disappears.
---
They're already doing that when you look at it, Wastelanders was supposed to 'save' the game from the community's perspective, they knew they couldn't and wouldn't develope it that way so now they moved release into a time when other popular games (and consoles) release in hope of having lesser attention than now while also trying to milk the last bit of cash of its remaining players and scaring the others away
---
Thx man, shit happens, I’ll earn them back quick anyway.
---
Jesus.  It was a joke.   I have fallout 1st myself.
---
[deleted]
---
Wow man, money is evil!! You can’t be talking like that here!!
---
 bruh.   Can you post your build?
---
Primed LMG are the way to go for endgame imo. Until then like you said 50cal.
---
Any idea on when a first playable version might be released?
---
It’s like all of the people who sat in math class and business and said, “I’ll never use this in my life,” grew up and now they’re playing Fallout.
---
gears and screws pls
---
By now I doubt Wastelanders will meet any expectations looking at how they haven't given out a new roadmap since the last one ended two months ago and they had the nerve to delay their biggest update yet for a paid subscription nobody asked for
---
Cheap, cheap everything cause you can get pretty much anything in game if you play, so no point paying absurd prices for anything.
---
fo1st subscription required

Traps lots of traps, vending machines are mostly full of garbage so camps with ingenious traps make the visit for huge lists of plans and clothing worthwhile.

How Minigun with triple barrel (better damage, lower rate of fire) compare to gatling gun?
---
A roll of toilet paper and 1 spoiled meat.
---
Get a good team, increase your sensitivity, use frog legs, practice jump shooting and head shots, don’t use vats in adventure
---
I can't give ammo away now, granted can't go less than 1to1caps in game but I'm guessing people are just building huge quantities now infinite scrap is a thing on 1st.
---
&gt; First off, Bethesda isn't that credible to begin with. 
---
I'm not saying they are. I'm saying that their actions only make sense if it is true that people are buying things like utility items and Fallout 1st at a higher rate than cosmetics. If it wasn't selling, why would you keep making more of it? All you would accomplish is to make no money and piss everyone off. It's not like businesses make decisions out of spite. They're doing it because it is what is working for them. That's how all businesses behave. Typically, when you see a business doing something shitty, they're doing that shitty thing because it's profitable, or because it saves them money.
---
&gt; Even ignoring that they have a clear financial interest to lie about the facts 
---
I don't see how. Nobody is paying them to tell us what is and isn't selling. If utility items weren't selling, Bethesda could lie all damn day to say they were and crank out more of them. It wouldn't make them any money to do that though, because the way Bethesda makes money in that situation is if lots of people buy those utility items.
---
Bethesda doesn't get paid per lie they tell, they get paid per Atomic Shop item they sell.
---
&gt; Secondly, Bethesda never showed any better evidence that the majority of the community wanted more p2w microtransactions than reddit has. Their only evidence(as far as we know) for backing up that the community wanted it wasn't any polls or responses from the playerbase, it was just the sales of microtransactions. Even if you were to ignore that the usual percentage of players in live service games that buy microtransactions is around or below 5%, this still is by far a worse way to judge how the actual whole Fallout 76 community feel about the game than using reddit. 
---
Again, I'm not going off what Bethesda has said. I'm looking at their actions. 
---
And regardless of what percentage of the player base buys Atomic Shop items, cosmetic or otherwise, that's the percentage that Bethesda is going to be considering when making their decisions. Because, again, Bethesda isn't some lame boogeyman, they're a business. If you stop being so emotionally invested in their decisions and just think of them as just another business, it's very easy to analyze their actions and make various reasonable conclusions.
---
I've almost never come across a camp in game that didn't have Atomic Shop items though, so I also think your 5% number is probably wrong, at least in the case of Fallout 76. 
---
I did some quick research and found [this study from The NDP Group](https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/2016/latest-report-from-the-npd-group-provides-insight-into-gamers-purchasing-usage-and-perceptions-of-additional-gaming-content/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=Oktopost-twitter-profile&amp;utm_campaign=Oktopost-Press+Releases) (a market research firm) that found that 78% of players are willing to purchase micro-transactions. 28% of players had made a micro-transaction purchase within the last 3 months.  
---
That's pretty far from 5%. You got a reliable source for that number?
---
&gt;Thirdly, you seem to be under the impression that because something is profitable, it must mean that is also popular with the majority of the community, This is flat out false. There are many things in the games industry that are both very unpopular and hated and yet make a ton of cash. 
---
No, you just misunderstood me. This is why I said: "Bethesda's consistent actions suggest that they have very good data to suggest that we are also not representative of the larger player base, that listening to us would cost them money and **potentially** even make the majority of the players unhappy..."
---
Your point here is why that word "**potentially**" is there in my sentence. Because I recognize that just because it's profitable doesn't mean that the majority loves it. I don't know how popular utility items actually are in Fallout 76. That's why I erred on the side of caution and suggested that listening to us **could potentially** make the majority upset. Because the majority may disagree with us, or they may not. 
---
But looking at Bethesda's actions, they definitely behave as if they have data to suggest that utility items are popular enough to be consistently profitable.
---
.45 and 5.56 ammo.
---
 Decent legendary pipe guns for use and collection.
---
 Mispriced legendary weapons.
---
Ok thanks
---
Feel free to tell all the users you want.. and you can jump on the Bethesda hate train for all I care. Cheating is cheating, and it results in banishment's. Just because you don't agree with who BGS hires does not give you the right to cheat. But let me guess, it's all Big Bad Bethesda's fault. If they don't ban cheaters the haters will have a problem. When they do ban cheat engine users, well gosh the other haters have a problem.
---
yeah but here comes the thing: In comparison to the mindless sheep they want for its money he was the type who would analyze their game and report stuff expecting them to fix them which probably was their biggest problem with him.
---
They only want some brainless derps connecting their wallets to the game while playing every shitpile they throw at them without complains not somebody being actually 'helpful'
---
That's weapon is only good for the scrip.
---
so....When's Half-Life 3?
---
Accidentally read armourless as amorous and was slightly concerned.
---
All valid points.
---
Lol nice that gave me a good laugh
---
..and an I.O.U. Toilet Paper note.
---
I also have taken a liking to vampire. I run a lower health build but not as low as bloodied. I stay around 50% health to get a 25% damage bonus from adrenal reaction. Vampire helps a lot since I have less room for error when taking damage. I use a shotgun and the healing effect is multiplied for each pellet so I rarely have to worry about dying.
---
so people use cheating software and get banned? what a surprise
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
Thanks for the laugh
---
u beat me to it!
---
Here I thought gaming companies were all starving artists living out of VW buses because the thrill of creativity was enough to sustain them.
---
45 / 5.56 @ 1c a piece
---
Plans/recipes I don't know
---
I used the same build until I found it is useless against SBQ, Legendary Sheepsquatch and pretty much every enemy with bigger health bar.
---
It’s very hit and miss, but 10mm, 38, and other common types almost never sell.  My experience with 5.56 is it will be bought all at once, no matter if it’s 50 bullets or 5,000 bullets.
---
Infinite scrap has definitely made an impact though, it’s almost impossible to sell certain types, even bulked.  Not sure if I’ll keep the 1st subscription but I made several runs on pretty much every junk item on private servers just to beef up the amounts in my scrapbox.
---
They add CHARACTER and that classic BETHESDA CHARM!
---
Yep, just make sure you don't have any grenades selected!
---
Lost a ton of scrap to the bug. Opened a ticket and was told they would grant me a variety of scrap items in the hope it would make things right. They said they'd email me when this was done and I am yet to receive that.
---
 Well an NV game is essential and you should try Overload which is Descent brought into the 21st century. I could almost make people puke with Descent. ;)
---
These 'semantics' are very important. Private worlds are not private servers. I was reading that your instanced world cannot be accessed while you are offline. Thus it isn't being hosted while not present. Private servers aren't this fallout 1, not at all.
---
Is this incorrect? Is it I who is confused as to what Fallout 1st gives it. Or is it you who is confused as to what a private server is?
---
I think you need to play it a little bit more.
---
Some tips: find a play style. There’s explosives, shotguns, ARs, heavy guns, melee, some people even use pistols. Your perks matter.
---
Another tip: You need to play with friends. You need to communicate (even use emotes). Don’t go off on your own.
---
I sucked at first, but now my highest kill game is 15 and I’m level 100 after just 2 months. You just need somebody who’s got experience to teach you how to play it, tbh.
---
What platform are you playing on?
---
I use AWS at my job, and it's not cheap. Sadly, these are whiny little brats who come on reddit to whine, moan, cry, about how things are so expensive. Oh well, clearly people are so UPSET that they have to establish a post to feel good about themselves.
---
He’s super strong AND super naked
---
All about the perks, even with vanilla weapons you can do well, for rifleman have a scoped weapon ND a non scoped for ranged and closer, covert operative sneak and escape artist and all the rifleman/ commando perks, use consumables too as well as weapon and armor mods to your advantage
---
problem is that they weren't cheating.
---
Yeah, but it has -2 PER.
---
To fix bugs they would need developers tasked with fixing bugs but as we've seen they don't give a damn about bugs but rather let the few remaining devs try their best to milk every last cent of the community before shutting down the servers next year
---
Adhesive. Always adhesive. 
---
And lever gun plans. All of them. :-)
---
Can you leave me your stuff in your will if you leave?
---
I just like wearing the spacesuit and helmet in toxic air environments
---
Nope I have people I owe that to. :)
---
The prime recievers are a drop from SBQ and  sometimes from scorchbeasts. You might be able to trade for it, but if you kill the queen enough times you'll def get it. You might already have it if you've killed the queen before.
---
There's just nothing to do. Everyone who has reached endgame is doing the same stuff: build, hoard (for some reason), Whitespring runs, and checking other player's camps. 
---
I bet most players don't stay much more than half an hour playing.
---
The game is fun? To each their own but my God I haven't played a game as boring as 76 prob ever.
---
Are you on PC or console?
---
It's an EA move done in a bethesda game, but in a bethesda way.  EA and Activision has taught companies that you don't need millions of people to buy your game to make money... just a limited amount of idiots with no concept of money value.
---
So, bethesda made a shop very carefully, QA'd it, then rushed a game around it with no QA-ing that side of things.  Attach the name fallout to it, give it a fallout feel, and make a burst of money from initial sales of the game, then throw all the microtransactions at the playerbase.  The sheer frustration of an unplayable game combined with a company pushing microtransactions, this should weed out the players who have self respect.
---
This remaining crowd are the people who don't realize the $60 cost at launch is just a glorified store that they put in their home.  So since they still remain and it's too many to legit take down the servers and make the apology yet (still making money)..  
---
Lets add a subscription store!  Now in order to buy all the things you may want, some will be locked behind a subscription-based store.  We'll make sure to announce the delay of wastelanders before launching the service.  This will tell us who OUR Fifa and NBA 2K crowd is for milking.  We are 1-uping EA, 2k, and activision.  Release a game yearly and make some changes?  screw that, just inform the playerbase that their are updates to come.  in the end, $100 a year is more then the 2k crowd is spending for their next in-home shop, and we don't have to worry about silly things like re-imagining/improving the UI, gameplay systems/mechanics, enemy types, etc.
---
Blizzard just announced in a stream that diablo 4 will have both microtransactions and paid dlc.  I personally would rather them say the base version is $200 with no further monetization.  But then again, that would limit the spending of the whales to $200, and that's just not enough.  All well, i'm just not going to buy it.  I'm just going to search for my next Celeste/Stardew Valley.  It's crazy to think today that indie devs can provide way more worth for my buck then AAA studios, while the quality of the fun is way better because theirs just no frustration factors while i play.
---
no cheaters on consoles.
---
Pc
---
I dunno man. I’ve used the double unyielding exploit to get 65 str but without it I haven’t seen anyone get as high as 57.
---
Stimpaks, but people are as lazy as I am and don't farm tick blood...
---
no you right my braid read 45 for some reason
---
I wish I could upvote your post twice, nay, three, nay, multiple times.

It hit rock bottom Months ago and only Stan's think otherwise
---
5.56 (no more than 1 cap each)
---
Plans that I don't know yet (I'm Level 250, so I know almost all of them).
---
Cheap flux or serums.
---
I do my daily and weekly challenges so I can get free atomic points. I do the dailies, especially the ones that give me possum badges.  I've played since Beta as well, and still have a lot of fun playing.  Honestly,  what keep me on are my friends.  I've met so many people in the community that I enjoy taking with and running events with that I dont get bored.  
---
If you like the game, but just bored, put it aside for awhile. Go play The Outer Worlds. It's really fun. As for the crashing, what system are you on? I'm on xbox and dont crash nearly as often as I used to.
---
The flaw is the fact if you have 29k caps and someone buys a 10k item from your vendor, the sale is allowed and 9k In caps will be vaporized.
---
Logical design would be a block, something along the lines of “this sale is not allowed at this time, it would exceed the limit of caps the seller is allowed”. 
---
Allowing the sale and burning the sellers caps is s flaw,.
---
MB
---
Np. That said you can do this kind of damage without the glitch even without a meathook. Pretty wild.
---
You are just blinded by hatred, aren't you? Everything Bethesda did was perfectly reasonable. When they found out about this exploit, they did a mass ban of every account that used the exploit. Perfectly reasonable move. They refuse his refund because he spent the consumable part of his subscription. They cannot get that back. Allowing a refund creates an infinite loophole. Grab Fallout 1st, spent the atoms, get a refund, repeat for infinite atoms. Try going into a McDonalds after you eat your burger asking for a refund. You won't get it. Perfectly reasonable.
---
Website owner did not close his website because he was operating it at a loss. He runs ads, he makes money. Nowhere in his reasons for closing the website does he state it's due to financial strain. He even says, "$14 bucks is nothing to me."
---
Website owner just wants to hold his website hostage for selfish reasons. Give me my account and refund back or else I will weaponize community outrage and make you look back. That is all this is. Nothing is stopping him from keeping the website open. He closes it and blames Bethesda for the closure. "Don't be mad that I closed the website," he says to the FO76 community, "it is Bethesda's fault for wronging me!" He is weaponizing you, Primordial_Owl, to get a refund and reverse ban. And you are ok with that.
---
r/cringe
---
Look! Pathetic Stans everywhere!
---
criticizing moderation rarely ends well..
---
The perks are worded poorly. The perk cards refer to the base weapon, so an explosive heavy gun is a missile launcher or a fat man. A Gatling gun is considered a ballistic, non explosive weapon. However, if you have an explosive Gatling gun (the legendary affix explosive on a normally ballistic weapon) that Gatling gun still counts as non explosive for the purposes of “heavy gunner” and will benefit from those perks AND it will count as explosive for “demolition expert”. In short, you get the best of both worlds with an explosive legendary affix on a normally non explosive weapon.
---
Seriously, I had planned to make it a semi-regular series. Now I'll just find a better site to share those stories on. Not one where a bunch of people enjoyed my story, then one mod decided to pull the plug for a completely bogus rule violation, so nobody else gets to read the cool story.
---
You spent part of what you were given. That's why you didn't get a refund. How hard is that to understand? It doesn't matter if it's the main feature of the subscription. You spent part of the subscription. This is nothing like putting fucking stickers in q car. It's like putting 2k miles on a car and then expecting a full refund of anything. But still, nothing like buying a car. You bought a digital currency, spent it and then expected a refund. You're a clown and you're an entitled fuck.

The grenade button.

But it's probably best to use light attacks to save AP

Then quit. Don’t make a public case about it seeking attention or swaying others.
---
I’m on ps4 pro.
---
I saw this happen in a nuked Cranbeery Bog. I killed a bloated glowing one while it was walking in my direction and it kept walking straight through the air after death. Like it turned on no clip and auto run at the top of the small hill and went afk.
---
Stupid NOW?
---
Hi. Welcome to Fallout 76, you must be new here.
---
Matters very little to me at this point, what with completely arbitrary post deletion. I've seen far less descriptive titles here become top posts. If my voice is so completely valueless that what I spent half an hour writing gets deleted for no actual rule violation, I don't much care if this 'ends poorly' for me.
---
You have to prove they cheated, which they didn't. You are making the affirmation they cheated so it is on you to prove that. You can't because they didn't.
---
That's awesome.
---
Sure, but why would everyone do it? Their artist are better served getting actual fallout themed skins into the game.
---
Wow cool, thanks for your riveting input. If you had nothing useful to add why even comment? The whole point of reddit is to discuss things. I’m not “swaying” others I’m asking for help. I’m also not seeing attention either. 
---
What a negative viewpoint you have, wow.
---
I have definitely taken part in killing the queen a few times, but will have to try again.  Thanks
---
\#1 &amp; #2: I don’t deal with the types of bugs and glitches that you seem to (or that others seem too).  I didn’t crash once on PS4 during the Halloween event, and I was there in the middle of it with cars blowing up on all sides.  The worst I had was lag trying to activate the bonfires.  So I can’t relate to the same issues so the only things I can suggest is to try a reinstall - maybe the files are corrupted or something. 
---
\#3: I get that’s not for everyone, I don’t think it’s supposed to be, I am not upset that they added a new mode to the game, even if I’m not playing it very much myself (I’ve made it to 13 just from hiding).  
---
\#4: I agree that some of the prices are crazy, that said I’m not going to get into again the subscription for the private servers (which, to me, is the bulk of what 1st really is about - the rest are just incentives for everyone else) since it was known since before the game came out that charging for that service was on their radar.  That said I do think it would be better to make the stash and the tent available, even if through quests, to everyone.
---
\#5: This I agree with, but it was partly player feedback that got us here.  People would just spend hours hoping servers to get the plans.  Thankfully the higher price has kinda priced them out of reach of newer players.  It takes some trust on the part of other players, but you could use your ability to craft weapons to get mods and offer the service to players to install them.  It takes more social interaction, but between buying a plan, then getting the mats, then breaking them down, players may not want to go through the trouble of getting the mods for weapons and armors (at least the rarer ones) so you can make some profit. 
---
Beyond that, I just play this game like an online survival game.  I don’t treat it like an RPG.  I go out and farm trying to get a perfect set of gear of the style I want.  I still enjoy it, even if I’m playing solo (and going on my private server I can do that mostly)
---
Yea but there's nothing that's festive and fallout themed. Halloween, yes since thats when the great war happened. And besides no one really cares about the lore of skins like ffs we have a pink sprinkles power armour skin.
---
The mods are a joke on this sub they just promote the hate posts because they stir up controversy.
---
Fuck them
---
100% sure you're right. Along with your own experiences, on multiple occasions I've come across headless ghouls standing in goo piles. It's happened a lot when I go to Freddy's on my way to grind the stings n things mission, obviously after somebody else did the same.
---
Damn. Good luck
---
I have a friend with the private server and I have to admit having that was nice. I had the munitions factory for hours haha!
---
Also thank you for your insights. I have the ps4 pro, not sure why I crash all the time. So frustrating. I haven’t tried the uninstall idea maybe that would help.
---
Nah just make a door you can slap in any doorframe.
---
Without context this thread violates the same rule i bet
---
Insanely priced? Get a job...
---
Probably, but at this point I just can't force myself to care anymore.
---
Op would appreciate you just going along with his nonsensical tantrum instead of pointing out why he is wrong, thank you very much!
---
So your experience is different than some other players'. This was a fun post
---
Thx for the questions, didn’t know that as well.
---
Welcome to my world and how fucked up reddit/mods are. So many posts I've put so much time into writing and descriptive titles as well...only to have some fucktard mod or ass hurt reader report at for a violation and it gets removed. So many idiots here clearly breaking rules and clickbait titles that make top posts, while people who actually put the time and effort in get fucked over...
---
Reddit in a nutshell = Short attention spans &amp; even shorter tempers, motherfuckers on here are always looking for a fight or argument over a personal opinion usually, sorry assholes..
---
But not everyone thinks like you or feels the same way about this game. There will never be a shortage of assholes who think they know it all here...this is certain.
---
Predatory capitolism
---
You don't want to kill the Queen, instead you want to Cripple her legs and walk around to her back. There's a lot more to it to give you a much better chance of getting it and it has worked for a few friends of mine. I put up a post about it and several others have as well. Let me see if I can find the link.
---
Downvoted for speaking the truth
---
Lucky the head scribe of my Brotherhood chapter learned all Radium and Ultracite laser mods which r the hardest to learn because they both require alot of circuts to build and no guarantee when scraping 
---
I was just wondering because I didn't know if the .45 submachine gun ever droped with quad as a first legendary prefix
---
But I have a QE combat rifle A QFFR combat rifle and QL Radium the combat maxed out at 85 like a QE Handmade does, but I never checked what my Radium maxed out at
---
I've had that a couple of times today. It seems pretty random, just hiding in my bush and kicked.
---
No need to be a dick about it. This is the first pc related post *not* whining like salty cunts about NW cheaters, that I have read, since Halloween.
---
I've been trying to get Whoopsies and Hot Flashes for months.
---
Any time we fight a queen, I tell my friends not to kill the spawn. I sat there being attacked by 3 of them for over 5 minutes, without getting it. I even had the -50% disease resistance on from RadX or RadAway.
---
Angry Turtle (his YouTube name) has some good videos dealing with ideas for character building. Also a good video for PC users to optimize some graphics....like frame rates, focal distance, and getting rid of grass.
---
Maybe your problem was that it was too descriptive  and no one cared? Can definitely see how a wall of text post can be considered spam.
---
I really want a fallout 3 style nuka cola machine that you can store nuka colas in

Full walkthrough there.
---
I agree, Fallout 76 is a pretty stupid game at the moment
---
You just tap for melee and hold for grenades. Equip grenades and use both just be careful.
---
It's sad that the best way to win / earn XP is hiding. I played NW for the first time in months to get the Jack-O-Lantern Combat Armor paint. The amount of people I encountered hiding in the water, or bushes was crazy.
---
They need to rework the XP table so that kills earn you more XP than being a coward.
---
Oh, I'm sorry, buddy, but you don't get to decide that, do you? First off, you misused the phrase wall of text. Line breaks keep that from being what I typed. Beyond that, it clearly states in the title that it's a war story, so people who aren't interested in such a post can scroll on by, no harm done.
---
So, not spam, not a violation of the lack of descriptive title.
---
Thanks for clearing it up!
---
the thing that gets me about ghouls is when you agro one all the rest come storming at you..
---
in some cases I think it would be more fun to move through a structure that has ghouls in various places throughout than to kill them all in the doorway and then loot an area devoid of mobs
---
New P2W mechanics
---
I’m telling you the decision makers at this company (or at Zenimax) need to seriously be kept away from decision making roles in the future. They are drilling this once loved company into the ground

Me too. But it's too good!

I want to be able to change its color to the BoS variant and wear it with the Enclave Scout mask.
---
Grinded from 3k to 14 last night. Maybe they took care of the bans, didn't see any either. Same guys over and over. One guy I kept seeing after top 10 puts a siren down and runs around. Pretty much a killer in the game, even took out noobmaster and street101 who wreck.
---
Stable flux and legendaries at 20c/star. No outfits or any clothing please. That is all.
---
Run the Bethesda launcher. There's likely a small update.
---
I was playing Adventure Mode fine one day, jumped into NW and got kicked out for the same reason. After googling, saw someone suggesting outdated game files, and it was correct.
---
Nah, at this point, another site is where I want to be. Why waste time getting to know a new subreddit group when my posts will just get arbitrarily deleted for a different set of bogus reasons? What I'll be looking for now is a site where you actually need to be fair and evenhanded to retain the mod position.
---
Yeah players with full auto loadouts is a pain. 
---
I can have full resist perks and marine armor. Lifegiver and still get 2 shot with over 250 resist. 
---
Its lame.
---
O caps because every effect would mean it also had the 250 dmg resist while reload , which would cancel the other effects
---
The Melee button.
---
I know what weapons I want to run with each of my toons.. I started out with non legendary versions of them

now Im vendor shopping just looking to improve them all a little at a time until I finally have my "forever weapons"

Well, I’d consider to developers artists in a way. The company, however, shits all over their vision.
---
I would have bought it if it didn’t have the scrap box or tent

It has 16 times the microtransactions

They asked for an opinion and you got downvoted for going against the shill mentality.

Could you elaborate please? You don’t have to if you don’t want to of course.
---
Where do you work a McDonald's or a Burger King
---
Don’t worry Diablo 4 is coming with full price, payed dlc and micro transactions 👍
---
Captain noob has a video about it. The broadsider has crazy inconsistent damage even with vats.
---
actually he kept trying to convert the locals to the holy glow of atom which generally were level 50+ creatures scorch ghouls and a death claw he did this while taking no stims no rad away only food offered to him and they had to figure out unique ways to get his rads down without taking rad away while talking him out of doing insanely suicidal things like drinking toxic waste and such - and since 12 people were at the event plus the event staff of 3 people (narrator - priest - and co-ordinator who talked to people joining or stumbling onto the event)
---
really the ability to actually play and enjoy the game with others is a major factor of any mmo and having fun and planning events are a major part of a player based games - but hey I've played sandbox style games where you actually have to think for yourself so its not a big deal for people who enjoy liner game play where a story isn't handed to you it is confusing and boring but all games are not made for all people
---
He had the doors wide open for that one.

Exactly good job! 😂
---
I had this happen for a few weeks before they fixed the goo piles. 
---
Every single time I came across one the server crashed a few minutes after. 
---
I saw a post a while back about a naked super mutant and in the comments someone had said something about server instability, too much going on in the server.
---
I’m a L151 melee.  my go to for almost everything ground based is a vampire switchblade.
---
That said -
---
Yogis, SSQs, SBs L65 and higher, mothmen, mireluck queens, cargobots, and vertibots all get heavy weapons.
---
I have yet to get a decent explosive weapon.
---
I have found any LMG (mine is AA) is quite effective against anything.  Any ballistic gatling does much higher dmg per hit, but the LMG is faster.
---
For heavy weapons, I equip bear arms, tank killer1 and stabilized 3.
---
If you are mutated And dont have class freak...one of the melee mutations has something like a -50% on ballistic accuracy.
---
Weaker and need more materials to craft &gt;&lt; maybe they travel faster, idk, there's no need for a reason :(
---
Nice, gg. Thx for sharing tho
---
No worries, I know how you feel, I've been there and that's why I was persistent :)
---
I still check this sub but that one is where I found the community I really love, and it's the mods there that make it possible.

Hope your day and the unrelated stuff get better!

I've been trying this for ages lol I still need Buzz Brain, Dysentery, Sludge Lung, Swamp Itch and Whoopsies
---
Bad translation, like he said tht's just a pumpkin, I made a post some weeks ago because some player could abuse it by selling it as a weapon plan.
---
&gt;Gauss Rifle and Instigating seem to go together since you will in all likelihood be sniping from afar on a full health bar enemy and deliver (hopefully) a knockout punch in one shot. 
---
In theory. Truth is, a bloodied Gauss does better. And I am a fan of everything instigating. You said it yourself: from afar. Dont need health for that. I put my sniper instigating weapons away (he has them all) after trying it.
---
I've never seen Plasma mine or grenade plans in a VM and have been looking for them for months
---
Lol I forgot that hat was a thing xD
---
Stimpaks are usually the only thing I farm and sell lol. I usually carry 90 on me and have 200 for sale at 15 caps each. :)
---
Also both attacks have a sprint variant that adds extra damage. Sprint+light attack or sprint+heavy attack.

If someone is  having that many crashes it's got to be a problem on their end. I played that event 20 times while using my phones hotspot for data. Most oline games won't ever function on my internet. I got some lag when there were tons of people never crashed though. I play on Xbox 1x and s.
---
There was a time early in the release of the game and right after the NW update servers crashed all the time. I play daily and just don't see it much anymore.
---
Loot is tied to a character? In what way? I remember seeing someone comment about this before but they never elaborated on it.
---
Haha yeah, that'd do it.
---
It's even worse now.
---
Still loads of cheaters, the cheaters are just harder to spot, just because they aint flying around in the air, doesn't mean the mode is clean.
---
I’m 100% sure this is exactly what happened.   Everything lines up too perfectly, and “we fixed a bug by making it worse” is exactly what Beth is all about
---
Nope, no value or need for a 1st membership, have 10 accounts and 2 ps4s, can mule at anytime and always $300K available. Atoms are free through gameplay, only hastey fools pay for something you can get for free if patient enough. Bethesda has to earn my money like any other business would, shallow content and a private server you can get through closing a few ports on your end...they have offered nothing but more nothing.
---
Swing Speed is a far more important effect than 90% of the primary effects.  A Troubleshooters SwingSpeed Melee weapon does far better against Super Mutants than a SuperMutants Melee does without Swing Speed.
---
To my view, Ghoulslayers, Troubleshooters, Super Mutants, and Zealots Should All be dropped from the game as Primaries if Bethesda isn't willing to BUFF them to make them actually function as an advantage.  It would be far more fun to have Swing Speed as a Primary AND Secondary (stacked) effect.
---
Yea cause at least for me its working out well. The notes, holos, and computer entries weave a rather interesting tail in my opinion and the micro transactions don't bother me. Most are cosmetic and none kill the game if you don't buy them.
---
Bethesda ruined the balance of certain weapons that were in Fallout 4.  Not just because of damage, but ease of ammo accessibility drastically changes the viability of each weapon.
---
The Handmade Rifle should have NEVER been introduced to 76 chambered in 5.56 because that completely invalidates the ammo type for the regular assault rifle.  It should have been 7.62 like it was in Nuka World to compensate for its extra strength.
---
Same with the Lever-Action Rifle.  It should be 45-70 instead of just .45.
---
99% sure u/Moist_Coco_Pops is right: [https://imgur.com/a/bSCOxuY](https://imgur.com/a/bSCOxuY)
---
100% agree
---
Lucky for you you don't need to imagine as you get to experience it all day every day.
---
Most mobs are location specific with just RNG and people clearing it before you.
---
It's also is affected by who last caused the mobs to spawn specifically their level and if the cleared them out before leaving.
---
They have tuned it a little better for mob level range but the legendary spawn percentage is still pretty random it feels.
---
Events are the only place guaranteed legendary mobs spawn but does not guarantee their rank
---
PS the rate at which mobs that are  legendary that spawn are not consistent if you use uranium fever as a reference point
---
I feel like I have to pump 3 mags into someone (even lightly armored) to get a kill. 
---
Then when I get shot (even heavily armored) I drop so fast I don’t even have time to react.
---
I have a quad, awesome counter against bloodied builds and sentenials. Most dont know what happens when you have a quad. Great for those tesla users too, jist have to aim around them and stay out of range
---
Key word being most instead of all
---
Patience is allways rewarding. Im in the same boat as you, but trust me, I can safely say this is a thing, because the other day I found a red asylum uniform in a vendor for 22 caps. When I found the player on the map, it was like a level 30 something. I felt bad for the dude.
---
You can get a some of them from the BoS vendor = I bought Motion assist servos and Optimized bracers there.  He has others, I just don’t remember which.
---
Calibrated shocks and targeting hud....from what I’ve been told, are SBQ drops
---
Am I the only one who's heartily sick of people who don't want to sit down and read through the forum and expect to be hand-fed updates and changes?
---
Ahh yes reminds me of the old bug from past games where unkillable dead people would attack u
---
I still would have subscribed either way. I enjoy not having to server hop when I'm farming for resources.
---
That basically just described my situation. I loved the mechanics and everything. I waited for private worlds then the pay wall came... i cant afford that i can barely afford wifi and xbox gold. Now they want 100$ a year for a subscription? I played for the longest time with friends...so many left...i had a few remaining and when this happened everyone stopped... Bethesda kinda killed us off. Congrats Bethesda my respect has dropped so low for you not so low that I wont play Oblivion, Skyrim, or the rest of the fallout series besides 4. 4 was kind of boring asf.
---
Lol it did come back long enough to get one. [https://imgur.com/BnB4ky0](https://imgur.com/BnB4ky0)
---
Nah .... but the SMG 10mm is a no brainer for this.
---
With martial artist you kind of achieve what your looking for
---
If the game ran smoothly with minimal bugs I would certainly entertain the idea of subscribing to fallout first but with the condition of the game Bethesda simply doesn't deserve my monies. I have had some folks state they need the revenues to fix the game but again this is ludicrous, they knew what they were launching when the game came out and they suffered in sales revenues because of poor game performance. If only they would improve the performance of the base game before asking me to give them monies with the hope of better service, I simply don't trust them to deliver on their promises.
---
I left after I realized that the game is extremely dull, and the only way they've tried to keep us playing is with grindy quests, barely any new content. 
---
If this wasn't a Fallout game, it would have never made it a year. The name alone is what carries 90% of it's playerbase.
---
that's a \~60% discount. more realistic if it was \~25%
---
Yes. The atoms and private servers are still good
---
sounds like the armor glitch ive been hearing about. people are reporting dying to normal enemies they didnt die to before and their DR seemingly isnt matching what it says in the pip boy. reported fixes include equipping and removing power armor and regular armor to reset your DR. I havent seen this glitch personally, but god damn do I get damage bugged constantly where my weapons do no damage. 
---
I cant imagine being armor bugged and damage bugged.. what the hell is happening with this game.
---
Thank You Todd for my Fallout 1st Membership, I shall bathe in Radaway to remove the stench of the common rabble.
---
Cheers
---
Rude
---
Not to give them any ideas, but yes, I would have just to lock in a predictable cost of Atoms.
---
You need to pay an overpriced subscription to access mandatory QoL features requested by playerbase since release.
---
I’ve gotten the tomahawk plans and forest camo junpsuit off Leader of the  pack in the last week after nearly a year of nothing. RNG is weird (I do Lofp for scrip mind
---
Ngl I'm level 361 on my main, 200 on my alt and never knew this lol
---
Rad-X, my dude. I did what you said and one of my buddies reminded me of mutation suppression like the day after.
---
Subscribed on a Monthly basis, considering paying upfront for the full year.  
---
Thank You Todd for confirming my superiority above the common rabble.
---
I felt that way months ago my man except I never had a problem with crashing even in the beta. I saw a ton of promise and definitely enjoyed my time for a bit but every patch that went by with so little fixes/changes just completely killed any desire I had to play. I am still subbed here so posts like this pop up on my reddit feed every now and then but I haven't seen a single thing that makes me even want to download the game again.
---
Basically the exact same situation here. I miss playing with my friends but after the Fallout 1st debacle I finally hung it up. While I occasionally miss aspects of the game, seeing all the issues since I quit I feel I made the right choice.
---
So to celibate your violation of rule six, you violate rule 1. Good job dude.  
---
(celebrate, lol auto correct)
---
Ah but ESO sucks IMO. Im sure many enjoy it, but to me it feels pretty lame. I hope they remake a standalone version of it, or like what people are doing with Skyrim Together. For now I'll just make due with Regular ES3 Morrowind lol
---
Fook off ghosts
---
Rule 1.
---
Good for camp decoration, useless for everything else
---
It's been that way the whole time in 76 bro
---
Are you thinking of Fallout 4?
---
First, the word is celebrate. I don't usually pull the grammar/spelling police card, but nobody here was celibate.
---
Beyond that, I don't really care anymore. When a good post gets deleted for a violation which didn't actually exist, in favor of endless shitpost content, I don't have much reason to respect the rest of the rules.
---
as do I ;)
---
Vampire's explosive shotguns heal unreasonably quickly, even from a distance, medic's shotguns work very well with other crit enhancing effects, and furious shotguns activate after the first two or three shots if most of the pellets land. Two-shot ffr on a submachine gun with a Scorched Killer's receiver has an insane rate of fire with an ammunition that's much less resource-demanding to make than 308's. Suppressor's effects work well with a Cryolator's slowing ability. +50% limb damage with any explosive works very well (the Crushing Blow from survival is pretty solid even with only two stars). Flamers with a Vampire's effect are nice when using the Friendly Fire perk. I sold a Berserker's +power attack +STR bone hammer, and I thought that was an amazing combination for the right theme. I like the -90% weight effect on shovels and Sheepsquatch staffs, as well as on heavy weapons that can't really be modified (.50 cal, lmgs, grenade launchers, cryolators). Shishkebabs with Suppressor's and +swing speed are good for tanking crowds if you have someone else to dps. Slow melee weapons like fire axes and super sledges with instigating and +40% power attack damage are pretty solid.
---
lol auto correct gives a petty asshat "moral superiority" yet again.  No one but you has stated your post was "Good" so maybe you...posted bullshit that violated rule six, and are throwing a shitty little rant? 
---
If you don't like it here, the door is figurative, but the delete account option's pretty easy to find.
---
I say most due to scrap and repair kits, but even those are kind of just cheap help. Nothing added to the Atoms store has really changed anything. Well, other then the bungalow, I couldn't live with out that sweet baby!
---
Uh, yeah, the several upvotes and positive comments on the post before I went to bed showed not everyone disliked it, so?
---
yeah, I'll take your word for that.
---
Given that I can't post a screenshot either, you'll need to I guess.
---
Yes. Private servers are worth 12$ to me
---
Ok I’ll add you :) and I’m actually quite far along in the main quest I’m currently at the quest “Uncle Sam” but I’ve decided im too far in the main quest for my level so I’ve been playing mostly side quests.
---
No.
---
Fought a super mutant whose arms were raised and sticking straight out like a capital T and every time I got close he would attack like normal then return to T position
---
Where was the moral superiority? You use words incorrectly in addition to autocorrect shenanigans. I specifically stated I wasn't playing grammar and spelling police. I was trying to help you out.
---
Obviously you're too much in your own stink to understand that
---
There's also X-ray, and some folks are running around in lobbies with weapons. If you expect the \_slightest\_ amount of competence from Bethesda, you are a godamn fool.
---
What do you mean anymore? They haven't listened to us ever.
---
Super mutants in the foundry and Iron works that just sit there and stare off into space. 🤷
---
You sunk down bellow the surface detail texture to a rough under-layer of landscape. Don't worry about it.
---
I would occasionally get this bug before the latest patch but now it is more common.  I am seeing ghouls, in the prone, sliding around on the floor without standing up.  This is happening a lot at whitesprings.  It was limited to a single ghoul but yesterday, in the golf club building (by the tennis courts) there were four sliding around while another 6 or so where running around normally.
---
They are still able to attack.
---
I'm on xb1
---
Well fingers crossed for you! I’ve actually also being doing it to give my next toon a lift it! When Wastelanders hits they’ll “find” a tidy stash of level 5 godrolls!
---
I want 40mm grenades. You have 10, I buy them. You have 100, I buy them. I hoarde them. 2 caps Max. Missiles too.
---
Purchased Fo76 on day1, played over 900 hours. Uninstalled after reading the patch 14 note. Bought BL3  and The Outer Worlds the same day. Playing these 2 games since then. 
---
Um what? I watched the video... I didn’t see shit
---
Same here, crashed 10 times in the past 12 hours of playtime. Was relatively fine before. The strange thing is, I wasn't doing much, just standing near Whitesprings station or in my camp near Watoga.
---
&gt; that unlike every other constantly updated game was free for the entire time... 
---
What? LoL is free and constantly updated, Path of Exile is free and constantly updated, GW2 likewise, GW1, Ark, Minecraft, none of them cost money each month, and hell most of them didn't cost 60$ Lol costs absolutely nothing, same with POE and GW2/1, Ark, and minecraft all only have the original purchase price.
---
Hell, minecraft has been getting regular updates for a decade now all free.
---
Fallout 76: Still Fallout 76.
---
20-30 kills from this guy every match ... aimbot and wallhack , 2 shots while in stealth field with no armor damage ...aimbot !
---
Here's what you should be taking away from this.  You don't get to decide if you violated the rules or not. That's what moderators are for. They get reports, they read your post, and go "yeah, that post doesn't belong/needs a different title/etc". 
---
Such as this one. This one deserves to be deleted, as, again, it violates rule 1.
---
Severed soul 😂
---
I sold an explosive 2* one of those out of my vendor for like 15k once. Biggest sale I’ve ever made out of my machines.
---
Using cheat engine to read memory isn't against the TOS, the TOS states you must MODIFY the game. Just looking at the memory addresses doesn't modify anything.
---
Na look at other sub models it's about on par
---
Tattered dress (not the garb of mystery) and the Veil of Secrets are the best costume. The dress can be worn with armor and adds +1 perception, and the Veil doesn't have durability and protects from all airborne damage.
---
Quit then. I just recently uninstalled the game after like 6+ months of not playing and it felt pretty good.
---
What I'm in fact taking away from it is that Reddit mods don't actually need to be good at moderating in order to retain the position. And I don't much care if they delete this thread. I've said what I wanted to say.
---
I would purchase fallout first right now if they would just fix the bugs that have been present from day one for. This isn't rocket science if you can't or wont fix the bugs that interfere with my enjoyment of the game, don't ask for more money
---
Lol.  I have been actively avoiding any Legendaries that had an attribute for power attacks,  as I never knew how to, you know,  DO a power attack.   Until now.
---
Incorrect, just viewing memory isn't against Zenimax's TOS only modifying the memory is. They didn't do that.
---
Fallout themed punk band. Yup I'm gonna need to see this.
---
Every time someone says that filthycasuals mods are "more positive" or "less controlling" I laugh. They curate posts even harder than this subreddit does.
---
So you'd rather they used more nefarious ways of testing this? The fact they use the easiest to detect one shows they aren't trying to get away with cheating, they are trying to improve the game and find flaws left in the code from the devs and finding them to report them to get them fixed.
---
Ditto.  Sneak FTW.  I use an instigating+explosive .50 cal hunting rifle modded out, and with just perks min-maxed, I one-shot many things.
---
If you are a DPS player, this build is not for you, however.  Because of sneak and the rifles reload, it's slow and methodical.
---
I see naked, headless scorched more than supermutants and I see headless ghouls. They never attack me, just stand there in the idle pose. It's mostly awkward to me lol
---
Anthem is waiting for the company.
---
Wait, I can transfer items to my alts?  How?  I’m a 1st sub and had no idea I could do that.
---
Buying the game twice is duping?
---
Bethesda as they are right now, are finished IMHO.  The only game they have on my radar right now is Doom ET, even that I am waiting for reviews from people playing the released game before even considering purchase.
---
I have a 3* bloodied but i want to be tankier. Im sure there are better weapons to use but i like the DOO DOO DOO sound.
---
It's the grenade button (Alt I think?), If it makes you feel better I only really power attack on SBQ and ISS. If you sprint up to an enemy and attack it will power attack also, but seems to not hit at all anyway lol
---
I am building my second character. Oh boy, I’ve got loads of questions. 
---
1. Do you feel underpowered?
---
2. What kind of secondary weapon do you run (explosives, heavy gun, rifle, melee, etc)?
---
Pretty much everyone is PA heavy and everyone else Commando.
---
Really poor variety for a FO game. Balance is nonexistence.
---
Their*
---
Still need help
---
Friendly reminder that still playing Fallout 76 is not okay and has long since constituted a character flaw.
---
Pretty gruff Oi!/street rock tbh, the idea being the Gary's in vault 108 somehow got a holodisc of punk music from another timeline and really got off on the violent sound and worked because they hate everyone who isn't also a Gary. Kinda dumb but was just for fun.

Look at your post history. @mods just ban this fool. He does nothing but troll and all of his posts get removed anyways.
---
I’ve gotten 2 mutant slayer fixers, two vampire fixers, and executioners and a zealots on three characters turning in around 3000 scrip. And one sheepsquatch club on a toon with 100 scrip , which was a) bloodied and b) my new favourite one handed weapon.
---
Right? Im just being honest when I have no reason to have a private server because I have just as much fun on public servers especially since Ive found non duped methods of getting lots of steel so I dont do workshops anymore. I used the private server like maybe 4 times.
---
Don’t forget the statement about limited stash storage because of stress on the servers. Yet here we are with unlimited junk storage behind a 100 dollar paywall
---
How long has Todd been penetrating you?
---
Free Range does this to me. Bramin get stuck or walk in wrong direction from the others. Took forever the other night, then as soon as I got to the barn, a legendary Sheepsquatch spawned and murdered them.
---
It's not all lost though. I ran into a burned out cabin, and pot shot at him until he died. Got a decent Gatling laser.
---
The atoms and the NCR-Outfit are worth it, at least for me.
---
you just read subject lines and then offer your thoughts, dont you?
---
This only happens to me on the Courier event
---
But remember guys, "it's just a game, Bethesda is not that bad".
---
**FUCK BETHESDA!** (the same I say to the minions of this company)
---
Also, make blueprints in Adventure mode (in your camp or in a lonely workshop or something) of stuff you want to build, like a base with some walls, or even a tower.
---
Did you try restarting the game or the console?
---
With how reliant Bethesda is on the fans to actually fix their fucking games I can only hope they realize the road they are taking will only lead to their destruction. At this point all I can think and say is fuck Bethesda.
---
Anyone developing code for Bethesda right now, and is taking any measure of pride in their work, should stop and take inventory of themselves.
---
There's a lot of shame to be had in writing code at Bethesda right now.
---
It's like, praying to a god.
---
It's pretty fucking pointless, but you do feel better afterwards.
---
What's pure stupidity is how all of you people are still playing this shit game =/  
---
Drop it and move on to something else. You're nothing buy cows to be milked of cash in their eyes.
---
u being an idiot is not rocket science either, but you still won't acknowledge it
---
Its not a single festive skin, it is a whole slew of festive and ridiculous skins, and each one absolutely matters lore wise because it changes the aesthetics of the franchise forever moving forward.
---
And most of that commie shit doesn't belong either. The power armor is a lore break.
---
I feel like every time I'm kn reddit people ask this, takes 5 mins to read up on each patch note
---
Hey it’s called private vats 👌
---
Selfish? The guy created that in his free time... How is it selfish to take it down?
---
Yes, I restarted the game and the console, I also Uninstalled it and reinstalled it
---
You deserved what you got supporting Bethesda and this piece of shit game
---
You can now fill your camp with mines all over the place, i don’t know how though
---
I don't believe so but I'll check when I get home
---
Woah, . . . That's kind of insane that you're that far along.
---
Yep! If the tent and scrap boxes were free to everyone, I still would have bought the 1st membership
---
here's what I think: You got so emotionally wound up over in that Bernie Sanders thread, that you brought your emotional whirlwind here and didn't know how to let it go, so you started throwing insults at me.
---
Pro-tip: after almost four hours of endless Bernie defending, and throwing insults at anyone and everyone who doesn't fully agree with his politics, take  a few minutes to come up for air before venturing off into other parts of Reddit.
---
Nobody here earned nor solicited your personal insults.
---
What level is your character? I've been trying to get this for a long time. I'm just curious if you're sub level 50
---
Well good luck. I always keep the weird junkies weapons (especially with explosive effects) I find to pass on the my stoned wasteland brother and sisters.
---
well you probably should have paid for Fallout 1st. Looks like nobody replied.
---
Damn I liked that thing
---
Did you just have a stroke or something?
---
Hackers are only a problem on PC.
---
I think it means each player’s luck is based on his own RNG ratio. Say Bethesda configures RNG to drop a god roll every 100 drops. A player will sort of guaranteed to get a good drop within 100 items he loot/murmrgh. This will make sure even if you’re an unlucky person you get something good at a predetermined ratio.
---
Holy sht that’s a lot of download. Still the same error code? Did you submit a ticket to Bethesda?
---
I don’t know what I’m doing wrong last 200 weapons pulled without any fixer 😐
---
Holy fuck who cares bud. If you quit do it silently.
---
Not everything has to correspond to lore which is something you don't seem to get. Core gameplay elements, yes. Skins and additional content, no not really. It's purpose is freedom of choice and customizability of personal belongings to make them unique and stand out which if you think about it isn't really lore breaking at all even if it were to be considered something that effects the lore.
---
And the commie China stuff does belong because of the presence of Chinese Spies all over America, and in the case of 76 in Mama Dolces in Morgantown.
---
I don't even know where to submit the ticket, surprisingly I keep getting error codes that you can't google
---
Hmm, I've scrapped a lot of standard combat armor, at least 200 helmets. I have BoS for the armor but not for the helmet.
---
If that was a casual player that never reads Reddit, they might never learn what they lost. Concerning the PG plans, they are as rare as the rarest outfits, but the same casual player will just read the plan and think nothing of it. 
---
In other words, you will have to find the needle in a haystack that is a casual player finding a duplicate of it. Unlikely. ;-)
---
 Well there is this:
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_(1995_video_game)
---
 Now if its at all important that you know which way is up, you will not like this game. ;)
---
They have a great website that runs ads. Those ads generate income. Their motivation in doing this is for that ad revenue.
---
I dont see anything wrong with that.
---
Yea i just looked up that code you posted, couldn’t find any result
---
They refused to address the ban and let it stand.
---
the way i have to get 3'd person is by holding ctrl and moving my mouse backwards
---
Maybe it's because my PlayStation network isn't working for the past few days
---
Laser gun plans if anyone on PC has them lmk
---
To submit ticket you can go to their website, i think you need to setup an account first.
---
What’s the last “controversy”?? What shitty YouTuber released a bullshit “datamined” video now?
---
This Is my low level: a 68.
---
Well, at least I've done the first part
---
Not to mention that their games have always been bugged to hell. It's just that with 76 they turned it up to 11.
---
Yeah I just watched your video and winced. RNG is a hell of a drug. That said if I get one usable or sellable gun from 10 pulls of the handle I feel like I’ve come out ahead. Some times you just get garbage after garbage. At least it makes the next bit of daily scrip easy for a few days!
---
 I bought it purely because so many people were upset. I wanted the Ranger Armour to piss these people off. The rest I don't care about. ;)
---
I look for cheap schematics and recipes I don't already have. Even stuff I never would make, use, or put in my camp. If I have the caps to burn. Very rarely do I buy anything legendary or premade, however I did make a small fortune making sets of level 10-20 deep pocket, enameled metal armor (200% condition) when I had my camp closer to  vault 76. So.... people do buy crafted goods. Personally I do not.
---
Oh yea it could be a PSN issue too. I ran into issue before, BGS said ask PSN, PSN told me it’s BGS lol
---
How bout you take you're own advice and not post. We care even less about what you have to say in response.
---
And lose the best flanking tool in the game?
---
No thanks.
---
Happy trails.
---
It's not telling me anything, it's just authentication failed and that code
---
Yes because they keep the crap out. They do not keep out positive content like what it sounds the person I responded to is posting out.
---
There's a difference, it's kind of sad that you're not able to understand it, but that's okay to each their own.
---
He addressed this in another thread. He said if you want to pay his sever fees etc he'll put it back up. It costs him money to maintain it
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/drohjt/bethesda_support_please_do_better/f6mj2c4/
---
Just shows how Bethesda treats their loyal fans.
---
Thanks looks like it's not locked to low level players which is good.
---
Oh once you submit a ticket, you get to chat with a support staff, I think they are real people not bots.
---
Which platform, if you're PS4 and don't care anymore, can I have your stuff?
---
Imposter Santa. An assaultron who shows up at Whitespring, you need to kill him before midnight. Spawns violent glowing radstag as Minions. Fun for everyone.

&gt;Bethesda better nail Wastelanders. If they don’t there’s no recovering from the public scrutiny
---
Do you still believe there is any possibility of something good happening? **BIG LMAO**
---
Lmao the up votes say different bud. These crying posts are annoying. If you don’t like the game then leave the sub as well as the game.
---
Do I need to remember the ticket number?
---
I wish they will introduce something like legendary modules for all weapons let’s say 500 scrip and you can craft 3 star weapon of your choice (obviously with random effects) this way if I want fixer or bear arm i will be able to get some even if effects will be let’s say not optional 😅
---
Imagine caring about upvotes lol
---
So you get monthly atoms for the 1st membership? Darn stupid me never bothered reading anything about it. if they have some nice weapon skins in the atom shop I’m so gonna get FO1st 🤮
---
Are you a dataminer too?
---
Here's what I think: You couldn't find a legitimate rebuttal to my comment on your silly post so you instead felt the need to mine through my other conversations (like a creep) in order to find something, ANYTHING to use as use as a "snappy" come back. Nothing like attempting to demonize a clean energy debate in order to add weight to you view on a video game eh...
---
Yes atoms and private server alone are worth the price.
---
They hit it at launch, this is just them digging
---
I think it does some pockets of closed beta now and then.
---
a fully upgraded vault suit is the best thing on earth. I dont have the stats in front of me, but I think it buffs every single stat.
---
Put it in to world container and then you have 3-5 minutes to come back.
---
Edit: Important don’t drop it in the bag as everything inside the paper bag despawn if there is no player around.
---
No, they could be busy, they do patrol more then just one corner of the fanbase.
---
Bethesda its time to stop🛑,
---
All fair points. But I just dont see a lot of games that have the same size and scope getting updates as regularly that remain free. Well, I mean used to be free. I have to defense for Bethesda with the pay to play shit.
---
Well to me there’s simply not enough stuff to spend the atoms on. I only want weapon and armor skins and already have most, even if they give me 10k atoms now i don’t know what else to buy.
---
I won't say that he deserved this, even if he spent way too much time and money on this game than he should have, because that implies that Bethesda's in the right. I will say it does remind me of an old fable about a scorpion and a frog
---
They will email you when there’s any activity on your ticket, it will show when you login too.
---
Oh, well now I have to cancel it because the game started working
---
You have twenty minutes, and you can drop a bag because I tried last night, but it does take a minute for it to spawn
---
Just proving a point dumbass.
---
lol good for you 😂
---
Can't wait for Todd to take the stage of E3 2020 and promise that Bethesda will do better.
---
Sweet sweet lies
---
If you want a rebuttal, then dont sling unnecessary personal insults. Just make a point if you have one.
---
I didn't 'mine' your comments. I was looking for a summary of all your comments in this thread because your insults were so unsolicited that I suspected you meant to reply to someone else.
---
Stop picking fights with literally everyone.
---
One day you will lose everything inside this bag. Not that i wish it to happened it’s just how bag works
---
Plus you have 20 minutes only if someone else was on your server, I’m able to reliably restart my server by just jumping on adventure mode for couple minutes
---
Thoroughly enjoyed that mate, thank you for sharing!
---
Man,this dumpster fire of a game won’t stop burning.It’s like in Dark Souls where rekindling the flame only delays the inevitable when you might as well just say fuck it and walk away.Congrats on being in a community that is seen as a laughingstock from everyone outside for actually sticking with this game.
---
You can wear the vault suit, armor, and the tattered dress on top.
---
hell yeah, thanks for the listen! Us punks are some of the biggest nerds around. lol.
---
I suspect that Wastelanders will be delayed long enough for THAT to be their e3 Fallout content.
---
Usually, the Zenimax business bullshit seems to be in side games, not main games. But we will see.
---
On this sub all you have to do to get upvotes is say
---
Bethesda always good. Never bad.
---
I still can log in on 2 accounts at once. First one from the launcher and then second from .exe
---
There are no stupid questions, but there are a LOT of inquisitive idiots.
---
I've been coming across enemies that don't react as well. They are invicible, just stand there and don't move. They have a health bar that goes down as I shoot them, but they don't die. Once, one of them was headless.
---
But more strangely, I came across a glowing Wendigo that moved around silently and kind of followed me. He was breathing weirdly (as they do I guess) and looked at me. But no matter how much I shot him, he didn't react or die. No kidding.
---
Tomahawks feel so cool, I crafted over 100 and finish things off after hitting them with a BP pistol before they get to melee range
---
I have maxed cards for both monsters and animals. I get them to pacify all the time. Never once has one shown back up at my camp.
---
Im missing a big part of this trick somehow.
---
Anyone who thinks the Nuka Cola Machine door WONT be a Fallout 1st exclusive isn't really paying attention.
---
It is about damn time they fixed that.  You can work around it by crouching when reloading or quick swapping weapons, but who wants to do that?
---
Well that’s not what I said sooo
---
Well, that’s just you then. lol
---
Bethesda could beat down your door, beat the hell out of you, blow up your house, and you'd still thank them for the privilege, wouldn't you?
---
Well duuuuuh
---
I can run both as well.
---
I stock plans at 20% of the suggested price, and I stock all ammo in stacks of 1000 for about 18 caps per stack.
---
I sell 1 plan per game session and haven't sold any ammo since Fallout 1st. I think that service with it's unlimited junk storage means the market for selling ammo is just gone.
---
&gt; your 
---
You keep using that word. It doesn't mean what you think it means.
---
no
---
I've got a clip saved on my Xbox that's straight out of a horror movie, super mutant kept moving when I wasn't looking, like a weeping angel but naked and muscular
---
Alright thanks
---
Yeah actually resetting the router isn’t a bad idea
---
I mean, idk how it's literally FO4 with different skills when they didn't even add freaking NPC's in the game... An online fallout could still be a really fun game, Bethesda just shit the bed with their execution.
---
Just like people wanting something doesn't instantly make it a bad idea, something being done awfully doesn't make it a poor idea.
---
It's funny how that was the last idea
---
A guy used a cheat engine while 'bug hunting' and one of the multiple accounts he used got hit by the banhammer from the automated system. Naturally it resulted in a giant rant and is now being used to brigdae
---
probably meat week or something equally effortless.
---
Security is an important part of software development. Not in Bethesda's case though, evidently.
---
Honestly, i still haven't actually used the tent. Been too occupied with indulging my Fallout 4 hording habits that it hasn't come to mind to use it
---
Rightfully so, my plague doctor mask from the atomic shop protects from disease &amp; does not give negative effects
---
You’re title was a wild ride. Thought you meant there was something new for me to grind for. Bah. Have an upvote for the great suggestion.
---
I'm pretty sure real world politics and a video game, make believe world are quite distinct from one another creepo. There's also a distinction from having a debate on climate change initiative and an argument.
---
Hey, if you dig a little deeper you may further prove how much of a scumbag I am for defending free healthcare for people who can't afford it.
---
Now back to the topic on hand, data mining for exact spawn  locations of resources in a video game where everyone competes for them is game breaking and gives compulsive players an opportunity to sweep the map clean and control the market.
---
The only point you've made that's inaccurate is the last one. This data miner DOES pay for their shitty premium service and Bethesday still won't do any fucking thing about it.
---
The problem is the games instancing.
---
If someone clears an area, if you haven't been there today it has to re-fill it for you.
---
It only does half the job though...so dismemberment, goo pile status &amp; looted inventories remain
---
The nuclear apocalypse turned out to be the least of his worries
---
Well shit, I'll keep digging around then. Thanks for the info, guys
---
Is it possible to get all of them or is one bugged? Sludge lung maybe?
---
Only 3 times I played nuclear Winter i was killed instantly when i found an enemy, literally no time to react just blink and death. 
---
Gave up after that, not sure about why or how (was an automatic rifle everytime) and don't really care, i got better shit to do
---
Fallout Worst membership is more of an agreement to buy atoms in set amounts every month so no...it delivered what it promised.
---
The extra garbage is window dressing.
---
I'll know you're sincere when you've edited the personal attacks and insults out of your previous comments. At that point, I'd be glad to discuss ANY topic with you.
---
I think that's a reasonable request.
---
"You deserve it."
---
This post is very usefull and nice to see this type of reddit post. Thanks for posting and keep posting!
---
he got a reply. Fallout 1st members always get responses. It's those who dont have it who are without a voice.
---
5.56,cores, fair priced leggies( I like to try different builds), bulk acid, flux and flux making supplies and outfits. I sell outfits because I buy them and know that other people like buying them. Sorry if you traveled cross map. I try to keep leggie armor stocked as well, but I sell it cheap and it goes fast. Chameleon armor sells fastest.
---
No, if you recreate exploits before you report them you could get banned
---
well maybe you shouldnt have bought it without knowing what it is. that doesnt seem like Bethesda's fault to me...
---
Done.
---
Woooooow the rarest outfit for 22 caps. Amazing.
---
Nah
---
Noone said anything about hoarding caps??
---
They should be grateful for anyone willing to try and help fix their mess of a game since they obviously aren't capable of doing it on their own.
---
It would be one thing if they actually had a competent and dedicated team handling the game and testing and fixing all reported bugs, but they've all but proven that's not the case. If they were smart they would welcome any help from the community rather than giving the people who try to help a slap in the face.
---
That’s how I feel as well. Like they should have had this fixed prior to launching not asking for more now that it is launched.
---
I just love some of the unique aspects of this game. :~~~((
---
Exterminator poison resist sentinel left arm, trouble shooter ap refresh sentinel chest, I'm trying to remember what else, I'll be back.
---
Space suit, the only thing I can remember
---
Get someone to come to your sever, leave and rejoin
---
On PC?
---
exactly...fix it and they will come
---
Yeah they listen they are just slow probably not many people working on this game and they are working on wastelanders. Also highly likely no one who worked on fallout 3 or 4 is working on 76.
---
If this is what we're dealing with now, I'm scared of what TES6 is gonna be like since we won't even get a proper game at all, Blizzard is literally killing their own community.
---
Pretty sure it's just the spacesuit. Hazmat suit is pretty sci-fi though. Mmm the science outfit from tech data turn ins that looks kinda ugly might work too
---
I guess I just don't get butt hurt easily like other people.
---
 I also don't hold grudges.
---
Edit:  Thirdly, I love playing fallout 76
---
Simple solution: dont hack the game.
---
 Data mining/sniffing is a form of hacking.
---
I feel like I missed an awesome series because fallout 4 was my first real experience with fallout. But I stopped playing early game. I like multiplayer stuff. 
---
I read that the fallout 4 content is what they use in fallout 76? I hadn’t even noticed if I’m honest.
---
Thanks I’ll keep them in mind!
---
Shouldn't need anyone to go to server, just leave and rejoin
---
just leave and rejoin it will put you back in and the ghouls will appear
---
I'll try
---
I wish I had your game stability and the extra cash, I can see how the farm frustrations come in place! Being on a private server is super nice!
---
The billboard near the encryptid event also had a brood mother. It's marked on the map with binoculars, I forget exactly what it's called.
---
I have stimpacks for sale for 20 caps each and have not sold a single one in months
---
I keep getting bugs with robots in particular. Especially in Watoga. I'll be walking through the town and robots will be standing still and gutsys will still be hovering. But you can go up to there bodies and see an empty loot slot, and if you touch them, they'll fall over.
---
"I can't be bothered to do a 15 second search for the 500 threads already here.  Please take time out of your day to explain it all to me personally from scratch, because my time is way more valuable than yours."
---
From store manager to VP?! I guess it's time to start sending out my resumes to higher positions.
---
Well that sucks. I tried restarting and even leveled up again just to see if it would come up, but no luck. That’s really discouraging because  now I’m afraid I won’t get the other skins. Thank you for your help!
---
datamining: The user in question had created an interactive map helping people find items, objects, quests. It was a glorified and very detailed wiki. On the one hand you have a valid point: in a game that is a race to get resources, mapping them out provides a short-cut to them. All I can say to that is these online resources are available to everyone. They aren't behind subscriptions and they aren't made private for specific individuals. They are offered as a public service. Your point is fair, but my opinion is that these online maps harm no one, and in some cases, are a positive service to the community. Compulsive players are going to find those resources anyway by virtue of being compulsive. I think these resources are best when serving younger players who will almost always lose versus power players, and people who have very limited time to play. Someone playing 20 hours a week will not even need a map. They'll find everything they need eventually. Someone with 4 hours a week to play would find a reference like this something they literally can't play without.
---
Real World Politics: we probably have the same goals, but disagree on the path that gets us there. Too many people think that the path itself is worth fighting over and then THAT becomes the goal, instead. With our vote, we choose a path. We should explore it and see where it goes. At certain points, we can vote again and decide whether to stay on that path or hop over to the other one. It's all broken now because when a path has been chosen, those who dont like it are actively digging holes in it, throwing trees down over it, in order to PREVENT any movement until we go to their path.
---
It's so self-destructive, that history will look back and lay the blame of every failure at the hole diggers. They'll shake their heads and wonder why so much potential was squandered. We are at the point now where it wont matter any longer WHO wins an election. The losers will commit outright sabotage until they have so entirely broken things apart, that the ruling party can't stay in power. Then everyone switches roles and the sabotage continues until it can't be fixed any longer.
---
When that happens, the power brokers take over. The Kochs and the Soros' will have played their game to victory, and they'll be the last remaining superpowers.
---
Rare plans that aren't sold by vendors
---
I really appreciate this because that’s how I feel. Sometimes I just feel like I’m not having fun just doing a chore over and over.
---
I also really hope there some something new, especially a new area maybe? Like a map extension or something.
---
I loved discovering all of the areas in the game!
---
You on PC?
---
So you can't get the +10HP boost for consuming Cranberry Relish if you have the Carnivore mutation?
---
I get normal weapons, ammo, stims, junk. Out of 40 maps I can't recall anything extraordinary. Been trying for PA plans.
---
Like what? Im not trying to be difficult i really dont know....any examples?
---
It worked. Thx all!
---
That’s why Bethesda keeps pulling this kind of bullshit because people turn a blind eye or as you say “don’t hold grudges” could you explain why everything Bethesda is doing is ok? because it’s not and fallout 76 is enjoyable until you realize Bethesda is ruining it
---
If you used a credit card to purchase FO1st then you can file a chargeback. If enough people file charge backs then the credit card company will flag them as fraudulent. Bethesda sucks and no one should support this garbage. It's literally garbage
---
I got a bloody 33% vats hit 25%less vats hunting rifle in my machine for 3000 caps, been there for a couple months. Starting to think no one will ever buy it.
---
What sort of comparison is this? If you can't test a supposed exploit to prove it exists and find out the cause of the problem then Bethesda can't do anything about it. Besides, using exploits in a video game isn't illegal. He's doing what Bethesda won't.
---
Because it pisses people off. Seriously. I love exploring in 76. I love finally having Ranger Armor and can't wait for more to come out. It's not a perfect game. But neither is life. All the hate just blows my mind. The fallout y'all knew is dead. It's called reality. And reality can be harsh. I hope Wastelanders is a smash and all you entitled complainers weren't allowed to return. I hear a lot of people hate the game but NW has had more players since all this hate and backlash.
---
Yeah :( 
---
I want to love this game again so bad. At least got the grafton mayor is finally shut up LOL
---
That moment when uts only real purpose is being in ypur stash because a display case can only display hats...
---
Watoga vendorPhoenix and the enclave bunker for PA plans
---
I didn’t use the private server at first until I had to farm and realized this was a good use. 
---
Also because I caught someone stealing my water and scraps from my collectron box, and proceeded to continue even after I walked up next to them.
---
Plans to craft power armor pieces in particular
---
Then I would suggest you move on to something else that you would enjoy and not dwell on this any longer.  I enjoy playing Fallout 76 and plan to stay put.
---
You know what, probably not in that department 😅 or not as many as needed
---
Good for you no one really cares so no need to share
---
You know they could simply remove the item he bought with the atoms from his account, right?
---
That's the good thing about digital goods in an online game. All you need is a checkbox to make them active or not for your account.
---
Look at Path of Exile for example. Whenever you want a refund for a certain large amount (50$) but don't have enough points in your account (45$) for the refund to be possible, they urge you to buy a small amount of points to reach the amount you want refunded(5$), and then refund you that amount(50$).
---
Bethesda could have done the EXACT SAME THING here.
---
This is simply the easiest excuse that they found to justify not giving him the refund. If it wasn't for that, they would have used some other excuse such as:
---
* Oh, you've already equipped the Fallout 1st skins, thus you've already used the product.
---
* Oh, your account is currently using the scrapbox and tent, so we cannot issue a refund.
---
Don't tell me what to do :-p
---
I had a PA plan once. You can't buy these.
---
&gt;It's like putting 2k miles on a car and then expecting a full refund of anything.
---
So you are saying if the car is broken because it was a manufacturing fault, you are not allowed for a full refund because it broke after you started using it?
---
You dont see the irony here?
---
You gave even a better example for why their response is horrendous than i did with my snickers example...
---
&gt;You're a clown and you're an entitled fuck.
---
Maybe try not to be such a salty fuck instead, then people might even like you.
---
Honestly I wish I was making it up. 
---
Someone suggested I reinstall the game and see if that helps so I’m going to try that. I’m not going to hold out hope though.
---
Ona. Funny note, one of the best glitches I had was an unfinished texture that was bright purple telling me to hit control alt delete lol!
---
I decided to take a photo with it :D if I can find it I’ll upload it cuz it still cracks me up.
---
I personally don't see what they're doing wrong. I still am enjoying the game.  I like the game enough and want it to succeed enough that I am happily paying a small subscription fee now.
---
 I don't care about skins and things of that nature so I don't buy Atam's from the atom shop.  They weren't going to make any money off of me that way.
---
I have been playing MMO's since 2003 and have always paid a subscription so it's nothing new to me.
---
Also there are two by Welch train station, just follow the rail northwest.
---
Hmm I actually have only played my one character I’ve tried making new ones, but it’s so hard to start over with so few perk cards. I don’t know how people do that!!
---
For me I tried to do farm cafe crickets they didn't respawn only of he had a someone to anchor for me
---
Happened to me right next to my camp in the forest, located at the copper deposit near the lighthouse. However, mine were Scorched and they were headless/immobile, so I didn't think much of it. It was probably 3 or 4 days ago.
---
This game is just bad
---
I saved all map till lvl 50 and started using them now. Today I got a t-51b calibrated shock Plan out of a treasure in the mire.
---
Besides that, mostly garbage to sell.
---
Xbox
---
I don't understand the point of adding the -2 perception effect to certain headgear if there's items that do the same thing without any downsides.
---
This is another reason why I really dislike the armor and clothing situation in Fallout 76. It's like at one point they wanted to commit to having headgear and accessories that have statistical differences, but then they changed their mind half-way through, and all clothing items are cosmetic overrides, including most of the headgear that previously used to provide bonuses in Fallout 4 but no longer do so.  But the -2 perception thing for stuff like gas masks, is just like a relic of that or something.
---
I really wish headgear armor/benefits and clothing bonuses were a thing again.  Especially full-outfit armors like cage armor that used to have their own stats as well.
---
I found an invincible Mirelurk, but he was just standing there, doing nothing. Didn't attack me. So I went and took a nice picture beside him
---
Explosives are extremely strong but they tend to break really fast and cost a lot to fire. The auto grenade launcher has pretty insane DPS. The Fat Man is fun as hell.
---
Lol They have to earn your money?
---
You bought 10 copies of the game.
---
Yes, each character has a "seed" tied to their character. Some characters have good seeds that drop good loot and some have bad seeds that rarely drop good loot. Here is more indepth explanation by some dataminers who found it and tested it:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dlrwcq/results_of_14500_scrip_spent_on_the_50_off_sale/
---
Nah ps4 pro
---
Si you’re supporting this? You want to pay for something that Bethesda *should* have put in the game for free “chose their word wisely” having to say that about a company is shady as fuck
---
Ha! Basicly why i asked. I have a million of them and ive been running out of meaningful things to do in game lately
---
At the end of the day the company your talking shit about is Bethesda they don’t have the best track record plus if you going to delete ever game by them just don’t delete new Vegas or fallout 3
---
Yeah buddy I don't subscribe to your hatred, sorry.
---
  I have no problem at all paying $14 a month for a subscription fee. 
---
 They don't ban people for reporting bugs. He was obviously either cheating or using a duplicate exploit.
---
 Just because he had a website doesn't make him a good person.
---
Im not getting on your hatred sheep train my friend.
---
Floor decor - &gt; somewhere below the cat topiary, there should be the bronze trophy. Have you checked for any arrows?
---
No, he means that each character has a "seed" tied to them some character have good seeds with good drops and some have bad seeds with shit drops. Here is better explanation about it from the dataminers that found it and tested it:
---
I'm familiar with Map76 and aside from the point I mentioned, there seems to be more to that story. As a developer myself I find it incredibly hard to believe someone would pull the plug on an entire project just because his account was suspended. It's much easier to simply buy another copy of 76 than to gather another following that site had.  I would not be surprised if he received a Cease &amp; Desist letter from Zenimax and used the Fallout 1st controversy as excuse. We've all been here before with the 900 Hour Guy and it seems like lessons haven't been learned.
---
Now, logically if for argument sake you create an MMO where a major part of the mechanic is the gathering of resources. Some websites decides to data mine your game and reveal EVERY spawn location. It would be disingenuous for you to say you'd be comfortable with that. Wiki giving you a general idea of a resource location is one thing but having an unlicensed tool that pin points everything at it's exact spawn point is another.
---
I'm also not going to have a political discussion on a fo76 sub. That's just silly.
---
More so. I would feel better about my subscription if these gameplay affective elements were free for all players
---
Well it’s fine to play it but defending and paying for their scummy business practices is terrible
---
They sell mod plans, not base piece plans.
---
Fyi. I froze, and had to quit game, but I reloaded and got my nuked WS back...cool!
---
We here at Bitchesda hear you and are delighted to announce this item will be featured in 2020's new subscription service, Fallout 1st 2.
---
Im still sitting on all my maps and will buy any cheap ones i come across. At this point im hoping they add to their loot table. I think they were the source of NV scopes, PA plans, bos and dense plans at one point. Never could find a good guide on what they reward.
---
Shoot. If you were on PC I'd let you jump on my server and give it a go.
---
Not in a way they’ll hear. They’ve been getting protested ever since launch over all sorts of things, they’ll likely ignore it. The best way though, would be to stop playing completely or at least not buy anything from them anymore.
---
By the way what’s this Map76 thing? Never heard of it.
---
Ok but no one is talking about the outer worlds I haven’t even bought it and probably don’t plan on buying it the fact that you have to insult something you think I like proves that you can’t defend Bethesda’s shitty consumer practices
---
RDO’s story mode is only about 1-2 hours long but its one of the best multiplayer experiences ive had with my buddy
---
Yeah, but this subreddit has been generally loyalist, ive heard its changed
---
I thought not supporting a bad product was common sense, you should have seen this coming miles away.
---
There's also the prototype hazmat suit, but I fail to remember where on earth I got that
---
So you're entitled to free stuff because you believe you? Wow..... If you can't produce a link where Bethesda said certain things would be free then you have no argument and are an entitled crybaby. And if you do this is capitalism. Companies don't care about your feelings. They only care to survive.
---
I could be wrong but I though once you get a ticket from a duplicate card, you won't get another ticket from that same card if you get it again. This would put a limit on the amount of tickets people can get.
---
Dense plans were one example.  They show up very rarely at vendors now.  The Treasure Maps seem unreasonably skewed toward Ultra-Light Marine plans.
---
no, I mean thinking Bethesdas actions are ok or not that bad.
---
Reddit doesn't oversee mods of specific subs except in extreme cases, whoever created the sub chooses the mods and is the "king or queen" admin.
---
As a result that can be a huge difference from one sub to the other just depending on who created it what direction they give the moderators they choose.
---
It's not immediately obvious and there's not that many sites that run this way so hopefully this information will help you choose subs that align better to what you're looking for and not ditch Reddit entirely.
---
Wow, you guys make me look good. I sell diluted for 6, regular for 7 and super for 10.
---
I did the event irrational fear to get hot flashes. Just kill everything unless it's a diseased honey beast. Then let it attack you for a while.
---
I haven't played in several weeks, and F1st really pissed me off, but this was kind of the last straw for me because it seems like they are going out of their way to punish their most active fans.
---
we all love the old stuff but I mean the last 1.5 years or so
---
Yoooo nice Kablam! reference!
---
He actually used the bug to see if it was real after someone told him about it and then reported to Bethesda right after and he was a loyal fo76 fan that spent hundreds for dollars on this game only to get banned for his good intentions and it’s not a hate train it’s calling out Bethesda on their bullshit
---
In that case, no point defending the trash heap. Fallout First was the last nail in a very nail heavy coffin
---
I guess.
---
Imo i play because there is some aspects that are fun. And because its fun ill defend it in some ways.
---
I'm pretty indifferent to the scummy stuff as 15 years ago it started happening and now its widespread in most games.
---
The whole concept of blaming ppl for paying into it falls on my deaf ears because its common place in gaming today to have what fo76 has.
---
Fight the system, pirate Skyrim in 2019

With the right build you to make pistols somewhat powerful, despite that, against certain bosses I feel the weakness. This is my build https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=55358ff&amp;d=sb2s01p02pb1c72cu0ic2s12ad2s72ak1ao0al0a00a30l71l12lt2lu1lv2ib1am2eh1el0la1&amp;w=&amp;m=5c29f1&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
Perks like thru-hiker, batteries included and traveling pharmacy can all be swapped out for more damage perks.
---
My main weapons are 
---
Instigating explosive 10mm (for stealth mostly)
---
Explosive 44. 
---
Anti armor crit pipe pistol (stealth as well)
---
Bloodied explosive double barrel shotgun
---
For queen fights I usually just take a Gatlin gun with me.
---
I would always go into a battle with stealth, if you're caught you can still tear most enemies apart with your 44 and crits.
---
So you're taking him for his word. Got it.
---
 I usually come to conclusions after only hearing one side of a story as well.
---
idk how people do it. I'm only able to do it with a shit ton of shotgun shells, radaway, power armor and disease cures. But then again that's when I'm farming legendaries...
---
Exactly a company that only cares about making money not “surviving” is terrible because their consumers are getting treated like money cows that have to pay for bullshit that they put int he game as a mistake only to sell a buggy solution
---
I didnt feel the same, did you have friends who played it alot?
---
It's such a relief from server hopping. Not to mention I can enjoy the workshops in peace. I can hold my own in PVP but some people are relentless and will not quit.
---
Judging by how the game launched and continued to be "fixed" I can guarantee that the people making the game havent played it yet because their is no play testing for quality assurance to be seen
---
Was wondering how people were using blueprints in NW!  Thanks for the tip!
---
You do know people sell them to suckers who don't realize that the locations are posted online, right? A quick google tells you exactly whete they are all at. Like silo pieces, they're useless now.
---
Yeah I am because as I said he was a loyal Bethesda fan as he proved he was one of you defending Bethesda’s bullshit and if he was cheating why would he repair the bug?
---
I love when sheep get curious.
---
Sounds like a good spot.
---
Getting the odd Stimpack when you login can't be too bad either!
---
Another one I'll scout out for sure. Look forward to the screenshot (Does it have your Camp in?)
---
Exactly reddit here to discuss stuff. Not announce your quitting a game. There is absolutely nothing meaningful about this post and nothing to discuss. What do you want me to do try and persuade you to stay. You clearly have made up your mind.
---
bahh.
---
Cabins near scenic overlook is obtainable. 
---
Cabin south east of the sunken hidden church in the mire(alternatively the power relay tower south of the hidden church). Specifically north of abandoned waste dump and South east of Haven church.
---
Follow the train tracks north of Seneca Rocks has a few interesting places
---
Spooky tree house around alpine river canyons
---
Anywhere on bolton greens
---
Interesting structures north west of firebase major towards Sunday brother's cabin 
---
Follow the ridge north of moss town is another cabin
---
I'd recommend hopping between power relay stations and follow the power lines. Those usually provide a good structual base
---
Si you enjoy paying for a full price game? Bethesda keeps doing this because of people like you defending them and paying them they only care about the money, and no I don’t think fallout 76 is shit like I stated in my original post I I enjoyed playing it when Bethesda actually have a fuck about the community so keep paying for bullshit that should be free it kind of suits you
---
Have you heard of the flight helmets? They do that too and have been in the game for a good while already.
---
Nice!
---
That's a ton for me to get on with. Following the power-lines is a cool idea (Common sense too, now that I think about it!)
---
I never was able, Maybe I wasn't in the right areas but still, it was like a flat soda when you expected a normal coke.
---
I've had this bug as early as January, but I can't remember if there were any goo piles. It could well be a similar bug that got fixed and reintroduced. Also had one with a mothman who didn't turn to an ash pile.
---
All I know if they're perfect opportunities for photo ops.
---
You just likened it to a plate of shit so yeah you do think it's shit.
---
 Let's just agree to disagree.
---
You keep bitching and moaning like Eyeore. I'll keep playing the game and having fun.
---
I took some video this morning of naked supermutants shuffling around the exterior of West Tek. They kept shifting around without walking. It was creepy af. And yes, there were some goo piles around.
---
I've done exactly the same thing. Would have paid for the private servers, but because the tent and stash were included I didn't buy it.
---
One is a two handed one is one handed
---
There were times I was a little bored and then sometimes I couldn't put down the controller. I think the game was more fun before it became soft. I liked the fact that I could be killed by other players at any moment or coming back to my base completely destroyed or losing all your junk because you died. It was way more interesting back then.
---
That makes sense thank you. How do you get each though?
---
I jumped on a private server, hit west tek and there were three super mutants in the tank area that were naked (loincloth), frozen, invincible.  Plugged 'em good until I realized they were glitched out.  So I don't think they were gooified mutants unless I got a re-hashed Private Server, which BGS swears up and down they don't do. Also saw a mutant hound that somehow was stuck having spawned partway on the walkway. Other than that the map seemed normal.  Must have been a bad spawn for the location.
---
Are you like sams club , how much for a membership
---
Didn't see the 250dr reloading legeary effect bug listed, this one needs to be fixed I have tons of nice weapons that are useless cause of this
---
Has been in the game since beta. You think they wouldn't know? :)
---
Also there's a structure between tyler county fairgrounds and anchor farm
---
Houses north east of cobbleton farm
---
Interesting, he was able to pull more than 80% ‘meta’ out of one account, if that happens a lot it’s quite destructive to the meta market to say at least. (Depend on what you call a meta i guess). I spent more scrip than him at murmrgh’s, maybe got 10 I can consider ‘meta’.
---
People say quit playing will send a message isnt the best option. They got their money for the game already. What you need to do is keep playing but not buy anything at all. Servers cost money to run and if you playing and not spending money the servers cost them money. If your not playing it diesnt affect them all.
---
Tldr make the game costly for them
---
They used to be rare weapon "boss" drops (only dropping from crowned enemies), now they they can drop as legendaries from legendary enemies or mole mama
---
I'm not saying this guy is in the wrong but I'd like to here BGS's reasoning for the ban. There's two sides to every story.
---
I remember when I got it I sneak attacked two players and it was so fun the firefight that ensued.  but then it was boring cuz everyone wanted singleplayer and played like it. and higher levels are impossible to challenge and the only ones left
---
Yeah, it's ahm. Special and finicky. It works when it wants to on its own time, and GL getting it to work at any moment when it's convenient for you.
---
Thank you
---
Any self respecting person wouldn't force their beliefs on others and accept that everyones taste in games are different.  
---
Making this post instead of quietly leaving is not what a self respecting gamer would do either
---
This game still has no text chat? Amazing
---
I don't defend them, but I find that people are angry for all the wrong reasons.

---
fair enough
---
Most of the reason I still follow this sub is to see what hilarious new ways the game is broken in. Thanks for not disappointing, OP.
---
I still list 4 as my favorite. I just love the settlement system in it.
---
Or maybe OP just understands "out of sight, out of mind" as a concept.
---
Assuming 76 becomes a proper full fledged experience 2 years from now, it's easy enough to say I'm not buying into that scheme if your having fun with other types of games.  Once you reload up fallout 3 and experience the good times, the psychology and curiosity can then take hold and make a "i'll load it up and just fiddle for a bit, see what they've done."
---
The idea "deleting them is stupid" pays ignorance to the fact that their are other game studios with better games and better business practices.  Games are still being made, and their are companies that do them right.  If your incapable of deleting them or may want to play them later, that's fine, especially if you've got the willpower to not "go back" to bethesda.  However, theirs lots of people who can move forward without that nostalgia trip, who can delete them and be unaffected.  Acting as if that's stupid, is honestly sad.
---
Rare modded weapons, like baseball bats. Some plans.
---
Oh nice. I'll definitely check that out.
---
I normally like building in the Forest because it's nicer scenery but that's a cool looking spot!
---
Are you kidding me? Look at the downvotes you're already getting as a start.
---
The amount of blind, almost cult-like devotion to this game and to the company, is outstanding if it wasn't so sad. People throw good money after bad in the hope that supporting the company they loved will return even a shred of that love back.
---
This is coming from a subreddit that is so toxic in some people's eyes that they created another subreddit that explicitly has a rule against negativity. Not a rule against lies or misinformation but neg-a-friggin-tivity!
---
 "But but have you heard about the Skyrim re-release on PS5? You should preorder it" - Todd Howard, probably
---
&gt;What type of genius exploit Hunter would test shit on their main account where they've spent money?
---
The type who wouldn't expect a company to be complete morons about it.
---
People find exploits on different games all the time, but the idea is that if you report the exploit then you won't be punished cause you are helping the game improve.
---
You know it's a Bethesda game when...
---
I also got them today all I had to buy them for 5000c.
---
One story is coming from someone who has made community tools, spent a lot of money on the game, and has reported bugs.
---
The other story comes from a company that has gone back on every single one of its promises, has introduced more and more predatory practices, launches an unfinished project, refuses refunds if a product is not fit for purchase and has to be sued to get refunds.
---
There are two sides to every story, but one of these sides can go fuck themselves.
---
Power armor piece plans, it's how you get T45-60 series. Might not seem like a big deal, but crafted power armor has increased durability. What I mean isn't that it's repaired to 200% or anything like that. I mean the actual durability is larger
---
Dude. They're not from two months in the future. They don't have 2020 vision to see this shit coming.
---
I have a sign above my store that reads “dirt cheap” 
---
I sell everything for the price of ten caps. anything actually worth less is simply free. I always max out on caps from nw, usually hitting the limit. I’m sure I’ve sold some rare stuff I didn’t even know was rare. 
---
I liked the days when you’d find a whole bunch of shit for free in a paper bag in random stations, etc.
---
Widow's Perch
---
Aww I appreciate that man !! I haven’t had a PC in decades! It’s weird for sure
---
a lot of criticism was unfair back then
---
nowadays? even I got my pitchfork
---
I mean, Blizzard is killing their own company, but this is Bethesda. They're doing worse, but still.
---
Easy. Just stop playing the game and do everything you can to turn your friends away not just from Fallout 76 but from Bethesda as well. Don't spend any money on it. Don't even launch the game, no matter what new content or event arrives until this matter is resolved.
---
Don't bother with protests. They're just going to ignore it like they ignored that person.
---
As the old saying goes "Money talks, bullshit walks". Let your and your friend's money do all the talking.
---
I'm not a big fan of forming opinions based on resentment. I'd rather just hear the facts from both sides instead of assuming.
---
Things I like:
---
\- Stimpacks (under 35 caps)
---
\- Cheap Bobbleheads, Magazines, Maps (under 50 caps)
---
\- 40mm Grenade ammo (1-2 caps)
---
\- Plans I don't have (any reasonable price)
---
\- Slightly better versions of my Legendary 3\* Lever Action Rifles or Vanguard Armour (any price)
---
\- Items I need for the daily/weekly Atom tasks (any reasonable price)
---
Things I hate:
---
\- Overpriced everything without reason (theme camps, joke items, etc. are OK, but 200 caps for a Mr Handy Buzz Blade plan is just asking for your cow to die)
---
\- The same things over and over (Ultracite PA plans, Asylum hats).
---
\- Gunpowder, Diluted Stimpacks, anything that draws me to shop at your camp that I clearly don't want.
---
\- Vendors that make it hard to find their machines, use fucking Pungi boards, lock their junk robot &amp; water machines, lock their camp for no reason, set up on a cliff where I spawn at the bottom or fear falling if they log out.
---
What's Map76? Never heard of it
---
he is a data miner, he uses the other accounts for testing
---
That would be an awful idea from Bethesda, the authors of the renamed items limit. I hope it's not true but I'm afraid you're right...
---
I don't have a subscription right now. I'm waiting for wastelanders to get back into the game again, but if they did this it would make me more likely to subscribe honestly. I have no issue supporting games that I enjoy, but don't like when games have pay to win/pay for advantage mechanics.
---
I'll still likely subscribe when I pick it back up just to have a private server with my friends.
---
The electrical tower the other post was referring to (south of the sunken church) is where my camp currently is. I built on top of the train cars with a secret entrance to get inside of them. I made an alt character just to make it. It turned out better than I could've hoped. 😋
---
Combat Armor Dense is my unicorn as well, the only Dense plan I don't have.  But I'm kind of over it.  For one, neither of my characters wears Combat Armor, and for two, I switched over to Pneumatic months ago.  So I gave up the active search for it.  It's too damn rare.
---
I've never seen it at the Watoga vendors, even though it can show up there.  I think the only time I had see one, it was at a player vendor who wanted something close to 25,000 caps for it.  Yeah, no.  If I was hovering near the max, I might do something like 8,000, but it's not worth 25,000 for me.
---
I love the Crushing Blow legendary.  I haven't used it much lately and put it in my vendor for 10k. I immediately regretted it and pulled it out! Lol.  I don't think it ever cycled through the survival rewards either. I got it on the 1st go around and it was challenging to find multi star enemies.
---
"How dare you take this luxury item away from me that you spent your own time, unpaid, to create!"
---
This is why the gaming industry is so shit. Gamers turn on themselves and bend over backwards for corporations. When did gamers becoming mindless drones who cannot resist the next shiny bauble?
---
Wow, man. I'm sorry that happened to you. 
---
I uninstalled FO76 a couple weeks ago after the private server nonsense and this has really sealed the deal. I cancelled my DOOM Eternal preorder. These chuckleheads don't deserve my money. 
---
They definitely don't deserve the community that has largely fixed their last 3 busted-ass-outta-the-box games.
---
You didn't even answer the OP's question. You essentially told him to shut up and move on.
---
Do you want to actually answer the OP's question?
---
Thanks for answering, here’s hoping :)
---
All the people who hated this move have been talking about it. It's all they talk about when they aren't secretly playing NW
---
I think rad damage has been buffed. But it could be an armor bug. I just fight them how I fight the Yao guais or the mirelurk queen: destroy a leg, destroy a leg, destroy a leg. A bit of a sadist, but it works.
---
Why are the 2 "average" accounts so drastically different?
---
I keep acid, lead and ballistic fiber safe.   The rest gets stolen, when i don't back down from asshat players picking fights.  You fools can't deny it gives a clear competitive pay to win advantage, and SO MANY of you people are paying up it's absurd.  Keep paying $13 to blue screen and have an unfair advantage.  I have a shit ton of top tier gear and weapons, that i can't just scrap, taking up space.   And yes i have a mule but its a pain in the ass to transfer items so i just stopped doing it.  How any if you are arguing with me and defending this nonsense is laughable.
---
See you when Wastelanders comes out
---
it has been bugged for like half a year, that's why they decided to launch Fallout 1st, so they can get a budget to fix it
---
in other news the gunfire sound looping indefinitely has been fixed like 10 times already
---
My proposed effect. Doubles sneak attack damage. Nothing else. If you pulled a SE90% Gauss Rifle with this proposed effect, it would be a god roll for pve and pvp if survival mode ever returned.
---
&gt;The norm no matter the game and company is you report it period.
---
That's what he was doing, actively searching for it or not is irrelevant as long as he reports it without sharing how to do it with the public.
---
I'll just do both. Playing Outerworlds as I type.
---
I'm a lucky guy I guess
---
People already have in the 5 thousand same titles posts before this one. It's a moot point that people only post for attention.
---
Well... Lag can be your enemy. Sometimes it triggers after I die, usually during Scorched Earth.
---
I like this typo. Cafe crickets.
---
5.56 for 1cap each, plasma cores for 20-50 caps each. Flux, rare plans. When im near the cap limit i look for good weapons like AAE, AA25, BE, B25, and TSE if they are around 10k-15k caps. Stimpacks when im low on them. I don't buy alot of chems, because i loot more than i use.
---
What ppl usally buy in my camp is plans, junk like screws, gears, springs, adhesive and aluminium, half good weapons sells pretty easy if it not to expensive. I just lower the price on stuff if they stay in the shop for too long.
---
Get annoyed when players are selling bloodied or anti armor weapons for like 15k-25k, when the only good effect on the weapon is the prefix. Its not that i need it. I wouldn't sell those weapons for more than 2k. Also get annoyed when they sell non-legendary weapons and armors. When i fast travel there i expect them to sell alot of legendary armor and weapons. Its good for new players that are scraping weapons and armors to unlock new mods i guess.
---
(i'm level 480 heavy, and level 200 stealth commando)
---
I had no idea that people still play this game
---
Last Beth game I bought is FO4, and it will stay that way until they start behaving like a video game company like they started and not like an entitled corporation like they are currently.
---
&gt;I’d personally volunteer for phones and live chats if that’s what it takes
---
  Is this something companies could do or would it run into labor law issues? I thought thats why most places give some kind of swag/benefit for helping them out to make the distinction.  I know it's not really an issue for say political campaign calling and such but this(Beth) is an established business.
---
He was testing it as pointed out himself, So again he went beyond what most companies ask for. Or do you really believe every person that gets caught using an exploit doesn’t immediately go to the excuse they were just testing? Brought it on himself and now he’s sulking and throwing a pity party.
---
So the answer is no then. Ok. That's pretty sad you're commenting on one of the "5 thousand same title posts", contributing nothing to the conversation.
---
But then again, you can't even defend your position of why you support Bethesda so I'm not even surprised.
---
Yeah, I was mainly going by the fact out of 37 pulls 29 of them were "meta" items. At that point it wouldn't take that many meta pulls to end up with identical items just because the meta pool is so small.
---
I mean ... thank you but is club fuzzy some sort of weird loli underground in 76?
---
There are two options, Player Vendors or SBQ. Good luck obtaining those plans from her tho, I've been farming the SBQ for a while and I rarely see any good Ultracite Plans. I just get the same recycled ones, I don't know if I'm really unlucky or they made them on par with trying to obtain serum plans when they were a drop before. But your best bet is testing your luck with the Queen regardless. If a vendor has the plans you want they aren't going to be cheap, you'll be lucky if you find someone selling one for less than 10k.
---
 I'm glad I'm not alone. I was thinking it was my xbox
---
Nii-chan, No.
---
and not long after you have more caps than you know what to do with.
---
In the modern gaming industry you want whales who act irrationally because they are easily addicted and exploited.
---
I have been testing sneak and I went full sneak after this testing. Yesterday, few months later, I retested sneak and I've seen no results in sneak performance between my full harder to detect set, chameleon piece, escape artist and sneak perk and this same guy but no armor and no perks. I haven't seen a difference.
---
I've often heard from friends that fought me that I'm hard to VATS as fuck. Now everybody is.
---
" banning data miners who are providing RESOURCES for players (detailed maps, quest solutions)"  
---
wasn't banned for this, though. The rules say "you can't ban" and the game automatically ban anyone found to use that cheat. He should get in touch with programmers or community managers. (or support, praying it is a different one. I was able to get some comments unbanned in the english quora via the italian quora support)
---
You're assuming they don't laugh their asses off when they see complaints and rage. 
---
You ought to work in a call centre and meet a few lifers, people who breathe malice and misanthropy.
---
Time for my weekly visit to this sub to see if the betheshills are gone and the game is truly on the right track (and worth playing). Haven't read this post yet, hope it has some good news :D
---
Look at you dodging answering the question again. You do not disappoint.
---
The old formula was a risky one. It’s why Fallout 3 got made by Bethesda instead of Interplay. Make money all year every year is far more stable than make a huge pile of money every few years. There were likely investors for Skyrim and FO4 too but the industry was changed by mobile gaming do now investors expect revenue streams rather than large piles every couple years.
---
The only thing reporting bugs will do it get yourself banned.
---
Go to photo mode gallery and there's a button to set a picture as your new picture.
---
Well I made multiple people throw out their assassin sentinels and go for assassin sneak, and now that it's broken Ive got a lot of unfucking to do xD
---
Bethesda's running their reputation into the ground. They put less effort into this than ubisoft does for honor, and that's embarrassing.
---
You do though. I've answered many times before. I'm not becoming embroiled in your cheesy posts.
---
This was the first of heard of it. After googling it, If it is real it would be kinda cool if it organized into some kind of prolonged civil war in game.   I’m not much on PvP but this could get me interested.
---
Biggest mistake this dude could make is expecting a company like Bethesda to give a single fuck about good faith. If you give this company any money at all, I have no sympathy for when you get screwed.
---
So in case you were not aware, we work directly with the community managers to do this exact thing. It wasn't the reporting of an exploit itself it was the testing of others as well as checking to make sure they fully fixed a security flaw that was found. Bethesda doesn't actually have a team to find this stuff out and players are their best bet at information in this regard.
---
How do we get Bethesda involved in this? I called some little punk ass kid out using exploits on my team and he said.. "I'll disable them since you asked"  
---
Like Foh, ruining the game for others.
---
I can’t. The only options I have are “enlarge, delete, exit” and if I enlarge it the options are “delete, hide UI, back”.
---
I worked Apple Support for about six months.
---
The *people* weren't so bad but our orders from the company were universally bullshit.
---
The black iPhone 7 that had issues with paint peeling off within months?
---
We *knew* it was a factory defect but the mandate from the company was to offer looking at phone cases, ***full price phone cases***, at the Apple Store with the customer. End. That was it. No other options available.
---
For Europe/Australia? We were told to intentionally and deliberately ignore consumer protection laws unless the customer threw a fit over them and demanded that they had them and that they applied.
---
etc, etc, etc.
---
He doesn’t work for Bethesda so how am I turning myself over backwards for the corporations. Yes they screwed him, but let me put it this way. Imagine as a person who has a Salvation Army soup kitchen where they are helping the needy, a town official made a choice to ban the person running the soup kitchen, the owner of this soup kitchen tries to get his ban repealed but with no luck because the government is shit and doesn’t do a good job at replying. This person then decides to say Fuck it and shut down the soup kitchen that supplied all the helpless and left when he could have just passed it on to someone else or left it open in hopes that the needy could figure out how to operate it. Us the gamers are the helpless and the soup kitchen is Map76. See where I’m getting at?
---
This isn’t a bug, its because several items at workshops are actually scripted as “player owned placement items”. Just like at your own personal CAMP , structures can be destroyed my enemies and NPCs. 
---
This was really funny during launch tbh, when someone would come to another players workshop, sometimes a door or a desk would get shot and then you’d become Wanted for attacking a players base 😂
---
You, I like. I'm the guy that logs in just to peruse vendors for plans.
---
Well too often in this sub and really internet discussion in general people equate pointing out bad arguments or false statements as defending something .
---
Too bad, but thanks for reply
---
I got the plan for the T-51 helmet today from a Cranberry Bog #4 map. For some reason, and/or at least for me, finding PA helms in the wild is incredibly difficult. I’ll be crafting them and attaching the Targeting HUD for sale now.
---
if they get rid of all the bugs, it might make their customers have too high of an expectation for their next product and actually demand a more polish. better to keep making them go "its a Bethesda thing"
---
Pretty much
---
yeah i didnt really care about the duffle bag or the jacket or the dark rum or any of that. a lot of them were inconsequential by themselves and it seemed like people were being petty by being so harsh on bethesda at the beginning, but just the massive buildup of all these things over the past *year* has shown me that bethesda really has no idea what they are doing. 
---
really makes me wonder if this is all happening because bethesda doesn't have a game coming out for a while and they are panicking trying to support themselves while they make the transition to next gen with starfield and ES6 and whatnot.
---
You wasted money and time on this game I feel bad for you and anyone else who plays this trash
---
There are plenty games that come out and do ok for majority of player or if they have bug the upcoming patches fixes those issues with weeks or few months and don't go too far just look at No Man's Sky it had pretty bad lunch but within a year the game is playable and they r releasing/released a free dlc for those who own the game and vr support. So it is understandable to have game to come out with few bugs but its nt really good that if a game has bug fter a year of release. Now if u r enjoying ur fo76 thats good be happy bout but don't think because u have knowledge bout programming u can deny people's right to demand for working game. Idk wat software company or gaming company u work for but if u make a game or software that has bug after year then there something wrong fundamentally with they way you guys handle QA. It's ok to be fan and protect what u enjoy but don't try to deny the obvious.
---
Trying to find urban scout gas mask...  no luck yet.
---
This. ^
---
Sure buddy, sure.

Hard nope.
---
You're comparing this quick money scheme to an actual working game like For Honor?

Are there actually any FO76 dev's on this sub?
---
I'm cuckoo for Cocoa puffs!
---
Heh. Just cashed another 1000 scrip got another two fixers. Ghouls and assassin’s explosive. Maybe the later is valuable idk
---
yup, would love a new trailer :)
---
Yes it is real. We have groups on PlayStation, PS4 and PC. Also on discord and Facebook
---
YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM why would you blindly support this company who has time and time screwed there customers absolute brain dead moron

If you kit it out to be a sniper rifle with a sniper build it'll be a decent piece.

Theres like 5 in my camp rn
---
Well for some of us the party never started because we weren't cool enough to join your club. Thanks for rubbing our noses in it. This is Chet Del Monicos graduation blowout all over again. Pfft.
---
Yeah, This year (more accurately the past 2 months) made everyone question Bethesda and no one is standing up for them. The few that do are saying the programmers, not the execs are being blamed. Bethesda has no more crazy fanboys whispering what they want to hear. They're testing water and they finally hit the deep end. Right now they are planning. And also your the only negative person here. I was wondering if this game gets defended.
---
Show me the ingame model of the Floaters!!! please &lt;3
---
I think they should give the scrapbox to everyone, and I would be good if the never came out with the tents, seems like to many overlapping spots, stopping real camps and thier juicy vendors. I am a 1st member and totally would have joined without both, but I must admit I love my scrapbox.
---
Always looking for the urban scout gas mask.  And stable flux.  There are still a few plans I don’t have too.
---
more like they just hired a team of modders to make the game for them, but a team of random modders probably would have done a better job anyway.
---
I’ll do you one better. I don’t think it needs to be defended and that it’s meeting it’s original goals and purpose.  It was billed as Fallout with friends, it was an experiment in multiplayer from a studio that does single player open world, and it was intended to develop a new team for the studio so they could juggle more than the two IP they are known for. 
---
The game was attacked out of the gate because it wasn’t Fallout 5. It’s continued to be attacked by self-declared “saviors of gaming”, Bethesda haters who have made bad faith arguments, poor marketing that didn’t make the above aims clearer, and a pile on of “content creators” who started whipping up the mob because controversy equals cash. 
---
I regained interest in the game when Fallout 1st was announced because it meant a stable revenue source to build out the team and get things fixed. 
---
If you disagree or feel that I’m a deluded fool, well honestly, spare your fingers and brain the bother. I’ve read all the fiery polemics and there’s nothing new or interesting to say.
---
Why don't you head back to Fortnite?
---
For Honor is hardly working right now. Ubi guts moves instead of fixing them, over half the old characters haven't had decent reworks since launch, and all DLC characters are better in every way, either by better, custom feats for each character, or unpunishable bashes that guarantee damage. Ubisoft isn't focusing on actual balance, but on releasing new broken, unbalanced characters.
---
I don’t fortnite but atleast epic doesn’t screw its players
---
Should be in misc structures, all the way to the right
---
Mr. President these class divisions must come down.
---
Trailers cost money to produce, and in this case probably wouldn't net them too many sales.
---
Everything ZeniMax does is cost:benefit examined. Don't expect them to do anything that requires effort for free.
---
naw.. its worthless... if youre on PC you had better give it to me to dispose of for you.. heh
---
Hold down V (in a non-build area) and move the mouse forward or backward to change third person zoom.
---
Very suave and sophisticated crickets.
---
There is nothing
---
Great theory! That's actually a really old bug though. It's been around since at least March of this year as I have pictures of me and my brother posing on a naked super mutant. 
---
So kind of a shitty bug, but when you realize you can do anythi mg with them at that point, you can at least have that "fun" that Beth games provide with their "intended features."
---
Yeah, I had this happen yesterday in Harper's Ferry all over the place with ghouls on a fresh private world. I think it's more likely a syncing problem.
---
Don't game shame us, boomer.
---
Probably one of the better combat rifles. Although bloodied, and furious would most likely see a higher damage output. Overall
---
Ffr and fr are kinda wasted on Insta ime
---
If that's how you feel then why the fuck are you even in this sub? Just to shit on people who have a different opinion than you? Seriously dude if that's your attitude save yourself the stress and raised blood pressure and just leave.
---
If you have a bloodied or instigating sledge (or other high dmg melee weapon) you can 1 shot them, but you need a good melee build and power armor.
---
Sneak/sniper is also viable as you can headshot them with VATS (and target next one using the Gun Fu perk), but you need a good rifle with a supressor.
---
You're right. However if neither testing nor public image are of any concern to Bethesda or the publisher, and map guy has yet to hear from them, then requesting permission would have likely been denied too, but I digress.
---
Just thought I’d try and wake people up. Also sure you guys might have a different opinion but the fact is the game is dog shot and Bethesda are dog shit
---
Uh oh you just found a bug and reported it prepare to get banned
---
Why are people after whoopsies, hot flash, and that claw one, but what benefits do they give? So far ive only seen things like -2 luck, etc
---
Interesting, Ill check it out then! Hows the gameplay and combat mechanics like? One thing I honestly never liked about ES and FO is the combat, VATS helped in FO, but having only played 4 extensively (15ish hrs) and not the others, I dont know if it was better there, but there it always seemed like an afterthought to make super rpg like, not necessarily a game mechanic you had to use to progress in a decent way. The combat is ES wasnt great either imo, tho i only play Oblivion alot, Skyrim and Morrowind barely.
---
Agreed. I don't play it, I just watch from the back all that is going on. The latest thing they did by banning that person who did nothing but to help Bethesda and the community was the last straw. Aside from not understanding why people continue to support such a lack of respect is why Bethesda is acting like this. From afar, it looks like they're sabotaging their own game on purpose to move on because they couldn't simply tell the news Fallout 76 is being discontinued.
---
Don't let the unsubscribe button bite you on the way out!
---
The road to hell is paved with good intentions. There's obviously a new, tougher policy regarding exploits (probably similar to the one ESO has had for a while). One of 0 tolerance. I mean, really, when you perform an exploit in a game, and then send in evidence that you did, what did they think was going to happen? 
---
The outrage over this is kinda ridiculous. Don't want to get banned? Don't intentionally seek out exploits. You can report them WITHOUT "testing" it.
---
It's just for a challenge! If you get all the diseases in the game (not all at once, just have to have had each disease at one point) you get 80 atoms
---
It just blows my mind that anyone still throws money at Bethesda for this game.  They’ve shown time and time again that whatever they promise...will fall extremely short.
---
Oh dang, I didn't know that, thanks for the headsup :)
---
Because people are morons man they just blindly follow the company and open there wallets they’re part of the problem of people didn’t spend money and the game died maybe they would wake up but unlikely
---
Where are all the fanboys to go to bat for Bethesda now? Lets see what happens when this greedy company loses all of its fanbase! Best thing for Bethesda to do is sell the fallout series to a company that actually cares about there games and players! Just remember without players your game, subscription service mean absolutely NOTHING!!
---
No. It's from Polygon and not from that Jason person people generally respect for leaks.
---
Nah, just everyone else with their exclusivity deals.
---
I’m not even subbed 😂😂 I wouldn’t sub this shot show of a sub
---
Ok Zoomer
---
Bethesda is actually pretty uneven with this. I found a duplication glitch, duped 3 assassin's pipe wrenches and sent it in with photos/videos. No actions were taken against my account. I got a response and eventually it was fixed.
---
They still haven't patched a soft invulnerability glitch I sent in months ago, but you win some, you lose some.
---
Just FYI, Tencent owns a portion of Reddit through investment. A portion of all gold goes directly into their pockets. If you even remotely care about the Hong Kong situation, it would run counter to your interests to send any money into the Chinese games industry.
---
Epic fanboy
---
That happens inside the Asylum as well.
---
It's not optimal as a sniper rifle but at the same time it ain't bad either.
---
He told a community manager lol If you think a community manager is actually taking those reports and doing anything but dumping them somewhere you're kidding yourself. More than likely he's been lucky for a while and his luck finally ran out.
---
I don’t even play any game that they own hardly a fanboy
---
Map 76 was a project run by a dataminer that essentially was a map of fallout 76 with item spawns and other resource nodes displayed on map. 
---
Recently the creator has been caught in a banwave for using 3rd party software to show these locations. ~~To be clear, there is no evidnece of him changing these non regularly observable in game values, simply observing them.~~
---
Edit: It would seem his ban is related to a exploit that was patched and he had a hand in reporting and figuring out. I dont know that they ever had an advantage, and to my knowledge it was something to do with account security. If i remember correctly, since he performed this exploit in testing one of his characters got banned.
---
&gt;when you perform an exploit in a game, and then send in evidence that you did, what did they think was going to happen?
---
I've been saying the same thing.  Also, anyone can use this excuse for any sort of nefarious activities.  "Yeah I was using an aim bot in NW, but if I didn't, you wouldn't have known that it needed to be fixed."
---
They are proving that the rules can be broken by breaking the rules.  When you break the rules you get banned.
---
So you're here because you've got nothing better to do than to be shitty. Got it. 
---
Imagine how sad someone's life has gotta be that *that's* what motivates them.
---
Seems pretty basic to me
---
That’s false, no new game engine.
---
The what??
---
😂 I just woke saw the news that Bethesda screwed its players again just tho it I’d try and wake people up
---
Damn, that sucks 😞
---
So, you honestly believe all of the dataminers in different datamining discords, split up by infighting, and all kinds of other bullshit over the past year, ONLY use their resources to benefit the playerbase? 
---
Would you be willing to bet money on this?
---
Good because they are screwing many people with their exclusive crap
---
Given that I didn't even know that you'd existed until now, I hope it's worth the closure.
---
I don’t agree with it but that’s nothing compared basically scamming your players
---
Nice find! There’s some good info there thanks.
---
All you have to do is play the on a different launcher play it on console or wait a year
---
We deserve a more responsive Bethesda, one that actually sticks to its promises and commitments.
---
I'd be perfectly fine with Bethesda doing what they've almost always done and leave trailers and PR until the very last minute.
---
Fo76 lost a lot of money at launch. That's why the shift to a continuous revenue stream. They can't justify keeping it online if it's just bleeding money.
---
No pretty sure you can buy a new on in the bunker.
---
nope , you get the hat and suit from the main quest
---
Would be a perfect roll for the hunting rifle. But it's pretty decent. I'd use is as a secondary rifle in my build.
---
Na mate you get it as mission reward
---
Where did you hear this rumour from?
---
I really doubt they'll go with a brand new engine over overhauling their current one.
---
Mole outfit helmet has all the armors now :P
---
What's your source for this?
---
hope you get a life. Unsub and go downtown and get laid your wasting a beautiful Saturday. Your mom's basement must be pretty stuffy if you're coming around here with that bullcrap.
---
I doubt that's accurate, I've submitted clips from Twitch before. Last time I reported someone I included a clip and I haven't see them since.
---
The Egg Head and Bird Bones serum, cannot find either. Side note, I'm interested in egg head because +6 seems a lot, and I understand intelligence relates to crafting and xp gain. Is it worth getting with class freak 3?
---
If Wastelanders is good as it sounds and dev team are genuinely improving it to be the biggest expansion yet then Yes I wouldn’t be surprised they end it there because it’s not like Fallout 76 is the end game. Fallout 5 should be the next big project so let’s get this Wastelanders expansion and enjoy it and move on like all games franchises do.
---
Someone who claimed he knew someone who worked for Bethesda... could be total bs 
---
He said that it's what was needed to get rid of the bugs as otherwise they can't be fixed and that this was why wastelanders is taking a while.
---
any publicity is good publicity. They are cleaning up off this it they wouldn't be doing it
---
Dupers, try not to pick any of those up.
---
It does, I'm wondering how you haven't seen it. Just scroll down a little ways, open and read the posts criticizing them for the subscription, demanding that everything be free, not just the DLC as promised.
---
Sounds like you're the one having trouble letting the game die. You're not going to convince anyone of anything with the approach you're taking. Just move on man.
---
lol, what are you talking about. dont use cheat engines, da fuk lol its a simple concept. cheat and get banned.
---
Yeah, probably.
---
How does fallout first justify it? There's nothing wrong with trying to bring some revenue into a game that's bleeding money.
---
A source for either side of the arguement would be great. But I dont know if any would ever be provided and its probably just theorizing what could happen. 
---
I **could** be a millionare next year as well.
---
Probably not but worth a shot
---
plans, rare mods. got the armor radium rifle armor piercing mod off a forest one last night
---
 Show us on the doll where Bethesda touched you.
---
cause this game is fun as fuck
---
1 I’m not subbed 2 it’s Sunday 3 this game is wack
---
it looked like trash
---
Hmm, interesting proposal. Perhaps a bit too strong, but I definitely understand how Sneak attacks make sense.
---
Why do people still play this game? It baffles my mind that there people here that still believes in a company that keeps on screwing them over and over. STOP WASTING YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!!
---
Who do we have to murder so that shit like this stops happening?
---
Same, I still play with my wife but I won’t get back  into it heavily until Wastelanders
---
You deserve it.
---
Yikes, thanks for the info
---
Besides killing whoever it kinda is. I don't think you can lower your weapon by choice. Maybe I couldn't figure it out.
---
I'm unaware of any dupes currently working. If you are please do report them.
---
\*Yawn\* man...these are getting so tiring...
---
Had this happen trying to take the Energy plant workshop. Couldn't take it because of one scorched who was standing still and its health would redrawn as soon as it was at 0.
---
*Unless there we people above you*
---
Or the mines started on the floor and shot up into the sky from a clipping issue
---
Yes, very old bug
---
And now I get downvoted by the masses, because my above is a very rare, and difficult to replicate **bug**
---
I’ve never seen so many drop in rain though, usually only 10-20
---
Bethesda, what exactly is your fucking problem?
---
Who exactly do you think you are?
---
Guys, ditch this trash pile. Bethesda has literally ZERO respect for ANYBODY. This is some of the most obvious disdain for the hand that feeds them I've ever seen. There's better companies worth our time. Morally and professionally. There are indie games out right now built better than this shit, and they don't having this underlying hatred for their fans either.
---
Seriously some of the worst shit out of this company. Sell the fucking Fallout IP, it's a disgrace you shitheads have it.
---
like for me, I never use Shotguns or handmades. I get Explosive shotguns but no handmades. I get Explosive everything but handmades. I've also never gotten a hunting Rifle. I think your RNg seed is affected by what weapons you use but maybe that's just me.
---
Here is an unpopular opinion: Bethesda banning his alternate account and not giving him a refund are perfectly reasonable. 
---
Let's start with the refund. He used up the atoms that came with the subscription. If they give him his money back, you create an infinite loophole. Purchase FO1st, spend the atoms, get a refund, repeat; infinite atoms.
---
How about the ban? He tested out an exploit, reported it to Bethesda, and they *actually acted on his report* and banned everyone who used it. Should he have been banned? No, but it makes sense he got caught up in what was likely an automated ban.
---
The only thing that irks me is how the website owner is trying to weaponize outrage for selfish reasons by holding his own website hostage. "Upset my website is down? Blame Bethesda for making me angry." Nothing is stopping him from continuing his work. He has the right to take down the site for any reason. His reasons are selfish though. Nowhere in his explanation does he cite financial strain. He runs ads which probably helps him break even and potentially profits. He himself states $14 bucks is nothing and has spent hundreds of dollars on atoms. This is about "principal," he says; this looks like spite, I say.
---
A new engine with the same features would take many years to make.
---
If it helps me and a friend goo-ified super mutants outside of westek on a private server to see if the goo-ified respawn fix for U14 was actually fixed and what we got was supermutants did respawn but were unarmored/unarmed and teleporting all over the place - they could be damaged but wouldn't be killable and would regen their health similar to the infamous damage bug and using a melee weapon which has always fixed the damage bug for myself did not work in this specific interaction. Hope it helps
---
I got that bug in the same way during the BETA. Don’t they have 3 studios working on this game?
---
It would make sense though. Having a new game engine could well get rid of a lot of bugs. I believe it is also technically possible but would require a lot more work on Bethesda's part. 
---
Maybe just wishful thinking.. just glitched out after running a silo and doing the queen to the buzzer of death.... again.
---
There is currently one, involving things you can throw and pick back up
---
I use railway rifles all the time and heavy guns second. I get heavy guns all day long but no railways.
---
a very great many
---
I don't use bloody and I'm able to drop a scorched beast and a room full of ghouls faster then my friends.
---
I could charge for my deep discounts.
---
How does $14 a month or $100 a year sound?
---
Ahhh, yes. I actually forgot about that one. Very similar to the lvl 1 leather pieces. Is it not?
---
sneaky Unyielding mutated to hell bloody or junkies handmade sniper. Dime a dozen
---
Would it not just work like an emulator and essentially your just changing the software it's running on and not the game? Can you explain a bit more.. really curious about the technicality of it.
---
Clearly you forgot to take into account how reporting bugs might hurt Bethesda's egos. 
---
Bethesda is a company full of rank amateurs.  They cannot make stuff that are even remotely bug free. So the mere fact, that you dare suggest solutions to bugs is actually kinda insane. 
---
It's like making suggestions to GOD. You gotta know your place son.
---
Well 83% ‘meta’ is really high, i wonder what factors can make a character lucky. I don’t think Charisma or Luck has anything to do with it though
---
well is there a way for BGS to differentiate from people using the cheat engine to look, or ones that actually use it to modify? I mean cheating is rampant, they need to do something. NW I don’t even bother with anymore.
---
Oh yes, and it will be Star Citizen's!
---
I have seen the same thing on PC after killing a ghoul it stayed frozen in place and when i tried to loot the corpse the game did not let me view its inventory then the body teleported and started attacking again .. 
---
Also ran into a few enemies that are unkillable . 
---
This has happened a few times mostly around my camp.
---
if you get hit while sneaking you can be vats I even if your crouched. Very easy to do with an explained high powered weapon or shotgun. if you stagger then while they are sneaking you not only vats but you can negate assasins sentinel armor and kill them. In PvP I usually have to hit a bloody build one with a railway rifle and they are dead.
---
yeah we do. PvP is a lifestyle
---
Making a new engine can take years, and is very expensive. They've been running on morrowinds engine still, and I imagine they'll continue to do so. 
---
And in a sense, fallout 76 is just an incredibly complex mod of morrowind, and that's pretty awesome. And annoying, because bugs
---
Its been done before, but I dont think its likely in this situation. Imo **alot** of issues regarding server stability is just because they are way overloaded. I think their original player cap may have been a bit too ambitious. If this server cap was lowered, I do think it would be beneficial to server quality., thus improving game experiences.
---
Or you get the headless ghouls stood there and a random invisible thing slowly draining your health no matter where you run until you die a frustrated helpless death🙄
---
a new game engine will not solve anything. game engines are modules groups of code that can be tweaked and rewritten and added to at any time. a total rebuild would take literal years
---
Um...fuck Bethesda. They're annoyed you exist my dude. They'd genuinely prefer you just give them money for nothing.
---
It's time to jump ship. There's better companies out there that actually respect their base. This is an abusive relationship.
---
Gotcha. What about using another games engine? Would that not reduce the time it takes?
---
Very rare plans (fixer, bear arm and its mods, etc), flux (especially violet, hopefully at reasonable prices), .45 and Fusion Cells at 1 cap each, and rare outfits (whitespring jumpsuit, travelling leather coat, etc).
---
This is something I was praying for them to do, this game has so much potential. They definitely need to sort the current engine out... let’s only hope they do
---
Amen to that
---
Why do you want to get sick? Just the 80 points.. Do you at least get a ps4 achievement as well?  Where would I see what diseases I have left
---
Too late, am I already in trouble or should I just sell them?
---
The point is your not in combat and hiden. Its like, theres a whole  in game purpose to that do u not think?
---
I believe all of bethesda game studios games use the same engine. Skyrim, all fallouts, oblivion. I suppose they could make a deal with someone else to get their engine. Would be harder to learn and itd be a bit expensive, but nothing near what it would be to create a new one from nothing. 
---
So that may be a great idea! But I think theyll still try to keep to things they've made.. even if they are 17 years old
---
The Devs, working with a game they did not choose after being bought by Bethesda, in an engine they did not create themselves, making the engine multiplayer when it was made for single player and then being rushed by executives... have done a fuckin' miracle. 
---
The ones you want to feel bad are the ones rushing thing and making economic decisions, that is Zenimax, not Bethesda, and they will NEVER visit this place. So yeah, you might make the devs feel bad. But they pour their soul and work into this. 
---
So... yeah... great plan.
---
If you want to own an exclusive server that is active 24/7 thy would be extremely expensive. Much more than $13/mo
---
Fallout 1st is the private servers/worlds that they talked about. There isn’t something else coming. They promised to iterate on the service but there isn’t some other service coming. Fallout 1st and it’s private worlds is where mod support is going to live. They have said this multiple times. I don’t know why you are confused.
---
Would've killed a queen or 2 or 3 with u lol...
---
There are several places along rivers where you can incorporate boats into your build.  My friend has her vendor stations set up on a boat actually and it looks cool all lit up.
---
Hide in a bush
---
I wonder how much you could get actually on a boat. There must be a couple big ones out there.
---
The texture files for them were added into the game last patch so I'm certain they have to have some kind of model to show up! The concept art looks great and I would love to seem them in 3d!
---
It appears as blank so look for the all black one.
---
By purchasing the game you’ve been scammed if you’ve spent even $1 on the game you’ve been scammed
---
That’s a very good weapon.  It good for a rifleman or a commando build. Unfortunately it’s going to be level 40, not 50.
---
A new engine would be extremely expensive and take years to make. Taking everything in the current game and porting it to the new engine would take far longer.
---
The result can be easily manipulated... The survey is attached to the COOKIES on the local computer. When someone deletes the cookies, he/she can vote again.
---
It’s good gun, period. Just like an IE Handmade is one of the best Handmades.
---
Pretty sure you can get it in black hole mine, i do know for sure it's that one mine with all the radioactive barrels outside though.
---
Because its fun.
---
I like it
---
I’d much rather have it as a Combat Rifle than a Hunting Rifle.  Hunting Rifles are pretty bad in this game.
---
Why do you seek attention with a toxic Reddit post?
---
You should write them a letter.
---
Do you need to be a conduit to get it?
---
It’s been decided
---
That's why I'm not going to preorder anything from BGS anymore. I weep for TES6
---
I quit out of boredom.  The fallout 1st stuff just split the playerbase so now there's hardly enough people to do events.
---
Outer Worlds is fun, but going to have to find something else to play until cyberpunk 2077 comes out.
---
Beth has really used up all my trust and good faith, though.  I used to play 77 for hours every week.
---
I got mine out of Ash Heap from Fly Swatter
---
I pull 2k+ headshots with my instigating. It'll one-shot 90% of the enemies I come across.
---
Two-Shot is a mediocre prefix at best, but AA is one of better ones.
---
This dude is absolutely right. I can't agree more, personally. Let down for a fallout game but whatever maybe something better will come. Or maybe they'll just be finished haha. Either way this game imo was complete and utter failure, Bethesda did not pull through on this one. Infact they didn't even come close.
---
I think if you buy fallout 1st you can buy a fire volume bar in the atomic shop for 1800 atoms.
---
Yeah, but you hit just as hard with a Lever, and the lever shoots faster, reloads faster, etc.  That’s the issue with the Hunting Rifle, the Lever outclasses it in almost every way.
---
Yeah. I'd of removed that shit too.
---
&gt; All game developers do this. That’s why a lot of companies (like Bethesda) rush their games out in buggy, half-baked states. 
---
I can't remember where I first heard about it, but this mindset has become so prevalent among corporate heads that there is a term for it: minimum viable product. The truth is, most studios these days aren't aiming to ship completed games like they used to; they are aiming to ship minimal viable products. Which is corporate jargon for "Does this game *technically* run? Has it reached the bare minimum of functionality that people will blindly buy? Then ship it, and we'll drip out a few fixes over the next 6 months, then abandon it, take the money, and move on to the next thing."
---
Friends and I generally pick them up and put them into a world container or drop bag. Why?  Because they cause whatever part of the map they're in to be laggy as hell. Putting them into a bag or container alleviates this as the game is no longer tasked with keeping track and rendering of them all, they're just a quantity in a box.
---
I like how (for me, at least) the comment immediately below your rhetorical question is "Because it's fun"
---
I'm just saying that they would have to check if there is any info out there about using CE with Fo76 (ie. does it have any anti-cheat detection built in). They would do this *before* risking getting banned for using CE. It's common sense.
---
If you knew it does have it built in, then either you don't do it at all, or you could find a way to get around it (if that was possible). There is info out there, so if it does no harm, you could use that to help check your theory by running those tests, but *only* if you think its worth the risk.
---
I still like my kitted out .50cal hunting rifle. It's a shame to have a silencer on at all times cause the bang it makes without one is amazing.
---
Yes that's possible.
---
You know ESO is Bethesda also right
---
I enjoy the game I just don’t like the direction it’s going
---
It *is* fucking basic, i don't see how anyone can be ignorant to the fact that even streamers have been getting banned for "innocent" exploiting for *years*, one of the bigger recent fuckups was the WoW XP potion exploit, where you could split the stacks of them and activate each separately with no cooldown *and* increasing XP gains with each.
---
One of those would be Preacher, one who if datamining/content discussion/class research is in topic - did a shitload of that for a decade, and yet he got not only banned from WoW but also banned irl from attending a special WoW content discussion meeting between the devs and more "influential" WoW players (which, mind you, Blizzard invited him to themselves.) -[here's his story, it touches on exploiting overall as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpP344cuoq8)-
---
In general i'm noticing a weird trend where 76 players either play no other games at all, or have a severely limited understanding of todays gaming landscape - ranging from the insane whining about f1st which compared to similar premium packages in other (yes, full price) games is a damn good deal, and so far from p2w it's not even funny, or the atom shop - which compared to something like destiny 2 in recent times is a "f2b" paradise, from the atoms rolling in quite easily if one puts their mind to it, to the prices not being anything out of the ordinary (with a few exceptions such as the santa bullshit from last year, but that was misplanned rather than deliberate.)
---
In the end, exploit investigation is *not* the job of the player, and doing so is a clearly communicated risk, whining about it afterwards is cute at best.
---
Kill stuff, grind westek, Huntersville, pleasant valley ski lodge area, general steakhouse, any horde events, and big mob areas
---
Huh. Some people saying he was exploiting this bug with his friends before reporting it to Bethesda. Dunno if truth or not.
---
After these news about dupers and modders whom have been using dfferent bugs and tools for their own profit (i remind you, this is an online game and every rule violation will lead to consequences), like this guy with ultracite ammo or another guy with mod for quick lockpicking, i don't know who i should trust to.
---
P.S. What was this club about, anyway?
---
How old is the current engine?
---
fo4 was buggy af for a long time
---
Actually, pretty sure it was for data mining that there was a breachable hole in account security...
---
They were banned due to having “cheat engine” active during a logged session play time if I recall correctly
---
Which is a pretty legit tool for diagnostics these days, despite what the name implies
---
**Then** you have the blatant cheaters running rampant in NW with no repercussions 🙄
---
The Mothman cultists headpieces from the Atomic Shop many months back also function as gas masks. I discovered this while in a sundew grove and noticed that I forgot to put a “proper” gas mask one but I never got the notification of potentially getting a lung disease.
---
Being able to free up space in scrapbox for other things is amazing. Having unlimited space for scrap is great. No more screwing around like its a junk manager simulator. The tent is great for putting across map to cut costs on travelling to the far side. Emotes and stuff are fun to use. I think its just great overall. Plus i already spend like $50 a month on atoms so paying $20 a month and getting almost $20 worth of atoms with it is a huge bonus. And if you ever need a break from people you can hop in your own server. And yearly is cheaper in the end. So give it a month try and if you like it keep going :).
---
If you would have a 3* godrolled handmade with any useful additional effect as 4* in current economy it'd be worth pretty much anything. Easy a full set of armor, two godrolled weapons and one legacy.
---
Crafting cranberry juice and eating canned meat stew from Feed the people give xp bonuses. Leadership bobblehead is another one.
---
As far as pure damage numbers no. Not even my AAE lever does as much in a single shot. I would have to try an instigating lever to really know.
---
It is not a mistake. People do this so they can get logs and properly report to the developers. Actually, most companies pay people for this, they are called Bug Bounty Programs
---
I have FO76 in a nice shrinkwrapped package.  Because of my backlog and the issues at launch, I put off installing to give them time to work things out.  I'm still waiting..
---
At this point, future Bethesda releases are going to be more scrutinized before buying a shelf decoration.
---
I was a bush camper too and only played the new map maybe.. 4 times. Il have to keep this idea in mind I have aqua boy but never use it
---
There's quite a few spots where this occurs. The trailer by Vendor Bot Greg in Grafton too. Stand at the rear of the trailer, door shut, and face town.
---
I do the same. I sell almost everything at 20% of suggested price. All ballistic ammo is one cap except 5.56 which is 2 caps. 100% Fusion cores are 20% and price drops based on percentage left otherwise.
---
I hit for over 2K with my IE Lever.  The BE Lever hits even harder.
---
A 1* Instigating lever hits for 1800.
---
Little daily quests add a good bit too. Generally I'll grab my biv quest and let that go in the background while I'm killing mobs. With uny everyone has high Intel and it nets a nice bit of xp.
---
What do you expect to gain from posting this? It’s pointless and stupid.
---
Sounds like it, so much animosity
---
No, only way to ‘get in trouble’ is if people report you for having done it with video evidence, or you get auto flagged by the dupe-bot system they have in place (we’re generally talking thousands of mines for a flag)
---
Over twenty years at this point maybe closer to 25 years
---
I havent seen it..
---
\*Terminator beat intensifies.\*
---
Polygon wrote an article about us saying we are hunting no first players and hating on them. However I’m gonna try* to set the record straight.
---
1. A very small majority of the AA’s hunt non first players and they are generally regarded as toxic and most don’t approve of their methods. 
---
2. AA sorta began as a retaliation joke to people hating the fallout first subscription and the general negativity toward its customers. As with most communities on reddit, “the majority” is always right and so when people tried to defend fallout first they were bombarded with hate and worst of all... DISSAPROVAL. This caused a select few to create the apocalyptic aristocracy as a safe haven for players who use first where we could share our thoughts and discuss the game openly and freely.
---
* Try being the key word
---
Cool my build is based on throwing weapons so this is kinda a jack pot, although I still think duping is bad
---
DemonAsylum learned to not show his or his team's user names and to not show himself doing the exploits when he got perm banned. You would think other people would have learned from that
---
I thought the same when I saw it lol definitely a Deathclaw
---
You expect anything from them?  Studios go through these phases and near liquidation time, they typically stop communicating with consumers but continue releasing things as if everything's fine with little support.
---
A community manager might pop up and respond, but they'll likely have no real information so they'll have to just reiterate TOS or some rule that may or may not apply.  That job is rough at this point in a game's lifecycle even with a good studio.
---
Idk if its just me but has anyone seen a glitch where the ghouls at white spring are laying down and running at you at full speed I enjoy seeing it but is also annoying when I'm trying to legendary farm.
---
thats my weapon of choice
---
Good. Someone's learning :)
---
What's going on today? Every 5 minutes the same post
---
I'm going to disagree with you there
---
Sure it's good to have an agreement with the place you're looking at but often that's not the case, imagine trying to email beth like "Hey I want to reverse engineer fo76 that's fine right?" I'd be very surprised if they said 'sure go ahead'
---
This person heard of a bug, verified it, and reported it to beth, which is exactly what they should do  
---
Things like this happen all the time, open amazon buckets, people find them and tell the company, yet we don't see many of those companies suing these people over it, because it doesn't accomplish anything except deter white hats from working with you
---
Beth should have a bug bounty program or at the very least not ban people for verifying bugs or exploits; if no one is allowed to look at your game then only the bad actors will be looking
---
Exactly and that 'extremely expensive' server is what people what. Just like any other game with private servers lol.
---
That'll also get you banned in most places.  If your account's already banned though, no loss.
---
This sub has no sense. It's a just a game . If you like it play it if you don't like uninstall it. That's it. Simple
---
Preach just had that with 4 camps back to back while looking for legendaries. Just wish they would add an extra category thats just "Legendary Equipment" would solve the damn problem nice and quick.
---
Loot
---
Looping gunfire sounds are nothing new in large scale multiplayer worlds, ranging from games like Planetside/Battlefield to, yes, 76 (and even smaller ones but much more rarely) they all have/had a bug of that very nature, it has to do with culling and the way entity/game object states are replicated across networks, and lag, which we know 76 has plenty of during bad times.
---
So don't worry, this isn't some simple bug that bethesda is too incompetent to fix, it's one of the universal bugs that simply emerge during online play with a shitload of people/data around.
---
Haha yeah. Also happy cakeday. 🍰
---
Buy
---
I heard that there was a worldwide shortage of paragraphs. I didn't believe them until I saw this post.
---
yep you got it.
---
I never said people wanting something makes it 
---
a bad idea, I just said fallout 4 with online would be bare bones and would be just as fun/not fun as fallout 4 originally was.
---
And yea, fallout 76 could have been one of the best online multiplayer RPGs out there if bethesda tried. And as cringey as it sounds, everytime I watch the trailer for the game. I tear up because I am sad at how good the game could have been.
---
Really? Are you kidding me🤣
---
No. You get this during the enclave questline and they are always on sale in the enclave bunker.
---
Buy, find or loot. You disqualified the two best ways.
---
Yeah buy
---
Umm... The poll with posted results wasn't on survey monkey.
---
Because I like it and it's fun. You may not like it, but others do. It's really as simple as that.
---
Creation engine was released in 2011. If im correct at least some portions if the code is based off an engine initally created in 1997.
---
the drawbacks should increase with every mutation you have
---
Ok... well 1st is what you get.... it wasn’t something they had to do at all. I personally have no desire either way. Some people do like the current private mode though and are looking forward to added functionality like modding, creating rules for your world, etc.
---
To me, the biggest issue here is that they banned and refused to reply to a person who was basically doing bug research lol
---
Imagine if the engine were a building. You can use that building for many different types of businesses. It may not be big enough to be a warehouse, but that wasn't its intended function. It can be a restaurant, it can be a shop, or anything that the size allows. You can add on to the building, maybe it's a historic building and was built before electricity, so you hire an electrician to wire it up. It's not perfect by modern standards, because it was built using older standards, but It Just Works^TM. So if you wanted it to be entirely modernized, instead of just a Frankenstein's monster of old and new, you'd have to start from scratch.
---
I think they're creatures that were killed but didn't properly become corpses.
---
Yeah bloodied is crazy. I picked up a bloodied handmade and it makes all my other rifles trash. But I burn thru more ammo with the faster fire rate.
---
It's not that deep dude, it was just a fan created survey to get an idea of where the playerbase stands on Fallout 1st.
---
Why would anyone go through all that trouble to manipulate the results of an ultimately meaningless survey? Even if someone did manipulate the results, why on Earth would anyone care?
---

He payed for a service, used half of it and then asked for money back. Dumb. Then shut his site down like a child throwing a fit. Weak.
---
I have one
---
Maybe some PR department, idk.
---
Well  there isn't one as far as I know.   Out of those two methods, munitions factory is actually the worst though.  Output is pitiful and high likelihood that someone will  to try and take it from you. Even on private server I still won't use it though because the rate of production is a joke.
---
Is there proof that shows he used a cheat engine?
---
nope morrowwind came out in 2002 add 2-4 years for game development and you get 20-25 years. They are using the same engine for all their games, of course they have updated over the years  but it's still the same engine.
---
Most people dislike it, but i see your opinion I dislike the executives not the programmers who actually care. Sadly reasonable enough opinions are drowned out.  I think we need to find a community consensus on this game. Again, i do not like this game or the path bethesda is down.
---
Killing lots of high level Super Mutants will yield 5.56 and fusion cells, but not in any efficient quantities. You can do that for 10 hours straight and still not end up with anywhere close to what you’d get from grabbing lead at Lucky Hole Mine and crafting it up—which takes minutes.
---
I stopped asking why people do meaningless things awhile ago. People have and will continue to do meaningless things just to proove a point or to make something seem as though it is a way that it isnt. 
---
Some people do things just to watch the world burn. And im not trying to say thats what happened this time, just that the reasoning of 
---
&gt;why would anyone care
---
Is a flawed one. Because someone, somewhere does.
---
Modders fixed a lot of Bethesda’s old games. FO76 can’t be modded so Bethesda basically lost part of their “dev team” that they took for granted.
---
Bethesda has enjoyed long term Skyrim success on PC largely due to the mods that patch the games bugs and let you add to / alter the game. FO76 is what happens when lazy ol Bethesda can’t rely on modders to fix its bugs.
---
Yeah, I said I’d never play a bloodied character...then the Purveyor gave me a BE+250 Lever, and I never went back.  I’ll never sell both of my IE Levers though, just in case bloodied is nerfed.
---
So drawing penises is griefing now? Holy shit, people's standards in this game are awful.
---
Yeah it’s a great gun.  I just picked up a 2nd one today. 😎
---
The closest I've seen to anything like that was las tnight, I was wondering around in my NCR outfit and a couple of high levels came up and started punching me. I have no idea why else they would do that randomly and for no reason, so I assume it's because of the outfit.
---
I proceeded to just walk creepily slow down the road while they followed along punching and punching until they eventually ran away. The horror. The oppression.
---
yeah i noticed that on robots too it triggers on their head but their torso is weak right?
---
Lolz unless you are on PS4 and willing to take my soul for it, theres not much point in pointing that out XD
---
I did as well just the other day! Was so excited! The Quarry is the best place to get them.
---
I like to drop all my stable flux onto their bed and when they pick it up give them the heart emote.
---
I would like you to grief me
---
This has happened to me a few times around West-Tek, but it's not just super mutants. It is mutant hounds as well. The super mutant was naked and scratched his head occasionally, and mutant hound was panting like a dog but you can't kill them.
---
&gt; The game IS fun
---
It's a grind but it isn't fun, it is just a bad version of Fallout 4 which is just a bad version of fallout
---
Sparking people red (aka "The Wanted Game") is a longtime favorite for many.  Got a duper by the team method. Nuke mines went everywhere when I opened up on him with a BE gat plasma. 
---
I've got a friend who freely admits to being a "food build" who seems to get randomly invited to other people's teams quite frequently. They quickly learn a hard lesson about inviting strangers onto the team.
---
Mutants scrapped guns for steel, Lucky Hole lead, and plenty acid. It's simply the best way to get a large amount quickly.
---
Bug bounty. If you discover a bug/vulnerability/exploit you can get paid for reporting it, but you test it and log it so the developers can actually act on it fast.
---
Even if a company doesn't offer a bug bounty program to pay for this, it is a common practice to do it so customers of software can help the developers
---
Shadow of war had to completely redo their game economy to compensate for the removal of loot boxes in the game.
---
Introducing motives other than it being rewarding/enjoyable into game design ultimately comes at the detriment of the game.
---
Imma need about tree fiddy.
---
Yeah. You're not breaking pipes or shutting down pumps.  Breaking pipes gives 15s each iirc and shutting down pumps is 90s each.
---
Have a buddy that has the inspirational perk level three.
---
I never would have used uranium fever as a control anyway, given the three guaranteed spawns. But thanks for the info!
---
Oh. In novice mode it check points when you get in that room. So there’s whole new mechanics on standard aye?
---
I'm on Xbox and it's 500 caps
---
I like to use that one to catch people off guard. Especially when they act all high and mighty because they won't pvp you, then you kill them!
---
Thanks a lot! I already got a uny set stored (originally was to my melee alt), will have to upgrade to find the sentinel variant and see what bloodied rifle i can get with 10k caps.
---
That’s exactly what I do. One run through WestTek with Scrapper on and you’re set for steel. Acid can be a bit of a challenge, but you don’t need that much.
---
False
---

*Fewer
---
Cheers then mate.
---
I wouldn’t be a whiny little bitch if I did.
---
I think it’s called skywind or one of the other ambitious overhaul mods of skyrim
---
Good call. That's an awesome gun. I use the mutant behemoth as my measuring stick of killing enemies. Took seconds with my bloodied handmade. I'll never give up the rifle tho.
---
Also get that INT up with some tasty Mothman Omelettes, Brain Bombs and Brain Soup! Slap on a Shielded Vault-Tec Jumpsuit too.
---
Yes. It's a race against the clock to get out of the vault before you're drowned with the bugs. Breaking pipes and shutting down pumps gives you extra time. Look around for black and yellow pipes. Shoot them or "interact" with them to break them. 
---
There's 4 pump codes scattered about. If you find them, enter the code into the corresponding pump keypad. It will grant you an extra minute and a half. Knowing where they are and division of labor is crucial. 
---
Someone needs to be working on sealing up the seed vault either by hacking or gathering the seeds. Someone needs to be breaking pipes, and the other two should be working on shutting down the pumps. One stays near the pumps while the other gets the codes and relays them over team chat. Once all 4 pumps are down, these two help the others. Gaining the additional 6 minutes shutting down all the pumps provides is a major help as the extra time carries over into the next phase.
---
No, I used proper wording...
---
It's the weekend. The thirteen year olds are out of school and have some free time. They've seen all of the thousands of upvotes you can get from "DAE fallout76 isa bad gaem upvotes plz" posts and want in on those sweet, sweet imaginary internet points, and want to spend their weekend farming those rather than doing anything else with their time.
---
I was talking about world loot like junk items. If you are hunting for dumbbells for lead you have to pick up 180 items before the item you want respawns.
---
"Furries" is something that can be counted, hence 'fewer' is the appropriate term.
---
Watch Elder Scrolls VI launch without NPCs. I mean that’s no more crazy an idea than a FO game launching without NPCs pre-76.
---
Maybe this will be included with a 200$/year subscription?
---
"text chat, perk card loadouts or the ability to return to your previous server after a crash"
---
Ye, at least this one is mostly useless
---
Still fucks up the servers though -_-
---
well, hadn't heard of that before, but sure seems ridiculous without that context
---
I agree that it is against the TOS to do these things and Bethesda reserves the right to ban players who break the TOS. I just find it odd that they are taking such a hardline stance against a player that was doing a good thing. The player states that they found the bug on the forums, figured out how to replicate it, and sent this info to Bethesda. If this account is true I feel they shouldn't have been banned. I assume that Bethesda and the fo76 teams are very busy and don't have a ton of time to look into every bug on the forums and assign a team member the task of replicating the bug. This can take a lot of time and they won't be able to patch the bug before figuring out what causes it. If they really don't want players doing this a simple "hey thanks for the heads up but please do not investigate or replicate bugs or exploits in the game, as this is a bannable offense. Next time just report it to us" would have worked. If this player was attempting to benefit from this bug or exploit in any way then of course they should have been banned but they are claiming they weren't. I just don't see this scenario as a black and white were thry cheating or not. I think it would work in Bethesda's favor to clariy their stance on things like this. Stuff like this is kinda common in other game communities and it isn't punished like this.
---
&gt; Some people saying he was exploiting this bug with his friends before reporting it to Bethesda.  
---
Why use the exploit only to out yourself afterward by explaining the cheat in detail, though? There's hardly any bragging rights associated with reporting an exploit and endanger your account.
---
Plans/recipes I don't have, or amazing deals on valuable ones.
---
I am collecting one of each weapon, but only really good rolls. I also buy good, cheap weapons to resell. And I buy scrip. 
---
I buy bulk junk if I'm low. I buy stimpaks if the price is good as well as dog food. 
---
I buy 5.56 and railway spikes for 1 cap. And I but Mr. Fuzzt tokens.
---
Acid's the bane of my life haha. I never have enough!

---
Best places: Hemlock Homes workshop top left of map, 3 nodes. Abandoned Bog Town workshop for 1 node. Two workshops south Savage divide, both have one node. Monaghan Power Plant has 1 &amp; Fusion Core thingy. Tangara Town for crickets, around 60+ acid from those little buggers on one visit.
---
Sometimes you can be lucky and also get crickets spawning at Lucky Hole. Today I had ants, which is also good, for that Rad Ant Lager.
---
The full pirate costume and the jack o lantern suits seem to be the best sellers.  I have seen them on the trade sub go for 10K or so.
---
Personally no, I'm already spending £8.99 on ESO, arguably a much better online experience, and even then it's mostly for that craft bag and double banking space  
---
Plus... Nothing really great on the Atom shop, maybe once in a blue moon something great appears, like Blackbird Paint which I did buy or the bloodwashed Combat Armour which I also bought, but nothing else is really that /great/ it's okay.  
---
If they added Garden Plots though.... Maybe I'd buy it
---
Give em your money through a subscription and they maybe consider your wish. Its that simple!
---
As others have stated PA base plans and other rare plans.  I got Heavy Robot Legs the other day.  
---
I'm only missing one piece of T-45 and 2 (I think) Raider armor plans.   Have all of T-60 and 51b.
---
No Problemo. Just spendo some money-ouu on tha subscribio, yo?
---
man, you definitely seem like someone who isn't open to seeing things in another light.  but...
---
imagine someone hacked into your bank account, stole a penny to prove the security risk was their, then walked up to you and admitted to finding such a security flaw showing you where the flaw is, allowing you to make an informed decision to change banks or entrust the bank to fix the issue.  Imagine being angry and calling the police about that
---
How confident are you in reporting a bug you stumble across by accident now?  Sure, the dataminer saw the exploit through the code itself and then went in to ensure he doesn't waste their time, but had he not their's a chance somebody else will come across it eventually, by accident, and use it with malicious intent.  Or, submit a bug report and then they get banned instead.  This guy is possibly a martyr for someone now.
---
Intentions matter.  In a day and age where the players are the QA testers for new game releases, I for one would not want to run into the issue of being banned for trying to make the game better.
---
Yes but you can still use "less"
---
Definitely a good weapon!  It's likely not max level but it still should be pretty dang good.
---
No of course, because if it's not human, it's not an NPC...
---
I think something like 40 pct damage and 40 pct vats accuracy while not in "danger" could make it a pretty good sniper piece.  Heck it would even work pretty good for stealth melee.
---
Well just waiting for the real deal, that's all. It'll happen sooner or later, just might have to wait them couple years or so after they drain out the cash cow a bit more.
---
How many ranks do you need to get the glowing skeleton outfit?  I don't play NW but I might have to try it for that.
---
What do you mean "you people"?
---
Lemme just give it a try sometime and Ill let you know :P
---
They're randomly generated at the start of the instance.  Unlike nuke codes, having the codes someone else found won't do you any good. 
---
1 code is generally found around the pumps.    
---
2 are generally in the greenhouses somewhere.   
---
1 is in the seed vault, either on a console, shelf, or windowsill.
---
Since these codes are rendered objects, I would assume there's only a certain number of them for each pump, but don't know this for sure as I haven't run it enough times to see repeats, unless I just didn't notice them due to the frenzy of trying to keep the clock running.
---
Try searching Helvetia, (For the real thing, not a plan)
---
Maybe if Bethesda were tough on bugs, their games would be worth playing.
---
Never in 30 years of gaming, have i seen a company making consistently buggy shit as Bethesda.. In fact they are getting worse... Which is quite impressive.
---
I try to server hop until I get cave crickets at Lucky Hole.
---
Bloatfly syringer is best for sustainable acid production.
---
How would you go about explaining that it's stupid to ban people who help you, to a stupid person?. Is that even possible?. Or is that sort of a paradox?.
---
Yup, this happened to me when I fast traveled to someone’s camp and ended up partly in the rocks beneath the foundation. Jumped out and it went back to normal
---
The plan is sold by a vendor bot inside whitespring
---
Its an event thats up until the 12th. You just need to collect 14,000 exp points before the event ends.
---
Hitting that mine and scrapping assault rifles from west tek is very effective idk why you’d want to do any other way
---
Crafting is way easier with the Scrapper and Ammosmith perks. Otherwise your wasting your time and/or caps
---
That would give them money to pay employees to make new things.
---
White Springs, your gonna die a lot in the speed run if you go there
---
yes
---
I've played since the start and still am playing and love it, but I don't support there bad decisions like the atomic shop and subscription service. I don't like getting walked all over let alone say thankyou for doing so.
---
I got the plan from Back On The Beat last week.
---
I see that all kinds of places, not just Whitesprings. Was funny the first few times. Now it's just annoying.
---
Lock all the doors...
---
Maybe.  And maybe if they didn't ban map76 for trying to help fix bugs.  And maybe if they fixed areas and enemies not loading.  It's not a bad deal, it's just a scummy deal.
---
Is this where you can spawn them at will? I've still to try this! The Campfire Tales method seems pretty sound too, still to try that also.
---
Bugs are the biggest reason I'm back to Fallout 4 most days. At least that one has a mod I can download to fix most issues. Shouldn't have to download a mod at all for that, but I digress.
---
no?! this makes literally no sense, everyone would turn the sound off...
---
Jackpot when they do! Have you tried Tangara Town too?
---
Not sure if this is the same but I killed an enemy, it fell then literally was immediately standing again frozen. I collected my loot from a standing apparently not dead enemy. Also cam across some enemies that were alive just standing there. I then killed them and collect loot from their never falling body. This is happening everywhere on the PC version.
---
All we can do for now is speculate and it's driving me crazy
---
Listen, I say this as a longtime fan. 
---
People who still support this game and company with their $$$ have no one else to blame for their loyalty being betrayed. 
---
Bethesda has shown at every single opportunity that they don't value players, they don't know what they are doing, and all they care about is milking as much $$$ out of this flaming airship as possible before it inevitably burns away. 
---
Feel free to play the game, but please, for the love of Allah, stop supporting this company. Giving them money will not make their games better, it will only show them that they can continue to get away with their bullshit.
---
As creepy as a walking sentry bot? I saw that one time at Whitesprings and it still weirds me out. Back wheel rolled just fine. Front two were walking like it was a protectron. Honestly thought I hallucinated it at first.
---
I see. 76 had so much potential, I wish it could have used it better.
---
That would definitely weird me out...
---
Yes! I've walked straight up to some of them and had to smack them before they activated.
---
😆
---
I keep getting super mutants with one arm straight up in the air, firing his weapon from that arm. T poses, I sortuv understand, but that pose? Nope. Nada. Zilch.
---
Eat cranberry food for XP buff , sleep for buff and kil, kill ,and then kill some more ,also you can do all the new content like pioneer scouts , Nukashine and encrypted for decent XP, I’ve found the giant teacup daily was fairly easy and fast to do as well as the toxic clean up daily
---
New Vegas online seems to be currently shut down
---
Run big bend tunnel and WestTek over and over and over again. If you can get a high level friend to go first and just leech off of them for a while that’s ideal.
---
Bethesda has always been kinda shit when it comes to game development. They were doing less than stellar practices back in the Skyrim and NV days (look at how they treated obsidian).
---
Bethesda has been a money-grubbing, incompetent studio for years and it's only now that idiots are finally starting to see that its flaws were never "quirks" but rather deep-seated development and business philosophy issues that were permitted and even promoted for years by a fanbase unwilling to call out their beloved company.
---
Bethesda and Todd Howard can suck a dick and piss off
---
Rest up, eat xp gaining food stuffs
---
there’s an easy solution to that: they make it so that the sound can’t be turned all the way off, only a little bit down.
---
Sad days but you know someone u can be put in positions you have no business going into at the time of you being put there
---
Nintendo smiles upon you
---
Yeah, just have an enemy and before you kill them shoot them with a syringer that has the bloatfly barrel attached. Then just rinse and repeat until you have enough acid. 
---
Imo, the fastest way is to use a throwing weapon so you dont need to swap weapons to kill them. Its not the highest producing per minute, but is avalible until the end of time.
---
This was some advanced tactics you displayed from the onset.  We’ll skip you past bush wookie 101 and 201.  Welcome aboard!
---
Yeah, I grabbed it for the first time to check it out; very disappointed.
---
Are peope in this thread really protesting the use of CE in a non-competitive game? This boggles my mind a bit. It's not like there's actual pvp in this game and it's not like cheating can give an "unfair advantage" of some kind. Yes it's not strictly a "single player experience" but ever since (was it dead space 3?) microtransactions were added to singleplayer and gamebalance was accordingly adjusted to make the games less fun I feel like people started to get used to cheats being taken out if games. Its weird really. It's more than fair to gain any kind of resources that is possible to gain and that don't harm anyone.

This sounds like something a furry would say.
---
Take can-do and farm trash cans
---
The company itself.
---
Grab the "can do" perk at level 3 and walk through the white springs searching food containers. Trash cans for some reason count as food containers and will be the main thing to look through.

There tends to be a fair bit of it around Mama Dolce's.
---
Nah, they're probably going to ban him.
---
I just recently did this short guide for that https://youtu.be/dsnWFaf6A4I
---
Nice. Is there anything to the Legendary enemies = Legendary flies rumour?
---
"Everybody has their kinks," I tell myself before looking for brain bleach.

Also lore says they don't have genitals, so good luck with that... 😂

I'm not saying you should probably marry her, but you should probably marry her.
---
this wall of text is a mess, you want yourr point across, make some paragraphs, use the enter key..anything
---
I know, but test it to see if it crashes, maybe it's your character
---
I have 10 characters .. I mainly play with 2 across 2 XB1's ..
---
I get them fairly regularly. Be sure to wait after each spawn because they do take sometime to generate their stars. Only thing is all the legendaries will be a max of lvl 25. As the bloatflies that spawn cap at lvl 25.
---
So there is also the added bonus of a bit of script if you dont want to get them through other means. I wouldnt say its the "fastest" script farm though.
---
Why is it level 40 not 50?
---
Not unless you ask for a fridge that you can then buy for 7 dollars.
---
Sleep, inspirational perk level 3, cranberry drink and food, meat stew from feed the people event. Kill glowing ones on a private server at nuked ws and relog when you finish a run
---
I wish I could drink tea and watch tv in my shower :/
---
After you kill all the ghouls exit to main menu, join your server again and ghouls will respawn, you can do it multiple times to farm material for like 100 flux from one nuke
---
It's good, but not good enough to change your life, most definitely because Uranium Fever does not allow for items to be high level. I am guessing lvl 30-40 in your case.
---

That's better if you like the game but still want to protest. However they still get "user engagement" out of even a nonpaying player. It will read as a positive stat, as you are populating the game for the folks who don't care about bethesdas behavior nor about protesting it. 
---
If you really really like the game, then stop paying and keep playing (not many are going to drop a favorite easily). But if possible (and there are other fun games to try out) take a break, maybe drop it completely. 
---
Customer retention is a big stat, and as long as a customer is engaged they will count you as a at least a potential paying customer (especially if you've put some cash in the MTX store). So the biggest hurt happens if people stop paying AND leave, the remaining "payers" and "whales" as the industry so quaintly calls their customers, will be left with a dead game. Thus removing some of the remainder's investment into the economy, as undoubtedly some of them will enjoy encounters with players (as well as showing off the premium swag).
---
I'm very sleepy, so sorry if I don't make sense, but corp will only notice if you hit em hard in their swollen purses. Dropping engagement and player counts also scares the shareholders etc.
---
Dungeons like Arktos Pharma and the Burrows? Toxic Valley doesn't have *any* interiors besides the prison, and that doesn't scale to a high level area. Since they redid the Charleston capitol building in the Ash Heap and added the Chasm under Arktos Pharma in the Forest, at least every zone except Toxic Valley has an interior with high level enemies
---
There’s  a tree house you can build at in the mire that is pretty cool.
---
That's very interesting. So they just randomly spawn as legendary, even if you're tagging a non legendary enemy?
---
 Writing reproduction steps requires testing that the whacky behavior you just observed actually occurs. Sometimes you test it across a few different items to see if it affects a certain type/class. 
---
But you always include reproduction steps, else you're not reporting a bug, you're reporting a state you believe should not exist with no data to back your assertion.
---
Yeah they fucked up heavily with the scrap fiasco imo everyone should have the box
---
It's been going on for a while, I'm on PC. 
---
The issue is that mobs don't activate their ambush animation, leaving enemies like Ghouls, Anglers and Radroaches stuck. For the last two this makes them invulnerable. 
---
I'm sure it has been reported a billion times, somehow it is not on this list.
---
Sounds boring
---
Because the max level drop from a Uranium Fever is level 40.
---
actually you are looking at the wrong group in this case. I was also one of the people suspended for the same reason and after 13 days where i never got a human reply not even when i was unsuspended and working with the cms almost the entire time trying to get some info into what is happening, i can tell you that the customer support team is actually to blame for scenarios like this.  i made 2 replies on my original ticket to no response. made another ticket which got a canned message due to it being in the wrong queue. after replying on that the category was changed so i KNOW a human looked at it. then later it was closed as read answer provided with no answer. I then made a ticket about not being able to use my perks due to being a fallout 1st subscriber. This one was closed with no response. I called the customer support number and left a message there. the message when you call says it can take up to 48 hours to get a call back. never received one at all. finally i made another ticket this time with not only every little bit of information i had but also saying that i was going to go public about the entire thing and what i was actually looking into. this seemed to actually get traction and without ever getting a human response i received another canned email this one was unsuspending me. the customer service process should NOT be this tedious and this explains why the community managers never heard of half the things i had reported through the customer service portal. in case i didnt say it i was working with the community managers through the entire process and they even said they didnt know why there was no response as they were also receiving no responses.
---
TLDR; found a major security flaw. reported it. they "fixed" it. got suspended pending investigation. after 13 days of multiple tickets, calls to support, and working directly with community managers i got unsuspended. not once did i receive a response from a human and the cms couldnt get any responses either.
---
I saw the reviews of the beta and people on YouTube and I really wasn’t interested in this game at all but E3 free trial week I tried it and brought it played it till you drop a nuke after that lost interest in it, the other week played BFV on the free week cause same thing happened at launch for that game and it runs loads better than fallout 76 I don’t think wastlanders will revive that game it will be too late
---
That seems like a lot? Is it?
---
How can I still play? May be I’m a glutton for punishment. Or may be the game is just a game. An escape for some, a crutch for others, or whatever it is for the people logged on. The game lets you play the way you want to play it. 
---
What is it about people that don’t play and support the game, yet can’t uninstall and go one to other things? And what it is about other players getting all pissy just because I spent $13 measly dollars to see what 1st is all about? Last time I checked other players weren’t in charge of how I play the game. I’m the one in charge of that and I’ll play it any damn way I choose.
---
Did you really downvote me on your deleted post?
---
it isnt going to play itself
---
yes actually. its the same thing they do to make sure the esm isnt modified. they can run a crc check on the exe or they can even have a seperate process that checks functions to make sure they havent been tampered with. there are a lot of things they can do and its not even the reading or writing its just having it open at all that flags you. as well as other programs that someone like me uses on a daily basis for work stuff.
---
Oh I missed that part where he said where he got the weapon.  
---
Has that event always dropped levels 35/40? I only noticed recently that my stuff was always a low level.
---
finally..i know where all the fools reside so i can roast them all at once for paying for all that 76 bullshit
---
Park your camp near west tek. Hit west tek, solomons pond(for the behemoth), huntersville, generals steak house, robco, harpers ferry. Lots of super mutants and a good legendary farming route as well. Harpers sometimes will have scorched or ghouls but its mutie boys more often than not. AWOL Armaments pops off at RobCo and it's a decent amount of XP for all the robots that spawn. Also if you havent finished the quest line in Watoga it cant be a good way to farm XP just running around fighting all the robots.
---
I like leveling alts 🤷‍♂️
---
I rather enjoy it. I think I'm around 1400 hrs in and still play it daily. Tried other games and just keep coming back
---
It kinda is, i wont lie. Took me a few days. Depending how long you live and how many people you kill, you can get as high as 800 xp or as low as 20.
---
Sorry, I neglected to actually explain what was in my mind when I said I thought that might be ”too strong” and it’s only in relation to whether that effect is applied to all sneak attacks or just to the attacks while the player is hidden. 
---
I merely confused myself and thought you meant the former, rather than the latter.
---
I agree with everything that has been said, BUT this doesn't change Bethesda's attitude, nor behaviour, because the masses will continue to buy into this game and their future products. I haven't purchased anything beyond Fallout 4 and decided I will never buy Bethesda again. However, I am but one person. How many people does it take to stop buying Bethesda, before Bethesda crashes?
---
The other day, I read an Amazon review for the Fallout 76 guide book. Lots of great reviews. People say they love Fallout 76 and they will continue to purchase atoms to buy shit. Most players simply don't give enough fucks to bother to complain. Some of them even think people like us, who constructively criticize the game(s) are 'entitled little bitches'. It's odd how they get such a perspective on such things.
---
I'm happy that some people still have principles and ethics. Unfortunately, the majority doesn't and Bethesda will continue to fuck everyone over, because they can.
---
Just eat spoiled food, it weighs hardly anything, too
---
Up to level 20 or so, I do Eastern Regional Penitentiary and the Grafton Dam.  Then I move to Whitesprings, West Tek, Harper’s Ferry, while doing as many events as possible.
---
During the last double XP weekend, I went from level 1 to 123.
---
The same as any other game people simply enjoy it
---
You "can" but it would still be incorrect.
---
I server hop toxic larry's. I get around 300 acid an hour doing it.
---
Well, Harper's Ferry didn't have any interior spaces prior to the Burrows being added. Arktos was similar. Making currently unused structures into the entry for a new dungeon wouldn't be something new. 
---
The jail for example could have a hidden wing added underneath of it. The worst of the worst (gasp! communists!) could be ghoulified underneath, starving and plotting their escape while sustaining themselves on the few unlucky molerats that happens to burrow in. 
---
Perhaps a secret underground installation below NIRA full of Mr. Gutsy robots and Assaultrons protecting some pre-war secret.  Could tie this to Modus, having him be the origin of the quest and it being repetitive in some way (eg. bots damage something that routinely needs fixed).
---
Fallout Second. The same game, but with more cowbell.
---
Yes, that’s it...unless you’re below level 35.  It’s great for getting scrip though.
---
Screws always needing those, legendary weapons and armor with decent stats if it has Nocturnal in it the legendary is ruined even if its also bloodied and explosive.
---
Take hella workshops, do the retake missions, just kill everything dude
---
Excellent point, well thought out argument and it makes sense. Thanks for bringing a different perspective to the conversation.
---
Yikes. I'm not very good at NW and it would take me forever. I think it end on Tuesday too.  Thanks for answering my questions.
---
You won't get a reply from OP
---
Literally no one knows or cares that you exist, close all you want you delusional fuck.
---
This would be a nice boost, for sure. Melee would benefit less from the effect (simply on the matter that they start don’t remain in Caution for very long after attacking) but at least they wouldn’t get zero benefits.
---
On PC you can just click respawn and it works, but hitting space to respawn doesnt
---
&gt;Keep it up, and the show will be over for you as well.
---
i hear this every day lol
---
nuka nuke every furry
---
Stockholm
---
There isn't really a predictable schedule for when skins for specific weapons get released.  The shop updates every Tuesday around noon EST.  Sometimes there are new items.  Sometimes they bring back old ones.
---
Dataminers can help show what might be coming next, though.  There's a whole glut of Communist China stuff that was added in the last patch, but has yet to show up in the Shop, so chances are it will be there next week or the week after.
---
What’s a good price for serums? I get 500 from robot vendor. Obviously don’t want to charge players that much. Is 300 good?
---
Take hella workshops and do the retake missions, kill everything
---
Why do people who dislike the game post on the FO76 Reddit? Go play a game you enjoy more and post on the Reddit for that game!
---
THIS. So annoying and worst part is even if you get back in to the same server you'll miss out on loot.
---
Probably one of my most rage inducing experiences with the game so far was during the last day of Mischief Night when a 3* scorchbeast and his level 65 buddy showed up to the party. We took them out but all the sentry bots and assaultrons overwhelmed me and I got killed right as the event finished. Got back in to the server by joining a friend who was there but I couldnt get loot from any of the enemies.
---
Doesn't launching nukes on Scourge Beast Queen gets repetitive after a while? What else is there to do at endgame?
---
This is happening tonight haha. 10 glands to mod the weapon or create the ammo? Have you tried the Campfire Tails method?
---
I know YouTube says I’m supposed to play Outer Worlds, but God help me I actually enjoy this game.
---
Scabber was bundled weeks(months?) ago
---
Is the only handmade skin I’m aware of
---
And what about all those empty slave collars we find all over the prison shouldn't there be some prisoners who threw off their collars and then tried to tunnel underground or were they all kidnapped by super mutants and then turned into super mutants at West Tek who then went to the prison because it was a familiar environment?
---
Phew!  This is too far down.
---
Lolz. Lets phrase what I mean better to avoid confusion. While hidden and not in combat, Sneak Attacks deal a 100% more damage.
---
EDIT: Basicly, you keep the theme of the effect, whilst also having something useful.
---
Harper's Ferry isn't the zone, the Mire is the zone. That actually did have an interior capable of max level enemies, the Galleria even though it's Scorched. But I really like your ideas
---
I love Canned Coffee!
---
Cool, I guess I’m part of the 1%! 💰💵💰
---
I’m on xbox and I’ve had it happen at every event I’ve done damn near. It happens a lot at the queen,because of the respawn delay, encrypted, mischief night, and now awol! It sucks
---
Their really aren’t that many people playing. Look at this sub. It’s pretty much dead. The only time there’s life in here is when Bethesda does something controversial.
---
You are a hero! I'm really sorry for you about how you got treated by Bethesda.
---
Lol jeez
---
Try pressing the scroll button instead of scrolling. You've never been able to zoom out/in with the scroll button in fo76.
---
IME 300 is fair for just walking up to a random person's vending machine and hoping for the best.
---
I frequently see people selling them on LFG for 250 or below, though.  A guy was charging 150 each last night when I was on.
---
Yes. I only got the 1st membership for a month to see what it’s all about. If other members could get the tent and box by doing, say, a quest line that would have been fine by me. I don’t know if I will continue the membership for a year or not. I did love FO4 and the single player aspect makes some things a lot easier. But I haven’t decided if it’s worth the cost. I play 50% private and 50% adventure.
---
Yeah, that sucks bro, they need to fix that shit for sure
---
So funny, experience rewards in this mode are goofy. You get more for surviving then killing. Hey Beth BR stands for Battle Royale, not Bush Riding.
---
In Fallout 76, Bethesda plays YOU!
---
I too search for plans I don't know (very few left) and interesting legendary weapons I haven't tried. I sell all my known plans, magazines, bobbleheads, cores, and maps for 1 cap. Recepies and excess ammo go for 0. I keep a level 20 BOS sniper and Fixer in stock for those adventurous noobs that stop by.
