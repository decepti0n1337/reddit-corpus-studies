 Community Reward:  Bonus High SCORE Weekend – Double Dailies

---
---
Responders. Order. Heck even the Pioneer Scouts. Beth totally treats its original, flavourful content like shit.
---

---
I liken the BoS being the clapped out bongo of Fallout like Skyrim being re released every ten seconds. Rather than do something new, let's rehash shit over and over.
---
Now when I melt a SBQ when it barely spawns, I can just spam sorry emote and no one will hate me.
---
I've had zero issues.  Moved a B FFR .50 cal from one character to another and moved 15k of 556 and 45 to another.
---
I’d rather just be able to beef up the garb more, bringing it up to the level of the CSS, but perhaps with a different set of buffs, like add troubleshooters and a bigger SPECIAL boost to PER and AGI with light rad protection instead of the high rad protection and fall damage reduction the CSS boasts. I’d rather make it an outfit that viably competes with using legendary armor pieces, as the CSS does.
---
Are you on Xbox
---
If you want to find cork, just scrap golf ⛳ balls lol. Yes it sounds messed up but white springs has hundreds. Just thought I would let everyone know. 
---
I am personally boycotting this ridiculous grind, after I donated 3000 steel, for crap in return in my opinion. 
---
To each their own, I guess. I wish everyone the best on there journey through the wasteland.
---
I wish everyone left, she lands more often since people aren’t standing on the buildings/fences with one gun army. Soloing her is easy just standing in the field and letting her land
---
I feel you, I did a you’ve been insulted nite for 5k for fun and someone actually bought it lol
---
I half agree with the sentiment but the Brotherhood of Steel is central to the franchise so I'm excited they've finally arrived. However, it would be cool to have this group of vigilantes as an expanded quest set/faction where you can make your own "Superhero" to join the wasteland.
---
I already turned in my 1k, im good.
---
Yeah I agree it wasn't really babying, poor choice of words. Just felt like that. More of just a cop-out/save face by the devs. Would never have happened if they had an ounce of foresight.
---
Pc
---
100% in
---
Dude, perfect! Huge thanks for that, I never would've thought of trying syringer ammo.
---
Would you say they were left...holding the bag?
---
You mean TODD Talk... don’t let them catch you slipping again. 
---
Say 5 Hail Todd’s and buy 13 more copies of Skyrim
---
I did the same thing - it sucks but when you buy the base plans you get to put some sweet upgrades on.
---
They replied the other day that it will be fixed in Patch 22, so fingers crossed  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i4lgl1/vaulttec\_duffle\_bag\_hit\_box\_too\_small/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i4lgl1/vaulttec_duffle_bag_hit_box_too_small/)
---
I sell all of my plans in my vending machine for free for anyone that needs them, I had one person buy all of them then dropped them in a paper bug in front of the vending machine with a you’ve been insulted note. I have absolutely no idea what he meant by it but it cracked me up
---
It is somewhat worrisome how many people only seem to keep playing the game daily because they apparently feel like they *have* to, somehow. It's okay to put the game down and play something else until there's actually new content.
---
It’s a super poorly designed event. We could rally around killing scorched last year. This is just...meh
---
I’ve never even eaten a perfectly preserved pie. I’d imagine it makes you feel so dirty and selfish inside with everyone struggling to stay alive in the wasteland.
---
After it came to light that people threw away thousands of steel scrap because Bethesda didn’t put a stopping limit on the counter, I stopped. Only reason I went to drop off cork today was clearing space in my STASH to sell weapons.
---
i think i see like 1 floating camp a week. If that.
---
I actually liked the steel grind, but the concrete grind was soul crushing and demoralizing.  Steel and yes, cork can be gotten from scrapping enemy pipe weapons.   I farm super mutants at the city of Grafton, Grafton Steel, Grafton Dam and the Prison and I can get a decent amount of cork.  Grinding for concrete meant being at the mercy of random spawns for junk items.  There are certain hot spots where concrete spawns and 75 percent of the time there was no concrete there at all.    Don't tell me about hte concrete extractors. Yes I took some but farming concrete with extractors alone is painfully slow.
---
Now just need that 'middle finger' emote for people who're dicks at events
---
Nope. I am just a hoarder. 1350 hours
---
I have only one thing to say, fuck that quest, and fuck that veil.
---
Same
---
Lucky, It’s all I ever see, I have to get in Power Armour just in case the camp owner leaves the server when I’m at their vendor.
---
it’s just never enough for r/fo76
---
Honestly fuck all of it.  Fuck the worthless rewards, fuck giving up my hard earned scrap, and fuck creating an event around needing FO 1st.  It's all bull shit tbqh and I've been a FO 1st subscriber for awhile too.
---
all hail uᴉɐɥɔ  
---
before it is too late
---
Which just showcases how bullshit this event is.
---
that's not helpful.
---
When I level up next I'll record it and link it to YouTube,  when I do have the option it'll tell me to either respec or pick a perk card and when I pick the card, no point. At first I thought picking cards I already had was the problem, like I'd get bandolier or slugger and I assumed I was trading the point for a ranked up card. But when I threw a level at a card I didn't have I still didn't get the point for it.
---
[deleted]
---
yep!  its dumb.
---
They tried to remove lv 1 legendary enemies.
---
You can play it on Xbox game pass, for either pc or Xbox. It costs $1 for the first month of the pc pass. You can cancel afterwards. That's what I did.
---
Just to let you know pvp has a dmg cap and if you shot someone with a nuke I’ll do a fraction of its real dmg. Also this game dose have a problem with quantum spamming and pa Steampack spamming.
---
[removed]
---
The only time they bother me is when you fast travel to them and you end up on the side of a cliff and it’s miles above you. Otherwise it doesn’t really bother me. I quite like seeing the creativity of other players.
---
I would care about seasons if every lvl gave you atom points
---
I actually like the concept, just not the execution. The numbers are stupidly unrealistic and rewards are trash. Why not just have a random reward of say 1-10 scrip or bullion per provision? Easily makes donating a bit more worthwhile.
---
It's a 20-30 hour game per play through and its intended to be played at least twice. 60 hours isn't that short of a game. It was also made by Tim Cain and Leonard Boyarsky (Fallout 1 and 2 team members plus all their great work at Trokia before Obsidian).
---
It's Fallout in space, largely without bugs. It's worth the money.
---
I won’t be logging in daily , only during meat week . I’m nearly done the legendary run. Rank 90 , have touched the weeklies or dailies today . I want the legendary run to be over with . I may use atoms for the last three ranks .
---
so weve heard your complaints...500 atom gnomes coming soon
---
In a video game that Bethesda is trying to turn into an alternate life for people, this seems pretty ridiculous. Why does anyone have to play this game by your rules? I set my vendor prices to whatever they pop up as. I don’t care if someone jacks the prices up, because no one will buy it. Then we have people talking about raiding another players camp because you don’t like their vendor prices? Great community.
---
Now that is a really friendly and highclass way to be insulted
---
Can also confirm I've never had this happen on Xbox. Not once.
---
Really?  Took one game for me.  Just go outskirts somewhere and look at all possible containers.  You'll find locked ones.
---
Yea it’s that one thanks I didn’t expect this many people to respond
---
Just. Have to know one location. Spawn at the location, pick the lock, and leave or go Bush Wookiee. Repeat. Collect score.
---
Nice, hopefully it makes a difference. I'm sure the target will be lowered eventually so that amount should help if you donate.
---
Oh I was going to say I have fixer plan two of them I would give you one. Hopefully you get one
---
*plonks down my anti armor flamer*
---
Here... Wait is this the right place?
---
Yeah i had... a couple of them lol
---
Yeah I don’t want to ruin other ppls creativity, But I’m not seeing anything creative, I’m seeing squares connected by stairs. If it was a UFO camp then cool but that’s not what floating camps are
---
Any way to disable gore on consoles? I know a youtuber that avoids bloody mess because of youtube's rules.
---
My bad went to go do something else and came back to check turns out it was the raider pathfinder mask
---
Weird how we didn't get this, the bar didn't update at all, I think it glitched...
---
what... well for what it’s worth mine are all crane picked haha
---
Lmao!
---
Yeah! Even bolstering/vanguard is good. Less effective but it makes a newbies life easier.
---
Then get a few level 1, 3 star pipe pistols. Great gifts, they're cheap. And really help new players.
---
I might start doing that with my spare scrip.
---
The Fixer is a combat rifle variant available from the Lying Lowe(been a minute, might not be the name) quest-line. It provides buffs to stealth and movement speed while sneaking. It has good damage and has great buffs. Cheaper than most legendary weapons since it can be crafted, and fires .45 ammo which drops in larger quantities.
---
My first two camps were practically corn farms, next to a source of water. Just so I could have corn soup and not just sell most other foods that I collected.
---
A few good places for plastic have golf balls, which scraps to cork as well.
---
So if you ever need plastic hit up hemlock holes, Bolton Greens, Morgantown High, and Whitesprings.
---
&gt;but only when this npcs are inside a instance.
---
I don't think you know how the instancing works.
---
Lock pick terminals and that ping sound for legandary boxes. The two former things are always in the same places (not always accessible though). The later has a higher chance of being in the same places but not always. 
---
If you play it enough you start understanding the drop locations.
---
5 characters, closing in on 3k hours, and my total cork is &lt;3k.  That’s 1 cork an hour saved!
---
Seconded
---
leave a paper bag with spoiled meat and vegetables in Todds parking space
---
Damn I didn't even know you could rename shit in this game
---
Requiring Cork and Concrete, two of the hardest resources to grind, was just a HUGE insult!
---
I had a player kill my wife while trying to transfer stuff across. Ill admit i was stupid in doing it at a workshop, but we were alone and she couldnt fast travel. Saw the player was on a public team (bloodied build), switched my shared card to rad sponge, joined his team. He started dying so much faster then. 
---
He kicked me twice from his team before realizing and blocking me. He fied a few times while trying to move through the menus to get it done though.
---
Has shadow prime been back recently? I’ve been really trying to get it
---
Red Dead Redemption also has an amazing singleplayer campaign. Multiplayer is boring but I don't have it crashing randomly. The amount of times that I take a workshop only for it to crash before i've collected everything that I wanted is a joke.
---
Yes
---
It would need to be tied to the weapon damage as that's where the explosive damage gets it damage number.
---
Makes you take a lot more rads
---
Building in general should be less restrictive. Yet still patch the exploits and bad bugs, but don't mess with player creativity. I think we should be able to build whatever we want too; if guy wants to build floating platform OK ; if guy wants to build shack or shanty town OK ; if guy wants to build mansion OK ; if guy wants to build turret death wall OK ; if guy wants to build mountainside style diner that kills you OK. Building is one of the best parts of this game because when you enter my camp, you enter my world.
---
Thanks for the offer though!
---
I got mine from defending a workshop.
---
I have a ts 50 cal if you want it? Should help bring the pesky robots down when needed.
---
The latest patch has really fucked up the servers, I get huge lag spikes as I just explore the wastes!
---
I used to see that a lot. I don’t see it much anymore. Floating over cliff edges I see sometimes. But 1 base leading up to a whole build, not so much. I guess I’ve been lucky. 
---
I’m also guilty of doing that when I first started. Maybe you’ve just ended up around some new players and they’re going through that phase of FO infancy?
---
Vendors sell cork. Not in the same amounts that they sell concrete or other junk but I got 250 cork by jumping around vendors.
---
While more Atoms would be appreciated, this kind of post just proves people haven't explored what's in the actual packs, just glancing at the outside of the box basically. You end up with about 2000 Atoms from getting from rank 1 to 100. However, the amount of time you put in to get that is woefully unrewarded.
---
as the old saying goes..
---
ya cant fix stupid...
---
Damned if they do, damed if they don't.
---
What works for me is I found an area that I liked spawning in, and I spent a few games just exploring it looking for every single container that could be lockpicked and terminal that could be hacked, and then would run straight to them as soon as I spawned 
---
You get the best weapons from hacking terminals, but locked containers have the advantage of possibly including high level armors so it depends on your build and preference, I always go for hacking because I'm a heavy weapon, power armor using build, so armor doesn't help me
---
After you learn one area, do the same with another, and so on and so on
---
Eventually you'll be able to spawn wherever your team decides, and be able to find loot pretty quick
---
I put 38 in my shops for 0 caps.
---
Weight - 
---
True hiker and travelling pharmacy are essentials.  Then when you unlock the chemist or grocers backpack.  You can free up 3 special points.
---
Mutations -
---
Starched genes level 2 and class freak.  Starched genes enables you to keep mutations without radaway curing them.  Class freak helps with the negative effects of mutations.  These perks are over level 30 iirc.
---
Damage -
---
Depends on your build.  Max out weapon specific cards.  Add in bonus damage perks like bloody mess or tenderizer.  Each to their own.
---
That quack outfit is fucking COOL
---
Turns out it was the pathfinder mask from the raider bundle. It’s a shame it costs money. If you know any alternatives to that mask I’m open ears all I need is a respirator to complete my character’s cosmetics
---
this is a bug with the future-tec camp skin. i don't know if there is a way to fix it without replacing your camp
---
Thanks I'll check it out!
---
So do you suggest furious + explosive is a flawed combination? I have a berserker so I understand flawed combos such as zerk + DR while aiming = bad.
---
if you dont need it I'll gladly take it.
---
Naw but I do wish I had picked that up in the atomic shop it goes great with scout masks
---
I agree, But a rule like gravity having a effect on a camp in a game where floating buildings would be odd if the developers starting building them, Is that really a harsh thing? Maybe
---
I LOVE the OoM so much!
---
Those lvl 1 uny wood armors are usually WWR and were floating around in player vendors for a while.  Most certainly all duped but who cares tbh. Great gear for leveling up.
---
Hopefully you had a spare card....
---
Pvping a person in a PvP area doesn't make them have a small peen. I agree PvP is 76 is beyond jacked up. Always has been and has changed from shit to polished shit. But it's he way the game is designed. One of those don't hate the players hate the game thing.
---
As others said, there's little point to them except to finish the dailies/weeklies. I used to take the lakeside one for lead way back in the day and then I discovered lucky hole mine. What a difference that made.
---
by boner you mean shit?
---
Of course. I just havent been able to trade it out, and sounds like you coukd use it more than me.
---
Can confirm guns and bullets 5 does not give extra cork either.
---
I think it's minus 60 points to your rad resistance when you're using it.
---
Naw but if you happen to have a scout mask I’ll pay a pretty penny for it
---
I'd love to pay a visit to your shop 😁
---
That's great advice, thank you!
---
If the addictols are all looted, you can make an omelette from a radscorpion egg. It will cure a random addiction when comsumed. I often find radscorpions near one of the farms in the Toxic Wastes up north.
---
Good to hear
---
Inspect any weapon or armor, choose to rename. Doesn’t even require a workbench. 
---
You don’t get as many characters in renaming as you had with the Bethesda-given name. 
---
You can only have around 50 renamed items at any time.
---
It’s a reward with risk keeping the workshop
---
Bet you're fun at parties.
---
Not really.  Just create a fun event with realistic expectations.  Forcing a minimum of 250 per is stupid and forcing a max in the hundreds of millions is beyond tone def for how their game works.
---
You can create this same event and no one would complaun but they fucked up.
---
I just imagine them attempting to fix it and breaking it, taking awhile to fix it. I'd love for them to fix it. I have a f/e/15fr fixer collecting dust.
---
 I know nothing about coding, but I can't see why they wouldn't be able to fix it.
---
It was the pathfinder but the flyboy is a good alternative
---
I could be wrong, but I think it is Fallout76Custom.ini
---
then sure, what's your gamertag?
---
This char only has 1 END so I don't think I can take the hit.
---
Agreed but it wouldn't have been so poorly received if they had just asked for reasonable amounts.  200 million cork?  Thats absurd and we all knew that from the start.
---
I think it was recently cleared, someone must have been using the ammo converter, lol. But you are welcome by to pick up anything you need any time.   
---
Also, if you need ammo specific in type, just write me and I can help you out.
---
I think I have like 10 or 12, but I think 10k of that was from the fallout 1st stash wipe thing....when they reimbursed us there was insane amounts of the common scrap
---
I play on PS4 &amp; majority of camps are floating, Mist newbies tend to build shacks bear the river in Flatwoods, I don’t ever get to see anything special or creative with camps &amp; it’s surprisingly considering all the Atom shop camp stuff.
---
One of the most posted about issues on here
---
Thank you appreciate it
---
Thats not sustainable long term.  Caps are finite too.
---
Do you know if a mirv fatman gets around this? Since it splits into multiple mini-mininukes before exploding
---
YES! But sadly it cost money and I’m not that addicted to 76
---
Narmyknight, I may be able to jump on for a few to give it to you, but if not I can definitely be on in 2 hours.
---
burn it
---
It's the Fallout 76 Reddit, no one is going to parties here.
---
You get cork for scrapping pipe weapons, but no cork is required to make them. Hint hint.
---
Am I the host?
---
I guess it's more midcentury american slang but yeah shit could be an synonym. see [sense 2](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/boner). Compare with [sense 3b](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shit) of shit.
---
I don't group that often and lately only for the gains with the new grouping system.  
---
I also have some mobility issues when gaming so I don't go for grouping, certainly not PVP, and b/c I know how most people are when someone isn't performing to a group standard every time.
---
Both backpack mods you can get from the raiders and settlers don't have any negative effects that is why even though they cost gold bullion they are the best
---
I mean, then then why are you complaining if you're aware your own weapons are shit? lol
---
If it's asking you to respec or pick a perk card, that means you're already past level 50. You don't gain special points past level 50, just the ability to move them or gain more card options.
---
No Mutants allowed &amp; also no ghouls or ppl named Homer!
---
One shots all legendaries at Uranium Fever. *I’m sorry* emote.
---
I would say to not even try with the fat man, it’s ammo it 6 lbs and it has the worst hit regs. I would say for pvp have a fast shooting fun that dose 100 or so dmg per hit.
---
Caps are infinite. They are constantly generated in loot drops, event and daily rewards and potential sales from NPC vendors were you get at least 1300 a day and the cost of buying bulk is well below that.
---
Perks/Mutations... lowbies ussually dont share any perks, the aim is for higher levels who are alittle more versed on how charisma perks work. Well for me anyways
---
If you have the option to respec, you are past level 50.  You don't get any more points after 50, you can only move the ones that you have around.
---
oh it's alright, you're giving it to me for free so its definitely going to by your time preference.
---
I see where you are coming from, however people building floating platforms are using simple building mechanics:
---
Foundation &gt; stair &gt; floor.
---
If it was any more complicated then you would have to use a lot more budget to do basic building, also you probably wouldn't be able to edit a structure as efficiently once it's already been built.
---
One of the other best parts of this game is the diverse community and player base. Some just don't want to build something crazy cool, they just want a place to stash/sell their stuff and fix their gear. Others end game is building. And there's a ton more in between.
---
I can share after I complete the challenge. My two year old won’t go to sleep so I haven’t been able to get on.
---
Edit: i logged on and was going to share after completing challenge in NW but the slew of downvoted made me change my mind. Good luck everyone.
---
Shoot me a message on xbox and ill try to get on.
---
Damn. That’s sucks. I play PS4 too and saw a gorgeous camp today built in such a way that it had a waterfall cascading through one of its rooms. I was very jealous.
---
I’m on a search to recreate the ranger as cheaply as possible I was planing on wearing goggles and an army Helmet with it then I had the hunters long too it was a good idea In my mind but sadly the pathfinder costs money
---
Ditto
---
Thanks. I appreciate that 👍 I am always in need of .38, lol. I am on Xbox btw. You?
---
&gt; Not really.  Just create a fun event with realistic expectations.   Forcing a minimum of 250 per is stupid and forcing a max in the hundreds  of millions is beyond tone def for how their game works. 
---
And yet NPC vendors sell bulk of just about every junk there is. Which allows you to easily buy the resources each day.  Considering that caps rain down like water getting free caps per enemy killed, as rewards for dailies and events as well as the NPC vendor of 1.3k a day for selling shit. You can easily get enough to buy scrap with very little effort.
---
That’s your problem. You are over level 50. You don’t get any more points, you need to respec if you want to increase those special stats
---
Same, gt is narmyknight
---
I wish. The server shut down soon after and I lost all that info.
---
.
---
At least this is a chance, however faint.
---
Been waiting for blood eagle apparel for months now! and so happy they finally added the sorry emote.
---
No
---
ffs really? And how much cork needs to be donated?
---
Embrace it
---
Yeah I think you’re right &amp; have put it into perspective for me. Cheers
---
I ended up sending money too, these are just too good to pass up
---
You can only hold 30k and only make 1400 per day.  Spending money on cork to literally five away isn't sustainable.
---
I love that damn dam.
---
At least they woke up on the concrete. Though I'm sure it'd need to be even lower for Cork, the average player isn't going to know how to farm that lol
---
Meaningless drops in the bucket.  1.4k of bulked cork isn't even a percent of a percent of what they're looking for here.
---
You get to know where big crates tend to spawn, also terminals
---
Thanks. Mine is 'Ghost Dog'. See you in game shortly  👍
---
Wow that’s pretty creative, I like doing home stuff like doors that open to a wall with the classic Fallout 3 “F off” lol
---
I believe atoms don’t transfer
---
*Let’s give a huge round of applause for your post-apocalyptic host with the most (mutations that is!) the one, the only...*. ***DarkSpaceZoo123!!!***
---
Correct
---
Indeed it is
---
Atoms don’t transfer between launchers
---
*joke stuff, Autocorrect is killing me
---
250 cork costs like 300 caps. Last I checked that is well below the 1.4k per day limit.
---
On top of that when you buy things from vendors a portion of your caps goes back into their inventory.  Allowing you to sell more to them and reduce your losses even more.
---
Furious used to be busted and not work at all, no matter the combination. Since it's been fixed we have seen "magic" weapons appear across multiple weapon categories that some say are related to furious damage.
---
I don't know much about coding either, but I do think there has to been something deep down that can be done to save/fix weapons. It could simply be a conflicting command or line of code in the wrong order messing things up. It could also be something else miner such as how or in which order to load files  from the system/server.
---
I've been playing since launch and aside from golf balls and pipe rifles I dont know how to farm it!  I've got about 1800 across 2 characters that are lvl 250 and 400...  thats such an asinine amount of cork!
---
Oh shoot that's a shame oh well thanks a lot for the help and answers
---
That’s good to know then, I’ll pick it up on the next discount
---
I’m on PlayStation unfortunately
---
any way to request them back into my account, its the same account that i was using on xbox game pass.
---
Just like COD points across different versions of Warzone. They don't carry over to any other consoles/launchers.
---
Killing scorched was fun because killing scorched is fun.  Donating to a building drive is not.
---
No problem! Also in case you weren't aware, you can open your pip-boy and set up a camp inside of NW 
---
It claims a fairly huge area, and you'll be the only one able to build inside it, meaning if you claim the area that you think may be the final circle area, you'll be the only one able to build, preventing enemies from possibly fortifying themselves
---
You also can build stairs to areas that are hard for others to see, really good for hiding or doing an ambush, once you climb up, you can place a new camp down, and it will despawn the stairs
---
Hilariously, you also can instantly spawn any saved blueprints you've made in adventure mode 
---
I took over a workshop in adventure mode and just built tons of different little forts and handy building presets for different situations and saved them as blueprints.
---
If I'm feeling bored sometimes I'll build a big floating base or platform over a cliff with added fortifications like the concrete defence walls and stuff, and then I'll hide under it or somewhere I can keep an eye on it
---
Enemy players usually see it and fire at it, giving away their position 
---
Hilariously sometimes they assume that it's been abandoned, and they'll try and jump on it to use it, if that happens I'll despawn the base by moving my camp and they'll die to fall damage lmao 
---
I've whiped whole squads doing that, it's so funny
---
No minimum level requirement.
---
And yet if everyone bought just 500 cork and donated it you would reach the goal.
---
Don’t know but it’s bright if in first person so I love it but third person nothing but that’s how my bright excavator is also
---
That’s why I said “come back when you are ready to fight,” if you don’t like getting one shot, fix the issue. Get perks to block damage, build an armor set, find a good PvP weapon. Don’t come to Reddit and cry that the big meanie has a better pew pew machine than you.
---
It would be too constant at the beginning. They would probably have to give a small amount (like 5) for every level that way the entire run will give 500 + the 1,500 atoms and the bonus 500 for completing the run. That way you get 2500 for completing the run. Or have a repeating loop at the end that gives scrap, repair, lunchboxes, and atoms so that way score is still useful.
---
Are you gonna make and scrap a million pipe weapons?  I'm not trying to troll here but is the rewards worth that to use your game time that way?
---
It’s the looking for group(LFG) system built into Xbox Live. I forget where it is since they changed the menu around.
---
There very little reason for even doing a private team any more. Just start up a new public team, have your friends join and then if there are extra slots enjoy the extra bonuses or kick them out. No one can mess with your base and you get that sweet bonus XP.
---
The platform owners have their own funding setups, they take a cut.
---
Oh right, I know what you mean I think, I used to be in rocket league trading ones a couple years back
---
I'm mostly going for fun factor, plus I feel like it has the advantage of blinding the opponent in the middle of all those nukes, plus all the camera shaking making it hard for them to line a shot, assuming vats is still broke lol
---
I've been running the explosive weight reduction perk ever since I picked up my Junkies fatman, mininukes only weigh like .6 lbs for me atm 
---
I'm carrying like 30 of them on my dude right now haha
---
They will for battle pass 2 and 3 (if the game is still online by then) and so on.
---
No bug is too big or gamebreaking to be ignored by this team.
---
Pssst scout mask and medical goggles looks badass together. Way better than ranger.
---
They were like 2-3 weeks ago but only for first.
---
queen is currently immune to being crippled so limb damage is useless against queen it doesn't actually do more damage it only increases cripple chance EDIT actually limb damage minigun can be a magic weapon so it's not that useless
---
Cool.  So I can buy 1k cork each day for 1200 caps.  They want 200 million.  Thats .000005 of our goal....  thats an insurmountable amount of caps to spend to reach this goal.
---
oh, supposed to be like 200,000,000 but they probably will lower it?
---
The response will be to spend the Atoms on the original platform. The purchase carry over, but not the currency.
---
What a waste of ammo. A 1\* wood leg? That is the biggest thing i hate about this game, the legendary drops...
---
They also charge for updates and patches you push out etc. That's why PTS is Beth launcher only
---
The best you can do, is launch from xbox game pass, spend the atoms, then whatever you bought will be available on steam.
---
its the meat piles.  Any event that generates a ton of meat piles are dropping FPS in big ways.   
---
Devann knows and they are working on it
---
They better not take over existing locations, even more reason to kill them all
---
It was umm, my first time.
---
You're insane
---
Oh, so you’re just one of the big brain players who think taking the risk of sitting at 20% health shouldn’t have any benefit. Gotcha. Thanks for clearing up any confusion.
---
Happens with the flyboy outfit too.
---
Every estimate I see of live players is about 30k.  Thats 370k less than you need if everyone donated 500...
---
Underwealming drop yes.
---
Fatman and broadsider are literally huge disappointments.
---
Hope not, my camp is in the river bed/valley just south of the damn dam :-)
---
Many of those are already shelf variants in the camp menu. All of those should be able to display things too, though.
---
So I guess you assume that you are the only player?  At 1k cork donated you only need 200k players to donate that once to reach the goal.
---
I was wondering suggested level
---
cant sadly, cancelled my xbox game pass and uninstalled 76 after steam was done. i sent a support ticket to Bethesda.
---
To join in FO1 you had to get a holotape log from the Glow.  They thought they were sending you to your death.
---
Yeah, just post “LTB non legendary Fixer for leveling, PM price” and pick what you want to pay. I wouldn’t pay 300 caps, but you can see if someone could also throw in ammo for a better deal
---
idk.
---
This will be "fixed" in patch 22.
---
By which I mean you'll be able to finally purchase the plans, but only for deep-pocketed, not any of the legion of other missing ones. The big caveat is that it won't show up in the mod menu. "We'll let the dev team know!"
---
Patch 23... they'll fix the fix, but this time it will be appliable but do nothing.
---
Patch 24... maybe?
---
You get 500 for getting the last one.
---
Even if it were as little as 5 per lvl, it would be so much better than what it is now (I think it’s around 20-50 atom iirc, I might be wrong since I haven’t played since the 3rd week of this season)
---
And were is the source of that estimate?
---
If you’re on pc the save everything mod is a must. Just favorite the item and you have no fear of accidentally losing it ever again, unless Todd yoinks it from your inventory
---
You did great! I wasn't knocking you, just that when you solo a 3* wendigo colossus I expect 3* loot
---
True. Just saw that. Btw, that bundle looks cool.
---
Yeah the magic weapons, it’s better than be Gatling plasma
---
since the shit  BoS event I don't even care anymore, just logged in to see if is playable and waiting for one wasteland to drop so I can decide if the game goes to the bin or not.
---
30k average live player base is what I keep coming up with.  And how many care about a banner?  How many know about the event?  How many care about the legendary run?  Its a tone def goal...  they don't get their player base and their goal here showcases this.
---
The event itself is lazy and bullshit.
---
Don't do it.
---
Are you in the workshop running around out of stealth? If you are, you're a huge target. That's why people keep showing up and melting you.
---
High concentrations of ash/meat piles are a killer.  So, Radiation Rumble and Line in the Sand are notorious.  I don't know if it's the latest patch and/or servers but I'm on PS4 so it's not my hardware that's causing it.
---
Flyboy outfit has a light on the chest of the outfit.
---
IIRC, that’s an old number from Steam, and ignores the console players and all the non-Steam PC users.
---
Useful information, but what is CHALLENGING about it? Most of the challenges are just simple things you would already be doing as a high enough level for this to be an issue, but this ends up being a terrible solution to a problem that doesn't even need to exist.
---
They should take away the big lump sum tiles for atoms and just award like 20 atoms a level or whatever the number is flexible. So you get little bits of atoms per level in addition to the frames or skins or whatever rewards.
---
Then have rank 100 repeat as many times as you want, and you get atoms each time redo 100.
---
I lost my veil so I can’t ever enter that place again. Fuck it.
---
Guess you never did the Christmas scorch event.
---
I was getting tons of 3* lvl1 weapons from the jingly jangly scorch in certain areas of the map.
---
Yeah I might give it a try tomorrow, thanks for the help mate
---
Yep.  Got it from Google but Beth doesn't share this shit so its what we got...
---
I bow before uᴉɐɥɔ
---
No problem! Good luck out there.
---
I know they know...I stated that if you’d read it, but they also know about a lot of bugs and do shit all about it and plenty of people also wouldn’t know. And I hope it lets anyone know that may not have.
---
It’s outdated. There are far more players than that. 
---
But that’s not the main issue here.
---
A good way to raise the raider rep is by going to the quarry X3 in cranberry bog &amp; killing the muirelurk queen &amp; taking the meat to the river adventures place near the kanawh cemetery
---
Lazy? Bullshit?!?! What is this, a Bethesda game or somethi-
---
Your friend is being very dramatic. The reason there’s hardly any PvP is because it’s pointless. You get a few caps and some junk at best for killing someone. 
---
They also have to shoot back which makes it more of a duel than open world PvP. There’s no full loot or raiding possible either. You can’t actually get into someone’s stash as you would in Ark or Rust. It’s a PVE game with some multiplayer elements.
---
Problem is My boyfriend and I are only two people. They wouldn’t care about losing to $22 subs but really feels like they don’t give a shit in general about their entire game base.
---
Thank you for the tip!
---
(Known)Plan: Dutch Tahiti Mangos
---
Maybe PC has a stable market, the xbox is like some kinda open air flea market, get in where ya fit in. I make a nice daily 10 to 12k caps cuz its so disorganized.
---
Raider Punk as an ally, he sends me after a Flatwood about once a week on his daily quest, other than that I have only encountered them in the middle of nowhere in The Mire and near Sugar Grove.
---
That Goat Totem looks shiny and chrome! It's strange it's not part of the Blood Eagle bundle along with the Quack Outfit.
---
My experience from the old survival server is that vanguard armour &amp; executioner weapons that do more damage when the enemy is below 50 health combined with chems can really make it painful for bloodied builds to troll u.
---
I use ???
---
Stop taking workshops and volunteering for PvP and you’ll start meeting nicer people.
---
No I realize that.  Haha.  It was fun but absolutely a three star should drop.   It was actually a but comical.
---
I can't speak for ps4 (I'm on PC), but I can say that I don't do anything creative because of the extreamly restrictive placement options, small budget, and the camp being destroyed if I ever need to move it.
---
If I want to build fun creative buildings I do that in FO4. In 76 there is just no reason to spend hours fighting the system to make a half way decent looking base only to have to scrap it all if I ever wind up moving camp (the blueprint things just never work right for me to rebuild with and unless the terrain is a perfect match your old building won't fit in the new spot anyways).
---
Respect for those that make the great bases, but I'll stick to my box with turrets on the roof.
---
I don’t know of any other way to raise the settler rep outside of the daily quest unfortunately. Maybe someone who sees this will enlighten us.
---
I’m level 100 and still use the house a random teammate built for me when I was like level 10! It’s nicer than what I could make, plus I have fond memories of the kind stranger that helped me out that day. Good stuff!
---
Source of that number?
---
Google.
---
What is the carry capacity on those?
---
Sounds about right. Out of date. Only comes from a single source. And isn't indicative of the entire player base taking all groups into consideration.
---
I never thought I’d say it but fallout 76 has kept me engaged longer than previous fallouts. I think once you start playing multiplayer games you realise there isn’t a better alternative for real people interactions. You are “seen” and your camp, weapons, armor, loot and character become more relevant and feel like they actually exist. NPCs say and do the same tired lines from day 1 and you know that they don’t actually “see” you.
---
I stayed on whole refresh, not a single auto complete and didnt have one yet, never touched nw, I know it dont matter but I'm just saying
---
I play every day same gt as here and I sell all my plans for 1 cap each same gt as here
---
herbivore is way better for a rifle build than carnivore
---
And bethesda forces people to goto workshops.
---
Bethesda is basically forcing PVP onto people who want nothing to do with PVP.
---
Ultimately, Bethesda is at fault.
---
Any Combat Rifle or Combat Shotgun plans?
---
Ive seen people display their military certificate/papers on the bottom shelf of that display and it looks good. I think you get a commendation medal or something too for the enclave quests but I dont know if its able to be displayed. You could also put army helmets or the civil war hats in it, specially alongside the black powder pistol. I like the look of the blasting caps box although its probably more mining related
---
Well, you could borrow a copy or rent one from Redbox. But that would probably eat up about half that $3 value you lost.
---
Not at all. Just sharing some info
---
it's both mate, incompetence and malice, those devs don't know how theyr game works or how MMOs works they are incompetent.
---
Thanks!
---
Okay was just wondering...like I was bored today making 60 ammo.
---
The single best sign that someone is using bullshit logic is when they refuse to provide their source when asked. Thank you for letting me know I shouldn't take you seriously at all.
---
No? There may be some optional objectives around it, but it’s not forced in any way.
---
I agree wholeheartedly.the whole questline was great and spread out acroos the map you a real chance to see Appalachia
---
Damn now I miss building in 4. Screwing around with the contraptions and such.

It was one of my favourite quest lines in the game.
---
I’m just salty that the gear you got from it was kind of sucky.
---
I’d love to build a MoM build
---
Colossal is all server side fixes at this point. All the client or install data is in place ready to go they just have to push the button and set it active on servers.
---
It’s great that you are crusading so adamantly for a major issue that all players in the game can agree is a top priority over this other minor bugs like broken perk cards and mutations. I wonder if Bethesda knows how when I see a floating camp I am forced to hard quit the game in sheer disgust. This is something that all players should be rioting about. No more creativity. No more interesting building. Plain houses for all!
---
i think something better would just be to finally allow persistent workshops on fo1st privates like they said they would
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
then on your private you could build whatever you want in the workshops and have it load back in, next time you are in your private. it costs no extra server load than if you just build it every time you log in or if people built in a public
---
Bowling pins, baseballs, lightweight armor, and golf clubs of you have scrapper equipped. I used to have so much of this before I had a scrap box, because in my endless pursuit of plastic, I would sever hop Morgantown hs,  Bolton greens, whitespring, and freak show.
---
Yoooo I just said this a couple of weeks ago. A raider scrap box would be sweet, or any faction style scrap boxes at that. Alternatively a smaller sized or different shaped scrap box would be a welcome addition as well.
---
So I bought fallout 4 and never played any fallouts before that. But I bought when I bought my Xbox one and it came with game of the year fallout 3. So I played and beat 4 then beat 3. Put the game down until like 4 months and I was reading random reviews of how long fallout 4 was and I was like damn I must’ve skipped so much. Being I only put like 50 hours in, so I got back into it right around the time far harbor was coming out. I truly fell in love with the game and put probably 400 some hours in it. Went back to 3 put a bunch in that and then went out and bought new Vegas on a ps3 which I also bought just to play. After I bought all that new Vegas became backwards compatible on Xbox which was so amazing being on ps3 it would randomly glitch. I loved that game also. So when fallout 76 was coming out I bought it played during beta and beat the main story. Put it down for about 6 months and picked it back up and haven’t been able to put it down. I am now at 800 hours in 76 and can’t wait to see what this game has in store. So I feel what you’re saying but they’re all amazing to me.
---
How dare fallout shacks not imitate real life. http://curious-places.blogspot.com/2011/11/floating-house-krasnosilka-ukraine.html?m=1
---
I just always sell for cheap, because that's what I would buy. I'm not going to spend full price or over
---
It's an easy one though
---
nah but I do have interesting ones, extra deathclaw gauntlet finger, Santa crash, that kinda stuff
---
As a newer player I would always welcome more plans if it’s ok! I’m on Xbox
---
oof
---
There will be next week.
---
Except when you’re bloody build and some dude on your team shows up to the same event and poofs all your rads away. Quick boot from team from me in that case.
---
Honestly, please keep it as is. I keep it as my death bag so folks in Nuclear winter, and Adventure have more trouble jacking my st00f.
---
All you'd lose out on is strange in numbers which, while powerful for only 1 perk point, isn't required. You could also just join a team but not actually do group activities.
---
Lastly, herd mentality works if you're in a team, even if you're by yourself.
---
Also I recommend herbavore over carnivore. Carnivore means never having to worry about food but some of the best food buffs are veggies.
---
Lol I stand corrected.
---
They should add more atoms to season two. We don’t need the same power armor skin and ghillie skins or 10 gold bullion
---
More lunch boxes, repair kits, scrap kits.
---
oh yeah for sure! come by my house by the Wayward and I'll hook you up. GT: LoneWanderer#869
---
Thanks for that one, i read it in my mind same way they did in OW =)
---
I lost around 1200
---
Flamethrower trick
---
Yes.
---
Yeah do you know why this is happening it seems like the new emote i assume broke the game or when they changed the concrete
---
Amazing isn’t it
---
that's cool, if you want any plans we can trade, GT is LoneWanderer#869
---
I think it’s because it once had some armor effects. But like some helmets that also had effects, they removed it. 
---
So the wiki also still says it has negatives. But I haven’t seen any negatives on my own character. I bought the mod just recently myself.
---
no ide What that is but I do not have it
---
90 chems and 90 food and drink does not stack with perks and has no negative effects so they are the best
---
So sorry for you guys, I've never experienced autocomplition bug but it has to be really frustrating and demotivating =(
---
Ohhhh last time I heard it was only 4
---
Completely restart game. If that doesn’t work then 
---
&gt;	its not a big deal to me as i can get it back from trading
---
If you lost them that sucks. But, like you said, Caps are easy to obtain.  In a few days you probably won’t notice that they were missing.
---
Crops will grow the same rate in any type of dirt.
---
I just gave you my source.  Its the only one we have available.  Not that it will matter because you're utterly ridiculous but here you go:
---
https://steamcharts.com/app/1151340
---
If your on PS4 I can hook you up
---
Yeah i just hope it dosent happen to people who grind and have like 10k it would suck
---
Isn’t it linked to whatever the accuracy is.? I have a tse combat with like a 20 accuracy, and I have a aae pump with a 70 with the mods I’ve chosen.
---
I think I've still got some in my vendor, ill just go on &amp; check
---
Bruh... Did you read his post or not?  He says Xbox.
---
Damn, did we not make it? I checked in the morning before work and I thought we were close.  
---
Cork is going to fail even moreso than concrete. Why the F does the BoS need so much cork??
---
Lol that's fantastic, food for thought....
---
You actually have to move your camp after deselecting the skin. That solves it for good.
---
Do you think it could be character corruption?
---
Not a mod - duped christmas presents.
---
Thanks. I've been transferring items quite a bit lately. I've got an unlearned BOS T-60 Initiate paint plan I'd hate to lose because of this.
---
I made a post, if that’s “crusading” okay then, Ignoring the perk cards &amp; mutations &amp; other bugs because Bethesda fixed a wall glitch &amp; ppl want that to take precedence is counter to what you’re saying, I get a audio bug every time I log on but that’s less important, Again I made a post, Not a demand, So why the negativity.
---
So were is Xbox, PS4 and non Steam PC players?
---
Im extremely nice, until the weekly challenges says to capture 3 workshops and will try take an empty one however if a level 20 decides to build a floating wooden palace at the abandoned bog, imma go head and take that monstrocity of ya hands.
---
I think his comment was in response to the private world solving the issue.
---
I put digested goo on mine!
---
Didn’t hear about that, still though I don’t think we can do that in time
---
Nuclear Winter drops a huge NW duffel bag. Also if people are stealing your stoof, they are gonna steal it anyway. Your not gonna spawn back quick enough to retrieve it.
---
Okay, just know I only have 3,500 caps
---
Oh so he duped Christmas presents and now I lost hundreds hours of farming because of a duper?
---
Yes, couldn’t agree more!
---
Secret service
---
Title made me lol
---
I played it on gamepass and it $1 was still too expensive. jk it's not that bad but i wouldn't recommend it. Very short, horrible visuals, very bad gunplay and minuscule dead worlds.
---
Cool thanks! I’m technically “working” (from home) right now so I’ll just pop on but then I’ll have to get back to work lol
---
People sell the plans.  Save up around 10k caps and search a marketplace sub or discord for one to buy.
---
How so?
---
Or just don’t play either and enjoy your life playin good games.
---
Try one of the other subs. This one doesn’t allow bartering.
---
There in my vendor for 350 caps each gt aussiex01
---
Thank god, I was actually looking forward to the banner and I thought we hadn’t gotten it cause I hadn’t heard about the amount being dropped
---
I tried the Enclave commendation but it clips entirely into the shelf. I was really disappointed. Blasting caps box is a good idea, that and a box of syringer ammo will probably go together nicely.
---
Yes. Bloodied builds have no benefit. None. Zero. That is why many people choose not to play bloodied as theres no benefit. Those foolish people I see who are  bloodied are doing it and getting no benefits. Absolute madness.
---
How does duping presents get him instant money?
---
I really haven’t been on reddit in awhile, and I actually just got back into fallout, I thought maybe the most military based faction in the game would give you something worth your 2 hour grind
---
There is also one in a hidden cave in lucky hole mine
---
There’s not much you can do, except adapt in the future.
---
Be aware of what your current caps total is and only list items in your machines that would put you to about 29k caps.
---
Presents award you caps. I think like up to 1k was the most I ever got out of a single present? And if they're just spam opening them? They're rolling in them. That's part of why no one wants to trade for caps right now - they're worthless.
---
Its unlimited caps
---
Joining you now, thank you so much!
---
Lost 2k today
---
Would Bethesda lose money they would fix it in fuckin lightspeed, but this bug *earns* them money
---
He wasn't the one who listed multiple 30k weapons without watching over it 🤷‍♂️ Who would you blame if it was multiple people who bought each item instead? Either way it's your own fault..
---
I carry one around with 90% weight reduction for the memes
---
That dam is a good, easy source of caps. I'd be very sad if they took that event away. 
---
On a side note I get a kick when that event is running at the same time as the Prison Break event
---
It's bad manners outside of workshops.  A camp owner isn't necessarily going to risk pvp over a picked lock because initiating pvp puts their camp at risk of destruction.  Most of the playerbase loathes pvp.  It was a miscalculation by BGS and adventure mode pvp has been incrementally scaled back over time.
---
youtube Angry Turtle magic weapons. 
---
The armor perk makes these weapons do alot of damage and certain perks on the weapons will do it without the armor.
---
See i tried that and it wouldn't let me place the wall.
---
No probs, I've always got some for sale, but I'm not playing much due to boredom
---
Like what u/Ben-333 said,but it also depends on what kind of of build you want. 
---
A three-star unyielding combat chest might be better than a 1-star junkies SS chest if you are running a bloodied character.
---
I've already commented on this.  This is the best data we have because bethesda doesn't tell us this shit.  Until YOU come up with data suggesting otherwise, because this would be your burden of proof, this is what we have.
---
I saw one set up like that in the Mire the other day, but on PC instead! I wandered around there with my camera out; one of the most memorable CAMPs I've seen so far. :)
---
I would honestly say to never put up anything you don't intend to sell. One time I was max caps and I was trading with someone and I requested a weapon they had and they put it up for max caps and I bought it because I actually wanted it but he probably thought he was just teasing me? so. Never offer up anything you aren't willing to lose- even in your machine. 
---
That said I am sorry you lost out on so many caps due to an exploit tho. It's a hard lesson to learn.
---
This char is a Stealth Sniper VATS so which foods are best for that one regarding Carnivore or Herbivore is best?  
---
This char can carry 290lbs of gear and only has 7 STR. I try not to carry a lot of junk but a lot of food including a lot of Stimpacks, Radaway, and Purified Water.
---
I have a lightweight legendary Grenade Launcher (Two Shot) I tote around for fun and I'm obsessed with getting a lightweight Missile Launcher for the same reason. Would that be worth it? Or are missile launchers sucky, too?
---
Can you elaborate?
---
This. Can be very fun if used correctly. Quad would be best.
---
Did you try it using brick walls? Place one, destroy it, place another, repair the first. You can change the wall type afterwards to wood or steel or whatevs
---
Well, let’s start with how you are complaining about something that has no gameplay implications whatsoever. Your gameplay is in no way effected by someone else having a camp that floats in mid air. You don’t have to go to anyone’s camp, even you own.
---
I have yet to see an uncreative floating camp. In fact, I am tired of seeing the same ground based camps copied and pasted everywhere like they are prefabs. So if it’s not effecting you and leads to a lot more player creativity and camp variation, then it just sounds like you are whining about something that should become standard to me.
---
Probably means the daily and weekly challenges to claim a workshop. I just claim it, do the defend event and keep dumping junk into stash as often as possible.
---
This is me. Every day. Oh 12 308... guess ill take it anyway
---
I’m running a heavy gunner if that helps
---
That sucks that I lost out on all my work because of this. I dont think I will need to learn from my mistake in the future since a only a fool would start over from scratch. I'll be leaving until I hear word that this is fixed. I cant sit here and accept the fact that all my hard work was taken away by a joke of a player.
---
Ah. I was using metal to begin with so i used that. I'll try later with brick.
---
You can talk to random settlers and some of their interactions can get you rep, you can also turn some of the raider quests into settler rep and vice versa if you are prioritizing one
---
How would you get to that armor
---
That's not helping me at all, how about you tell me which sub to use.

---
Look from the top and move with the zipper to one end or the other and no issue.  It has the same size hit box as the paper bag.
---
Yo mate. You messed up by putting top tier items into your vending. It sounds like dude was smart and brought a mule to buy the stuff he wanted from you.
---
Big boxes
---
In fairness, you lost hundreds of hours of farming because you thought it would be funny (weird joke fyi) to list your prized loot in your vending machine to begin with.
---
Sorry but this one is on you.
---
have fallout first would make this event a lot easier because you have almost infinite junk if you stalk up on it
---
Dude. I would load a nice Fatman and a bunch of mini nukes and crouch atop the Gorge
---
Bridge. I would put passive mode on and launch mini nukes into flatwoods at new players. No damage, but it was fun to see them running about with no idea where they were coming from. 
---
Now..not so much. There’s not enough new players to make this enjoyable.
---
Oh, I’m sorry I was too unspecific for you. “Sitting at 20% health shouldn’t have any benefit over being at full health and having a few non invasive addictions or a mutation that has no downsides.” Does that make it more clear?
---
That’s why you made your original comment, correct? Because you think bloodied builds are “OP.” That they do too much damage as is so why would they need any other way to buff that number.
---
And so you are making an assumption and arguing that part without proof and now are demanding me to disprove your statement?  lol
---
For the game to have 10k players on over a 24 hour period would require a lot more then just 10k people playing the game.  While play sessions will vary from person to person and day to day it is pretty safe to say there are far more then 20k people who own the game on Steam. Which would equally apply to consoles as well.
---
I got knight captain and sergeant back to back. But took forever to get officer and still haven't gotten paladin
---
You basically just said my immersion or opinion isn’t valid because it differs to your own, What would be the point of having a discussion with you then? , No one is complaining apart from you complaining about me even making a comment lol Maybe work on your reading comprehension &amp; stop trying to pick fights with ppl on the internet.
---
You must finish Wastelanders and get the necessary gold to buy the plans in Vault 79
---
So it would free up some carry weight without having to use the traveling pharmacy and thru hiker?
---
Thank you
---
possible banning ? that’s hardly an exploit it’s gross negligence on bethesda’s part. there’s no way
---
Negative Ghost Rider... The entire paper bag can be clicked. The duffel back can only be clicked on the ends of the bag. It's a major inconvenience to rush back to my loot and have to figure out the perfect angle to click to get my stuff back.
---
Well, the trophy isn't even showing for me. So there's that.
---
FYI, I have 2 alts on a second account and access to a second PS.  If I had wanted to, I could have loaded in an alt and fast travelled down, made two fast purchases using both characters,  then loaded in my third to make my final purchase. 
---
I would have had no idea this was meant as some sort of joke.
---
Solid advice, thanks! Forgot to add the Muts. AR, marsupial, eagle eyes, egghead, bird bones, scaley skin, speed demon, HF, grounded, and herbivore. Not having class freak kinda sucks so i was thinking of dropping some.
---
Contact customer support, they may do so, unlikely though.
---
Yeah, I love most of these (sadly blood eagle nest doesn't fit in my little town).   
---
Wish there was something that could be done about building on a slope with them though.. as Appalachia isn't all that flat.
---
Thats disappointing about the medal
---
Alright I’ve done a few raider quests do I have to do the settler ones too
---
A hint I would suggest, blueprint some useful structures to help you traverse the terrain to climb cliffs or buildings!
---
Most likely. I do the same, not a PvP player in the least.
---
I think people are forgetting the season is free, too. You gain atoms along the way too.
---
I couldnt change the wall types from brick to anything else
---
I've not been playing since a faschnat ended what's new?
---
You realise that I was being sarcastic, right? 
---
But jokes aside, this emote can be done in a day.
---
My original floating house. Structurally balances over a single foundation. https://imgur.com/a/1kmgqpl
---
I was talking to my friends about this too- they give us faction tent skins - I would love faction based scrap box skins. Raiders/Responders/Settlers/Free States.... It's free real estate.
---
Ooo I see. Thank you.
---
About 1000 
---
edit: To clarify, I think its a percentage and not a hard number but I feel like about 1000 works just based off how late I've gotten to the queen and my average damage numbers with my gatling plasma.
---
God I envy you. I’m level 86 and ready to call it, buy the rest.
---
Probably healthy to just give it a rest for awhile.
---
Abso fucking lutely. I'm surprised they haven't done it already.
---
It costs $22.95 a month in Australian Dollarydoos
---
I made a suggestion of adding in a between character vault legendary perk
---
Damn dude a nocturnal mole miner gauntlet? I’ll give you 30k caps for it
---
Deep pockets and plenty of legnedary perks that reduce the weight of items.
---
I’m level 76. I’ve not touched NW...ever. I’ve also missed a few daily non-NW challenges
---
 
---
This event is boring. I do it, but it sucks. I might just spend the atoms to complete this.
---
You sir get an upvote. My thoughts exactly. I’m almost done with the season as well. I’m already tired of the overall grind.
---
I debated on just spending atoms to finish, so I could get the stuff and take a break from the game.
---
It has exhausted me to no end having to try to knock out the dailies after a 12 hour shift of work. It just made the game feel like a second job. I lost most of the joy of exploring the game.
---
I'm all for this.  The life of a pack rat is a rough one.
---
So it is possible?
---
Did you put the camp machine skin on it? Apparently thats causing that. Take the skin off and replace you camp.
---
Oh cool now I know where to camp out and wait for the head shot.
---
Honestly I think I was just trying to prove to everyone that it  could be done.. and I didn't stop to think whether or not it should... haha 
---
memes aside... honestly - get as far as you think you can and buy the rest if you've got the atoms for it. i really hope the next season will be better in terms of grind. I think seasons is a neat way to add rewards to the game and I like the over all idea. but i think it can be improved upon
---
It would be possible theoretically, wither that Bethesda will do it is another thing entirely.
---
Do you have the end of the legendary run camp skin I’ve heard it’s a bug
---
No problem.
---
Oh man there are a tone of new players on Xbox.
---
OOO I havent tried this lemme try right now!
---
Game is a must play for fo fans imo. I loved it And played it through 3 times, waiting for the dlc with great anticipation.
---
That's some education right there=)
---
Received a reply on my ticket. Was told itll be addressed in a patch...
---
Overestimate? On Xbox almost every estimate for commando and heavy weapons are a little too low. For example a TSE Handmade is work 30k on reddit nearly every time. That website has it at like 10
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Good to know thanks! I've been trying to follow some guides out there but there's so many. I'll keep checking around though to try and find them, thanks for the info!
---
It can be fun. Problem is, it causes no real damage. 
---
A small fix would be to add rad damage. If it was able to hit for 1000 + 1000 + 1000, then, it would be fun to use and somehow lethal.
---
I tried an explosives only build, and it is the worst explosive weapon in the game, by far. Only useful to bash enemies and get a badge. 
---
Now, my two shot auto grenade launcher is the ultimate event weapon. It tags and causes a lot of damage and crippling.
---
The perk packs will have value when the legendary perks become available. But yeah Id say the bulk of non conumables/currency Ive gotten so far will never be used. The armor skins are worthless to me because I always wear outfits that hide armor and I dont use power armor either so none of that is of any use to me. I kinda hate they split the power armor paints up into individually compatible types when most atom shop paint will do all the types. iTs just filling
---
Aaah, so you literally get 500 atoms for reaching level 100 on the board.
---
I would just keep an eye on some of the NW ones for easy points to be honest tho - even if you don't like the mode - a few don't require you to play the game at all! 
---
like the take a photo - just log into the lobby - snap your photomode and youre done 
---
or the place your camp? log in - spawn on the edge of the map in BFE and place your camp however many times and youre done. 
---
so that way you're not missing out on too many points but yeah at this point i would not blame you for buying it
---
I have a junkies fatman....nobody wanted it lol
---
Currently 84 I think but have done all dailies except nw today and I have three or four weeklies to do still, and yeah things burned out quickly. I have been tired from doing this everyday and if I get too tired I can just buy the last ranks if I need too, honestly though I don’t use really any different cosmetics for too long and rarely buy from the atomic shop anymore either.
---
NAVAIRSYSCOM?
---
Unfortunately, there are people who have nothing better to do than camp an unclaimed workshop.
---
I was on my 100+ heavy gun user once, went to the airport to claim that workshop for the daily. It was unclaimed. Just as I was about to start the claim, something caught my eye. It was a stealthsuit player. I moved so he couldn't see me anymore, and he re positioned.
---
Basically, he was waiting for the claim to start so he could snipe.
---
Basically didn't claim walked over and drop a few frag mines on him and walked away.
---
edit: I play with Pacifist ON, so it did nothing to him.
---
Well, maybe I’ve just been doing poorly then. I may be a terrible salesman.
---
Comes out as 14 euro if you convert it , still a better deal technically , but I also understand that economies are different and it probably feels like more of an attack on your wallet .
---
Correct.
---
Your definitely not alone. I finished last week &amp; just have lost interest. I've played this game for over 3000 hours &amp; somehow the run broke me.
---
Yep, trying to do it without the atoms. I’m sitting on a few months worth of 1st payouts,so I’ve got about 4000 saying “come on, buy the rest. This can be all over now”.
---
So tempting!
---
The tower adjacent to Morgantown train yards is also a fairly quiet spot with a locked box. I mean, it’s not easy. That’s why they called it a challenge.
---
😣 Then i guess im going to take a break till they add some kinda double sided wall
---
WHOA WHOA ITS RIZZOS
---
You can buy the mod from train and other bot vendors
---
That's not the point... of course an emote like this could be done in a day, it could probably be done in less than an hour even.  The issue is it doesn't matter how quickly you make it if you can't get it into peoples games.  The only way to add new assets is through updates which means this thing has been sitting in the game files for at least the last week and would have already been done and ready to ship with the update weeks before that.
---
I'm not sure how you can stay immersed with how glitchy this game is from a gameplay standpoint.
---
wow smh bethesda so lazy!!!!!!11!!!1!!!!!1!1111
---
/s
---
Spawn in under the "M" in "Morgantown".  There's a bank right there with multiple safes.  You could feasibly run in and pick them before you even stop being invisible at the beginning of the match.
---
Ok
---
Ma'am but yeah lol that is where I am at as well. I get off of work and then I have to log in and do all of these extra things that I normally wouldn't do. 
---
Some of it has been a lot of fun tho - I have a good dedicated group of friends that I play with an we've had some amazing weekends grinding events and fucking around so that's been amazing honestly. But the solo/after work days where it's just a grind and then I don't feel like exploring and doing other things..
---
I've also gone thru way more ammo since Seasons came out than I have my entire 1700hours in this game lol I'm really tired.. I am just gonna sit at my camp in my rocking chair and wave the newbies in for a while.
---
Legendary perk: reduces weapon weight.
---
30%, 60%, 90%
---
How many ranks? 3?
---
Again after a 12 hour shift of work, having to spend an additional 2-3 hours gaining an overseer rank in NW (which can take several matches), kill 3 creatures in NW, or praying to the RNG gods to find 3 legendaries that haven’t already been killed by other players. It’s a grind.
---
Legendary Specials give you more perk points to spend.
---
That sounds nice.  It’s funny, I still haven’t finished wastelanders yet.... :(
---
I’m at 1800hrs and this with the BOS scrapdrive...
---
I’ve started my millionth heavily modded Skyrim.
---
Well if you mean vendors then yeah I’m def listing at about half in trhere.
---
Oh..absolutely some of the NW stuff isn’t easy.  I just haven’t bothered.
---
If you think Beth is going to devote any time to an OPTIONAL, FREE atomic shop item you're dreaming
---
They originally had no indication for if you already had the plan or not and added in the (Known) because so many players asked for it.
---
That might have been me! I'm planning on nuking a few random places like Wavy Willard's and Camden Park to take some cool pics - at this point I'd like to just see people nuke any place but Fissure Site Prime.
---
17.99 cad :(
---
I have been playing since release and got three, total. Two of them, consecutive, two minutes between them, Top of the World and the resort next to it.
---
I want to believe it was a bug, because the chances of that happening must be incalculably remote.
---
Is there a min level requirement to get loot? 
---
Just wondering.
---
I use the grocer mod on my backpack instead of high cap because it equates to more carry space overall just because of all the beer and shit I carry around.
---
It does feel like you’re a puppeteer above a game world at times &amp; not within it.
---
You know I did initially take that into consideration and I know my level is not the norm but I'm like level 380 on one character with like 150+ perk packs waiting to be opened so for me they are of no use. 
---
But another thing I wished was that the atomic power armor skins had been bundled to allow for other cosmetic rewards because I also don't really use power armor. And I was disappointed to find out that the ghilli armor skins cannot be applied in NW which I think would be the only real place anyone would use those. 
---
Definitely agree with you there.
---
You're a dense fuck do you realize that?  I'm the only person that provided data to back their argument and you have the audacity to say I can't extrapolate off that data but that you can take that data and apply it as you see fit to enhance your argument.  Get the fuck out of here!
---
If you’re using a wallpaper though it makes no difference :)
---
Yah I tend to carry around a lot of stims/radaway....and food items.  Looking forward to snagging that
---
There is a building at the very south end of the Morgantown map. The basement of that building has a safe. This spot doesn’t have many crates, so full teams are unlikely to spawn here.
---
Monongah has a safe in one of the buildings. This place doesn’t have great loot, so teams rarely spawn here.
---
Monongah mine has a safe, but this place actually has good loot so teams may spawn here. If you do spawn here and want to play the game, make sure to loot the chests in the fire.
---
One of the buildings north of the high school has a safe under the porch next to a large crate.
---
Yeah I wouldn't blame you at all at this point. A lot of my friends bought a few levels along the way when they got their 150 atoms and a couple just bought to the end because they had the auto complete bug that lost them a lot of progress so it's just been me grinding for about a week and I'm over it haha
---
I equipped the perk that shows the terminals on the compass.  Remembered to equip the hacker perk.  Spawned into Morgantown and sprinted straight to the nearest terminal- hacked it, so far so good.    Sprinted to the next hacking like mad feeling like I was about to get shot any moment...  **success**!  
---
No pop up.
---
Look at the challenges- it says *pick 2 locks* **not** hack 2 terminals...  FML
---
Yeah. The ragdoll in this game is ridiculous and the collision is worse. So many legendaries lost to creatures falling through the ground and the imposter sheepsquatch exploding and launching across the map.
---
Man I LOVE YOU 
---
***How about you read the rules of this sub?***
---
And we’re also *not* allowed to give direct links to the other subs that engage in bartering posts.
---
Sorry. After I sent it I saw it. Geez
---
I'm weak and spent my fo1 payouts.  
---
Don't really regret it per se, but at the same time, I wish the dev's would so some stuff that is not so terribly grind-focused.
---
XD but i needs a full metal home. I built a storage container style home. Cant be brick. Authenticity. XD
---
Ughhhhh
---
Wastelanders took over my xp farming route and now I'm sure they will screw up more locations with pointless npc's that serve no purpose
---
What you should have done was left the server straight away after the first purchase put you over. Its the only way to stop it happening. Obviously the guy in question was doing dodgy stuff but it could just as easy happen with any other cashed up player. Ive had to do it myself once when a player had a nice old spend up. I felt like an arse for bailing but it is what it is
---
Yeah most of my friends finished last week or over the weekend as well and I've just been trucking it out by myself and yeah. I've got 1700 hours around about right now and yeah. I think I need a little breather. I am glad there's some time between now and the next season and thankful that I am not really interested in BOS so I don't have any FOMO
---
No problem, dude. Cheers.
---
Yep I grinded hard to finish it as quick as I could and I hit rank 100 and it was just like meh. I'm not grinding that hard next time.
---
Bolton Greens also has a safe behind the entrance desk.
---
Okay, bye. 
---
Getting caps isn’t that challenging once you know what to do. 
---
Tell me, how many caps did you have on you before this happened?
---
For sure at .4 gold bars per challenge reset and with max streak bonus you can easily get 10 gold bars a day. Whats worth buy with the gold is another problem entirely. Money gets pretty much everything except a few cosmetics. Also made a reference to the shops that tell you that every time you buy anything with gold
---
I have an antiarmor faster fire I refuse to sell because of its reduced weight, but I sell all my 308 ammo. I think the LMG is for people who only use 308 and recycle or sell everything else. 
---
I would love to be those people.
---
I always have a surplus of addictol. I guess I'm just lucky? My friends can never find any.
---
You'd be surprised. 
---
Player vendor/display case issue went a month without any response until people started cancelling their subscription. Bethesda responded pretty quickly once that happened and fixed the issue in a few weeks.
---
Same happened with the recent double wall issue. Days of no response despite the massive backlash. No response until people cancelled Fallout 1st subs again. Once again, immediate response and then issue I believed resolved just recently, like several days after the response.
---
By the same token, the promised feature in patch 21 of getting pocketed mods for Secret Service armour have yet to be addressed. No one has cancelled their Fallout 1st sub over it. No response to date (that I'm aware of). Certainly not a quick fix.
---
You're only 2 people, sure but you may inspire others to cancel their subscription too, much like with the past instances.
---
Up to you though. It's your sub. No judgement either way. Just saying that cancelling subscriptions seems to gets results, that's all.
---
Had this haopen twice. Once during the legendary run. Once ore seasosn...
---
Both times my game crashed loading into adventure mode... same deal. No NW. NO atom shop. None of the shit IKNOW can cause it...
---
Photos. Ticket. Nothing but thank u for your report.
---
Im not.. MAD. But i was hella sad. Deflated. Torn down by the bullshit
---
He must never buy stuff to have 15K in atoms.
---
noone's forgetting that. the thing is people don't realize how many atoms they used to get in a week, typically enough to buy most things in the atom shop you might want, each week. to now 2 thousand in a 3 month peroid.
---
It’s kinda heartbreaking when u defeat a legendary &amp; it disappeared
---
Haha the temptation must be really strong. I just wanted to say I could do it.. but ahhh it's tired me out man. I'm just so tight with my atoms since I can't earn them every day like I used to be and I can't buy them or Fallout 1st very often because I am limited on money sadly.
---
I don't think so. 
---
A friend that I met while running around as a low level handed me a Hazmat suit and took me to Scorched Earth way back when I was about level 20, and I managed to get loot from her there.
---
Obviously, there are quite a few levels below 20, but if you're fighting the SBQ at level 20 you're either being escorted by a higher level or you're absolutely insane, so if there was a minimum level requirement, I would expect you to have to be higher than level 20 to hit it.
---
Yeah that's totally understandable. I know it's not something a lot of people enjoy anyways.
---
What exactly are perk loadouts? Can somebody explain
---
&gt;You're a dense fuck do you realize that?  I'm the only person that provided data to back their argument and you have the audacity to say I can't extrapolate off that data
---
You are literally showing data that shows a steady 10k players over a 24 hour period and assuming only 10k people play the game on steam. Which would mean that those 10k people would have to play 24 hours a day 7 days a week. 
---
Even assuming each play session is around 8 hours. To achieve an average player count of 10k across 24 hours would require at least 30k players.  And assuming PS4 and Xbox and non Steam PC players had the same amount it would still jump that number up to 90-120k players.   
---
Which is way the fuck above your 30k total player bullshit number created from bad math and stupid assumptions that every single steam player plays non stop.
---
Ant-Man:  Gain up to 50 carry weight for each sugar in your inventory (max 50 sugars)
---
Yea I feel like next time I won't be grinding so hard. I was grinding the repeatable every day after doing dailies and all.. Next time I definitely want to pace myself and I don't know if I will go so hard either.. it depends on the awards I guess.
---
Its looking like the Europeans are still sitting on the top of the billing list unfortunately for us. 18 cad translate to 11.50 euro . I'd be paying equivalent of 23.45 Canadian.
---
So long as the implementation is at least as good as the existing PC mod or at least doesn't interfere with that mod if it's not, don't mind either way.
---
It'd be nice for console players to enjoy the freedoms that PC modders have had. It's a real game changer. I don't think I'd ever continue playing this game without it.
---
If you're on the PS4 it's on sale for 20 bucks and it's at least worth that.
---
I do the same with the razorgrain soup. With Salt and Hiker it just lasts forever and weighs nothing. I just like that it restores both bars and heals a bit more health than corn soup iirc.
---
Wait for a busy server with high level people that participate in events before activating the fake sheepsquatch. 
---
With the legendary run, more people help with events for xp and score farming.
---
This.  Is exactly what I do.  If I see I’m about to get close to my limit, I take out high values, cut power so they can’t find my camp.  And if you know that someone is buying over your limit, cut loose and exit the server.  I had to do that once.  I had actually cut power to my vendors bc I was close to the limit.  Someone from my team saw where I was (at my camp) and found me anyways.  As they were heading towards my vendor.......dropped out of there lol. Sorry about that!
---
Let me see if I can just attach it for you
---
Yeah its a shitty oversight to not allow the ghille skins to be used in NW. I agree its probably the only place they would ever be used by most players and maybe even actually useful. Im not even sure why they omitted that because other weapon and power armor &amp; armor atomshop skins can be used there.
---
I'm up for it but I can also see the complaints from people saying why isn't this legendary perk passive, this should be a part of the base game etc. etc.
---
Yes I’m not sure how practical they will be given special point restrictions however they’re still most certainly a welcome addition, (I hope perk loadouts will include special point redistribution so u can put as many points in intelligence for the crafting perk cards) ect
---
You mean craft the armor, mod it, and put the armor up for sale?
---
I wish I had your stash space.
---
yeah true sadly
---
I probably would have reached that if I didn't have so many dailies and weeklies auto completed....
---
Ex-navair Lakehurst good times though
---
From what I can tell, the threshold is at 1,000 damage in order to loot her.
---
If you're having trouble hitting that number, you have a much better chance at getting it if you join a team, as I'm pretty sure that all members of a team collectively contribute towards the 1,000 damage goal, and once that number is hit, then anyone in the team can loot her.
---
I see your point, but I won't act as if the people at Bethesda were serious at their job. I love the game, but remember, they are the same people that gave us magic shotguns and vending machines with a hole from which people could take whatever they wanted to take, among other things. 
---
I would love to visit their physical offices, because I am sure I will find a guy dressed as Jangles the monkey, pulling levers on a big machine.
---
Despite all the bugs I would say it's always been worth it. If you can get it for cheap - even better. They are always working to get rid of bugs but that said for every bug they step on - a new one seems to crop up. 
---
But there's plenty to do - especially now that NPCs are in the game and more to come? It's a pretty good time to pick it up.
---
It's an enjoyable game- even more so with some friends.
---
Lmao yes
---
But only to reach lv 15, not to bypass it!
---
Yeah that happened to quite a few of my friends - they ended up buying their way to the end.
---
My strength is maxed but I’m a hoarder
---
1 step forward &amp; 2 steps back unfortunately. Definitely better than at launch but still has issues. If its only $20 then you'll get your value.
---
I already carry that much for sweetening my cranberries!
---
That would be splendid
---
Yes but those don’t work when you are wearing a hazmat suit or power armor
---
I'm just not sure either - because you can equip the ghillie rifle skin and of course the ghillie outfit. I was pretty stoked to have a skin for wood armor in NW lol but they crushed the bush wookies dreams.
---
*nervously looks around, see people drinking coffee in skull cups
---
I'm more interested in exploring Vault 51 since i'll never play NW
---
I don't know if its because of my style of play but I've never used adamantium skeleton and have never noticed limb damage unless I jump off a cliff and break a leg
---
You don’t have to do both but I would recommend doing the Settler ones at least until you get the Chinese stealth suit, mostly because it’s absurdly expensive to buy with gold and you can get it for free in the Settler quest line.
---
Bethesda owes them those atoms then, not that they'll pay out.
---
Dude, it's easy.  Save the anger for 200M cork or something worthwhile.
---
You:
---
&gt; And so you are making an assumption and arguing that part without proof
---
Also you:
---
&gt;  And assuming PS4 and Xbox and non Steam PC players had the same amount
---
Go on though.  Very interested to see if you get how dense you fucking are.
---
Im at 84 i think and Im over it tbh but ill keep slogging. And it is a slog now because Im at the point where theres not enough score in the dailies to advance a level so I need to grind the repeatable more than Id like. The end is close but still feels so far away.
---
Stop describing your masturbation evenings
---
Yeah, but for those who don’t have max on STR or AGI, you can use the extra points for Thru-Hiker or Traveling Pharmacy.
---
From what I've been seeing in the data mining groups, season 2 doesn't have much stuff that excited me although if the fusion generator they data mined fits on one foundation block then I'll happily grind for that.
---
I know bashing with guns causes durability loss, so I think the same is for melee blocking.
---
Didn't know this!! Might pick it up now if its only 20 bucks. Thanks
---
My assumption would be...
---
Using your existing SPECIAL points, you assign perk cards, then save that configuration as a load out.
---
Then, you can swap between load outs easily.
---
Example, I'm on PC and use the mod. One of my characters is a heavy guns user, but I also use shotguns.
---
Loadout 1: Has the Heavy Guns perks
---
Loadout 2: Has the shotgun perks instead of heavy guns.
---
Loadout 3: Fast Travel loadout, all weight reduction perks, Party Boy for 3x boosts from alcohol and anything else that can reduce weight or increase carry weight.
---
Alright I’ll try
---
Is the mod even unlockable? I've had to buy 3 of them, but I just wanna unlock the dang thing so I don't have to worry about it anymore.
---
Try to do radiation rumble and line in the sand and the guided meditation as much as you can is my only suggestion - it’s what I’ve been doing. Canned meat stew or other food / well rested / lunch box bonus. We’ve been using building teams and switching to event teams if we can complete the event. In between I farm super mutants wherever I can find them :(  But yeah it’s freakin tough at the end when you’re so close to the end.
---
I have a lvl1 powered sent assassin leather chest and a lvl5 psa raider arm. Lvl 5 fe laser. All sorts I’ve been collecting lol. Works well on a smurf character
---
You're neither the first to suggest this nor the first to totally miss the fucking point of the seasons.
---
Likely a MAJOR point of switching to seasons was to cut down on the glut of free atoms entering the economy.  I'm personally coming up on 30k atoms and I didn't even get into actually doing the old daily challenges for almost half a year after the game started.
---
That's why rather than piling on more and more atoms with daily challenges they reduced the free atoms and offset the amount with "free" atx items.
---
They don't really need to retain people that have already hit rank 100 in the first place.  If you're dedicated enough to the game to have already hit rank 100 with weeks to spare you're not exactly a risk group that's suddenly going to wander off.
---
Post on LFG and you'll probably find one
---
I dont bother with armor. Im garbage enough at pvp that it doesnt help me anyway. I actually use the Raider Pathfinder outfit that provides better camouflage than the ghille suit in my opinion. The patchwork browns tone in super well with the browns of the bushes, rocks, trees etc.
---
Do you have a link to that possibly so I could look at it?
---
You Published something for sale at a price. Someone took you up on that price. Who's at fault here?
---
How he managed to do it multiple times in a row is a different story, but, me for example- I've got a mule/vendor account that has 4 alts with 30k caps each, and the vendor has anywhere between 5-25k at any given time. Then my main has 1 alt at 30k, and 4 characters each between 5-25k. So if I wanted, I could dump 150k caps on something without too much work, although it would take me a little time of moving characters around.
---
If youre on xbox i would buy a set from you for sure.
---
Explosives in general suck hard ass. Partly due to weight, partly due to Bethesda directly nerfing Demo Expert way back (instead of just reducing the explosive effect on Explosive legendary guns), and partly because *every big enemy who you would want to use explosives on has innate explosive resist that drags it to a tickle.*
---
Great game design when you have an entire class of weapons rendered useless. Also they break ultra fast as well.
---
Did you try setting it to wumbo? Nah im just playing check your plans in your inventory.
---
That defines the class of gun but not your preferred legendary type. If you want a low-health, high-damage build you’ll want Bloodied weapons and unyielding armor. As a heavy gunner you’ll likely want Sentinel as a third perk on your armor as it reduces damage taken while standing still. If you want a high-health build I’d recommend vanguard armor, probably still with sentinel, for the same reason. For high-health legendary you can go with anti-armor or (maybe) two-shot. 
---
I have a bloodied/unyielding commando and a junkie/vanguard commando. I think I prefer the junkie one as there is less HP management required.
---
Your best "odds" are going to be with the Purveyor. At least there you can choose 3* Ranged. Or...there are other forums [whom shall not be named] where you can procure such artifacts.
---
Just go to your notes tab lol
---
Yeah I used the raider underarmor I have dark hair and a mask but I’m normally moving anyway. I normally don’t actually like the bush Wookiee life. I can’t stay still like that lol
---
You immersion? Really, that’s where this lands. Your saying in a game where people show up to the Queen fight with invisible weapons that the issue is the floating camp you choose to go travel to, cool. On the point about your opinion, you have an opinion and that’s great, but it doesn’t mean the person with the floating camp who also paid to play the game has to be subjected to yours the same way you don’t have to be subjected to his. What you don’t get to do is tell him that his opinion is the incorrect one when the developers have made no comment on the subject that I know off. In fact if anyone’s opinion is incorrect it is yours. Currently the game allows these camps to exist, if you have an issue with that then you need to provided reasons other than “my immersion” as to why.
---
And how is this entire post not your complaint about floating camps. You went out of your way to visit a entirely different platform to make a statement how they need to be removed from the game. You make no suggestion on how to rectify the issue while keeping all players happy, just that they need to be removed. I can think of three major ways Bethesda could implement floating camps off the top of my head, and I’m not even getting paid. Maybe you need to work on your attitude rather than just writing up a rant on Reddit and expecting people to consider anything you have to say. And stop trying to dictate how others enjoy video games, especially when they have no impact on your gameplay.
---
Oh man so true. 10 20 30 308 at a time. Always. I think that nowadays the thing that makes me happier in this game is finding a vendor with 1000+ 308.
---
Was gonna digest this as well
---
I’m only level 70
---
I found one on rogue trader but it keeps jerking me around
---
It's a percentage, and it's true of every enemy in the game. I'm not sure exactly what, somewhere in the realm of 1-2%, but yeah. I discovered as much way back when trying to level an alt in Nuked Whitesprings. A level 10 10mm pistol bullet isn't enough to get kill credit on a level 50+ Glowing Ghoul. I either needed to dump the whole mag, or use something harder hitting like a .44 or hunting rifle.
---
I was about to say the same thing. I'm on xbox as well and would be interested.
---
Former NAWC Warminster/NAVAIRSYSCOM Pax River. Don’t miss that stuff anymore.
---
I'm wondering what's causing this and what that text stands for.. Is it some kind of texture that bugs out and instead displays as (placeholder?) text?
---
Wow, you're still not helpful, go figure. All I wanted was a name.
---
It's the price you pay for Bethesda dumb system.
---
You've learned the lesson any of us that have gone through the same thing - you put only the items that won't tip you over the edge in your vendor and nothing more. With a bit of a buffer to account for any caps you earn from playing the game.
---
It's also a good idea of knowing ahead of time what are good cap sinks to spend your caps on when you get close to the limit - serum plans, recall keycards, etc.
---
Sorry I am on PS4
---
I have been wanting this to make my ultracite PA worthwhile again.
---
Yeah that happened to me in rad rumble too. Only works if the person I'm on a team with finishes it.
---
You don’t have to fully choose a side until the final part of the quest. And I’m pretty sure there is a pop-up that warns you when you when you choose that you can’t go back.
---
That's a lot of atoms
---
The thing I want the most in this case is separate tabs for clothes and armor. That would be awesome.
---
If only SB took explosive damage. Then people would have a reason to get a two shot mirv fatman :)
---
No matter how trash everyone claims it to be its literally all i play. Ive made alot of solid friends on 76 and even at 700 hours i dont find it repetative at all. Its the greatest tome waster out imo lol
---
The shocks themselves won't actually have a ton of value. Although I'd still price them at least at 500caps (the flux cost alone is at least that much). But you may not get a lot of interest. Not a ton of people run Ultracite, especially now that T-65 exists.
---
The plan has value A) to completionists who want to know every plan and B) to people trying to mod their Stranglerheart armor, since you have to do it yourself.
---
Do you have a TL;DR of the key takeaways from the video? Not everyone has an hour to spare for what may or may not be worth watching.
---
Not at all, you won't deal enough damage at really low levels to get stuff from the queen herself, but if you're there when she dies you'll likely score the event rewards. Ground control would probably be the best idea, although most of them might be high level, and be hard to deal with anyway, try to stay close to higher level players and support them.
---
No problem. I actually recently just got back into it through this sale as well lol
---
Im lvl 502 amd have played with a group since day one. We launch on the Queen five to six times a night. Only one of us have gotten that plan to drop. That's how rare it is to drop.
---
It's surprising you feel this way. For me, aside from the tent pole events, this game felt more lonely and isolating than past games. Especially before Wastelanders but even afterwards relative to past games.
---
Wow, you’re still not getting it. 
---
The rules of this sub do ***NOT*** allow us to give you a specific name to other subreddits that engage in bartering.
---
I don’t really know any other than bloodied and sneak we need more perk cards
---
You can only do one raider quest a day
---
I don't have it unlocked, sorry there stranger.  
---
It said 1/2 mods unlocked, so I crafted 20 machete and broke them down, but no dice.
---
You have to wait 24 hours before it starts
---
What'cha looking for stranger?
---
My main knew the plan...so I upgraded my alt’s vampire machete
---
I just want quick load outs for lock pick and hacking
---
It's rain water.  Of course it's dirty.  It's essentially just an aesthetic item.
---
1 day It's tech scavenging, the next one is Rocksy
---
I have waited 3 days for Rocksy’s daily quest to pop up.
---
This is something they NEED to do to progress the BoS "questlines" they have already set up. In the end they can just say the over zealous wanna be BoS guy  misheard the requirements on the garbled radio broadcast.
---
Rocksy's quest alternates with Wren's. You'll get The Importance Of Communication one day and Retirement Plan the next. You only get one raider daily per day.
---
I did indeed thank you for commenting!
---
It is unlockable, yes
---
Thanks anyways man. I know ive had it before and sold it but i unlocked a sick legendary machete for my friday the 13th/bog wanderer outfit and it would  make this badboy pretty lethal but i cant find it anywhere
---
You get really mad when someone points out your failure at basic math don't you?
---
Definitely Secret Service.
---
u/Ben-333 already explained that you have to complete the Wastelanders questline to gain access to it, but I thought that you may want to see some stats so you can plan properly.
---
A new currency is introduced towards the end of the Wastelanders questline (which I will not mention here because of spoilers), and that currency is what you're going to need to purchase the armor plans.
---
Here are the prices for the armor pieces:
---
|ARMOR PIECE|PRICE|
---
|:-|:-|
---
|Secret Service Helmet|1,650|
---
|Secret Service Chest|1,250|
---
|Secret Service Left Arm|750|
---
|Secret Service Right Arm|750|
---
|Secret Service Left Leg|750|
---
|Secret Service Right Leg|750|
---
|Secret Service Chest Jet Pack|2,000|
---
|**Total (Without Jetpack)**|5,900 (4 weeks' grind minimum)|
---
|**Total (With Jetpack)**|7,900 (5 weeks' grind minimum)|
---
You can get 200 units of this currency per day.
---
You can get an additional 300 units by visiting an NPC named "Smiley" in the Wayward bar once every week. This costs 6,000 caps.
---
This means that you can get a grand total of 1,700 units of this new currency every week.
---
Here's a table featuring the above paragraphs to make it a bit easier on the eyes:
---
|Units gained per day|200|
---
|Units Gained from Smiley (upstairs in the Wayward bar; costs 6,000 caps)|300|
---
|**Total per week**|1,700|
---
So he's the guy dropping all the spoiled veg
---
It wasn’t always that way, I remember when wastelanders came out I could do both everyday for at least 4 weeks
---
Take a look at norespawns on YouTube. He has a lot of videos. I use his vids as a baseline.
---
Yup, map knowledge is huge. And terminals and locked containers are \*static\*, they will always be there. But may have been looted by another player before you...
---
Which I could have been more help. What stinks is I have one with the mod on it in my stash, but Beth won't let us remove mods from items 🙄
---
look on youtube for inspiration.  Search DTD Gamer or Decoy Dungeon
---
I started playing in April, so I missed that event, but good to know.
---
Hasn’t been implemented in the game yet
---
Power Fist with Armor Penetration.
---
Thats what im running now, i have serrated but the extra poison damage would be choice
---
It can't send your stats negative. But if you had, say, 65 rad resist, you'd now have 5. If you had 35 rad resist, you'd now have 0. Same for Energy resist.
---
The mod that increases strength by 1 and calibrated shocks on legs that give +110 weight carry over standard PA.  With those mods I actually manage fairly well. I got a couple of armor bits that reduce ammo, food and chem weight by 20%. And jumping from my armor to PA still gives me room to loot without issue of getting over weight right away.
---
SCORE replaced it about six weeks ago.
---
It can't send your stats negative. But if you had, say, 65 rad resist from your other armor, you'd now have 5. If you had 35 rad resist, you'd now have 0. Same for Energy resist.
---
I use the full face black helmet that came with that last FO1st outfit. I move around too. I play a Sneaky Bush Wookie rather than a stationary one. I like to experiment with using natural camouflage, line of sight, distraction opportunities etc to move around and avoid danger for as long as possible. I did get one win hiding in a open field once by using line of sight to my advantage. I cant beat players on combat skill so I try and hone a different set of skills. It makes it fun and interesting for me
---
You get them both once when you first get to Crater. After you do them initially you get onr per day. This has been the case since WL launched.
---
I really wish there was one for rifles.
---
Yes. Report.
---
Wow you don't get it either that sometimes people don't know where to look. I still don't know where to look. That's not exactly helpful to somebody who has been working their ass off trying to find a camp selling serums. Why don't you get off my back, okay cybercop? I KNOW what the rules are, I just needed help.
---
Ok, I was pretty sure, I wanna grind for atoms rn but half of the shit I do doesn’t register for the challenges
---
I payed 2000 caps plus the flux to have them put on mine. The next night my friend got them to drop. The best part was he got them from a failed Queen event. We logged into a server that had 3 mins left on her and we killed her 10 secs after it failed. I knew when he got soon as he started yelling "guess what I got!"
---
Oh, and it is also worth noting that you can hold up to 5,000 units of this currency at a time.
---
All good homie. Send me an invite if you ever wanna squad up. Im always on after work
---
No you should leave them alone, they are not bothering you.
---
There are a ton of ideas but it depends on what you're into.
---
You can do a camp where you mostly takeover an existing structure and build into that.
---
Have a hidden camp that makes use of caves or holes in the ground.
---
You can make your camp building statue like so it looks like something, like a space ship or a dinosaur or giant car.
---
If you have the cosmetics for it, have your camp look like a theme like a diner or bar or garage.
---
Make it look like a makeshift outpost, like BoS or Raider or whatever else takes your fancy.
---
Already have
---
Thanks for explaining it I really didn’t want to watch a 20 min video of a dude saying 1 min of good information
---
Not out yet. Should be out next week
---
I'd have to reinstall FO4.  Usually steam keeps all your save files, so presumably it's there still.
---
I made a Battlecruiser back then also lol
---
https://imgur.com/a/uezBh
---
You do realize you have 5 character slots, and each has its own 30k cap limit, meaning your total cap limit is actually 150k if you max them all?
---
And you noted that buddy had an alt account which means it is super easy to hold the world and fast travel back to your camp because the alt account just sits there.
---
Take note, you didnt get pwnd/hacked/scammed, you got bested at your own game of flaunting your wealth, their guns were just faster.
---
If you're running a heavy gunner... you really should be using power armor, because of Stabilized. But outside of that, my favorite armor set that isn't Secret Service is Marine armor. Best mix of DR/ER/RR in my humble opinion. No paints for it though, if you care about those (other than the SCORE Ghillie paint)
---
I saw it a few times
---
So I get an alt account to be roommates and I have double the camp?
---
I mean, I run 4 weight reduction perks maxed and have about 500 carry weight.  You can carry all you want already.
---
Except for the fact he had loads of ammo in the vendors that he didn’t get legitimately?? Surely that hurts the game
---
You know, sometimes when someone is struggling like this, especially if they’re polite and not copping an attitude, I DM them the names of some bartering subs. 
---
Today?
---
[No, I don’t think I will.](https://i.imgur.com/ddXt0p1.jpg)
---
Go learn to use Google.
---
Absolutely. I always do that.
---
Try it for yourself before listening to someone saying it can't be done.. because it can. Literally just did it.
---
Apparently you have to put the T fuse in first.  If you *did* put the fuse in first, then IDK what's wrong.  It's bugged right now from what I heard.
---
Sneak won’t help you too much since you’ll likely be standing more than kneeling. 
---
For armor:
---
Unyielding armor boosts your SPECIAL stats the by up to +3 per piece of unyielding armor the lower your health. 
---
Vanguard boosts your DR and ER buy up to +35 the higher your health. 
---
For weapons:
---
For low health you’ll definitely want Bloodied weapons. 
---
For high health you have more options, basically anything that isn’t bloodied. Anti-armor should be one of the better ones. If you want to take a bunch of chems, you’ll want Junkies weapons (boosts weapon damage the more addictions you have, up to 5 addictions)
---
According to the rest of my team nothing was in these areas.
---
Absolutely report them. Take screencaps as evidence too.
---
I don’t use power armor sometimes because of use of fusion also I don’t know the acronyms if you could explain
---
The QUEEN? because she's basically immune to explosives.
---
Also a 2shot fatman is better than a bloodied one, just FYI. Just breaks faster ;)
---
and then it despawns.
---
You may have to pay a few dollars more, but Americans have to live in America.
---
I did put it in first it says it’s still an error
---
I'm generally a "if you want to break the rules, that's your problem" kind of guy, but from what I gather, that's against the Terms of Service, so take from that what you will.
---
Yeah it’s a bug in the game because of the recent patch. Apparently so only one person can do it per server or something like that. If you’re on xb i could let you do that quest on a private world so you can continue, at least thats how i managed to complete it on my alt
---
I'm actually wondering how many burned out people picked up legacies &amp; b2525 fixers etc. I think part of it is there's just very little point in grinding when you already have the best items. So then you lose interest, maybe its not because of the legendary run at all?
---
Like I said, IDK what's wrong then if you did it in that order.
---
I might try the vanguard i don’t want to be a glass cannon
---
How does it hurt the game?
---
Oh fr? I thought I seen someone do that event on YouTube? The collisal problem or whatever?
---
Yes please join my party jrkzz
---
my daily scrip has been pretty fucky
---
Thanks appreciate you!
---
Yeah that’s what I meant. I never have more than one or two replies to reddit sales posts.
---
Fixers cant be scrapped, no. To get the mods you need to scrap combat rifles
---
Mad Dog Malone is a little bitch tho.
---
The ones who designed the gold bullion grind are the baddies.
---
There should be a side quest of taking Commander Daguerre to see the mansion of Mistress of Mystery, considering her love of the series anyways
---
Surely cheating to get ammo and making profit from it to gain things illegitimately is gonna affect it some how
---
Your atoms have been eaten by S.C.O.R.E., never to return. I'm sorry for your loss.
---
The Legendary Run does give you atom rewards at specific intervals, though, so by grinding for score you are sort of indirectly grinding for atoms.
---
Could be two things one is someone on the PBE/PTS or whatever is called uploaded it or when the Dev was showcasing it they uploaded it but yeah they delayed bringing it out last patch so we are still waiting
---
Ask yourself before reporting: Does this hurt me in any way? Is he attacking me, trolling me, or forcing me to do anything against my will? Is he causing legitimate problems with the game? 
---
He has a ton of ammo. It does not hurt you. You can buy said ammo. Its your choice. Maybe he did get it using an illegitimate method. Maybe he spent forever collecting ammo while only using melee. Either way, hoarding ammo and supplies isn't causing any known problems.. so why not leave him be?
---
I only report the people that are also selling the ammo at their vendors
---
The acronyms? DR/ER/RR? That's your Damage Resist/Energy Resist/Radiation Resist.
---
At least we get to see that 16 times the detail from the new vantage point, huh?
---
I think so for some people. If people only ever want the meta guns and things.. Personally I'm looking for a blood swing speed pipe wrench.... my dreams probably scripped every week haha.
---
Ohhh okay that makes perfect sense! I can’t wait to try that out fr
---
I gotta admit, it was fun for a while to run bloodied. And the HP/Rads management is offset by the boost to SPECIAL. There is also a useful card for low-health builds called Serendipity. It gives you a chance to avoid damage below a certain level of health and, in my experience, works pretty well. I never really figured out the best way to run low-health in high rad areas but that’s likely as much my failure as anything.
---
Alright I have been unclear about most of them thabks
---
Well when I make a post specifically saying that I am SURE that what I am saying is the wrong sub, you don't need to be a cybercop. If you had pointed me in the right direction, I would have thanked you. Your comment was vague and didn't suggest where I should go instead.
---
This is the biggest BS ever
---
Hyped for something that should have been in tha game over a year ago? Yes I am hyped.
---
Wait till you start doing cork. My fiancee and I are on a private server and barely got enough concrete, and just gave up doing cork.
---
Fuck that, Where is my Manta-Man quest that lets me become the Emperor of the Mirelurks?
---
Bullion resets 20 hours from your first purchase of the day, like scrip. It doesn't reset with the dailies.
---
If you mean the challenge objectives that don't complete properly like killing the SBQ and visiting Berkley, etc. you can take a screenshot of the challenge and email support to get the atoms added to your account.
---
Become an amazing game designer, make then hire you, and fix the game..
---
But if it’s alright for one guy how come we all can’t just have one of them on resource sites all the time?
---
The season? When zorbo hits the end. He moved a tier a day. Always has.
---
I gave away a furious explosive minigun because my Tse minigun was doing much more damage. That, I know.
---
powerfist &gt; DCG &gt; MMG &gt; Gauntlet
---
If they group up with you in a private group, they can place it in your camp. From what I've read, it can't be removed, so it's a permanent budget loss.
---
So, while it's easy to avoid, it can be used to harm new players who don't know better.
---
Yeah I can dig that. I am pretty good to molding to other people's play styles because when I first started to play NW - none of my friends were remotely interested in it. So I had to solo queue alot and so I had to learn to play with others styles. I've played with everyone from the fire-huggers to the hunters who use the terminals to track down and murder players. It's super interesting to me honestly.
---
Oh thank god, I’m about to get 200+ atoms
---
Just join public groups. Literally everyone I see in public groups is doing their own thing, they're just there for the group bonuses and free fast travel points.
---
I forget the best for combat but I use brain bombs and cranberry relish. They stack and boost exp by about 46%
---
You may not need exp now but you unlock your last legendary perk slot at 300 and likely way more to level them up.
---
You and me both brother.
---
This worked for me!
---
Razorgrain is better.
---
Ok got it thankS
---
It's not in the main game yet.
---
However, from what I understand, it is present in the PTS. 
---
So, assuming you know how to launch up Fallout 76's PTS, then all you have to do is nuke Monongah Mine, as that's where the event is.
---
Based on [the event's wiki page](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/A_Colossal_Problem), it should be pretty straightforward from there, so good luck!
---
And scrap kits become absolutely useless when you have fo1st
---
1,000 damage should be enough if you are a single player.
---
Sometimes 1,000 damage from your teammates works too . But it dose not always work .I\`ve met both low level with enough damage teammates but I can loot and cant loot from SBQ situations .I think it may be a server problem ,im not sure.
---
My bloodied builds are 2x stealth, 1x power armor, so I don't use any of those. Stealth won't need either since you don't get hit (much), and power armor doesn't benefit from white night (breaks reallllyyy slow anyway) and does the same thing as Adamantium.
---
No I remember that he moved really slowly. At least slower than a tier a day
---
If they take Fort Defiance that’s going to piss me off. Line in the Sand is one of my favorite events.
---
Fixers share mods with combat rifles. If you know a mod for the combat rifle, say the suppressor, then you know it for the fixer.
---
Not in a... nuclear wasteland.
---
Incentive to play should always be in the game content and not in a reward system. A reward Staten should be the bonus on top
---
Serpentinty helped me when I got it out of a perk pack it is fun to use
---
People will get butthurt about this and then go on to use various glitches with their camps
---
Use a friend to stay on your world to keep the connection stable for high risk transfers. Containers are faster and more convenient than trading back and forth.
---
Yes it did. A simple Google search would have helped you. 
---
And just because you decide to break the rules, you expect others to do so as well?
---
Sure thing, bud.  Not my style. I have respect for my hosts when I’m a guest in their house.
---
Oh naw man I don’t! To tell you the truth idk what that acronym stands for lol
---
I got two last week. One at the rusty pick and then my next try a few days later at Pleasant Valley.. Only two I've ever gotten, and they were basically back to back lol.
---
Plans should be accurate on the wiki.
---
But claim all the gold for yourself if you want Bullion fastest. The Rep gain is about 3 days worth of dailies.
---
It was a nuclear winter reward, but I can't remember what it's called. Other people can place it in your camp.
---
WAIT. you can build in NW? My mind is BLOWN
---
I transferred a Bear Arm plan last night with no issues. Look like I was lucky
---
Literally just got done with that event. I like climbing to the top of the flag pole on top of the asylum and fighting the scorchbeast at their on flight height!
---
Scrap kits are completed useless to me as someone who’s never had fallout1st... because my stash is always full and can’t fit more junk in it
---
You can remember whatever you want. He started at level 30 and the season is 70 days long
---
Playing bethbyro games on console sounds like pure suffering.
---
I can actually respect that view, Fallout 4 is lonely as hell and the generic settlers make it even worse. Not to mention companion who while are better than in Fallout 3 are mostly lame compared to New Vegas where even the Super Mutant and Dog have story.
---
Fallout 76 I wish just encouraged socialising better
---
Poop! Add my poop to the pile!
---
I was in no way, shape or form promoting others to break rules. Now you're just complaining at this point.
---
You probably benefited from a bit of lag with the Mole Miners. You were the one with the rubber banding health bar .
---
Bro just hit the zipper. Its intentional they ain't gonna change it. /s
---
Five. It's 99 budget, a flamingo should be 20.
---
on pc I don't think there is a limit....my husband has like a billion pictures.  We need an option to sort pictures or put them in a different order or something.
---
Take off the CAMP skin from the Legendary Run, restart and boom on the map again.
---
I admittedly don't have it myself, but based on this description, it definitely does sound pretty useless.
---
I think it would have been more entertaining if it gave you some super-irradiated power water whenever a radstorm floated by your C.A.M.P. that just immediately killed you upon ingestion.
---
You have no real proof they're doing that
---
It is pretty terrible and it seems to just get worse and worse lol, but most of my friends play it on Xbox and there's no cross save atm.
---
I would settle for a new patch that would fix this horrible lag. I can wait on the SS. Right now game breaking shtuff needs to be done.
---
Bloodied power attack +1 strength powerfist does the most damage
---
I’m in the same boat, about a week out from finishing. Season 2 I’ll likely do about 50% of it and and buy the rest and if there is a season 3 I’ll just buy as much as I can and likely shut the game off forever it’s getting old fast
---
Wait, you don’t have it yet ???
---
U do know there is literally radiation in the air that the rain is falling from?
---
Are you sure the veil doesn't work? Bandanas certainly do and so does the surgical mask. I wear those regularly and get the "your gear has protected you from environmental hazard" (or whatever it says)  when I walk around ash heap. Haven't worn the veil in a while but I seem to remember getting the same notice when I used to wear it.
---
Dang that sounds amazing. I wonder why we're limited to 50 on console. I have more than enough room to store as many as I want lol.
---
All of the water in the water table is still radioactive.  That's where rain comes from.
---
This is really sweet. Nice work!
---
Technically between the jetpacks, no, but you can't get AP refresh on power armor, so the SS jetpack gives you potentially infinite "pulse" range by just tapping your jetpack and letting your AP refresh (if you have it up high enough) refill before you tap again. Bird Bones, Strange in Numbers, and a Group are pretty essential to this as well.
---
You can't really do the same in power armor without using consumables (sometimes server lag works in your favor and allows you to do this for a "while", but it's unreliable.)
---
What's crazy is that it's so easy to do. This fucking crap shoot of a engine man
---
Yes, there are ways.  They aren't legitimate.  It involves blueprinting the machine.  If you do this, be warned, you can't *fully* delete them and it will take up budget in your camp forever.  Since it's not a legit thing you're supposed to do, don't be surprised if you get an email from Bethesda about it one day (although probably unlikely).  
---
In short, yes, you can get it in your camp.  Do I recommend?  No.
---
Lol maybe
---
Faster than pumping ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
You also have to move/replace your camp once you take the skin off to get it to show up again.
---
I swear I got two resets for scrip today.
---
You asked for someone to trade with you. That’s against the rules of this sub. So anyone that *did* trade with you was also breaking the rules by engaging in setting up a trade. 
---
A simple Google search would have solved this for you. Don’t get snippy just because you can’t perform basic Internet navigation.
---
Don't fill your vending machine with items priced at more than what  you can hold.
---
Yes please!
---
200 per shot to the Queen with a commando means you are doing great, dude. 
---
Are you using covert ops and the other one in the right order?
---
So the statement 
---
&gt;It’s not the best way, it’s the Moose way.
---
was completely lost on you?
---
Nobody is debating how to max caps. It’s just having fun at corn soup runs.
---
I think it was a couple of weeks ago.
---
I mean the point of being bloodied is kill or be killed, and you have the firepower... who cares if they stealth, spray them freeaim. Or is everyone too reliant on VATS and can't freeaim for shit?
---
Ugh I finally ran into one of those today. It made the fight take so much longer because she never landed. There were a ton of people there too.
---
Well that would suck. I've seen like a bazillion posts about it on here about it so I've just avoided the skin. 👍
---
Also use the buddy system.
---
What B2525 means?
---
Never know when you go shopping and get got by flamethrower traps. Carrying that much scrap is bound to lead to one bad experience on day. But hey, do you.
---
I haven't been at a failed Queen fight in well over a year. PC master race?
---
I'm pretty sure I can solo her in 10 minutes or so with my bloodied HW build.
---
And I can solo her in 15 seconds or so with my magic gun if I really want to be lame.
---
Don't forget to drink a nukashine before a big fight!
---
&gt; And I feel.. tired. I thought I would be really excited but in the end - while the grind is possible - it was a bit much.
---
And if you had spaced it out over another 4 weeks, maybe it wouldn't have felt so bad?
---
Bloodied 25% faster fire rate and 25% less V.A.T.S action cost
---
same, im over 150, theres no way im starting over
---
[This one maybe](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i3eogw/bos_the_ultimate_in_lazy/) ?

Razorgrain soup:  
---
\+5 Rads  
---
\+30 HP  
---
\+10 Disease Resist  
---
10%  food  
---
15% water
---
Corn Soup:  
---
\+12 HP  
---
\+3 AP regen   
---
15% water   
---
I'd rather have the extra healing and disease resist than a paltry bonus to AP regen.
---
Yeah, I got it through Game Pass but I wouldn’t pay $60 dollars for it.
---
It’s solid but can see while playing that a lot of planned content was cut out.
---
Hmm I have tried scrip yet at all. I had to go and trade caps because I was excited to get the secret service left leg plan which is the final plan I need for just the armor and I was counting on that 200 gold bullion. So I said screw it I want it.
---
No worries.
---
The acronym stands for "Private Test Server"... and I have absolutely no idea how launch it on any platform. Hold on a minute.
---
Okay, I just looked it up, and apparently you have to be playing through the [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) launcher on PC, meaning that Steam and Console users are unable to access the event at this time, which sucks. Sorry. 
---
I would assume that the event is going to be released soon enough, though, as it was apparently supposed to be released this previous patch.
---
Huge props to you! This looks fantastic
---
Or, you know, if you're doing something like RR where most everything is glowing, trade in the 15% from your rifleman perk for 60% for the event.
---
"Nothing?" 
---
Everything in that event drains your health
---
Man I’m at 10 and I’m already tired of it
---
When did this happen mine has always reset with dailies. One time I played right before the rest go all 20 tickets and turned them in 20 mins before 8:00 then got 20 more tickets after 8:00 and it was reset.
---
I feel that man, the pain, GT/KusHMonstA151, add me if on xbox and if and when we are both on i will give you one
---
Also loot/junk farming and crafting. Those 4 will be such a huge QOL change for me.
---
When you activate those pylons in the area, those actively sap your health.
---
They also stack, so if you yourself have activated all three, you're pretty much being melted.
---
I, in my infinite epic gamer skillz, have never actually been able to successfully complete the event. However, from what I've gathered from others who HAVE, their solution is to just take a bajillion stimpaks with them and just start spamming them when their health is being drained.
---
I also feel obligated to note that when you are downed by the damage, ***you still function as a conduit,*** so you should wait for the death count to reach 0 instead of immediately suiciding.
---
This is amazing
---
Head master, to be precise. Master of Mystery has a good ring to it. Though I'd rather have a nice formal black sport suit with a green ascot, accented with he Eye of Ra. Dress not really my cup of tea, looks better on Sophia. Surely the fabricator could make that for me...
---
I can’t believe everyone is ignoring the important update.  Attention: Thanksgiving displays on sale right now!
---
I have 2 armor pieces with -20% weapon weight, it helps a lot for rifles.
---
Oh ok thanks
---
So Bethesda responded to the ticket. They are aware and investigating why weekly challenges for some users auto completed and not granted any score. And that their CS is not able to edit or grant any score. Just wonderful what’s the point of them awarding us next week double score IF we donate materials while this week we get robbed off all score. 😑
---
I miss the Enclave too.
---
Maybe I should work on my aim...
---
Pylons take away your health, and then you know... the assaultron
---
I still need a “flipping the bird” emote. Since vault boy only has four fingers, and despite the use of the word “fuck” that fallout has no occurrences of the middle finger being used, the emoticon above the player could be a cartoon bird doing a backflip.
---
I'm assuming it's either because you're a pylon or there's an Assaultron dressed up as a sheep that's firing a giant face laser at you. Probably both.
---
You do have a point there I won't argue with you.
---
YEEESSSSSSSS THANK YOOOOUUUUU 😍😍😍😍
---
Yeah
---
Do you have any fixer plans or stimpak diffuser plans in your vendor set up as the default price?
---
From what I’ve seen it appears to be a polished game but for some reason it also seems like it’s rushed, obsidian didn’t take their time to include more content in the game but they did take their time to perfect the amount of content they put into it if it makes any sense.
---
If there’s ever going to be a sequel to it or if obsidian are going to work on more similar games to it, then I really hope they take their time to make it a fallout-like open world RPG game. Bethesda needs some competition to step up their game
---
that sucks, but i bounce plans, ammo and legendaries between three alts daily and havent had any issues, maybe im just lucky
---
edit- will say of course it is ridiculous we dont have shared storage already
---
I activate all pylons myself then go hide in the shack while Stimpacking like a junkie and try to get hits on the imposter sheepsquatch. If others are competent enough, easy completion.
---
I know all the mods for the combat rifle but it says I know none the fixer
---
Sorry, I know I showed up 7 days late to the propaganda efforts. I just slept in a bit.
---
Happy cake day.
---
I just got to 89. Tomorrow definitely 90. I'll see how I feel. I may just grind the rest of the way. And buy the nuka cola door too. We'll see. I have a friend of mine who just started today. He said "I had alot of fun, more fun than what I thought this game had to offer. What a surprise." I think he will fit right in.
---
Fallout 76 is something I just go on to jerk around, anything involving performance and quality is moot.
---
I'm not an expert, but the source of the glitch seems to be the game not realizing that the t-fuse is inserted and to fix this I just kept server hoping until I was able to insert the t-fuse and scan the blood samples
---
Hope this helps
---
Hahah I remember that one. It ended with sleeping with Fuzzy Brenda lol.
---
&gt; You can remember whatever you want
---
lol.. thats great
---
Exactly 🤣🤣
---
As with anywhere, it has good parts and bad parts, but still...
---
Been waiting on this for awhile now
---
Well I mean, it’s not really the brotherhood asking for the stuff in the first place it’s that fanboy
---
My ninja wears the assaultron helmet + Chinese suit because Metal Gear Solid. 
---
Farewell, Snake...
---
I have little doubt it will be disappointing after perk load out manager and probably break it.
---
Just make a new character to run the quest and get the items again. Then you can move them to your other character. That's what I did after I realized you couldn't get the items back once you scrap/sell, etc. them.
---
So Bethesda responded to the ticket. They are aware and investigating why weekly challenges for some users auto completed and not granted any score. And that their CS is not able to edit or grant any score. I lost 6k score today. Just wonderful what’s the point of them awarding us next week double score IF we donate materials while this week we get robbed off all score. 😑
---
And only nearly two years, its quite the improvement in response time! BGS deserves...a pat on the head.
---
Yeah, it was. Admittedly I've only played 76 casually. Haven't even seen the whole map yet. Also, I haven't played Outer Worlds at all, but I plan to someday.
---
I feel like Bethesda is the Magic Conch and its always "Maybe someday..."
---
To maximize your selling value, get your effective Charisma to 20. That gives you 25% of Base Value.  For purchases, a Charisma of 25 lowers the buying prices down to 175% of Base Value. 
---
**These are the maximum results. Any Charisma above 20/25 doesn’t further affect prices.**
---
Hard Bargain adds +3 *invisible* Charisma per rank (it doesn’t show in your Pip-Boy) for buying/selling only. 
---
Grape Mentats adds +5 Cha. 
---
Sweet Roll adds +3 (Can be hard to find/craft, so Mothman Egg Omelets are a good alternative food for +2 Cha)
---
Beer adds +1 Cha (up to +3 with Party Boy/Girl)
---
Certain Underarmor can be modified to grant extra Charisma. I use Protective Lined Military Fatigues for +2 Charisma.
---
Unyielding Armor can boost all stats except Endurance by up to +3 per piece, for a potential of +15. 
---
I have an alt that has a Charisma of 1 and uses Unyielding (+15), Hard Bargain 1 (+3) and Beer (+1) when selling and I pop a Grape Mentats (+5 more) when buying.
---
A little prep before shopping can make a huge difference.
---
And just to follow up, I’ve tested this with Serums. Base Value of 2000. Whether I have 20 Charisma raw and no Hard Bargain or have it pushed up to 36 raw with Hard Bargain 3 added, the best I can sell them for is 500 caps. And the lowest I can buy them for is 3500. 
---
And Serum Recipes with a Base Value of 10,000?  Best I can get it to is 17,500 caps when purchasing.
---
Excellent idea.   I started a new one recently to handle all of the "level up" dailies for the Legendary Run.
---
Play around on [perksdragons.com](https://perksdragons.com) and build your "goal". it'll give you a map of what unlocks at what level.
---
Which event is it? I haven't uncovered the dam location yet, am I not able to see the event? Sorry, I am low level.
---
I should complete the legendary run tomorrow. I'm actually glad that there wont be anything to do for a few weeks  I have a small pile of games I've been meaning to get round to. It will be nice not feeling like I need to log in daily for a while.
---
I seem to always find a handmade at the end of the riding shotgun event tunnel in one of those idek mole rat tunnels? By a dead body while looking for the caravan supplies
---
Haha sounds like a pretty fair  assessment.
---
They just added in the "I'm sorry emote" so give them about two years and they might add  deep-pocketed SS limbs onto the "To Do List" :)
---
yes, FYI i just did it on my alt. 
---
switch servers until it works. No, you wont lose the sample or fuse you collected. Private server is ideal for 1stCucks
---
Whilst I agree with the majority of your points I don’t think people are realising that the perks packs are possibly one of the most valuable rewards you can earn: Legendary Perks are coming next month and it will take *hundreds* of perk cards to upgrade them. So gaining three packs is equivalent to twelve points ready to spend on the new perks, should you be high level enough to qualify for them.
---
Not sure why this is downvoted. I can't think of any other setup that would be able to do a higher amount of damage with the proper build.
---
Hemlock holes too!
---
We don't need more carry weight, we need more space in the stash.
---
Yeah I’m gonna be taking a break and focusing on drawing for a little while. I haven’t been able to draw as much between work and wanting to complete this so I’m glad to be done with it.
---
That’s cool.  Updoots for you.
---
Haven't even pushed past the first part XD . I've stopped caring about the grind and just log on to shoot things.
---
Why would anyone waste their caps when it’s a guaranteed spawn item?
---
If you do plan on trying this, do it at a workshop instead of your camp
---
Maybe if I had paced myself better it might not have been so bad but I think it was also being behind my friends who bought their way to the end that pushed me to grind harder as well to catch up
---
As far as I know, Bethesda hasn't actually set a specific date and time for when the Legendary Run ends. The time is "Mid-September" for now.
---
Also, I'm fairly sure that Zorbo has pretty much always moved one tier per day.
---
However, I have heard people complaining about how Zorbo was doing some sort of demon teleportation across the board for them, so that may be where the problem arose from here.
---
Lol I hope nobody buys it, tryna waste people’s caps
---
Hold on let me get my sniper rifle to zoom in on that zipper so I know where to click.
---
Yeah that true. They could be useful if you were just starting and were picking up everything you see though.
---
We don't need perk cards, scrapkits, repair kits, heck even lunch boxes!
---
The grind wouldn't feel so damn tedious if they gave out actual unique rewards. Also they need to seriously buff Bullion for future seasons. The amount is a joke compared to the other currency
---
Don’t donate. Boycott. Bethesda is scamming us
---
I hope they can make some changes to make it more enjoyable next time
---
I was able to complete it on a private server because I have 1st.
---
I also was able to invite a player I saw on the map who was low level and was inside this building. I sent them a txt and invited them to a private server and they completed it.
---
Thanks for sharing this tip.
---
not much.  add me.  It may not be on tonight but if you transfer me your legs I'll make them. Just give me the materials to make and lill trade them back for 250 caps each
---
Yeah you got a long scope on that? You might need it.
---
You need to have more faith. But your name is dedicated to hating on em so there is that..
---
That event screws me over the most when it comes to accidently one shotting. I have a double barrel with instigating so I just cruise around one-shotting the mole miners. I've had to train myself to slow down and see if they're legendary first before pulling the trigger since the green glow just loves to vanish so quickly.
---
Don't buy it until the last day, just play regular until then.
---
Yeah. Long scope recon is the only way I roll.
---
Same here. But I was so tired of grinding that I've decided to buy the final 8 ranks.
---
I've been just staying in stealth and jumping out of the fog. Whats the right order? Saw a few vids of folks with the same gun doing like 1k a hit. Like i said, i put a Prime receiver on it and that only upped it to about 400.
---
I'll stop selling my 5.56 at 2c the moment people stop buying my 5.56 at 2c.
---
Resets in this game are actually incredibly odd.
---
Caps, Bullion, and Scrip reset at a different time than Daily and Weekly challenges, and even then those ones change a few minutes before they say that they are going to.
---
I already have hundreds saved up on two characters so.. a few more is a drop in the bucket to me. Those spots that could have been atoms or cosmetics. I hated grinding for the levels that only rewarded perk packs. It felt like I got a nothing rewards
---
The Assaultron probably got you, don't forget it's invisible and that laser is basically an 'auto death' laser!
---
Plus if you get surrounded by the Handy units, that can get you too!
---
I wasn't frustrated - there are plenty of things to do. I just wanted to get the word out, but it looks like you're already on it.
---
I was able to complete by logging into a private world ( I am a 1st sub ) and later in the afternoon, I was able to txt a fellow player I saw on the map inside the building and after confirming they had the same bug, invited them to a server and it worked for them as well.
---
As a Responder, it's all part of the job.
---
Man, if only the Thankgiving displays would go on sale again....
---
I know it’s kinda small but the .308 casing from New Gad might be an idea (extra props for displaying something so obscure 👍🏻)
---
Also love the display it looks fantastic
---
Sorry I don't understand?  What's on sale? 🙃
---
Hey more power to you- enjoy the free time. And that cute little space lamp
---
This
---
Please drink responsibly.
---
I was rolling with the headstone. Gonna go back to that I'm thinking.
---
Grind the DMV west tek and the burrows. Use all the experience and intelligence buffs you can.
---
How do you know it's 99? Knowing values of everything would be such a helpful thing for planning.
---
I built a box.
---
It's a good box.
---
It has a bed, a bunch of workbenches, and a stash.
---
The top is not accessible. Only the sides with the vault tec logo.
---
DC vs Crash?
---
Because I've been crashing a lot more since the last patch, but I have had like 1 server disconnect in the last 3 months.
---
It's all about roughage in your diet... the miracle cure...so corn... just might be good...
---
He moved once space per day from the beginning. 
---
And the Season ends on Tuesday, September 8th; ten weeks after it began.
---
Yeah although I am not grinding for anything I need bouillon to buy - it didn’t feel like a “legendary” reward. I think maybe 500-1k would have been better. And I am hoping that there are other ways to earn lunch boxes in the works because confetti mess is my new favorite thing
---
So tired of raider stuff
---
Or do they :3
---
That would suck, it's a good money maker
---
I think Fort Defiance would be more likely as a base of operations though
---
This is so true for me, I’ve grown so used to other players and I don’t know how I’d feel being so alone. I’ve grown away from single player games for this reason.
---
thanks
---
On PC?
---
I second your notion. Order of Mysteries was awesome.
---
Please sir can we have some more!
---
I even got my manly character in a dress for that questline.
---
All I want is a scrap box that is an incinerator
---
Damn it, Miller, I was drinking my whiskey when I read that!  You owe me about $5!
---
They want it so YOU can’t have it.. can’t have the commoners making any sort of a living...
---
Aw man! It’s okay thanks for looking it up for me! Are they adding anything else when they add that event? Ohhh okay they must be fixing a few flaws or something
---
I personally have my double sided walls blueprinted. You can do the same if you still have one at your camp.
---
The funny thing here is that if you don't really want to grind for the last levels' rewards, in most cases there will be even less joy to buy 'em and realize how unimportant they really feel afterwards.
---
I finished season without buying levels during double-xp and I was not able to make myself play the game beyond logging in and hanging out with friends afterwards. Stopped doing that about a week ago. It's sad there's no really good replayable content in this game after almost two years.
---
It just shows they don't play, do they even know how rare Cork is and how few things have it?
---
Heck most players won't even know where to find Cork!
---
lmao yeah they only sell the ammo they get legitimately and the ammo machines are just for personal use. go eat a rock
---
This is the answer. My bloodied melee ninja is not my main, but he punches max level supermutants for 15000 points of damage without drugs. With drugs, those numbers get even better. 
---
I hit the Queen for 500-5000 depending on different factors, and I know I could push it harder by combining food, perks, mutations and team benefits.
---
I think it might just be that people have shitty internet connections. The only times I’ve lost items in private servers was when my connection got spotty. Other than that, I’ve never had issues transferring large quantities of items between characters.
---
The Guided Meditation event drops it as a reward. Run that every time it turns up and you'll be swimming in Addictol.
---
I prefer peasant of the realm as my fallout designation
---
Junkies or instigator(if your looking to one shot most enemies) instead of bloody is pretty good too.
---
I use the boat up by the Pioneer Camp, it's almost always available. Unlock, quit. Load, unlock, quit. Done!
---
You could try and get the plane's safe in Morgantown airport... but that is almost always already picked on challenge days.
---
Not sure why but my goal was the Uncle Sam photomode pose. I hit that today and also managed to reach Ally status with the settlers, so I think I’m ready for a break too. I just don’t feel any incentive to keep going with the Legendary Run. It’s cool, but I’m so far behind on it and I don’t want to spend atoms just to unlock stuff.
---
But you would have a player banned on a assumption
---
Was it? Oh well, maybe people don't like the facts :)
---
not really
---
in Australia a trip to the movies easily costs double that
---
for a whole months access? bargain
---
Yeah, I was thinking this the other day. I wanna see a resurgence of the base and faction.   
---
It was criminal to make it so cool and then never go back to it.
---
I would be interested as well! What is your PSN name so I can add you? Thx
---
Wha-
---
Man I saw two players in the same outfit in NW use that pose to do the Spider-Man “YOU” meme last night and it made my day honestly.. I shoulda snapped a photo
---
If they mess with Mad Dog Malone they will meet my wrath!
---
And building, vendors, travel, joining groups, scrapping, repairs, it goes on and on.
---
Wouldn't the reward be up if we hit it?
---
SinistrMark
---
Nuclear Winter reward.  Likely unobtainable now.  It was called "Ring of Fire" if I remember correctly.
---
I'd rather have a perk that makes the 90RW effect on weapons apply to all mods as well.
---
You were sentenced to 12 years in prison for vehicular manslaughter.
---
Similar story loot wise, Instigating 50 damage reflect Walking Cane. Getting the good stuff.
---
It's an online game run on Bethesda's servers. They're always going to be the most current content. You didn't buy 76 \*with\* Wastelanders, you just bought 76, it's always going to have what's live now.
---
I hadn’t thought of that. I guess I was just gonna do inspirational posters or something, but that’s even better.
---
After reading this, i cashed in tokens for the very first time last night. Got this shotgun on my second token.
---
As someone who runs a shotgun build, this is excellent!
---
I agree but if 10 minutes have gone by and she's not landing...? I'm out. Cause if she doesn't land once by that point, she won't get defeated :/
---
He's always moved one space per day. Always. Since Forever.
---
There's already a mod that does it but an in-game system would be nice.
---
What we -really- need is special layout loader or some way to respend them. Can buy it for scrip, bullions, caps, atoms? Or maybe all of the above but we're going to need our perk points to level legendarys perk coins.
---
Thank you!
---
This is why on my gunslinger I find the two shot is more practically useful than my bloodied. I don't need the overkill generally and I'm using something else for the big bosses anyway.
---
it just works
---
Yeah all 3 of those are equally as viable if that's how you prefer to play. Bloody does slightly more than either, but melee can get such massive numbers, especially from stealth, I doubt it matters much at all.
---
Can't remember it but there are some perks which need to be set in a certain way to stack. Search the sub. 
---
Also, get into a group of mutated people sharing their mutated asses. That multiplies your benefits and damage of critical shots.
---
Order of Mysteries was great, just wish they had an outfit and veil for guys.
---
A decent run: Clancy Manor for Crystal decanters, Hemlock holes for golf balls, Grafton and the prison for super mutant pipe rifles
---
I did that once
---
When everyone rushes the same spot, it is anything but easy or fun.
---
Caps, Bullion and Scrip reset for the individual character based on when the last reset was done and when the first sale after that was made. 
---
It’s 20 hours from the last sale you did in that system. So if you sell something at noon, it resets at 8am the next day. If you sell something ten minutes later at 8:10, then the next reset is 4:10 am the next day. 
---
And so on.
---
Agreed!
---
If they ever introduce a CTF mod I'd be all in for a Raiders vs. Settlers skirmish.
---
Always had them on Xbox when killing ghouls at white springs, going to white springs at any point, and the SQB event. Always. I play on Xbox btw
---
Are you sure it isn’t your internet connection? I only ever get that error when my internet connection becomes unstable. Other than that, I don’t have issues transferring anything between characters.
---
You can tech fight the windigo colossus now, it just won't be the same fight in the mines.
---
 I seen one spawn in cranberry bog after a area got nuked, it was in those big pink trees.
---
I have a base charisma of six. If I pop a grape mentat after a Uranium Fever run I can get about 1000c at The Whitespring vendor.  In case you didn't know the vendors only have 1400c a day for you.
---
No it doesn't!😇😇😇

A lot of people are saying that they re having loads of problems on consoles whilst pc players are just kinda sitting on the sidelines with a few minor bugs. Maybe consoles are struggling more then pc and thats why they put that limit in place.
---
There are people who offer themselves as Intermediaries. Check the market. 
---
But you can always be scammed. Like in real life.
---
That’s not a perk loadout. You’re thinking of legendary perks and how you get points to improve those.
---
That’s not how it’s going to work.
---
As a fan of the classic games, it's interesting to see how Bethesda has treated the brotherhood. It would be interesting to see how they act, potentially as villains considering all we have done.
---
Drop a blue duffel bag and tell them that you're having trouble opening it and If they can help.
---
Yup.  I think Level 1 Bolstering Wood Armor with Sneak Detection is like, the best roll you could ever get for something of that low a level.
---
I actually saw somebody with the chicken coop today which is something I want... then I realised it doesn't spawn roaming chickens they're literally just stock in the coop.  
---
There is just so little on the legendary run that excites me and the theme doesn't even seem relevant for the most part until you get up to a much higher level. Who cares about Perk cards? and don't think I didn't notice that the 150 ATOMS rewards just happen to be enough to also help you skip just one level.
---
They should fix autocomplete, i just cant play for hour±, just to be safe...
---
And moreover, why not make seasons like in warframe, so i can chose one day and grind all missed dailys weekles score tasks........
---
I hope you're running the Intelligence +stim perk too!
---
It’s delicious and nutritious!
---
For some reason, my character keeps showing in-game as having a goatee, and I definitely did not do that (nor does it show in the character creation screen).
---
I removed the disc so im playing on gamepass. I can buy fo1st fine.
---
You cant purchase it while playing. You have to be on the main menu and it will have it in the bottom corner.
---
What I hate is that three of those Thanksgiving Displays have the same budget space as 5 normal displays. The only thing I find good about it is that its clearer by no glass in front of it.
---
Yeah, I'd gladly pay more atoms for a an more budget space, even if only by a bit.
---
Hopefully when the colossal problem comes out screws will be cheaper to buy/easier to farm.
---
Where do you get a wrapped cap?
---
Mort needs a better backstory, other than that, I'm glad Jason Mewes is getting into VO gaming.
---
I'm confused, what are we looking at
---
I think the chicken coop was the thing I was most excited about and I was a little disappointed that it doesn’t spawn chickens the same way the Brahmin pen spawns Brahmin but they still sit in there and cluck away so that makes me happy. They have a prime spot in my camp. The spooky tree was the other big thing for me. I love it
---
Oh yeah i think that’s what I saw on YouTube actually! Idk how to start a nuke but if your on x box and you ever plan on doing that I will help you!
---
Dealing damage degrades weapons, so technically blocking is fine. At least, I think so.
---
Level 85 here. Not a single NW daily done.
---
Haha it sounds like a sub goal. Main Goal - Complete the Legendary run! Sub goal - complete it without paying or playing NW! Lol
---
New Perk Card: High Noon.  Replaces your Bash attack with pistols with Fan The Hammer.
---
Vault Boy can wear a poncho and a cowboy hat, along with smoking a cigar and sporting a 5:00 shadow on the card.
---
There's a mod on nexus
---
perhaps change the gender of your character. its perfectly ok to be trans in todays gaming society :]
---
I honestly like the legendary run. Gives me a reason to log in and play a bit everyday. And comparing to other battle-passes out there i think it's pretty great that you can get everything just by playing the game. I hate when there's a free and a premium battle-passes and the free has just shit every five to ten lvls(with NOTHING in between)while the premium gets all the cool stuff.
---
I don't remember what rank I am, but I'm 250 score away from finally passing dr zorbo. The one thing I really want this season is that captain cosmo power armor.
---
Honestly I am on a hiatus from 76 for now,  but I hav3 been playing a heavily modded new game of FO4 and its quite refreshing. I have the sim settlements mod which actually puts the settlers to work for you, so when i make it back to the settlement they have pretty significant changes made to them that weren't dont by me. Makes the game feel much more alive and active. 
---
Plus I've got the difficulty scaled way up and things like Deathclaws, Sentry bots, Behemoths, and other large enemies are insanely tough to beat. The only way I was able to defeat the sentry bot i ran into was by hiding until it hit its cool down phase and then rushing it to hack it and make it self destruct. Honestly one of the most intense moments in this game ever for me. 
---
I only hope that mod support for 76 let's great mods like the other titles have come to life. Obviously it will be a bit different, but its still nice to think about
---
He probably had a +stagger perk equipped (Enforcer, One Gun Army, or Tank Killer). That'd be my guess anyway, but I don't PVP.
---
And there's a million ways to restore HP. Super Stims with the Science +stim perk restore like 30%hp/sec for 2 seconds then 6%hp/sec for 20 seconds; nuka quantum colas with Cola Nut perk restore like 400hp, etc. Dedicated PVPers know the tricks and are prepared with them.
---
The Ring of Fire Pit. It was a past reward for Nuclear Winter, so you can’t get it any more. But if you know somebody that does have it, they can place it for you. Just to be warned, you can only have a max of two, and the original fire pit from the atomic shop counts toward that.
---
Like the scorchbeast queen you need a  bunch of players. Me and my bro emptied multiple clips into it and its health was barely going down. In fact it was refilling after we stopped.
---
I'm not seeing anything other than the messenger lol
---
Broken, Glitches or not, I get bored real quick when I play RDO. Same with its single player. I can't bother to finish that game while I already put 500+ hrs in FO76 and still interesting each night.... so far.
---
While i agree that concrete is slightly harder to obtain. You can get 250 cork easily enough by going to clancy manor every now and again.
---
Steel is the easiest thing to obtain and made even easier with the scrapper perk. Just pick up every weapon you can get hold of (pro tip. 90% of enemies hold weapons) and scrap them.
---
Don't get complacent, they can do what they want and if they see it as an exploit you'll be on the chopping block. I'm not even going to risk it but you knock yourself out.
---
I just unlocked the captain cosmos pa today (level 88 I believe) and I'm ready to be done. When I get done I know I'm just gonna log in daily to trade in my notes for gold and that's it and put my energy into some other games
---
Okay, now I understand better. Thanks.
---
Yeah like those optional missions. Complete the legendary run. Optional: without NW.
---
There's only a certain amount of safes in the NW map.  You could search endlessly untl you get lucky and come across one, undefended, on your own, or you could do what most people do and ask for help locating one.  Eventually, people are going to know the good spots, whether by chance they already knew them or whether they had asked someone to tell them.  If this bank spot doesn't work for you, go find one at some of the other spots people mentioned.
---
While this challenge is going, everyone is going to be going for the same safes that you're going for.  You will *eventually* find one not being bum rushed by several people. If you're determined enough to get those 250 SCORE points, you'll tough out a couple of deaths and eventually open those two measly safes.     If you're so put off by sitting through a couple of matches for a relatively simple task, then just ignore this challenge.  But... some people want to have their cake and eat it too.  C'est la vie.
---
I do. Kill them all in the name of MODUS.
---
Bro is that refilling health thing a glitch? That shit be getting hella annoying lol that happens to almost every enemy I fight, I feel like it’s because the servers are slow? And damn that’s wussup that sounds right!
---
DCG and PF when modded have the same damage. But the PF also has a tiny amount of armor piercing with the mod, so technically it has the edge (in practice it's almost insignificant, but it exists).
---
Yeah i agree, i just keep seeing the same bloody build over and over again. Get it?
---
Yeah. Considering how the BoS feels about people using dangerous technology, I think they won't be too happy we launch nukes on an hourly basis lol 🤣
---
(1) add atleast 3-4 more nukable bosses deathclaw cerberus, giant plant creature, 4  horsemen behemoths ect with atleast 5-10 unique rewards 1-2 being rare (2) add a hotzone area with no pvp restrictions and rare loot maybe vault steel? Making the pvp based on faction would be even better (3) create atleast 6 monthly events. We get 1 monthly event then changes next month
---
It still  feels like an eternity between public events for me, sometimes you may get lucky and one will start right after another but most the time 5-10 minutes go by with nothing happening, making you wonder if you should cut out or wait to see if the server is still alive
---
I wish we could join Malone's gang, lol.
---
Game balancing
---
Until what is fixed? You being bloody stupid enough to have *anything* set at max caps? You having *multiple* things set to max caps? Your inability to understand that people, usually traders, have multiple characters with 30k caps *for trading and buying*? If you’re not going to play until your stupidity is fixed, then have fun not coming back.
---
I think Max specifically said No to nuking the scorchbeasts. 
---
Plus we're in the enclave. 
---
And we're in cahoots with the secret service. 
---
Basically everything the brotherhood hates at this point.
---
Did you wake up from a six-week long coma or something lol? Yes, the score unfortunately got rid of individual atom challenges.
---
Yes I do but then again I have hundreds of each type of Stimpack and some Med-X.
---
That's probably true, we didn't get the guy to drop out of the game to check. Our mistake then.
---
Thanks for putting me right.
---
I think the Tattered Field Jacket looks good with the Treasure Hunter hat. But still, need to address the Wrapped cap issue not being able to wear glasses or masks.
---
No but I recently started grinding atoms and was wondering if I could access them
---
Agreed. I prefer live service games like this over single player games now. Destiny, FO76 and No Man Sky are my constant rotation. But yeah FO76 is def my fav Fallout based off the social apsect of having other players. Really enjoy the camp building too and seeing other peoples creations.
---
Oh don’t get me wrong- I really enjoyed it as well. I like the idea of gaining cosmetic rewards like this, I think I just ground myself into the dust trying to get everything in time and I may have rushed myself haha. I hope that you get the captain cosmo power armor - I’m not a big PA user but it’s definitely one of the neatest ones they’ve released
---
Corn soup gang
---
Hahaha good joke!
---
I hope you only Cook the meat with super duper to sell them, weapons deserve to be scraped with the "recycle" perk for materials * about 600 steel
---
Manhunt
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
For your number 3 i think it should be an actual mail box
---
But did the junior pretty only work if you are suffering with the negatives of the addiction or did it work if you are constantly on what ever the addiction is (sorry if that's kinda rambling/incoherent)
---
You are not alone.
---
I have Fallout 1st but don't have tons of concrete and cork, Bethesda just underestimated how much players actually have. Steel, Wood, Cloth? Yeah, most Fallout 1st players like myself would be swimming in that
---
But if you want concrete and cork, you basically have to go looking for it. Everything else you can just happen across while grinding the challenges
---
I took mine out of my CAMP. too time consuming to use,  easier to not pick up or drop on the ground. IMHO I think they did this on purpose as well. They put minimal effort in the and second go around with it as if it was something they were forced into doing so they did a shit job of it.
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/513
---
You have a max of 10k budget. Just checked, flamingos are indeed 20.
---
First World problems...
---
Guild tax. Common for inflation control. Not that this cap inflation can be controlled
---
I wish cross saves were a thing. I bought the game again on PC, but can’t bring myself to do the grind again after I’ve invested so much time and effort on PS4. Lol
---
What about Grafton Dam generates caps?
---
We're the Corn Soups
---
Could be an issue with my game that I don’t get protection and see notices for risking exposure to airborne disease 🤷‍♀️
---
I update my guy ever now and then. The longer he's out there the more scars I add.
---
My Free States members and I use their bunker as our base of operations. Nice group.
---
This is a good thing. Hopefully they’ll bring back a good lever-action skin
---
I do as well but it’s easy to get burnt out quickly doing the same thing over and over again.
---
Raiders and Enclave deserve death
---
They lowered the amount to 15 million.
---
as a cook, i appreciate dirty water
---
for some reason purified water isnt acceptable for my favourite dishes, so i usually have to work the hand pump
---
i agree that it would be frustrating if you had different expectations, but i dont know what you expected from rain in Appalachia
---
Possibly, it depends how generous it is.
---
If we were picking your pockets it wouldn't be 10 percent of crumbs my friend.
---
Tbh A Colossal Problem pissed me off way more. Actually something new to do and they delay it again
---
The man hunt event that is there, gives a very generous 120 cap reward.
---
Thats an expensive trip to the cinema , for me thats double ticket price . Thats pretty interesting to think about. To be fair you are right its not a bad deal its just the fact they priced it differently for different regions annoys me .
---
So do you think the community can donate 200 million cork?
---
I couldn’t do it in one sitting either haha. Glad it worked!
---
Ah ok. I've done the event several times just never noticed that. Thanks for answering.
---
I hear ya! I ended up scrapping mine because of not having the shocks.
---
Never mind Bethesda support is complete dogshit, i can’t even link my Xbox account, and when I look up shit about that problem they don’t have any answers
---
Not a chance! Everything else, *possibly*.
---
They'll have to lower it so we can pass for Cork, like they did with Concrete
---
Something not so huge would be nice.
---
great minds think alike my brother/sista
---
yeah, i try to mix up my path of destruction around the map evry time i server hop, easily gets rid of that problem
---
That's how inflation starts. Plus mules exist for basically that exact reason
---
Something something....games been rigged from the start .......something something........
---
I know but just because life is good doesn't mean it can't get better. Anyway I said shouting into the void but I do enjoy finding out what other regions prices are because I only thought of my immediate neighbours and America.
---
I'll be shocked if it's As good as the mod.
---
This is \*exactly\* how the PC mod works and how I have mine setup. You can name them too! And the PC mod supports up to 12 loadouts (basically the top row of your keyboard; 1 to =)
---
My main has all 12 filled. Some are rare (I've got variants for queen fights, gatling lasers, nuke zone flux harvesting), some I use constantly (heavy weapons, travel, "CAMP"/crafting,) some are hyper specific (1h perk setup with Friendly Fire for Shishkebab healing of Event friendlies)
---
I was on for about 4 hours tonight and besides people launching nukes, there weren't any quality events happening. I mean...I did *Collision Course* ffs. That's how dry it was tonight.
---
They removed a zero from their initial “goal post” on their “tracker site”
---
Just stop throwing your shit away, pointless
---
Nah that’s me. I pick up everything and then forget about it soooo
---
Amen.
---
Ill VATS trash mobs (mole rats etc). When the chips are down I'm getting +10% through 'iron sights' so I'm taking it.
---
they should ad another order of mystery storyline,  especially now that they have nhp's in the game...maybe someone whose name was on the list on the halotapes...they were in a cryo chamber hidden in the mansion....
---
I do know. It’s literally a starter horse.
---
😂
---
Definitely
---
Good one, muh-muh-muh-member
---
Whatever the circumstances, I prefer not to do the same things over and over again in the service of rising numbers. I can't agree.
---
Haha I feel ya. My main has always been a HW/PA build, so I never really used vats. I do have a vats sniper/commando now too, but I've got the freeaim instincts. Gatling Gun makes a fantastic sniper when it comes down to it.
---
Beautiful, thank you
---
I got it lmao, the Quack Doctor has had me hyped since it was leaked. 
---
My rule is, "can I afford to buy two?" but then it can become an excuse lmao 
---
For real though, I was hoping that Hunter bundle would go on sale before it left but ig not 😞
---
It’s one of those countless exploits. Probably won’t get perma banned, considering duper’s got only a few weeks ban and then got back. IMO the glitch where favoriting and equipping the fireworks making you reload super fast is more fun
---
Well, I've never even seen any kind of Bloody Fixers and my nephew is letting me use a Bloodied Handmade. Wish I could get my own but I haven't been that fortunate.
---
The other ship on the board is the timer. It moves 1 space a day. When it reaches the end the season is over.
---
I don't know when the next starts.
---
lol..interesting hey. Specially since you can't physically donate that extra 1 single piece of concrete it went over. The reporting might have something to do with the fact they drastically lowered the target from the orginal though but who knows
---
It gets old. In the end, it gets old. 
---
I have 2200 hours in. Only reason to keep playing is habit. Like smoking.
---
r/Whooosh
---
I have had FO1st for one month now and I literally pick up every piece of junk I see. I leave nothing behind. And after a month, I only have a little over 1,000 each of concrete and cork, which I never use. Absolutely mad how they came up with these donation requirements.
---
It costs $0.00 if you cancel fo1st.
---
i can respect that, thanks for your coment
---
If the limit rises then prices will just increase so we’ll be right back where we started. The best practice for these kinds of games is to throttle the rate at which currency can accumulate (e.g. bullion) and diversify currencies so that certain transactions require specific types of currency.
---
yea
---
woahhhhhh 2200 what level are you  surley 300plus
---
CornSoupGang
---
CornSoupgang...i can rap!
---
I didn't see any rule saying Bethesda couldn't contribute
---
Serious-- take your time, explore, and follow the quests. You'll naturally get a feel for it. Also, don't try to specialise in too many weapons, pick a type you like and stick with it. Stealth rifleman is very forgiving imo and easy to use.
---
I felt the same way about the combat rifle skin not working on the fixer
---
Sounds like a hacked weapon. Probably has massive cyro damage added to it.. Sorry.
---
Cool
---
And I'm level 672...with 3,000 hours in the game play.
---
but there is no way one can immue to stagger? Because I have also equiped stagger, seems he does not stagger at all. why is that? I am using mini gun and such, so firerate is pretty high.
---
Wow thanks!!!!
---
Same, this is bs
---
Do you know The Fixer plan?
---
Exactly my point hahaha. You either learn from other people's mistakes or you learn from your own. Or you don't learn but let's not go there.
---
probably so
---
Most of the new weeklies today were already marked completed before I had a chance to start them.
---
That is definitely not true, legendary enemies always drop legendary loot. The only legendaries that mutate for me are Scorched Beastss and Sheepsquatches. Everything else I kill before they mutate. Does not effect quality of the drop.
---
I got a junkies railway rifle, what were you looking to get for it? I'm open to any offers including caps, and I dont use it so I'm not looking for craziness lol
---
Manhunt. About 10 lvl 10-15 super mutants with one being your target. Kill the target and get xp, 120 caps and random (usually bad) loot
---
Definitely the best side quest pre-Wastelanders. I'm eternally disappointed that they haven't done more with them.
---
It was promoted as a 10 week event, so that would mean it ends on September 8. 
---
Zorbo's game piece will reach the final spot on the 6th or 7th, depending on when it moves for the day.
---
So, one of those days. I would guess the 8th.
---
Def broke. I worked through it after several tries by going private world, reading all terminal entries, analyzing and then putting the fuse in. Doing it on normal server or without reading terminal first did not work
---
I’m about midway through, definitely not finishing.
---
It sucks because it’s not exciting enough to do passionately or even care much about, but it leaves just enough of a nagging feeling if you don’t participate. I’ve tried to only participate when I feel up to it for the most part, but found myself the other day attempting to find some stupid power armor to scrap for the daily (went to 4 spots they usually spawn and no luck), and realized what a stupid chore some of this was. I was totally fine with it early on, do some events  and that’s fine, but it became more and more just stupid little chores, tedious enough to be obnoxious but easy enough to not do, and it just became a slog to get through for garbage rewards.
---
That's just not true. I kill legendary SBs regularly, without letting them mutate and I get legendary drops each time.
---
I have 1250 hours in and I’m 466.  I can’t imagine my level at 2200 hours!
---
And this is part of the reason why I support a SCORE vendor instead of a SCOREboard for the next season.  With a SCORE vendor, we can get the rewards that we want first, ignore the rewards we don't want, and get as many Lunchboxes, Scrip, Bullion, and Fireworks we want.  
---
Most importantly, Atoms would no longer be tied to the SCOREboard so it would be a repeatable challenge like 20,000 SCORE for 150 Atoms.  If someone wants to earn 500,000 SCORE, then they can get 3750 Atoms and whatever rewards they want and if someone only wanted a couple of rewards, then they could play for a week and be done.
---
Dude, it’s not fun. Fuck, man, calm down. What I’m saying is it’s not fun, it’s not interesting. It’s a shitshow and developers should stop shoehorning pvp content into pve rewards. It’s not enjoyable. Especially when you furrow your entire playerbase into competing for a relatively small resource. It sucks. 
---
It’s not about having my cake and eat it too. Christ, gramps, get off your rocking chair about how easy casuals want the game. 
---
People don’t like being forced into pvp for pve rewards.  And a huge amount of people who like collecting outfits, camp stuff, and the like have absolutely no interest in their buggy mess of a battle Royale. And that’s not even starting with the poor bastards on pc. Or should players just suck it up and not get headshotted by hackers for fifteen seconds to pick a lock?
---
Edit: This isn’t intended to be as asshole-ish as it came off. But I am so sick of that “cake and eat it too” bullshit. I play a game to relax and unwind, not being given Bethesda’s “Honey Do” List. It completely sucks the fun out of it, especially considering how much freaking grinding we have to do on this crap. I don’t want to have to pvp and hope I can pick two locks before I get murdered. Because I queue solo because every fucking person bitches the second you queue in a group to do a daily, to Bush Wookiee, or to earn some freaking cosmetics. Which means picking a lock also means I have to hope I am not going to get killed by other people. I’m not complaining about picking two locks. I’m complaining because the entire fucking process around picking those two locks fucking sucks. Just make a daily one “stay in match till the end 0/1” and force people to watch an entire game so I don’t have to spend five freaking minutes staring at annoying loading screens to get a chance to hopefully be done with pvp.
---
No it doesn't make any difference. All drops are RNG in this game, you get what you get and no way to influence it.
---
Participate in as many level appropriate public events as you can and play through the main quests lines. If you do those things you’ll level up pretty quickly and unlock all the game content.
---
Stay on a public building team to increase intelligence to rack up more xp. The more points you invest in intelligence the faster you’ll level up. Maxing out the inspiration perk under charisma will help speed up leveling as well. Brain fungus soup, berry mentats, and brain bombs boost intelligence as well and will speed up leveling.
---
Yeah. So?  If someone you never met just came to your front door, would you hand them a gun and ammo and say welcome to the club?
---
The settlers discuss Pittsburgh a lot, I'd be surprised if it wasn't one of the locations
---
There is a clean American Flag you can get with Tadpole tokens.
---
Yea it’s pretty buggy feelsbadman
---
as far as perk packs are concerned... I am taking those awards with my low character
---
Yup
---
I didn't even realise it gave water til a friend told me. I just thought it looked pretty.
---
Yeah I think that's a better use for them
---
Yup.  And once you proved you weren't just a leech, that you were someone who knew something of survival, combat tactics and had skills that could contribute they welcomed you into their ranks.
---
Do you just grant any stranger who walks up to your door full access to your home?
---
I literally had 249 total. Unreal
---
Oh, and speak for yourself.  I'm a fucking Paladin.
---
judging from that id say nearly 900  dayum
---
It's a very good weapon, make sure you have all big guns related perk, demolition expert, tenderizer and bloody mess, you're supposed to shred things.
---
One of my friends got autocompleted a few weeks ago and he decided to buy a bunch of levels. I tried to tell him to wait because he still had plenty of time to get it just on dailies alone but he went ahead and now he's bored with nothin to do :(
---
I got bored with the SBQ until I got SS Armor &amp; jetpack. I have 3 pieces with AP regen, 2 with -50 fall damage, and two with poison resist. I can literally jump, tap for jetpack, and soar high in the sky. Really fun. And I love those who open lunch boxes because this is my full health build...need the XP boost.
---
I think that would be a lot of fun
---
Look stuff up! Particularly the rarity of clothing items. Can make a lot of caps on stuff you think is garbage. Scrap your junk before storing it into your stash it will help with space in there. There's so much more to tell than anyone can answer over a post like this so try and find a friend online that's high level and use your mic.
---
You’ll have to keep trying the other bartering subs. The mods here don’t allow such posts.
---
Yes actually I do. I was only at like 100 hours before October of last year. I have grinded every season of fortnite. Don’t know why anymore. And I still play all games like last of us 2 on my ps4. How I grind is I wait until my wife and kids go to bed and I play about 4 hours a night sometimes more. It might not be exactly 800 hours but it’s close.
---
It seems to me that sometimes I get servers where things are hopping, just as OP describes.  Then I get server with nada for hour.   If it’s dull, hoppity hop.
---
ah i see.  Thanks for the heads up.
---
No negative effects = no starvation/dehydration = no annoying pop-ups
---
Best of luck.
---
No my vending machine isn’t cool at all. People occasionally buy stuff, but I don’t keep it regularly supplied. Matter of fact, I’ve stopped paying attention to it. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Nice!!!
---
No.  They grow in lots of places.
---
Yes the non-diseased variety.
---
There are some in at least 4 places I can think of off the top of my head.
---
Well if you had a second system then yeah but the original C.A.M.P owner has to invite you to be a room mate, if both characters aren't in the world at the same time it won't work just like with teams.
---
Mules show that there is both a problem with inflation and cap limits. Ease up on the upper cap and watch inflation skyrocket.
---
Not to say that we shouldn't have a cap increase at some stage. Just that there are some fundamental problems with the economy that probably should be addressed before we get to that stage. This game could certainly do with more meaningful cap sinks.
---
Thank you, appreciate it.
---
Well I don’t have any friends that play sadly but thanks for the advice!!!
---
It's not fun.  I never said it was.  I'm saying it's not that hard of a challenge, and takes about 10 mins or less to complete.  
---
I only started out by giving OP a decent place where lots of safes spawn, but now it's devolved into another debate about how fucked certain facets of FO76 can be.
---
I like killing the Mirelurk Queen.

This really is important. Don’t rush. The main quest lines are very important to unlock all the content and help with leveling up. I personally don’t recommend investing in weapon based damage perks early on because you never know what legendaries you’ll get so it’s better to focus on the most diversified weapon perks first (e.g. tank killer, incisor, skeet shooter, scattershot).
---
How can you have two primary effects?
---
It would be cool if they added CAMP stuff to allow you to build a secret crime fighting room. Right now, they are already giving us the fireplace hidden doorway. What if they also gave other crime fighting stuff like: A large crime computer (similar to batman's) or a cork board on the wall with pictures of criminals, maps, and other detective writing. They could add a special crime fighting radio or a large OOM symbol to place on the floor.
---
Every time I’ve needed to mod for lightweight armor, I just picked up a few golf balls at Bolton Greens or the Whitespring and called it a day
---
To be fair, people didn’t buy RDR2 for an online game, people got 100% of their money’s worth.
---
You can't. You'd be only getting the extra damage from taking adrenal reaction
---
This isn’t a great event for someone your level because you’ll probably die a lot. Most of the scorch will be maxed level and could probably kill you in one or two hits.
---
There’s a concrete collecting event challenge with the BOS at the moment and this BOS vendor is selling it in bulk
---
You forgot about the floater grenades, to sear the memory of the time you wasted out of your head.
---
Well, there goes that theory  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ .
---
You can sit this challenge out if you don’t like it. There’s enough daily challenges to complete the run. Just because you find it less fun than other people do it doesn’t mean the devs should take it off from everyone.
---
So vampire low health rifleman
---
Hmm.  Maybe.
---
Obviously you'd do a lot less damage, but you'd be quite a bit tankier.
---
I mixed those with Nukashine and am preparing for the buzz of a lifetime.
---
Thanks. If there’s one thing I’ve learned working for a social game company, it’s that people engage with video games for all kinds of reasons!
---
I've gotten good use out of this already for when I get caught stealing from unlocked workshop resource generators.
---
I give back what I steal if I'm caught.
---
I respectfully disagree. Some outfits are a bit meh, yes. But most are pretty awesome.
---
I had a TS fatman until yesterday. A level 1 pipe pistol hits harder.
---

---
Ehhh I wouldn’t say blood eagle stuff is raider stuff. They’re pretty different
---
I'm a fan of nukes... On top of them. What I'm trying to say is I'm going to nuke them.... With nukes.
---
I don't mind in general. The last couple of days, I've been running either SBQs and events, or did resupply/restock runs and I've levelled up like crazy. (Difficulty: Level 201 now.)  
---
Sometimes, I enjoy the mindlessness of farming supplies and killing enemies. I especially enjoy it after a long week at work or an emotionally draining day. Melting Ghouls and Scorched sometimes helps. And it's cheaper than the therapy that insurance won't cover.
---
The TFJ looks great with a scout mask and medical goggles.
---
Which horse is the fastest?
---
I've been using a Vampires shotgun with my Bloodied build. Works like a dream, especially since they fixed the health buff/speed demon regen bug. Vampire weapons are going to become a meta back up weapon for low health builds soon enough.
---
I have friends on xbone that I don't play with so I can use my PC mods
---
The spooky tree was one of my most favorite rewards. Definitely stick it out for the tree- it’s really neat honestly, especially if you have a raider or cultist style camp
---
Childhood gamer, then I discovered the opposite sex. Patriotism followed (USAF) war.
---
Marriage and kid.  New civilian career became  video gamer again with my son. Nearing retirement and a empty nester. Too much time now to game. (PC) The passion never left...
---
lol!
---
I just started the Run, returning player. i'm at 14 so far. trying to get as deep as i can before it runs out. i know i can't complete it, but im trying.
---
its fun to have various challenges to work for logging in. i already completed most of the weeklys
---
Lol "dupped" awe someone doesnt know how to farm correctly 😥😪
---
Yeah it’s a lot better at the beginning for sure but it slowly takes more score to level each time. But I hope you at least get a few rewards that you like :) good luck!
---
OMG -- an actual Pinata skin for death bags would be AWESOME
---
Sorry I have a hard time understanding this, Like the pip light doesn’t turn on when you have the quack mask on?
---
Exactly, the game is total garbage in several aspects, playing together is quite literally the only saving grace. I guess I don’t understand why you wouldn’t want a level playing field of experiencing it together, those close shaves are what’s fun. If it’s too grindy to play the story again how are you stomaching the constant and dull grind of dailies and repeatables?
---
I mean, if y’all are enjoying it then that’s all that matters. I just don’t see the value in not making a new character if you’re going to co-op through the whole thing anyway.
---
This too. A trash weapon on one build is a godroll for another.
---
Yes, the high capacity backpack reduces your overall resistances as the cost of the extra carry capacity.
---
Go with the raider or settler backpck mods instead, like the other commentors have said s the net benefit is much much better
---
very true my friend, hope your doing ok
---
DITTO!  5K SCORE just gone.  Pfffffft.  I logged in almost 3 hours after the weekly reset.  Didn't have any crashes recently or other of the anecdotal causes people are spewing about.  First time the bug has hit me.
---
I logged in 2.5 hrs after the reset and got hit with the bug.
---
You do you, I’m a get in get out cranberry forager
---
I thought for sure there'd be an NPC to take up the mantle of the Mistress of Mysteries. But, That was us, I guess. Still, it would've made for a great mini women-only-faction.
---
I too completed the run today without buying levels. Your completely right it been a hard slog and totally not worth it. But im a collector and can't let free stuff do to waste.
---
I truly hated fortnite when it came out. I downloaded it being it was free and new and I said I don’t like kid looking games. And it was almost 1 year of it being out I gave it a try and it was something different but it’s to stale now and I love story based games. As why I love fallout games. Fallout 76 has me hooked, and there are nights I get bored but I still grind almost everyday. I just enjoy it, I do have a hell of a back log and this is how I always was. If I get into a online game I push all other games to the side. I have so many games where I started but didn’t finish it’s ridiculous. Lol but just how I’m two years I’m still learning new stuff and new builds excite me. And I’m just glad they didn’t give up on it once they had all that hate at the beginning.
---
Opinions, people have different opinions to keep in mind. I find the majority of outfits at least fashionable so its just not your preference.
---
Thanks! nothing on the path seems like a "must have" for me, so im not stressing it. Well the ammo converter seems important but i have that already lol
---
I just enjoy the daily challenges working towards a goal aspect. I dunno its fun to log in and care about doing those.
---
Had a guy like that once, then I noticed his power door had been left open so I walked in and turned off his whole base.
---
Walk in the front door, quietly pick up a  desk fan then run away with it.
---
Pricing 10% higher still stiffs you out of some caps. You actually need to increase the price by a little over 11% to get your asking price after Bethesda takes their cut.
---
The daily atoms and weekly atoms should have never been taken out, the legendary run should have just added and not replaced.
---
The impostor has a fire trail that follows it. You’re probably taking fire damage just from being nearby.
---
one way they could improve on the mod would be to allow you to tie a load out to a specific weapon such that when you switch to that weapon you switch to that load out
---
as a peasant without a scrapbox, i support the scrapbox skin initiative. Everything has skins, why not that?
---
I'm alright. It's really just stress relief and for the most part, my stress is low right now.
---
It's on the road map and the devs talked about it a bit at QuakeCon
---
Like Strong Back?
---
This is exactly what happened today. I expect it on Thursdays at noon EST. But, I wish that they would post it to the community forum BEFORE they apply a fix to new worlds, not an hour after we all have lost our stuff.
---
You finish WEEKS early then drama queen how hard the grind is.
---
Christ.
---
I feel this too hard
---
The problem is the rifleman part. Too slow for vampiric.
---
If you mean Commando, that's a little better but still not that great. You will always underperform vs a heavy variant due to lower fire rate and ammo capacity.
---
That might still be enough to be interesting but those frequent reloads could be brutal at the wrong moment.
---
thats good to hear my  friend
---
Maybe a option between perk packs or like 150 atoms
---
That nest prefab is the closest thing to raider I got lol. Although they do name every totem, "mothmans..." too
---
I’m not trying to be a drama queen but I’m sorry if it came off that way at all? But if you read thru the thread being done without buying out levels is certainly not the norm- most people at at least 20 levels from finishing and already burned out just from doing dailies and not even going for the NW rewards. In no way am I saying that it’s impossible - just hoping that the system can be improved upon for next time! &lt;3
---
Yes. Everyone.
---
I feel like that would really be a non choice as not many are going to choose a perk pack over atoms but maybe other options like boullion vs atoms or caps etc
---
Same for shotgun shells.
---
I got to tier 60, realized I wanted to play the game instead of logging on to just do some hyper-focused challenge, bought the last 40 tiers and now I’m free to do what I want. Right now I’m rebuilding my camp and it’s my best one yet!
---
Also yes... I bought tiers. Trust me it’s worth it if you have a little spare money. You feel so liberated lol
---
I’d choose a perk pack, as I’m not level 500, so it’d be useful
---
Fair enough :) the options would be good so people could choose what is most useful for them
---
They took away the weekly challenges which was bad enough. Nothing pleases some people
---
It’s was just discounted on PS4
---
All of the outfits look cool in the shop but most look meh in game.
---
Sadly the outfits I want don't seem to even be in the shop.
---
Yeah that’s totally valid- building is one of my favorite things too. I was really happy to place the little star lamp in the spot I made for it tonight. And yeah I just don’t have the spare cash sadly. I’ve only been able to get fallout 1st like twice and one of those are because my friend got me a gift card haha &lt;3
---
You finished weeks early.  YOU DID IT TO YOURSELF.  Quit whining.
---
I could agree with that honestly. I would really like them to add new world challenges too
---
What sucks the most is if you Uninstall the game on Xbox your pictures are just gone
---
everytime i return to the game i often take breaks from it, i delete and restart my character (endgame grind bores me). But while my various characters are different i like to add scars and make them look more waste landy as time goes on. adds immersion for me.
---
I'm just trying to figure why they went with such a reset system as opposed to a universal time. Like every day at 0000.
---
I don't have time to constantly grind- three kids, 6-7 day work weeks and a divorce- so I bought the whole board. Maybe I'm weak but eh. The atoms were just sitting there in my account.
---
Yeah it is fun. That’s what I miss about the atom dailies because I always felt like I was working toward something even if it wasn’t something I knew about haha. I like saving my atoms for things that I must have!! I had enough saved to get the blood eagle nest today :)
---
I played through solo. And because of that, there were a lot of spots that were discouraging and annoying because it felt like I was being punished for being alone. From basically lvl 55 to 90, it really felt this way. Adding to that, this whole S.C.O.R.E. thing has really driven that into the ground. Until she started playing I honestly would only hop on for maybe an hour or two a day.
---
By running with her, it allows me to experience that fun again that I had without all the bad, back in the beginning. On top of that I wouldn't be able to rescue her as much as I have to right now if I was the same level as her with next to no inventory. This is her first shooter and her first fallout game, and I don't want her to be discouraged by the tediousness of some parts of this. That said, I'm not holding her hand through everything.
---
Haha same. I hope these items will be exclusive or I will be the big sad
---
Try to pick up xbox game pass or ultimate on a deal, isn't it on there still? If it is, I always get offered for both of those for a dollar for a month
---
That 1 extra cork was up Russell's butt the whole time.
---
I think it dies indeed punish branching out and forces you to sometimes scrap things you use if you want any decent yield (the animated cards) I think they should either get rid of the scrapping system or make it so that you get a lot more points from doing so for it not to be as oppressive.
---
If you are at 84, you probably don't have to do much score grinding. Don't forget there are the weekly tasks. There are seven right? One for each day of the week, add one weekly to all your dailies and that should allow you to rank up at least seven spaces in a week (they just won't happen day by day.)  You should be able to hit 100 by the time the run ends without extra score grinding.
---
Keep in mind we have meat week, which requires we kill a lot of enemies to get meat.  I'm 88 and from now on I plan on just focusing on the weekly tasks and then finishing the run during meat week.
---
And then I'm sure we will get that double score and extra daily events too.
---
Only thing I'd suggest is possibly using power user in intelligence &amp; drop 3 points of gunsmith. But with or without that change, it's a pretty solid build. If your not using explosive, so you won't have to repair as often. More fusion core charge means less weight &amp; then you can also throw in a gatling laser as well with double ammo capacity due to power user.
---
Blocker is a must. If you are going to use a gatling laser/UGL power user will double your ammo.
---
Yeah it was 40$, I’m looking to pick it up for 20$ or less
---
I currently wear the surgical mask at all times I'm unable to appropriately distance from others while teaming up in wastelanders.
---
Well if only Xbox game pass existed on PlayStation lol
---
That makes more sense, how long have you consecutively been playing? Literally since launch? I feel for you if that’s the case, it seems Bethesda drops the ball pretty regularly even this far in. We did about a month last summer then did 2 months this summer. Of course, my wife has played games all her life and we started together with black ops 2, then all of destiny until D2Y2.
---
yeah you are right. I just want to keep that nice 10-11 square buffer I have between me and Zoltan and I also kinda just want to get the thing over and done with. Im burning out though so I probably will take the foot off the pedal a bit. I'll definitely finish with ease either way
---
So probably switch out something like Lock and Load for Blocker? I was thinking of using a Gatling Gun and .50 Cal for my weapons, how are they compared to the Gatling Laser or UGL?
---
1 legendary rank perk upgrade = 100 coins = 100 perk cards = 100 levels is my incentive to keep playing : )
---
Go to nukes and dragon to pick a build dont want to have to respec later
---
Yes it’s a terrible idea. It will randomly punish you for opening card packs since certain cards get deleted when there’s a duplicate, and completing the stupid challenge to level up a perk card wastes a potential point as well. 
---
If they go through with it, you can be certain that they do not give two shits about the community and just want people grinding their asses off, because all everyone has done so far is tell them how bad this system is.
---
They should double the reward amounts on all dailies/weeklies or if that feels too much change the repeatable to 1000 instead of 100.  It’s silly literally designing something where your players have to log in every day pretty much to complete it.  We have lives, we like to do other things and play other games.  The reason people are feeling burnt out is because of the level of time investment.  If someone logs in on the weekends and maybe does one week days worth of dailies it should be enough to hit cap by end imo.
---
Florida? you poor dear, be safe.
---
Understandable. Is outworld on Playstation at all? I guess it was just a timed exclusive then. Ah well, either way I am glad that soon xbox plans on not having any exclusives.
---
Probably a good idea since I am already swimming in advanced repair kits. Thanks.
---
The day isnt over yet. The updating of the tally isnt done until later. Im not sure what time exactly because Im in Australia but it hasnt changed until I check in the morning for all of them. It was still on concrete last night my time
---
Gatling gun for every day farming &amp; 50cal for events, probably the best mix.
---
They're so easy to complete though.  Boring, but that describes the whole game.
---
Given how much time is left you would be able to get those 8 ranks with less than 2 minutes a day chewing bubble gum, buying from player vendors and taking a photo.
---
If you consider that a grind, why the ever living fuck are you even playing?
---
For the moment gunsmith is apparently dead weight as people have reported no difference with it and without it, so maybe consider an alternative in the short term as a replacement.
---
What heavy weapon you go for kind of affects what perks you might go with. 
---
For instance, power user is good for energy gatlings. 
---
Also, you may not need to devote that much to lock and load if you have very high capacity mags or using a gatling gun where you're not shooting a full mag during an encounter most of the time. If you're a bit smart with how you pace combat, reload time usually isn't that critical. I'd personally prefer blocker over lock and load.
---
You might want to consider subbing in tenderiser for travel agent as that little bit helps when you're in combat and you only really need travel agent for say if you're doing vendor hopping or travelling large distances.
---
Russel isn't bos. He's trying to get their attention
---
this is why i can't friend settlers they are all veggie shits....
---
carnivore or nothing baby! cannibalism ok too
---
I saw shotgun shells for 8 each
---
Oh sure, as a returning player ive certainly noticed my normal atom growth be very slow.
---
Yes, it's true. But temper your expectations - They won't be full open worldspaces like Appalachia.
---
i just entered chapter 3 today, i'm kinda donezo isn't?
---
Yeah it’s available on PlayStation, and honestly I don’t remember it being a timed exclusive I think it released on all platforms in the same time. However, it was EGS exclusive for pc
---
Played RDR/O from day one, tons of fun. quit, played FO76, from beta. Just loaded RDO 2 weeks ago, Spawned in, got shot in the head re-spawned, found my horse beside me, while trying to remember how to get on horse someone rammed my horse killing it, and as I was standing there looking at horse they ran over and killed me. ALL Within 4 mins. I kid you not. turned it off and deleted it off console
---
I spent 10 bucks and got something else instead, oh well if I finish the legendary run I can go ahead and get it later. I got the tires and mothman cultist sign (Ultimate badass raider thing I think, a decapitated body that says "Abandon Hope", I mean, come on!)
---
My camp looks like a literal junk yard now I just need some of the in game camp items to tie it together, looking at you meat piles.
---
Good idea :p
---
I taking hour before and after reset. Just to be safe(and its working), Its frystrating and exhausting. (11 pm reset time there)
---
I'd donate but I don't have enough cork and I need it for more important things than a few stimpaks and a bottle of booze.
---
Ahhh. I just remembered that it was one of the games that they put on Gamepass at launch, and they had just promised to put all xbox exclusive games on it when they first launched.
---
Well I'm sure they'll learn their lesson from all you guys rewarding this behaviour with money.
---
Is it blody?
---
So if I'm planning to use the Gatling Gun and .50 Cal, Power User might not be as important? I'm also going to switch over for Blocker as that seems to be a highly recommended perk.
---
Nah we gotta wait until patch 22 to get the item in our inventory, wait till patch 23 to equip it and then wait until patch 24 for the stats to work. Maybe if we are nice we get the fix where it won’t crash our game Around patch 25/26...
---
Sounds great! Trying it first thing tomorrow. Server Hop machine gun.
---
this is why I take screenshots, upload to Xbox live and then save them on my phone/hard drive. there were some I haven't saved however :(
---
old atoms challenges and on top of that i want also to gain something for my donations.
---
like 5 scrips, 2 treasury notes and 50 caps would be a deal to donate my stuff but sadly dupers would get more benefits than us... we can't just get good things T_T
---
Todd: WHAT HAVE YOU DONE??
---
Players: I blueprinted a machi-
---
Todd: THAT'S ILLEGAL!!
---
Players: oh sorry . I thought It was part of the mechanic and-
---
Toad: YOU'RE BREAKING MY GAME!
---
Players: maybe fix your GA-
---
Toad: I'LL FUCK UP YOUR DOUBLE WALL!
---
Players: Sorry master...
---
Not bloody enough, if you ask me.
---
You see, all they really needed all along was caps, but they knew they couldn't just demand we give them our hard earned currency, hence the 'you're helping us' campaign. 
---
We're 'helping' them alright, helping them get stinking rich off our resources! Amazon warehouses in the Apocalypse, stocked by us but run by them...
---
What level are you?
---
Congrats on that! I’m currently at 83 and like this reward system (for the most part that is) especially since it’s all free compared to other battle passes. I just wish they hadn’t removed our daily and weekly atom challenges. For the next one they should put them back and have SCORE rewarded along with it. They wouldn’t even need to have atoms as a pass reward either if they put them back
---
Yeah that makes sense then, I thought I was tripping because I don’t remember it being a timed exclusive lol
---
They cannot.  People are going to whine no matter what they do.
---
They are literally giving people free shit and people are whining.
---
It's un fucking believable.
---
Just wondering if I could get some rare plans for cheap lol
---
If you drop it or trade to anyone the name reverts to standard.
---
I donated 250, so there should be at least that 😂😂
---
How dare they give me free stuff!  WHAAAAA!
---
What I do on Xbox is this: View a picture in the gallery, press A I think it is to hide the UI, then take a screenshot. Then it's saved in your Xbox account. Then you can delete it from the Fallout picture gallery. Not ideal but it's a way to not lose your pictures.
---
Swap blocker in for lock and load. Adrenaline I found personally useless when being a heavy gunner maybe keep one point move 3 over to endurance and get the life perk 9 health is 9 health. Ditch one gun army for sure swap over to power user it will save a lot of farm time and double ammo gat lasers (personally use a Junkies 2590 ultracite gatling on my nerd build) . Personally I always take 1 point in tenderizer for 5% flat increase.   
---
OH and make sure to run emergency protocol on your PA it is mandatory to run this kind of build correctly,  avoid empath unless you always play with the same people if you do and you both have empath then you are damn close to immortal. I only play the bloodied PA build with my son we both have empath and yeah I think I die only from stupidity can't remember the last time a mob killed me with this build.   
---
Otherwise you are looking good.
---
Xbox actually offers better deals esp. with gamepass. You get so much bang for your buck, also fo76 is having a new influx of players because of it, its been quite fun helping newbies out.
---
I would have donated but my main only has 212 cork.
---
Sinks everywhere
---
Yeah, helps explain why there are mutants everywhere beyond California!
---
If you are level 20 or higher you should have done the excavator quest and just crafted the power armor.
---
I mean... I can't even...
---
Yeah but like... WHO in West Virginia is pocketing those caps? I understand the mechanic and why it's in place, but they never tried giving us even a hand wave lore explanation as to who or why the tax is in place.
---
I’m not whining - I really enjoyed the legendary run but that doesn’t mean that I don’t think it could be less of a grind. I would love some new things to do to give score. I think having events offer some score would have been really helpful in that regard. But it seems you’re more interested in just pointing fingers like a child than having any meaningful conversation so have a good one dude :)
---
I've been playing since it came to steam. So I've only got about 300h in. I stayed away for the longest time as there weren't any good reviews about it, and finally decided to pull the trigger as it completed my fallout collection in steam. Game Pass was what finally allowed me to convince my wife to try it. 
---
That said, a lot of people don't realize how toxic the PC environment is. You hear all these amazing stories and every single one of them are console. Well we are on PC. That's something else that I don't want her to experience a lot of, as I can handle it as I used to be an Eve online player, but she's fresh to all this.
---
Dont se the point tho, almost all ammo scarce, only one you dont use are growing up, nukes and rokets goes to trash,
---
Then we have converter and producer, and i gues its should satisfy all your needs(tho cant say for sure), even without them, i buy ammo only just for daily score...
---
And after playing, i just cant price anything high, its either some newbie who cant yet farm plans etc, or some vets who dont want your overpriced trash...
---
*2c is fair imo*
---
Yeah they should give players more perk card packs to compensate or let players choose a free legendary card every 25 levels starting with 50 or something, Another idea would be to allow legendaries to drop from perk cards packs themselves.
---
Finally someone with the guts to help
---
Good job man, I'm at 95 once I finish the only reason I'll be loging on will be to grind out gold
---
I enjoy any item with passive productivity...or whatever it would be called. Just go about your day and pick them up whenever you're at camp. Definitely a casual item but quicker than pumpin'
---
That's because the moment you take it out of the shop it gets soaked and/or sprayed with grease. Gotta make it super shiny so it looks extra horrid with the new lighting mechanics.
---
You can’t even what? Realize people didn’t want to give up mats when they’re free and only nets a few worthless points in the season? I have all the power armor I need, does me nothing but waste resources to craft, 2 locations were nearby and 2 others cost a few caps to get to. But that was still time wasted for something that doesn’t do much of anything, I didn’t say it was complicated, I’m saying it’s boring, do you really get a kick out of crafting 3 power armor needlessly? I’d rather it be one actually challenging item per day than a bunch of stupid little mindless tasks (ie chores).
---
pay to not win!
---
as far as i know the only way to get purified water is with a noisy machine or crafting but it works for recipies when you boil them ;O
---
Hell even rainwater in heavily polluted areas become toxic! Imagine what shit it wouldve picked up after soaking up all the stuff left by the bombs!
---
Agreed. There is usually one at the Pen, one at the mansion, one under the houses near the middle of the map. Pick an area, go straight to the safe, if someone is picking it, kill them while they pick or let them kill you and try again. It took me two matches.
---
&gt;What I’m saying is it’s not fun, it’s not interesting. 
---
I didn't do it.
---
You don't have to do it.
---
Why are you whining about it?
---
Seriously, why the fuck do you feel so entitled that they're giving you free stuff and you're whining about it?
---
The community is worse than the bugs.
---
My Lady Death sniper is being RPed as a member of the Order. She wears her veil all the time!
---
I don’t have FO1, my birthday was a few days ago so I was gifted a gift card which I used to finish up my run. But congrats for doing it all legit man!!
---
Oh well thx for insuring me
---
You can just do your best man.
---
The 'spot' at the end of the questline actually allowed me to place a camp down. I was rather shocked given the nature of it. Thought about constructing a memorial but ultimately didn't want to ruin the experience for others having my camp there.
---
I think one day I'll just spam them till I have a whole bunch then just have a camp full of them in displays. Have on right now on display.
---
Honestly that's what the So Sorry emote looks like. The last frame it ends on looks intended for trolling.
---
Shouldn't even be needed, the cards shouldn't have been the design in the first place.  It's just pointless swapping that there is no reason for.
---
I need more girly stuff tbh
---
You’re so close- you got this!
---
This char is 101 so it'll get 3 Legendary Perks when they eventually come out right?  
---
I have both of those recipes.
---
You must be really bored to spend all of your time commenting childish remarks that aren’t even in the spirit of my post :)
---
I gave her the Garb to wear and she didn't even say a word about it! ;p
---
I do keep Super Duper equip almost all the time these days. So. Much. Meat.
---
I usually sell weapons/armor until I hit the cap limit and then I will scrap it if I need some.  But I'm not a FO1st person, so I rarely need much.  I dump a LOT of stuff into that little sack by station's tinker bench.
---
That's what I've been doing.  
---
I do have a short friend's list in the game. The only other person I know that loves Fallout as much as I do HATES online, co-op, and pvp. He doesn't have a PS4 or PC good enough to run it.
---
I log in for about 20-30minutes each evening and quickly burn through the dailies. I'm used to MMO dailies, so that doesn't really bug me as much.
---
I price all my ultracite ammo at two. Fight me.
---
Yeah used to be able to get some atoms every day but it’s much more limited now
---
Replied to a similar post earlier today with the same sentiments. Really hope next season awards SCORE for completing events instead of just dailies/weeklies and forcing the player the log in every day, it's not healthy.
---
You only get 1 though.  It's not enough to really matter.  You're not going to farm 250 pipe weapons in any reasonable time.
---
I whole-heartedly agree with this sentiment. That would free up some room for different rewards! I would love even skins- like new skins for our work benches and things like that
---
Nice!! And Happy Birthday!!
---
Refreshing to see a post not complaining for once and just enjoying the game
---
Yeah its stupid, I went to apply it to the one decent Fixer I've gotten so far (TS-FFR) &amp; was reminded they haven't addressed this yet. Goofy as hell.
---
Its normally 4 ranks so it would be 20% 40% 60% 80% but yeah
---
Yeah it’s not as bad as some like the reputation grinds in WOW but I was much more dedicated and I didn’t have a full time job back then either.
---
If you're PS4 you can take mine I don't want it lol
---
Just wait till the last week. There might be another "double" challenge weekends coming so you may save up some atoms.
---
And then they leave the cork donation goal at 200,000,000.  They don’t learn,  not in any timely sense at least.
---
That's fair. I still play WoW, and SWTOR, so I keep up with my grind quota😅
---
Yeah I would like to see more options - especially for people who can’t play during the week because of work and things like that. It would be nice if events or things like that also gave score
---
But having a perk that does that is weird. That should be something in the base game
---
They autocomplete it at this point....
---
They know they screw it, and they at least NEED to progress building itself... 
---
Just imagine BOS will go back after see all the dissaray.
---
But less of a waste of perk points
---
I'd be more upset that it's not available if I actually liked the dark matter skin... But I don't.  It's  just dark gray and boring.
---
This gives me an interesting idea for a daily that wouldn't be so much of a 'fetch quest' that has us being ordered around by a nobody.
---
To start out, you rescue a surviving member of the order that had traveled north, or to the Pitt etc. They were coming back and got kidnapped. You rescue them 'wearing the garb' and they declare that you must be the new Mistress. 
---
For the daily, have the quest start by accessing 'your' terminal in the Head Mistresses office. Here you cans select 'Urgent mission' and read a bit about something going down in the area that you assigned the survivor to take care of. Upon exiting the terminal you'll be greeted by the survivor you rescued, she tells you that she can't do this alone and needs your help. You then set out to beat the boss raider alongside them, or rescue the trapped settler etc.
---
i believe you can stack them yourself. Better in theory for everything but the camp budget.
---
Oh man the grind is strong!! I do miss it- my guild fell apart years and years ago and now I don’t have a good computer to play. I was never really more than a casual in wow tho.
---
Well Cork comes from Golf balls....
---
So likely golf
---
It's a terrible system imo. I want to be able to swap builds every now and then and for that i need alot of different perks with various ranks. By the looks of it i will get the stealth damage perk and then rest will be the ones that gives specials. And dump my excess cards on the stealth damage thingy first, and then just have rank 1 special ones.
---
And the must have looking ammo crafting perk will be maxed on my alt, making him a ammo factory.
---
Maxed Blocker is a must for pretty much every build..
---
Ignoring 45% incoming melee damage is huge in this game...
---
I donated 8 collections of steel.
---
I donated 3 collections of concrete.
---
And so far 1 collection of cork.
---
It’s a system made for us to grind levels &amp; keep playing; different servers w/ harder enemies that give enough experience for high level players that is locked by gear skill cap would be nice
---
I'm tired, had to read your first sentence a few times to get that you're not a cannibal.
---
If it held 10 dirty water it would be a bit better.
---
So, who thinks there will now be a hot fix patch and then everything drops cork.
---
Like them faschnat intestines.
---
We’re just all traumatized Animal Crossing veterans having to pony up most of the donations for things ourselves.
---
they said they'll "look into it" already lol
---
BFA had a lot of deserved bad rap, but the story was amazing for me, and I had a ton of fun as a new player. SWTOR will always have a special place for me. Probably the MMO with the most progressive systems I've seen.
---
It usually updates around 11am CST for me. Has anyone seen the banner in their ATX?
---
Or buys a ton of atoms? Or doesn’t 😉
---
There's a timer on it. If someone in that server has done it recently it won't allow you to activate it but unfortunately there is no way of known how much longer the timer is. Try server hopping.
---
There is an armor mod that reduces incoming staggers. I can’t remember what it’s called.
---
It was too much like work, after week 2.
---
That does sound nice indeed, having dedicated areas with enemys that are actually high level not just around 60
---
Shine your flashlight on them, see if they turn into real items
---
Which is just dumb. 
---
  
---
Costs me $13 USD.... which is $18 AUD... but they charge you guys $23 AUD... thats some bullshit price gouging
---
Even so, this group is independent of the Enclave, even the wiki mentions it
---
Don’t do this soll or low level!
---
This will start one of the hardest bossfights ingame called encrypted! Do so with at least 3 friends or with a open team!
---
Twoshot. Explosive weapons still gaining 100% dmg buff from ts, bring your repair kits tho 🙄
---
I was surprised they didn’t make an ever upwards pioneer scouts flag
---
Nice youtube clickbating tactic from a fresh reddit account. You did this exact same thing/post yesterday. 
---
EDIT: Awwww you now removed the yesterdays poooost noooo...
---
Dont use two shot gauss shotgun? Got you
---
Being a fan of both hurts
---
Are you aware of the term "schadenfreude?"
---
Sounds like you only know them from F4 and only the parts you want from F76.
---
I have heard about the idea of "scaling but its nowhere on any road map, so  I guess maybe in year or two, lol.
---
Luck of the draw perk should help with the gun breaking. When I use shotguns it seems to repair itself very often
---
Grenade launchers are good for line in the sand, when someone abuse tent spawn, so easy to tag.
---
Ooooo okay good one thanks!!
---
Yes i need this.
---
I think I found a winner
---
That’s why it’s good
---
It is on the roadmap it is supposed to be released with steel dawn going by it, it's the "one wasteland" thing but I don't think it'll let enemys scale up that much
---
No, ty. There is enough laser or plasma explosive users, they melt queen already, even more than magic weps
---
Yea him and cordless vii are in my opinion the best fo76 builders
---
I grab them in Hemlock Holms when I'm farming acid tbh.
---
You could never bulk screws unfortunately
---
I'll take a look at cordless. Good luck and tnx
---
Better at what exactly?
---
Made me smile, thanks
---
Maybe it just me, but i never had that bug, lvl 81 already, always logging out like 10 min before reset (PC)
---
It’s so broken error 0x20010006 is my life over there
---
Addictol, antibiotics, disease cures... I sell all of these very vital things.
---
LMG is so fun to use but .308 is so goddamn expensive I dont bother with it
---
I know exactly what event you’re talking about. Those bots are new. They didn’t used to appear there.
---
Those are from tech data the t60 base plans are from maps
---
You still have some time. Get as far as you can/are willing to!
---
&lt;3 don't be mad tin man
---
Oh nice, maybe I misunderstood that. ooo I wish it will be scaling above level 60 lol.
---
Its fine it just most ppl dont like or bother with PvP.
---
You do you though as long as you're enjoying the game
---
Now if they would look into making the Jack'o lantern skin being applied to the fixer then we're in business.
---
true
---
I feel like Fallout 76 is a proving ground for bad ideas. 
---
"Should we attempt to have the community try to collect 200 Million pieces of cork scrap?"
---
"Sounds like a bad idea."
---
"Let's do it and see how bad of an idea it really is!"
---
"It's gonna be horrible, just like that one idea you had with the limited dialogue and repeating it every 10 seconds!"
---
"I feel like, it's almost as bad as the Atom Shop Standees at train stations, or cancelling the Survival servers.."
---
If u spawn kill the legendary b4 they mutate, u get nothing.
---
I nuked Atlas tonight
---
I wonder if given the Enclave's current situation they would consider a truce of sorts? We've given up our claim to Grafton damn, and we don't have any interest in claiming White Springs, so our ambitions are not at crossed purposes.  Perhaps it's time for a new strategy.  Go to the Enclave commander and tell them that the Brotherhood is willing to put aside its hostilities for the time being.  Further, tell them that we are willing to send troops in their coming defense of White Springs bunker.  My guess is that they're in no position to refuse.
---
My personal bartender and fuckboi Beckett would disagree with you.
---
If they asked for collection of screws. And doesnt hit the desired 150million. The meme on them within their office would be "we r screwed"
---
Boysac...? Lol gross.
---
What a dirty paedophile.
---
I didn’t. And I don’t plan to. 
---
I’m commenting in a discussion thread about an interest of mine. 
---
Why are you in here fucking complaining about people discussing the literal main post? You don’t have anything better to do than whine about bugs and people complaining?

It’s not exactly easy to get to the guaranteed spawn item. Especially for people not leveled for it.

I don’t find it less fun. It’s not fun at all. And I didn’t do it. I don’t plan to. I’m merely relating my opinion on a discussion topic. Feel free to do the same somewhere else if you don’t like. I think there’s a lock pick challenge on nw you could go do.
---
Holy shit, I've never seen so much corn soup lmao
---
If you genuinely enjoy something and that makes other people mad- they're just being entitled assholes. 
---
Not much different than being a "Karen" imo. Instead of "I'm going to get you fired" it's "I'm going to boycott this fandom and send death threats to all who are involved. Also gonna harrass any fans because the world has to revolve around what kind of game or movie *I* think is good."
---
Enjoy your shit and don't worry about what other people think.
---
I’ll wear it, but only if you come help me kill a wendigo with me.
---
Flatwoods has Agri center for easy spot. Another just south of Slocum Joes. 
---
Morgantown Trainyard is a great spot. Another just south of Pioneer Scout Camp, in a boat. Two others in the camp itself, one near Scout Leader’s position, another by the building with the canoe on top. Lots of spot.
---
Not necessarily. I have finished that quest asking for one to be slain at Freddy’s House of Scares as well as the church in The Mire.
---
Yeah, reported for self-promotion
---
Never had that bug, i always log before reset, 81 on main account and lvl 69 (nice) on mule account. I dunno wtf u have to do to get it regulary. Im on pc
---
Me

Get your clickbaiting ass outta here

Oh god, you just made me realize that we’re basically playing Animal Crossing: Appalachia
---
Those raiders sound like domesticated pussies to me. I love when they tell me to not get ahead of myself, that I’m not one of them. They get pistol whipped and taken out like the dog they are.
---
It’s like they’re in a race with Foundation on who can be the biggest target when The Brotherhood of Steel come back to gank everyone’s goodies.
---
How much does it hold?  I figured it would be dirty water and got it just so I wouldn't have to pump when I need that random 1 dirty water.
---
Hell yea. If this was a real perk I could slowly start ditching WWR armor.
---
Those legendary perks maan. Got to get on the grind b4 it starts. My only incentive to leveling up.
---
U do know that it doesn’t matter the limit inflation will kill it all the time. Like most time u can buy with caps worth anything u pay 30k so if max was 100k u would just pay thay
---
Goes to Todd. He also gets all the lost items from bags and everything you never meant to scrip or scrap.
---
I just want them to make it how it used to be, and I could invite someone to team without accidentally fast traveling.
---
Dude RDO was physically painful to play. For all the bugs and disconnects, they didn't have shit on RDO. Sometimes it would take me 10-15 time outs to log in, start a mission, get booted, 10-15 times, start mission again, get attacked by a posse trolling people, get booted. 
---
It had some great mechanics but God was it so unfun to play sometimes.
---
Or crafting - both my gauntlets (one bloodied, one instigating) have faster swing speed
---
Pneumatic mod
---
I just tried this and it did not work.  On another note, it that Todd Howard on the right in the picture above the Terminal?
---
I just unlocked the monkey backpack so I should be able to finish this run at least.
---
I don't feel its really a grind as I can do the daily challenges in under 10 minutes usually.
---
The nuclear winter ones need to go.
---
Taking a picture or placing a camp are easy but picking locks or killing 3 players are to much time consumption.
---
Oh yes the order of mysteries was one of the best quest. I also liked the continuation in F3 we listened to the radio stories, in F4 we pretended to be the silver shroud and now we learned the Mistress of Mystery was real or became real and her sad fate. 
---
Also, look another BoS is bad post yawn.
---
My blueprint includes only the double sided wall/ double sided door frame. It did work when I placed it though. I didn't include anything else in the blueprint and it worked just fine even with a floor and roof in place. Maybe you have wires blocking the way?

When someone new joins the server, an event pops up if none is up at the moment.

Also encryptid and scorched earth is activated

If you can hack the terminal at the jail to get into the med centre there’s a static spawn addictol there.
---
Yeah the moment I knew I was done is when I logged on and tried to do a bounty, the bounty led me straight down an ultra steep ravine, I lost the bounty, my horse and a played chased me down just to shoot me in the back. 
---
I'm like yeah, without griefing this game is nothing. No thanks.
---
Considering there’s a side quest involving Grafton Dam, I doubt Bethesda would want to touch it.
---
I’m going to take a different direction than the others and suggest you just fill in your map wherever you can. You’ll get incidental XP, and some SCORE, and might trigger side/daily quests you don’t currently know about. Then, these will be useful for when you’re later on wanting to fast travel all around the place.
---
My first and only run through capped out at 28 hours only missing a few side quests. 
---
The game was woefully underwhelming, and clearly got a big bump from the Fallout killer hype train. Even the subreddit dedicated to it slowed to a crawl shortly after launch. 
---
The most common false praise it gets is that it's "Fallout in Space" it isn't. It misses the mark on many of the core elements you expect from a fallout game, and it avoided many critiques because of it's hype. 
---
Problems it suffers from:
---
* Short. 30 hours is a solid RPG experience sure, but there's little beyond generic fetch side quests to stretch that out. 
---
* Weak, non existent exploration. It's not open world, I get that. The presence of interesting/unique locations to explore is not only lacking, it's entirely absent. Even the area's you explore on any given planet are repetitive and just not interesting. Occasionally you'll come across a "location" which is the same few generic buildings, with repetitive interiors and a few bad guys. The next "location will be the same....and the one after that...and the one after that. 
---
*Enemies are boring, lack motivations, and are basically made up of uninspired sci-fi creatures and extremely generic "raiders"
---
*The weapon pool is EXTREMELY shallow. There's maybe what 10 weapons in the game (aside from a few gimmicky science weapons)? Literally like 10 weapons. As you progress you just start finding Pistol Mk2.... Sniper rifle mk3.... Which are all identical to their predecessors with slightly better stats. 
---
* The mod pool for weapons/armour is equally shallow, and borderline pointless. There's so few mods, they should have just tacked them onto weapons as effects when they drop. 
---
* The aid pool is excessively bloated. 84746 items that all share a small pool of effects. 
---
* Builds are almost pointless. For real. Pointless. You can spec into almost anything and be just fine..... Except....
---
* Speech. This is where this game gets so much unwarranted praise (more on that later)  You can play OW as a talker or a fighter. The problem is that if you take the combat approach you're presented with a significantly less satisfying, less robust experience. A speech play through is more dynamic, more interesting, more satisfying. Combat engagements quickly bleed into one another and become repetitive. 
---
* The writing in the game is not as good as people make it out to be. One liners, quips that lack creativity, and pretty generic dialogue. 
---
* The game relies HEAVILY on Easter eggs and homages. While playing OW around every corner you will find nods, references, homages and Easter eggs to everything....that isn't OW. The first few are cool....then it loses its charm. 
---
* Areas, cities, places, and building don't feel lived in. They feature wildly repetitive interiors and tell no stories about the occupants or people who live there. Add that to never needing to return to anywhere meaningful in the game and you never develop an attachment to the setting or anywhere in it. You show up, do some stuff....leave and never come back. 
---
* Companions are not interesting lack clear motivations (aside from the Vicar, who I would have liked to saw more development from). As the game progresses you'll quickly ask yourself "Why are these people even here?" Even when there's interesting story hooks like Pavarti's family situation... They don't explore it....
---
* The game is blatently front loaded. After the halfway point in the game you'll find yourself whisked rather quickly through less fleshed out locations until you reach the end of the game. 
---
* If you've played previous Fallout games, early in the game you'll be completing a part of the main story line, and you'll swear to god that you've done this exact same quest line, with the exact same options before. You have. An early major quest is straight up recycled from a Fallout game....
---
* The game very heavily, very liberally "borrows" from other sci fi works. Notably Firefly. Beyond Easter eggs. Firefly fans will very quickly notice a ton of very familiar ideas and people. OW isn't Fallout in space. It's a less inspired, less compelling video game adaptation of Firefly. 
---
* ..... And probably the most disappointing thing in the entire experience ... Shallow, pointless choices disguised as important and a lack of consequences. In most cases the game will hold your hand and give you multiple chances to force an interaction to go your way. It's near impossible to have an interaction not result in the way you want it to. Like wise with the sneaking aspect of the game. Get caught somewhere you shouldn't be? Bribe a guard. Or threaten them. They just go away. And you can just do it again.... Most importantly every "important decision" you make in game ultimately plays a minor, insignificant role in the end game. 
---
* The survival mode is tacked on and poorly executed. To make up for a lack of tension they make companions perma die... That's like the only thing you really worry about. Keeping companions alive..... 
---
* The faction reputation system was a wasted opportunity and amounted to little more than a price modifier when buying things. 
---
There's probably a bunch more I've simply forgotten. I had pretty high expectations of OW, but I quickly faded into being just an above average experience. A decent but not amazing first forray into a new IP. There's potential there though. 
---
Ultimately it felt like it really showed off what Obsidian does well. Make great games in other IPs. 
---
Though, Grounded has been pretty spectacular. I've been far more impressed with its early access, being much more memorable and interesting than its finished "Fallout killer" OW .
---
..the Chosen One
---
I'm not sure but I think it's still a good practice to place one on either end of a garden so that it is the first target a mob will target due to line of sight. Fences help protect crops in this aspect as well since they are longer. If you can distract an enemy long enough in this way then it could give your turrets time to lock on as they have a few second delay after gaining line of sight themselves.
---
I think the scarecrows are advantageous in this aspect since they have a small build place area, yet a large hit box to absorb damage.
---
I have a theory that sony releases consoles with high boot speeds to botch speed tests only to be later updated to below xbox speeds. not to mention the controllers being a total moneyhole because of the non replaceable integrated batteries. I also don’t support sony because they push for platform division, microsoft has been making a lot of the steps in the right direction in that regard.
---
thank u!
---
Oh that’s a pipe dream
---
If you like cottages, I would find someplace in a wooded area with lots of foliage. (Use mutfruit for garden)
---
Use brick, as most cottages are masonry. (Although shutters would be cute.)
---
Gable roofs, perpendicular gables are a bit tricky.
---
(Wish we could use a higher pitched roof)
---
I would try doing a story and a half for maximum coziness. 
---
Floor plan can be square or more dynamic.
---
Supermutants can be tough for the level.  Aim for the head.
---
Or...get the Professional Drinker perk, collect all the corn, collect all the wheat over at Billings Homestead, collect all the wood at the unmarked house across the street, make all the booze of your choice, and drink to your heart's content! :3
---
The hangover is probably gonna be nuts.
---
Honestly, farming ghouls, mutants, and scorchbeasts after a long day warms my cold, dead soul just a wee bit.
---
&gt; Red dead 2 was a single player masterpiece
---
No it isn't, not even close. You're easily impressed if you think that's masterpiece level. Or you've never read a book.
---
RDO is pretty garbage and you're in here trying to scold people for fanboying while you simultaneously fan boy.
---
Speaking of the Gauntlet, what reputation do you unlock that from foundation? I’ve sided with raiders for my other builds but I’m probably going to side with foundation for my unarmed build just so I can buy the gauntlet faster. But idk if it matters since I’m pretty sure you can buy it pretty quick.
---
Quantum spamming. People accuse me of hacking all the time but 3-5 quantums restore my health bar pretty quickly.
---
I think Atlas will be their "Foundation" or "Crater."  I doubt there will be much else that changes.
---
Mine can't be transferred to my stash. I mean... It may be like that for everyone I never asked. But mine can't go in my stash.
---
If it's like this for everyone I'm gonna feel stupid.
---
I forgot what Radcliffe said, but for me Jen want to adventures with my character someday
---
Nah this happens a lot with certain dialogue choices, the same thing happened to me. Don’t worry, when you head back to Foundation after the quest Jen’s mom is there, and you can interact with her. I’m not entirely sure about Digger, though. I haven’t been able to find him for some reason.
---
Friendly IIRC?
---
I guess that explains why I’ve never gotten one with swing speed lol. And my other builds use guns so I’ve never really bought melee weapons at the purveyor to test it for myself.
---
Absurdly bad idea that people keep bringing up like some turd floating to the top of the punch bowl.
---
This just punishes you for not grinding out all 100 ranks in the first week.
---
Just awful.
---
And then everyone stood up and clapped. 🥳🤡
---
I have laughed so hard at that picture! It's great!
---
Going through this thread, I'm starting to wonder if I'm the only player with a massive corn farm who uses it exclusively for veggie starch and booze...
---
They gave you more actual content, lots of free outfits and skins.
---
Why hoard all the caps. People hoard caps and then go around saying "caps are worthless". The are other things to use as currency. 5.56 ammo I'd quite often used in trades. Technically speaking, you could keep 400,000 rounds before you reach your stash limit. Most players have them for 1c each. Invest in ammo. 
---
Afraid you're going to accidentally use your currency? In an apocalyptic wasteland, knowledge is valuable . Buy mutations serum recipes. Trade them for high price items, or learn them and craft mutation serums to sell when you're short on caps. 
---
From an immersion perspective, there is no central bank, meaning you're not writing a check for 30,000 caps, but rather physically carrying 30,000 bottle caps and counting them out one by one when you buy something. From a gameplay perspective, this is not gta; don't make this like gta.

---
Well there's my full health pa heavy gunner build. It's not set up for stealth, but I do run vamps 90% of the time, then pull out my junkies guns for big fights.
---
I don't know how well a stealth heavy will work, I know harpoons and flamers are the only silent heavy weapons.
---
I do shread without stealth though haha
---
Build a wall, build a flame trap, destroy the wall, build the second wall, repair the 1st wall.
---
I have 5 characters between 120 and 200, and erased other characters too (maybe 200 levels combined). But leveling up gets slower and slower at 200, and I start a new toon when that happens. 
---
People with 2200 hours and a single character are level 700-1000 depending on style (I fool around a lot, don't grind XP).
---
I miss them actually doing anything worth a damn like in the previous Fallout games.
---
I mean, it was your own fault. Just pay attention to what you scrap
---
Damn it I spent an hour looking for vendors selling serums... was hitting camps that had a bunch of Stims...
---
sigh, at least I know what to look for in the future
---
And now we're getting different free stuff, like OP fireworks, lunchboxes and perk cards.  All of which are better than atoms because atoms let you buy useless cosmetics for dressing up your virtual barbie while lunchboxes etc. actually impact the game.
---
Any explosive will kill your stealth.
---
Yeah buddie.
---
That skin is why I still use my combat rifle. Full heavy combat decked out in pumpkin. Glowing skeleton hood. Ghillie backpack. Combat pumpkin rifle
---
Agree with all of this, I actually stopped playing after about 15 hours because I was just doing the same thing and getting the same weapons
---
If the only thing keeping you in the game is free cosmetics for your virtual barbie..  buh bye.
---
Completed it about a month ago, great quest. It's as fun as Last Voyage of the U.S.S. Constitution and The Silver Shroud from Fallout 4.
---
I’ve scrapped much more valuable stuff than that by accident. It happens.
---
There was no game update today.
---
Take a break from the game.  I’m not trying to be a dick, but that’s what I’m doing when I hit level 100.
---
This has been an issue for a long while.
---
Quack mask?
---
I have several hundred hours in RDO and it crashed twice. Also Fallout 76 - 200hours, two crashes because of a lost connection.
---
If your AAA titles crash it's mostly because you use WLAN, AMD or a low quality PSU.
---
(pcmasterrace since 1993)
---
Another thing is for the taking photos of stuff for the challenges like animals you can kill stuff then take the picture and it still counts
---
Ah... yeah. That's precisely what I said.
---
I have a feeling I'm gonna be evicted from yet another pre-fab house.
---
If a friend stays on YOUR private server, you cannot rejoin said server. It will put you on a different private server.
---
Death threats?
---
It sucks cuz I was wanting to apologize to someone I ran into again for something I did a week ago but choked up and don’t say anything in mic..
---
And now I have the very tool that could’ve helped, just after it’s use is lost
---
Faster than the well bucket too.
---
Drive down there &amp; tell them you want to leave, but the fast travel bug is stopping you.
---
Power user is definitely not important in that case if you're sticking with ballistics.
---
I  don't know if Bethesda is making a conscious effort to demoralize their most dedicated players, or if they are just ignorant about what's in their own game because they  don't play it.  I'm guessing that it's the latter.
---
Is there any way to rearrange emote wheel? I’ve got some of them as purchased in Atom shop but not in the game.
---
I'm currently only at level 66 (I think? I know I haven't hit 70 yet) and hoping I can finish without spending atoms. It seems silly but I feel a need to finish it because I've put so much into it the last month (I had taken an extended break from 76 and only started playing again a month ago). It almost broke me when I saw my reward was a photo mode frame.
---
Good luck! It’s rough, you should look there!
---
One Enclave, One America. Now and forever.
---
I usually b-line straight to the rough anyways. I’m a natural I guess
---
  *to infinity and beyond* ?
---
Barely at level 67, I can still level up one or twice a day. It's great when I only have to spend 20 minutes a day, but most of the time it's pretty tiring. I've done most daily quests, haven't bothered much with grinding for XP. I missed a lot early on due to not joining teams and not going after legendary enemies.
---
I'm just waiting for more double SCORE days as I'll miss about a week of SCORE. I haven't even used any of the items I've claimed.
---
Well I learned increate is actually a word /shrug
---
Yeah, I took time two or theee times when I’ve felt overwhelmed and it really helps you a lot to love the game again and be better when you come back.
---
&gt; They said "cant give back lost items because of "tool limitations" 
---
That basically means you're not worth the effort.
---
You could point out all the instances where they have returned items to players and point out their hypocrisy and lies but is it honestly worth it?
---
That's pretty awesome.  I took an alt to 50 pretty much with explosive weapon at Line in the Sand and auto-completing Vital Equipment.  Might be hard to register enough damage with a level 1 though.
---
I personally don't like the Fixer because of it's stupid recoil but the Handmade is just a weapon of wet dreams. No recoil and insane damage(You could run a non-legendary and it would still pack a punch).
---
Edit: Before anyone here comments. Yes. I know that the Fixer has higher damage than the Handmade. No. I still prefer the Handmade when aiming manually.
---
I know they changed it and many people already said this, buy fucking hell, what were they thinking making  the most rare resource of them all to be 200,000,000. I would understand steel,  but cork.. Only proves again that they don't play their own game, otherwise they'd know it.
---
I’ve been running a non-legendary for a few days now and I’m dying for one already
---
R.i.p Pearly Peepers 🔭
---
I got max rep yesterday and I began playing the week after wastelanders came out. Also didn't do the dailies (or even play) every single day. 
---
It will only take 6 months if you reallllly take your time with it.
---
I downloaded a mod that replaced the fixer skin with the dark matter skin until they patch it in
---
It worked. yay
---
People who overprice easily findable unique items are the same people who put Workbench plans in their store for 800 caps banking on someone bored or gullible enough to buy it.
---
Fixer has faster movement speed while sneaking.  It's almost as fast as walking while not sneaking.  So a Fixer and a Chinese stealth suit is just amazing.
---
What platform ?
---
I agree. OW got a lot circle jerking pre and post release. I got bored and never even finished it.
---
I'm glad you're enjoying the game, and I hope you can maintain that enjoyment! I've been playing on and off since beta, and it's really difficult for me to not feel like Bethesda just treats the damn thing like a cash cow -- feeding it (and us) scraps off the table.
---
herbivore has more ap and perception boosting recipies where carnivore has more melee damage and strength recipies
---
Fixer and its movement speed + stealth isn't bad. I used to hate it. Slowly being converted to it...
---
OP both these guns are cracking good. If you get either you're.
---
Insider info I've found .45 slightly harder to maintain than 5.56 so if you're a shit aim use the HM.
---
Because somewhere in Austin there is a bunch of devs that needs to learn to make games.
---
Are you playing on PC? I could throw an instigating one at ya
---
I need to make a blueprint.
---
Wish I had known this. I had 4,990 Bullion, went to turn in 20 Treasury Notes and got 10 Bullion. No message saying I wouldn't get the full 200 because I was near my limit. So that's 19 Treasury Notes wasted. Definitely not happy.
---
This was brought up before and someone gave an interesting answer. It's a technical issue carry over from Fallout 4. Any craftable item recipe means it has its own unique item. So if you wanted to make corn soup or something, you'd have two recipes to every item that could feasibly interchange Purified and Boiled water. The game engine isn't very versatile.
---
It wasn't that bad, I thought I'd have to play two games but found two safes in under ten minutes. Was also able to down three players, kill a ghoul and a Scorched Grafton Monster, and have my Adventure player level up.
---
Agreed, but I think Bethesda would screw it up somehow.
---
For what it's worth, it's lightweight junk.
---
Might make for a nice conversation piece on a display stand.
---
Okay. What is a pearly peeper?
---
PC has no market at all really, stuff is duped or exploited to hell and back,I havnt sold a single round of ammo in months even 5.56 just sits there.
---
i LOVE the unique experience that only an open world multiplayer can bring. between fallout 76, rust, and dayz standalone/arma mods, i get more than my fair share of an apocalypse fix. the bugs and grind and toxicity don't bother me. i love the idea of permanence and world building too much.
---
There was a point in time where I had a massive field of corn, tatos, and mutfruits and made vegetable starch all day long, but eventually your adhesive situation sorts itself out and you can get on to other things.
---
If any of the spaces left are atoms, you will get back what you spend on those (if you buy)
---
I found a pristine accordion somewhere once long ago and it's been sitting in my stash forever just waiting for the Thanksgiving shelf to return. Was so excited when I saw it this morning, instant buy. 
---
Then... as usual I got distracted in game and completely forgot to add it to my camp. ;p
---
Looks really nice. Just be sure to take out “one man army” or use “one man army” appropriately for the queen to let her land &amp; spawn scorched enemies for more experience
---
There's actually quite a few on the putting greens
---
Nvm that, it's a costume from blood eagle bundle. I think you can purchase it separately too.
---
Just use the zipper. Works every time. It's not that hard to use when you figure it out. Should still be patched of course, but it sounds like they're working on that, so until then that's all ya really gotta do
---
If you use gun runner, action boy and marathoner you can probably cover twice as much distance in the first minute. That means twice as much gear.
---
Playing on PC
---
Requires the advanced power connectors and the basic small rug/mat.
---
[Here's a tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp3TOm48m8E)

As long as I get the fireplace I’m happy
---
I started 7Days to Die recently and if there was a way to combine these two, I'd turn off IRL haha
---
A special pair of binoculars that function as a recon scope.
---
if you focus you can find people selling it. bought a spare for 1k some months ago.
---
I literally had two 'magic' rolls at the purveyor.
---
Furious FFR plasma rifle and 2Shot 50%limb plasma rifle. Modded both weapons to flamer barrel and tested. First time I have melted a SBQ in seconds lol.
---
I worked in f2p gaming and I do see some patterns, but I'm glad it's worth the purchase just for the solo-explore content
---
What platform are you on?
---
Member, you're about half a day late.
---
If you want to reduce your weight while farming scrap, it’s actually perfect. It satisfies both hunger and thirst and if it’s about to go bad, you can sell it at a vendor. Not to mention it’s very cost effective to make if you keep a farm.
---
I’m in Aus, so please forgive me 😔
---
With ~~the BOS~~ an unconnected fanboy.
---
I tend to play in 'stages'
---
Starting out I'm in a ramshackle shack barely being held together with duct tape and wires. 
---
As I assert more control over my surroundings I update to more spacious digs, with more amenities but still feels apocalyptic. 
---
Endgame I transition to being a local king basically, with a really well built base furnished with all the pristine equipment and furniture I've been able to scavenge. Living it up at the end of the world style.
---
Yeah. There are limitations like you cant use turrets/traps, and cant interact with anything (so switches exist, but you cant switch them).
---
You can make some nice WTF moments though - I made a forest of deathclaw bushes for someone to wander into.
---
Generally its probably a good idea to build it out of NW, and blueprint it. You dont want to be caught mid build.
---
I...I don’t get it
---
I mean... where have you been? Death threats is a very common internet reaction to discontent. I'm sure 90% aren't sincere, but it only takes one pscho to take it too far. Case in point, Christina Grimmie, Selena, and others who were killed by their own fans.

I bought it yesterday and now I’m super dissapointed. My camp is on a LAKE! I have all the dirty water in the world!
---
You are forgiven, member.
---
(You've used up 1 of your 3 strikes.)
---
Do you mean your mask?
---
Does it work on combat shotguns? It’d be kind of weird if not.
---
Same. As a high health hybrid build,I'll max the stealth damage right away ,then go for extra points in PER and AGI. The other 3 will may be for utilty,like the piclocj/hacker one.
---
Come on, Sac. Leave this shit be. Sinister and I have already settled this in private.
---
That'd be very helpful. I've been camp hopping looking for a certain plan, but it seems like every camp I visit just has dozens of Santa Crashes and mounted heads.
---
It crashes at the most challenging times seriously
---
Fargo vibes
---
Starts next week.
---
Thank you I couldn't find any were that told me
---
I've only found one and have been looking for more! I usually listen to podcasts while I game so these tapes are right up my alley.
---
I apply atomic shop paints for the same reason.  My guns tend to have names, but armor is always labeled boring things like SSRA SSLA etc.
---
right? every game i play seems to fall short where another thrives, haha. 7 days is still something i need to get into. played it way early on and kinda abandoned it for rust. i get it confused with miscreated a lot for some reason.
---
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but all the people sending you friend requests appear to be zombies....
---
As a McCree main in Overwatch I agree.
---
&gt;  the atmosphere and lore has gone out the window, 
---
How about you read the terminals lol?
---
Can you calm down or did you shit your diaper?
---
Game is easy enough as it is with out giving everyone god roll weapons and armor. Would probably kill endgame more then help it. Would be pretty boring not having upgrades to hunt down. But I do agree the current system is very limiting and hinders game play to an extent. Hate the fact that there is nothing to do with legendaries after I get tomorrows script limit other then leave them to save stash space.
---
Just as an alternative for discussion. Use the slot machines for gear from the wayward quest. 
---
1star legendary would give a coin
---
2 star legendary would give 1 star coin
---
3 stars would give a 2 star coin
---
10 coins would equal a 1 star coin
---
10 1 stars would equal a 2 star coin
---
10 2 star coins would equal a 3 star coin
---
This would still keep it random effects while allowing choice as in rifles or pistols not just ranged. And give you something to do with all the legendary pieces you get beyond the script limit. As well as keep the difficulty of 3 stars higher. Could even put a limit on usage of each machine daily or weekly if needed.
---
As much as I would love more effects. Think it would be better to adjust current effects and add more perks to create synergies similar to bloody. For example a perk that would buff the player for unsurpressed addictions. Fix mutated to buff per mutation and add a perk while at full health all mutations are enhanced both the positive and negative effects. 
---
Pets are a good idea. 
---
Simple fix for events. When people enter an event area there added to an event group that shares exp and loot so long as they remain in the event area. Think raids from other games.
---
Don't forget the flash grenade ;D
---
I use to enjoy the game like you, then I took an arrow in the knee.
---
I totally feel you on that! The Appalachian wasteland offers a lot for exploring, and recent story expansions are well written and have some really entertaining moments. 
---
However, that of course does run out (rather quickly in my opinion), and some people grind things to be motivated to continue to play the game... But Bethesda with it's RNG for certain crafting, it's constant inability to deal with dupers, and just weird things that are severely tied to how old the engine is -- just really make the game a bummer to play sometimes -- unless if you can find unique ways to be motivated to play... Like -- griefing (unfortunately). But even that can also be tied to Bethesda's axing of PVP servers. 
---
People have been wondering why FO76 isn't completely f2p for a while because of the money they make from the market and fallout 1st subs. There are also some subscription promises they haven't delivered on, and while there can be little sparkles of things that make you say, "wow, the devs most really love this game." Something also happens that can make you say, "wow, ***Bethesda*** must really not give a shit about this game, or us."
---
I did that, twice, maybe even 3 times. Still waiting for those atoms for a month if not two xD I figured they're not gonna bother..
---
I mean, the rain is kind of irradiated.
---
Sorry about losing your balls. hopefully someone recovered your bag and donated it for the cause
---
Same here, Jennifer Connelly crush and everything. I figured it out by the third leg. Also cleared level 100 on the run today.
---
Yeah, now, we need "f$%k off" one...
---
I stumbled upon a gauss rifle last night,  so I thought tonight I could pretty much kick anything’s ass under a level 50. Well, I encounter a level 42 diseased glowing wendigo near Burning Mine. Even with some point blank body shots, that damn wendigo proceeds to shove that gauss rifle right up my backside.
---
I just spent an entire day trying to hunt for cork. Between the two golf courses and the pipe rifles i only found enough for half a turn in. This event could have been a nice experience but so far seems like they want it as painful as possible. Anyone have any tips on where to find cork in an efficient way, because I'm about to just quit trying to farm it. Server scrolling and going through 5000 5mm rounds for basically no reward isn't fun.
---
Im pretty sure class freak makes it like -12% energy dmg. You can completely negate it for an hr by using grounded serums. Serums sell for 300-500ea, or you can make them yourself after buying the recipe.
---
If they added brotherhood troops and turrets but keep the event, it could be even better.
---
trainyard in Morgantown, yellow responders boxes, one in a little tower on the south end, one in the tall tower, and one inside a shipping container in the NE corner. you should always be able to pick all 3.
---
Was booted this afternoon, right before finishing "Scorched Earth", so I feel ya.
---
Go to the gym in the Morgantown highschool, I promise you'll have a field day
---
Well ya never know when they're gonna ask for 100 million adhesive...
---
Ah yes. Enclave group meeting. Now all we need is a Gordon Ramsay emote to signal other players to:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-wNQZV6HzQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-wNQZV6HzQ)
---
They don't want people getting as many free Atoms as before, they want people to spend more on the shop while hoping people will feel like the Season rewards are worth the tradeoff.
---
I've been aging my character as I level. Cool little added immersion.
---
Old man winter effigy is a bonfire style unit, I think it might have an old man winter mask on it, but not entirely sure on that.
---
It's only for sale from other players, and it drops for free from the Fasnacht event.
---
So, the price is whatever people are selling for, and whatever other people are willing to pay.  I may have one still, if you're interested and have something interesting to trade for it.
---
I usually use my lever but on high hp mobs the handmade and fixer do more damage because the faster fire rate and bigger magazine. I like the feel of   the handmade better but also.dont have a bloody fixer yet to give the fixer a real chance.
---
Strange how everyone has been calling the perk packs useless when we all know we’re gonna need every spare perk card we can get once Legendary perks drop
---
Ammo factory exploit! Jk the wallpapers are pretty awesome.
---
They were also pretty nice for me cause I started a brand new build pretty shortly before Patch 60
---
&gt; rdr is still sitting in its cellophane wrapper.
---
That physically pains me to hear.
---
It's literally my favorite game now, story and ambiance wise.
---
\^ this, but I can find around 100 on a WS that hasn't already been picked over, without much effort.  Or I used to...the ones near the tennis court might be gone since they (inexplicably) moved the pickup that used to be parked there.
---
Click drink then spam collect.
---
You're welcome
---
Agree. I look for plans I do not know every day and I tend to only visit camps that sell 100+ plans so that there is bigger chance of me not having some known.
---
i’m very glad you didn’t lose your lmg for that!!
---
Same never has happened to me at all, and I've been on as it reset and Not a single one of mine so far has Auto completed
---
Yep, got the “server not responding” message a couple of different times tonight, while in a work bench. Two times I got dropped
---
Edit... not necessarily really bad lag, but I believe lag is what caused my notifications
---
Did you finish it by only doing weeklys and daily’s or did you complete the repeatable 10,000 XP quest over and over again? (I’m new and trying to finish it tier 64)
---
Yeah that's what a buddy told me but I can't confirm that anywhere. I know a year + ago people all said empath and grounded aren't affected by class freak. And yeah I know I got like 8 mutations. If I see it for sale and under 500 caps I'll definitely nab it
---
Yeah, still not there, and still no explanation.
---
I had 2k spare cork since I never use it.  Got me 8 atlas boxes and got nothing but alcohol and grenades from them. No wonder people don't want to help for the "rewards"
---
Where?
---
Being most the way through a silo.... happened to me today.
---
"A rocket?"
---
"Yeah, like in the comic books."
---
Hotfix today added them
---
That’s a rad idea.
---
I swear I heard that last week
---
my experience from working in gaming says that you are probably right on both accounts. The devs and dev team probably really care about the games but business expectations set by corporate could push the game managers to questionable practices - sometimes directly by higher-ups.
---
I feel you. I love 76. I'm mostly an Xbox guy. I really enjoy movies people hate (looking at you, Star Wars). 
---
But, in the end... I don't get mad when people rip the stuff I love. Take Star Wars for example. I've REALLY taken a deep dive in to the new canon. Seen all 3 movies several times and haven't missed any of the books. I'm having a great time with it. 
---
My Xbox, especially when paired with FO76, provides me and my wife with endless hours of entertainment and bonding. Sure, my PS4 and PC also provide entertainment, but most of my gaming is done on the ol trusty Xbox. 
---
People wanna hate on the things we love, let em. To me, they're just missing out on simply ENJOYING things.
---
I picked up deep pockets for my secret service armor 2 days ago.  I thought the problem was fixed.
---
Still no “thanks”?!?
---
I just imagined it was on the equipment itself and sent out intermittent pulses.
---
It really is a shame. There is a game company in Estonia that's been working on a game set to be released for the PS5, and there devs had a mass exodus because management just didn't respect them. 
---
But it can be difficult to walk away from something you're passionate about, or when you need to eat... Any number of things.
---
chicken coop
---
There needs to be a revenge storyline against the cutthroat raiders. Maybe that douche Brody and company are still alive and need to be exterminated. Something with a super irony twist where he gets betrayed.
---
I was just annoyed that the costume couldn't be worn over armor. I have too much crap to run around without my 5 pieces of reduced weapon weight gear.
---
That SouthSeas Club dress ... (whistle).
---
Me too man,  me too,  lost all motivation honestly,  really don’t want to deal with that kid again,  it’s alright the first time round but I definitely don’t want to do it again.
---
Then why comment if you don't know what you're on about?
---
I was a rifleman until I decided to try commando. I will never go back. I carry both fixer and handmade. Furious explosive fixer, mutants explosive handmade, switch between 45 and 556 depending on which I have more ammo for.
---
I got some on PS4 you can have. Whilst cool I just bring my Rifle to my face and I've got all the zoom I need.
---
Or 100 million corn ... Settler/Farmer event?
---
The best way to enjoy fallout is to throw out 76 and replay new Vegas for the 23rd time
---
no
---
Delete the game
---
god i think i posted on the wrong sub
---
Current fixer paint makes me wonder if it was originally going to be part of an Arktos Pharma themed package.  I personally like it, but would certainly love to apply dark matter / halloween skins to keep me from accidentally scripping them
---
With the fireworks glitch, lock and load could be a waste. If you don't know about it it's when hju equip the trail fireworks from the legendary run your gun reloads ridiculously fast. If you've got spare fireworks that's your lock and load but way better. :)
---
Nah actually tho. The game (atleast in my experience) is only fun when you have someone to play it with. Playing alone is better set for another fallout game. The only thing 76 has that other games don't is multiplayer
---
Got eem.
---
I know haha. But I often switch weapons in battle and can't re equip the fireworks
---
Honestly I’m among the few that welcomed the NW challenges because I do also enjoy playing that mode so I am glad we got rewards for playing it. Maybe next time there could be an option where you could either choose which your “extra” daily would be - NW or adventure - that way those of us who do enjoy NW could still do so.
---
Oh yeah that’s a sad feeling. I hope you’re able to complete it tho! Good luck to you :)
---
Find some friends &amp; play together &amp; if your under level 50, it gets a lot easier once your a bit higher level.
---
Just kidding but if you wanna enjoy it don't fast travel all that much and maybe get some inspiration from other camp builders to build your own beautiful camp. That's what I do atleast.
---
I use 4 pieces weapon weight reduction (80%) and 1 chameleon piece (stealth sniper) I can cash out my daily caps with 1 run through WestTek by selling the guns/meat you get.  If I didn't need chameleon, I'd be running 5 pieces of weapon weight reduction.  Unlimited weapon carry? Or does it max out at 80? As it is now, I carry 6 rifles at all times when exploring for every circumstance (zealot's  lever,  troubleshooter's lever, exterminator's handmade,  instigating crossbow, executioner's radium rifle and an instigating Gauss rifle (monster damage).  If I'm on a resource run, I'll just take my crossbow and executioner's radium rifle.
---
I have multiple weapon weight reduction left arms/left legs/chest pieces. But super hard to find right sided weapon reduction armor for some reason. My other two main builds only have 60% because I cannot find more right sided armor to get them up to 80% l'll keep looking though...
---
Nice thing is it reduces ALL weapon weights, so I don't have to drop  heavy weapons, and shotguns due to their weight. It's a hard to find effect on armor, so I collect every instance I find and scour vendors for them.
---
Same. I'm really enjoying it, as a mid - level player at this point. I dislike 3 and really don't like NV, but the exploration and worlds of the last two have been great. 76 is a strange beast. What infects this sub has a way of distorting the game (grinding, going for legendaries all the time). I entreat you to soak in the world, poke around and explore. The loudness of some parts drowns out the rest, if you let it.
---
Thank you, and congrats!
---
How much does your weight increase with the mod? Not really sure it’s worth removing my sleek mod for it tho
---
Huh?
---
It would take away the need for people to purchase atoms, servers cost money to maintain. Additional content costs money. Money is why. As for what purpose doing the challenges after completing the legendary run is...there isn't a purpose. You can play without worrying about that grind. But now that we know what kind of challenges to expect for the next season, save that bubblegum. Remember where you killed those 3 deathclaws. Save some prewar food and alcohol.
---
Yeah the double XP weekend really helped push us past the halfway mark. We spent the entire weekend just grinding and server hopping for the big events like radiation rumble and line in the sand etc to try to farm as much as we could
---
Eh, the Appalachian food connoisseur understands that radiation sickness is secondary to flavor! 
---
Everyone knows purifying water removes all the yummy minerals. Cooking with purified water might produce a meal with no rads, but it also makes it rather bland and unappetizing in the process. 
---
Since we can easily cure radiation sickness with a simple radaway... we chose to ensure flavorful dishes remain a staple. ;p
---
I have my CAMP at the base of Grafton Dam, and I love having a bunch of mutant neighbors to slaughter whenever I want. Recently installed the artillery cannon on my roof to deal with them when I don't want to head up to the dam. The only part I hate is when they all line up at the dam railing and take potshots at my dam(n) crops.
---
Lol that was mine- I'm glad it worked in cheering you up I felt we all needed it :)
---
Better yet, make it a nukashine for the first time it's used after a storm.
---
I hope you reach it! It’s really neat. My camp is... well not really a building per se haha so I can’t use it yet but soon!!
---
I end up doing that event multiple times a day, because my CAMP is right at the base of the dam and spawning into it starts the event for me.
---
&gt; My camp is on a LAKE!
---
Then why did you need a rain water collector? 
---
Admit it, you bought it because it looks cool. The function thus becomes superflous. ;p
---
Grieffers, block them! Or better yet, stay in your private server, that's what I do
---
When it happened to me I was just simply sleeping in my bed. When I messaged the guy and asked why he was doing it, "lol bc it's fun." Was the exact response I got.
---
Yeah that seems to be people’s worry although I have so.. so many perk packs at this point just from double xp weekends etc but i didn’t think about that not being the case for everyone.
---
Dam buddies! high five!
---
I was doing all weekly and daily and grinding the repeatable as much as I could stand - the double XP weekend happened to fall on my birthday so I had that Thursday -Sunday off work so that definitely gave me a huge boost
---
?
---
No. I am stupid and thought it would collect purified water. :D
---
Stealth armor. With good perks nothing can see you
---
I mean technically the overseer is presumably handing out “you flavored” nuka to all people of Appalachia she just had you do the Raiders and Settlers personally. So I think she is still making it at the Nuka Factory so maybe she’s have you pick some up? Though why would the BOS just drink some Nuka a random wastelander gave them IDK.
---
Ok thanks
---
Yea that would've bummed me out too.
---
Another happy Canuck here! I don't use voice chat and have the worst aim ever so I've been wanting a "sorry" for the rare occasion when I manage to shoot another player in the back instead of what I actually want to hit.
---
OP real talk I'd not bother for now as at level 45 or 50 if you want the max strength version you'll be making it all over again. I understand you probs need to finish the Excavator Miner Miracles quest but I personally held off until max gear cap level so as to not waste a bunch of mats.... Especially the CSA as it wants a shit ton of ballistic fibre iirc.
---
I’m lvl 81 and just getting used to having a proper build. After spending some time with rifleman, I’ll prob go commando. I have two legendary railway rifles, trying to turn one into automatic!
---
Griefers will be on every game that has multiplayer sadly, its usually a small minority though. I have been playing dark souls 3 lately and people will literally throw poop at you lol hope he find someone else to annoy though!
---
Ahh yeah thanks, I just checked and her mom and Digger are both around. 
---
Digger is the ghoul secret agent who sends you to ventilate the reactor room in Vault 79. I think the other agents call him Chase after the mission is over.
---
I mean there is still the Scorched that the first BOS failed to clear so maybe they’ll wonder what happened to them find the scorched and make all scorched their enemy?
---
Their pretty powerful but outside of vats the recoil on the railway is almost impossible to control.
---
I'm a strong supporter of fun in the game.
---
I just change world :D
---
Or if they're stupid enough I get them to attack me and just kill them. I'd leave after you've killed them tho.
---
Can confirm, TS Mirv with demo cards is hella fun...the range is not!
---
Yes and they break soooo easily. Still, I love the choo choo :)
---
I got a lvl 15 (or somethin) B/Ffr 10mm yesterday cause it depends on enemy level not yours
---
The Thanksgiving shelf and refrigerator made me so happy. I've only been playing seriously for about a month since quitting shortly after release and seeing other players with camps that actually look like houses made me very envious.
---
If you care you can squeeze a bit more base damage by dropping Master Heavy Gunner to 2 and picking up Heavy Gunner rank 1.
---
The first rank of each of the 3 weapon perks are +10% and each additional rank is +5%.
---
Master x3 + Expert x2 = +35%
---
Heavy Gunner x1 + Expert x2 + Master x2 = +40%
---
So not only did they create a whole season which rewards a bunch of stuff, cosmetics, camp items, and currencies for free, which doesn’t provide any income, your idea is to reward them with atoms so u can use it in the atomic shop. They already gave u all this stuff. Yeah the perk card packs are not a good reward. Your reward for completing the season pass is everything in the season pass, which is free btw
---
I honestly don’t even go to camps with lots of plans , if people still sell plans they generally don’t have anything I’m looking for
---
Alright cool thanks
---
Concentrated Fire! I just got that, heard!
---
Ok, you and the previous person are talking about 2 different things. They are asking about the regen mutation, when you get the legendary down to half health and it mutates and gets its full health back. 
---
What you are talking about is before the enemy turns legendary in Uranium Fever. So yes, if you spawn kill the enemy before it turns legendary, you get nothing, because it is not legendary yet. It didn't used to be like that, I'm fairly sure this was put in place to try and stop the spawn kills by giving everyone a chance to get a hit in. It obviously isn't working that well.
---
Do you know where to place the camp?
---
Their are so many pussies on this game I stg
---
How much can you carry currently? Perhaps there is a way to modify load out to get to where you want.. for example;
---
I'm doing strength melee, but like to use some weird stuff like Gatling, bow, grenades. I'm a bloodied build with carnivore, amongst other unrelated mutations.
---
Currently, without being too almost dead, I carry up to 450-500.
---
I use melee weapon weight reduction and the food weight reduction. I have the Chem weight reduction back pack. 
---
During regular play, I'll have around 100lb free to pickup whatever I want. My stash is around 600 since I've started crafting a lot of SS gear and not hoarding. Admittedly, I could drop lots of random rifles, Chems, foods. But I choose to be a walking pharmacy grocery store with a weapon for every fun occasion.
---
My buddy does similar but uses all heavy guns and associated weight reduction.
---
O I thought that was intended.
---
How could we possibly tell you how to fully enjoy the game without knowing what you like and dislike?
---
You sure you didn't just see it for the torso? Just checked and the limbs still haven't been added.
---
My character wears the whole damned outfit. I like the stats....
---
\- Take your time with it. This game has a lot of neat areas to explore with story bits/lore that might get overlooked if you rush through it.
---
\- Try building up your CAMP. I wasn't really into the CAMP system until I messed around with it more. It can be pretty fun once you get the hang of it.
---
\- Don't be afraid to interact with other players. Some of my favorite moments have been from interactions with other players. The community's pretty nice and will probably drop stuff for you if you're low-leveled. From my experience, events and public teams are a good way to meet up with other players.
---
I feel like for the next one they should just increase the daily's to 500 score and set the weeklies to atoms like it used to be.
---
Thanks also to you, it's nice to see people like you and u/TheIllustriousJabba in a place where people are often toxic, good luck to both of you!
---
That happened me too. I kept killing him but he kept coming back then i noticed the damage on my camp and i left the world instantly. the thing i love most in fo76 there are a lot of nice people like to share protect so dont let that one toxic player take that idea.
---
They could have but nobody at bethesda is capable of performing a task so simple as switching on a light switch
---
I just wish I'd known starting an alt would erase all my mains pictures. 
---
I still have them on the PS capture gallery, but not ingame. Now when I switch back to my main all I see are my alts load screens.
---
I have 150 cork but everywhere I go on the map its already gone and the shops sold out. I think we are sabotaging each other by searching.
---
Scrip
---
The only time someone hopes for a sack snatcher
---
The power fist is overrated, the cinematic is ridiculous compared to just fast slashing with a claw both miner or death are better then a “kachunk kachunking” power fist.
---
I stopped donating after I realized how shitty the "reward boxes" are, I donated 13000 steel and all I got was booze and purified water, (and a crappy beret), which I already had, no thanks!
---
I recently datamined the details of the spawns for Guided Meditation. This spawn behavior is by design. The quest assigns a spawn radius for the enemy waves based on player locations. In other words, the waves of ghouls spawn near YOU. Once the ghouls spawn, they will immediately make a beeline for the speakers.
---
Yeah they changed the cap to 15m, how generous of them.
---
It's accessing your full inventory, which means it has to pull every bit of information on everything you own. Drop your notes and holotapes to thin out what it has to parse and it'll speed up some.
---
There is a lot of work needed to be done to revolvers to make them good. This would be cool as a starting point
---
Yes, it does apply to Grounded. 💯
---
SB or SBQ?
---
Correct. Server not responding means the server as a whole has experienced a latency spike for whatever reason. OP's issue, specific to workbenches/cooking stations/etc, is likely due to a bloated inventory.
---
I never had that issue on fallout 76. But, a pretty similar issue happened when I was playing Fallout 4. The connection to the controller randomly disappeared. My brother suggested me to rebuild database. Maybe it will work for fallout 76 too.
---
Great idea!
---
Not a bug or an exploit. Normal event mob behavior.
---
Actually caved in and tried subscribing to fo1st today. It wouldn't let me due to crashes.... hahhha 100%honest
---
Is that why that happens?  We thought line was massively glitched, but honestly makes life easier.  You just set up 1 person to tag and watch the generator.
---
Have a look on CD Keys, I’ve seen it pretty cheap on there, I got it for -£10 off retail price on there when it first came out :)
---
Tod he needs it to finance hes fantasy’s.
---
Always.  Especially when I'm making multiples of anything.  100 dirty water takes me 10 minutes some days.
---
I'm only level 20 so there isn't much for it to search through
---
Not for this one as you can't bulkscrews. But works with aluminium and steel etc.
---
Don’t really know what to tell ya. I was just voicing why some people don’t care for some of the challenges. Have a good night then.
---
I’d be good with 50-100 atoms for every additional lv after 100
---
you can also complete it by killing just two ghouls if you have better things to do. Two ghouls attack the bridge hub and as long as you don't go near the hub no more will attack. You can sit there and meditate for 6 minutes or whatever it is. (make sure you clear the scorched inside the building)
---
Let me tell you.... Post SBQ fight I was at Watoga station swapping legendaries, for some reason I had pacifist off (I think I had to kill my husband because he had a wanted level from lock picking in my workshop (on a public team.) Anyway I put my controller down to grab a drink and when I went to pick it up I shot the person coming up to exchange.  I felt awful and in a split second threw up hearts, and he just murdered me.  One hit (I was all rads.) I felt so bad, because it was an accident.  He took my junk (which is fair but annoying) and killed me again when I respawned in.  I was big mad, but only had myself to blame.
---
XB1 unfortunately but thanks!!
---
limits exist for a reason
---
Hemlock holes has so many too.
---
You'd be surprised. Stuff adds up fast when you're going through buildings for the first time.
---
Luck and a basic idea of where boxes drop , play more and you will find spots that have 3/6 boxes immediately as you spawn and more while you run to your favorite bush, bush Wookiees 4 life!
---
When have they returned items to players?
---
'Many a true nerd' on YouTube for fallout 3. It is long but worth the watch
---
PC
---
i heard it only works in workshops. Never bothered to test it
---
No I don't think we should just get if from any event, but I do thinknthat the 150 limit should be removed.
---
You can get extra scrip by doing all your daily quests by the way.
---
I got about 50. That's inside the golf house as well. I hate that place. Don't forget, baseballs, globes, bulk cork, and pipe pistols also have cork.
---
Looking forward? Yes. Hyped? No, I've learned not to be that anymore when it comes to Fo76.
---
They spawn there for quite some time,but they usually rush to the closest hub. How do you spawn kill them so far apart?
---
&gt;I entreat you to soak in the world, poke around and explore. The loudness of some parts drowns out the rest, if you let it.
---
So much this. I don't get why people continue to play if its such a chore or they're bored of it.. I've been playing since beta and still rack up multiple hours daily. 
---
Off topic a little but I've actually played more lately than ever, only for the fact my kids are being held on the other side of the world by bitch of an ex. But while they were here my 7yo girl loved sing alongs with Appalachia Radio and I'd still get more than enough game time in.
---
Anyway point is if you're not enjoying yourself do something else, and don't discourage people from trying it out, there's more than enough to do if you pace it out. There's no point of overdoing score challenges if you're going to put the game down due to being burnt out or whatever effect it seems to have on alot of people's posts here lately.
---
Yeah I get that but I’m not saying remove the cap on the legendarys u can scrap, just make it so we can earn a little from events, to get god roll SS Armor it legit will cost hundreds of thousands of script lol
---
Why haven't peopled discovered the wonderful advent that is *forcing* the other player to BUY your items first, and then you BUY your purchase secondarily? Why do you people ever drop anything when you literally have a safe way to make the trade legit??? Makes it so no one gets screwed; if they run, you got paid. If not, you got your trade. 
---
"Oh but I'm Max caps/have zero use for caps!"
---
Go make a Bank Alt. Transfer caps. MAKE the trade work, and stop risking your valuables.
---
To answer the main OP, though... Nope, you did the right thing. Good on you, and your new toy!
---
Same with caps which have been around longer but are still 30000. Nothings changing before the caps cap is.
---
Yeah those daily’s are boring AF, I don’t do them often because it’s the least fun thing in the game
---
I do agree with you though
---
I think all the daily limits should go.
---
People say Beth does it because they want people to play every day, but I have days where I tend to play a lot and I run out of scrip and stash space and refuse to drop legendaries, so I just log off pissed. I am beginning to think "why I am wasting my time with this game if I cant play it when I want to."
---
That's all there is right now. They give good so too if that helps.
---
like my ex. get it for the looks. so purdy. can't boil water.
---
def buy for me.
---
Just part of the tent
---
Your face when one regularly spawns on the roof of west tek
---
I doubt it. Its way to easy to exploit. I got like 3000 EXP for one shot with my Gauss shotgun. Other events like heart of the swamp don't do this. If it is intended then i can see this becoming a popular exp farming location.
---
About 0%... shit it was just the torso deep pockets fml &gt;_&lt;
---
&gt; I really hope they take their time to make it a fallout-like open world RPG game.
---
I don't know, I liked that you had clearly defined maps to work in, do everything and then move to the next. Reminds me a bit more of the first 2 Fallouts and even games like Knights of the Old Republic.
---
Also, most of the games I have are open world RPG-ish games, I wouldn't mind something a little different.
---
Stand outside holding up a boom box blasting "Careless Whisper" while wearing a shirt listing an important bug/issue that needs fixing.
---
I just wish quest photos didn’t use your gallery.  How many generator photos do you need?
---
Ahhh. Thanks. Maybe one day Atom store will have it 🤷‍♂️
---
I just dump them on people like a wasteland Santa , I keep the incredible stuff and four 3star low weight weapons to scrip and dump shit all over the place
---
It already is a popular exp farming location. And someone else said that it was datamined to be intended.
---
It's dangerous to go alone take this
---
They know how to make business, that's for sure.
---
Ah so that's why they were not spawning in the main building. The people who were at the event before me were all sat onto of the rooftops around the parking lot. Maybe that is why they were spawning in those locations. 
---
Also if you could clarify, when you said that it assigns a spawn radius around you for the ghouls, is that spawn fixed because they always spawned in the same locations?
---
Definitely, plus they removed so many free atoms from the old system, it wouldn't hurt to get some of them back.
---
Join every queen fight you see , repair kits are clutch
---
I hope they take back Fort Defiance I’m just tired of having to fight the charred ghouls and wendigo there
---
I can't...*it's a compulsion.* I am not a hoarder in real life but am in this game. It was so hard for me to drop 200+ sugar the other day
---
Getting married does not equate to having kids - biggest cap sink in the game of life.
---
no camp needed just happens naturally.
---
I run bloodied DCG or Bloodied PF, legendaries drop more melee weapons than anything else for me.   
---
I had my bloodied power fist PA before I even wanted one, got my first bloodied DCG at level 450.
---
I keep getting bloodied melee weapons, I think legendary RNG drops are based off your playstyle.
---
I could help with that the day  after tomorrow I’m busy tomorrow
---
i downloaded a bunch of games off gamepass more than a week ago for the reason you stated. 
---
but ...still Fallouting. Think i need a support group to quit.
---
Super mutant weapons make nice scrap
---
Wait where does it show how much we've turned in?  At this point I have barely any junk anyway.  I give it to my husband who has the FO1st scrap box.  I'm pretty much spamming collision course to get more prewar money to scrap for collectron week.
---
Acually today since it’s 3am so tomorrow I’ll be ok to help u
---
Sounds like a nice piece to hang on the wall and make conversation over
---
I would argue that abusing mob spawns is an exploit. Having 10 ghouls spawn in a single spot seems to fit that description but i can see your point.
---
Edit: also in other events with fixed spawns, only 2-3 spawn at a single location such as in radiation rumble and uranium fever.
---
You go to the tinker workbench and craft the circuit board under quest items, but like the other comment said this is one of the hardest events, so start it and wait a few minutes until more people show up or you’ll get smoked
---
limits exists for a reason
---
That storyline broke my heart....
---
I have worn the veil ever since
---
And yet apparently a raider almost flooded Charleston with one.
---
Totally understandable, I kinda convinced myself its like a real life survival situation. You wouldn’t carry 100 weapons during the zombie apocalypse why do it during a nuclear one , but everyone has to find their own way to enjoy the game I understand that. I also love the reactions I get when I drop stuff at people’s feet and they freak out about it like I bought them a puppy or something
---
When does this event end?
---
to do that they would have to remove how much scrip you can hold. Which would raise the limit. 
---
And that's just the way it goes for getting the good stuff unfortunately. Crafting your own endgame armour is probably better than having a random chance to find it after completing  like a raid or something
---
Lol. Can you beat the queen before the withdrawal effect?
---
Did you log out before reset? Did you play the normal game before NW?
---
I have about 1800 hours in, and I also feel like the run somehow broke me.   I purchased about 13 levels because I had something like 9K atoms.   I always did log in to do the daily and weekly challenges just because I enjoyed them; now they're gone.   It felt like a Catch-22 between endless grind/boredom and having a reason to log on.  
---
I'm at 291.  Yes, I know, very low for number of hours.  I only chased XP during this Run and otherwise spent alot of time just messing around.   My only goal now is to get to 300 so I can get all 6 legendary perk slots.  Besides that and the company of friends I've met, I feel done other than waiting for new content.   I look forward to remastered Mass Effect next month. (BTW, noticed my friends are starting to play other games too.)
---
Doesn’t matter what’s duped if you didn’t dupe it , and most of the time dupers aren’t even punished. The people they go after have 5 million large presents and 100+ explosive Gatling plasmas , they don’t care If rando randerson has a few duped weapons that are different types.
---
I just find it hilarious how they made Paige more of an asshole than Meg. 
---
Plus I like being called seven six. ;p
---
well I don't wanna to play with pc people, they have better aim system and cheats/mods, but i would like a sony/Xbox cross would be awesome.
---
So you need “coins” to get rid of duplicates or just to level them up to legendary? 
---
I really hope it is not to scrap them, as I could care less about legendary cards but am so done with like equipping my level 1 fix-it-all instead of my level 3 by mistake lol. With over 100 perk points currently that I could use, I am looking forward to loadouts, welt which time I will make use of them to set things up for different circumstances, building-PA-no PA-etc.
---
Alcohol addiction count, but you need at least 5 addiction to maximize the damage output. Just one addiction doesn't really help, its a mere 10% of increased total damage.  
---
Theres alot of guides and threads about junkie builds, search around, you will find some great tips. Also being a junkie lets you wear a full set of vanguard armor, full health, so you can be tanky while doing a good amount of damage.
---
They really should just charge 12.99/99.99 flat no matter what currency. It shouldn’t be rounded up or down. Especially it for all the b.s that comes with the game lol.
---
Would they prefer we do nothing to slow the spread of the plague? If the queen ever makes it out of Appalachia they'll be sorry we didn't do more. 
---
We'll nuke this place til it's a smoldering crater before we let this infection spread any further!
---
The reputation gain/loss numbers in [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wastelanders\_reputations](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wastelanders_reputations) are correct. Source: I added most of them from datamined information.
---
Keeping the gold for yourself is an effective 1500 reputation loss (-500 actual loss, and no +1000 gain), which is the equivalent of roughly 5 or 6 days worth of dailies. Most people will need more gold bullion than they can farm while maxing the faction reputations, so unless you only want a few specific plans and nothing else, ever, you're still better off taking all the gold for yourself and enduring 6 more days of faction dailies.
---
In September but I’m not sure of the date
---
If that’s al the money you got and you don’t make money easy... spend it on something else
---
Depends on how much you play, your build, and what you expect to get out of it. By maxing out charisma with chems, perks, and aid, you can buy it for 17,500 caps. Once you learn it, you can make as much as you want or need; just need a little flux, which you can get from scorched earth. Maxed out charisma, robot vendors will give you 500 each. Even if not maxed out, I think it's like 400 each. Players will pay 350 to 500 each from your vendor. If you're just wanting it to do crazy jumps, just find a player who has them for sale. The other thing you can do, is hold onto the plan, and maybe trade it for a big ticket item, rather than caps; although you might not get the desired return.
---
I read last night that it was recently upped to 760 Atoms.
---
My friend afk's on his private server by running into the wall at his camp. Just rubberbands his controller and goes to cut grass etc.
---
I would say make use of public teams, go into an event team, if you find an active one you can get swept up in an active session of rushing from high level event to high level event. You also get people checking the map and sometimes trying to bring the team over to take part in things.   
---
Do the score dailies and weeklies, these tasks will sometimes get you out to do things you usually put off.   
---
Get the perks to find magazines and bobble heads and travel, it is amazing how many of these things you miss without the audio help.
---
Doh... I also reach 100 today and was so exhausted I just logged out. Good to know the jetpack only works with a PA that looks ridiculous. I hope at least the fireplace works. Hopefully that isn't all for \*naught\*.
---
might get the flux from scorched earth and make as many as I can, thank you very much :D
---
I always have a hard time getting flux and the stuff used to make it. Any tips on how to get it down easy?
---
I’m in exactly the same boat, it came to gamepass and haven’t looked back.
---
Why can’t they just reduce the space needed between camps so that we can place our own camps closer to one another? 
---
I saw a video of how far apart camps have to be and it was ridiculous. If we could simply put them closer then we could actually build communities like they showed in the initial preview for the game instead of distant camp sites.
---
I thought about and I think I'll wait to buy it until I have more caps so I dont go bankrupt, yknow?
---
Awesome, thanks man
---
Good point, because I think it might have been the XP chasing that got to me, something I never used to do.   I've always enjoyed the daily and weekly challenges.
---
Spawn at Bolton Greens. Pick lock behind counter. Sprint north to farmhouse. Pick tool chest in Quonset hut. Done.
---
It’s not gonna happen. They already changed all that right after FO1st came out. No discounts, no extra space, no persistence, you get what you get now and that is all.
---
Unless you got flux out the wazoo, that makes sense to me.
---
Gimme the middle finger
---
TS is very close to a liability nowadays, but the FFR likely makes up for it. Keep trying!
---
...Unless you’re the Doom guy!
---
Stealth suit possum extended backpack gives me 330 carry weight med weight reduction fallout first storage have all the space I need
---
If Beth's perk loadout gonna be worser than mod im gonna laugh very long and very hard.
---
I'd plaster my walls with butts.
---
gonna attend every scorched earth event I can
---
That’s the heart emoji
---
I scrapped my first set of Peepers but on my latest character I made damn sure I kept them. Safely in my stash!
---
6 days
---
The community managers said they were aware of it and stated that they were intended to be in and were researching it but no word since then
---
If you make the fixer automatic does it then count towards automatic perks? Or does it remain a non automatic rifle?
---
Are you dropping nukes yet?  If so, target Morgantown. If not, hazmat suit/ power armor +radshield/ Chinese stealth suit and go into a nuke zone and kill anything you see, loot hardened mass, glowing mass, high radiation fluid, and raw flux. Scorched earth awards already stable flux (though the amounts and types are random)
---
The event basically seeks out the location of each player, draws a large circle around each player, and then spawns waves of ghouls within those "player circles."
---
I use this to my advantage all the time by sitting on top of the Bridge Speaker roof. When I'm doing the event solo, it forces all of the ghouls to spawn near me. The cliff and all of the water around me act to limit spawn points for the ghouls, limiting them to 2 angles of approach. Since I'm also sitting above one of the speakers, which the ghouls are obligated to prioritize as a target... It basically forces endless ghouls to run straight into a kill zone :) I don't have to worry about the other speakers, because the ghouls can't run anywhere else unless they destroy the Bridge Speaker.
---
If you have everything else you want then sure but otherwise probably not. Unless you have the ability to acquire flux (marsupial takes crimson from memory) then you wont find it too useful. I dont know whats going on but I hardly sell any serums lately despite the price being on the lower end of the scale. Its not too hard to hit the caps limit from bot vendors without selling serums to them. 
---
If you are in need of a caps sink then yeah get them, otherwise prioritise something else
---
Gotcha thanks
---
you're probably right, thank you very much :]
---
Nobody speaks, i say hello to everyone. People have only destroyed and taken things from Me so far. Fo76 is like a failed social experiment. No wonder Bethesda dosnt give a shit lol
---
I’m just in it for the chickens.
---
Jon is the only person I know of that actually has a minus star in perception. That guy wouldn’t know what hit him, even if you hit him dead center in the face with a shovel in slow motion. 
---
Still waiting for his FO4 YOLO run.
---
Nope. They have issues and all you can do is block and ignore or jump servers. 
---
I have traveled to their camp before and dropped a microscope and golf ball and sent them the message, “hope that helps you find yours”, thinking maybe once they do they will stop trying to prove they are all that when they aren’t anything more then a tic-tac. LoL
---
Hm, interesting. I played my high health character most of the time and it felt like I would run into the fast travel bug maybe 1 out of every 20 attempts. It was annoying but I also didn't think about it regularly. I switched to my first character and started trying out a bloodied build for the first time and it is now unbelievably frustrating. I counted 16 attempts to fast travel before the 17th attempt succeeded. Sigh.   
---
Now that I've read this, I'm going to try messing around with those factors to see if I can get it to work. Figuring out any viable solution would make it much easier to continue playing this game without regularly wanting to bash my head into something. =P
---
Ye, at beginings purified water was gold price. But after, dirty/boiled water is more needed.
---
Thank you, now I need to look for vanguard armor. Thanks foe bringing something constructive to the table. Everyone else is too busy downvoting and being mad i called them toxic.
---
Only on PC, the numbers are surely higher considering XB1 and PS4, we have no safe number but it's safe to assume the numbers are way higher than 30k live players
---
 You are just a contrarian. Don't worry - there are plenty of you around :D
---
I have to think it's pretty meta.
---
They've had it for quite a while now and have just been waiting to use it as a makeshift "we're sorry guys" offering. ;p
---
I'm not really sure how it happened it just know that it did. I kind of just stumbled upon it.
---
Same as my friend and I did. Played for about a week now, and are lvl 64 or so. 
---
I played it for a few days on the free weekend a little while ago, but it really didn’t feel like a FO game for me. When I saw it in game pass, I gave it another go. Now, I really enjoy the game, and I’m getting the “feeling”!
---
Even if they did that there's still a problem, I heard about players that struggle to find 250 cork to donate and so they don't donate anything
---
Really? In 309 levels i have never seen that happen. Next time i'm there ill test it out. Seems like this event is pretty buggy. 
---
On second thought the whole game is kind of buggy.
---
I wouldn't. It won't be impressive that way.
---
I went to camp the other night that had just that, 5 display cases with nothing but preserved pies. An entire wall of them.
---
My immediate thought wasn't "this player is dedicated" it was "I need to get far away from this dupers camp asap." ;p
---
Yea i agree the line in the sand glitch was pretty nice. The only problem was when people started using explosives and not letting anyone else get in on the action.
---
Concrete. Cork still ongoing.
---
But are you talking to them first to get a sense of whether it was intentional?
---
there are a ton of emotes that have been requested like the no mic emote, that are already done, ready to go. but instead of releasing them as a QoL, they use them as a gimmick to get people to log in and look in the shop.
---
the body on the bridge at Camden Park that has the key to the west door of the bridge (which is also a Power Armor spawn point).
---
I dont get it
---
Fallout 3 is the best fallout
---
Ask those friends that hate it if they ever played it and gave it a chance. Just about all the people I spoke to that was negative about F76 never played it themselves and just regurgitated the same old crap they heard from youtubers in the beginning.
---
What is meat week?
---
Didnt know the robots pay 500 for it. People who sell them under 500 in their vendors are pretty generous. IMHO the player price in vendors is too low. Considering flux, weight, initial investment, robot prices, creating them and the high prices the enclave takes for a serum it should be around 700. Never bought a serum recipe because of the low prices people take in their vendors.
---
It was surprising to me that console players would have an advantage in that regard. I can only assume that it's because on xbox or playstation the platform is responsible for moderation &amp; handling abuse reports vs requiring additional bethesda employees (and thus cost).
---
Exactly what happened to me. I didn’t hate it, but it just felt super repetitive and I tapped out. Nowhere near as immersive as any fallout game.
---
I'll give you 50k caps for it OP
---
Reduce ALL weight legendary would be awesome.
---
I think you've hit the nail on the head with that. The water around that spot must be the key, limiting the spawning locations. I'm still not sure why they always spawned in the same spot though. Maybe there are set locations where mobs could spawn throughout the palace but only the ones inside the spawning circles are used.
---
Yes and you know what else would be awesome? To place a couple of your photos in your camp lie a poster.
---
Nope, each silo has a cooldown when a nuke is launched on that server and you also have a personal timer (3hrs?) for each silo you yourself launch.
---
Can you not enter the silo at all?
---
I know the days of MMO's are gone but are people really just not familiar with the concept of a [Time Sink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_sink#:~:text=1.2%20Trade%2Doffs-,In%20video%20games,for%20longer%20periods%20of%20time.) anymore?
---
This is a blatant time sink plain and simple, nothing more sinister than that. It was designed to be such and is working as intended.
---
You realize they have other options and you’re just being a jerk.
---
I don't think you should feel dumb about something that I consider to be an extraordinarily irritating bug. I spent a year having to manually re-equip a ton of stuff Every Single Time I played the damn game and it was horrible. Today I still have to manually re-equip a ton of stuff at least a few times per week when other people use my console. Apparently none of the employees have friends? Or a partner / spouse? Or the beta testers don't either? Or this just wasn't considered a high priority to fix?   
---
Related: The photo limit in the gallery applies to ALL PLAYERS COMBINED. So get ready to have a lot of "fun" arguments if you share your console with even one person, and it gets even more fun if you share the game with multiple friends / housemates / family members / etc. :(
---
Let's give those players a deep pocket mod for the only piece they will never install it on... the torso. I mean cmon.
---
Appreciate the post.  I'll save my atoms.
---
Hell ye. They’re rad. Even if they don’t walk around
---
I'd like a projector for your base that projects the pictures from your gallery and changes picture every 3 seconds or so.
---
I played a lot of the game solo, and with randoms at events.
---
However, since I befriended 3 other regular players from the other side of Earth ( France, Britain, Scotland) and we are in party chat when we play, the game is exponentially more fun. 
---
My best tip. Make some Fallout 76 friends.
---
Yep. If u are in the event area u get the reward. Can then up to an event. Stand in a safe place and literraly do nothing whilst everyone else completes it and get the reward. Have it lots at teacup event where someone will join and sit on top of the teacup whilst I defend the pipes. And get the reward
---
Like the raiders. The raiders has been a letdown for me, they were so bland I scrapped my evil character, and just did their mission on my main. And wanted to kill them on my BoS character but can't even hurt them. BoS has been a dynamic faction in fallout sometimes good sometimes bad, unfortunately I think they will just be like the raiders.
---
They are. Have you tried to clear out the whole of Whitesprings Bunker? It’s not easy when the assaultrons are glitched. And some of the turrets are also invincible.
---
You can get rewards for Cop a Squatter and be nowhere near the event.....
---
I always use a cabinet inside a tent at Atlas. Did it twice yesterday and three times today.
---
Tbf, If explosives were meta, SBQ fight would have like 2fps.
---
No i have launched from all 3 silos on the same server. So much fun!
---
That is just bad form from them. silly.
---
the longer the fight, more spawns for XP. 
---
some people are just assholes. Like the \*&amp;\*% who wasn't on a team, yet kills the Captain with a single melee hit at riding shotgun, while 4 others are finding crates.
---
I would like if your rep with a faction can change, and if you get low enough they will attack you. There could be a way to increase you rep again if you don't want them hostile. Would really help RP my good guy and bad guy characters.
---
This happens a lot
---
Not a lot of it rn
---
optional i just did that quest it blatantly said optional in all those instances
---
I bought 40 bulk cork from robot vendors to supplement my 10 bulk I collected in the past week. That's where my contributions end for this part.
---
(Just in time before someone put me over max caps I might add.)
---
The perfect time to use the new emote! Hopefully it’ll help avoid some situations like this in the future.
---
This has been happening a lot to me after this patch. Also being in camp building mode is horrible for me.
---
The trophy for shooting people in the dick was fun. Oh, and the low intelligence ending 😬
---
18 golf balls on a rock by the river at Ohio River Adventures. Most in a bucket next to a golfing Jangles, and a few more actually on the rocks. Efficient for me because I hit up the Raider camp there to sell mirelurk meat for the rep.
---
Mmhmm get some salt and some squirrel bits and you get a tasty squirrel stew.
---
How have I never encountered this before? Granted I actively avoid going to low level events with my main because the low level players who participate need the XP/rewards more than I do at this point.
---
This reminds me of the bug with the Feed the People event early in the games life that awarded everyone on the server with cans of stew if players completed the event on that server.
---
Cool I'll check it out. Thanks buddy.
---
Yeah, im the same here, bloodied stealth commando build here, it does crazy amount of damage to the SBQ, i whip it out after the queen has regenerated her healts so that everyone has had a chance to get their tags in.
---
Stepped away from 76 for a bit and this is an actual item in the game now? You mean dirty water, which i can get an unlimited supply of from every water source? Damn bruh
---
Shake hardah, boy!
---
Commando perks if it’s automatic
---
No they wouldn’t have to remove how much u can hold, EA/Activision/The purveyor doesn’t have a daily cap on how much u can spend on her
---
Optional doesn’t mean any thing
---
I second this.
---
They should have renamed it "Feed The Participants" then.
---
But the Enclave and Brotherhood haven't met yet. The Brotherhood doesn't even know about the Enclave.
---
TS Auto grenade launcher is a blast too, might not kill anything BUT I AM DANGER CLOSE.
---
Whaaaaaaat i bought it for 4K gold, it’s free???
---
Jk I have no idea why it’s 4K gold
---
Did you actually get addicted to alcohol? Like, does it show up on your effects tab? 
---
You should get a flat 10% DMG bonus with the addiction.
---
Don't worry, you'll be banging your soul out when meat weeks start.
---
Yeah this would be nice, or just even an increase of script/other ways to get script like completing events ya know
---
It's 500 if you're unyielding with hard bargain, or any combination that gets you to I believe 25 charisma (is what I believe it caps out at)
---
If you play the settlers quest it's free. Otherwise no.
---
If you side with raiders you can’t get the stealth suit until you get higher rep with the settlers.
---
and he is selling 100 rolling pin plans...
---
Yeah a while back a friend nearly died to a trap camp, luckily he didn’t die so we both got back at him by doing a coordination attack, I nuked the queen and he nuked his base around 1 minute after, he didn’t notice and his camp got nuked while we was all fighting the queen! Soooo funny
---
The Blood Eagles place a bid of “steal it off your cold, dead corpse”, OP.
---
Damnit, you are correct. Custom, not customS!
---
I sided with raiders but did the prep quests for both factions until the point of no return
---
1. Don’t remember asking
---
2. Your lying cause I’m looking at it right now and it says and I quote “investigate sal’s grinders” and nowhere does it say (Optional): .
---
I sell everything at 1 cap. Lol. Except legendaries.
---
Enclave: “That used to be OUR thing when we were the government!”
---
The true capitalism.
---
Yeah and for people who arent gonna trade for one the gauntlet is quite a good one too. A little less damage but still ridiculous. I have crafted a few and have an instigating ss one. I wish it was bloodied
---
Don't know about the workshop one but the other one should make it a little harder to find. It should feel more like litterally searching for clues.
---
I Can't progress past the circuit breaker, the door Ra-Ra, Gail and Johhny go through is borked for me, it won't let me through, I get in to that bigger antechamber with the intercom and broken railing and security gates, can't use the intercom and can't speak with johnny since I can't go through the door. I was just starting to enjoy Fallout 76 too.
---
The Fixer doesn’t.
---
Yeah, I didn’t do that and I payed big time. I had to get settler rep from cautious plus grind 4000 gold for the suit. I just got the stealth suit like a week ago lol.
---
Explain. Why can't you enter?
---
the bets thing about fatman is the bash animation. maybe just make it a melee weapon now
---
I want a unicorn with candy floss (cotton candy USA, Fairy Floss Oz) wings
---
Bethesda: *releases a patch with more bugs and game breaking content* "opps we will look into a hotfix"
---
Rockstar seeing a challenge: hold my nukashine while I break this so bad they will talk about it on the fallout forums..
---
They've always just been from public events (and riding shotgun). If you have been getting from all events you have had a lucky bug.
---
ok buddy i managed to do the quest literally two days ago perfectly fine. can you not find sals grinders? yes obviously not all parts of the quest are optional but the find clues parts which you eluded to are. go to data look at the quest press show on map. sometimes markers are a little slow but i really don’t understand your trouble.
---
Conversely Ive had the opposite - sure a few times people have taken my junk if Ive died, but in the entire time Ive played (500hrs +) I've only had workshops contested 4 times. 2 of those were one of us started capturing while someone else was in the area.
---
I give lots of things to newbies - usually some spare plans/ammo/aid. Always get a heart emote. Most interaction is usually via the emotes - I have a mic and will talk if someone else is, but otherwise you can communicate well enough via emotes - come here, gift, thumbs up etc.
---
They aren’t in the game anymore, they were taken out with the wastelanders update
---
When I enter the elevator the hand scanner denies me
---
Just got the Thunderpipe last night so I feel that. 
---
I did some of the Run, up to Sheepsquatch Plushie, on an alt too. It was interesting doing some dailies with an always-ovencumbered toon.
---
Vault raids aren’t active i believe but i’m level 84 or so haven’t been playing for more than a few months if you ever need a buddy to grind with feel free to pm me and i’ll give you my GT
---
When I’m in the mire around watoga area I often get the squatters event complete and get the reward.
---
prob on cooldown. 
---
you can launch from every silo. and if by that time 3hrs have passed go back to the 1st silo.
---
still battling. join another server
---
is a weekly event, as fasnacht
---
I’d like a worn Raider flag for sure.
---
Low level events in the forest give a chance to get the firemans responder outfit so they’re worth doing just hang back if there’s low levels there and get involved if u need to
---
The hand scanner denied me access is the problem I have
---
You buy the mats at the perveyour now with scrip.  Vault is long gone.
---
My unarmed has a bloodied gauntlet, does more than enough damage
---
Oh ok
---
5 playable chars, all done bullion mission. Yes, if you don’t drop some of the grinds, it becomes a chore. I won’t take a break but look forward to playing the game like i want again
---
Yes, definitely worth it
---
Ok cheers man
---
My lack of grouping has often been by design. I'd rather the great legendaries go to people who are interested in checking out all the work that I put into my camp build, kicking it for a minute and saying hello, etc. I find it boring to have a steady stream of people who just want to shop &amp; bounce. Most of my characters don't need caps all that badly.
---
Could be worse, just look at red dead online. Can't decide who I hate worse at this point the game I can play but is a grind with bugs, or the game that dashboards every 10 min
---
I agree with you but It gets stupid when its in every other quest it’s just frustrating
---
Ya the scrip limit needs to go,i just dont get it, i buy the game only to be able to unlock parts of it through min burst of content???? Thats base on a daliy limit? So i get better by staying on the game to get better wepons instead of how good i am in game ? Please change my mind...
---
Yeah that's what I'm going for
---
So I could roll endless legendary modules and force craft the best armour in a week if your dedicated. I’d like to see a weekly limit of say 2-3000 and remove the daily one. That makes more sense
---
Everybody, is there perhaps a limit on how many nuke blast zones that cab be present at a time? As there were already 3 when I joined the server, would it perhaps not allow anyone access to the silos until one of the blast zones disappears?
---
Um I think this is very possible but likely eh. Great idea though upvoteeeee
---
I love lucky bugs, Ward would autocomplete my quest first time I spoke to him from patch 20 till 21 the other day.
---
I totally believe it. I often buy things I don't really need from vendors if I am amused by the camp or impressed by the camp build or etc.
---
Keep jumping servers. Protip: if you spawn in a server and you see a huge red circle somewhere in the map, probably the silos have been used. They could be all used or just one or two.  
---
Remember that you can launch a nuke from three silos: Alpha, Bravo and Charlie. So keep trying in any of the three.
---
Since everybody kept leaving it on, I decided to just incorporate that into my camp build (rad shower goes above a bathtub, rad shower goes above a garden, etc.)
---
Companies think hoarding materials will mean youll play less which isn't true. but they want you to come back daily and weekly, they dont want binges and dry spells, they want consistency
---
But they also dont realize thats tiresome on people and creates dismay and jaded views of the game cycle
---
Yep that's it. Each silo has a cooldown after launch, if there's 3 red circles on the map you can't launch until they cooldown. Switching server should fix that
---
Ahh right, thanks bro
---
Alcohal addiction is the hardest to get. It is RNG but will require at least 5 drinks but usually 7. Did you get the addiction notification? If so, your addiction only shows up in the pip boy when the drug in question is worn out. So as long as you’re under the influence of alcohol, the addiction is not listed. But you should see the 10% damage increase regardless
---
That's a steady number of corn soup
---
I'm sad we won't be able to nuke them out of existence.
---
Happy to help out. I think Bolton Greens has some golf balls as well.
---
I guess... But you know sometimes I thing it word be smart that I did get the Ps5 first or I took a break off of Fo76 a while
---
The sbq has immunity to explosions but bloodied explosive weapons are fun, i have a bloodied fatman and a bloodied m79 gl in my toy box, when i have to do distant thunder i dont call artillery, i have my own,sometimes i do the event in one hit,thats if the scorched are all together in a mob.
---
Not even halfway there for me and I worry I won't finish it. I was really gung-ho at first but then I just... stopped caring. It's so tedious and boring. I honestly thought we'd just progress by doing whatever in the game not the same bland ass dailies and weeklies I was doing before.
---
At least before I got atoms to show for it, now I'm getting a buncha bullshit I won't even use.
---
Yes I can enter in another session now, thank you
---
Thank you all :)
---
No problem, happy nuking
---
I kinda like the quest photos from when you first get the camera. I still have my photos of Wavy Willards, the Halloween Store, and the Asylum from back in 2019 when I started playing. Ahh, the memories lol. If kept my photos around 45/50 to keep room and in doing so I've had to choose hard which ones to delete.
---
That one likely doesn't come from Bethesda... playstation is highly unenthusiastic about crossplay. :(
---
Do you have fallout 1st? Could you pm me your name if i could add you and try to join ur world?
---
The Atom shop is designed to rip you off, never gives you the full details, adds bundles with crap you just bought the week before (which it doesn't discount based on stuff you owned already) but with one or two things only attainable in the bundle, etc. etc.
---
I agree. Vegas felt lived in and alive but after you completed the story, there wasn't much reason to keep playing. Fallout 4 was innovative for the time but it was too vast and you can't do much with the NPCs. My buddies and I love messing around and just playing 76, and we don't really get bored.
---
“OpTinOl i jUsT diD ThAt qUsT iT bLaNtLy SaiD oPtIoNaL iN aLl ThOsE iNsTaNcEs”. Which is it? Is it optional in all those instances or not all parts optional. Please tell me which one.
---
&gt;free.
---
No it isn't, it came at the cost of a *bunch* of free atoms we used to be able to get through dailies and weeklies.
---
I mean we can already literally carry a standard system ton on our backs....
---
Many have asked for this feature.
---
Barely an inconvenience!
---
Jokes aside it's still faster to get 25k xp than waiting to join matches and do stuff like that.
---
Yeah, me and a friend were talking about that a few weeks back lol.
---
Agreed. Even then I don’t think I’ve noticed it like in the other games and I’m l80
---
Yeah I've been bouncing between both of the golf courses. It has some baskets in the back that sometimes have some, also sometimes a baseball here or there.
---
I’m always down for some doing some events, I’ll add you and my ign is shoooops
---
Gamestop had it on sale about 2 weeks ago for 30 new. Thats when i picked it up. Still haven't played but excited to once i have some time off work
---
Alright sure thing, I’ll save your username and add u when im on :)
---
The real kick in the face is that these specific plans are already in the game and in the list, all that needs to happen is for them to be enabled. That can easily be hotfixed and might not even need server restarts. They already did a little hotfix for the smiley gold exploit, they could have spent a few extra minutes to fix the SS deep pocketed plans while they were at it...
---
More raider stuff... Woohoo...
---
The one thing I've noticed that both games share in common is there is a weird group of people that have like an almost Stockholm Syndrome-like relationship with the game where they don't want to acknowledge its problems, and seem all too willing to shower the creators in praise for however little they do, no matter how small or insignificant it is.
---
I'm starting to think it's more common the smaller the audience for the game is, since Fallout 76 isn't exactly the most popular online game out right now, and Red Dead Online probably isn't even close to meeting Rockstar's expectations like they probably have with GTA Online.
---
Unfortunately that has not been my experience on PS4. The spawn point is highly impacted by where I place the camp box, but not the vendors.
---
Serum recipes should be your end game i have too many caps   purchase.
---
can only agree with you unfortunately, either you have a scrip limit, either it will be much harder to find legendaries
---
I send u request :))
---
Have you tried moving the camp box around?
---
Sweet, hopefully it goes threw because sometimes friend requests don’t pop up for some reason
---
Yeah, the good rolls are pretty well known as leveling weapons
---
The real tax
---
Im not spending atoms to level up.. thats what they want...
---
U can add too if u like 😅 its ayes23
---
Never happened here, but i can advice beside the usual verify cache, to delete the fallout 76 folder in my documents.  
---
Let the folder recreate and resync (obv you will lose all your ingame settings and photos) and see if that helps.
---
Sure thing, I’ll add u when im on but I’m just taking a break right now since I’ve been playing for a while already
---
I have a fatman as a meme weapon, also when theres a bunch of enemies ill just weaken em all and get XP lol
---
Its a classic weapon and i appreciate it
---
I feel like they were afraid of it being broken but everything else bloodied is broken already
---
Oh come on man, don't let us pull every little bit of info from your nose.
---
What does the game say when the scanner turns red?
---
Then what they should do is add a recipe for changing purified to boiled, 1 to 1 no wood required.  
---
That way we don't need to collect 2 dirty to get 1 boiled, when we already have 100+ purified on us
---
Alright see u later
---
I wouldn't say that they should get rid of the daily script limit entirely but they definitely have to double or triple it cause boi my 770/800 stash box is looking bad rn
---
Oooooh. And there goes every Atom I ever thought about having.
---
I'd say this event is mainly for first class citizens
---
To me cosmetics impact the game WAY more then perk cards... you dont get to tell me how to play the game... I am mostly builder... I play for my camp and char...
---
It’s great for mob events like line in the sand. I find it kills most of them for that and those it doesn’t I’ve still tagged at least.
---
There's due to be a DLC introducing a new playable location, another asteroid.
---
Currently a bit light on details, like will accessing the DLC content require a new playthrough (think it will) but nevertheless, it's coming, so expect to see the base game on offer too.
---
Buying serum recipes is a nice cap sink. If you cant generate a lot of caps, wait a bit. You can reach cap day limit easy if you raid West Tek and sell all the supermutant weapons, or making a water farm.
---
BGS doesn't actually work on 76. Bethesda Austin (formally Battlecry Studios) is the responsible for development of this game.
---
Why would someone give hundreds of mats to a most likely scammer, when you can just deliver the junk yourself, literally a few meters away? lol
---
Season passes just aren't good game design. They're not designed for player enjoyment, but to extract money from a few specific people. It's gross and should be scrutinized as heavily as loot boxes.
---
Wish more noobs would visit my camp, tryna be helpful with these giveaways lol
---
I saw a good compromise posted here before: use the same system as bullion.  Turn in as many legendaries as you like, for as much 'legendary tokens' as you like.  You'd need another new machine, probably in the Rusty Pick, that lets you turn legendary tokens into 150 scrip per day.
---
We get the benefit of being able to turn in as many or as few legendaries as we want, while still being limited to 150 scrip per day.
---
Its would be much better if you could get 6000 atoms in 3 months like before... not 2500
---
I got my camp next to that scorched farm thing and I have a vendor that is for new players only. It has lvl 1-5 weapons completely upgraded, low level armor, Stims/Radaways/RadX/etc. High level player actually dont buy anything from that specific vendor which is nice to see. The weapons cost 1-2 caps tho, depending on what weapons but 2 caps isn't really all that much, isn't it.
---
Dont tell me you like big sweaty men shooting each other with big fat missile lauchers?
---
That’s an awesome idea. I might use that myself if that’s cool with you?
---
I used to get 6000 atoms in the same time period before all of this :)
---
Good, now do 3 more seasons and you can almost aford one PA skin
---
Lode Baring is another one, you only have to press the button to start the event, then fast travel away.  Return 7 minutes later and get rewards.  You never even have to enter the mine.
---
I usually go do the events at camden park and then return for the free notes.
---
agreed.
---
some days i dont want to play at all, others i can put 3-4 hours in, the current system does nothing to incentivise me to play more, because when i *can* play, i quickly hit arbitrary limits
---
remove caps on- vendor selling, scrips, bullion
---
You get a warning when taking the workshop, did you not read it? And no way is this 'community' as bad as you feel it is.
---
&gt;I have better things to do besides looking at every corner in multiple rooms.
---
Than move on and do those "better things"...
---
No wonder game industry is fucked up right now because young gamers nowdays are to lazy to figure shit themself and need those pointers and quest markers everywhere.
---
I remember when I was playing Morrowind back in the day. No quest markers, no pointers, no internet to look shit up. It was kinda cruel by the modern day standards but in the same time it was super rewarding and enjoyable when you figured some hard quests and stuff just by yourself. Good old times...
---
An absolute must if you own multiple power-armour sets since there is no other way to tell the difference.
---
Even if you don't own multiple sets, it's easy to accidentally acquire another chassis that would be otherwise indistinguishable from your complete Ultracite PA.
---
I didn't "create" this kind of vendor, I saw it on yt and thought it would be cool. It helps newer players to get a good start. You won't make any caps tho which imo is worth it tho.
---
So if you wanna do it go on :D
---
Serum recipes are a long term thing. The robots pay 500 for them, but you dont need to bother, as you can sell the robots any old crap to hit the 1400 cap, and its very easy to hit this. Selling to players then allows for additional caps above and beyond the 1400.

Flux and creating them depends on play style - if you regularly turn up to scorched earth you get 4 stable flux each time it completes, so dont need to bother with raw flux + stabilising.
---
Regarding pricing, depends how quickly you want them to move, vs how many you need to sell to break even.
---
E.g. if you sold them for the suggested 2k you would only need to sell 9 to break even. However, unless you find someone new/doesnt care, chances are they'll just buy from someone cheaper.
---
I personally have mine set to 299 (I recieve 270), and they shift pretty quickly. Means I need to sell 65 to break even, but I find people will buy my entire stock in the hopes of flipping them.
---
A big part to consider, is the cap limit, and how quickly you gain caps. If you play everyday, and do the 1400 from the robots you'll amass 17500 in 13 days. Thats not including caps from events, stashes, loose on SM, or anything you sell from your vendor. 
---
You can only store 30k. So investing in serum recipes makes sense - you'll get the caps back in 13 days even if you dont sell a single one.
---
I like the perk packs the best, but I'm new.
---
Its a very rare event reward from the forest region :)
---
All the limits needs to go.
---
Yeah. I like that idea. And hopefully it’ll get them to pay it forward to others.
---
i too enjoy it. could it be better..of course.
---
change up weapons and play style for more fun. 
---
also....there is no such thing is too much violet flux. Looking at you 0.50 cal. Greedy bugger.
---
Well done mate 👍
---
I got half way and called it, I'm taking a very long break from this game.
---
Too grindy but also the grind to value ratio is all out of whack.
---
I hate how functionally identical revolvers are in Fallout 4 and 76. 
---
Single-action .45 pipe revolver.  Doesn't even have a .308 conversion like in Fallout 4.
---
A single-action .44 magnum revolver.
---
Another single-action .44 magnum revolver with fewer mods
---
And a very old ACTUAL .44 single-action revolver with even fewer mods that must be reloaded one round at a time.
---
It's weird that the .44 pistol looks like it should be double-action, but the animations and games treat it like single-action.
---
I swear, Fallout 4 has like the worst weapon variety and functionality on offer in the entire Fallout series, and it's such a shame that Fallout 76 inherited the same problem by reusing much of the assets in Fallout 4.  The first thing they could do to make their revolvers more interesting is adding a pipe revolver conversion like in 4, making the .44 pistol actually double action, and maybe the other two revolvers stronger.  Also, add a new revolver, like a hunting revolver in .45-70.
---
Ah yes, but is it a *good* reason?
---
When I started playing 2 players gave me ~50 Stims and whenever I have enough myself I just search for new players and give it to them. 
---
So these 2 dudes got me to help newer players so hopefully my/your camp will do the same :D
---
I'm not in game right now, but I'd also be happy to team up and lvl up. Speaking of that, what level is your character? Because I have 2 with different lvls. In any case, I'm always up for something to do in game now that I have finished reconstructing my camp :P You can add me if you want, it's Dark_Wolfy.
---
I had a guy drop me an Urban Scout Mask (which had subsequently disappeared one day when I logged in and found it just gone). 
---
That inspired me to drop care packages at the Vault. Never considered the vendor idea.
---
might be a blessing. Get prepped. That's gonna start Encryptid. If you aren't ready for it it's going to pwn your butt. enjoy
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Baa_Baa_Black_Sheep
---
there you fucking go 
---
do you need me to teach you how to read too? maybe some directions on how to open a link? 
---
and there’s a difference between you’re and your btw when you figure that out you might be able to fool people into thinking you graduated 8th grade.
---
Yes. It would save time and money.
---
Yes. You take out huge chunks with each hit.
---
It'll be availible in the atomic shop soon.
---
You miss the pet rock?
---
Nuclear silo, launch a nuke while you're in ;)
---
Never considered it too but when I saw it on yt I realized that I'm camp is in a new player area and that I frequently get new players in my camp so I just said fuck profit and build a dedicated vendor for those new ones
---
To be fair, I did use the deep pocket mod on the torso until I got enough flux to get the jetpack.
---
Done all that reputation and bullion grind.. Next level is the backpack with Jangles. I am simply tired and kinda worn out. I won\`t stop playing but I will not grind another season. I expect I\`ll see some levels, but for me it\`s back to casual weekend gaming and actually trying to enjoy it again.
---
I dislike the way Beth is handling Fo76 like cheap fremium mobile game. A LOT!
---
I went to donate concrete to realised I'd missed the deadline....timekeeping is hard in the wasteland
---
Mine just runs fine. 
---
Maybe try a manual update or restart your wifi?
---
What’s the name of the event? :)
---
I'm going to be relieved when this stupid thing is over...no having to log in daily...I actually want to log in when I have the urge to play, not when they want me to play. Sucks all the fun out of it. Playing has become a chore. If I wanted to do chores, I'd go clean my house in rl.
---
You obviously didn't play original Fallout games then. In the very first game you don't even have quest markers/areas, nobody tells you where to go and you don't even have a quest log. You just travel around looking for clues and ask people.. Fallout 76 is way too easy when it comes to quests, everything is marked and literally put on a plate before you, all you have to do is press a button and oh no, sometimes you have to open your eyes and look a little around you.
---
Luck of the draw will help with durability.
---
Shiotgunner perk under Str for damage, skeetshooter (this card is amazing and so aften overlooked) for grouping and accuracy, under perception. Adrenal Reaction will boost damge as you take damge without needing to be bloodied or junkie.
---
enjoy it while you use it, eventually another shottie will resign that to your stash or vendor.
---
HAIL THE KING - Gauss Shotgun
---
I’ll try
---
Relaunch the game and/or restart the systems.
---
LOL a modder.
---
Any event in that area I think
---
Its a local specialty product that didnt get national distribution
---
Oh god please no more pistols perks in agility. Its a cluster already.
---
Try a manual update or tell your friend that he/she should join your world. 
---
I had a similar problem but closing and starting fo76 fixed it for me
---
The Brotherhood should take over the Easton Regional Penitentiary. 
---
Those Prison guards are flipping useless...... the amount of times Mad Dog Malone Escapes.
---
Yup, if someone did it on the server you  get the reward xD it's nice but when I actually wanna do it I need to change server.
---
I run a bloodied handmade but only because I've never gotten a legendary fixer.
---
But I personally prefer the handmade because I like aiming manually. And the fixer/combat rifle has a weird handling which I don't really like
---
Same. First time I've lost all my weeklies at once. I've vowed not to spend a dime on 76 anymore. If they ever gave us the option to play this completely offline hosting our own servers, that would be my sole reason to spend again, otherwise I'm done with these jokers
---
Just swerve them.  I’ve done one NW this whole event and still 6 places ahead on the board.
---
You can do this on the well and sink(legendary run) too(indoor water next to stove). Spam collect on the pool of water or the stream on the pump. Downside since you are drinking the first one can cause disease as a cook I equip thirst quenched when cooking and have diseases cures ready at all times. Can collect dirty water just about as fast as from Lake/stream or about 15 to 20 each 3 to 5 seconds the water is running. This trick allowed me to move my camp away from lakes/streams and still cook soups and relish.
---
Yes cap limit changes the calculation but i have 3 accounts. So i basically i dont have a cap limit. I invest my caps mostly for weapons in auctions.
---
Here's the thing, before Wastelanders, every human you encountered was someone you'd lived with for years in the vault. I RP'd that I knew them and they were off doing their own thing, or being directed by the Overseer same as I was. 
---
So shooting at them should have been rare. As they were your 'friends and family' technically. 
---
With Wastelanders, we now have other factions returning, so that person actually can be a 'stranger' and a 'danger' to you. So it makes more sense we'd see more PvP at this stage, from an immersion perspective. 
---
Anyone getting upset over being killed is simply playing the wrong game. Getting upset over your murderer taking your dropped loot is also not something to get bent over. 
---
Provided it happens within context and isn't a case of stalking and griefing. 
---
Killing others when you encounter them, or when they attack you, isn't griefing by any stretch of the term, it's simply playing the game as it was designed. 
---
Continuously killing them when they respawn and don't come looking for revenge is griefing. Following them around and punching/shooting hoping they'll fight back is as well. 
---
That said, most players approach 76 from the perspective of 'we're all friends here mate' and as such, they frown on killing others needlessly. After all, there aren't exactly many humans left, so we need to keep as many alive as possible. Which includes the dangerous and mentally ill ones. ;p
---
It was and (probably) will be a possible unlock during meat week, so look out for that.
---
There is also a plastic version.
---
Oh never noticed. Thanks. I’ll have to check it out. I was co fused like OP as well when I bought the mods I remember
---
44 pistol should fire double action, be changed to 38 cal, have 3/4 its damage, but the same fire rate as the 10mm. 
---
The western should stay right where is.
---
The single action should be a 45 caliber, cut its reload 30%, increase its fire rate 30% (thats what the fancy revolver is), 30% ap recutions and give it all the barrel,grip, and receiver mods as the other revolvers. Lastly add the gammer fan mechanic.
---
Than each revolver would have a unique purpose/play style.
---
I've never liked the brotherhood of steel...they wanna take away all the strong tech and use it for themselves...like I could get behind them if they showed up, took all the super strong tech, and destroyed it, but no, they use all the super strong tech to take all the super strong tech...that's how dictatorships start.
---
October 23rd 2077 Those chosen head to vaults, great war starts and ends in 2 hours, the world is officially over.
---
Sometime in 2082 BoS was founded (bethesda retconned this to 2077 directly after the war) It was formed by deserters and became a rogue military unit.
---
By 2093 the brotherhood's numbers dwindle from getting there asses kicked by scorch beasts, they close camp venture
---
2135 Maxson dies of cancer, his son takes over 
---
 2155 the war with the vipers starts in new california Maxson 2 dies, vipers are defeated, some groups flee but they never regain the power they had
---
Anyway fast forward to the sole survivor of vault 111, and his handling withs the brotherhood and institute for that matter, and you see a group that instead of fixing the world, caused it to suffer even longer. I cant get behind a bunch of religious extremist lol
---
Your answers are really aggressiv, please go and play a game for your age.
---
I want it gone for the sole reason of the 20 hour reset timer.
---
20 hours for caps, 20 for bulion, 20 for scrip. Thats 3 things now that i have to track when they reset depending on when i handed something in. At this poing ill need to make an app for my phone to track this shit. It will save me lugging crap to the station only to realise i missremembered when i handed shit in yesterday.
---
And i thought the daily quests reset with the daily chalenenges. They didnt yesterday, what the hell timer is this then? Why is none of this displayed anywhere?
---
Hey there.  I just started the game the other night and have read here on the subreddit  (and your post) to save packs. As a new player (lvl 13), should I save my packs? I feel like it’ll hinder my gameplay without new cards, although I’m kind of confused by the system as it is to be honest. Thanks!
---
Yeah. I got it just because it was a rustic, handmade-looking object for my camp. I'm perfectly happy with it.
---
Sorry the OP was disappointed, though.
---
If it makes you feel better as a new player I feel like the perk packs are there for us and there's not very many for that reason, just a little thing to incentivize a new player like me who just hit 20 and is thinking "aww man 5 levels till another pack". Although I realize I will be 25 before I reach the first perk pack in the legendary run.
---
I'm not sure about those challenges specifically but I had a bunch of challenges on PS4 that refused to complete until I redid them on another character.
---
I partially agree. I would say daily limits really need to go, it's annoying and non functional, but overall limits must remain to prevent inflation of however you call it. 30k caps, 1000 scrips, etc isn't that big of a deal for me, but those 1400 caps per day, 200 gold and 150 scrip are so annoying
---
I usually just drop what i can spare. I made a new character this week and I noticed that you really dont need the help. The game hands you so much sid items that its redicoulus. So dont stress about it. It's about being Nice if anything and then it's the thought that counts anyways.
---
Thats not the problem, because its only says that you cant launch a nuke in the last room when you instert the key card.
---
I never do NW challenges (only take a photo and deploy a camp)
---
Why is anyone surprised?
---
It's just... Nylon
---
I love the game it's just not a free world so once you end the main quest you're done with the game, but I would definitely recommend it, the art is amazing and it's a very well made game. I heard they are making a dlc
---
And then inside the bag is the concrete and cork!
---
I swear the percptibobble perk actually makes them spawn more frequently. 
---
There are 3 spots I check specifically for them and they'd only be there rarely. 
---
If I equip the perk, there is one there every single time.
---
Agree. Also perk coins, sound like we are playing some free to play mobile crap. I'm not the creative kind so I don't have better idee.
---
With fallout 1st I feel like everyone gets shafted.
---
Sounds like someone has never played ARK haha
---
You'll probably lose half your Perk Cards, or some other dipshit stuff like that...
---
It is obvious it reads the data from the machines when the map pops up, or the data is held server side? so it should just give you a list of items and prices. This would make it easier for people to compete if you can see what certain item is selling for across the map.
---
If this is too difficult allow the seller to add a small description example: bubblegum 5c, purified water 1c. 3 star fixer 2000c.
---
My bad; the two golf courses I assumed you were talking about were Whitesprings and the mini-golf course, Hemlock Holes. There are like 20 golf balls at Hemlock Holes, so hit them up if you weren't already!
---
At what SCORE level should I be at now? Really want to max it out before it ends.
---
excellent point!
---
Simply do not do them.
---
I'm really disappointed by the performance of the gauss rifle on this game compared to previous games. If you're on PS4 stop by xa0t1ca's camp (middle o is a zero) and I'll see if I can help find you something that will pack a little more punch ;)
---
Once Console streaming is made available you'll be able to play anything you own.
---
Being part of the "Preview" I've really only console streamed 76 and other titles I have.
---
Giving up S.C.O.R.E. is like tossing the last sip of beer in the bottle...as the great Mike Singletary once said “Just Can’t Do It”
---
Doesn't class freak apply to all mutations? it's supposed to negate negative effects partially, so I think it should apply.
---
I second the avoid getting addicted to fast travel notion.
---
The game is much more fun and immersive before I had the map discovered. Now it feels like I stare at load screens more than I actually play. 
---
I realized I was missing the journey to the destination, missing the randomness of encounters and stumbling on places to loot. 
---
I tried to stop FTing all over the map, if it's within 5 min of walking distance I was just going to hike it...
---
Once you get used to doing it it's hard to go back, so my advice is just don't start. Only FT when it's something urgent like a Scorched Earth event or such.
---
Ever since the update the lag has been unbearable in many situations.
---
I actually like this way, it makes the game a little more difficult. I think the game is too easy, regarding quests and enemies. There is no real challenge fo endgame players.
---
I dressed the astronaut in the Order of Mysteries garb, including amulet, she said it was her favorite.
---
I know. But, it was pointed out by many players that Grounded, as well as Empath, did not get affected by class freak at all. That was a year ago so I'm not sure about now. I may just try it whenever I find a serum.
---
Ive been seeing lots of low level players since starting last week. Half the server is generally 50+ but then the other half tends to be a handful of 0-10's and a few people in the 20's or 30's like myself.
---
That's weird, maybe a bug, I think the best way to know for sure is send a support ticket
---
For us newbies, what is the conversion rate from FU to LU (light units) as I know a tiny candle takes 1%.
---
I tend to drop ammo, water/food, and plans for new people. Its the only things I can really collect now that they can use.
---
I used to do that, but now I have so few left to buy that I find focusing on bases in the lower right corner of the map is more likely to be useful to me.
---
no, the bag(?) or whatever is usually in the tent didn't spawn or glitched out
---
Good one 😂
---
lol, now I wanna do that. hope you don't mind me "stealing" your idea 😁
---
I had pitched the idea to Pete Hines, but you run into issues with legality, licensing and they only hire SAG voice actors unfortunately.
---
I’ll ask her to post some, or do a camper tour.
---
I’ll ask her to post somepics or do a camp tour.
---
I mean, it does sound like something straight outta Vault Tec. experiment textbook.
---
That's right
---
It's nice, now we need something like laughing emote and an emote saying "go away".
---
[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/01/28/bethesda-repatriate-fallout-76-theft-victims-through-in-game-clone-meetups/](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/01/28/bethesda-repatriate-fallout-76-theft-victims-through-in-game-clone-meetups/)
---
That's one of several examples. I think it's happened like 3-4 times from memory.
---
Bethesda as a company is lying to you when they say that they cannot restore your characters or lost items. Customer Support might not be able to do so and might lack the tools, so that could be true as a technicality. However, as a company, they've demonstrated multiple times that they can and anyone that works in IT knows they can too and that it's pretty trivial to do so.
---
Its stupid rare though, I’ve played since beta (1500~ hours) and only got that reward a month or so ago
---
Fixer: more damage, sneak, faster movement, bad recoil. Better of using vats. 
---
Handmade: faster for rate, good recoil, less damage, uses 5.56 ammo. Better for use if hip firing.
---
I'm 260 levels in and had no idea I could do this thanks
---
I wish we did too. I personally prefer the variety of short radio shows and dramas we had in previous games. There area. Few Fallout 76 storytelling podcasts you can also play in the background (mine include: CHAD A Fallout 76 story ) that can give you some variety. We started a writers group who are bringing more stories and radio plays from different authors. The Omega Broadcast is one that launched not too long ago and it really, really good.
---
\*invest!\*
---
Just do the really easy ones. You don't have to do them all to reach level 100. Just make up the score with the repeatable - chances are you would be quicker anyway.
---
I only bother with survive so many minutes, place camp or take photos (the photos you can take while waiting in vault, once it clears just quit out). I will do a rank up if I'm close but otherwise no. I'm level 92 in score, should finish by next weekend max, even without NW stuff. I would still have been fine had I never done any NW.
---
I’m 74 but I see people all over...we have about 4 weeks left
---
Yeah its something to look forward to, nothing beats getting a god roll weapon with perfect  legendary effects only for it to be lvl 1 lol
---
Be up where? It says unlocked on the events page. It will probably be in the atomic shop in a few days, just like the beret was a few days after we unlocked it.
---
Guess he was shitting bricks
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events
---
It doesn’t show it in game so you have to go to the site. If it doesn’t take you directly to the page click “ Learn more “ on the BoS thing.
---
I’m at 56 atm. Might not make it then :/
---
Cosplay as some of the bugs we have where they can see you. They will be amused, cool a fan. Then realise you are pointing out bugs.
---
I'd rather it showed in total how many different kinds of plans there are, not summarizing duplicates. Once traveled to someone's camp who has over 300 plans only to find out they have 10 plans of each ultracite armor pieces and other common shit doubled 5 times..
---
I am hoping they'll include a large portion of "Popular" titles as I'll miss having the Streaming option.
---
Did a private server run last night. White springs, Ohio River, Morgantown high school, Bolton greens, hemlock holes. Picked up 106 golf balls.
---
Why is it taking you 20 minutes to get into the game?
---
Also just drop into Morgantown train yard. There are a ton of locked things there. The responder caches all locked plus a few other boxes and safes.
---
I think that's cause they do. Im also new and having a great time but the devs working hard isn't the same thing as the publisher being fair a consumer friendly company. Bethesda is easily up their with EA and Activision now. They would sell you floppy disk with a picture of the vaultboy on it for Fallout 5 if they could. Its their fiduciary duty to put profitability above all else. Again thats nothing on the devs actually working hard to create and upkeep something that people love, but its only fair to also recognize that Todd Howard would dress up in a clown suit and sodomize an orphanage if it would bring his share holders more money.
---
It's a big bonfire. People can also just craft them in your camp for you. You don't need the plan.id craft you 1 on xbox if you want
---
I'd like that compromise
---
"Hello, I like money!"
---
They already said they are working on this
---
* savage divide.
---
I think that’s a great idea, and more radio options in general would be good.
---
Slightly off-topic, one time while I was playing nuclear winter, as soon as the match started, one of my teammates started playing a creepy old radio drama very loudly over their headset microphone, so that was the soundtrack of the entire match.
---
You know... Clown suit imagery aside... I'm just thinking about how much money I can make selling novelty fallout boy floppy disks. You mad genius.
---
I turn off every single light in their camp when I see overpriced stuff. It's fun to do and I hope that some of them think it's a power issue and try and mess with the generator
---
Your points are valid.  I finished it last night too.  I felt a sense of relief.  Like I didn't have to worry about the daily score.  Every day since it began I completed all dailies.  
---
I feel burnt out too.  Sure I didn't need to grind on retrospect.  But with the looming threat of the challenges bug.  The fact each level was harder than the next.  It was unknown if we even had enough time.
---
Other games allow you to play and play to progress.  You can hop in mid season and catch up with a few long sessions.  The old weeklies are there for the taking.   The issue with the legendary run is that you can just hop in mid way and expect to catch up.  Everything is limited and built for short sessions every day.  It's built to create the fomo a lot of players have had.
---
Everytime I go in I clear the 3 inside. Light the burner. then I jump on the roof where I can see the bridge hub. I kill those 2 and in these 10 times I did it not a single enemy has turned up. If you move forward though near the hub you'll see about 10 ghouls stood together. Just chilling.
---
Not all weapons though. Tried this with my handmade and fixer to no effect.
---
Bethesda said they may add doublesided walls in the future.
---
Right now it still can be done on PC. You need a mod for that. You can delete the mod after you finished your building and all changes will stay.
---
On console I think you nee to destroy the wall with flamethrower trap, create second wall and repair the first one.
---
Munch is a good fella.
---
Was the camp near Foundation with a train car bar?
---
Do the animated cards do anything special?
---
Tell the brotherhood NEVVVVVVAARRR!
---
Now that I am done with Legendary Run I am not gonna touch it again.
---
The only raider i like to see is a dead raider.
---
Hasn’t been announced yet
---
100 mole miner gauntlets and 100 Mister Handy buzzblades
---
The Bethesda fan in me is okay with this but also demands the life of your first born child and 30% of every floppy sold.
---
They have already announced that they are going to allow us to do that again.
---
I read somewhere it was specifically for burrowing enemies. It makes them pop up in that location.
---
... doing what?
---
Just one?  Must have some turbo fert nearby!
---
What irks me is that there's a lot of fun story quests that you can only complete once, then never play again unless you make another character. There should be a way to replay story quests. It would greatly increase replay value.
---
Well I know of at least one dapper dude that has a pristine tuxedo...
---
Except that duped 5.56 ammo plus ammo converters plus hacked ammo factories has made 5.56 ammo pretty worthless too.
---
So you already have it? What’s the big deal?
---
You would if you knew what a new york reload was
---
It was never all events. Just public.
---
I typically scrip bloodied things that level , junkies are easier to use while leveling up.
---
I'm UK but I play 1am to 5am. Add me if you like, PSN:Shablagoobuddy
---
Seriously? I feel like this game holds your hand wayyyy too much.
---
Mhm, the player base as a whole is going to crash after this legendary run. Bethesda turned Score into Chore and now no one is going to want to log in for season 2. 🤣👍
---
Yeah Im not a fan of trading. I like selling via the vendor (I like the cha-ching of someone buying something), but not interested in getting into swaps and trades
---
Sorry, mate. I can't get anyone pregnant. When I ejaculate, a worm hole opens up straight into:
---
A. The anus of a loved one or someone you hate.
---
B. Elon Musk's coffee creamer. 
---
C. Nothing. Existence is meaningless. 
---
D. Somehow, all of the above.
---
E. *Grunt*
---
I'm all about open world adventures.
---
Well, I'll play nuclear winter to discover all holotapes and terminals, amazing stories
---
I hate the currency limits too but in this game if I had unlimited space I'd have godroll stuff right and be bored and not play. They can't keep up with content to keep us playing naturally
---
Both. I think Bethesda both lowered the concrete goal and then donated at the end of it to get us the goal. No way we donated just 1 scrap over the goal.
---
I found a use for the ammo converter too.
---
Pumping out ass tons of fuel. 😁
---
Don’t worry about maximizing a build until your around 80 or 100. 
---
Just pick a weapon you enjoy and get it’s perks that increase damage.
---
Bloody mess also helps.
---
What kind of weapon do you use mainly?
---
Also, you can swap happy camper for something else when not in camp or workshop.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
That site is to plan your build. Click each enter and go through the cards you like to make a build or find another pre-made build that specializes in a weapon you want to use. The max each special can be is 15. Once done look down the page and there's a road map. It tells you what to get each level.
---
And the people 200+ levels above me who steal my workshop.
---
You probably know this already, but just in case not - you can disable the unique power armor display for HP / AP / etc and have the interface appear the same way as not wearing power armor. That change didn't make me start loving power armor but it did make it possible for me to use it occasionally ;)
---
Check this site out: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
You can play around with the SPECIAL points and cards and see what kind of build you might want to put together.

Dang, almost 800 upvotes just for taking a screen shot of the atom store? Is that like a secret score challenge? 🤣 I gotta get in on this racket.
---
&gt; What kind of weapon do you use mainly?
---
Machete with Serrated.
---
Hunting Rifle
---
10mm pistol.
---
And 50 Mole Miner Gauntlet plans.
---
And here I am only putting in around 10-20 not so common plans and throwing away the chaff. xD
---
Yup..I did the bozo thing of after getting my free set of ultracite PA after compleating the BOS quest I excitedly went home and took out my other full sets of PA from my stash box ..was going sell the parts of 2 of them for caps &amp; stash space and leave the frames outside of the Wayward..got done just as a nuke warning flashed... Brilliant I thought, baptism in fire..got outside dropped the 2 frames (I thought) and fast traveled to the SBQ...to discover I only had an empty frame in my inventory..FT'ed back but 'poof' gone, did I feel sick or what!..
---
Lesson: rename your shit immediately!! 🥴
---
Bug in the coding of the machine.  Bethesda made programming. Just hope they don’t make a communist vending machine that sells your items and gives you nothing.
---
That was poetry sir.
---
You should switch out happy camper for tenderizer, just when you’re away from your camp
---
There were other deep cover operatives placed within the Vault?
---
*Hello.....Member*
---
Yeah, I’m with you on that one. A cleaner version of the white fridge (heck, even the dirty version) and I’d be all over it, but the steel one doesn’t look right in any camp I’ve seen it. Too damn shiny.
---
Do you have camera film / ammo in your inventory? If not craft some, then go to overseers home :)
---
Also a lot of your cards are for different weapon types, once you get to about lvl 100 you’re gonna need to decide what you like to use the most and by 200 you gotta have a build somewhat made cause xp drops off fast
---
Are low lvl weps valuable? Ive got a lvl15 Bloodied/Vats Crit/FR 10mm I've been using since forever as it still does decent damage.
---
What is haft?
---
they will just port it over to the new consoles. no big huge changes.
---
They both support backwards compatibility, so shouldn't be an issue :-)
---
Never done a NW daily either and I'm on 79. Also only do the level up 3 times per week for the weekly challenge as im over 300 and its too much to ask to do it every day. There's still a double score weekend coming up.. people who have blasted through the season already deserve to be burned out.
---
The I'm sorry emote should be the most used emote by Bethesda employees
---
I log out before too, it can still happen at any point!
---
I don’t see much point in happy camper tbh, unless you’re spending hours working on your camp
---
Same with caps, xp for ranking up the legendary run, etc. I still think the legendary run should gain at least a small chunk of xp for any activity/quest completion or have some points go towards it from legendary kills.
---
I got mine from the campfire tales event
---
Should probably get barbarian if you like one handed melee
---
Yup it's fun as fuck lol
---
I'd pay for a middle finger one.
---
I personally like the extra kick the fixer and combat rifle have over the handmade. Feels weightier. Especially when suppressed, the Handmade feels weak.
---
Wow. What would you want for that instigator?
---
Nothing
---
I'm a posh Raider, I only wipe my arse with Pre War money....
---
I mean look at Destiny, as far as I know destination materials have a cap of like 10,000, which unless you play religiously every day, all day, and every week you’re still not even gonna come close to it, and people come back daily to do more and get more stuff, because it doesn’t hurt to be ready and have materials ready for new releases or new events. It’s a pain having to drop off only a couple of stashed legendaries per day just to make sure I get all the scrip I can out of the vendor. The other day I had to buy a cheap 1 star legendary out of someone’s vending machine because I still had 5 scrip left to claim and my 3 stars couldn’t be traded in. Such a ball-ache.
---
Well raiders at this time period don’t have the luxury of being sophisticated with their life style. The bombs fell not long ago and everything is in ruins. 
---
Johnny is the only one as of yet to be in a tuxedo.
---
You cannot damage another player's camp. They changed this mechanic a while ago. Recently, they changed explosive bait to where it cannot cause damage as well. The only way to damage someone's camp is to lure mobs or nuke it.
---
Microsoft is better for gaming as a whole right now but I suspect that's only because they lost this console generation so hard. They desperately need to look like the people's champion for however long it take them to put out some good new IPs because they've already lost so many people by failing to even approach Sony's onslaught of high quality exclusive titles. They've only rallied against platform division because it stopped favoring them.
---
nah their servers cant count that high
---
At the start they were easy to come by, you could even buy from the Enclave bunker. Much rarer now as stated.
---
Yo, feel free to join us on discord, we are a big enclave group, and we always help new people with whatever we can and whatever they need. [https://discord.gg/PYXVKt](https://discord.gg/PYXVKt)  . Much love, Hades
---
It is an exploit. I do not recommend it, but if you do keep in mind:  
---
\* it only takes one player to see it, take a printscreen and report you to get banned over it. I have not read about anybody getting banned over it but if they're visible and in your camp, it is very easy for other players to send proof to BGS.   
---
\* As far as I understand, the program to catch dupers is able to filter out players who have more than X of Y item. So if you gain too much ammo in a short time, this program might pick you up.  
---
\* Same might be true for blueprints. It might be very easy for them to check who has the blueprint. So best to delete it when done.
---
=&gt; this is all speculative but it just seems very easy to track players down with ammo machines or blueprints.
---
I found it really boring for some reason. :(
---
totally agreed i get swarmed by legendary items these days but i don't have enough inventory and stash space to store them... my daily scrap limit is instantly reached and the next problem is that the total limit of 1000 scrap isn't enough
---
Yeah same. 
---
That could work for me if they never plan on removing them fully.
---
Nothing really. Your ign?
---
Hey, feel free to join us on discord [https://discord.gg/PYXVKt](https://discord.gg/PYXVKt) , we are one of the biggest (if not the biggest) enclave group of fallout 76, ranging on all 3 platforms , and we can help you with your build or just help you out in the game with whatever you need and we can give.
---
Hey, you can join us on discord at [https://discord.gg/PYXVKt](https://discord.gg/PYXVKt) , we can help you with advice, even though the vault raids are no longer in the game, you can grow with us. We range on all 3 platforms and are one of the biggest fo76 communities out there
---
Jesus. You don’t need to do the NW daily to make it to the end and how the hell does it take you 20 minutes. 
---
I run at 8 mbps and I get into matches in 5 minutes tops. 
---
The only NW dailies I have ever did was set up camp and take a photo along with some lockpicks ones.
---
I’m currently at 93 in the run.
---
Are people still keen on 120 (minus travel cost) caps?! It’s an easy to complete event for the daily, but come on - a hundred and twenty caps??? That’s farmed in like a minute anywhere
---
Ok will do
---
Neh, shoot first. Ask later. Raider style.
---
soo good xD
---
So much hostility towards a 16 yr old kid
---
It really depends on what I have in my inventory, but usually Louisville weapons and armor if I happen to have any, water, right away, stem packs,, weird food like scorch beast heart, and plans, sometimes lockpicks, now that I have like 200 of them.
---
That'll teach him!
---
This happened to me a while back, but only once.
---
How do you swap cards? I don't have tenderizer
---
Omg you’re a genius and I love you.
---
Caps are not a rare sight in games like these. 
---
Problem is them being so disgustingly low. 
---
Even runescape, the greatest grind of all time, has a gold cap. It’s just so high up that most players never see it. 
---
But these limits are reached within a few hours. 
---
It *prevents* people from playing. It’s so weird. 
---
They should try it out without the caps in PTS. See the response. And then decide. 
---
I don’t think it has the effect they want.
---
Hopefully Daily Ops changes that, that is really what I am betting on. If daily ops doesn't come through I don't even know if I'll keep playing other than to do the new quests and than log off.
---
But i heard something about that only the 100 most popular ps4  games will be available from the start. So i'm wondering if i wait till Christmas to get the ps5, that i wont be able to play fo76 for some months
---
And then there’s the waves of molerats...that last one is a tunneling SOB. I agree with you, if they don’t show they shouldn’t count as enemies
---
It’s infuriating that the devs are *still* ignoring explosive weapons. You don’t cut from 100% to 20% damage then not try and set it right. Fat man; missile launcher; broadsider; M79 grenade launcher; auto grenade launcher. I want to use these guns, they look fun. We should be bringing this up repeatedly, but it’s like people have just shrugged their shoulders and accepted it’ll never be fixed. 
---
We really need another frank Q&amp;A with the devs from someone who plays the game. Not the vague, softball puff pieces you get from Quakecon.
---
I had a PS4. Indeed had some good exclusives but I bought a Xbox because of GamePass. Now I only play on PC but if I were to buy a next gen console it would be the new Xbox.
---
Picked up a max level junkies explosive railway rifle today for 500
---
Good questline ending, but otherwise it was grinding with zero creativity. Also it really lacks charm since the Order has died out. And to be fair the no nature of it is terrible. No surprise obviously but its still bad. Dont think I ever used OoM items either, theyre weak.
---
GOD BLESS AMERICA!
---
GOD BLESS THE ENCLAVE!
---
Ah. I can't help then. I would've given you my spare set had it been PS4. Hope you manage to get a new pair soon.
---
Just keep both consoles until it does work, if it doesnt at the start.
---
Dont forget, only supporting 100 doesnt mean only 100 will work, just means 100 have been tested and they will try to resolve issues with them.
---
is this like 8k, what graphics card are you running? I barely get 60 frames on 1080p!
---
Special attack: Holds you upside down by the ankles and shakes all your atoms out
---
Been requested since day one mate.
---
***This is the warden of Eastern Regional Penitentiary.***
---
PC Steam player here. I had this same issue. My solution to get it working was
---
1.Exit game completely
---
2.Join random world
---
3.Immediately enter hospital and rush to objective
---
4. Access terminal and ONLY analyze blood. If you receive an error when trying to analyze, go back to step 1 and repeat.
---
5. If blood successfully analyzes, insert T-Cell.
---
Like Vim and sunset Sarsaparilla
---
Unfortunately, it seems the game only saves your progress and current inventory when you fast travel, and when you leave the server. If you get disconnected before you’re able to do this, any new items will be lost.
---
This.  Lol
---
I'll bite, what's a new york reload?
---
They better not mess with my guy, The Mayor of Grafton either.
---
Surely you mean you put an arrow in the ammo converter?
---
Annoying isn't it, bye bye gun :-)
---
I understand that but these are items that are displayed in my pip-boy and not dropped that are being removed when I get disconnected from servers.
---
The server doesn't auto save, it's basically saying you never had those weapons to begin with.
---
I've lost legendaries and other stuff to this. I even recorded it the last time it happened so when people ask me why this game sucks I don't have to argue anymore I can just show them. 🤣
---
Try a Bloodied Dragon or Black powder rifle w/ associated perks. with a crit I can one shot lv 60 scorchbeasts (granted I'm at max adrenaline)
---
I had someone flaming me hard yesterday for claiming this bug still exists. It took me 20 seconds searching to find reports daily of it. I'm sorry. Bethesda will do 0 things for you. Fuck we better pray some duper completes cork for us or they auto complete it like concrete or i know ill never complete without paying for it.
---
It's PrivateHudson78.
---
That low a lvl no. It's ok not valuable to save once you max cards out after level 50 because if you are lucky enough to get the same one and have all the perk cards then they get deleted or wasted. You so t have to worry about that anytime soon so go ahead and open them
---
I think perks that would make armour pieces redundant is a bad move
---
That’s so tragic tho why set up a game like that 😂 *feels your pain*
---
Most so called Raiders are little baby's that won't even build an ammo machine at their camp. 🤣 Disappointing really.
---
NiNe_LightNinG is my ign. Just join my world
---
Ther real question is why after almost two years that the game's been live, throwing painted stuff on the ground has to destroy the whole thing rather than just removing the paint...
---
I have never bought or applied a single weapon/armor skin because of this. I have lost count of the times the game decided it was time to clean my inventory during combat situations. 
---
Use VATS&gt;VATS targets wrong enemy&gt;Nope the fuck out of VATS&gt;nothing happens&gt; press more B&gt; Game opens the Pip-Boy and starts throwing shit away. It's a fundamental law of the Wasteland.
---
Does the fridge actually work like a fridge or is it just for show?
---
Not sure why you’re getting downvoted. The perk card system is a bad fit for a multiplayer game like this. It makes specialisation pointless as you can basically flit between builds just by changing cards in and out. Plus it has made weapon balance an absolute nightmare (part of that is due to dev team’s inexperience, admittedly.)
---
while we're at it a golf club skin that is a hockey stick.
---
From the context, just change to a gun with a full clip, reload them later!
---
Some good photos here to choose from.
---
https://joke-battles.fandom.com/wiki/Todd_Howard_The_Liar
---
The trigger is essentially random. I havent gotten the bug this patch, yet, but 100% I only play public, and am NEVER online during the reset for hours after even cause I work. I've lost probably 6k score cause it was during the last double week.
---
Bethesda man, they wanted to make a different game and boy did they make it different. None of the convenience of modern games.
---
Molerats are the worst offenders!
---
If you have no atoms he auto subscribes you to 12 months of Fallout 1st
---
Accidentally sold a Junkies explosive Vats 25% ap cost 10mm for 500 caps earlier. Didn't realize I listed it until after someone purchased it.
---
Some people like it because it’s an extra warning before discarding things you like
---
I hate that VATS thing, you have ghouls rushing at you and your'e stuck in your fucking pip boy or trying to place your fucking camp while being beaten to death :-)
---
I keep those in my inventory in the hope that maybe, just maybe, one day we’ll be able to zoom in with a pair of binoculars. It’s become an in-joke amongst the people I play with at this point.
---
Better hope they auto complete cork, give us 130,000,000 free cork like they did concrete.
---
When you turn your light on, your character will have a light coming off of them and you'll be using the PA flashlight, the pip boy flashlight doesnt come on at all
---
Combat shotguns have different skins.
---
The warning can be made to appear regardless, it's not necessary to destroy the object to put a warning when throwing painted stuff on the ground
---
Mag*. But you can do that or just toss it and grab a new one
---
I got the urban and forest scout mask the white powder whitesprings and bos jumpsuits all at once
---
It looks cool in a stealth character.
---
i would also like to have specific bundles i can sell to people. for 10 caps a 10mm pistol, some bullets and a few stims.
---
Bruh I’m blackout until saturday
---
If the nuke has been launched from that silo on that server, the game won't let anyone into that silo.
---
If you launched a nuke from that specific silo on any server within an hour (I dont remember what the personal cool down is), it won't let you launch the nuke from the control room, but it will take your keycard
---
29
---
Thank you very, very much!
---
Bethesda ripping people off? You realize you're playing a Fallout game, right?
---
Thank you, I posted this yesterday in another sub but couldn't explain myself better due to language. They are switched for me too, I can craft the standing one, but the one that I see (known) is the sitting. I bought the standing plan from a player and didn't learned it yet bc I wanted to know if somebody had the same issue.
---
No problem
---
Please do an update when the tomatoes grow!
---
And if they keep delaying everything. Then the loadouts will come next year in summer
---
That is, until season two starts, right?
---
lol
---
Everything of value has pretty much been duped. I'm just saying there's no need to hoard caps, then ask Bethesda to increase the limit.
---
Only if the rewards are a lot better. Just wanted to grind this season because it was the very first one.
---
The event has to be broken sometimes with no way of completing it or be an ammo sink with little or no reward at the end
---
Leader of the Pack only gives 1 Star items as they are 1 Star enemies
---
Who wants to fight a boss that's lazy and doesn't do anything?
---
This is an awesome post I hope it's noticed.
---
They're terrible some of them- Poseidon plant being one of the worst imo. Constantly, constantly enemy either get stuck beyond the blast doors or simply run the opposite direction down the street, never to be seen again. Takes like 20mins to do a simple defend event.
---
It would be slick if they took the 7 daily limits and turned them into a single equal weekly limit at least so that those of us that aren't able to play a few hours every single day aren't bogged down when we do have time. You still have people playing every single week but this way we feel like we can maximize our time played even though there is still a time gate that bethesda loves.  
---
Obviously no limit is best, bigger limits are better but this seems like an easy quick fix.  Like just have everything reset with the legendary run weekly timer. Instead of every player having 5 different timers they need to keep track of
---
It’s not hoarding caps. I have to needlessly buy things I don’t need just to keep earning caps at the normal pace that the game hands them out. Do I need to try serum recipe? Nope. Do I buy them at 17.5k a piece when I get close to the cap? Sure do. I can drop 30k in caps and hit the cap again in 23 days. Faster if I sell something from my vending.
---
I don't bother with the defends unless their super mutants for the same reason. however if you leave the defend untill it turns into a re take then they are all out in the open and the 4 waves of mole rats tunneling to Spain are all.on the surface ready to be exploded.
---
When does the run end? I only started it last week and goddamn I want that captain cosmos PA
---
They are horrible! I love the way they can tunnel through the ceiling or floor of a multi story structure?!?! 
---
Unless there's something in the lore about molerats having quantum relocation capability that I missed, how about if they tunnel through ground only?
---
That seems, unlikely.
---
Especially when %99 of the stuff I get from the purveyor are %100 useless.  
---
I always save the purveyor till I'm about to log off, since I know it's going to make me want to log off once I see what it gave me.
---
They spawn inside the blast doors (!) that not everyone even has the perk cards to unlock. Whoever designed that needs a demotion! At least we figured out that the floater grenades can reach them, since they have an area effect.
---
I already posted about daily ops lately that I honestly don't hope for much. I believe the day they'll introduce 'em at PTS (kinda strange they didn't launch testing yet actually) there's gonna be yet another shitstorm of negative feedback because of its grindiness and lack of thought out rewards, which will of course lead to yet another round of content postponing. Also, we already got legendary perk system delayed for more than two updates because of how poorly conceived it actually was (and still is. They'd better come up with something completely new by the next round of testing, 'cause hell they ignored A LOT of pointed out issues with the latest updates for that system)
---
That's true, the workaround that everybody uses is just to abandon the event until it is taken over, and then you only have one wave to fight. That makes it pretty clear that the event design is a fail.
---
Common advice is to use VATS with the gauss shottie, seems to be bugged in a good way. But in my experience its very hit or miss, literally. Either things explode or barely wing them, not much in between. I've put mine up to concentrate on getting my heavies sorted out, wasn't worth fiddling with at the time. I did the same with the gauss rifle on my alt, seems to be a gauss thing.
---
Most builds I know utilize LCK, STR and AGL with moderate INT, CHR. But you can swap points any time after reaching lvl 50.
---
Not going to happen. 
---
Everytime someone opens the map the game would have to pull the inventory list from ALL vendors currently on the servers.
---
The engine isn't particularly great with updating the map in real time as is so this would put even more strain on the whole thing.  
---
Ever noticed how the nuke warning goes off, you open the map and the blast radius circle isn't anywhere to be found? Imagine that but all the time.
---
You need to charge the Gauss Stotgun to do the damage shown in inventory. Without charging the Gauss Shotgun does less damage than the Combat Shotgun.
---
yep they’re a business spoiler alert all businesses are motivated by profit. but once they make a stance like that they can’t go back or everyone would call them out. nothings a better motivator than defeat, if the tides don’t turn this upcoming console generation they will soon. Microsoft learned from this and Sony continues to tout the same bullshit. Playstation got where they are by beating microsoft in the places they failed but now it’s the other way around. that’s just my opinion though man. none of the ps4 exclusives really appealed to me except spiderman and i’d be lying if I said when I got my new console i wasn’t considering a ps4 solely because of that so i’m sure there are people who choose a console based on exclusives.
---
What happens when you go inside &gt; downstairs &gt; talk to robot?
---
Start a new character, join the responders. Done.
---
I already do that
---
Okay. I hate NW just the same, and I only started playing it for the legendary run, but now I use the opportunity to unlock a few cosmetics every now and then (I'm at overseer rank 20 right now). I never go for challenges like 'Kill a player' (I think I have not killed more than three over all those levels...), and will do the rank up challenge only if I'm close or I can do it by opening perk cards on my main char that started out with 130 cards. :-)
---
If I can slowly rank up this way to 50 or even 100 until the end of season four, I'm fine, but there's no real harm if I throw the towel at some point.
---
for real...using 5mm sucks sometimed bcos everyone charges so damn much for the ammo like im just not gonna buy it lol
---
Can't you get it on another character?
---
As much as I agree about some quests that are actually good, I don't think any of them would make for a good replayable content since the rewards just aren't there and the replayability is quite questionable once you know the story.
---
What this game needs is some sort of randomly generated dungeons with infinitely scalable difficulty and rewards. (That will also allow for chance to infinitely upgrade your gear to be able to climb ever upwards in difficulty) That would be something I'd gladly go for if it really will become challenging at some point.
---
It takes 8 minutes. 
---
Start a new character, leave the vault, run to the moonshiners shack, lumber mill, wixon homestead, then overseers camp. Craft a weapon and armor piece, walk into the wayward and skip through the dialog. Just 8 minutes once a day of walking, you don’t even need to fight anything
---
Hoard scrip for the Horde?
---
If u lost them, cant u just get a second account and play for little boom bam u get them and then get a friend or someone u trust to hold them and switch accounts!
---
Iunno, a Gargantuan Tick would be more terrifying.
---
Dude you have no idea what your talking about
---
RIGHT? Fallout happens in the future and my grandma has a digital picture frame. I'm sure a few of these survived the great war? 
---
Speaking of future and tech. Why the heck do we not have solar panels and batteries for power?
---
I started playing again after a few months. Currently lvl 130 and using maxxed ultracite armor. Where do I find T65?
---
Do you know if items stored in the fridge use camp budget?
---
See I haven't gotten it either.  Ever. I always load into a private world first, in case the challenge is to do something that is spawn dependent. Then if I feel like, I hit the NW challenge, then end on a public world.
---
I'm also always offline during the reset, because I really only have time in the evenings.
---
But I think you are correct, and its random. Or there is some specific issue, or series of issues, that trigger it...but if that's the case, I don't think anyone has nailed down why yet.
---
The cause is incompetence and a 20y/o game engine.  
---
The solution is for people to take some damn pride in their work and provide a little quality assurance.
---
Yes they could have. They chose not to, they seem to avoid miniupdates and hot fixes. Hopefully the next one they will.
---
I use explosives &amp; heavies and a two shot m79 is the most fun you can have with a gun on this game, trust me.
---
start finding bobbleheads and keep the explosive 1, get demo expert 5 + adrenaline and your golden
---
YOU!!! 😂 This is probably why will never see this feature 😂
---
Message received, scrip box coming to atom shop for 2000 atoms next week
---
Then to your main question, is it tedious? Yes, it’s not ideal, but it is easy. I naturally leveled my normal toon yesterday and then started two new characters, getting the “level up three times” score reward of 1000 (or 1500 score, I can’t remember) in just 20 minutes
---
I have to take low prices. My stash is unbelievably full at all times. I need the vendor items to move quickly to free up space for whichever exciting new legendary might appear next ;)
---
I’m not gonna say I agree with resource limits but I understand them cause it keeps casual players active and prevents hard players from having like 30 BE miniguns and completely flooding the trades and lowering the prices in the market places for such weapons but holy fuck can they do them better.
---
For starters 150 is way to low for scrip and don’t divide evenly. They need to make it 240 and increase the amount 1 and 2 Star armor give 4 and 10 so everything can decide evenly. 6 3 Star weapons or 10 3 Star armor and boom done. It’s gotten to where I don’t even keep 2 Star armor can you can’t really use it to break things down the way you want
---
Second take a For honor approach. For honor gives new daily orders every day to gain steel and it’s real simple stuff like play 2 matches then new major orders every 2 days which give more xp. Well on the weekends when most people play anyway they do new major orders on Thursday so you can have new ones for Friday, Saturday and Sunday. 
---
There’s 0 reason limits can’t be set up like this in 76 so on Saturday they refill like every 8 hours or something and you can get 3 times that day for a total of 450 with the current or 720 with what I suggested changing them too. This means even a casual player can get a ton of scrips when they have the chances to play and wouldn’t need to play daily
---
Yea this log in every day shit is for mobile games and i'm getting worn out.I don't feel like i'm playing for fun sometimes just logging in to get those limits. Make all the score stuff weekly and let us scrip and bullion as much as we want.
---
100% this
---
At level 538, it takes forever to level up. I did 8 Encryptid and a Queen last night. With a full building team and I barely got 1/2 way to 539.
---
So yeah, I use my alt to get the level ups done.
---
Eeeehhh. I don’t know about no limits, but if we could not have a way to keep grinding maybe with finishing returns or something. Gotta keep things a little rare...
---
You can force the server to save your progress / inventory by dropping something. Anything will do: one bullet, spoiled meat, a worthless plan... 
---
So: after you have picked up all the loot from Uranium Fever, drop one item, then, after walking to the next workbench and scrapping everything, drop another item, and you will be safe.
---
I got one first try
---
It's always easy even with you main character. The point is that it's tedious
---
The boys at crater still haven’t forgiven me for fucking over meg.
---
I like 'em because now I have a three stage setup going for easy meals every time I visit camp: three corn - &gt; hit up my three rain collectors for six dirty water - &gt; go and cook some corn soup.
---
Yeah, while this would be a nice feature, I'm not willing to sacrifice load time. The map is one of the few things in the game that loads quickly and it needs to stay that way. Also, visiting camps is fun to see what people create.
---
I have no character slots left. The character I'm playing is over 200. Every day I go looking for the WS sentry bots and they've already been blasted to pieces. The deathclaws have all been declawed. There's someone permanently in Westek......
---
was hoping they would forgive me for taking all the gold when I hit ally but no
---
Where do you find coffee in game?
---
I’m sure you’re right. But if you need the right legendary, bobblehead, and stack of perks to make things fun, isn’t that pretty much an admission that these guns are broken?
---
The limits are there more so to keep people from rushing the game. If there is no limit and you can buy everything then there is nothing left and no reason to keep playing so if they removed it from daily they would have to make an over all limit. This has been done with caps as 30000 is the max you can hold on one character so they could remove the daily with no problems unless it's a server thing but then WOW would also do daily limits because server and they don't. So yes I agree.
---
Classical "problem of the last alien"....
---
5 minutes of work isn't tedious.
---
As someone who works and has a family, like most people. I don't have the option to play every day, or even as much as I would like to.  
---
   So when I do have time I max out all the limits in an hour or two then struggle with the weight limits the rest of the time.
---
At the very least they should increase all the limits.
---
I've started a auto pistol character and would like a Gauss Auto mod if there isn't one.
---
I've looked up the plans and didn't see it listed.
---
Get a Bloodied Deathclaw gauntlet and the bloody mess perk :D
---
But then they don't get their hands on our tasty tasty technology.
---
Thats a great suggestion! Currently no auto gauss pistol.
---
Some time last year I thought I would give Fallout 4 a try again and I just couldn't play it (I played Fallout 4 for 3 years and I really liked it). It was very lonely and I missed all the quality of life improvements 76 has.
---
 😂
---
Every time I here Meg in game, I think of Meg from Family Guy.
---
Sony started with the top 100 and have been working backwards testing each game.
---
I agree, it is very tedious. Admittedly I do not create a new character to get the level up and I'm at 525. I have played for nearly 2300 hours on my one and only character and at this point just refuse to make a new character for the sake of that challenge. 
---
It seems to me that if the challenge system is what they're choosing to have us do, they should get creative with it and not regurgitate the same challenges day in and day out. Give us some variety. 
---
It is emblematic of their overall lack of creativity with this game in general.
---
At the moment i use my mules for it. It helps, that i have two accounts tho. All my mules are located at whitesprings station. I log on with a mule (with only inspirational perk on lvl 1 or 2) and my second or third char. I run over to WS entrance and throw a molotov at the sentry bot. I die with my mule and switch to my other char to kill the sentry. Between the levels 1-10 thats mostly a guaranteed levelup. If not, i repeat it with the other two sentrys around the corner.
---
There are no ultracite headlamp mods or paints. And the ones you don't have, probably the targeting hud, are like a .8% drop chance
---
Yeah. I did start another character too to hold all my stuff and it does seem easier now. Or maybe I’m just remembering wrong? But yeah, being nice is all that matters. I just like trying to foster a good community. It’s mainly good people with just a few douchebags.
---
That's not true at all.
---
Lmao 😅😅😅😅
---
I saw it on this site
---
https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Ultracite+Power+Armor
---
Takes me like 5 minutes to get into a game and 2 minutes to complete most challenges.  Really only level up and kill NPCs can take more then 1 round to complete.
---
Didn’t think about lockpicks. I’ll leave a few from now on. They’re one of those items I forget about. Same as gunpowder.
---
Shiiiit, I drop most the legendaries these days next to the scrip machine...
---
Eternal fame, glory and afterwards, an existential crisis.
---
The reason to keep playing is to enjoy the fallout gameplay with friends, have fun blowing shit up and killing enemies with the added fun of a friend seeing the fun shit you can get up to!
---
The limits just make it HARDER to get to the fun parts!
---
Just be happy with the deal...

This article says Arabians are the best horses in the game and that the red one was a gift for PS users during beta.  https://www.gamesradar.com/red-dead-online-best-horses/
---
And that's exactly what I was told back then too.   So idk wtf you are talking about.
---
That site is wrong.
---
I literally stop playing every day when I reach the caps.
---
If they’re trying to drive engagement and participation in events etc., these caps are antithetical to that goal.
---
I have no clue what that site is. But most of not all of those paints and mods are not in 76.the only paints you can get for ult are from nw or the atomic shop
---
And most if those mods arnt in game either
---
The power plat in the mire, one of the Enemy spawn points is UNDERNEATH THE POWER PLANT, you can't kill them!
---
No, lots of sarcasm intentional, in my post
---
Okay, thanks. Do you know where I can find an up to date list of available mods for the ultracite armor then?
---
They said they want to collect feedback on this season before starting the new one so they can make changes. 
---
Instead of ranting about why you think *will* happen, why don’t you submit a feedback ticket and let them know what you think *should happen*?
---
I made a previous post about that suggesting challenges with much higher score rewards but the challanges could require more steps. Like powering up a power station or the excavator at Mount Blair or the food or ammo stuff at the workshops. Since it's more than just "claim a workshop". Or maybe do a silo or something. Something that actually makes people take part in the mechanics they added to the game because I never see people powering up Mount Blair and I only ever did the power station for the generator plans. 
---
They could do a lot more with the challenges and score than juat level up everyday or chew gum or collect resources or critical hits or craft ammo. I'm a melee build. I switch to guns for some of those but it's not hard or fun, just annoying
---
A government source said ministers were now drawing up plans for the move - to ease pressure on emergency services.
---
It seems the console for the quest bugs out on a world after someone has completed the quest for the first time. Seems to break quest progression on that world until that world resets.
---
Because of this you should have much better luck trying to complete this on a private game since you'll get a fresh world. I have done this successfully after I was stuck the same way.
---
Lemme know if it doesn't work.
---
Now this is a quality post. Take my upvote!
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ultracite_power_armor
---
I have no idea where that other site got it’s info. It looks like they cut and paste from Fallout 4 mods, which gave bonuses for paint, but that isn’t a thing in 76.
---
during meat week you can get extra scrip when you hand in your prime meat at the hourly BBQ.
---
And as mentioned, the daily quests. Yes they are boring but when you look at the treasury notes, scrip and reputation you get from them in a very short time, they are worth it. Because of this "time efficiency", it are among the first things I do when starting to play.
---
You take you’re reasonable comments and get the hell out sir.
---
You dont need to complete the nw daily...
---
There is technically. Though I do agree a FFA and TDM should be added.
---
I´d love to have that job
---
the machine is designed to be a metaphor
---
If you found a placed LPI floater grenade, you would know that you can't even pick them up
---
Just want a higher skill cap man how'd we go from fallout 4 where you can get all skills to on level 50
---
I picked up 3 of them in the linked clip dude
---
I hate the gating on the legendary run. When I heard of it I was happy cause I thought could play for hours on it. The daily stuff is middlefinger to me. Weekly okay, cause could catch up during the weekend or a day off
---
Working on it, i have a few mods installed so i physically cant log into NW unless i daisable them, but thats sounds like more hassel than its worth so i just dont bother with them
---
I know I enjoy going solo I do pretty good when solo. But solo vs a team is near impossible.
---
You're just trying to get rid of Pita before we inevitably get roped into a quest involving her. So yeah, good idea. They really are just kind of there. All the time and effort used to create and voice them for what, maybe five minutes worth of interaction.  Seems like a waste since you only visit Regs if you want to buy something.
---
Bethesda says a lot. Given there is only a 2 week break between the seasons, I don't know how much feedback you think they will bother to implement or listen to. The datamined rewards already show that the preparation of the 2nd season (at least in terms of rewards) is already in full motion. Since seasons are a "side-thing", I highly doubt they will bring immense changes to them every time, since they busy working on the other roadmap content, which requires more attention.
---
Why is it that I cannot sell some legendary apparels to either vendor or machine?
---
At PackTray's C.A.M.P., all plans are priced at a modest five caps! That's in addition to our already-low price of one camp per round of ammunition!
---
PackTray KNOWS your time is valuable! That's why he doesn't sell taxidermy plans! He just puts any he finds in the stash box at the Overseer's camp next to The Wayward! It's just another example of The PackTray Difference \[tm\]. Stop by today and feel it for yourself!
---
Awww sheeet, haha, I was kind of hoping they would eventually forgive you after doing like a thousand dailies to reach max rank, feels bad man &gt;.&lt;
---
It's literally just running around, waiting for them to spawn so you can one shot them. 
---
So far the only defense event that is actually any good (I find) is Dolly Sods. It's wide open so the enemies just rush to you, they're generally pretty high level and come in big groups. Coupled with the fact that it's always poison abusers who attack too, the event at Dolly Sods is actually always a blast
---
the season is just here so people spend atoms on it.
---
What’s is stopping you from providing feedback now? You don’t need to wait for the current season to end to provide their feedback so they can make changes. 
---
Maybe you just want to complain, that’s fine. If you want to be productive, submit a ticket.
---
Reeeeè
---
Almost? Have you seen Charleston?
---
I am so glad that I apparently never owned that power plant and have avoided that particular frustration.
---
Please Bethesda, since we are your game testers, listen to your game testers.
---
I'm just really confused on this because I've been playing for months now. Sometimes I don't get to play until an hour before the 8:00 P.M EST reset and I will turn in all my tickets and clean out the gold bullion machine. Then I'll keep playing and get more tickets then do the dailies after 8:00 and turn in 20 more tickets and it will be reset only about an hour after trading my tickets. Not the 20 hours your saying so have I always been glitched and it's just now fixing itself.
---
Uhh inflicting toxic status isn't griefing...
---
That one is my favourite power plant to take in public servers as its so far out of the way, nobody else takes it!
---
Mentions something about me finding a camera.
---
One time...ONE TIME...I sold Ward's missing part to the thief who took it. He reminds me about that every time I visit even though I've turned down the reward for returning it almost every other time. 
---
But yes, you get different dialog. I don't think it has any affect on reputation though, but it's really hard to tell.
---
Guess they fixed it
---
It's not so much this as much as it is when they release new content they expect a certain amount of reinvestment from players into the game in the form of time, resource hoarding can often dramatically shorten the amount of time a returning player has to invest before they can reap the rewards from new content.
---
Always do just in case I can get a good picture.
---
It also rains indoors.
---
Why didn't you simply go to flatwood for the responder quests. You would have made 2 norw levels there. I use the same new character for 3 days usually.
---
Or what?
---
	
---
Why didn't you simply go to flatwood for the responder quests. You would have made 2 norw levels there. I use the same new character for 3 days usually
---
There is. You turn team autofill off before entering to join solo.
---
It's over
---
Oh no no no sir or madam, that would be too game breaking and the veterans would just hoard scrip till we do one of our rare 25% sales or our super rare 50% sales for the purveyor. - Bethesda
---
The real problem is that the moderators of this forum don't do anything about these kind of posts unless you specifically report them.
---
They know players don't read before rage posting, and they basically let others do their job.
---
This. I'm tired of companies trying to force me to play games the way they want me to. It's what I do for fun, and if it isn't fun, then I won't do it.
---
I moved camps post patch and lost about half my stuff. All the water purifiers, all the crops, pretty much everything except the main building.
---
I hate that FO76 is a prequel cuz I feel like Kent wouldnt have been such a bitch had he taken part in setting up the order of mysteries
---
Man lately these have been the only events I've been able to find to complete the daily challenges in a timely manner. 
---
At several points were literally the only events up for well over half an hour.
---
Never got it. I've checked atom shop beforehand, I've been on NW beforehand, I've played directly beforehand, watched the new dailies/weeklies pop up, and I still haven't had this bug. But these superstitions are helping no one (not aimed at you, just this thread and others). 
---
There is no trick here folks. A good trick would be the team fixing it, or at the very-fucking-least compensating. No way can they allow this to carry on into the next season.
---
I bet there will either be a massive gap in between this and the next season for them to try and fix it (they'll say they have fixed it and it won't be fixed), or they'll continue on schedule and you'll be fucked.
---
Feel for all you dudes who are having this problem.
---
if you read on fallout wiki he was killed by olivia
---
I’ve been playing this “level up once” challenge like a rouge lite type game where I only get to one level up, then they get deleted. Never even thought about bringing them up one more level cause just the initial one is done so quickly. But I’ll have to try your suggestion on the next one.
---
I have a full set of that, its beautiful watching everyone limp away from events like line in the sand to the nearest workstation and i can still fast travel
---
That site and everything on it is unfiltered shite.
---
Almost all of the conditional dialogue is screwed up in Wastelanders.
---
It's really bad
---
Where can I find canned coffee?
---
Oh the best part is that when you are indoors, it makes the sound of rain on a rooftop,but it still rains on your face . That means the code to detect whether rain should be hitting the roof instead of your face is in there and it's just not connected.
---
Easily the best use for it. I specifically traded for an excellent flamer when I realized how viable obtaining fuel was now.
---
Yes, for free. Other guy is a goober.
---
Purveyor is bugged to only roll limited effects on a handful of melee weapons.
---
They once again botched keywords
---
Alteratively, with the storage catergory, we should be able to place any down then use the 'lock' button on them to convert them to either stash or scrapboxes, since everything in there acts as a stashbox they should all act as both
---
A 'No mic' emote was datamined in the last patch, hard to tell how far away it is. By the nature of the patch it appeared in, I'd guess it'll be here by Patch 22? But that's just an educated guess, don't quote me on that.
---
Look who is himself in fact looking for up votes and attention with this post..... funny
---
How about a silencer for the revolvers?? The pipe revolver gets a 100pct damage bonus from it. It's a gamechanger for sure.
---
The other ideas look great!
---
Still I don't get why the lore is locked to me behind pvp game mode=/
---
Thought it was worth asking, i couldn't get the daily to trigger unless i had camera film in my inventory :) Not sure how to solve that bug.
---
That’s rough as! No forgiveness xD 
---
On one character I sided with foundation and took all the gold, but it seems like the dialog is the same as before I done the vault raid, but I had a mate saying that he walks around and people call him a legend lol
---
The foundation character was meant to be the good guy, I think I fucked that up, one can only be so good xD
---
Many of the workshops are very unpopular; Bethesda should have plenty of data to show that people are not using workshops, and that is a fail that they could rectify.
---
Watoga, Dyer chemical mine, sugar Grove, or any silo
---
Silos are good, you don't have to launch a nuke, but there are three silos each with lots of bots. Alternatively, Whitespring and Watoga have a lot of bots.
---
Personally I like it. I find having to go to a river and spam collect dirty water annoying. I just have 2 rain collectors at my camp and they fill up pretty quickly so I can empty them pretty much every time I visit my camp. Since getting it I've never had to go collect a ton of dirty water for when I brew alcohol or craft food.
---
Plus it looks cool.
---
I love doing it on uranium fever if too many people turn up, mostly do it for the scrap so just go kill everything else in the mine and collect junk
---
Someone said it is next week
---
The biggest problem is too many players bait and trap the workshops in the forest area to grief the low level players!
---
I sides with the settlers and kept the gold and they still are very friendly to me,it feels like keeping the gold didn’t change a thing.
---
Good point!  Then how about an option to save to gallery?
---
Future Tec Camp bug
---
This is why we all need a global digital currency like bitcoin to do away with the government and bank monoplies, profiting on every move of the money and making the complete transaction to take weeks instead of being settled in seconds.
---
Not as much as I'll be when they up the camp budgets again.
---
I agree, as someone who plays both destiny and ff14. One of the main reasons I enjoy 14 is the pacing on the grind of current endgame gear. I have played Destiny since release and am happy they are reworking the loot system, because for someone like me who has played consistently a couple hours everyday and has every gun in the game it's not hard to farm for rolls hell I don't need to which is why I don't play now.
---
If there was unlimited resources and no scrip caps you would have the same issues still. People would say there's a content draught, nothing worthwhile to farm for, then it would end up like so many other games where the true endgame is just friendship.
---
I don't know which one is right
---
It's a reward. I believe I got it from powering up posidon
---
I think that means something serious is wrong. I've found that when the events stop coming, that is soon followed by the server going down or resetting.
---
It's used by salt lords, its beyond inefficient at actually applying the status effect. But I wouldnt want it out of the game it's hilarious mechanic
---
I love the idea that Mad Dog Malone is just some random ass super mutant and this one random AI will just NOT LEAVE HIM ALONE.
---
You can get an easy five from Liberators outside 76.
---
Kill em all at the Whitespring then server hop.
---
Same here but lvl94, coming to the finish line
---
I'm on PC and am still trying to get the Ultracite Calibrated Shock plans. I did the gold grind to get the Strangler Heart PA plans only to discover I have to do additional grinding to get the Ultracite Calibrated Shock plans. After killing countless SBQ and SB, I wish I could just buy them with gold.
---
Radiation Rumble is your friend.
---
I wear a clown outfit because I waste time farming shit and collecting things when I could just dupe everything and use the gold glitch to skip the grind.
---
Imagine, if you will, a meme.
---
Reddit: Atomic Shop items with useful game benefits are Pay-to-Win and we hate them! You promised you wouldn't!
---
Bethesda: Makes Atomic Shop item with inferior game effects to avoid upsetting the community.
---
Reddit: "The Rain Water Collector is a major ripoff. 500 atoms and it only gives dirty water at a snails pace."
---
Also inflicts the status on yourself which says alot about it lol
---
It's a pretty good piece of gear
---
You play on xbox? We have a decent clan for d2 thats expanded to alot of other games if you're interested.  But back to your post, I would like to see an increase in the currency limit in general still. Maybe increase it by half or double it just to make it feel like I can do so much more
---
But you can't carry duplicates of the same star level you have!
---
But dont you dare even think about changing your name!
---
I tired to point this out weeks ago.  Glad you're at least getting some traction.
---
The system is trash. Punishes you for changing your build after level 50 and punishes you for getting duplicate perk cards in perk packs that then disappear into the ether.
---
It should just be you get a perk coin for every level up after 50. No reason to make it any more complicated.
---
If you want it to be “left be” then remove the video and yourself from the Rage discord. You’re the one who wanted your story heard, and now when people are trying to stand up for you, and are pissed about the disgusting acts done by SH, they’re told to stop. SMH, after all that Ragechronicles and the discord did for you. Bitch, roll out.
---
They're lying to you, they can they just don't want to!
---
I do not know why they nerfed the workshops. They wanted people to use them and fight over them, but by nerfing them they made people lose interest.
---
My biggest problem as a low-level player was trying to hold a workshop and being rolled up on by a squad of high-level players, where there's nothing you can do to defend it. 
---
It used to be that the players had to get to the workbench to contest it, so at least you might have a chance of using defenses, and they would become wanted by attacking your defenses, but since they made it possible to contest from anywhere in the perimeter, workshops are impossible to defend from a higher level player or any team.
---
A dangerous game
---
Yippee... you got paid, with nothing. 
---
The trade menu is a hassle, caps are worthless, don’t trade anything you can’t afford to lose.
---
I don't have the quite the same pressure, but I have enough that sometimes to get the stuff I want, I will pay. Here's hoping you still enjoy the game!
---
I'm currently grinding for perk points on my 1st character, at level 200+ I can grind a level out in about half hour with buffs, just make sure to hit up line in the sand, with 4+ players doing the event I can usually pull 30k xp, providing no one has done the tent glitch.
---
The 3 power up events that pop, they give one of 3 plans
---
Yea same! They don’t seem to badmouth, before I left the vault raid Paige called me an asshole but once I returned to the foundation and spoke to him he seems to just blab about plumbing and not show any kind of resentment towards me. 
---
But I’m curious to see if the dialog of the settlers changes if I were to share it, I mean too late for that character now I guess lol
---
I honestly can't figure out why people are freaking out over this… There's no reason to think this game won't be available for next-gen.
---
There are 3 powering up events: Monogah, Poseidon and the Thunder one
---
Do all three, it will give u these 3
---
Large generator plan, Windmill plan, Fusion generator. Yet its random and u dont know which power up event gives which plan.
---
The scrip limit should be double. And the vendors should have individual caps stashes! 
---
With more caps. Give some love for hording!
---
These changes makes the stash limit acceptable.
---
They always give us the excuse of "server limitations" or "engine limitations" for various features that we all want. What I wonder is how much of the servers resources are being wasted to track every single users 20hr limits, and how much of that can be put towards other things.
---
Nah, I play on ps4 and have a full clan and community I run myself. The currency system could definitely still use tweaks. I just don't think uncapping is the proper idea, but tweak it by all means.
---
Are you on PC, I have a spare pair you can have.
---
maybe he wanted to feel like an actual human haha.  and he could always use a jetpack ( i have a reduced weight ss jetpack that i keep with me). was thinking of trying to switch to no mutations.  might just keep the unarmed damage and intelligence increase.
---
The contesting anywhere is partially my fault as I'd always figure out ways that made it impossible for people to reach the workshop station so I could camp out and protect my investments.
---
They need to be careful, there has been alot of games come out since Wastelanders, but Cyberpunk releasing will basically be a direct clash with the sort gamers involved with 76, mix that with the countless delays leading to relatively lackluster content. If they push any further with the greed than the player count will drop even further than it already has. If anything they need to do the opposite in making more insensitive, a few more new content rewards, less ingame economy (caps, script, PERK CARD PACKS? stupid).
---
My stash on 3 characters is full of 3 star legendary or legacy weapons. I'm going to have to make a 4th or just dump a load of less desirable armour/weapons. 
---
1200 stash and 500 scrip limit would suffice.
---
You should become a happy go lucky, party boy. I'm a professional alcoholic. 
---
Anyway professional drinker stops you from getting addicted.
---
same for me FO 76 dosnt really encourage socialising and the Friendly NPCS are sparce
---
Not everyone is bloodied so adrenal reaction wouldn’t do them much good. 
---
I honestly don’t have marsupial on one of my characters. Sometimes it’s nice to have a character that can only jump like a peasant.
---
I played it last night and it worked just fine
---
If you win, you get banned, but Todd sends you a god roll...
---
of Appalachian kush
---
Hope they implement an option to transfer your character for such situations in the future.
---
In my season 1 experience it is possible to finish w/o a huge grind.  The definition of grind may be different per player but I play daily between 1-3 hours and at level 91, I didn't use any glitches(that I know about). Never once did a NW event the entire run.   Just made sure I had exp booster's and adjusted my "Team" value between building for exp and events when they pop.  
---
Good luck!
---
This is why if a defense event is for more than 1 or 2 waves I'll just leave and let it fail so I can do the 1 wave of the retake event.
---
That said, I've noticed if you make yourself vulnerable by sitting, sleeping in a bed, or interacting with any type of crafting station seems to entice "stuck" enemies to suddenly find you.
---
Thanks guys, I appreciate the feedback! Is anyone here willing to sell the ultracite targeting hud plan?
---
they should make him like psycho mantis.  all crazy mind games and glitches to beat him.
---
A lot of good suggestions here but if you want to do it the 'fun' way go inside Whitespring and pick a fight. Take as many of the endless horde down with you as you can until you finally succumb. Respawn and repeat.
---
Thanks!!
---
Haven't you heard?  Apologists downvote unpopular truth here.
---
For caps ofc.
---
2k is ridiculous. I sell these for 5c in my vendor near the Wayward. Got a vendor just for levels 1-20 and I stick the low level legendaries in there at 1c per level.
---
And you know what makes me play less? Being over the weight limit with legendaries I can't script and are too heavy to put in my maxed out stash box. It's annoying enough how often I can't use my power armour because the weight reduction perks on my normal armour go the way of the dodo once inside and so does my backpack. I've just turned it off sometimes because I don't want to drop the legendaries I earned that day but my script allotment is maxed out.
---
Cheers! This^ my bad
---
Exactly, so they would have to attack your defenses, and become wanted in the process like the criminals they are!
---
 They should've left it that way
---
I can't either. The legendary drops are so terrible that I feel like I need to turn in max scrip on all of my characters to increase my chances of getting something i might use.
---
Were you hyped for the ammo converter?
---
do you still take rads when you collect?
---
I used invincible things like criss crossing floors and stairs!
---
I wish the fist shake emote wasn’t locked to the bundle. I need something stronger than the thumbs down when someone one shots a legendary.
---
I've got one that is TS/FFR/90% and it is really nice from clearing small enemies during a boss fight as long as I run ordinance express/bandolier and I'm using my shotgun or heavy gun. I usually keep between 80 and 100 mini nukes total because I occasionally forget to restock and get down to 20
---
In that case, I'm gonna put a chair or bed at the top of the workshop and use it to see if I can get them to come out.
---
Lol this made me smile.
---
i got a v ss rw mole miner gauntlet for 2k last week
---
Oh you want to jump a tiny ledge, we'll marsupial and strange in numbers has other ideas for you.
---
Click on the card you want to swap out and it'll move to your unused cards. Then click on the one you want to swap in.
---
Wouldn’t that flood the player economy with legendaries, negating the need to craft your own guns and armor since they can’t get the same bonuses?
---
And one of my photo slots is bugged, so the crappy pic I took for a challenge (and deleted) keeps showing up.

I think the big problem for Microsoft is that with the popularity of PC gaming continuing to grow, their hardware is the epitome of redundant for a lot of us. Yeah they're bolstering their ecosystem and Microsoft obviously profits from PC so it makes sense to expand their ecosystem, games, and services to PC. However it makes me ask who the Xbox Series X is for as its touted as the premium model with a cheaper alternative likely launching along side it or not long after, but most people investing in a premium gaming experience will buy a PC, and those that can't afford to will gravitate to the cheaper model. Sure it will maintain it's standard household appeal as consoles do, but for the core gaming audience and enthusiasts Microsoft is bringing nothing to the table other than Game Pass. Sony ultimately won this generation by appealing to core gamers, and recognizing that good games define the consoles and the generations. I have a 4000 dollar PC but I can't play a lot of critically acclaimed games without buying Sony's 300 dollar paperweight. Doesnt matter that those beautiful games will run and look like dog shit to my eyes as the hamster running inside the Playstation get tired and struggles to render it all ,  if ever want to experience a large chunk this generations highest rated games, I have no choice but to pay Sony. And that won't change unless Microsoft invest in releasing an equal number of compelling titles that arent available on Playstation platforms.

It can be found in world but I think it's random so I can't specify a exact point ( I could be wrong tho)

Best way of getting it is with the can do perk

Before It was in the atomic shop I accidentally chained someone with a Tesla rifle while doing Scorched earth. They got mad at me and kept killing me.
---
C'mon Bethesda! Bring back the Mr. Fuzzy and other rides!! I've been playing since Wastelanders was released and it's never been in the shop, yet I've seen plenty of other repeats!
---
Godammit.
---
*I knew*
---
I knew that I'd need to write a paragraph explaining that I mean: A version where only solo players play vs other solo players.
---
100% dmg bonus for a silencer? Is this some kind of bug (wiki says no damage increase) or do you mean because of stealth?
---
Lol, I didn't think of that 😃 I just used concrete and turrets and stuff so they would have to fight their way in.
---

Cyberpunk and fallout are not mutually exclusive, one is an online multiplayer game and one is a single player experience.
---
The water plants usually have 5 or so liberators. I'm thinking specifically of the one where you turn in the water, air, and soil samples for that lady.
---
Have you done the enclave quests
---
stealth armor weighs less, has good damage resist.  great for nuled areas.  only upside to excavator is the extra carry capacity if u have a full set equipped
---
If you knew, then why didn’t you simply say that in the first place. 
---
‘There should be a ‘free-for-all’ option in Nuclear Winter; no teams, last one standing wins’.
---
Don’t expect people to know what you meant when that’s not what you typed.
---
AR serum is good to have on any build honestly.   Why wouldn’t anyone want more dmg the lower ur health is.   Its helps full health builds also when they get hit hard and go low on health.
---
This is my experience.
---
I teamed up and usually communicated for my first forty or so NW lvls.
---
I do consistently better when I don't listen to anyone and queue dolo. Their calls only seem to mess up my game sense.
---
My precious turrets!
---
I wish there was a better way to determine a servers current health or age, like at least to figure out if all the nukes were dropped already. 
---
Has also been quite a while since I've seen anyone nuke anything.
---
I setup shop signs and if they asked nicely they could have some resources I farmed either free or cheaply. Otherwise I told them to server hop if they really wanted the workshop!
---
So? Let them play however they want.
---
I did not used mutations until lvl 200+ because I wasn't interested. And now I only use Eagle eyes and I'm doing fine.
---
Can-do.. 👍 Will do. Cheers
---
Gamer discovers that people play differently, news at 11
---
&gt;Totally understandable, I kinda convinced myself its like a real life survival situation. You wouldn’t carry 100 weapons during the zombie apocalypse why do it during a nuclear one
---
Uhm, have you seen the ferals? It is the zombie apocalypse.
---
This game has so much potential its a shame they waited this long to start fixing stuff
---
I’m doing a bit of a challenge run on one of my characters. No mutations and no legendaries. It’s pretty fun, the game actually feels challenging and I have to consider options and strategy, rather than just blowing through everything. I wouldn’t do it all the time, but it’s a nice change of pace.
---
This is the exact reason why I waste time throwing paint bombs every once in a while. The screams are just me in general.
---
Same I just came across it and thought it would be awesome for my bar
---
Lunchboxes, fireworks, and perk cards are basically trash that clutter the legendary run. There might be nothing less interesting that an exp buff to a level 200.
---
They have the same prefix?
---
The Fertile Soil event
---
Their costume is one of the best in-game in my opinion. I also wonder why Bethesda didn't create any other items around this faction.
---
Probably someone who should be around level 40 , but lunchboxes, x2 xp weekends and team bonuses happened ;)
---
Rewards definitely need to be improved, most of them now are just filler or cosmetics that I personally will never use. All that ghille crap, really? And the thunder pipe gatlin that I wanted is so obnoxiously big that it blocks veiw. Here's hoping we see better loot next lineup.
---
Hell yes, that would be so appreciated...
---
Oh there was a lot of nuking when I was on yesterday. I only wish that people would nuke areas other than the one specific spot where they can attack the Scorchbeast queen without actually going into the nuke zone.
---
I need other types of flux, and that area isn't great for irradiated smelting materials either.
---
Stack some XP boosters and head to wes tek.  That’s should lvl u up pretty quick even at lvl200
---
So many mounted heads. I'm tired of seeing mounted heads. Any cmap that has over 75 plans I assume is full of mounted head plans
---
I'm not sure about the real world equivalent on Sunset but Vim is most definitely Moxie.
---
Some dailies are fun, I like queen of the hunt and that one with the talking animals 
---
Over at the Camden theme park it's easy to do all 3 of those dailies for a chunk of scrip in like 5 minutes
---
dude, the whole game is based on lame and generic quest systems. i bought it still hoping for a true fallout RPG experience, but i found... this thing. I still had a lo of fun por 200 hours, but i got so bored that i can't play it anymore.
---
would think it will be the same game but benefit from the extra power, So faster loading, better fps.
---
personally not concerned since on XB I expect it to just have better performance. 
---
Think our concern should be Bethesda bringing servers up to new gen standards. As in servers must not be the bottleneck.
---
The real winners? People who cheated for their score don’t h e to deal with this crap and got the rewards early on.
---
The daily limit yeah, the 1k max makes sense though I think.
---
Ha! Me too :)
---
How the fuck am I suppose to say this without making post find your home come to your home and scream about it
---
Whatever they do, someone is going to not like it. So basing changes on some player don't like it, isn't going to get your the results you want.
---
But i do agree, the Seasons need to change. I didn't find this a grind, though some days, I just logged in, did the challenges and logged out. That was more because I wasn't really up for playing video games.
---
I did have one day some challenges autocomplete. And missed two days. And I'm still ahead of the score. I only level grinded a little during the double XP weekend. I'm not keen on leveling up so fast. Even though after level 50 it's not much other than gathering perk cards.
---
That said, I'd love to see changes to the season. Somethings I didn't like, like level up every day. Which was what the most grindy aspect to me. Having to use every XP bonus made it easier. 
---
Mainly I just worked in the challenges to whatever me and my friends were doing in game. 
---
The main thing is this. There's no real difference between kill scorch, mutants, or ferals. It's still just kill X amount of creatures. 
---
The challenges come down to the following, eat stuff, kill creatures, kill legendary creatures, build stuff in camp, claim workshops, complete dailies/events. 
---
Which is basically just what the game is about.
---
So they need to really introduce new things to be dailies. The best suggestion, blow up cars. Sadly that's the only really good suggestion I've seen so far. Been looking for others.
---
And instead of repeatable XP bonus, the repeatable could be Kill X amount. 
---
Also, what if the list of dailies included 15 different options, but you only could get points for 5? And they offer different amounts for each. The very easy ones, say, chew gum, gives you 200 SCORE. But what if they had a challenge that was, travel to 4 different locations, in X amount of time, to get 2,000 SCORE? Say you start in Charleston, at the bell. You ding it, and then have to get say, Flatwoods in X amount of time, checkin in with Chloe. Then you are off to Grafton, to say hi to the Mayor, and then you need to go to  Scout Leader Treadly  in the Mire. You can't fast travel at all. 
---
This way, players can take easy options or harder options, as they see fit. If a player choose the easiest ones, they would have to log in every day to complete the legendary. If a player chooses the harder ones, they will be able finish early. They would also be able to skip days and still be able to complete the run.
---
I also think the points labeled Legendary Rewards should be spots where there multiple choices of rewards, and you pick one. And make those rewards things like, weapons, armor, or very valuable camp items (meaning it must have some function that is a boost to the players. Like maybe a bed that well rested gives additional bonus besides 5%xp. Maybe it also gives a 50 to AP and HP. It seems silly to call a reward Legendary if everyone gets the same thing. 
---
These runs should allow for more individualization. For completing them. And they should offer options to complete that can be simple and quick for when a player can't spend a lot of time on a given days. But harder longer challenges for those that want to jump ahead.
---
It’d also be pretty nice if they separate clothing and armor into two categories
---
Got the same Fixer, when firing close range and hitting all the projectiles with sneak crits it drops anything in a matter of seconds. 
---
Not very useful against harder to hit targets or those even slightly out of range like flying SB's etc. though
---
Especially the stash weight cap. Either be like fallout 3 where all you have on you is what you need (and maybe a few nice items for your home you rarely visit) or have a base building survival game. Where we can make more storage and hold more stuff for larger bases.
---
Lol. Same.
---
completely agree; instead they focus on people who hide and don't want to kill 9 creatures or do any nw challenges. it'd be great if they gave some love to nw and fixed some major issues with it.
---
Kinda offtopic but when I started I was hoping mutations would a tiny bit alter my actual look lol. Like glowing or third hand, haha.
---
Realistically, I think they can afford to get rid of all the daily limits, now that they have Seasons. I never logged on every day to get my caps or Scrip or gold, but I make sure to log in every day now for the season.
---
Scrip is worthless to me because the only thing I can do with it is trade 100 Scrip for 40 Scrip or 50 Scrip for 24 Scrip at the Purveyor (the chances of getting a good roll are so low, I'd be better off playing the lottery). Gold is worthless to me because I've already decided not to engage with the Scrip grind, and most of the stuff you can buy with gold is just an entry ticket to a new Scrip grind. Of the few things that aren't, I already have all that I want.
---
Caps are the only currency that has any value to me, but with the speed I can sell things like serums in my vendor, run Manhunt, grind mega sloths, and so on the daily limit was never really a limiter. The vendor caps limit really does nothing but force me to hold on to my excess stimpaks; if I need more caps than 1400, I can get them. Which, I think, is the best argument for the limit's removal - it's useless, anyway, so why bother having it? And additionally not having it will make your game more fun, which, shockingly, leads to greater player engagement and higher player numbers.
---
But I log in every day and I do my dailies, because I want that fireplace secret door. And even if I didn't want what was at the end, it's a fun challenge to get done with my friends. I foresee the Seasons alone motivating me to play this game daily for a long time, even if the daily limits go away.
---
It’s next week. Check the FO76 roadmap. Those that say otherwise are ribbing you.
---
You always get the 10% damage bonus for each addiction, up to 50%. When one of the chems wear off, you suffer addiction penalties. You can offset this by constantly popping those chems (or alcohol, which is an easy one to keep going and fills your thirst meter in lieu of water). You can’t lost the damage bonus unless you use Addictol, which wipes the slate clean. So essentially it’s up to you which chems you choose to get addicted to but regardless you always keep its 10% bonus when using Junkies weapons.
---
I agree. I drink from the toilet IRL, why can't I do it in game?
---
I mean we pretty much had that waiting for Wastelanders. And Wastelanders fixed a lot of stuff, which they subsequently broke with the updates after. I personally would just be happy if each update didn't make things worse and actually fixed what it said it fixed.
---
Seems you got the answer you need here. I'd just like to add you also have a missile silo state holotape that will tell you if and when the silos on the map are ready to launch. ;)
---
I lost over 5000 ammo points by accudentally buying instead of selling ammo. Feelsbadman.jpg
---
Oh ok thank you
---
Who is planning these events and quantities? 200M Cork? The main place for cork is golfballs and at 60/spawn from multiple locations, 200M in 3 days is not possible.
---
It would be nice if the promo planners &amp; designers picked up a controller and played this game once in a while.
---
To add to this, it would be great if it would show the number of different plans, instead of the total number for sale. I'm really tired of travelling to someone selling lots of plans, only to find out that 80% or more of that number consists of *a lot* of the same damn mounted heads.
---
That's what they're doing over /r/AnthemTheGame. It's painful but the people over there have a lot to look forward to while we just have the next horrible patch to prepare for
---
This season has forced me to level up more times than I've liked to admit. All five of my slots are filled but I like playing my new main who is almost 300. There is my rifle character I made when I actually learned how SPECIAL worked (117), my shotgunner(28), my PA heavy gunner(16), and my BETA farmboi(22). 
---
Get rid of daily levels and just keep weekly. I got so far behind at first because I refused to farm XP. Didn't come close to catch up until double dailies. Then I said fuck it and bought like 10 levels to get a bit ahead.
---
ONE prefix is the same.
---
I got the bundle of masks and jumpsuits last month at One Violent Night as an event reward, so I know it’s still possible.
---
This is why we need an item lock system.
---
I really like the way the seasons worked.  It was fun to log on every day and see what challenges I had to do and they only take a few minutes to complete everyday and I get free stuff.  Finished with 5 and a half weeks to spare with no purchasing of any ranks.  I'm not burnt out.  It wasn't a grind.  I'm ready for the second one.  People who feel "burnt out" after the 76 battle pass have never had a difficult grind in their entire life.
---
Make the cosmetics relevant to the season.
---
Reminder time .. I’m level 90 and not done NW or purchased anything
---
I haven't finished the season yet, rank 81 currently.  I think I'm about 7 places ahead of zorbo.  I've missed 2 or 3 days of dailies, one during the double score weekend and been hit by the auto complete bug twice to the tune of about 5000 score. I also haven't bought any ranks using atoms but I may do for the last few levels.
---
It's really not that hard.  I can complete most of the dailies in like 30 minutes.  The level up challenge is the hardest, I know I can level up a fresh character but it's not an option for me as all my alts are heavily laden with legendaries.  That being said, I can still level up my level 260 or my level 160  character fairly quickly using XP buffs and doing line in the sand, radiation rumble, SBQ and West Tek etc... 
---
I've done everything the game has to offer on multiple characters and I never really concentrated on the dailies or weeklies when they offered atoms.  For me, the legendary run has actually given me something else to do and I've honestly enjoyed it and most of the rewards it's given along the way.
---
I think the counter is manually updated
---
Mean someone dropped a nuke from that silo.   Try another silo or hop servers. 
---
If u go to ur holo tapes there should be a missile silo one.  It will tell u if the silos are on cool down or not.   
---
If u don’t have one, I believe u can buy one at the enclave.
---
What do you expect this is a mobile game
---
Where do you go to get these 3 star legdarys ?
---
Especially Vampire Melee build, run it like a bloodied, but use a stimpak once every few days. AR gives a big damage boost to Vampires.
---
Over 200 as well.  the two dailys I do not worry about are NW and level up.  
---
Perhaps the larger on to work towards is the weekly level up 3x for 1k score (or is it 1500?)
---
During the 45 min or so a day I can play during the week, I generally don't get enough XP to gain a level in a single session - it may take 2-3 days.  
---
  Running the whitesprings loop, there's enough XP in one pass through there to get  10k, faster still if you are on a build team with a 4x bonus.  few iterations of that makes getting a level a bit easier.  
---
However, extended sessions on the weekend are another story.
---
  The weekend group I run with has played together for about a year.   We start at a random location - say.. Red Rocket, and as a group, head south, doing events and looting an pillaging everything else along the way.   Over the course of a couple of hours, we'll all level up at least once, and be quite a good chunk of XP towards the next level.
---
Next morning, playing solo for dailys, get enough XP to level up again.
---
Went from level 590-593 yesterday just by playing.  I don't think it's tedious at all.  It's weird to me to see people half my level saying that it takes too long to level up.  But hey, I guess it's all in perspective.
---
Yea i think it is
---
Oh boy text chat incoming in five-ish years
---
Awesome thank you!
---
This seems interesting! I have one character slot free, I'll try this!
---
You answered the question. If OP focused on providing feedback, they would have less time to whine and complain and cite non-existent problems like ‘a Daily Challenge to level up FIVE times’. 
---
Here’s an example, OP:
---
Bethesda reduced our free Atom income by about 75%. So give us back some of the personalization that was lost. 
---
I’d like to see ‘Legendary Tokens’ instead of the Gold, Scrip, Caps, Repair Kits, Scrap Kits, Perk Card Packs, etc.  Then with those tokens, we can buy what we choose out of those and maybe even other options.  Maybe even NW Overseer Points.  A variety to suit different play styles would be greatly appreciated. 
---
Keep the pre-set cosmetics, but make sure they work properly.
---
Bring past rewards back as a ‘alternative’ reward. Example: perhaps Season 1’s Rank 100 reward is now Season 2’s *alternative* Rank 80 reward. You can either choose the old reward or the new one, not both. That way, you are allowing some player flexibility, but still having a reward for full completion each season.
---
Best rifles in the game. 
---
Fixer if u prefer vats.   Handmade if u like to aim urself.
---
It’s Wastelanders content, complete the quest line and it’ll be unlocked (it’s a bullion grind....)
---
You're entitled your opinion. Expressing it in this manner makes you sound like a complete prick though. Based on your critiques I also find it astounding that you would actually enjoy any game. Seems as if you must have likewise hated Fallout 1, Fallout 2, Tyranny, Planescape Torment, Vampires The Masquerade: Bloodlines, etc.
---
Better yet I should be able to see  what's on the market from my camp so I'm not just randomly jumping around the map looking for something I won't find
---
Now we need a legendary enemy here emote.
---
I don't want to be that old guy in the thread.. .. but when I started playing the Elder Scrolls series there weren't even quest markers, you just had to read the in-game material and figure out what you needed to do.  And if you accidentally killed in a central character well there goes your ability to finish the game (might get a warning).  I can't stand this concept that every portion of a game has to be handed to us on a plate with a marker so much so that we don't even have to listen to the dialogue or read the in-game material.  Feel like OP is the poster boy for why this has become a thing in gaming.
---
lol. 
---
lost my flux due to a near invisible mirelurk hatchling in the grass after scorched earth.
---
halfway through the burrows on quest get server shutdown in 5 minutes notice.
---
Run silo like a boss, prep just hangs at 25%. Fast travel out, back in and have to do biometric keycard again. Get into control room and 'server not responding' message. Wait. Get kicked.
---
Switch off and kick my cat. My cat is named Todd.
---
that was all in last few days.
---
No one is forcing you to do it. You don't need the NW challenges to complete the Legendary Run. Some of us actually like NW and welcome a chance to get some SCORE there.
---
All valid points, but you've forgotten about a large portion of people who are still just playing the game and incorporating the score run into their gameplay where it naturally fits. Don't get me wrong - this is not a good iteration of a season pass by any means, but it hasn't changed how I play. Chew bubblegum? Okay, not something I normally do but I have 30 pieces of gum already so that took about 4 seconds to access my inventory. Kill scorched? I do that anyway. Kill legendaries? Bro that's why I'm here. Play NW and do whatever - meh, no thanks. 
---
People have made it out to be much worse than it is (and I can't stress this enough, I think it's *terrible*, but that's mostly because it's replaced daily/weekly atom challenges and I resent it for that alone). I would hope the next season brings with it some positive changes but I am a realist. It will be the same shit with a re-skin and a "pay to be done" mentality that leaves people feeling empty rather than fulfilled. The real issue is that there isn't enough fresh content being offered in the game itself to keep me playing well into another season. They tried breathing life into the game by introducing seasons, but it comes up woefully short.
---
Yup. If there's more than like 5 I can assume the entire store is trash or overpriced and it's always true lol
---
its fucking awful man.
---
put the game down last week after religiously playing daily since wastelanders launch, and i have to say, it feels pretty good. haven't played in over a week and it feels like i stopped working a job. it's sad that the game is so fun, but they just look for ways to gate that and milk it.
---
I found I was better off with no mutations.
---
Level 538 here.
---
radscorpions aren't much better. 
---
I've experienced them being slower than molerats.
---
Five whole paragraphs of complaining and not a single suggestion on how to "change" it to make it better, just another paragraph on what you personally didn't like.  Weird considering your posts title.
---
If you really want things to change tell them what you WOULD like not just I don't like what you've given me.  Make a list of what challenges would engage you or why you think you should be given more atoms and less premade content.  Then make a submission.  They dont read these types of posts where it's just a long rant on how you hate everything and honestly I dont blame them.
---
Getting a full mom quest line would be really great content to consume.
---
Atom shop swag is nice, but perhaps there is a chance one or more mistresses survived the purge and would come back and rebuild?
---
Yeah, I am overly sick of limits and caps being the main retention tool used by so many games these days.
---
If there has to be a cap, it should be high enough that it feels 'good'. The scrip cap in 76 is too low and does not feel 'good'. I am often compelled NOT to continue playing after hitting cap - why? - because now I either have to throw away legendaries or watch as they fill up my precious inventory.
---
Almost all of the motivation to run events or hunt legendary creatures or indeed play at all at deep endgame is to, ta daa, acquire legendary gear - if I can no longer trade it for scrip, I can't use it and I don't have the space to store it - why would I want \*more\* of it?
---
Considering you can hit scrip cap in very short order - this often means I don't play as long or as often as I'd like to because:
---
A: there isn't enough content to keep me interested as deep into endgame as I am.
---
B: I can't just farm endgame currency in any satisfactory manner - nor do I have the inventory to store scrip-able items as I would like.
---
C: I've rebuilt my CAMP enough to be entirely satisfied with how it currently exists so even the biggest draw of the game (to me) is no longer a motivation.
---
D: I've already made and played several alts and all my characters are in this situation.
---
Give me something I can do, that is profitable to my character or provides him or her continual growth, for as long as I wish to do it - and you will see me continue to play for longer periods of time. I feel certain that goes for many folks.
---
How high is your int?
---
I have 24 non-buffed and 31-32 buffed, I find it very easy to get a level up.
---
The defense events always drive me nuts so I usually just wait for it to be time to reclaim the workshop now. It's only one wave and I can (usually) find them all.
---
You mean secondary? Prefix is the one-star slot.
---
And that only once a day...
---
Lol at what PSO does for their market system. It's insane the comparison to this "MMO"
---
Yes he is 16, he should play a game for his age, when he has a problem with it.
---
Sit down and be ready for a shock...
---
Its possible to play the game without Mutations. For god sake you start that way. 
---
Even more shocks - you don't need a Bloodied Fixer to kill stuff, or AA/E Handmade, or a Magic Shotgun. 
---
You don't need to be a Bloodied Commando, or a Full Health Heavy Gunner.
---
Basically people should stop trying to fix what isn't broken. People play their own way. And even here it may simply be a player resetting their mutations of they have a selection they don't like.
---
Hes a L999 Super Mutant Behemoth. But because its Bethesda:
---
1) His model accidentally has a clown costume equipped.
---
2) His character has many elaborate fully voiced taunts, but the only thing he actually ever says is screaming IT JUST WORKS as he swings his dual wield melee mirv fatman launchers at you.
---
3) If one of his attacks connect and you havent purchased anything from the atom shop in the last week, youre temp banned. If you actually manage to kill him, all of your legendary run challenges will autocomplete, for no reward, for the rest of the month.
---
Completed it myself yesterday evening..but when I go to my C.A.M.P to hand up the poster u get at the end it goes all the in my wall..and I do have the glow in the dark wall paper on atm idk if it's that or just another bug...
---
seems you have no idea... guess why they managed it like they did with wastelanders, that only the party leader can progress or everyone have to enter on his own?
---
hasn't updated.
---
I donated 1000 already. Just scrap your bulk to donate.
---
They cycle out content
---
Sony has said most PS4 games will be playable on PS5, so I would not stress too much.
---
As a mostly solo player, I agree. I've become overseer solo and barely ever can make the top ten in a team. But nearly every single time I play solo those last three or four are a well coordinated team that mops the floor with any solo players. For nuclear winter to be successful they need more modes. An every man for himself mode with a smaller map and less players would be a super low hanging fruit that would improve the game greatly. But considering we haven't even gotten a new map yet, I'll be surprised if Nuclear Winter doesn't get abandoned like Survival.
---
I grinded XP hard and logged in every day to do my daily chores. I really wanted the black captain cosmos power armor. I finished rank 100 the other day. I have not logged in since. I have been logging in this game daily for well over a year. One can only take so much of buying 3 rounds of ammo from another player, farming westec to level up, hopping fissure sites to kill legendaries, joining a team to take a photo, and doing the same boring events over and over, day in and day out. I cannot farm legendaries to sell anymore because no one, including me, cares about them except for the untradable ones. But the daily limits on scrip and gold make that a daily chores as well. The game has lost its appeal.
---
Silo's
---
Absolutely, I agree. Without this feature, the game is nearly unplayable
---
Exactly
---
True that its an online multiplayer game, but its core player base comes from those heavily interested in RPGs. Aside from a Starfield release, Fallout 76s largest possible competition to a player base as of yet would from Cyberpunk, due to its huge hype and similar gameplay mechanics. I'm just saying, with its release date lining up around the same time of the beginning of 76s next legendary run. If Bethesda chooses to make it less incentivized, people WILL look for somewhere else to spend their time and there WILL be other intriguing outlets
---
Exactly! I share drink time with my cat everyday.
---
This is the most accurate answer, but I’ve seen some people use that term for all of the legendary effects. That’s why I try to use ‘Primary, Secondary and Tertiary’. 
---
*Mainly so I get to use the word ‘tertiary’.*
---
There are moderators? It's barely a hair from death threats following each patch or other changes.
---
You’ll have to equip another loot bag as your favorite while you’re inside the atomic shop.
---
I think great RPG's will be relegated to single player, so we will have to wait for Fallout Five. Still, there are uncomplicated things that could be done to make 76 a lot more fun.
---
Mods could drastically change this game.
---
I ain't launching at the queen......im launching at atlas.
---
Go to the atom shop and find the bag. Follow the onscreen menu for selection.
---
I believe if you go into the atomic shop and click on it again, select the icons that have crosses over the symbols for loot bag/deathbag?
---
Definitely something to be concerned about.
---
I bought it for caps pre-raid.
---
IIRC, if you wait until post raid, you have to pay in bullion.
---
To be honest, the seasons haven't been that bad. If they just fixed the bugs so they didn't autocomplete and fixed the broken rewards it would be fine. It gives me something to work towards without being utterly obnoxious like the rep grind was. In most cases you can complete the dailies in like 15 minutes tops with a couple that take more work.
---
Maybe give us a new evil boss that climbs the damn with Mad dog Malone. We will call him Grunkus and he will be a massive fat feral ghoul like one of those 500 lb people on TLC. OH! And he’ll throw barrels that we have to jump over and omg I’m talking about Donkey Kong. Fk it, I typed it out, I’m submitting it.
---
Not sure if this is sarcasm.
---
If I wanted the grenades I would have bought the plans. 
---
Why am I getting them when I don't even have the plan for them.
---
Currently on my 16th fucking attempt, wasting 4-5 hours of my god damned life on this shitty quest, literally the only quest I've gone through since returning to FO76 that has bugged or given me issue. Bethesda, REALLY? For fucks sake you can't make the MAIN FUCKING STORYLINE WORK PROPERLY?!?!?!
---
Yeah me niether.  
---
Even though there is a script that disables all mods with a single click i still don't bother with it xD
---
Ayy, instead of trying to attack the guy at Billings Farmstead, i think ill spawn underwater in this sunken boat then just chill for the next 25 minutes.
---
Queen fights , we fight like 5-20 a day on most days
---
I can't even get on a world with my camp the game keeps crashing 😕
---
Thank you, for the information.  I wish I could obtain a mod lie the one listed, but I play on consoles.  :(
---
Saving this for the inevitable later discussions with Obsidian/FNV fanboys. I have the same feelings, but I cannot put them into words as easily.
---
This just debunks the most common apology for TOW - that it's just an AA game with limited bugdet. Well, most of these issues are not matter of resources, they are matter of design. Throwing money and TOW would just produce more of the same, flawed game.
---
A standard non-bloodied heavy weapon/PA build for example has no real use for mutations imho, the minor benefits don't justify 5 perk points for starched genes and class freak. 
---
ymmv, but /u/beefytrout pretty much nailed it :-)
---
Keeps the dupers coming back
---
Yes you can
---
Apparently being productive is overrated. These are good ideas though!
---
tried now, but thats the only lootbagskin I have, only option I get it to equip, and it doesnt work as an unequip like the nw stuff for me, also don't find the standard bag to switch to
---
Not really. They need to reduce the amount of legendaries.
---
That would infuriate me. I know the PC tends to look and play better but being locked out of market by cheaters because of hacks is bullshit.
---
I would like to see this as well
---
hey now i gave 250
---
I started on Zork...
---
It is dark.  your sword has a faint blue glow.  You are about to be eaten by a grue...
---
Updates at reset, go take your grand conspiracies to Qanon or something.
---
Well it lowers your total HP by 50, so if you are a full health build I don’t know why you would want that.
---
Happy cake day!
---
&gt;Pneumatic mod
---
what is that? Something I can buy to craft in my power armor? Or specific kind of PA?
---
If the even did this one thing (only show the number of different plans), that would be quite an improvement.
---
This would be perfect.
---
Of course there moderators. But like I said, they don't really do much.
---
There was a time that the moderators of this forum, were the same as the mods in a fallout forum, where that forum was very toxic towards FO76, because they just hated the idea of a MMO Fallout. 
---
It was pretty clear that those mods were letting haters trash the game. 
---
So yeah, might as well not be any moderators.
---
I do it the same way. Limits and time-gating suddenly stop me from doing what I want so I just stop playing till the next day and sometimes I find other things to do so I take two days.. I just don't play anymore like I used to. Bethesda is slowly losing my attention. I will eventually move on and just forget about this game. I spend more time on here (Reddit) than playing the game nowadays. lol
---
its important to bond with your pets
---
The AWOL armaments event spawns hordes of mr gutsy. Watoga is also a good place to farm.
---
Well, it's a decorative item first, the fuction of it is only secondary and probably just for flavour. Just like the collectron, which also works quite slowly. 
---
I guess the other reason for this is to not be easily singled-out as P2W item. By making the items having negligible gameplay effect, they ensure that people won't buy it for the function and therefore avoid another Atom shop-related outrage.
---
Absolutely. In fact, knowing I was going to start a second character, I was saving the Perk Card, Cap, Gold, and Scrip rewards to cash in for my second character.
---
I'll do the NW challenges only if they make sense in NW or won't affect the game at all for those who actually want to play that. 
---
Take a photo? Sure, I'll do that in the lobby but I'll still play the game as useless as I may be.
---
Build a CAMP? Ok, it's not that big of a deal. 
---
But when they have you killing creatures and hacking terminals I draw the line. That has nothing to do with NW and distracts from those who might actually be there for PVP and not a SCORE challenge.
---
perhaps because response time is slightly longer on trigger pull. the need to charge it may be off putting?
---
extended barrel on it? Shotgun damage mods, demolition perk, and skeetshooter?
---
Maybe change your damage display to numbers and test it to see?
---
I used a BE combat shotgun for a long time. My Gauss is just way better.
---
BUT...in my opinion I did, after many tries roll the best effects for me
---
Instigating, limb damage, agility
---
Do you have mods for your game?
---
How are they supposed to vent their frustrations about the game? find my home, come to my home, and scream about it?
---
Wat
---
There also needs to be a better way to queue up to join friends’ teams who may already be in a match.
---
I got these as a U-Mine-It reward. Isn’t that repeatable?
---
Got a L50 bloodied handmade day before yesterday from Mumbles. It were a good feelin. it almost made up for the hundreds of nocturnal/assassins/exterminators items ive received over the last month.
---
Almost.
---
Is it every PA you have is the same?  Have you tried to destroy your frame and get a new one, which I had to do a long time ago when we had that upgrade that dumped all your PA armor?
---
It just started today, and not automatically update.
---
Explain how you have a Backpack and stealth suit to the class please.
---
For arms, I'd wait until they get around to adding Deep Pockets.
---
On PS4 even when you delete photos in your gallery they remain on your PS4 hard drive and you can access them in the gallery or whatever they call it.
---
CSG for life!
---
Agriculture Centre, Whitesprings (if you aggro them they'll even keep producing more for you), Silos, RobCo, Watoga, Dyer Chemicals. If you only need a few, pop off the Liberators waiting around Vault 76
---
Have you tried turning it off and back on again?
---
I´m not freaking out, would just be too bad if i give my younger brother my ps4 and buy a ps5 and then not being able to play Fo76 for some months if it´s not ready for ps5
---
Agreed.
---
I hope this will be the next update to Nuclear Winter. From a lore perspective (fighting for overseer) it makes more sense and even a gameplay/game mechanic also; you recieve experience/points determined by your placement when you die, rather than receiving XP as a team placement when the game finishes/you decide to exit out. Right now it doesn't create any insentive to help your team get the win but rather that you alone survive as long as possible (why bother being on a team).
---
If I supported my team the entire game, but die a few minutes before the end, then continue to watch them as they get the win, I should receive that XP (as all other battle royales do).
---
I put in 1000 from all my characters yesterday as well
---
I only have 146 in my stash and cant be bothered to hunt more
---
yeah, but want the default
---
I donated all cork I have (1000) just to get rid of it so it doesnt update in real time.
---
Lol your just as wrong assuming I dup my scrap? I can atleast admit I was wrong like I did above and learned something new. Telling from your account and your attitude your just a toxic dick that assumes someone with more than you cheated their way to it, grow up and be less ignorant. 20 dollars for that little scrap? Your playing the game wrong if it's worth that much to you. You shouldnt play games that amp you up so negatively.
---
that sounds like a seriously lethal setup, 2K headshots? wow thats impressive.  that with or without chems?
---
i am also the same way with carry weight. i have strong back maxed out and all my armor pieces are deep pocketed. i have two set of PA and i swear by the Excavator Armor simply cause of the carry weight and extra ore i get. i too had a bloodied death claw and i modded it with the 3rd claw. problem i have with bloodied melee build is having your health slow low and having to get right in the enemies face. but if your good enough then all the power to ya.
---
If you already have them, they're just vendor trash. I've found out through these forums that the quest only procs when you loot one. I've started noting where others are when I see them, then fast travel back and forth turning in one at a time until I get all of them in that area.
---
Spent time yesterday roaming the world for pipe guns, globes, baseballs, golf balls, decanters and I am 30-ish away from being able to make my first donation. I hope this is just a me problem, but this isn’t going well.
---
Blowing up a car too close to a Sentry bot counts as picking a fight.
---
Ahhh I feel your pain. I thought I picked these up randomly looting cuz I'm dumb and don't pay attention - so I thought I should sell them in my vendor for 250 ☹️ ofc they sold immediately and it was weeks before I realized I won't find another pair. I have a second character that is starting the baa baa black sheep missions soon so this time I'll definitely keep them in a display case where they belong.
---
They should maybe limit during week and let us go nuts with gold scrip etc on the weekends totally agree if we have time to earn them we should be able to scrip as many as we want.
---
I use them as fireworks.
---
Just literally did
---
I had to leave the event area yesterday because an enemy had spawned somewhere stupid and got stuck
---
Ok Teach, I stand corrected. But at least I know that comparing different weapons with different effects like you are trying to do is not the smartest thing to do.
---
Can he be like a 90s videogame boss that repeats the same three one-liners over and over?
---
"IT JUST WORKS"
---
"HAHAHAHAH"
---
"SKYRIM!"
---
I’ll give it a try thanks pal!
---
Agree that the format is awful. People don’t want to feel obligated to play every day. Make the challenges weekly or monthly, have a lot more of them, and make them meaningful. Maybe you do need a new character and the challenges are more meaningful/difficult. Maybe each challenge is tied to a specific unlock, but you need all unlocks in a phase to get to the next part of the map. People would still spend atoms to skip past those. To me, that makes a lot more sense.
---
I only keep the PPPie I get from the machines, took forever to get the first one but now I just got my fourth last week. 
---
You can always tell if it's going to give you the pie or not in the first second after pushing the button. The claw moves ever so slightly to the right and then holds a touch longer before dropping...it's that move that lines it up for the pie. 
---
I wish they had kept them in the machines instead of putting them in the world though.
---
There’s always going to be someone in game who will try to ruin your fun, I just kinda go my own way, Pick perks that I find funny or outrageous, I’m finding it very easy to wreck griefers in my T65 power armour &amp; Junkies weapons, Bloodied builds deal a lot of damage but they can’t take it, They can’t really endure but u can with the right chems &amp; armour or power armour, A high fire rate with the vampire effect might help too, I think I’m getting +50 damage buff with junkie weapons, so my mini gun is kicking butt, Just try to have fun &amp; find a fun build that works for you.
---
Does it really matter what you call the effects?
---
This whole thread is evidence that word selection is valuable for successful communication.
---
Lost over 5k points by accidentally buying instead of selling ammo. I hate it.
---
I thought it was from a large inventory but I see it regularly on characters with very little.
---
Eh. What do you expect from Bethesda. Rather than make you feel motivated to come back each day, they'd rather make you feel obligated to do so lest to "miss out" compared to your peers.
---
I remember when I got a two shot Fatman and thought I was about to ascend to god-hood.  Then I found out two shot was really 1.25 shot and the fat man sucked dick....
---
Where are you seeing the counter?
---
I was thinking this bud but after testing it's actually just delayed/displaying what you earned, your not earning it for a second time if that makes sense 💙
---
Settings  
---
Display  
---
Power Armor HUD -&gt; Enabled
---
Yeah, just like when you go to an online book store, it should show you which books you haven't read yet...
---
All of mine are usually above 20 because unyielding. I have herd mentality and Inspirational and play in public teams, usually events for the event xp or building for general int boost. But at level 200+ it get less than half a bar from all my challenges then spend the rest if my time just grinding WS or something
---
My personal favorite part is when you fall through the earth for the third time, hit that pile of rocks and start spinning into oblivion with the ghoul corpse. Good times.
---
Rewards aren't exactly too concerning for me, I just kinda like hard and challenging content. I think a lot of rewards issues would be fixed if they just add in a level cap and increase gear level. Not all that grindy but would be something for players to do
---
I just tried this, the ghouls did not care. 
---
I slept for a while, got my well treated buff, but then got up and went searching for them. I went behind one of the Poseidon cooling towers and found the ghouls just chilling with some scorched in the nuclear steam. They weren't even fighting, just standing there together.
---
That was wave one of four, so I logged out.
---
Ive been building my character around a bloodied death  tambo just because its the only weapon I've found worth anything. Cant get close if they melt me with a gatling. 😟
---
Yes!
---
And little ghoulification for those who have lot of rads!
---
I just want T-65 armor and Gauss Minigun (plus certain mods for each).  With the Gauss mini at Ally I was wondering if I'd hit the gold cap along the way.  Can't find any data on T-65 pricing
---
oh lovely!!  Final Word's little brother.
---
enjoy. see you in Lucky Hole soon
---
This has happened to me too before.  I just have to leave the server and come back which isn't always ideal.
---
Click on the vault tec bag again. There is an option there for "None" or something like that.
---
The sole weapon making more damage than it with a single bullet is the black powder rifle, it's just because Bethesda broke the gun recently. Lever action rifle is now my new main rifle.
---
You can use the simple spiked boark traps to manipulate npc pathing near your camp and in workshops. You just need to bear in mind that the pathing AI in this game is amateurish and barely works at the best of times, so you need to allow a sizeable lane if you want to get them to approach from a certain point or angle relative to your camp. Trying to make complicated tower-defense murder mazes isnt going to work out.
---
If you completely encircle your camp with spiked boards the NPCs will either run to the hills to hide behind trees and never approach, or they will aggro on the spiked board traps and kill the ones in their path, then approach your camp.
---
Yes, but you can't spend it till you complete the Wastelanders quest.
---
Can anyone cite some examples of games that a large community plays *just for fun* with literally no progression and no competition?
---
I mean, the water’s right there right?!
---
So after I switched all my perks around I have 15 agility and I have adrenaline maxed out. So after hitting some enemies I can hit 2k headshots without chems. It’s awesome. But yeah I still use my level 25 excavator with calibrated shocks because I can carry 580 with it and without it I can also carry that much but gotta have ribeye steak give me extra 40 carry weight to get that.
---
My guy thank you
---
if you know were to look, you can get 15-20 at moma dolces.
---
If you are doing the schorchbeast DNA daily, you can pick up a few inside vault-tech U.
---
Well, what do you tell the players that don't agree with this, and want more content during that time?
---
Logged off at the house yesterday and log back in today and it triggered.
---
I will only ever do this challenge at a workshop. Not risking the invisible "can't remove foundation" glitch at my camp. No siree!! But smart idea, esp with a blueprint.
---
Yeah, It's more important to argue semantics than effects and answer OP's question.
---
LOL no wonder you think that scrap is worth 20 dollars. You cant find anything apparently.
---
Don't force your lifestyle on me!
---
What would be really nice is if Zenimax would actually allocate sufficient funds for Bethesda to hire full-time debuggers. It's pretty obvious that FO76 was never deemed to be as important as ESO and therefore never got anywhere near the same kind of support even from the beginning.
---
I'm in the same boat.
---
I'm not against BR modes, honestly, and I'm sure I'd probably enjoy NW if I just... clicked on it but I can't stop playing Adventure yet.
---
It'd probably take only a few minutes to complete the challenges each day in there as well but... I just can't be bothered, lol.
---
Yup. The instant you walk over the bridge into crater it's all whining about screwing them over. The worst part is the ungrateful sods over at Foundation don't say anything about the fact that I have them a share even though they didn't do a damn thing. Splitting the gold story wise is probably the worst option. I only did it because I wanted stuff from both sides and any reduction of rep grind was good.
---
This is where my head is at as well.
---
You should evaluate why you're so reluctant to be corrected when you say something incorrect. Getting angry when you're incorrect is not a great personality trait. As for the "effects to answer OP's question", well Gauss' are explosive by nature so even those secondaries are more apples to apples than you think. Also, someone already explained in another comment that gauss shotguns need to be charged. This is the correct answer.
---
I'm not ginna bother buying the levels until near the end because it takes more every time to reach the next rank so doing the first 20 is way easier than doing the last 20 so I'd rather my score go to the lower level then buy the higher ones if I have to.
---
I missed the first 3 weeks too so I'm trying to do as much as I can except some of the NW ones. I go to NW if it just have to place camps of survive 10 mins or take a photo because those are quick and easy. 
---
But being forced to level up isn't fun so I keep making new characters since the higher your level the harder it gets
---
Bethesda bugs are so bad they can't even be right-side-up on the screen. Probably some object tree parsing error. Awesome.
---
It should default back to the paper bag. That's what happened when I did it after realizing the duffle has a microscopic hitbox.
---
EXACTLY! Mods could definitly make this game more fun. Custom quests etc
---
Dude, i can't help but hate the quests in 76. I had to collect bottles '0'
---
I mean, it's only 5 more levels I'd just get them to 50 if it were me.  They are pretty quick to get at that point still.
---
I'll add you if you don't mind. It'll be me with no 2 at the end. Level 68 I think.
---
Try &amp; save your caps, You’ll find something better, There are legendary spawn spots u can try farming, There’s probably a YouTube video out there with good spots, I recommend doing the wastelander’s quests &amp; unlocking the golf bullion grind if you haven’t yet because there’s some high powered weapons to get.
---
"With this character's death, the thread of prophecy is severed. Restore a saved game to restore the weave of fate, or persist in the doomed world you have created."
---
That was in Morrowind... Unfortunetly I never played daggerfall or arena...
---
That’s how they get you to spend time every day.
---
Make it 500 per day and the limit 10k I feel that’d be much better
---
My bad, I didn’t say it quite right initially. Go back into the Atomic Shop, go to Skins section, and then to the Loot Bag section. Select the VaultTec Duffle bad and press button to equip. It menu will give you the option of selecting None. Do this and your loot bag will default back to the paper bag.
---
Not everyone plays for hours or can even get on long enough every day. Sometimes if I can't get on at the end of the day I get on early just to do it before it refreshes and I normally can't stay on longer than it takes to claim a worshop or do a few events. The days where I play normally I level up no problem but being forced to farm and level up everyday is terrible. That's why I don't even use my main character to do it anymore. Just 10 mins with a new one
---
hmmm whys tha
---
Whelp, TIL that my game is unplayable because I don't use Adrenal Reaction. And here I was having so much fun with the, apparently unplayable, game.
---
I'm actually tempted to get the outfit and wear it with a black prospector's hat and the plague doctor mask. And carry a walking cane...
---
Are the best rifles. 
---
BUT I have sold 3 legendary fixers already. Bloodied, TSE, AA
---
Will prob never part with my 2\* handmade, unless i get a 3\* that has at least same 2 effects. It's the best in my book.
---
For real or joke?
---
on their events webpage - fallout.com
---
how did you do that?
---
It's been mentioned at least 8347636 times on here that the donations are entered manually. Chill. It will become apparent that we are failing this one just like the concrete, they will reduce the amount and pad the numbers so we "complete" it. Hoorah. Good for us.
---
I like doing stupid shit like hunting enemies with a level way higher than mine and I dislike super mutants
---
Almost there! I gave 500!
---
I don't hate BR games.  But if I want a BR, I'll play Fortnite, because NW is shockingly bad in many many ways.
---
I work 50+ hours a week so I understand.  But that is why we can earn them on alts like you are doing if you don't have the time.  Either way it's not like the challenge is unreasonable.
---
Most of these my wife thinks are fun to watch, then it’s always “why are you moving turrets? Are those mines? You used to like this....”
---
Went to the atom shop and unselected the duffle. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
I'll not online right now otherwise I could double-check that, but I'm pretty sure that's all you need to do.
---
It's fairly easy. Just replace the modded ini file with an unmodded ini file. Reverse the process to get back into Adventure. Takes seconds. I only do the NW challenges where it makes sense. I didn't even try the latest lockpick challenge since I don't know the maps well enough to know where to go and I'm about to level up in NW so I didn't want to spoil that if it comes up next. Otherwise, there are some neat rewards (I ended up getting most of the special holiday rewards without really trying), it can be amusing at times, and most of the challenges are easy money.
---
This. Click on it and then select none for which loot bags to replace. It'll go back to the bag.
---
Hey! Join us at [https://discord.gg/PYXVKt](https://discord.gg/PYXVKt), we are one of the biggest communities of FO76 and we range on all 3 platforms (PC/XB/PS).

---
I've used Ghillie on my marine armour and some other parts, purely to stop them showing up in trading (or was it scrapping? I forget) windows.
---
Having to log in everyday made me not want to log in at all.
---
Nice, glad to hear it worked 👍
---
When I have this happen I've found that simply placing my other PA down allows me to exit the one I'm in. The biggest reason I still carry a second set.
---
So I just double checked to be sure. 
---
It gives you +60 Rad res and +60 Eng res still. No downsides. You only gain more armor!
---
Bethesda: You had me at "zero content". Consider it done.
---
&gt;I do it the same way. Limits and time-gating suddenly stop me from doing what I want so I just stop playing till the next day and sometimes I find other things to do so I take two days.. I just don't play anymore like I used to. Bethesda is slowly losing my attention. I will eventually move on and just forget about this game. I spend more time on here (Reddit) than playing the game nowadays. lol
---
I posted this on this thread but for some reason, it jumped to another thread?
---
The problem is that I usually spend more time geinding xp than actually playing and enjoying the game when I can get on now. Just not as fun anymore and I'm only doing that for the score. 
---
If i had to level up every other day or so, like the 3 times per week one, then every other day I could probably play more and enjoy it more and not grind so much everyday instead
---
it just works ™️
---
It’s a terrible idea.
---
Using consumables to help your xp gain and other buffs might help you get there faster.  Like I said I guess it's all in perspective I guess.
---
Also please drop mole rats.
---
Also the concrete was over the online Quackcon. So chances are they weren’t updating.
---
An online con takes a lot of work and something’s get lower priority.
---
I'm getting my alt to 50 so that I get the best possible rolls. Sure, some things have 45 cap, but most cap at 50 so why wouldn't you just go up to 50 to avoid getting lvl 45 stuff that *could have been* lvl 50?
---
Shh. They're sleeping.
---
The Agricultural center near Flatwoods.
---
3000 is a lot for a non legendary fixer

You can get 1400 gold per week max from treasury notes and 300(?) from the dude at the Wayward, i.e. 1700 per week. T-65 without mods is 5650 gold. Gauss minigun with a barrel and capacitor is another 1000 gold or thereabouts. So that's about 4 weeks worth of grinding at least. Add in 750 for calibrated shocks and 2000 for the jet pack or 750 for Emergency Protocols, and you're looking for a gold grind that's already shaping up to be at least as long as the four or five weeks of rep grinding you'll have to do anyway.
---
I personally find things like the chemist backpack mod and the ammo appliance from the raiders too damn useful to ignore, but YMMV since the appliance doesn't produce 2mm EC and the backpack doesn't work with PA.
---
 I do it the same way. Limits and time-gating suddenly stop me from doing what I want so I just stop playing till the next day and sometimes I find other things to do so I take two days.. I just don't play anymore like I used to. Bethesda is slowly losing my attention. I will eventually move on and just forget about this game. I spend more time on here (Reddit) than playing the game nowadays. lol
---
Modding a sub is no easy task and for them to go through and remove duplicate,already been posted threads would make it a no free time,full time job.
---
I'm more than sure they do what they can, but they can't spend every waking moment skimming through every post and *Every Single Comment* it would make an already stressful, unpaid bit even worse.
---
Get the password, its in the further side of Poseidon that you dont have to enter when doing the power up event. Never have to hack the terminal again.
---
“Hey, new guy! Take this fucking rolling pin that does extra damage at night and be fuckin grateful.”
---
Its objectively better than either of those tbh.
---
If you're on Xbox I'll gladly buy it from you, been looking for one for a while.
---
What platform are you on? Someone with the plan could make you one assuming you dont want a legendary
---
Lol
---
Thanks!! Im stupid
---
I do that too. Before I start the dailys on my main character I eat canned meat stew for 12% (healing factor), sleep for the 5% for 3 hours and path to enlightenment whenever I can. Still doesn't get me a whole level so every other day my main character level ups and I don't have to bother with another new character that day
---
I’ve said it before I’ll say it again.
---
Let us EARN as much scrip/bullion as we want.
---
Limit the spending.
---
I've been thinking about the state of the game as compared to WoW; If they decided to change it up, have factions = group roles: BoS = tank, Enclave/SS = stealth DPS, Raiders = melee DPS, and Settlers = support.  there's more to it, of course, but that's an idea in a nutshell.
---
True, point taken, keen of the moment, I wanted to spend the scrips like now (45) lol
---
individual rewards
---
None of it is confirmed yet but that's what we "know" so far. I believe you get one every 50 levels so yes, you'd unlock 2 slots. I also believe they said you'd get 1 card free.
---
Joke
---
We've had a doozy of a day officer. There we were mindin our own business. Makin some improvements to our new C.A.M.P. When all the sudden these Santas start killin themselves all over my property. Now, I don't know about how much experience you've had with this kind of thing but me and Beckett here, well, we ain't had any
---
for me its just filled with treasure hunter outfits
---
Wait for 50 or any potential level 50 weapons will drop at 40 instead
---
Defending workshops COULD be a lot of fun, if the enemy would actually attack the workshop. 
---
As it is, they often like to choose a random object, destructible or not, and attack it endlessly. They don't even start by going after important things. It just seems random.
---
Most recently I went stealth and watched ghouls just attacking a chain-link fence for five minutes. The fence can't be broken, and they could have just gone around by stepping 5 feet to one side. I finally put them out of their misery.
---
When I first started playing, I would go all out and build super elaborate defenses and structures, repairing every workshop turret, blocking every entrance. There was no point to any of that since they can spawn inside locked buildings, or spawn so far away and stay away, that you can't get them without abandoning the event.
---
I know! It's tempting, but you're so close, just eat some stew, get all the XP buffs you can, and go out questing and killing. You'll be 50 in no time.
---
ouch
---
If I had to run lucky hole even 1 time without coming out with lead.......
---
my head would explode.
---
Props for your perseverance.
---
Agreed, mole rats should never be the attacking enemy.
---
This would t encourage more duping? Not like Beth Cares much at all from what I see around the sub
---
I have a spare level 40 on xbox
---
It is. I never said it wasn’t. I also know they are doing this as a volunteer. But by volunteering it kind of means they are into spending their time moderating.
---
And to a lot of people they could do better.
---
They're meant to be a way to passively farm for resources while you do other things. But since it's now the only way to force people into PVP the griefers will constantly kill players they find in a workshop. Which means, unless you want to experience really unbalanced, one-sided PVP, avoid them. Grab one for a challenge then abandon it.
---
Besides, once you pass 50 there are much better ways to farm for the majority of resources so you don't waste materials building up a workshop just to lose it.
---
yeah I got it, had to click lol, was so focused on the keyboard info
---
Ooh shit, OP edited the post just to lolololol at you 😬
---
&gt;And you know what makes me play less? Being over the weight limit with legendaries I can't script and are too heavy to put in my maxed out stash box.
---
So drop them and move on. It is what I do all the time.
---
i only do the easy ones. Take a photo in nw, place camp down. Fk the ones that say kill players or use stimpaks ect.
---
also paying a bit more to get whatever you want (heavy armor, shotgun, melee, etc.) is a must.
---
Which means his post was bogus.
---
😆 glad you got it sorted out
---
Again I'm sure they do what they can when they aren't involved in handling real life issues.
---
Is the run for account or each character separate?
---
2 shot Fatman is the only usable Fatman imo. same for Auto Grenade launcher.
---
https://youtu.be/aXxi0CxTYdc

made a little video about the build i came up with
---
videoquality is trash but the build was surprisingly effective :D
---
And I say, I don't think they are. I get your opinion, I respected it.
---
Seems you have no idea... it's absurd to think that unique dialogue can only be available in an instanced location. Russel Dorsey himself has different dialogue depending on whether you sided with crater or foundation. You clearly haven't even taken a single second to think about what it would mean if the game worked like you think it does. Member near the beginning of the game, that part when you go get a deathclaw egg for some dude in a amusement park? He's not in a instance. If we follow your logic, then it should be impossible to hand the egg over to him, since his dialogue can't change based on what the player has done.
---
I think everyone has a suspicion the rng is weighted towards junk items and effects, but every time it is brought up people cry confirmation bias and people start posting how they just got a bloody explosive fixer, that type of thing. Then someone actually digs into it and finds out in one instance they are bugged, or rigged, however you want to look at it. I honestly don't know if there is a way to check into other items, I'm just surprised some die hard isn't tracking drops and posting results. That would be a project that I'd like to see.
---
There’s sometimes a legendary robobrain at Berkeley mine exhibit workshop, It’s a quick workshop to claim for a challenge &amp; possibly get a legendary. Apart from that, I don’t bother with claiming workshops unless a low level player is trying to get plans &amp; needs help fighting of griefers.
---
At early levels it’s a great way to get plans and resources.
---
They said they'll have a pause between seasons, we don't know really much else about when the next one will start
---
I agree. Pre-Wastelanders there wasn't much new things to do but I still played a solid session each day and that was enough - now there rolling content through to maintain and increase player population but the sad thing is this method is a double-edge sword: Bring new content out and diminish the quality of the game.
---
And I too respect yours.
---
This Moose approves.
---
I would have been more incentived if we could get atomic onslaught paints for armor pieces. I dont like the confetti suits. Atomic Onslaught looks cooler. Just wish it was on the secret service pieces and/or the combat pieces for us non-pa users
---
I had this issue a few months after the game came out, I couldn't get out of my power armour and it removed all the buffs from it too, I gave up after about a week of that happening and haven't touched the game since
---
I don’t understand what this grind business about lol claiming a base is a grind?  You just fast travel and claim it
---
Killing legendary a grind too? When you playing aren’t you doing events? So what grind 
---
Buying stuff from player? 
---
I clear my dailies in 30min to an hour of my regular 3hour play session.

I’ll tel you what a grind tho the gold bullion/ treasury note bullshit

Really!?!? I'm on now... name is seven Gun quota

I got a few weeks late start and now im grinding super hard, seems impossible.

The Mountain Scout Mask.

Doesn't clip with anything 😉

Working right now I'm afraid. I'll be on in maybe 3 hours.

I'm in the same boat.  I finished the run a few days ago, and now...
---
I've been logging in each morning to work down my backlog of scrippable legends and treasury notes, but I haven't actually been  doing a lot of *playing*.

What platform?  If PS4 I will give you the plan. Then you can build your own   Unless you know the plans they won’t drop from the purveyor

It shows a bunch of mods for pistols and other gyms that are in the files but not in the actual game. Real shame...

&gt;The perk packs will have value when the legendary perks become available.

I heard rumors they are changing that for no good reason. I heard they mentioned it would no longer give the bonus points. Cuz "feedback"
---
Quest items cannot be removed from your inventory, however, quest items ALSO ignore their weight as long as they're marked that way. This has been true in Bethesda's games for forever (Elder Scrolls and Fallout alike), and remains so in 76. If an item can be stashed, it's no longer flagged as such, so keep that in mind.
---
Ultimate role play by bethesda... your body has fused to it haha
---
I'd rather give mine to low level players
---
I'm pretty daft. How does super duper yield more resources? I thought it was only good for crafting things to get double?
---
IDGAF.. Im not the one getting dunked on up in here...
---
If you dont like the event don't do and if it pleases you be vocal but please don't try to shame people who participated.  You're just being a bully then.
---
Ya know what I'd like? If the "defend" event didn't start approximately 15 god damned seconds after I take the workshop. Why don't they want to encourage us to build elaborate, cool defenses? I barely have enough time to slap down my blueprinted turret platform, build a generator, and wire the two together before I'm set upon by ghouls or mole rats.
---
I'm sorry...what? this drama has already been settled privately. Sac has a way of stirring up old shit. I don't want it discussed anymore. I am grateful for what Rage and the Discord did for me. I'm just saying this issue has been resolved.
---
I got that bundle just for outfit and statue and I don't regret it, it looks really cool! I think I'll steal your idea, I got plague doctor mask too, now only need a hat xD
---
Bethesda has always sucked at npcs
---
end game? well I launched my first nuke and everything if that's what you're saying
---
That's what my account has personally experienced.
---
Same with bots on parade', am exercise in patience. I only do it for the score bc it's fairly quick and I can use my side arm but it could be fun if they tweaked it.
---
Acquire a [missile silo holotape](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Missile_silo_state_holotape) and look at the status of the various silos to see when they're ready again
---
Right. Pll that didn't get the rewards from last year in NW, whoops there's a bug for a few weeks. Not enough gold. Oh no you can go back inside the wayward and get as much as you want for a few days. Can't get that handmade. Dup glitch for a week or so, and 3 ppl get their alt accounts ban and 50 ppl get suspended for 5 days. If you don't get the board game completed I'm sure there's gunna be another whoops with the rewards accidentally given away. Not enough concrete for atlas, well just lower the amount the day before and magically the amount given will quadruple, in a day. Over 5000 hours of game play, and still play, but I see it.
---
Account wide. However, certain rewards go to whichever character cashed it in. Caps, Scrip, Perk Cards, Gold, Repair Kits, Scrap Boxes, Lunchboxes, Fireworks, etc. CAMP items, Skins, etc go to all characters.
---
So you unlock rewards with one character, save the stuff you don't need (Caps, Perk Cards) and then cash those rewards in when you're playing on your other character.
---
It has been a couple days, so I don't know if you got your answer, but in Adventure mode you get it from the Settler faction vendor once you hit h
---
max rank and get the gold bullion required to purchase the plan. 
---
In nuclear winter, it is randomized from the loot source but generally found in the best chests due to its rarity.
---
They fixed a dialog bug so you now always have to talk to him twice - once to get the quest and once to hand it in. But you still don't actually need to do the quest if you have one of the items that previously allowed you to immediately hand it in.
---
I think he meant scrapper
---
Workshops have their own materials to build with. If you are using  workshops materials, it's highlighted in green. It will turn white once you start using your own.
---
Workshops are a great way of completing "Build X amount of items in camp" challenges, without having to clutter your own camp, or use your own materials. 
---
You can farm different mats from different workshops. Power plants for example will let you make fusion cores providing the plant has power, (Powering up event) or you attach a fusion generator. 
---
PvP is also available in workshops if the one you own is contested and you are in the area. It will warn you that you can be killed by other players when claiming. So if you get ganked, don't be surprised. It happens.
---
i mean, it’s a rain collector. it’s not gonna be purified and how often do you see rain in appalachia?
---
I've never had any spawns under the plant itself, what I've seen the spawns do is often they're at the cooling towers messing around with the ghouls that normaly spawn over there. At other times they also seem to like to spawn inside the small white building that's the furthest away from the main workbench just to destroy the furniture in it.
---
I dream of a full lugged 44 barrel!
---
Sounds good thanks.
---
Looks like Bethesda hasn’t manually changed the total cork donations yet, and the event started automatically. Most like they are going to change the require donation total once they edit our current amount of donations
---
I always assumed they were just watching me because they were worried I was going to rob or murder them.  And they would be right given half the chance.
---
I wear a cowboy hat with my plaque doctor mask and it looks good to me.
---
Check the Whitesprings housing. That's where I found mine.
---
"enhanced speed of collection by perks scrapper and also super duper"
---
I actually found a couple good applications for it. One was for the old kill ants challenges. You know that darn deathclaw at the power station near Watoga that would kill the ants just before you got there? Just lob a mini-nuke from a distance and tag everything at the station. Also, now I usually start Distant Thunder by lobbing either a mini-nuke or orbital strike beacon into the middle of the fracas.
---
So then players can’t criticize them for being lazy and added a carry perk legendary perk? 😂
---
If they'd just do away with all of the capped amounts in general, I feel like I'd be more willing to play it. I haven't played since a couple weeks or so after the Legendary Run launched because I just couldn't force myself to endure the grind any longer. It's a futile endeavor.
---
My problem is that like many others, between working full-time and spending time with my family, I don't get to play video games very often. So when I do, I want to hop on and have a good time--not waste the time I have grinding for things. But for those who do endure the grind, they're met with ridiculously low caps for what they've been working toward. 30k caps? 150 maximum scrip per day? A surprisingly low cap for Legendary Run exp (repeatable exp. challenge is a joke if you're a high level player)? You shouldn't force your players to play the game every single day in order to get the maximum value from their game time.
---
It's frustrating. It's the kind of thing that turns loyal players away from a game franchise after so long.
---
It gives you a notif when you take the workshop that you're opening yourself up to PvP, so no, it's not "forcing" people into PvP. If they click "claim", then they've entered the PvP zone.
---
No.
---
Look I'm all for making pistols a little more relevant but some of these suggestions don't make much sense to me personally.
---
Tank Killer for pistols? Really?
---
What about pistols carving out their own niche that makes sense for their pros and cons, like:
---
* Improved movement speed and agility while using pistols vs other bulkier weapons (innate, not based on perk cards)
---
* Lower sprint AP cost because you're running with a lighter weapon
---
* Lowest AP cost out of all weapons, which is tempered somewhat due to the need to reload more often than other weapons.
---
* Better stealth due to being lower profile and likely to make less noise 
---
* Best in class hip fire accuracy
---
* Dual wielding at the cost of some accuracy and more reload speed
---
* Maybe a percentage chance to disarm enemies, playing off the old western trope of shooting a weapon out of someone's hand
---
Fan the hammer is a popular one but how would it be implemented? I would figure that you would have to have a separate option to enable it like it replaces the bash animation.
---
Whatever the case, on the whole while I'd like to see pistols be end game viable, I at the same time don't want to see them be equivalent in effectiveness to top tier rifles or heavy weapons. Pistols are inherently weaker weapons by design
---
If this game survives another year or two, eventually they will have to right?
---
Heck, I'd craft you a non-legendary max level for free with all the bells and whistles.
---
Because scrap is piss easy to get and if you struggle to get scrap then your just bad at the game.
---
A man can dream.. The worst thing is that they keep showing the bull barrel in pictures for atom shop skins implying it is in the game even though it isn’t. Just goes to show how unaware the developers are
---
How many weeks are even left in the season? I feel like some people kinda did this to themselves (the burnout). I’m taking my time with it.
---
Idk, some random throwing a fit cause you’re playing the game... sounds like you should be pretty offended
---
I would be fine with finding cool exotic grenades if they didn't have a explosive range of 8 inches
---
I had this problem a while ago up to 'server not responding' every other attempt at crafting. In my case it was a bugged .ini file, I moved all of them (in the install directory and the documents/My Games/FO76 folder) to a backup folder and let the game create them again, added the one ini fix I use again and had no troubles anymore. Maybe worth a try for you too if you are on PC.
---
Ooo.... you got me. The shame!
---
You self create these problems and then blame the game for them. Why?
---
"What? Do you guys not like ghillie?"
---
My issue is we are already getting updates at such a slow pace that it makes it appear they are busy fixing things. But they aren't. Either give us these slow once-every-6-weeks updates with a priority on fixing things, or let's have more frequent updates and have them be as unsubstantial as what we've been getting. If they are unable to do any more than that, they clearly need to do some moving around, although we already kind of know that. People have been saying it for almost two years now, but they need more people working on the actual game and not on recoloring fallout 4 assets
---
Too soon
---
I put them in my vendor for a couple hundred caps as I level up my alt since they can't be scrapped. You can have one for free, but I won't be online for about 8 hours 😒
---
Yep. Wastelanders broke VATs. I can only shoot half or less of a magazine before it forces me to reload. The respawn bug is still a thing. So many of these "little" things add up and make for really janky gameplay.
---
I wish the ennemies would stop going after every little piece of pre-built thing that can be destroyed. It's that bad that I often go around the workshops I own just to remove everything that can be removed just so the ennemies have nothing to distract them from coming at me.
---
Sorry little redditards don't get to decide such things. Do yourself a favor and get some sleep, your wife's boyfriend gave you a bedtime and he wouldn't like that you're staying up past it. All rage did was use her issue for personal gain. Her channel was abandoned over this bs, and has hopped over to mine. If you feel like getting your ass clapped add ign Nekrosias and come swing by, have some fun while I remind you your family tree looks like a Christmas Wreath 🌲
---
Do you have a skin applied to them?
---
Also, I'm nearly sure the likes of SS armour can't be sold
---
Must not be on a server with me. I regularly power up the plants and have twice powered Blair, although I didnt find that worthwhile.
---
&gt;So when I do, I want to hop on and have a good time--not waste the time I have grinding for things. But for those who do endure the grind, they're met with ridiculously low caps for what they've been working toward. 
---
Make up your mind do you have a lot of time or do you not? Because these low caps actually work in favor of people who don't have a lot of time to play the game.
---
The inventory cap currently is fine. Learn to use it
---
Have you seen the amount of crap they have to wade through? A better post would be: "FO76 Subscribers, please make this forum better". Starting with an end to pointless, repeatedly asked questions that could easily be answered if people bothered to take 30 seconds to actually read.
---
I have a tip: Do not defend - wait and recapture. You will get a lot more xp and the recapture is very fast because it has no waves. Sometimes i had to kill just one enemy and it was done.
---
There should be a Legendary Run queue for people who are only there to complete challenges lol
---
You chose the wrong game to get bent out of shape over pvp...
---
why ?
---
I dont live my life according to other peoples opinions.. anyone who does is a fool IMO
---
Oh thanks for the tip!
---
I would like to add to the single action revolver that they need to reduce or “fix” its recoil. When you shoot the thing it goes violently down and up (yes, down and up). Its a whole new level of recoil compared to the radium rifle lol
---
That's sac the boy from discord, as usual being a douchy little 16 year old, I'm foreign so I don't expect him to know better, especially in his cousin fucking country
---
So how are people building these huge camps with several floors of stuff, dozens of display cases, four or five vendors, scrap robots, signs, decorations, six or so industrial water purifiers, and I can only build a small two story house, three display cases, a Red Rocket garage, one vendor, no robot, one water purifier and I'm a sliver under the build limit?
---
This is why I almost never take Gorge Junkyard. There's always a damn mole rat hiding in the back of a container somewhere chewing too damn quietly.
---
Ah! The skin! Thx so much
---
The only problem is that their fixes would break twice as much stuff
---
Her channels dead dude, that was the last video posted. Do report tho,
---
Agreed
---
I would buy this in a heart beat. 10mm pistols are underated and this is perfect for leveling with.
---
Why? Well because: 
---
- Bloodied 
---
- Level 5
---
- 10mm Ammo everywhere 
---
- Many mods especially Suppressor and Auto
---
- Perks for pistols 
---
- Fallout 4
---
Ps4
---
Moving offensive perk to perception gonna break pipe revolver and pip-bolt action rifle, i have an bloodied/vats commando/gunslinger build and i need 15 AGI/LCK to run it. [My explosive gunslinger build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3c138fe&amp;d=s01sb0pk2pl2pd2pp2eu0ib4ir2a00an2ao0ak2a30ad2al2lt2lu2l12la2l71&amp;w=&amp;n=pistolero/explo&amp;m=)
---
I just think they need to change some thing like the Tommy gun and 10mm SMG work with guerrilla perk, dmg and AP cost, more gun and mod ? like you said and a dual wield... Same for one handed melee, that could be really great.
---
Lol just a joke. Wasn’t serious
---
How are they making me feel like I am missing out anything? I'm constantly down voted for pointing out that I drop excess legendary items all the time because I simply don't give a shit about hording them for script. Given script rains down like water just from playing.
---
It does work, you have to click the zipper.
---
I’ll try that tomorrow and update you. That’s actually a really possible cause and if so, perhaps Bethesda needs to hire you lol
---
Check the server for ammo machine dupers before you even attempt it , everyone screams 12 ammo machine blueprints in a personal camp is  “ completely harmless “ but that isn’t true at all and the servers are crashing like crazy because people are trash
---
I dunno about a perk card.. but there should be slugs
---
Found one.
---
See, here's the thing, while we do click agree when claiming a workshop, the vast majority of players have no interest in PVP. And since Bethesda has, thankfully, removed most of the other methods of killing players or forcing them into PVP workshops are all griefers have left to harass other players that want nothing to do with them.
---
Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.
---
You can switch the hud on and off in the settings. It sounds like it may have been switched off for you.
---
I just want to aim down the sights on my bow :/
---
It's half my supply and I've been playing nonstop since Wastelanders. It's about as rare as ball fibe for me
---
i love how they think we wont play if they did this yet i stopped playing because of the limits. weird...
---
I do definitely see your point. It’s sad that it seems to work though, hey?
---
Just let me scrap the SS armor and bullion weapons for gods sake. When you craft 10 pieces then wind up with 10 garbage legendaries as a result and there's not enough daily script... can't vendor em! Gotta destroy them or make room to store them until tomorrow...
---
Thank you that helped immensely!
---
Have you bought all the other plans in game? Heading to the whitespring vendors can get rid of a few. Camp hoping is good as well, though finding something worth buying is rare. But you can always buy ammo
---
Concrete was only updated on days 1 and 3. It went from 4.6 to 12 because that was 2 days of donating
---
This is another reason I have mules. But yeah, it's janky gameplay.
---
&gt;If there has to be a cap, it should be high enough that it feels 'good'. The scrip cap in 76 is too low and does not feel 'good'. I am often compelled NOT to continue playing after hitting cap
---
Good then it means you don't have to put hours into the game if you don't want to.
---
&gt;  Almost all of the motivation to run events or hunt legendary creatures  or indeed play at all at deep endgame is to, ta daa, acquire legendary  gea 
---
So drop it and keep playing until you get a better drop.
---
Lololol you couldn't even complete the concrete challenge without Bethesdas help, so you must of went somewhere wrong 'master scrapper' best at this game
---
I had insomnia the night before so I played from 4AM to 6AM and did some ammo/inventory crap.  Logged out normally and didn’t log back on until lunchtime.
---
sshhhh!
---
Expressing it pretty thoroughly?
---
I don't understand how critiquing a game makes me sound like a prick. 
---
I essentially just wrote a review.
---
We're planning on doing this actually! :) I don't have an ETA yet but it's coming. :)
---
Quite a few challenges are glitched. Try on a different character seems to be the only fix
---
I'm saying I typically don't have a ton of time to play the game, but when I *do* have a good few hours to play, I get hit with the caps and it's frustrating. It feels like I always have to play catch-up with the game since I haven't played in a while, but then there's only so much I can actually accomplish in a few hours due to the caps.
---
Yea I am for sure 
---
I have a str/int/agi/luck character and I wanna switch between heavy gun and melee build as well as crafting build

I would really appreciate seeing serum recipes in people's vendors. I have only ever found one - Healing Factor, I don't remember how much I paid, several thousand I'm sure, but I was glad to buy it. I am level 190ish, but have delayed endgame for reasons, and I don't have access to wherever you buy serum recipes from.
---
Yes, that's literally my point. There's a lot of crap on here. And they volunteered to help moderate the forum. And it just doesn't feel like they are even trying.
---
It's already at  5 fps...
---
Did you learn the mod by scrapping or buying the plan? They exist. https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ultra-light_build
---
I was so hyped for gauss shotgun. I got exalted settlers changed my junkies heavy to junkies shotgun and run to Line in sands just to realize I cannot oneshot a lvl 40 scorched with it.
---
If you charge and vats it its cool. Besides that its not even strong (imo).
---
Combat shotgun shots faster, reload faster, have better mods and silencer.
---
Still PA in vats no good.
---
So I went back my fav j/e gatling it still rocks :D
---
Aye thanks for mentioning this game. I checked out that subreddit and it looks pretty badass I may try it out soon!
---
&gt;  And additionally not having it will make your game more fun, which,  shockingly, leads to greater player engagement and higher player  numbers. 
---
And people getting bored and fucking off. Or standing around bitching about how they burnt though new content in a week and demanding new content to keep them occupied and complaining about how bad the developer is because they can't create new content on a weekly basis.
---
The only NW daily I did was a couple days ago, Use Photomode in NW.  Loaded into NW took a picture in the lobby logged right back out.
---
Scorchbeast Queen spawns there.
---
For what it's worth. Cork is a seldom used resource. More so, there's unlimited amounts of it in the game. In fact, there's unlimited of everything. Because that's how all MMO are. Resources keep respawning. So contributing doesn't rob players of anything.
---
More so, while the event is open to everyone, it might not be for everyone. For lower level players, it can encourage wider exploration of the world, for the resources. In return they get stuff they may need. Especially on the plans. 
---
Which seems the biggest issue with higher level players have the biggest issues with. They don't get rewards of value to them. Well, maybe the event wasn't designed with them FIRST. Yes, I said what you aren't supposed to say. Not everything has to be designed with the high level players first.
---
This event comes right after a new influx of players. An event that helps them feel they are part of the world, and give them plans they might not get for a while, is a good thing. Yeah I know some are going to disagree with that.
---
But doing an event after a new influx of players is a good idea. And as a higher level player playing from launch, I don't mind giving cork. Or anything else. 
---
See, it's called a community event. And as such, sometimes doing a community event means helping even if you aren't getting the best benefits from it. And in this case what harm is it contributing? Spending some time collecting resources and donating? None.
---
So those that are all upset over the rewards for this event, don't seem to understand what a community event is about.
---
Agree. As much as ppl on here say they’d be fine with it, all it takes is looking at steam analytics to tell that this game is dependent on each update. Wastelanders gave them 4x their player count for a couple months. For now they can only afford to go all in debugging or new content.
---
Final original quest and toughest enemy in game.
---
Without putting spoilers, they're spawning a creature that, potentially, drops good loot. You'll learn all about it as you progress through the story.
---
We already have it on pc with the mod.
---
Some people are never satisfied I guess?
---
I don't mind the ghillie suit but it looks a bit weird in this game, not like a proper ghillie. It's more like a green wookie outfit
---
Nope. 
---
I’ve checked all the learned ones. And looked through all plans from reg. 
---
The only mod I have bought is for the under armor
---
Could probably just stay on one server. The machines there produce more low lvl Haney’s indefinitely
---
I have all the resort plans, but not all the various mods for weapons I don’t use at all. Could be a good way to occupy some caps though. 
---
Creative mode in Minecraft jumped straight to mind.
---
But, the issue here isn't that people want no progression or competition quite the opposite, it's the pacing that's the problem.  When you can only attain a meager amount of progress, which has to be done daily to get anywhere, most people feel what little progress is made isn't even worth considering as progress, therefore you get stuck in a rut of 'what am I actually achieving here?'
---
Ammo machine blueprints are the issue , if you find a server full of those morons just server hop. Eventually Bethesda will pretend they care and ban them for like 5 hours making everyone rebuild but not deleting the actual blueprints so it will just happen again and again
---
Buy any recipes you don't know.  This will probably take a long time and a lot more caps than you have, but it's a goal.
---
Make sure you have the best gear, you can get close with caps, but if you're going for that bleeding edge, you may have to gather/find a few god-roll items to trade for them.
---
Stop farming, and buy all your ammo/crafting mats.
---
Get a second account, and load all 5 characters there with 30K caps each.  Then realize you can use THOSE to transfer 30K to each of the 4 other slots on your main account.
---
Level up all the lowbies you loaded with 30K caps.  See how close you can keep them to 30K until they get past 100.
---
Level up a lowbie to be a mule, and have 15 str and as many item weight reduction perks/armor and dump all the junk and other legendaries you can't scrip or are worth too much to scrip (but that you don't have the cap space to sell).
---
When you get to about the 3rd mule you're trying to level up, take a step back and re-analyze your life choices.  Maybe go outside and re-familiarize yourself with the sun and other humans.
---
I'm not quite through this list, but I'm getting there...
---
Yeah.  Yesterday, in fact, I rolled my first Bloodied Gauss Pistol.
---
It's really not that remarkable.  My Bloodied Western Revolver hits way harder against the Queen (&gt; 600 damage a shot) and isn't that much slower, barring the fact that the Gauss Pistol has a much larger magazine.
---
Taking it through a silo, the main benefit was that it hit hard while having a Silenced option, but I could silence my Bloodied Pipe Revolver too and I'm pretty sure that would one-shot everything in there.  VATS is generally unreliable.  Most of the time it connects, but when it doesn't, you've got this awkward pause of having to charge up before trying again.
---
The Silencer does no favors for range, but at the same time, when my scoped Western Revolver can hit something so far away and deal more damage, why would I ever opt for the closer-range shotgun-style damage of the Gauss Pistol?
---
Lol didn’t see your edit either. 
---
Thanks anyway man
---
Definitely stay away until you are a much higher level.
---
Yea no..  it nice to think it work like that but it not what they mention
---
And that was literally my point - if they weren't trying, imagine how much of a shithole this sub would be.
---
You will find out soon enough young tadpole
---
I’m level 450 plus
---
&gt;I’m thinking of just buying the recipes again and offering them for drastically reduced prices at my vendor but if there’s a more productive, albeit less benevolent way to spend them, I’m all ears. 
---
I literally had this idea for when I get to this point. And I think it's a great idea. More so, if you could think of some kind of event on the forums or ingame, could be great as well.
---
Then it sounds like imposing your own limitations to your character and build would be the way to keep things interesting.
---
For instance, doing a wanderer playthrough where you never touch the camp or stash except for quest reasons. What you have available to you is what you can carry any nothing more. In order to do crafting or sleep, you have to use world resources or other people's camps.
---
Or doing a run where you don't craft or modify anything. So to get better gear, you have to find it or buy it. Maybe with the exception of PA but you could also just have it where you can't learn and plans or craft but you can buy modules to fit.
---
Yeah the double robot creation pods by the back parking lot is where I finished off a few of the Atom challenges.
---
Now kiss!
---
Ghillie is pointless and is a poor effort as pointlessness at that :-)
---
Yeah, currently there are neither ultralight or deep pockets for limbs. They are in the files, but for whatever reason, BGS hasn't enabled them yet.
---
Hell yea
---
The serums from the WS Bunker can be anywhere from 21k to 17k with perks on. 
---
I’d love to surprise some folks with cheap Marsupial serums at my vendor but knowing the game some level 500 will snap it up before a level 50 can.
---
What kind are they? They aren't Berserker, are they?
---
Considering that we can only donate in batches of 250, which can't give a remainder of 1, it's fair to assume that they just gave us the extra missing concrete. I wonder what the actual amount was...
---
I tend to do the same and as well if I see leader of the pack running and no lls doing it ill take the 3 legs ,mod them up and drop them as well from time to time.
---
Yeah. Sadly Bethesda are what they are. Would like to think that they could change for the better but if that truly was the case, they would have done so by now.
---
Fo1st member here:
---
1) Stash absolutely brimming with spare junk.
---
2) Not donating a damned thing.
---
3) Not going to collect the items in the shop after Beth gives them away for free even after we fail the cork donations.
---
Gosh I hope next season has more variety. There are only so many onslaught and ghillie skins I can take
---
You can try to argue that the individual rewards aren’t great, but at best 250 cork bulked gets you 213 caps (based on value of 34 for the item and max CHA), I don’t have players swarming to my camp to buy bulk Cork off me (or concrete for that matter), I’ve only ever sold steel, lead, and acid.
---
On average you are getting about 100 caps straight up from the provisions, and you are getting some plans that have value greater than 250.  Some of those plans (in particular the raider armor ones) are rare not something you can buy from vendors.  
---
This is a way to exceed your standard caps for the day by turning in junk that is otherwise not of any value to you (or anyone else), as well as earn some rare plans.  Even with all the duping that happened, I don’t see a ton of raider armor plans out there, and some people do like to collect them.
---
If you can’t find any value in these rewards, that’s on you.
---
Don´t you dare coming after that song, That song is the best song ever..... PERIOD.
---
They’re not that good anyway
---
Im a day one player,when I first started playing pretty much everybody was doing the weight glitch and to be honest there were alot more players.
---
as soon as they patched it and up the stash/carry limit people stayed but not too long.
---
We need to all be realistic about the handling of limitations in this game,it's unrealistic,the game demands you to multi task,carry and sell a bunch of crap its like having a job but the pay dosen't match the cost of living,The glitchs I can some what live with and the micro transactions OK games needs to make money and its a choice to buy the stuff or not,but seriously they really should with each update give us a decent limit raise,it not tough if so the game is more broken then we thought it was.
---
I’m happy to see a positive post! I’ve enjoyed fo76 since it came out, and it’s always been a game that I can get back into. I recently bought fallout 1st as well, and my friends and I have started completely new characters. It’s fun to experience the quest lines and scavenging all over again. Personally, I’ve never had any known issues with bugs preventing play time and quality. To each their own!
---
No, The standard minigun is a junkies, &amp; the gauze is just a vampires
---
Because it was a poorly planned event
---
damn I want on that servier
---
100% agree. I normally take Lakeside Cabins to do a fun build and then Poseidon for fusion cores now and then, both of them are absolutely miserable. Especially lakeside cabins when a wave engages enemies out in the lake or get stuck under the stone stairs. Fast travel away, come back wit fingers crossed, repeat. 
---
Just as a side note: I really think the defend events would be more worthwhile if they afforded at least a chance that legendaries could spawn. Then people may actually show up to do it together. Right now if I’m doing something, I’ll just wait until I’m done and show up later for the retake event.
---
Actually it is because people forgot that NPC vendors sell bulk concrete. The same with cork and all the other resources. So while they are bitching about how hard it is to find it and to store all of it without 1st. I log in and after 10 minutes donate scrap to the event and move on with my day.  Concrete was daily 500. Cork is less only because vendors sell less cork then they do concrete. 
---
But rather then do this people whine on the sub reddit and down vote people for pointing out you can do this.
---
Good post, the harm in this case is that you are wasting your time collecting and donating stuff for rewards you will get regardless whether you do or not bc Bethesda will auto complete it for you, unless you really are into individual rewards for some reason then yeah I can understand.Bottom line is for high levels the reasons to participate in that event is merely a waste of time unless you're really bored and dont know what else to do in fo76
---
Hell a few guns should get this option (magazines taped together etc)
---
man i’ve had a couple pcs i’m not totally technologically illiterate either it’s just annoying. I constantly had driver issues and the like it’s just not for everyone. we’ve just got the last notable ps4 exclusive I believe? hopefully one day you won’t be forced into buying a console just to play a certain game. I think it’s moving more towards that. All my friends on playstation have barely touched the exclusives. I can’t even think of any upcoming ps5 exclusives except Miles morales. maybe another god of war? or at least can’t think of any that I wanna play other than those but then again i’m just little ole me . I really don’t think it should be argued that a positive of the playstation is that they play hardball with exclusives. The Xbox will always have fans that it will appeal to regardless, I really think this generation xbox will be getting back where it was or at the very least it’ll be a lot closer. maybe not at first because of the general attitude this generation  but it’s coming.
---
I’ve been very meticulous about buying any and every recipe I’ve come across since I was a low level so I believe I have all the food/drink ones. 
---
I think you’re dead on about buying vs farming materials and ammo though. Time to make it rain on some player vendors!
---
I think more people would bother with them if there was a chance legendaries could spawn. Talking 1, 2, or 3 stars. Not just low levels.
---
Yeah the animated cards give 5x the perk coins for the legendary card system, so you would want to upgrade any animated cards and sell them, meaning if you are using one you are out of luck
---
Check your addictions.
---
So what happens after you finish it? You continue getting SCORE or???
---
What you expect from a forum where half of its users is dupers? You talk shit about dupers then you get bombarded with dislikes and get your post deleted. Players should moderate themselves before demanding something. Even non-trolls are toxic cheaters
---
I meant the stealth bonus because of the silencer.  Sorry for the confusion.  
---
Basically I meant that all the powerful guns in the game are using suppressors. Your fixers, handmades, lever actions, etc.
---
Yeah... idk what they were doing with that one honestly
---
I probably have in the first couple builds but not recently. Is there some trick to where it's placed?
---
It was such a popular request, we definitely see all of them and were happy to add this in here. :)
---
So not only you want me to waste my time but now also waste my caps ? For what purpose ? I will get the cosmetics and rewards regardless bc Bethesda will autocomplete it for so tell me why I should put my time and caps into this,when the individual rewards are definitely  not worth it
---
I dont even like having to change characters let alone restart the game several times changing ini files, i know its in theory really easy, but im too lazy to do it
---
Thanks, That may be it.

Went from there 176 to 180 yesterday. I can see how it’d be annoying, but Bethesda’s just trying to give high Int builds a reason to exist. It was an almost useless stat till your lvl started meaning something
---
Right, but that’s still a good thing to hear
---
I totally agree with you. 
---
However, this community is majorly made up of two types of people: Ones that make posts complaining about there being content but no fixes, and ones that complain about there being no new content despite bugs being fixed. 
---
Now, I’m not just trying to group you into a general group, OP. I totally agree with you, and I don’t think you’re just complying. You’re trying to be constructive, and I’d say I’m in the same boat as you. 
---
But, what I am saying is that no matter what Bethesda does, either fixing the game or adding yet another Mr. Fuzzy ride into the Atomic Shop, people will still complain. Which is too bad. It’d be nice if Bethesda would at least bring on some kidders from past games, such as the guy that made NVAC for New Vegas or the one that made FO4UP.
---
If you're on xbox I may still have mine. I'll check during my lunch I don't mind parting with them!
---
Rad rumble is also great for xp if you have the dmg for it
---
This man's never seen an invincible radroach 
---
I fear no man. But that thing... It scares me
---
yeah because throwing fuck tons of shit at us expecting us to do something with it yet giving us so little carry weight and weighs to get rid of it without it becoming trash is definitely our fault.
---
I really wish there was a way to allow only low level players to buy my reduced price serums but I’d hate to go through all that effort for a high level player to come by and purchase them to make a quick profit.
---
You've never heard of Anthem?
---
That's a good point and a great way to make caps, but I was talking about the participatuon in the so called event it self

i have two characters at level 200. thats two stash boxes with a total clearance of like 7 lbs between them.
---
give us a Vault Tec Cubby- You place it in your camp, once you put something inside of it, you can get it from another character on your account- wall it off behind a mission early on, call it like ‘The Vault Tec Exchange’ and it can basically be the functional mailbox weve all been begging for! even if its just for sending stuff to ourselves
---
Np
---
Yes, every bug, glitch and unfriendly mechanic here that makes this game feel like a painful chore is absolutely self-created by the community in this game.
---
Thanks for all the suggestions! There's going to be a shortage of robots in Appalachia when I'm finished.
---
Congrats! I got level 83 last night and I can't wait to be done and then take a break. I feel like I am working a second job lol. I just really want those last few rewards. I do most of the NW ones (never when i have to kill someone as I am terrible at pvp), I am an annoying bush wookie.
---
Picked upa quad explosive L1 pipe gun last night that would have mad e agood twink weapon if i didnt already have all 5 char slots filled. EZ 40 scrip. Thx L1 feral ghoul in Flatwoods.

We are discussing what it would take to implement double-sided walls into the game. This is definitely something we want to bring to you all!

I've noticed this only when wearing Power Armor. It's really odd.
---
We're working on a fix towards this, it unfortunately probably won't make it in until the next patch, however.
---
Pro tip: since workshops have free resources, use them to build elaborate structures and blue print them (be aware of blueprint budget though). 
---
You can then bring these structures into nuclear winter. Makes for some fun matches.

If you hate NW, just ignore this pro tip.

I see your Posseidon Energy and raise you a Mount Blair.  Clearing out to take the place and trying to find the last few mobs before the number gets low enough to tag is a giant pain.  They like to wander all over the place.
---
LOL.. I wish there was something.  I'm also around same level. With the exception of the once a week I buy bullion for 6k, i'm permanently stuck at the 30k cap.  I can't find things to spend any caps on.  I'm like Walmart with the prices I sell at, so I fill up fast.   
---
(no interest in creating other characters)
---
A while ago they were discussing increasing the photo limit on consoles, I'll ask around and see what happened to that.
---
FYI, You can't nuke 6 times on a row.  Each of the 3 silos has a 2 hour cool down period after a nuke has been launched.
---
Seriously. I want to play more, but I have a backlog of trashy legendary items to sell and I feel pressured to log out every time I'm close to leveling up 2nd time for the day because I don't want to slog through a whole level for the daily. 
---
Wouldn't even be bothered by the latter because of all the ways to grind and XP bonuses, but the scrip cap leaves me with nothing meaningful to do.
---
I pretty sure they mean that everyone is solo.

Set down a cheap generator. Mobs hate those.

It's one of the many cans of worms Bethesda opened by trying to draw their playerbase into a typical MMO gameplay cycle after finally making their "see that clutter, you can pick it up" design approach have appreciable rewards with Fallout 4's crafting and storage systems.
---
I would really like that but then we're coming up with nothing more than a watered down lever action rifle. Would have to supplement it with something like a str perk that gives you bonus damage when fired out of vats to make it competitive
---
It was an analogy but you dont seem smart enough to know what that is so I get it. And by literally going to everyone of my posts just to downvote me proves my point that your just butt hurt that you had a stupid ass idea and I called you out. The fact that still not a single person agreed with you make you super angry, and your  throwing a temper tantrum about
---
I wonder if the Brotherhood Skull cap would?  It does rather well with the Enclave scout mask.
---
Limits, all of them.
---
And I got plenty of scrap thanks
---
And at least 1 3 star. It’s a must do event for me when I see it. Very underrated.
---
No, it really isn't
---
I don't understand that 'good loot' part.
---
No way to prevent them from joining except unfriend them all lol.
---
I feel you on not creating Alt Accounts. Fundamentally I don’t want to have to make a second player just to spread out my daily, weight and currency limits.
---
Again it’s that word harm. There is no harm done. And since your aren’t required to contribute to get the rewards. Doing so is the players choice. 
---
And if a player choose to contribute they aren’t wasting their time. Because they decided to do it.
---
It doesn’t matter either if Bethesda auto completes or not. If a player decides to contribute or not, hopefully they had fun.
---
The individual rewards and the community rewards aren’t interesting to me. But I’m still contributing. Me and my friends are making it fun. We all had a bunch of savage divide treasure maps. So we stared at the bottom of the SD. We worked our way up hitting every location on the map, and any building not marked to see how much concrete we could find. 
---
Got all the way up to Whitesprings that session. We learned things about spots we normally don’t consider. We found things we didn’t know before. We’re all over level 160. Most playing since launch. 
---
The game is what you make if it. I don’t find this different from any other game. It’s all on what you make of it.
---
I just buy ammo.  With bandolier rank 2 I'm usually carrying between 200k and 300k in ammo.
---
Those bastards!!!
---
I generally wait until it's a retake quest myself unless I happened to be on the workshop or if I see it's 1 wave of something easy.  Anything that burrows is the bane of my existence as they always seem to burrow clear across the country and I spend 15 minutes tracking 'em down.
---
Oh that is soo awesome .... when I get some free time Im so going to build this, put on the Hotrod PA Paint and run up to everything and uppercut it it in the face. 😂 that looks so fun.
---
Yeah.. plus, once you get used to be a super muty with 11 mutations... starting from scratch is a slog... I'm used to flying everywhere.
---
I hit my scrip, gold and caps cap a few mins after I log in every day the score grind took me from like lvl 80 to 220 something I finished score last night(lvl 100)  I still have an entire box of legendary weapons and armor to sell to the machine before I can get some storage back ... 
---
I didn’t have to farm as much XP and rush through it but it just kind of happened
---
imposter sheepsquatch
---
Plans, legendary weapons, etc.
---
Just wait til you get the 1* nocturnal rolling pin from the SBQ.  A true, enlightening experience.
---
Tank killer for pistol (and shotguns) makes perfect sense because currently the only way to penetrate armor are crits. You can mitigate the problem by pushing raw damage with bloodied or junkies, but thats not the point. Every other weapon class has a perk for it, even bows got it with Bow before me.
---
I don't have an update on if this will be fixed before 22 or not, once we get some information on this we will let you all know.

Oh I don’t care about the event, I’m just using it as a way to unload scrap to get extra caps.  
---
The idea of the event isn’t a bad one, I think more things like this should be permanent additions to the game, this would give people reason to Keep playing every day as they could keep farming “thing” and turning them in.  They should be smaller bundles like 50, and should be a wider range of things including chems, foods, non-legendary weapons/armor, specific junk types, and of course scrap.  If it was permanent, repeatable unlimited times per day, and had good rewards (even with low %) it would be worth doing.
---
Example:  If there was an NPC in Crater that had a psycho addiction, every time you turn in 10 psycho to them, they gave you a reward.  Most rewards could be Jack, but if the reward include rare consumable items (it’d be great to give out lunchboxes or repair kits), rare raider themed outfits, or even give out some legendary modules, I would keep going and even try to craft the psycho or keep farming ghouls to pick up enough to turn in a few times a day.  
---
But again, the rewards have to be worthwhile.  Reward has to be at least worth the effort.  This current event I’m only turning in scrap because it’s non-effort.  It’s stuff I had sitting in my scrap box for months that’s just not being used.  I didn’t turn in concrete because I actually use it in my camp.  Cork on the other hand, not even sure what it’s used for.

I've been doing all this for about 250 levels, maybe a bit more.  I still run across a plan now and then that I don't have (mostly rarer ones, but every so often something simple pops up).  I have about 40K 5.56 on me all the time, and I've started buying 5mm (which is stupid) just to drain caps and open my shop back up.
---
My current goal is to stash any decent stuff on my alt and sell down (or just transfer) most of the good vendor items to free up stash space...even with 1st (which was GOING to be temporary while I was on furlough at work...) my stash is full.  Once I'm there...not sure.  Just keep grinding for legendary modules to get at least ONE good piece of SS armor :P  Plus the gold grind, which I've still got a lot of stuff to buy.
---
The board game was a good distraction for the first 50ish levels, but now it's more of a chore, but I'm almost done.  I think at the point I'm through that, I'll be on that last point and be ready to take a long hard look at my choices.
---
You can't equip unarmed while on power armor. Sorry to break your balls
---
They had their opportunity and end up with Wastelanders. I won't give Bethesda anymore trust anytime.
---
182 here, haven't used a single mutation yet... Think I'm doing well enough for myself. xD
---
How about dual wielding pistols and one hand melee
---
Imagine running around with an explosive 10mm and a ripper with jetpack power armor for the assault space marine vibes
---
Lol are you 5? I'm convinced now
---
I think the underlying problem is that they could spend six months fixing every bug, then the next bit of new content will break a half dozen things and we’re back where we started.
---
Not that I wouldn’t like a constant flow of new content or a bug free game, but it’s not a realistic expectation.  Im just going to enjoy the game for what it is.  When/if I stop enjoying it, I’ll move on.  I have fun playing, but it doesn’t rule my life.
---
I would be happy if updates update, yup xD
---
Ok I understand your point, unless you are actually  having fun doing  it then go for it and have fun I guess.
---
But your point is based on all the posts we don’t see? The thing is we have to see the post before they remove it. And we all see how many of these posts are. So it would seem the evidence is that to many posts aren’t getting moderated.
---
It would be an exploit if you could make this happen somehow. Like placing a tent somewhere (line in the sand). Every mob in the game has a fixed spawn location. Knowing and using them is not an exploit.
---
LOL
---
Wow so many people triggered lmao I'm lvl 307 with 1200 hour played I know what I'm talking about kids, I was using bloodied knuckles anyway dont use iron fist or got enough strength until legendary perks and I've stealth in this game for so long its boring I like rushing and bash more fun for me now after I used to stealth command with a non legendary handmade for abput 80% of my time playing this game just giving some advice to why people are are probably leaving your team seconds after they join
---
It sucks, but I just drop the trash SS items at times. It clears a bit of room out of my stash and gets those items gone. It would be preferrable to have a higher scrip limit or no limit to actually be able to get rid of them and still benefit in some way other than making carry weight or stash space.
---
Tesla bracers, rusty knuckles
---
Dual wielding pls, only way to get me intrested in pistols, would be so cool
---
just go buy another key card. they range from 1900-2300 depending if you use Hard Bargain.
---
Different. Go upstairs to the residential area and check all the terminals. You'll be prompted to look for clues to the Terminal password, and one of the terminals has an ID printer next to it. You'll use this to print an ID card.
---
The quest marker on this seems to be broken.
---
You have a lot of good question that most won't have the answer to. You should test it im curious on your findings. PA unarmed isn't top tier but im sure it can be a fun build overall
---
It's the circus trailer door.
---
I'm an adult with a job and shit to do. I only get to play once or twice a week or so. The only thing limits do for me is cut the time I play before I switch to something else.
---
Legit got lucky with the floater Grenade's AoE otherwise I wouldnt have gotten the mongrel that was stuck there
---
Never seen it, but the game has been horrendous in camp or workshop building mode.
---
Do melee stealth
---
That's the door for the circus cage. You need to know the plans. I believe they dropped from the mole miners event
---
Wrong keycard, they're looking to enter Garrahan Estate.
---
Your critiques are condescending and full of derision. You thinking this could pass as a review if actually laughable to me. But I will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you legitimately do not see how what you wrote is insulting, I don't have the time to explain tone to you.
---
oh, my bad... you get that in dudes house
---
No way. Is OP really going down that dreaded path? Then there's no way to break his balls cause it's obviously made out of iron
---
People can build you the door however. So you dont need to know the plan
---
I just use them, figure chuck em if you got em.
---
Exactly. But I think a lot of people expect the game to make it fun for them. And that comes down to what the reward they get. 
---
And I can’t say that’s invalid. However it often feels that those players are so vocal when something isn’t giving them something they find valid. 
---
You never hear it the other way around. Players don’t complain when content is put in that’s about getting high powered rewards.
---
oh, my bad
---
That would be cool, but only if you still had the ability to take it with you on the go. For players like me who play solo and only spend enough time at their camp to repair weapons/armor, it would be better to pull up a podcast on your phone
---
Red rocket jet pack looks great with the atomic onslaught paint.
---
Before the Bow was released, I would have said this is an excellent idea for alternative ammo types.
---
Now, it feels like having it as a weapon mod, or even a unique weapon feels more likely.
---
Either way, yeah, we need slugs for shotguns.
---
That's valid.
---
Because they cost gold to buy the plans.
---
&gt; It feels like I always have to play catch-up with the game since I haven't played in a while,  
---
And there is the core problem with your mentality. There is no catch up with the game. There is only YOUR goals and YOUR progression on those goals and nothing more.  I don't give a single solitary fuck about what everyone else does unless it directly impacts my game.  
---
The only actual "catch up" that exists in the game is the Legendary Run event. Which by the very nature of it and all the other variations of it in other games is designed to encourage people to log in every day or risk losing out on rewards.  Though I am saving final judgement about how well that runs until it is over. As I am of the mind that people who log in every day and do every challenge should be able to complete it in 50-75% of the event time allowing more freedom for people who can not do that to get farther into the reward pool.
---
As of right now it would take me 24 days of doing nothing but turning treasury notes in to get to zero.  Scrip probably isn’t to far behind, i’ve all but stopped picking up legendarys unless it’s something neat
---
It's definitely on their radar, I'm just unsure of when it will be fixed. It's an annoying bug but also a pretty minor one compared to what they are working on (VATS, fast travel, etc.). I'll keep pushing for this as well, though! Definitely want to wear it on my character as well!
---
I got mine on the 3rd pail... I was shocked, but very happy : )  only thing in mole miners I cared about.
---
LOL. So true. I literally had a duper making an account and send me a threatening PM. And then delete the account. 
---
And players do moderate the forums. There's so many bogus posts that are really trading posts. I report them and the are taken down.

---
Have fun tickling enemies
---
Yeah. We really need a middle finger emote so we can show off our masculinity and not be some sarcastic jerk
---
Happy to help
---
It proves that this is all a dream. They look at you because they sense that you know it's a dream. Inception.
---
you defend cheap tactics to bait people into playing and ignore the shitty mobile freemium aspects they keep pushing. why?
---
Oh, then I definitely would  take my main, I'm only lvl 160 xD
---
Not really....the range is still shit unless they added a slug barrel and then it should still be just beyond terrible.  What it's benefit would be is shear stopping(stagger) power.  That little .45 shell has nothing on a full ounce of lead in a 12 Guage slug shell.
---
You can use broken armor. Think I’ve seen people also using the Chinese stealth suit
---
Removing them from friends doesn't work, they pop right back in next time they log in, at least they always do on Beth launcher (PC) :-)
---
I would not be happy with that in the slightest  
---
Like yeah cool bugs are gone... so now I can do.. the same stuff i had been doing for months and months by that point, we're already at the point of gagging for new content, fuck waiting another 6 months for anything new.  
---
The key is balance, and also testing.  
---
Testing more so because as it seems bethesda does implement a lot of bug fixes, they are 'bug fixes' that either flat out dont work or break something else, if they did the same number of bug fixes but they actually worked the game would be in a dramatically better state then it currently is bug wise
---
people use broken armor to negate the DR and retain the legendary effect..
---
Yeah.
---
The new blood eagle fist emote is close.  But not close enough
---
Yes, done, but in a tedious manner, as OP said.
---
Todd: sure! only 59.99 euros..... per month
---
I thought everyone did this. I start with long arms then work through my cq rifles and a shorty down to two pistols. I never reload felt after a battle or if I have a few seconds n some cover.
---
I finished the run last night as well pretty burnt out tbh ..
---
I traded for it eventually because I was very new at the time that event happened, I didn't really know what was going on lol sad that cage is enormous and I've never placed it. I do, however, use the doors on every doorway and love them so it was totally worth it.
---
As is the case with most of the requests you see on here daily, its stuff thats either in the roadmap or bethesda has mentioned theyre working on
---
Yeah my thing with that though is there’s still no good legendary effects for a Zerker asides from added endurance
---
Yes I  believe so.  With an auto grenade launcher, for example, damage boost comes from demolition expert, but you still get armor penetration from stabilized.    I am pretty sure that I read that somewhere, but that was over a year ago.
---
Yeah I want another double XP to come out to grind more levels :3
---
And then each token weighs .25 and then you get people making the same thread because they're out of stash space again.
---
&gt; Just 8 minutes once a day of walking 
---
8 minutes of tedium, one might say?
---
Nice :)  Yeah, I have mine in my camp. Eventually I'll get around to taming a deathclaw and stick him in there  :)
---
Say it again for the Bethesda developers in back!
---
Yeah it definitely doesn't work all the time. If you get more than 1 or 2 waves I'd advise just leaving the area so you fail the defense event and get the retake event instead. Retake is always just 1 wave.
---
Or at least have those yellow markers individually, like when there's 1 o 2 left, but for all the hostiles (sometimes is glitched tho) but at least is better than the yellow area thing, makes me go around forever, is really annoying
---
Just in case they read this. This limit was messing with my fun juuust enough that I was able to listen to my sensible side telling me to play less video games. I canceled Fallout 1st and logged out one day a few weeks ago and I may never go back in. I enjoyed my time in FO76 but I didn't like the currency restrictions so I split.
---
I haven't been playing for a while because the grinds are so demoralizing but got a wild hair last night. Logged on, traded in some legendaries, hit max scrip. Did some dailies for the millionth time to squeak out 50 more scrip for 200, bought four legendary modules. Crafted a 1\* instigating and a 1\* mutant slayer gauss gatling LOL. I felt so, so stupid for even turning the game back on. Turned it right back off.
---
Should be next week
---
I’ve all but stopped scrapping legendaries. If I’m not going to use them, I just sell them to vendors for caps or try to sell them in my vendors if I think they may fetch a decent price ( though I sell well under market value).
---
What?! You dropped sugar?!
---
I would have bought/traded for that sweet, sweet sugar, because my guy basically lives off hard lemonade.
---
Right on, thanks everybody
---
Thanks
---
It’s a safety net in case you missed the free plan issued during the Wastelanders campaign. Bethesda knew that this would be a highly sought after reward, so they built in a second chance to get it.
---
The common misperception is that if you side with one faction, you cannot do any quests for the other. The reality is there is no lockout. You can take both factions up to “Siding With” decision quest marker, netting you all possible quest rewards for both factions up until it is time to enter Vault 79. After raiding 79, you can still take both factions to Ally status to unlock gold bullion plans for both sides.
---
That's just awful. If you're on PC I got a spare Final Word you can have.
---
1. I believe strong back does work as it just adds capacity to you max.  I do not use it personally as I can achieve 565 carry weight easily enough in my excavator armor.  Anything worn under the armor does NOT count at all when in power armor.  This includes backpacks.  However, if you use calibrated shocks, backpacks are irrelevant and only serve to help you remain unoverencumbered when outside your armor.
---
2. I dont know specifics, but with a running power attack at max strength and no perks for it, it was hard to attain one shots on even low level (lvl 12) enemies with buffs.  So the damage is not good.  This was a long time ago though, so you'd have to do your own testing for accuracy.
---
3. As far as the game is concerned,  pa fists are just fists.  They are not unarmed weapons.  For the kill 76 scorched with fist or unarmed weapons, pa fists did not count.  I had to get out and use a dcg.  So I would assume melee/unarmed perks that do not work for just fists will not work for PA.
---
Afterword.
---
This is just from my own experience and what I have seen and heard.  So any testing that proves otherwise is likely more valid.  This is a difficult path you have chosen.  And your damage output will most likely always be trash.  Be prepared for this eventuality, as there are some enemies that not even power armor can save you from if you cant kill them fast enough.
---
Yes I know about that I didn’t include it till I instantly got 2 comments about it cause I figured my point was clear that bezerker doesn’t have a good prefix.
---
I don't defend them I ignore them. I drop legendary gear all the fucking time when my script limit is reached.  I use the cap system in vendors to sell extra useless shit to get the 1.4k limit and then buy bulk lead and steel to make ammo while selling even more shit back to them so I get a shit load of ammo resources with little actual cost to me.
---
Ooh I love that idea!
---
Of which very few actually affect anything OP is talking about.
---
Oh okay thanks. 
---
It’s not just my sight then
---
Most of my weight is scrap, give me an unlimited weight scrap locker with auto bulk converter.  I’ll buy all the plastic to feed the thing.
---
That would be pretty stupid.  The lode baring tokens weight is bad, I agree.  But most other currency weighs nothing: caps, scrip, treasury notes, possum badges, tadpole badges, overseer tokens, camden park tokens, even gold bullion weighs nothing (despite real gold being damned heavy).  So I don't think they'd make that mistake... but who knows.
---
No problem, was curious if I missed something when I tried to get a pipe working for me/my playstyle. 
---
Most vats/crit gunslingers don't - or I should say can't - focus on stealth anyway because they need the points in AG for weapon perks, not much left for things like sneak and Escape artist. Still, getting a few shots off while hidden helps a lot.
---
So why not just drop legendary shit when you are full? I do it all the time. You horde pointless shit and then get upset that your pointless hording has a negative effect.
---
Wow... I don't even know where to begin.
---
Tank Killer makes sense for rifles by what it references - anti material rifles that were - wait for it... tank killers.
---
Remind me again which shotguns and pistols had that kind of capability?
---
Forget about armour piercing and shotguns, at least not in the context of the game as they're all shot cartridges. That's not a thing.
---
Pistols do have AP options but that's reflected in the mag mods you have with the magazine based pistols.
---
Now, that's separate from the need to tweak shotguns and pistols. Shotguns especially could do with some love. 
---
I just don't think having a tank killer perk for them is the way to go. They should have their own niche that leverages what are good about each. Maybe CC for shotguns so you can hit multiple enemies at once and both OP and I have stated some pistol improvements that are still flavourful and relevant.
---
Yes, mounted heads are way too many and annoying, but I have over 100 plans in my camp (only a few of them are more than 1-2) and no ultracite armor pieces xD so I wouldn't judge everyone.
---
While a post with duper whining about the banhammer isn't getting moderated but rather getting massive upvotes. Funny thing is, I once made a sarcastic post urging players to dupe cause Bethesda won't do jack shit and I got suspended for 1 month. And I was really baffled to see actual dupers not getting banned but getting thousands of upvotes I mean wtf
---
We need more things like this! It’s simple but really brings the world to life.
---
Wdym I had the same amount of daily and weekly challenges
---
I love when they're locked inside a house at Abandoned Bog Town and you need to rescue them first.
---
That'll happen when they remove cap limit, so probably never if I was guessing.  I just want a shared bank or something, or to share my scrap box between characters, since that's how the similar features work with a membership on ESO
---
It was worth it to me just for the private server.  It felt like a proper Fallout game.
---
"I accidentally one shot a legendary with my extremely OP weapon and build" yeah the thing is, this happens all the time and people are gonna be pissy whether or not you throw an emote at them lol
---
Wdym? We already had several 6-months-without-content phases :)
---
Lol this literally got me into an argument with my girlfriend last night because she thought I was taking my sweet ass time respawning when she was being chased by liberators hahaha
---
oh yeah, I really want to finish this season at least because I'm about to move and won't be able to play daily for hours to grind next season xD
---
Funny thing is, sometimes I do it on purpose.
---
After all. It's been done to me so many fucking times.
---
I have a horrible feeling that once I donate all of my cork [just over 500], Bethesda will come out with some fancy item that requires a ton of cork to make.....
---
How many did you get?
---
Context. That event has been controversial for legendary one shots. People probably presuming the worst.
---
The original mods of this forum, were also mods of the Fallout Forum, where open bashing of FO76 was totally acceptable. And while those mods are gone from here, who says that sentiment doesn't continue? 
---
It gets ridiculous sometimes.
---
You should buy legendary modules early on, you’ll need them later to craft secrete service armour with the legendary affects u want
---
It's the same amount of weekly challenges as usual. They're just easier this week
---
Good idea, I'll do the same next time :D
---
My wish list for this game is maybe a mile long, but this might be my #1.  The scrip limit for legendaries is AWFUL, especially if you're doing a ton of events to get XP/score OR if you're crafting Secret Service armor.  
---
I've started selling my legendaries at the regular vendors, but I can't sell my SS armor there.  So my options are drop the ones I don't need, or carry around an extra 20-30 pounds of weight until the scrip limit resets.
---
I figured they were doing something like that!
---
I found that not having help from other players made the early game *harder*, which I liked.
---
LOL. The Cork Armor. A full sets makes you immune to the Scorch Beast sonic attack. Each piece requires between 150-300 cork.
---
Bulk it then scrap it then bulk it I guess, again roughly +30% every time you repeat if the maths add up, at the cost of 2 plastic, unless super duper doesnt affect bulking but I'm sure it does
---
How do you buy those? I seen turning in legendaries for script. Do you use that to buy the modules?
---
Just poor game design, like the effectiveness of the grenades themself, like what is with that explosion radius? I'm certain the Nuka Quantum grenade is just as useless too.
---
There were the proper amount of weeklies. You just got jipped.that being said I got them all done, except the level 3 times, done in less than 2 hours yesterday. Including my dailies
---
You could use super duper to craft pipe weapons, then scrap em for cork. But I think you need rank 3 of super duper to guarantee a higher output qty.
---
There are a number of these little vignettes around the place. I really love them too. 
---
It goes to show that there is some passion and talent amongst all the mismanagement and incompetence. It's such a shame that it's in a game with the reputation that 76 has.
---
I would like to see stuff like this implemented on all weapon types. Stances for melee, use of our other hand...
---
Maybe it's a hint that they know they're screwing up, so they hint that they're sorry xD probably not, but I like to lie to myself.
---
The game seems to hit the compulsive really hard, unfortunately. And it's a mutant beast of a game. One of my favorite areas is a set of cabins where the owners could play spooky pranks on guests. But because it's not grindable, you only go there once, if at all, if you get sucked into the top level grind. There's a great solo game in here.
---
Do you know about the filthy casuals fo76 subreddit?
---
Super duper doesn't apply to bulked items, according to a wiki I quickly googled. But whatevs.
---
thanks a lot man and i can assure you, it is fun especially when you are at an event, peoples reactions can be quite entertaining :D
---
hope you will enjoy it :)
---
I’ve already gotten 100 in the season around a week and a half ago, during double XP I stacked lunchboxes and food/Chems/perks to get around 350 to 400% XP per kill, was insane
---
Army helmet  looks cool /funny and doesn’t clip

Every Tuesday around 12 pm EDT we release an Atomic Shop article on [Fallout.com](https://Fallout.com) that tells you the current sales and how long they last. Hope that helps, [here is this weeks.](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4yv87wiyzzymMG5VPuyLuE/atomic-shop-weekly-update-august-11-18)
---
I think you can go across the street to the factory and into the office on the first floor and find that keycard to enter the estate if not there, you have to go back to Charleston and into the offices there and find it in one of the executive's offices. That same keycard will allow you to access additional drop boxes in the Breach &amp; Clear event, too.
---
I do it because I don’t have anything better to do...
---
True and most people who enjoy the game and camp building would log on every week to check the atom shop anyways
---
I figured there was some kinda of control for it, but serious question, does anything in this game work as intended? This is my second time sitting down with it, the first time was unplayable, but this time around I’m having fun but it is still buggy as high hell, they got the game working for the most part but god damn yanno!
---
I don’t do that challenge everyday.
---
Alright, that was my only guess lol.
---
I log in with my main to do dailies and challenges and play for an hour or two and never see nukes the whole time.
---
Switch to a low level alt to quickly get the level up challenge done.....someone nukes the queen 6 times in a row.  A bit of an exaggeration but it never seems to fail.  
---
If I can find a public team spot that will give me a free fast travel point to the event I will show up with my level 2 throwaway character and try to hit the queen with a level 1 machete though.
---
Ha!

I can block for session or fully remove but it’s a pain in the rear. Just wish the team only function worked as it says ha
---
Same! I hit golf courses, but they were picked clean. Just couldn’t scrape up enough for a donation.
---
the sarcasm was implied.
---
That would really remove the incentive for a lot of us to go visit vendors. Also, there are some  plans I never intend to purchase and don't want them tainting my brain. Like Santa Crash. 
---
I'd rather be "suckered" as you put it, simply because I might buy a plan I already know, but that I know a friend of mine or alt doesn't.
---
&gt;I don’t think it will be that server intensive ***if coded well***.
---
Ahahahahahaha
---
hahaha
---
ha
---
Well, you just destroyed your own case there.
---
Yeah, turn in 150 script worth of legandarys everyday and it always resets 20 hours after you first script anything, u can also get a little script from completing daily quests but the daily’s quests get boring
---
You can just go into your system settings and change the time there. It'll make the game think enough time has passed.
---
This totally works and you should definitely trust me on this.
---
Camps are going, instanced, so size limits won't be issue.
---
People will read BM or trolling into stuff that is nothing of the sort. There are games where a thank you or well played emote is considered hostile or passive aggressive, even when it makes sense in context.
---
I wouldn't think too much of it.
---
Ain’t run into invincible rad roaches yet, but I’ve had to run away from invincible dogs and those fuckers are fast lmao
---
If what you are saying is that you don't have the keycard to go up the elevator, they have it in the Mining HQ, at the desk all the way in the back when you first enter.
---
That's my point, I've only ever done them a few times and never do it again. Of it was more rewarding, like giving a bunch of score, then it would be worth it and people would do it more often
---
Congratulations for entirely missing the point.
---
Kill everything. Loot their things. Sell their things.
---
It’s likely because, in their minds, a Berserker build wouldn’t be wearing any armor. Why make an armor prefix for a build that gets weaker by wearing armor?
---
Pick up everything, sell them at train station robot vendors for the daily (or 20h) 1400 cap.
---
Can't wait for the inevitable "equip all your perk cards at once lol" exploit.
---
In all seriousness though yeah, as long as I can hotkey a load out rather than having to navigate the menu for it. F6 for crafting, F7 for fighting etc.
---
You choose to believe what you think, and I'll choose to understand what I know.
---
Have you met Jide? Fuck that guy
---
Theoretically, one of these days, I'm going to get those shocks to drop. Then you'll see!
---
have a rifleman build that I used at level 110 with no mutations. honestly they feel like a crutch to me, propping up bad gameplay habits. all I needed were some specific perk cards and a decent lever action.
---
Noted
---
I sell mothman egg omelets along with whatever excess chems and junk I've accumulated since the previous day to get the daily vendor caps limit..
---
i throw on maxed Hard Bargain and use whatever other cha buffs I can stack
---
I agree with first. It should be one or the other. Not both. Considering that you can only show as many items in a display, that items put on display count only against CAMP budget. 
---
I agree with the second. Better info is always better. 
---
The third doesn't bother me. I just think they often take pictures in multiple lighting and it makes it hard to know the colors. But not against it.
---
They are making displays for both armor and power armor.
---
I really don't know about displayed item weights. Saw some cheater or hacker come up with a massive wall on his camp with hundreds of items displayed and my fps dropped to like below 20. Had to leave server cause I don't like my gpu getting fried. No way that's healthy for the game
---
You should use travel agent lol join public teams to use their camps as free travel to get closer to your destination. Never buy heals or ammo or even plans from vendor bots. When you have more caps, buy stuff from other players for cheap. You need to max out your 1400 caps selling to vendors bots. You could sell water or craft food and sell it. Sell the crap guns you pick up instead of scrapping them till you hit the cap max.
---
Stop fast traveling. I have no money and buy tons of fast food. Then stop

That might explain the insane looking structure I saw at Hemlock Maint. Strange platforms with stairs to nowhere and a lot of sinks.
---
&gt;So not only you want me to waste my time but now also waste my caps ?
---
A single radiation rumble event if you loot all the items there will yield at least 600 caps worth of scrap or other items like glowing blood. To buy 500 concrete only cost around 400 caps.  And that is on top of dailies and events that allow give you anywhere from 50-300 caps per completion.   
---
Shit a quick trip to Point Pleasant can get me 200-300 caps worth of moth-man eggs depending on how lucky I am with Super Duper perk activating when cooking them. 
---
Also with vendors when you buy things a portion of your caps goes back into their cap stash. Which can allow you to sell more things to them and get most of your money back.  I use this trick all the time to buy a shit load of steel and lead for ammo while losing very little caps.   
---
If your new I can understand why you wouldn't know about this. But if you have been playing for a while you should have picked up on this simple thing.
---
Assuming Sony is doing what Microsoft is, the game shouldn’t need backwards compatibility, it’ll just be revised to be next gen compatible. Same way gta 5 porter straight over from the 360, but this should be free.
---
I got the normal amount of weekly challenges.
---
Nah just get a radiation suit and tag enemies, they agro onto higher levels
---
I heard that they will be doing a bunker sort of feature  for camps, and inside that bunker would be instanced interior. Also providing more freedom with building and what not. I cannot 100% how true this is though.
---
Ok I do join public teams whenever I play cuz I get bonus caps and exp whenever my teammates complete missions
---
I get what your saying. My suggestion was to keep changes simple and easy. Beth already has enough trouble changing things and not breaking shit.
---
I can get behind a stealth bonus and AP reduction though. Especially since the sneak skills are in agility whichs is one of the primary reasons for suggestion the damage cards be moved to perception. However this stealth bonus doesnt do much for revolvers or energy pistols. 
---
Hipfire isnt really helpful. In order to do well with handguns you absolutely need vats/critcal hits to do more damage and get through enemy DR, whichs lead to the suggestion of tank killer. Bloodied being the exception as always.
---
As for fanning the hammer thats easy, just like rdr if you sre hipfiring or in vats ,hold the trigger down (approx 1/4 second) and it begins to fan the hammer like an automatic weapon. It works VERY well in rdr.
---
Along the lines of your thinking i could see a few things that would make handguns stand out (some of your idea included)
---
- ability to stay sprint in sneak to take advantage of low AP sprint that you suggested 
---
- extremely low AP cost in vata
---
- enhanced vats accuracy 
---
- base stealth increased (think the fixer)
---
- perform critical hits ouside of vats (game changer) 
---
- increased damage to enemy weak spots
---
- dual weild
---
- hammer fan for single action
---
- big bore 5 shot caliber for western revolver that hits for crazy damage
---
- maybe some sort of stun effect when using a revolver and enemies are close. Help when you get swarmed and dont have the option of stealth.
---
&gt;	-	Items being displayed or for sale should not count in the total “weight” of the C.A.M.P. stash
---
&gt;It’s counter-intuitive to have a game that wants you to get so involved with it’s lore while at the same time punishing you for gathering trophies and memories from your adventures
---
Stash weight is there for a reason. This essentially is a workaround to give everyone a huge stash increase. Servers would not be happy.
---
I'm still trying to get stimpack diffuser
---
Which is a way of saying, your belief is better than evidence. That's fine. Are you a mod for this forum? That would explain soooo much.
---
I actually took the emote more as a tongue and cheek response from Bethesda as to the state of the game/recent update/how they handled the SCORE system.
---
Ok I’ll try
---
This is how I've saved ones I've had to delete from then in game gallery. Not ideal, but it works.
---
It's way less tedious than grinding Westek for a few hours to bring a level 285 to 286. The trek from level 2 to 3 has become sort of a speedrun that I don't mind trying to improve daily for some simple score.
---
To get god roll secret service armour on every piece it’ll probably cost thousands and thousands of legendary modules, UY(1 star) AP refresh (2 star) harder to detect while sneaking (3 star)
---
Could be! Or just doing the weekly challenge.
---
Yeah I'm aware of that, which really sucks, but at least for the most part I'll be free from power armor.
---
But you "generally" don't have 3 waves of 15+  radscorpions
---
Definitely do all of the Raider &amp; Settler quests before choosing your side for the Vault 79 raid.
---
Well, when you put it like that...
---
Still give it a try if i get any two shot explosive.
---
M79 two shot using vats is great
---
Because Nuclear Energy dominated the energy sector, I believe there is only 1 known solar power plant and its in the Mojave
---
Yep.
---
In a game full of level 200+ 1 shotters..
---
It's hilarious seeing the 400+ crying about a 1 star.
---
Then they put proceed to one shot the other legendaries.
---
Hypocrisy runs high in Uranium.
---
U buy them at the scam artist/EA/Activision shop, the prevoyur
---
Yeah I'll have to just wait and see I guess. If I remember I'll post some findings when I get to that point.
---
Rainbow six siege did this with operation health.  It was worth it in retrospect.  Now the game is one of the most popular multiplayer games there is.
---
If they hadn't fixed underlying bugs.  The game would have failed.  Even today granted it has its bugs.  But it's in a far better place than it used to be.
---
i thought thats what wastelanders was supposed to be...
---
Maybe they can add a barbarian/zerk under armor that acts like unyielding that adds HP and stat bonuses the less DR you have and a percentage decrease of damage taken instead of DR
---
If you're fast traveling to camps, take all their water if their purifiers are unlocked.
---
Are you selling unwanted items to players via a vending machine? And excess chems/purified water to vendor bots?
---
Daily quests pay out decent caps. 
---
But first and foremost you have to cut your fast travel expenses. If you must FT, look to see if there is a free FT travel point closer to your destination than you are currently (your or a teammate’s camp, a teammate’s current location, Vault 76). You can FT in two steps - first FT to the free spot, and then FT again to your final destination. That can cut the cost significantly, especially if you are going to the other side of the map. Be strategic with your fast travel!
---
65.82m cork for the first day... hmmmmmmm Lots of dupers or Bethesda's the one pulling the strings here,,
---
I wouldn't mind if Mole rats attacked your workshop more often, just not as the Event enemy.
---
I have the usual amount
---
Well I'm taking it easy xD I'm close, I keep lvling up with just 10% buff :p
---
Biggest issues I had as a Berserker was the Ballistic Gusty,Assaultrons and Super Mutants with Mini guns if they caught me off guard.
---
I never made use of broken armor, or level 1 wood armor with addictions personally.
---
It was just a matter of adapting and learning to play the build for me personally, Scorchbeast comes around? Jump in a Hazmat and have at it! Bare in mind though that I was of the heavy gunner variety.
---
That’s what I do I take anything I can I feel kinda shitty after tho
---
You're right. As I was focusing on the negative, review was a poor choice of words. 
---
However. Condescending? Derision?
---
So what? Did my criticism of an piece of entertainment you had nothing to do with hurt your feelings? Hope not. I was hard on OW. I expected better. 
---
The game got a blatant free pass on the We have Bethesda and Fallout Killer hype trains. 
---
OW was not a start to finish great game.  It was a pretty good game start to finish at best. At best. 
---
If you disagree, again, feel free to post why, instead of just essentially calling me mean. Let's discuss the reasons you disagree with my criticisms.....
---
I'll wait.
---
Fair point to that. But as other people commented before I did a little editing you can still wear broken armor and get perks from it. 
---
One guess would be like this. They could add in a weapon effect called unbreaking were the weapon won’t break but only does like half or a third of its damage or similar one were you don’t have to reload. They probably don’t want to cause they think Itd be to strong which to that I say we have the bloodied build which I’ve seen with the right guns take a quarter of the Queens health in a few seconds before. So yeah
---
[agitation intensifies]
---
Definitely, I thought it worked that way when I first played NW only to get quickly wrecked by a team! I'd happily play solo lobbies  as its usually just me vs a team of 3 in the end anyways
---
I don't think this is the case at all.
---
I've been playing this game for a couple weeks now and I already have a full set of Unyielding with Action Point Cost reduction, a full set of Vanguard with + stat, bloodied weapons out the ass, finished the main questline, unlocked the Plasma Caster with bullion, currently farming up reputation for some other blueprints...
---
I don't see anything wrong with the amount of progression you make in this game.  I'm like level 90 already, too.
---
I'm not entirely sure what progress you're all trying to achieve that requires a borderline infinite amount of time to make?
---
The only thing I really have left is reputation farming, some side quests if I want, and finding literally perfect rolled equipment that will make little to no tangible difference in my build.
---
This works. It's what I've done with pictures I've had to delete so far.
---
Why would I need duplicates? I rank up the ones that work for my playing style and then move on.  However there were a few times the card choosing screen didn’t show max level or whatever and I picked another that I didn’t need. 
---
I still would like to know if we need coins to destroy cards though
---
Close the game and relaunch it. Seems to be an issue only when I’ve switched between XBL accounts or let the game disconnect from the server due to inactivity and reconnected and started playing instead of relaunching the app.
---
As a precaution I always relaunch 76 fresh before I start playing.
---
With prime sabot rounds
---
Thank you I will!
---
Gold Bullion to buy the plans from the gold vault.
---
That unlocks the armor for crafting and general loot pool.
---
Legendary modules from Momma Murmrgh at the Rusty Pick if you want to craft grind the armor.
---
ill take perk card packs based on whats comin
---
That could be fixed with a simple graphics setting that would limit how many camp objects you can render at once
---
Those recipes are more of a cap sink so players don’t go over the 30k max. There’s more than enough ppl to get all the serums from for less than 400c each.
---
You can also use Hard Baragin perk to get more caps when selling. You still only get 1400 per day but you'll get there a bit faster. (If you don't have it, you can message your teammates and ask them to share this perk or even the travel agent perk, if you feel like it.) There's a tons of easy ways to earn quick caps, I'm sure others will suggest things. It's been so long since I had to worry about getting caps I can't really remember any good methods. I always just sold junk before scrapping it to get caps. Slow but works. One day you'll be at the point where you need to get rid of caps just to make room for more lol
---
They haven’t announced anything yet but Bethesda has a habit of porting over games cross generations so I wouldn’t be surprised if they do
---
Agree, but the more xp is situational.  If the attacker is Supers, I always defend.  If its Mole Rats I usually just let the place get overrun and take it back.
---
&gt;Everytime someone opens the map the game would have to pull the inventory list from ALL vendors currently on the servers.
---
A long time ago good programmers invented this thing called a cache. Look into it.
---
I think I read somewhere your interactions with them can be different if you have the Cannibal perk equipt.
---
Every single day. You can clean out the vendor bots for 1400 caps total.
---
They said the same thing about outer worlds
---
Why do you not have the perk card? Get it! 
---
Also move your camp down south east. Then you can use that and vault 76 more efficiently as free fast travel points.
---
I think you can also fast travel free to public team members camps, so take advantage of that.
---
If you're looking for caps, just go clear out the airport and drag all gear to the nearby station to sell.
---
Thanks will do before I dident even know you could sell stuff thank you all for ur comments
---
Cook all of the meat you find. Sell the excess to vendors before it spoils. Once you can build a water purifier you can sell excess water.
---
It’s exactly stuff like this that refines fallout series for me. 
---
The dark and twisted world where everyone just wants to survive. 
---
It was a lovely experience
---
They mention already it going to be backward with ps4 so don’t over think it and give ur ps4 away
---
Cool will do
---
I would just fill up trader slots with my heaviest items at 30K caps each. Would be a terrible idea to implement.
---
Uh... it’s the same exact amount
---
Also concrete is done... cork started yesterday
---
I’d take that too. Or add in a strength or endurance perk with the same effect cause there’s not one. Anything to make it a more viable build would be nice imo
---
You don't have to. I dont lol and I'm level 244.
---
Interesting! Thanks! I'll report back if this works for me.
---
They aren’t going instanced. You’ll be able to have an instanced section of your camp, giving you more options in your bunker.
---
Oh that might be true! Would make sense at least. 
---
I can imagine that path being hilarious as well
---
I don’t have the card because I never got it out of perk card packs
---
65 million cork now. Gee, who would have thought it was so plentiful in the game? Nope, absolutely no number-fudging at all. Call me a cynic, but I smell fresh ink.
---
I can only agree.
---
It's an exploit if you can conjure screws out of thin air. Kinda exploit. Or better yet "not intended to happen" when you do the whole helm thing.
---
You literally complain about how little time you often have for the game. And yet you complain that the game doesn't punish you for that.
---
How did I miss the point of your hypocrisy?
---
i do it for the brotherhood, not the rewards. Ad Victoriam!
---
I can't tell if the last sentence is sarcasm or not but regardless I will give it a try at some point when I'm bored.
---
Exactly. Same with ammo. 30k for one 5mm? Why not?
---
Thanks heaven, cant wait for it to come out on sunday
---
Yea but it helps tons so I’ll continue that I always leave like 3 plans I know so I feel less bad
---
The pros are that you can get a lot of resources while out in the map doing missions and you can get somewhat creative if you have a lot of resources. The cons is that you can lose all the constructions due to server disconnecting and any dude can hop in the workshop and kill you while you are cooking your radstag meat to claim the workshop or simply claim it while you are away. And, as we know, pvp is very messed up.
---
Oh man, I knew they were Cannibals from looking around so I just straight up slaughtered them.
---
Ok man, whatever.
---
But more freedom to build only......inside?
---
Can you pls tell me how to hit that carry weight on excavator? I have fusion cores I need to burn up.
---
It was changed, someone asked this exact question yesterday (Granted, High traffic means you probably haven’t seen it)
---
Awww
---
I'm not low lvl, tho that depends on your perspective what is low, and I buy serums from others especially if I see it cheap to use for myself, I'm sure a lot of players do the same, not to resell them..
---
Or just fix the system completely. Make some perks passive and enabled all the time. Make others "active" and swappable for different gear/loadouts. 
---
All crafting, hacking, picklock, etc should be passive.
---
I would like to also add - please give us a drinkable toilet for our CAMP as a water source!
---
It's a guaranteed 3\* Legendary, but most of us gets 1\* loot.
---
I normally don’t care about photo modes in games until this one, seeing my photos as the load screen got me super into it... until I hit the photo limit. Now it’s like pulling teeth. Desperately begging for an increase 🙏
---
I just noticed my plasma caster was doing about 97 damage, and then I took the grounded serum and waited an hour for negative effects to become active, and my pip boy still shows my plasma caster doing 97 damage so not sure if the negative effects are working
---
Agreed. The pipe revolver is a pretty solid gun with the addition of the suppressor. I have a junkies/ffr/fr version that is a monster gunslinger weapon.
---
I also want to address this Minecraft reference.
---
1 ) In Creative Mode, people are still generally using it to make progress by virtue of building things.
---
2 ) I'd argue that the main portion of the Minecraft community isn't playing it purely for Creative Mode.
---
Don't think it's that simple. There's absolutely no reason for several dozens of meat piles to destroy my fps but it does anyways. Got a pretty decent system and there's no way some weapons and food pieces being displayed would drop my fps so drastically unless it's some other problem kicking in
---
Wrong
---
I honestly only tried the whole armor bit when I wanted to *science it*. 
---
I went with the whole *If I'm naked under these here clothes I need the max damage I can get* bit so all my Berserker heavies are Primed and only my Gatling Gun has the explosive effect * my frakkin' BerE Mini shredded me more than anything else*
---
That should be as simple as just some words in code since you already know what you know.
---
I don’t see how this makes sense. How would unlimited space guarantee godroll weapons when there is a daily scrip limit? I think you meant to talk about the scrip limit.
---
Whatever man. I watched the dev conf where they discussed the why's and hows.   So you just keep believing whatever you want.
---
While were on the subject, here's a fun tidbit! Dr Seuss's first published illustrations are in "The Pocket Book of Boners"
---
This is me on Xbox.  I can't find Ultracite Calibrated Shocks anywhere.
---
But why should we have to do that? Why should we have to drop legendaries we would otherwise scrip and convert to literally anything else?
---
The one in “power armour”?
---
I go buy and learn all the plans I don't already know.
---
I mean it was sarcasm. But now I'm wondering myself.
---
Oh I still visit the camps, and am thankful for the ones like yours, but going into it expecting heads definitely helps the disappointment. Lol
---
Are you using aligned long barrel and hardened receiver?
---
Wait what? OP you greedy bastard some heads up would have been nice
---
yeah, why not just make 1 skin but applicable to all types of armor.. just make it harder to get.
---
me too, of my 683 cork. Bye-bye 250 cork for 1 Nukashine and I think one Bufftat
---
Could you request the item be tagged unscrapable?
---
That's true, or ultracite armor pieces xD
---
It better - make it like **Fallout 4** so they can only tunnel through *soil*.
---
People say this but you know you wouldn't. People would begin complaining about content drought and the Atom Store just bringing back old stuff again and again and nothing new. 
---
Plus what would fixes by Bethesda even look like? They often fix plenty of stuff and end up making them worse for the sake of removing exploits. They fixed Legendary Perks only to make them less user friendly, they fixed the double walls only to make building less creative, they removed scout armor masks, removed the one star legendary effect on the blood eagle mask, increased budget values for floor and roof pieces. 
---
Before we start asking for one thing over another could we make sure we know exactly what the one thing means and what "fixes" come with it.
---
I needs start screaming into the mic anytime I do a queen fight now and she landsAIM FOR HER BALLS I NAKED UNDER THIS HAZMAT SUIT. 
---
I feel like I’d get a few giggles cause just to avoid the 2 shot I get from her swipes I aim for her rear legs with my buzz blade and half to time I’m looking straight at her ass
---
I just want to select a new perk or rank up an existing perk every 50 levels. Let me keep my cards please!! I like trying new things and moving points around time to time.
---
Why do they have to over complicate this?
---
And here I thought people were just being nice by dropping clown suits in my camp...
---
I was just about to start a thread about how wonderful people are giving me free outfits...
---
E so is under a different developer called Zenimax online studios
---
I have Sofia wearing the oom equipment
---
Along with the hard bargain perk card. Take grape mentats and you get a little bit extra for the things you sell to vendor bots or the vendors at the raiders/settlers camps.
---
I just made a new character specifically for that, and used all of my 4 characters to dump plans, craft level specific weapons, and provide some ammo and aid for the new one. I'm turning the new character into a high intelligence and charisma to make it even easier to take advantage of all of the XP boosting foods/aid/perks in the game. 
---
If Seasons is going to be a recurring thing, and I decide to keep playing this dumb game, then I figure my noob character will be pretty useful.
---
It will effectively be a self contained bubble within the world. There's no NPC access, no large external viewing areas, limited player access. The result is that whilst you are inside you have far lower data overheads than if you stood in your outer camp as you don't have to constantly monitor the world and update. The resultant savings can be transferred to the building budget.
---
Of course there's always a downside. Because its a Silo behind a locked door you'll have to endure a loading screen. I also suspect some items won't be able to be bunkered to ensure every player still has a full camp base.
---
Yeah I’m out here shooting small frogs to trying to complete a tadpole quest and when the numbers aren’t changing for a small frog I keep wondering if there are even smaller frogs out there.
---
I'm just disappointed in the lie about fixing the game board c.a.m.p item.
---
Mine clips into the inside of a wall.
---
So much for that fix
---
OMG, I would die from laughing alone!
---
Ok what about orange I don’t have grape
---
I can see them having a bunker that goes into a big cave or something.
---
Build 4-5 large water purifiers and sell the water using Hard Bargain
---
"Is there any expectation of new quest lines and story content?"
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/
---
it would've been great if we could use that armor skin in NW otherwise it's useless and honestly doesn't look well, that's true. NW is the only way to make them useful but it doesn't work in NW, the irony
---
Cool, haven't tried this combo yet! Thanks!
---
There 7 or 8 actual items that can spawn in different locations but only 5 are used per event, so it could have been there, just no one checked the right spot.
---
I still don't understand instanced interiors. Are other people going to be able to access them? Is this just another loading screen? I don't need a separate place to build if I'm the only one who's going to see it.
---
I bought the last 13 levels because i was past tired of it.
---
They didn’t say they were being replaced. They also said they are experimenting with increasing relaxing build restrictions. They didn’t say straight up no budget.
---
No point in engaging further. You've got your mind made up, and anyone who disagrees is wrong. Pointless to continue.
---
It is a Microsoft Owned title in that Microsoft owns the company, and it was believed any future titles from them would be Xbox Exclusives, but now obviously xbox has no more Exclusives which is great.
---
Awww.
---
I had 8, like normal.
---
This was actually how I farmed circuits. Glad I got a good stock in before they nerfed it.
---
WHAT?  who said anything about being replaced?   If you dont' know how instancing works, just stop talking.
---
I believe they will release 76 on next gen and probably ask full price for it. If GTA Online is anything to go by it'll probably be the only way to get the new updates as well when it moves over.
---
Im still waiting for my ultracite targeting hud ...
---
A ghillie skin bundle at level 80 would have been much more exciting
---
It's a "rain water collector". That means it's supposed to only collect water when it rains. Just slap down a water pump or the LR sink.
---
OP said he's on PC, but if you still have them, I'm willing to buy them for 1k.
---
"All I wanted was to enjoy reading my book. But this damned game drafted me to this raid"
---
Level 35 and only 300 caps
---
RIP 😔
---
For real!! Where was the post letting us know about this exploit that's not an exploit? 😤 I need screws too damnit
---
People have been doing this since launch of the game. And it has been talked about here in this sub gazillion times.
---
No, I get that, I know. I meant that was likely the logic behind not doing an armor set for it. I really doubt that the “broken armor” was intentional, let alone considered to be a buff to one specific build.
---
Of course there’s isn’t. Your whole point is based on the idea there are posts being deleted we never know about. Which isn’t how the forums work. 
---
So why should I say anything more than awww when that’s your argument? It’s based on a premise that is flawed.
---
exactly, same with onslaught skins, there are a lot of types of armour I don't even use and never did, why not just make 1 universal skin but closer to  the end.
---
This happens to me a lot. Instead of leaving the world, I teleport far enough that there is a long loading screen then teleport back. If I teleport to a location too close to where I died, I'll still be in the bugged state. I don't know the cause.
---
Well I picked all the "nice" options in the dialogue and after asking her to come to the raid with me, she claimed I was mean. Gail also said she liked me even though Ra-Ra hated me. She unlocked the power armor helmet for so I don't know if it was a bug and I'm gonna get screwed over during the heist but I'm about to do the raid so I'll find out.
---
So then making two guns for the cost of one isn't somehow the same thing?
---
Buy low level stuff, make serums give a new character the beginning in life you never had.
---
Yup bro gotta work 2 jobs to pay for the bills in my camp it’s a hard life🙁(Yarr this be a joke me boy)
---
&gt;Camps are going instanced
---
You are saying current camps are being replaced with instanced versions of the camps. That is incorrect.
---
Had a two shot Fatman. Threw on the perks for a whopping 5,800 dmg. Crafted 20 mini nukes out of boredom and went to a fissure site.
---
Direct hit on lvl 50 sb. 18 dmg. Gotta love bethesda
---
I always assumed it was due to me not giving them personal space and it was their silent protest that me, standing right next to them was not wanted.
---
I did that too and later traded for a set.
---
Think orange ones help with VATs. Whenever I’m at a player vendor and they have grape on cheap and buy as many as I can.
---
When first starting off I use to run melee build so had low maintenance and didn’t have to bother with ammo etc this then enable me to sell everything I found to bot vendors.  I was also able to sell ammo I found at my camp vendor as I didn’t need them.
---
Completing all daily missions on your pip boy gives caps as rewards too.
---
You will have an exterior for the world to see... but then there will be a door (simplifying) just like when you go to the overseer or wayard or, etc...  When you go inside, it will load.   This prevents having to have all the objects of the camp load in the overworld, and allows a much more robust limit and creativity.
---
Keep an eye out for a 90% reduced weight 10mm and slap a recon scope on it.
---
Here for the wrapped cap moral support club also ...  I just want it to work with any face mask
---
This pandemic truly affects everyone
---
Bethesda, forget these kind of kind of posts. We need functional bug fixes not cosmetic ones.
---
I'm not on at the moment so I dont have specific numbers but:
---
Max strength with marsupial in excavator with calibrated shocks and motion assist servos should put you at around 455 on it's own.  This is basically where I live in the game.
---
I run carnivore, so deathclaw steak give 4 strength for about 20 points and pepperoni rolls give another 60 to bring that up to 535.  From there, if you need to go higher, strange in numbers should give you another 5 points, Buffout another 10 for 550.  
---
On the rarer end, a strength bobble head with add 1 strength for 5 weight, and grognak 9 (I think that's it) adds 10 weight for the last 15.
---
565 for a few minutes, 535 for a half hour, and 455 permanently.
---
This is the most reasonable explanation
---
So take it when you level up, you can pick any card you are high enough level for it doesn't have to be one from the special stat you choose to raise.
---
ok now i feel like a damn clown, i have never paid attention to that before. thank you for the info. are you able to remove a rank from a perk card or no?
---
Nice! I'll try this technique out! Thanks!
---
Do not pay more than 150 for a non legendary fixer
---
No it's not. Since the helmet thing would give you unlimited amount of screws when you don't even need to use them to craft the helmet. If you had the time to sit and spam buttons. Making guns only gives steel and maybe wood and something, and the amounts will be less than what you uses to craft the guns.
---
And if that was my point, you might actually sound coherent.
---
Yeah, always feel awkward when they're talking to some other NPC yelling at them but still staring at you, I'm like, I didn't do anything, just stop!
---
Some of those don’t look hacked or am I missing something? What’s wrong with that bloodied bow for example?
---
Edit: fire rate I assume
---
...at least get rid of the area search, and replace it with a waypoint for each mob.
---
Yea bro can’t go outside and my 1200 caps stimulus check ain’t come yet maybe it’s cuz I don’t got a mail box 🧐
---
WOW... your mind jumps to conclusions and assumptions in heartbeat.  I NEVER used the word replaced.  I didn't want to have to write a paragraph to explain to the simple-minded.   You will still have an external camp.. then there will be a "Door" where you go in to an instanced part... 
---
You really need to work on your need to jump to criticism, because your lack of comprehension is astounding.
---
I just tried out fo76 with some friends for the first time since they fixed the unlimited weight carry bug. Besides the numerous bugs and crashes, the game is still an inventory management simulator and it's annoying as fuck.
---
Ok I know
---
Even if it was a buff it’s a bad one. The best you can do is get your whole set with the prefixes like zealots and trouble shooter endurance and anything to reduce weight on your held items.
---
They need to consider ether doing an effect to boost you survival rates or doing some new perks that fall under strength and endurance that all work like Zerker does
---
&gt;Let me preface this with I KNOW THIS WONT EVER HAPPEN.
---
Yeah. Sadly we all know.
---
Wouldn't it be nice if Bethesda was the kind of company that cared about the quality of their product, their reputation as a world leading gaming industry titan and cared about doing their best for the player base, all to foster long term growth.
---
Same preface applies.
---
Because they hand out legendary weapons like peanuts and due to the roll system 99.9% of them are worthless. So you drop them and move on because they have no use to you.  And once you get the 00.1% good drop that is useful 100% of them become worthless.   
---
They are so inherently worthless it was almost if not an entire year since I started playing before I finally got a legendary gear that I actually would use.  I was running pure standard crafted myself armor and weapons for a year without any issue.  And the only reason I even still vaugly give a shit about legendaries or script is because I'm still waiting for my ideal roll of an  AA, 10% bonus damage while aiming with 90% weight reduced hand made and gauss rifle.  But even then the current weapons I have are more then fine and it is more just an ideal set for me.
---
The only way I've found to get that weapon to be great is in third person using VATS. 
---
Charge First, VATS, then fire. 
---
 It seems super picky about unleashing the 'devastating attack' that is advertised in the description. I can usually get it to deploy that attack so long as I've got at least 16%-95% VATS, but if it registers 20% and there's a blade of grass in the way, you get the 'Warm Breeze' attack from the weapon.
---
In my experience this is an issue mainly in the Forest and probably to an extent in the Savage Divide. I have my CAMP in the Mire and my login routine consists of claiming Dabney homestead and it's not boring I'll tell you that much. In the Forest the waves themselves seem to be divided into smaller waves of spawning enemies, but in the Mire the entire wave spawns at once and heads straight to the Workshop, so it's gonna be about 8-10 Anglers/Super Mutants/Crickets etc. etc.
---
But yeah, I'm never doing Defend events outside of the higher level areas, because they're so fucking tedious.
---
OMG, YES .. I never said the external part was going away.   If you don't know how it works, do some reading.   Camps are going instanced.. doesnt' mean that 100% exterior camp is gone... what are you going to have Just a door in the middle of nowhere, come on, use common sense.
---
PC Master Race for you. People will hack shit just because they can.
---
What I do is until I get to 50 I'll scrip everything everyday but not redeem any. Once I start hiting a 1000 scrip I'll only redeem enough to keep me under 1000. That way you're still getting a few items to help along the way but once you finally hit 45-50 you can dump all 1000 into potentially good gear.
---
BoS will bring an introductory questline. Steel Dawn will introduce us to this version of the brotherhood as well as lead into whatever they can here to do. Fractured Steel will probably see whatever we did in Dawn lead to a divide between the BoS. 
---
A break may be a good choice just for the sake of having more when you return, but if everything stay on track we could see the BoS questline start in a few weeks. So not that long.
---
Like Deathspriest said though. ESO is being developed by Zenimax, who has their entire studio on that project. Bethesda has bits of different teams allocated to this while they maintain 3 mobile games, 2 future projects, and run programs like the creation club for F4 and Skyrim. And we can assume there’s still people spitballing other future projects. They’re definitely understaffed.
---
Now sink it!
---
It's your responsibility to get your point across. You're point is this. If they weren't doing their job, the forums would be more of a mess.
---
Which implies they are busy removing posts that violate the rules on their own. Only many people aren't seeing that happening. 
---
So again, what is your point? Because you are kind of backing my point up. The forum is a mess wtih the kind of posts I'm talking about.
---
"WEEK OF" - does not mean that exact date. Could be anywhere from Aug 16 - Aug 22.
---
They're not glitched, every single one of those is hacked. A user intentionally downloaded or created a third-party program and used it to knowingly create something that shouldn't exist. As for why they can't remove something as blatant as those abominations, only bethesda can answer that. I already saw some level 400+ clown earlier today at scorched earth with the good old beam splitter .50 cal, submitted my report with a screenshot but I know it's crying in the rain when they unbanned people just like that only a few weeks ago.
---
If you want to fly around with your fucked up god toys, go play fallout 4 ffs. No player whose opinion matters wants that shit here
---
I'll do it on the second and third if there's lots of people standing around not doing anything for the non-legendary miners but they all converge on the first and I don't get a hit.
---
Yeah, well, that's just, like, your opinion, man.
---
K
---
I love when a nuke completes that daily for me.
---
Sunday is not a guaranteed date.
---
Well, if that’s what you think, you’re free to think that. I just want more chances at the purveyor, seeing as the odds of getting the weapon I want is ~1/55000.
---
Thanks. I lived in my Excavator back in the day when if you logged in wearing it you got a plus 200 carry weight bonus. I only crack it out now to crawl thru Lucky Hole on lead ore round ups, and since I got the ammo machine from the Raiders I haven’t been back to Lucky Hole in a while.
---
Do you still need a fixer?
---
It's fucking faster to throw them than to click the stupid confirmation to drop every single grenade
---
"Whats preventing the deletion of all these?" incompetence of bughesda.
---
Well you should have said they were adding a new instancing feature to camps versus “going” instanced. Going is  Synonymous with transformed. Sorry for the misunderstanding. My comprehension is just fine. You should try using correct language if you don’t want to be misunderstood. 
---
When you say they are “going instanced”, people who speak English natively will interpret That as “will now be instanced” or “are becoming instanced”, neither of which is accurate.
---
I don't think it was added to Atom shop yet.
---
Yup. I've just stopped playing because of the tedium. Don't even care if I finish the legendary run or not.
---
Why on earth would I debate your opinions? I already told you you are entitled to them and you are clearly entrenched. I am glad you agree you were being a a dick though.
---
main reason i stopped playing is garbage FPS everywhere and anywhere given the acception of small interior cells idk why but 8gb vram and octocore CPU, 24gbRAM ive been through the .ini files and changed RADEON graphic settings but never have a consistent frame rate.
---
my avg fps traveling around toxic valley is 20+ which is a
---
FOMO has to be fading by now, yeah? Playing since the fake beta, I've noticed that even most of the bundles come back on deep discount after 45-60 days or so. Having FO1ST, I thought it was great buying one of the bundles with the "allowance", but waiting a month or so started a cycle where there's usually an older bundle on sale, instead. Buying a bundle like that is deeply satisfying (as was the Excavator PA coal dust paint for about a buck fifty, recently).
---
The one free thing I really want to see return is the wooden modern art sculpture. I don't know how I missed it, but I'd sure like to have it.
---
Banner hasn’t been added to atomic shop yet. We all get it though.
---
That's why I put it under discussion. Seeing if anyone else felt the same
---
But no rifle in FO76 (usually based on RL models) is a designated 'anti material rifle' per se.  You just slap on the perk card tank killer and turn \*every\* weapon with a stock - even laser and plasma weapons - into a 'tank killer' with AP capabilities. 
---
That's perfectly fine because it is a game, could be done with pistols/shotguns too with another perk name if you like. And there is no need to remind you of RL shotguns and pistols with that capability, because... (to quote you): wait for it - it is a game.
---
ok, so question, seeing as how this post is the one my attention is on and i suck at trolling through to find a specific post.
---
anyways, so did they just nerf super duper on the assaultatron helmets, or all clothing items/weapons/etc.
---
i ask because one of my breads and butters in my vendors is treasure hunter outfits and hats.  would make my life a little easier if i don't have to remember to equip super duper, shame though i wouldn't get any more free ones.
---
Thanks for the clarification!
---
No we don't.
---
Saying camps are going instanced, is actually saying that. It might not be what you meant. But there's nothing in it that says instanced is additional.
---
An overreaction to say the least.  The examples you provided have nothing to do with casual interest in a video game or console.  Correlation does not equal causation.  
---
I appreciate your effort, but what a reach.
---
Me and gf try get a hit in and try let others get it when we feel generous. Other times we one shot it.
---
But I notice a lot of high levels dick around. Doing nothing. Waiting only for legendaries. Not fixing the broken machines etc.  So we one shot them at that situation.  Why reward uselessness?
---
Yes... they’ve clearly stated new quests and story are coming.
---
You sure you have the combat rifle mods and not talking about the combat shotgun mods?
---
Obviously you are not a golfer.
---
But it's still not an exploit it's a perk. Perhaps they should have kept it in mind when they thought about what materials are required to make them.
---
Change what is required to make the item.
---
"When you craft anything, there is a 30% chance you'll get double results"
---
Seems if that doesn't apply to some items they should change the cards text so it's accurate
---
I got a two shot fatman during fasnacht and would collect all of the mini-nukes the suiciders dropped.  Didn't do much but it was fun.
---
No I shouldn't.  Educate yourself on the instanced camps... Nobody in a conversation INCLUDING THE DEVS from their conference where they referenced as "Instanced Camps".   They didn't constantly state "Camps with partial outside and inside".... use your brain, read a little, understand what instancing has.. and then use common sense, instead of looking for made up reasons to attack people.
---
I would have known if it was. And if it was so widespread, Bethesda would have patched it decades ago cause they don't want us profiting. So people kept it to themselves... bastards
---
Honestly, they could keep the .44 as is and just add the service revolver as a new weapon.
---
I think packing light should stay as agility, though. If it moved to perception, then rifle/pistol users couldn’t have concentrated fire and packing light if they want tank killer.
---
The rest of these are nice changes, especially because rifles have been sorely needing a weight reduction perk. I’ve spent time playing almost every weapon type in the game (excluding guerrilla and two handed), and right now, pistols are one of the hardest to play because of their lack of armor penetration, which in turn requires them to use critics hits.
---
"Getting a point across" is contingent on the second party being capable of comprehension. Since that has been proven to be an exercise in futility in this scenario, I fail to see how any additional effort is worthwhile.
---
I doubt they will due to it being part of the main quest and all, same with Camp Venture, tho i wouldn't be surprised if we got a scout npc there or something.
---
its exactly worth it because you get more atoms than if you straight up bought atoms.. and then the rest of it on top..
---
a player doesnt have to like it.. or use it even.. but it is no question.. a good value if theyre spending money anyway
---
They changed this to all cards give 1 peek coin on the Pts, so we don't know whether that will be a permanent change or not
---
I remember being at 555 baseline.  Those were the days.  I lost my calibrated mods off the legs when they patched that.  Had to re mod them.
---
Also eso has a lot more to pull from for content vs fallout 76
---
Agreed. If they had this for auto rifles as well, it’d be nice, and then every ranged weapon class within reason has a guass version.
---
No it isn't.. that is YOUR comprehension. I used the same terminology the devs did in their conference.  They are going instanced..doesn't mean no more camps in the outside world.. come on man.  
---
I dont' have to a detailed paragraphs EVERY time we reference instanced camps.  It's understood, since Beth themselves do this and anyone understanding or following instanced housing knows EXACTLY this.
---
Public team, hard bargain, grape mentats (while selling to a vendor)
---
what I do is collect glowing meat and glowing blood or super stims ... cook the meat with super duper and sell all the meat blood and such to a robot vendor.
---
good place to farm shotgun ammo and glowing meat is the uranium fever event then when it ends I loot everything I can waddle over to the white springs station and sell it all. 
---
There’s a ton of stuff you can farm in Blackwater mine and get your caps limit easily
---
It’s arbitrary but I consider anyone over 100 to be a “higher level player”.
---
Okay, thanks a lot for the update, didn't mean to spread wrong information, it was just what I had heard and seen in videos as I haven't downloaded the PTS myself
---
I know why an instanced camp is lol. 
---
Anyway you are really taking this into an uncivil direction so I am going to leave. Your comment was not clear. I tried to give a little constructive feedback. I did not attack you. Have a nice day.
---
I got the key card thank you so much and thanks to everyone who left a comment
---
Are legendary perks in game yet? Last I knew they were on the PTS but not in the main game.
---
Yes! I haven't had any luck yet.
---
Thank you for the reply. Really appreciate it :D
---
This is entirely on you. Bethesda made it clear on launch what you got for your money.
---
Yes, they also said that they had plans to do all that other stuff like the persistent private worlds but it was clear that they didn't specify a timeline and it's not like Bethesda's been hiding how poor they are on delivering promised features.
---
At least it's good that you've put your money where your mouth is an have cancelled. Hopefully with enough cancellations Bethesda might pay attention and actually try to fulfil some of these promised features to draw people like you back in.
---
And that number is so low you shouldn't really give a shit about getting it at all. Even if the script was removed you could spend a year playing 8 hours a day minimum and still not get the specific roll you want. So giving anything more then 1/10th of a shit makes no sense to me.
---
Well if they did that they could also make it so you can't just access your shop items directly from stash, so that'd prevent people using it as a on-the-go inventory, plus shops have a limited number of slots so you'd just be wasting shop space with heavy items.
---
I never said casual, I said entitled assholes.
---
&gt;It's way less tedious than grinding Westek for a few hours
---
For sure!  But that doesn't make this a good daily "challenge".
---
I still don't see anything wrong with people buying your stuff no matter the level. For example I can't craft serums yet, so I buy them and some people don't even bother with recipes because it's easier to buy a cheap serum. I don't approve reselling, but if it happens it's on that person's conscious.
---
I can make you a level 40 and a 50 for free
---
I beg you pardon?
---
I suspect it's a combination of many reasons. Some have to do with the way the game itself is structured regarding weapon mods. Some have to do with the infamous "tool limitations" available to whoever does enforcement. Some has to do with personnel numbers and the associated budget. And some has to do with Bethesda's leniency and overall soft enforcement of their TOS. In short, to truly combat illegitimate spawns and dupes would take time and money that Bethesda does not want to spend because they are already spending those resources somewhere else.
---
The best you can do is screenshot/record and submit evidence at https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10/?prod=1129&amp;cat=28
---
I think it's dumb that ammo itself weights anything when in the stash, you grind for that stuff and then suddenly has to throw it away since it's taking up so much space.
---
I've been playing the game from the launch, and using this sub from the first week of the game. It has been discussed here multiple times. Nothing has been "kept it to themselves". You just never saw it.
---
All the devs have said is that it’s a door that goes in your camp, which will lead to an instanced interior that would reduce the concerns of build limits. 
---
They have not stated if it’s an underground bunker or if it’s a doorway into your actual above-ground build. It’s just been a lot of speculation beyond that. “Shelter “seems to suggest underground like a fallout shelter, but they also said this was meant to give the building community more room to design, which would only really be helpful if we had the build limit for a nice interior and exterior. 
---
For now, no one but the devs know the mechanics of this update!
---
You do not lose duplicate cards
---
Then I don't see how this is an issue with C.A.M.P.s, if some meat piles gets your FPS to tank then it's an issue with your PC, if we follow that logic we couldn't have much of anything.
---
Do we really lose cards? I thought card packs gave us the cards that we don't have or for something we didn't max out
---
Are you sure you don't have both and just need to select "more" or "other" on the gift emote in the emote wheel? I didn't discover that until *way* later when I thought I was missing an old one, too.
---
Ok also I have a little advice u probably don’t need but foundation has tons of junk and you can get like 50 springs and screws I just rlly wanted to say this for someone
---
Thanks, well the third one really becomes an issue, specially when the game is poorly translated to another language xD.
---
Yup, someone one shot a mole miner on me last night and gave me the sorry emote.  So I returned the favor...
---
&gt; brotherhood troops and turrets
---
You mean XP thiefs?
---
Haha, true, but it’s one we’re unfortunately stuck with. And doing it with new characters is very very easy and quick
---
dogmeat hasnt been born yet
---
At the mega Red Rocket up north I had a ghoul spawn in a wall. No way to get to him. Fun.
---
Very cool indeed.
---
Yes please! That would be amazing.
---
Finally, someone with the guts to help
---
Restoring characters or setting stuff up to fix something caused by a glitch, is a different scenario than giving back a single item to some random who scrapped it. It's his damn fault he scrapped it, so why should they give it back to him?
---
Okay, what's your GT, I'll have them in 5 minutes
---
you'd think that with how enormous the mole miner gauntlet looks on normal characters, it'd be able to mount onto power armor.  also, how come we don't have any mole miners that became fused into excavator suits and run around thrashing people in them?
---
Even with my high intelligence character, it very much is. I don’t use unyielding (or, not actively - I have two pieces of it, but I stay at full health since I’m using solar), but I do have egg head and casual under armor. Even with a herbivore boosted cranberry relish, the going is so slow I had to pop four lunchboxes to get done at a decent time yesterday.
---
Thanks.
---
The game has gotten much better since the release, but I'd expect their databases to be able to handle this kind of stuff specially when they are using AWS
---
It feels like theyve already spent 6 months of zero content
---
Join a public team, that way you can fast travel for free to your teammates, their camp, or their tent (if they have fo1st)
---
You don’t need to always fast travel there. Walk or run there. That way on your way there you can kill enemies, look junk, some enemies even have caps when you kill them. Pick up their weapons even if it’s trash just so you can sell them at a train station. 
---
Unless you have really good legendary weapons and armor which I doubt since you’re not level 50 and up. I wouldn’t really bother with selling stuff to other players. And if you do, definitely don’t be that person that thinks they can sell a 1 star gun for 3,000-4,000 caps. 
---
Do missions. Loot enemies. Sell their weapons. Each day you can sell 1,400 caps worth of junk weapons and food to the robots at the train station. 
---
Meaning each day you have the option to get 1,400 caps. Plus whatever caps you get from looting enemies and completing events.
---
I agree. They have spent way to much time pretending that nothing is wrong and just ignoring the major in-game issues. That now because over the last to years they loaded bugs on top of bugs on top of bugs that are dependent on those bugs. That they can't fix anything now without breaking something else. Now they have to find more money to pay people to come in and try to sort things out because everyone got paid for two years to do nothing about the bugs.
---
What, they went down the shitter because they don't want to give an item back to some dumbass who scrapped it? You scrapped it, you take responsibility for that. Back when people lost characters due to their account being compromised support solved those issues for them. But this? This should have never been a support ticket because it's not a fucking issue.
---
Oops sorry i thought he meant 16 august.
---
But he is different in every fallout he's just called dogmeat just called dogmeat.
---
No it's an issue with many people. Started happening since latest patch. Obviously an issue with the game. And that is exactly the reason why we don't get much of anything. Ever wonder why we are limited to 800 pounds of stash limit in the first place?
---
Yup... the 1* Nocturnal emitting BONE club...
---
Tool Limitations are the replies you get from GMs. They can only work with the toolsets they are given. Devs can fix this on their end, but given how routinely they botch even the simplest of things, i think we could all hazard a pretty fair guess at how disastrous it would be if they tried.
---
Thanks for the detailed response! Good to know strong back works, but yeah I havent heard anything good regarding damage output. I'll just have to test it myself I guess when I get to that point.
---
If it really comes down to it I may just have to wear the stealth suit for rad resist so I can use my normal gauntlets and hope I can get to a good survivable defensive combined with barbarian, evasive, ironclad, blocker, ricochet, and maybe even some refractor.
---
Fast hp regen &amp; fast “recharge” of AP. Best to use with perk COLA NUT
---
Iron Ore + Super Duper
---
This has increased for me since the last patch. Creatures spawning buried in the ground, inside building walls or areas we can’t get to. 
---
Eventually it resolves itself and the turrets can somehow see and eliminate the threat, but very frustrating for the man involved.
---
Yeah, maybe I should do these easy ones.
---
For veteran players, sure the FOMO shouldn't be as bad. Some people are just wired that way, however. I dont really mean that as a criticism, people are allowed to play the way they want. And if they keep purchasing atoms, it keeps the game afloat which benefits all of us who enjoy it.
---
Nice, r/fo76 starting to really go down the drain downvoting someone for saying the fucking truth. If you scrap an item then that's your own damn fault, take the responsibility for it.
---
Seven Gun quota
---
They will autocomplete another free 140,000,000 like the concrete. Totally hysterical. Shows lack of communication between players and devs that they ever thought their original number was obtainable.
---
Not really though. For example, Glowing Mass is pretty heavy. You would only need 1 trader slot to stack tons of Glowing Mass and it isn't something you need to access regularly, so accessing it in camp is not a problem. Or, fusion cores that stack, or any other stackable item that is heavy. It is free to fast travel back to camp, and most people are doing so regularly to dump junk (or at least they should be). And those 1 or two slots in the trader are hardly a problem. Oh no, I can't list a plan that everyone already knows and is never going to buy.
---
Agreed, good sir, definitely agreed!
---
Well, I can’t say anything about it being slow, because that does suck, but at least it doesn’t irradiated you. Also - how big is the internal inventory? If it’s at least one pound, it should hold at least 2, since I believe the machines will go slightly over capacity if there’s space left.
---
I consider myself very lucky because I don't play NW (not even for the rewards)  and have experienced the fast travel bug only once since wastelanders. As long as they keep the duplication glitches fixed, I am somewhat happy. 
---
But 6 months no new content is just a little bit too much.
---
Thanks for the advice and also I have level 50 weapons and 2 legendary light machine guns so yea I have some good level 50 legendary weapons
---
I doubt it. The interface is just like your stash
---
My dude, this should be background content not THE content.
---
Ohhh!! hahah I totally overlooked that, now it makes sense
---
OPs post is about having different opinions than their friends.  Not about celebrities being threatened by over zealous fans or an unhinged mentally ill person losing it in game chat.  So your reply is a sensationalist overreaction.
---
I’ve red in comments that players spamming N.Cola but how could I put it to quick access? I’m on PS4
---
Is it possible to replace stimpack?
---
Well they weren't vocal enough. It's patched anyways so it doesn't matter
---
I cry at the amount of other mats used if that is accurate to the T
---
Lol yup. I kept shooting them directly up and seeing where it falls during that event.
---
You could always reserve the stealth suit for rad zones and use actual armor elsewhere.  I mean, if you build for stealth, the enemies should not be too much of an issue in there attack ability.  After all, cant hit what you cant see.
---
Haha that would be hilarious honestly
---
A. You scrapping them is your fault. Not theirs. They don't have any obligation to return an item, that the player has willfully removed due to his/her own lack of attention while using an in-game feature.  
---
B. The missing item section is most likely for items that were not delivered after a quest should have rewarded them for example.  
---
C. Idk why they told you something about tool limitations instead of just telling you that They are not obliged to spawn items for players who have lost them in a legitimate way and not a bug/compromised account.
---
Bethesda: What's that? You want more NW Quests, well okay then. 
---
"Unlock 3 crates to find melee weapons, kill 3 players with the melee weapon you find and use their stimpack to spend 1 minute in the storm" 0/3 
---
Enjoy! And don't forget the cool new stuff we put in the Atom Shop! New skins for the Lead Pipe!
---
My problem is that they can pop up anywhere. 
---
Run to where it is hiding behind the bleachers? POP! Now it’s right at your workbench behind that forklift. 
---
Run around that forklift, POP, over in the lake. 
---
Ugh.
---
True, But solar is survival energy. It is the first thing I think of. Managing and living near nuclear power plants is problematic without properly trained personal and proper maintenance.
---
If you really want to help some folks, you could go around to any player who is less than level 50 and just buy our their shops, then drop any of the stuff you don't want. It would allow some caps to flow downhill to those who need it (probably). And you could skip obvious bot accounts with those usernames that are all alphanumeric mess. 
---
I mean, that's REALLY altruistic though, so, do what you want.
---
Look at how we all anticipated the ammo converter, I am sure Bethesda will implement the perk loadouts in this way:
---
To quickly change perk loadouts, first you have to hit go to the main menu, then to the newly designed intuitive perk loadout screen, read and press 3 confirmation screens, choose the perk loadout you previously saved and hit confirm again...
---
... then you are done with the Strength Perk Loadout, you will just have to repeat it for the rest such as Int etc.
---
Favorites circle
---
You figured out my evil plan  with this one, damn it
---
Exactly.  Why should we be nice if people do the exact same to others?
---
The other day a guy sent me hateful messages for taking a legendary.
---
So I said " don't lie, you've done it too" he never responded.
---
Guilty.
---
Many low lvl items are really valuable, not bloodied though.
---
Ikr? Some sort of PA-sized gauntlet would be sweet. A big excavator scoop, jackhammer, or upscaled bladed miner gauntlet. Or even something crazy like 5 deathclaws welded on your arm.
---
I won't deny that the game's buggy but there's nothing I've encountered in 2000+ hours that's been game breaking for me. Guess I've been lucky, I also didn't start until 10 months after its release.
---
Okay good. It might just be me, but I won’t ever buy any weapons unless they are level 45 and up. 
---
Now that you have some legendary weapons, try to figure out if they are good weapons people want, or if they aren’t that popular but could still sell for a decent amount. 
---
Obviously it’s your store so you can sell it for whatever you want. But the higher you ask, the less you’ll sell. Not always. If it’s a really good legendary 3 star weapon that I need, I’ll happily pay 10,000-15,000 caps. But if it’s just a basic legendary weapon that can be replaced by something else. I usually don’t pay more than 500
---
I mean the challenge on Monday was "Take a photo in NW". Was a no brainier.
---
It looks like very long way) tap-tap-tap....dead😂
---
How can I honestly reply without using the word snowflake? I give up, I can't.
---
Lag is an issue, and the game chugs and conks out at the worst times! Specially since the last patch servers rarely go past 20fps anymore!
---
And they've gone down the shitter because they don't help with any support issue anymore, not even the loss of score due to their challenges glitching out! Or quests locking out and being impossible to complete. They just don't help at all anymore!
---
Awesome! I'd love to get more data on this one so keep me in the loop lol
---
Agreed. And I'm all for keeping the game afloat as long as the financial burden is more evenly distributed away from the builders. People wanting to primarily play by building like in FO4 (myself, admittedly) generally have to wait the longest or pay the most to play the game that way.
---
You are right extremely annoying when the last enemy is stuck in a wall and you cannot kill it, so therefore you cannot build anything.
---
I always wait until it says retake the workshop, that way you have one wave instead of 3.
---
OP was mulling over the reasons why people were getting angry at them for their preferences, and I was agreeing. The death threats were just a footnote to express how crazy entitled people get over these things- the only reason I expressed further was because you asked. 
---
Because yeah, it's a common reaction- no matter how dramatic.
---
It's not the literal name that's the issue - it's the flavour of it.
---
There are no armour piercing shotguns that fire shot rounds. It's not a thing. So having an armour piercing perk for shotguns makes zero sense.
---
Don't get me wrong, there are balance issues that do need to be addressed. Shotguns and pistols do need work. I'm just saying it should make sense for the weapon and a tank killer effect, especially for shotguns but to some extent pistols as well, makes no sense to me at all.
---
I mean if you're going to do that, why not have pistols shoot 8 shots spread out in a cone or have a shotgun with the range and efficacy of a sniper rifle. I mean if you're going to make every weapon the same as every other one anyhow, why not, right...? smh
---
Is there a chance you could share that video? Instances of the game not saving your inventory are useful knowledge to have. Junk lost on death left after you've died and the game dc'd you is a feature, not a bug.
---
Yes I agree that they need to change the workshop capture and defend mechanics.
---
I hate having to look for the last guy, should be able to capture with full spawn. Once the timer starts everything should come running at u and whatever can’t will lose to the timer.
---
Same for defending, a set timer of 10min or so should start and you can succeed even if hiding the whole time just the enemies won’t go away until you leave the area or kill them. 
---
Glad people still care about workshops, I love building and want these to be improved in game.
---
I would love it if the twist with this brotherhood guy is just that he's a conman and just fucks off with all our shit.
---
Exactly.  I was also doing one violent night..last evening... and the other high level big guns were sitting on the roof cherry picking while two of us were multitasking, playing instruments/protecting the jukebox.  As soon as that bar filled I ran outside, charged the legendary, and that was that.  I knew that was the only reason they were there lol
---
"Level Up in NW"
---
Dude I know is like level 90 in NW. That alone would take him hours to level.
---
Check the range
---
I’m pretty sure one of them is bloodied Idk since there not my level I usually don’t look at them in my stash box but one of them is 3 star the other is 2 star
---
Yea thats why i said I only the damage cards get moved to perception.  Keep the rest in agility
---
\*Starts to set up Triangulation relays around Grafton Damn for the Kovac-Muldoon Platform\*
---
I do this with plans sometimes when I know the player is a low level. 
---
I also have a “Free Corner” in my camp where I put similar items I don’t want for other players to come and take.
---
Right?! Outside of the perimeter of Billings, in the lake, under the water, where you can't see them at all. Then suddenly, a diamond appears over the water! Oh, but you can't shoot them from outside the water. No, you have to dive in and kill them while also underwater. So frustrating.
---
Supposedly some have hidden effects too. Others do insane damage for no reason (not reflected in the weapon stats) or have no durability loss, use the wrong type of ammo, et al.
---
Wait for the reclamation event then they're usually grouped all together I find and it's a lot more chaotic and fun in any event
---
Could be a bug, I assume you've restarted a few times?
---
Or you have hud opacity turned down
---
I do enjoy the game still. I think implying there's nothing left to enjoy after the run is silly.
---
Sorry, I'm on PC, so to use something on the favorites wheel, I just hit the number on the keyboard. I'm not familiar with how to access the wheel on a controller.
---
I play on the Windows Store version, seems like it's more "refined". Anyway that sucks, you'd expect more stability since they use AWS's infrastructure
---
There's been a dogmeat in every fallout game, all spanning different parts of the USA and in different times in history. Only exception is rex in NV
---
There's absolutely room for a random dog character. Just so happens to be called dog meat.
---
Guess I’m blind, then. My bad!
---
At least it’s playable unlike RDO rn
---
Eventually when they add in legendary perks you'll be able to scrap them for perk coins to rank up legendary cards
---
I'll take a marine I'll be home in a few hrs around 3ish
---
Alright, thank you :)
---
I would be willing to bet that the devs are still in the process of figuring out what it means
---
Cranberry bog is pretty much infinite bots, but they scale with your level. Hit watoga, then go from firebase to firebase clearing all the gutsies and assaultrons.  Make a stop at the RobCo building.
---
Then hit watoga again and repeat on a loop.
---
You can alternately try to cap all of the low level workshops in the forest region and do the defence events. There is about a 1 in 5 chance to face either liberators or eye bots/protectrons. The waves can be anywhere from 10-30 robots. They will cap out at level 6. so you can just blast through them.
---
Both are going to be tough to do on pubbie servers though.
---
When they introduce the Legendary Perk Card System you should be able to convert them in to points to upgrade said new cards.
---
I smell a con, the NCR hasn't even been established yet...im watching u...
---
Yeah thats true as well. My main character really showed me how strong stealth is lol. Sheepsquatches and scorchbeasts just standing there shuffling around while I empty magazines into their face at point blank. 
---
Honestly I kinda wanted to move away from that though, but it might be necessary.
---
My unarmed character is normally wearing a full set of heavy BOS combat armor.
---
I would have liked a mysterious stranger type perk with dog meat as the helper.
---
Sounds good partner! 👍
---
I too saw that outfit and thought that mask was going to be perfect. I wasn’t disappointed.
---
I've verified files already... guess I'll try deleting the folder. I had no issues until after patch 21.
---
I wonder if instanced interiors will allow us to make our CAMPs quiter. For example, I could build my main camp on the surface while keeping noisy allys and collectron in the basement or vice versa so that I do not need to hear them when crafting stuff in my camp.
---
man that's smart I like that
---
Yup, agreed.
---
That wasn't the point I was making. All I was doing was pointing out their lie. 
---
Whether or not it makes sense to fulfil all these requests is another matter entirely.
---
using snowflake as an insult says that you really don't have a decent thought to reply with. It's the insult that stupid people use. And it's often a reflection of the fact that they are the ones who can't handle things. Meaning, they say snowflake, because they are the snowflake.
---
Thank you, unfortunately I'm on PC.
---
I think I can speak for both we are going to pass on that offer.
---
This way any chem should be useful bcz fast keyboard hit is better then DualShock wheel of favourites🙄
---
Enjoy =)
---
I don't get why you are being downvoted. Some freakin hackers hating on your comment I suppose. These hacked weapon's been around since forever and it's really surprising they didn't address this issue already. Maybe they think they can get away with all this cause it's PC only problem. We gotta make more noise about this. I'm sick of SBQ dying within 10 seconds. We've endured for the like last 8 months I believe? Enough is enough!  [u/LadyDevann](https://www.reddit.com/u/LadyDevann/)
---
That's awesome! I have a crippling shortage of caps even on my main character who's 160, but I still dedicate some shop space to putting basic plans for 10 caps, because I can't tell you how many times on an alt I've found awesome plans for 10 caps or less and bought them all. 
---
Now if I could figure out how much to sell small letters set for....
---
Yep, no fishbowl helmet. I'm salty. I wanted to wear that with one of my other outfits just to be weird.
---
*sad violin noises*
---
Man, that would be so nice.   When I got the Slocum joe vendor bot from the atom store, I had no clue how annoying they’d get lol
---
After spending some time in FO76 you’ll find any favourite on dualshock wheel very very fast))
---
Yea there is a big crowd of hacker/dupers/exploiters on this sub
---
Dude i find the fucking game tedious
---
Bows aren’t supposed to have the bullets explode effect on them.
---
Turn off the camp skin you activated in the atom store.
---
Cranberry relish, well rested, cranberry juice berry mentats plus broken unyielding  in a party puts me at 81 int so about 200% bonus xp takes me about 15 minutes to level up in the bog. I have a shopping center style camp northside of watoga I head tran yard to fissure and bos campsite then mad dash to the prime area it is about 16 packs of mobs. Normally see 2-5 legendaries which helps with my scrip fodder.   
---
Also the level up gives the most score at 500 the others are 250.   
---
\*When I say broken unyielding I am talking about if you are fighting a mob and force quit to the home screen, when you relog your unyielding gives double the stats.
---
I have both, I would argue differently. (Specced into explosives, currently holding 100+ mini nukes, 1000+ 40mm grenades, 100+ cannonballs, and 50+ missiles).
---
“Nor do they even know I exist.”
---
Nor do they even know they exist!
---
I swear I remember a few days ago that there is no level up challenge. Might have patched it to be random, let’s see the rest of the week if the challenge pop up daily.
---
When I saw the mask I was hoping they’d come out with something to match. I was too excited lol
---
They have a simple setting to limit how many camp objects are rendered at once. It's the camp budget. The weight limit and the camp budget are not arbitrary - they are both technical limitations.
---
I've never looked at a wood chipper the same
---
2 more levels for me and I might just buy the rest. I'm not sure. Or maybe wait a bit and do it. I'm already just doing the easy dailies.
---
Ad Victo—I mean, uh, patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.
---
Just finished the quest happy it’s over life can go back to normal
---
Ok. I told that I’m newbie))
---
But how Cola works in PvP? Why this drink is better than super stimpak?
---
I bet a lot of real life Moms would like to Nukashine their kids lol
---
Speaking of drama.....
---
Death threats are not a common reaction to enjoying fallout 76 and preferring Xbox to PlayStation.  That’s my point.  OP didn’t say that friends were threatening to kill them for their opinions.
---
How absurd.
---
That’s a shame
---
Not in pvp, but in general your hp &amp; ap regenerate faster
---
I'm level 190 and never use the favorites wheel because it's too slow and clunky for me (on Xbox) lol I only favorite items to help prevent me from selling or scrapping
---
Yup. I picked it up last week and didn’t think I had a perfect outfit for it. It didn’t really fit any of the ones I already had. The blood pack on this one kinda ties it and the mask together. I also liked the white raider gas mask. It give some color to a otherwise dark outfit.
---
Pretty sure you do. (or at least did)
---
Angry Turtle has cautioned on multiple occasions about perk card loss, from opening packs, when you have enough cards for all ranks of a perk (I.E. 1 card for a one star max perk, 3 cards for a 2 star max perk, 6 cards for a three star max perk, 10 cards for a four star max perk, 15 cards for a five star max perk)
---
If I understand it correctly if you open a pack and receive a card, for a Perk you already have the max total cards for, it is automatically discarded.
---
Well, what if the thing I want can’t drop from the wild? B2525 fixers can’t drop from the wild, if I recall correctly.
---
Since when did that happen
---
The problem I have with the level up challenges is that I feel like my character may be level 240, I still feel like I have the actual experience as a lvl 150 or lower. I can't run a nuke silo by myself because I'm still scared of dying or I'm constanly running out of ammo. Or just the usual lower lvl issues. I just know how to level up really fast when I need to. Not sure if what I am trying to say makes any sense.
---
Challenges are optional, no-one's forcing you to do them.
---
I only tested this on my T-60 so I hope it somewhat helps. 
---
I spawned in the middle of a nuke zone about 2-3 months ago. All my weapons where unarmed melee weapons and I didn’t have a hazmat suit. I was carrying way too much. So I decided to get inside my power armor. 
---
I had no choice but to fight the glowing ghouls with my fists. Since I couldn’t fast travel anywhere and obviously I didn’t have any weapons to use. 
---
My strength is 15. Obviously not counting the unyielding armor buffs at the moment. 
---
And I had two mods equipped for the power armor. One that adds bleeding damage to my punches (rusty knuckles) and one that adds energy damage to my punches (Tesla bracers)
---
I DID NOT have the perk that deals extra damage to glowing enemies, the one under perception. 
---
And even without that, it only took me about 3 punches to kill those high level glowing ghouls. 
---
I’m sure if I had equipped the glowing card maybe I would’ve killed those ghouls in 1-2 punches. But I just didn’t have enough points in perception at the time.
---
I know they’ve said they’ve made interesting stuff with the “pro-mode,” which is supposed to allow us to turn off object snapping. But yah, we’ll have to see. The interior being based around the exterior shell we create would be much cooler to me, but seems like a bunker would take a lot less effort to achieve what people have been asking. 
---
I just don’t see why you need a cool bldg above ground if it’s either still going to be empty on the interior and you can build something cooler underground. Plus then all the crazy builds with the Appalachian landscape would be possible.
---
Super duper no longer triggers when crafting assualtron helmets as of patch 21.
---
They forgot to enable them
---
I agree, I have a hard time setting off every trap I encounter all by myself.    Plus, there’s nobody getting in the way of my shots.   We def need dogmeat to fix these issues
---
I love hanging out at Berkley Springs for example, except for when my targets take off into the city to fight greenskins or raiders.  Stay on track guys, come on!  Side note, I often have to chase them down because all of them are busy destroying all the furniture.  Guess that's working as intended... everyone knows feral ghouls hate chairs and desks.
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again. They need to ask for the community's help. Tons of us have experience modding and fixing their games, tons of us would gladly dig in there and find fixes for this stuff if given the opportunity. Make it like a community service project, toss some Atoms and a unique cosmetic item at people that do it so they can show off that they were directly responsible for improving the game we all love/hate/love.
---
youll lose it anyway if youre not running starched genes..
---
no starched genes perk equipped eh?
---
Yeah you need a perk to prevent that from happening
---
Just run around a missile silo for a while.
---
It's been weeks now it displays all my info just not in the traditional hud form I'll check settings
---
Me too😂😂😂
---
“Exalted”
---
Found a WoW player over here lol
---
I didnt even know you could sell it..
---
Meanwhile it’s great to have:
---
1. herbivore(cranberry relish)/carnivore(tasty squirrel stew) 25% xp 
---
2. Well rested 5% xp 
---
3. Building team +4 int 
---
4. Cooked scorchbeast brain/ brain bombs +8 int
---
5. Inspirational 15% xp 
---
6. Orange mentats +5 int
---
Then do so. The fact that you’re rocking cannonballs makes me concerned for your judgement ;)
---
-HW/Explo build since BETA.
---
Not true.
---
and yet I can't help but think I've seen an encounter almost identical to it in another game recently....
---
In vending machines
---
You can't sell it.
---
It's pretty tedious to do it every day but my main is only level 231. I want to be at level 250 by the time they release the legendary perk cards. So it gives me some motivation to keep leveling up.
---
No worries, I just didn't want you to get your hopes up. When they made this change and announced the new attribute perk cards. The main concern  was you would  need to be lvl 2400 for a full levelled set of legendary perk cards. Attribute cards required 400 coins to level up fully  and cards like the infiltrator were in the region of 250 - 300 coins. So it will be interesting to see what they finally settle on
---
Oh really? Hit her with a mininuke and see what happens.
---
You can't.
---
I'll take ten!
---
Starch them genes bro. Leave it unequipped, drink your serums, then equip. You must have level 2 to be completely safe
---
Hmm, that sounds kinda encouraging. I wonder if the hydraulic bracers add more damage than the tesla? Or if they're stackable.
---
What's with the "Spin" part for that shits out bullets you can't pick up?
---
Again, you can't.
---
I know.. 
---
I didnt want to be the bearer of bad news.. lol
---
The grenades are trash but they look cool
---
The only problem I see with this is that there are only three power plants to power up and too many players on the map. Maybe it would work as a weekly. But it would be so nice to see all three powered up on the servers and when you claim a workshop and the whole Appalachia has power. Then it would truly feel like we are 'rebuilding America '
---
It’s funny, seasonal content like the Legendary Run is a double edged sword for me.  On the one hand, I feel compelled to play daily to get all the rewards before they go away.  On the other hand, deeper into the season that feeling of FOMO starts to get heavy and irritate me, like the grind becomes another job.  It’s that same feeling that churned me out of Destiny 2.  I jumped in with Forsaken, got through Forge, Drifter, Opulence and Shadowkeep, then churned with Dawn.  It’s funny because taking a two week vacation during Dawn actually sealed the deal; when I came back I felt so behind (and actually refreshed from having been forced out of the daily grind) that I couldn’t motivate myself to jump back on the hamster wheel.
---
Ooooh, really? I haven’t played a ton; the ones I actually remember I’ve seen every match. Do they actually say “inactive” or something?
---
Be the change you want to see in the world.  
---
I try to launch at least one nuke every long play session. The bunkers are fun and nuking is awesome!
---
I keep one in a display case. I've managed to get a few by stacking shitloads of luck buffing stuff. I sell them for about 1k caps usually, since people like to use them as decorations.
---
I don't mind being one! 😂
---
They have added eyepatches to the atom shop , they were on there a month or two ago?
---
Good luck with that.
---
Yes, because it takes me 30 seconds. Then I can go wherever again for more caps.
---
This one should be named Papa Dolce
---
I don’t even think it was that good of an exploit. I was only able to make a few of them until I ran out of fiber optics. Fiber optics are more rare than screws are and this method burned through them. Some responder robot vendors (Charleston, Grafton, Lewisburg, Whitesprings) sell bulk screws and that’s usually how I get the majority of my screws.
---
Idk what's got your panties in a wad.. but it is common. People get death threats all the time for the stupidest things. 
---
I even showed you an example regarding Fallout and it's not the only one. I also said I didn't think 90% were sincere- but also you can't just dismiss them on the off chance that the person person is psycho.
---
You need a new recall keycard. You get one for free for completing the side quest and if you blew your chance, you have to purchase it from a robot vendor. 1.75k caps with maximum discount if I remember correctly
---
You can see if nukes are on cool down with the Nuclear Silo Holotape.
---
Yes that tedious method works, but a much faster way to fix the glitch is to spam 3rd person to 1st person view button. Spam it really fast like 20 times and then try to exit. Didn't work? Try it again.
---
Sometimes it take a couple tries but it DOES work. And much easier than the method you describe.
---
Right now I'm just seeing if people are interested I'm sure I could find some way to actually sell it to you
---
Should've reverted back to the atom challenges. Hate to see what they're going to do for the downtime in between seasons "Hey, here's some caps and junk"
---
Buy ammo and invest in the bandolier perk.
---
Buy recipes including serums ones.
---
If you have the FO1st scrapbox you can buy junk and fill it up.
---
Shop player vendors and try finding a few gems. You can use these for different builds or sell them for caps later on.
---
Right and how is any of this shit related to the situation in question?
---
Marine helmets. You can craft them for like 1 glass, one plastic, and two rubber. Get rubber from the Grafton Gym kickball/basketball hoppers. This is how I get my daily 1400 from train vendors
---
I switched to ESO when it went on sale on PS4, and it feels like it’s run by a completely different company.  Group events function smoothly and scale up with even 50+ players, inventory content is reliable and safely shared between my different characters, and even when you do encounter the occasional glitch it’s almost always correctable by traveling through a doorway or just waiting a moment for the server to catch up.  And the best ones are hilarious, like my clan bro getting stuck as a small monkey for several hours in Coldharbour.  There’s almost nothing getting in the way of the gameplay, which is all most people really want.
---
How about a full auto 45 for pipe pistols? I don't think that exists. I could be wrong. Would be a nice addition as well.
---
Oh it's not that NCR, it's the New Coal Republic, founded by the Mole miners
---
Then they need to make it permanent like the vault tech gear bundle that no one has ever used.
---
You don't even need to have it unequipped while drinking a new serum.
---
usually I'm doing no PA at all
---
Ghouls are the best since they're always balls to the walls attacking. Just travel in and they'll find you.
---
Black Water Mine - kill everything (inside and out) and collect everything the mole miners have on them - the White Springs Station is right next door so you don't have to walk overencumbered too far.  Sell everything with the good bargains perk (can't remember exactly what that charisma perk card is called but J think that's it) and a grape mental if you have one.  You can usually max out your 1400/day cap limit in one or two visits.  If you happen to be there when the Uranium Fever event launches, you'll just clean up in one stop, and possibly walk away with three legendaries if there isn't another player there one-shotting them.
---
Turn around there is something of board near this location, where you can put the plans.
---
I can help you out in a couple hours if ya want. Do a few runs of at harpers ferry and west tek, sell all the guns, that’s usually over 1k
---
This is one of the reasons I don't bother with workshops.
---
her/she
---
Not sure why you downvoted me? Guess I was unclear.  
---
I was just trying to leave good wishes. Not sure where you found that implication, but you do you.
---
I ended up being wanted after someone did that and logged off. The workshop couldn't be used by anyone so I had to hack down the defences to get to the bench.
---
Maybe if EVERYONE in the game didn’t run a bloodied build, we could put a realistic amount of shots on Leggies w/o people getting so mad all the time.
---
"most of the other ones feel really lonely" they were supposed to feel that way. To support the game's themes. They weren't supposed to be some kiddy playground to fuck around in.
---
Ok thanks for that.  I still have the UNSOLVED quests to do, so hopefully that will help me out.
---
Thanks again.
---
Ok I don’t have black water mine on my map uh what direction is it from whitespring
---
I would even accept Private Lucky as an ally.
---
We won't go quietly. The scorched can count on that.
---
I did that, too. But it took a very long time until she mentioned the Order to me. I was wondering if that was because of the dress I gave her or if it was just the regular text she says to everybody.
---
Man that's just ridiculous to be honest, I hope they make some changes before it goes life
---
Sorry I’ll be on at like 8 or 9 I’m busy today
---
I probably won’t be on then, but add me if you want. Jtrag. If ya see me, just msg me 👍🏻
---
I'm almost there, currently at lvl 94.   
---
Me personally, I'm still going to be doing my same routine.  I'm thinking it will be nice break for a couple weeks to not have daily's, before next season starts (don't know when that is).    
---
FO76 is my addiction and I play daily regardless of the pass. But I 100% agree, that I would like to be earning atoms after I complete the Season.  Seems like an oversight, but hopefully they make that change for the next season.
---
Only if he's a Chow.
---
It’s a waste of budget space. I scrapped that asap.
---
Love the suggestion of being able to dual wield pistols. That would be so much fun!
---
Sorry i should have been clear. This was addressed in the recent patch notes.
---
Is the item still available? If I track say....my friends raider instead of mine?
---
Same, I went Herbivore and needed dirty water to boil so I can make my soups. Smiley clock to camp down where I can get three large water purifiers down to sell water and simply collect the water manually to boil for my soups and drinks.
---
They can. You can buy the explosive mod in the game.
---
They say "inaccessible" which is the same as if they've already been looted.
---
Terminals/boxes are pretty popular - people tend to spawn next to them, so chances are if you'rs finding them late game they've already been looted
---
I'd rather just have a random dog. I want my Red Heiler and name it Dog. Just need to add Dinki-Di dog food so i can feed him
---
As mention it gets added on the new rotation. Though technically we didn't meet the requirements... technically we fell 146 million short so Bethesda just lowered it.
---
They won't give Atoms after completing because they are hoping you'll use Atoms to complete it, so that would defeat the purpose. It's sad. I really liked when daily challenges awarded atoms instead of this crap. Ghillie suits and perk packs and whatnot. Ironically, I was more inclined to purchase Atoms back when they were more readily available than I am now (though admittedly I never needed to buy atoms - I would have if they had enough appealing stuff in the shop to warrant it). It does suck to get nothing after  completing the run. Hopefully in the next season they have something set up for this to award the grinders.
---
 \- Items being displayed or for sale should not count in the total "weight" of the C.A.M.P. stash   
---
**Don't think Bethesda would allow this. Everyone would just dump as much as they can into vendors otr display for more storage. Put all of their ammo in there with each round costing 30000 so no one would buy.**   
---
 \- Following the same logic from my previous statement it's counter-intuitive that you'll get such a low budget (in my opinion) for how much stuff you can put in your base.   
---
**Look up news of the new instanced interiors addressing this.**   
---
  PLEASE add some kind of visual indication (e.g. Icons, abbreviations) to tell if a item is a rifle, melee weapon, regular armor or power armor. As a new player it's so confusing to buy a brand new piece of armor just to find out it's for power armor only   
---
**Cool, but meeh**   
---
 \- Make it so we can actually preview/see items in the shop, not knowing how they look like or those tasty extra legendary status is really annoying   
---
**Preach sister**  
---
 \- Make it possible for power armor chassis to show which armor pieces are equipped while in the inventory, it'd be amazing if people could use that to sell complete sets of power armor all in one pack.   
---
**This!!!**
---
I didn't downvote you bud?
---
or eat the dinki di ourselves
---
Seen a thing get stuck under a concrete platform. Lots of grenades and special ammo didn’t work but molotovs did eventually.
---
I felt the same completing a Season in Diablo 3. In the end it was work and not what it should  be: fun.
---
Me? I sell all of my excess scrap to regular vendors along with mothnam egg omelets and whatever chems ive accumulated since the prior day
---
If I wasnt too lazy to wait and actually had power running to my vending machine I could def make more.. but I just cant be assed to do it...
---
 thanks friend
---
Did you forget to log out of reddit before you lent your phone to your dog?
---
Unfortunately people are like
---
"Haha bloodied go brrrrr"
---
He seems pretty worked up. I don’t know if he has taken a step back to understand where the break in communication happened.
---
explosive on bows is only allowed as mod, not as legendary affix
---
This feels like a mistake. 
---
I have a hunch that the Fixer special effect is applied through the special skin on it, which is why it isn’t currently able to be changed. I know they plan to make this an option, but I can see this becoming a new issue that it will lose it’s listed effect when painted.
---
Not really. 4 unyielding, cranberry relish, and lovers embrace help.
---
Apparently you can repair a nuclear power plant very easily, all you need is like 30 steel
---
Medical goggles
---
Thank you! I'll be honest I've been on reddit 7 years and never once remembered when it was lol
---
Ahhh I see now
---
I have some legendary and plain rifles that hit better than my suppressors night vision handmade. That makes me think; why hit only 72 with all three of my rifleman perks. Is it always going to be like this? You see, My ordinary marksman’s makes 139 damage.
---
No bulk screws. That was the first thing I tried
---
&gt;chests that don’t show loot,
---
This is a bug? I thought other players had just cleared them out before me.
---
Since you can only have one mod on each arm I prefer using Tesla or rusty. 
---
I rather have one of my fists do 2 different types of damage, instead of having it just do one type of extra damage.
---
Does this make all weapons weight 0? Or is their some kind of min weight?
---
On Mt Blair I set up turrets in hopes of using them as signals, and they did get one or two. But the counter was only halfway for the first wave. I did a perimeter search at least three times before working on some blueprints for NW. On my way up to check on the extractor I finally ran into three just standing near the stairs. 
---
I had set up a single heavy turret behind a cement barrier on each set of stairs. The scorched (and later super mutants) wouldn't attack the barrier and couldn't get past it, so they were just stuck in a hiding spot. I even left one set of stairs open to try to funnel them in, but no dice. If there were more of them or if they were more aggressive it would have helped.
---
You should get 20 atoms per daily and 50 per weekly
---
All weapon weights reduced by x amount.  
---
Oh and it stacks with perks
---
I like to wear it with the Vampire outfit :)
---
Thanks a bunch! I totally must of missed it!
---
Is there another set of patch notes somewhere though? I can't seem to find anything listed about it [here.](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2Z8aZWK1CISDkxWAcwQhw8/fallout-76-update-21-patch-notes-august-4-2020)
---
Because it was an accidental scrapping which can be caused by the game lagging out while you're in the menu!
---
I hadn't thought about the extra loading screen. Maybe they'll bust out the fast travel mats for personal use only so we can load directly to our SHELTER.
---
I usually price junk at 1/5-1/4 listed value, I’m usually not too worried about selling my junk as I can sell it to vendors. But it helps to control my junk growth so I don’t need to sell any.
---
Thing is, its what a decent amount of people want, to get more money they’d put it for limited time, they want to draw people in so that’s why it’s not permanent
---
I was just thinking about this yesterday
---
I do and have done, always get loot.
---
I’ve met all SCORE workshop challenges so far since the beginning of the Run and never got dragged into PvP ... Not. One. Time. All I do is claim an open one on a public server and walk away, leave the PvP zone for others to fight over it. 
---
If people really want the workshop mats, then it’s time for them to cowboy up and fight for it and start studying their opponents to see why they succeed. It’s not just legacy magic OP weapons. There is some of that laziness, sure, but a lot of PvP guys go back to Survival mode and really put some thought into their loadouts. Workshops are intentional Thunderdomes. It’s not toxic that other players have built their characters to be really, really good at two men enter, on man leaves.
---
I haven’t crafted a fixer yet but all my legendary and nonlegendary handmades make so little damage. I can’t believe when you say it packs a punch. :)
---
Use a gauss rifle in vats and tell us how it works out
---
Ooooh I haven’t seen the vampire outfit!
---
Without starched genes it was inevitable
---
Just want to say that I like that kind of involvement with the community!
---
Go to Watoga Station, bulk it all up, eat grape mentats or equip Hard Bargain perk - heck do both, and sell it, profit.
---
You get some XP for bulking, so be well rested, have cranberry cobbler, gut shroom soup, canned meat stew, or whatever your aid item of choice for xp boosting is handy.
---
Outer Worlds was mediocre and Epic Games exclusive. Coppled with the whole Epic Game Store debate, the game went under. Rightfully so. Cyberpunk, even if it will only be on Witcher 2's level of good, imagine 3, will obliterate every other game around the time of its release
---
Aim for the legs, splash damage still hits. One-hit most anything besides boss enemies, breaks wicked fast though.
---
Without sneak, is fixer better in vats?
---

---
With that mask it makes me feel like Jack the Ripper
---
Oh my god this shit is so annoying. One time one of those dogs spawned inside a concrete block type of thing. I tried everything to explode him with no sucess. Tried travelling to the other side of the map and back, nothing. Eventually I left the location and failed the event. Such bs.
---
That one extra concrete was the brick Todd shat when realizing we don’t care about the terrible “event” they’re running with no real rewards.
---
It was caused by not being cautious. He stated "enter-spamming".
---
Or mail it to someone else. That would be cool
---
I almost bought one yesterday from the atom shop but then I encountered a CAMP with 4 of them which changed my mind.
---
No one said Bethesda couldn’t donate it themselves
---
I can see them retaking Camp Venture without any issues. I'd like to see them set up a memorial for Taggerty and her branch of fallen BoS at either Camp Venture or at Atlas.
---
Beer hat + plague doc mask = win
---
Don't forget standing in the door.
---
Need more space in the camp budget...
---
Only if you have serums.    But you can just sit in rads with it off until you get marsupial back.   Just gotta radaway until you get marsupial then pop stach genes back on.
---
Would Dogmeat get A Marsupial perk, too?
---
[patch 20](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/47XE9Dbh3weAd5kusOIA8p/fallout-76-update-20-patch-notes-june-30-2020)
---
At least I assume that’s what they meant by the 4th bullet under perks
---
Yes and if the servers wern't lagging so much its easier to judge a spam scrapping.
---
You got the rewards, you just got them early.
---
Or they will accidentally allow us to convert combat rifles into fixers by painting them to the default fixer paint. Lol. With Bethesda you can never guess all the possible bugs they might introduce. Let's hope for a good one instead of a bad one.
---
Lol.
---
You chose wisely
---
If I take a workshop I ignore the defend event and wait for the retake event. Usually less creatures, one wave and they’re already there. I’ve had some weird glitch lately where I just ignore it for a while and it completes even though I’m clear across the map.
---
There are... You get 500. How is this not the to comment yet?
---
I’m trying to add a sibling to my rifle family. I have two railways, a marksman’s hunting (my best. Great in and out of vats) and a legendary aa lever action. 
---
I guess I’ll choose the one that makes the most damage.
---
I don’t know about epic games (I play on Xbox). The point is the game was over hyped and under delivered big time.
---
Only you can't. They are locked to your account.
---
Doing so would be an exploit.
---
Water. Like out of the toilet?
---
Woof
---
*Donates* 
---
OP: "Truth is... the game was rigged from the start"
---
I wouldn't call damage control of their event donating. That makes it sound like they're helping instead of basically completing it for us so they don't look even worse than they already do.
---
If you’ll be on in a couple hours that marine helm would be amazing
---
... no. He scrapped it because he wasn't cautious. It has nothing to do with lags. No lag was mentioned in the post. Let it go, you're just hating on beth support from pure spite.
---
i'd just be happy if NPC enemies had to literally attack the workshop to disable outputs meaning that they could be set to fight it if it cant find players.
---
I prefer to call it a joke. *cue laughter*
---
Not fair for people that haven't finished yet.
---
At most, I would say you get some extra XP. But atoms? No way.
---
It’s seriously astonishing. I’ve spent 500 hours on ESO and I feel like I’ve barely scratched the surface. Some nights, I have to make myself stop playing because I get so lost in it. There’s very little that gets in the way of me playing, unless the servers are literally down. 
---
Compare that to FO76 where I struggle to have fun for more than an hour at a time now.
---
I sell steel scrap (not bulk) in my vendor for 1cap each and that shit sells. I can easily sell 6k a day if I'm up to it. I only sell copper when I'm really hard up for caps and i put that at 4 caps each. I don't bother selling anything else. Can't imagine why anyone would buy bone or cork (except for the current challenge). As others mentioned, you could bulk what you don't use and sell to vendor bots. I prefer to keep my plastic though so I don't bother with all that.
---
They have been in the atom shop twice . With variations
---
These. They clip, but in a good way.
---
u have to dip him in toxic waste first
---
True.  I usually get Radscorpions at both Grafton steel and Monongah - Grafton steel is usually 3x waves of at least 3 L60+.    I've been known to abandon the defend because members of the 2nd or 3rd wave refuse to come out and play within a reasonable amount of time.
---
If I take Monongah, I can also leave if they take too long, but my camp is close by - they will follow me to camp.
---
I think you are out of luck.  I am in the same boat.  I had to clear my local saved data once before because of an issue and all of my pictures got deleted.  I'm currently having lots of issues with freezing and CTDs and the recommendation is to uninstall and re-install but I don't want to lose my pictures again so just been putting up with it.
---
xD I feel this man
---
I second this.  When you look at fallout 3, fallout 4, and Skyrim/Skyrim SE, there is still the need for the community unofficial patch.  Even after its end of support from Bethesda, the community modders continued fixing bugs and other mistakes that Bethesda overlooked.  Add the mod support they claimed they would add, and the community could clean this mess up in a couple weeks.
---
Oh, you are just begging for a new vending glitch. Don’t you put that evil on us.
---
Explosive (not the legendary effect) heavy weapons need a buff.
---
They don't want us to get the reward for the cork one, that could take away from them making money.
---
my aa lever is becoming my favorite. But I wanna add one more to my collection. I guess I’ll try both of them in both non-auto and commando.
---
Who remembers leveling up skills in Oblivion? Summon a skeleton, shoot the skeleton with the practice arrow so you don't kill it, heal the skeleton with the spell in your other hand, change weapons, kill the skeleton with a dagger, change back to the bow, repeat as needed. 
---
Seriously, Bethesda has been doing grind as gameplay for years, to keep people from burning through the storytelling (which is really their talent) like a comic book in one sitting.
---
I'm not saying you're wrong, but I'm confused as to why you think a Bethesda game wouldn't be exactly like what we're playing?
---
I guess I'll just sell it vendors like you do. I just thought I'd sell it using the auction machine to help out the fallout community if they needed any scrap. In game it says 0 under value so I don't know what it would go for.
---
If the numbers are legit people were probably stocking up on it since they released the materials. People want that extra SCORE weekend.
---
Lag doesn't really need to be mentioned, it's a fact of life since patch 21, there aren't any smooth running servers right now!
---
Hmm. It's not showing any cork donated when I look.
---
Unfortunately, this is the downside to getting done 'too quickly'. Personally, I'm taking a break and working on my game backlog when I finish the Run.
---
You do you 👍🏻
---
Is someone with a gun to your head to make you login every day? If you didn't pay for Fallout 1st ***you literally have no financial obligation*** to play the game.
---
Fallout 76 seems to clear it's photos when you uninstall and reinstall it so you won't be able to get them as loading screens any more - but every single photo you take is automatically stored on your PS4 capture gallery and can still be viewed/transferred off the ps4 from there.
---
I think I prefer vats. Is fixer really the one to go with vats?
---
While this is sort of true for Steel (it's easy to have lots of it thanks to Scraper Perk Card as many others already mentioned), it's wrong in case of Concrete or Cork. These are not the resources that you can easily get from scraping, so it's more like Bethesda managers underestimated the actual numbers. Which is crazy cause any competent data scientist would figure that out (given that to get usage etc. one would have to query multiple servers unless they have reporting; if they have reporting then data is probably stored in something like Hadoop, so it's a job for a data scientist).
---
Do you group up for the SBQ? Your teammates were probably tagging her for you.
---
Yeah I think I'll go and bulk that stuff up. Just acid farming can be pretty time consuming.
---
That's why they call it Fallout 1st. For $12.99 a month you get there first.
---
Shhhh....
---
what? you mean you dont like looking for that lone feral ghoul hiding in a bush outside the workshops boundries??
---
You seem to be taking this very personally. Are you one of those who likes to use the GG EZ mode? 
---
Everyone knows bloodied is silly OP. And anyone says otherwise is lying to themselves and making themselves look like a clownshoe. 
---
And as a Junkie i have no problem saying junkies needs nerfing as well
---
Insulation for the personal bunkers we'll be able to make later in the year.
---
True. I'll definitely have to try that out. Thanks!
---
I don’t wanna drop my 3 stars and work my ass off for more... how pointless
---
Iirc all are set to 90%.
---
20-40-60-80-90
---
I'd love one that combines all of the weight reduction perks so I can finally drop them, before dropping my precious loot.
---
Aight, you're just too stupid to understand aren't you
---
Ok but every handmade I meet has low dps. That makes me think. Will the damage ever go above 100 if I mod it heavily??
---
Is that a bannable offense?
---
Yep. I am missing a depressing number of Ultracite mods. I really wish they'd take the PA plans out of the lootpool and up the chance of getting mods.
---
I don't think anyone has or will be actually punished for having those things in their base, you're fine
---
Within three camp visits I usually find 5.56 at 1c s piece. So yeah, good luck with your ammo sales.
---
It's also a fact that support are lying about not having the tools!
---
I’m thinking of going commando in the future. Are autı rifles work well with vats?
---
I suggest an idiot with high endurance and lots of luck. I think that's the role to play.
---
I heard that ESO is a great game. Is that the case? If so, maybe some of the decisions made on ESO should be applied to FO76 too?
---
FWIW, 76 is my second favorite Fallout and I have played then all except Tactics. But there are many situations lately of trial and error that should not happen when there is already a MMO in the same  company.
---
I was using a new character to level up a lot of the days as I played through the main quest line.  Now he's mostly done with the content, and I'm almost done with the Legendary board, I may start playing another one I started. I don't know, I hate the level up one personally.
---
Have 2 or 3 fully kitted out power armours. I have the digger for when I'm ore hunting, t51 b one with jetpack for silos and strangler armour for when stuff gets real like a queen fight or the new colossus wendigo event coming soon
---
Yo dawg, I heard you like updates...
---
The post is stickied at the top of the sub, too.
---
I swear, I do not understand the fascination people have over this.
---
So, you get rewards for doing the dailies from the Run. And then you should get more rewards after you complete the Run? 
---
At least your suggestion of a vault tec supply package is reasonable, and makes me think, that might not be a bad idea. For every 1,000 score you get a medium one. Or the large was for 2,000 score. Or 3,000 for a lunch box.
---
I want the atom rewards back.
---
Did the same thing! Still trying to decide on a hat for it, but the mask + the quack outfit is perfect.
---
That would be annoying to use just because displayed items take up budget but items in a vending machine don't.
---
*Crawls out from under a rock of general grinding*
---
What is everyone going on about with Atlas?
---
Bug sniffing and content development are separate teams, so while the sentiment is fine, it's an unnecessary request.
---
The really sad thing is that the fast travel bug, for example (and my own daily scourge), might take some work to reliably replicate and trace, but once someone finds it, the actual code fix is likely to be exceptionally simple.
---
Yeah they did! And it was literally like a week after I was thinking, I'd like an eyepatch! BAM! There it was.
---
Now I need them to bring the fez! Yes, please the Fez!
---
10/10 Would smash.
---
5, take all my perk coins.
---
Need the plan for the flamethrower and the two perks needed to use it
---
I think it's the higher ups that don't care, cause they still see $$$. 
---
So until people cancel fo1st, which they won't, we won't see drastic change.
---
Almost feels like having weekly rewards for logging in would be better.
---
Wait, that’s pretty much how Amazon works: if I look at a book it indicates that I’ve already purchased it. 
---
Not only will they not try and sell me a second copy, but I’m pretty sure that I can’t buy a second copy (at least not easily - the “buy” button is completely replaced with a “read now” button).
---
Not saying that everyone would want that behavior in 76, but ebook vendors do this for their own ecosystem all the time.
---
AFIK, the gamo only sees and uses the 50 in your ingame photogallery, but the photos are not lost
---
check your PS4 photos folder.  there should be a subfoldered named FO76, and all pictures you took in game prior to the reinstall should be there.
---
Didn’t a bunch of community modders already put a list on here, a while back, which told the devs exactly what was wrong in the code, how to fix it, and were roundly ignored? A lot of it was minor tweaks that could’ve added up to a notable difference.
---
Stealth cammando is amazing and if you go bloodied it's best biuld in game imo
---
It's also a fact that you're unable to comprehend simple facts and only see everything through lenses of hate. Your internet or your pc is probably utter garbage, hence you're encountering lags or fps drops (judging by the convo you don't know the difference) in every session you enter. I don't know why they told him they don't have the tools, while they could have just literally told him the will not return the item but it again has nothing, absolutely nothing with your initial point.
---
BS
---
Cork has no extractors.  Cork doesn’t come from common weapons.  You don’t just go farm cork like a madman, it’s on a similar level as concrete.  Nearly 3000 hours in, a consummate hoarder with 1st from the start and I barely have 5000 cork across all my characters.  Steel?  Nearly 200k and I routinely give that away to friends for ammo.  
---
I have no qualms just calling this made up numbers now.  I believe the concrete numbers, but this?  No freaking way.
---
Every train station has a robot that gets 1400c every 20 hours after you sell to them.  Grape mentats help too as sell price is based on charisma. also sell glowing meat steaks 11c each at max charisma , two runs of westek gets me my 1400c a day or westek plus behemoth and that is 10m to 20m of work with a good build.
---
i was lucky with grenades and a gatling gun and killed them through the doors
---
How fucking braindead are you? Are you so easily entertained that you still play this shit. Stop supporting bethesda for being such shit developers
---
Yeah I definitely saw that play a part in my own grind - I was pretty relaxed and not grinding horribly but once all my friends gave up and started buying levels and started being done - I was left to finish this grind by myself - not that they wouldn't help me but it feels bad dragging people along for a grind they've already finished.
---
And that is also what kind of stopped me from returning to WOW. I really loved that game but I've been gone for a couple years and there's no way at this point I could catch up to everything and I don't really want to try
---
Fuck yeah! I want a pachyderm perk card!
---
So, I got one-shot while standing in a workshop the other day.  Is there any benefit to the shooter? I didn't have any scrap on me or resource extractors up. I suspect you earn atoms eventually, but is there an immediate reward other than the self gratification of being a murder hobo? Have I been missing out on rewards by not engaging in workshop pvp
---
Zero change in the company line since last week. Not very promising. Its a real kick in the pants to get pumped up by something like this being in the patch notes and then have it yanked away due to botched development.
---
I use Grenadier, so I was hyped for new grenades. Chucked a few, each was soul-crushingly disappointing, and switched back to my Nukas. I hate looting the floater grenades because they're so tedious to drop and aren't worth throwing.
---
Yes, also a shotgun barrel/reciever for the pipe rifle.
---
I mean, pipe rifles give cork and are pretty damn common
---
I’d just be happy if buying didn’t default to the entire inventory. “No, I don’t want to buy 73 Mounted Bloatfly Head plan: 1 is enough, thank you.”
---
Recently I left in the middle of defending Poseidon because some super mutants were taking way too long to spawn. Fast traveled out but didn’t leave the event for some reason? 
---
Map markers finally show and they’ve followed me to my camp. ...in the Mire.
---
I don't understand what you mean by that
---
Yeah same here. Glad to have a break between now and the next season. I am excited for Meat Week but that might be all I do you know? But I also missed out on the past meat week because work and stuff so.
---
Alright thanks
---
I'm glad I grinned to level 100 for the NW rewards, it changed my outlook on the game mode. If those weren't there I would have never gotten into it. Now, I look forward to the NW dailies. Interesting to see all those who claim to never have done a single NW daily.
---
No armor.
---
Only combat knife.
---
Stab until target stops moving!  /s
---
You are usually better off just waiting for the retake event so the mobs are consolidated to a single wave and usually much closer together.
---
remove the camp skin
---
Stop using the skin until they fix it. You'll have to unequip it and move again.
---
Finish the lifetime challenges.
---
The only floater grenade I can't pick up as world items are the Floater Gnasher Grenade.
---
there's occasionally a challenge to rank up a perk card.  duplicates are good for that.
---
I keep one of each series (i.e. 1 star leveled, 2 star leveled, max leveled) so I might be able to run at least some kind of level depending on the points being used by other cards.
---
Dark matter looks meh. I want the other skins to apply tho
---
Ruined the radio in my opinion
---
Take a break and play something else!
---
I don’t really see why they’d fake the numbers in this event and not for concrete
---
Also, join a public team for free fast travel spots. That will help. Are you on Xbox?
---
I hope that you are able to finish it! And good on you for at least trying haha. So many people put their head down like "I refuse to try NW!! Todd can't make me!!" It did make me happy to see so many new faces in the lobbies. Because it really starts to be the same people all the time. I just hope that some people come to enjoy it like I did.
---
I started just doing it for the cosmetics but if you find a couple of people that fit your style of play it can be a lot of fun. It's fun just goofing off. Sometimes my friend and I just build goofy things in that mode to see how people react to the weird "non-tactical" camps lol
---
that's y i hardly listen now
---
And to think, I'd be happy if the gallery would just stop deleting itself during updates.
---
I thought there was one at 75 and it was after 100 it was every 50 levels.
---
It makes it conducive for spending atoms. 😜
---
Yep. The wasteland is a harsh mistress.
---
Golf balls bro.... funny story though some kid made a post saying crafting and scraping pipe pistols was the most efficient way to get cork and I explained golf balls was better and he shouldn't be wasting screws and now hes on everyone of my post saying I'm toxic lol. Some people are ridiculous
---
protip: start a new character, level up once, delete it, wonder what you're doing with your life, chew bubblegum
---
I'll use this tactic on the scorchbeast queen! Thanks lmao
---
Well it ends in september but I am not sure what date. But I am also limited by work and things so I was definitely trucking right along trying to get it done. I am definitely going to try to pace myself better next time.
---
Yes they do. Very well. I do around 1800 dmg per shot on unarmored and around 200 dmg to queen when up close when bloodied sneak on auto
---
Calm down Karen
---
He's just a dick.
---
And Bethesda couldn't care less about this glitch.
---
Place scarecrows, enemies attack them, so if you place some around the general spawn points you can quickly clear the waves.
---
Rank 3 Sneak and Covert Operative plus Escape Artist is all I use. Swap to the Chinese Stealth Suit as needed but most of the time my normal armor is plenty stealthy enough with those perks.
---
I believe a small amount of caps goes from the dead player to the killer.
---
But other than that it's just about making their peepee hard.
---
I honestly wouldn't care about the PVP aspect if they actually took the workshop. But no, they just like one shotting players from stealth. 
---
This is why I avoid them on public servers like the plague.
---
It's a terrible idea. At the very least, the numbers are far too high. I am level 420 something, and I could barely even max one or two of the cards without scrapping practically all of my cards. They made it worse when they made animated cards give 1x the points (although with 5x the points it still sucked). I have played the game for nearly ***two thousand*** hours, I should have a fully maxed out set of legendary perks, and without having to sacrifice my ***entire catalogue*** of perk cards to do so.
---
Not to mention that the vast majority of the cards aren't good effects. There's nothing useful for PA players. To their credit, the new SPECIAL cards are actually amazing, and the auto-lockpicking-hack card is more in line with what I expected... but reduced sprint speed in PA? Fusion core charge gained when shot with energy attacks? Are they serious?
---
I did quite a lot MMO (wow included) and most time the end reputation called like that.
---
I wouldn’t mind dying trying to defend my base against a formidable enemy and then the map is alerted that a human player has been evicted by crazed robots or some high level super mutants. Then each camp would turn into a mini game to conquer it back with friends.
---
Alright thank you
---
Nope! A hidden benefit possibly in that way haha.
---
Tbh I just got it cause I thought it was a large flower pot I didn't even know it collected water
---
k
---
Thanks.  I'll try that.
---
i agree. going up 100 levels by the end of this seems extreme.
---
She's ok to me 🤷‍♂️
---
What is so special about these weapons?
---
I can see some have crazy range, but how does this affect you? Why should they be deleted?
---
(New Player so i really dont know)
---
Because debate is interesting? If you treat games like other art/media, debating any work can be interesting. 
---
I think you're mistaking my strong opinions for being entrenched.  I'm always willing to take a second look when someone presents a legit, well thought out opinion on something.
---
Just do the best you can- events and team up with people. You still have about a month to finish it and I think this atlas thing with the BOS might unlock more double score?
---
I started at fasnacht like a week or so before so I never did meat week looks fun and I can focus that instead of score grind after work
---
  loot everything.  Scrap, bulk, and sell to bot vendors.  Equipping hard bargain, eat a grape mentats, and consuming any alcohol that boosts CHR before selling will increase what you are paid.
---
Even the mutfruit, blackberrys and other plants you usually ignore can be sold to the bots.
---
That was someone doing daily or weekly cjallenges.
---
yes
---
Dupers want that double score weekend
---
Whats funny is if you turn off the main menu audio the atom shop audio still kicks in after a while.
---
I've personally donated 43 million
---
No no no, throw up emote is for laughably delusional vendor prices.
---
PlayStation 4pro, 200mbps hardwired Internet, lag started on the day patch 21 dropped, game is running slower than B.E.T.A. No problems with any other online game. 
---
It's a fact that support lied to him. It's a fact that support refuses to help anyone with problems with quests breaking. 
---
It's a fact that support refuses to help anyone with score going missing.
---
I liked her just need to continue updating her seasonally. With other games they would announce stuff going on in game so it didn't get as stale.
---
Nope I like her and think it doesn’t make sense not to have one since you’re listening to a radio. It’s better now. 
---
Plus it reminds me of fallout 4 with Travis Miles. If you think he wasn’t repetitive and she is then I don’t know what to tell you.
---
I’m a longtime fallout player but avoided it because of the bad press. I can see why the initial game was poorly reviewed and it is probably still as I typing this a year away from actually being ready for release.
---
That said, having a great time
---
How would we go about meeting up for this, since, unless I'm not understanding something, you can't add someone as a friend without first encountering them in the game
---
I'm using the 'Thesda Launcher btw.
---
Okay, duper.
---
I camp in the Toxic Valley myself, and it's mostly to all toxic water there only as you might know. I cook alot when I'm at my camp, so that little dirty water is appreciated even still. When I don't feel like pumping my IRON ARMS at my water crank or water fountain, I just go to that little barrel cutey and grab a bit of the Dirt Liquid!
---
I think 4 water per barrel collector might be better myself haha, BUT you can always put more than one down like real survivalist might do! Kinda like in The Forest with the turtle shell water collectors! Anyway, I like the thing for what it's worth heh.
---
Thank you based one
---
It’s because they hold more items.
---
All of the little dailies take me about 20-30 minutes - when I say grind I am talking about the endless server hopping for radiation rumble/line in the sand/guided meditation or farming super mutants when events aren't spawning over and over and over to get as much on the repeatable as I could. And normally when I play - no I don't really do events. I enjoy just wandering around and chillin with my friends and building and things like that. Events are a means to an end but don't really hold any rewards that I need right now. Tho I am really excited for the colossus event! I need that totem at my camp!
---
For sure,  they stink on ice, and that's why I was saying I can see them as a random spawn that attacks the workshop, but would like them removed from the event enemy list.
---
She's fine in a vacuum but like any NPC, after awhile, starts to wear thin.  Which is the problem with pretty much any NPC.  Once you've heard all their lines 10 times they are just annoying.
---
Starch those genes
---
They heal more hp than stims, restore ap so you can perma vats a persob down
---
Interesting fact about the Mountainside's basement is that it the only location in the game you can obtain the Meat Cleaver throwable, outside of Grahm's Meat Cook event.
---
That’s impressive! I can’t wait to try it!
---
I am sorry, but I laughed hard. There is this "extra" second in which you realise what has happened. We watched you die inside.
---
Now, you should know most of the players I know, including myself, have sold or scripped that heavy 50 cal. Not the end of the world. Also, you can create a new character and do the quest, get a new copy of the weapon and pass it to the main character via friend, if you really miss it. 
---
Some people sell it for 3K. I tried to sell it for 2K. No luck.
---
What's even weirder is if you hang out in the bed and wait for them to come rushing in (I had to know what would happen) and kill them then, the lady that owns the place also comes rushing up and she is hostile, too. I wound up having to kill her and her forgetful hubby, too, which I didn't expect. On another character, I had done a speech check to find out from her that she was being "forced" to let them stay and eat guests, so I went ahead and found them &amp; killed them right away and then I was stuck with her just repeating a line about how she can't believe she &amp; her hubby survived the gunfire. That second round, though, where she went hostile after I killed them in the room made me wonder if she was in on it, somehow, too? Or was it just a bug?
---
Yeah it's kind of weird to me that secret service wasn't included? Coulda replaced a perk pack reward lol
---
Dunno, the CW had very little to change. Almost no plant growth, and most of the buildings are probably almost as tumbled as they were. If anything, just the people and their location would change.
---
Can confirm, I was the ATLAS provisions.
---
donning
---
They don't know that you exist because they don't even exist yet.
---
600-800 damage with my TS Fatman.
---
Yeah one of my friends works over nights and he would come home and try to do his dailies before he passed out D:
---
It is tedious, that's why I don't do it, and I recommend you not doing it either. Play the game for reasons that you want to, not for what Bethesda tells you to do.
---
What are you gonna do with your 172,000 bottles of wine and 344,000 floater grenades?
---
Yesterday was trying to defend Posedien and there were enemies trapped in the ground. They never came up to be killed. Pisses me off royally
---
Vegas, yeah, I can see them avoiding that. But we're getting BoS from california, would not be surprised if we head back that way to deal with whatever caused them to come thing way.
---
Cork is much easier to come by than Concrete in Fallout 76, even if individual items that scrap from the give less per scrap, there are more items available to scrap.
---
Bethesda: *yaaaaaawn*
---
If you manage it, I’ll eat my .50cal 😉
---
My first thought 😂
---
SOLVED: somehow switching from windowed with borders to fullscreen, closing the game, turning it to adaptive in Nvidia control panels, starting the game, close and turn of vsync completely in control panel, start the game WORKED.
---
just turning of Vsync in CP while on fullscreen didnt help. i had to go to adaptive first...
---
i think im going insane
---
It’s still the same shitty model with a broken panel sticking out the bottom.
---
I'd love to build a workshop with a team. I didn't know you could do that. But instead I had a team mate fast travel to my workshop leave the team then kill me and take the workshop
---
Yeah that's definitely fair - I like that we are finally getting skins for all the armors - I just hope there are more neat ones in the future. I think the blood paint for the combat armor is the only paint that's ever made me take off my outfit to show it off you know? It looks really nice with the waster underarmor and the raider eye-patch.
---
I haven't noticed the Civil War Top hat clipping with it...and the whole outfit (or the priest vestments) looks somewhat Plague Doctor-y
---
Based dupers are carrying us.
---
P.S: myself donated 250.
---
Yeah I think I’ve heard of it but never seen it or anything
---
I loaded into a game with a bug where every safe was already unlocked. Anyone else have that happen?
---
It could be a bug but I am not sure! I don't really have walls at my camp so I can't test it!
---
I think it’s an upgrade from the water pump for sure. Just waiting til it’s on sale.
---
I’m 94 as well and I’ll be taking a bit of a break once I’ve completed it until the next season
---
Yeah I dumped all I had. 250 corks too lol
---
I’ve been collecting since they announced the event because I knew cork was going to be one if the more challenging ones. 
---
But you know what. Who cares.
---
This are the ”fixes” you get using tape lol
---
It's been like this since day one, I've given up on it being fixed or on workshops ever regaining thier usefulness.
---
If you hit directly with explosive weapons the splash damage numbers will not show up, except for the grenade launcher. Launcher generally shows 130-150 damage hits on SBQ, which lines up with my 1200ish damage numbers on normal enemies with buffs. Given she has 70% reduction that seems right.
---
Now does it compare to the 150-200 per tick I can get with the flamer? No, but at a certain point the game becomes too easy and your killing the Queen faster than people can get hits in. Explosives is far more fun and manages to easily wipe out all of the low enemies.
---
Its part of the public domain, its usednin skme commercials
---
Gotcha. Thanks for clearing it up. I'll go with Herbivore for this one and I did start a melee char again. Crap gear isn't helping but should this one get to a higher level I'll put Carnivore on that one.  
---
My main has a decent sized garden anyway.
---
All the NPCs are annoying and repetitive after a certain point. Have you ever had the wanderer ally at your camp? Jesus christ put the guitar down.
---
it's happened to me. I don't think Bethesda is going to do anything about it, but I value my account too much to risk it.
---
managed to scrap it but now I have a permanent 1% stored on my budget.
---
I like her
---
Build a grenade stand. If I can build a wall from the scraps of wood from pencils I can do this.
---
Throw the biggest damn Meat Week bash you have ever seen.
---
The blood eagles emote is the fist shake but at first I thought it was the Italian fu lol
---
Yeah theyre going to have to have some really neat rewards. I will most likely participate regardless -I did have a lot of fun with it at the start when a few dailies would get you a score level and I really like the overall idea and everything but. I definitely wanna pace myself.
---
Can't come up with a decent reply? You are proving your love of fortnite.
---
Welcome to our club, it's a hell of a realization. Just a matter of skins at this point...
---
The only time we want dupers to dupe!!!
---
You should try a nice refreshing Nukashine instead. It's the best drink in existence, the effect of which is like having your brains smashed out with a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.
---
Why does that particular item need to be permanent in comparison to other items that have previously been on the store?
---
Because it’s something you want?
---
Flawed logic there.
---
So do I. Atom bless the dupers.
---
Honestly though, the emote runs the gamut.  The character animation starts off like a "Sorry, my bad, please don't hurt me."  But then the dismissive shrug gives it that weird "Whatever" flavor.
---
I think part of the problem is that because the character faces don't change their expression while emoting, you don't get the same sympathetic cue that the little sprite animation does.
---
Really neat for sure!!
---
I’m slow and careful with my inventory management, always moving my cursor over the items I want to interact with before pressing any buttons. I’ve never deleted an item due to this. Sorry for your loss.
---
I got there and had a slightly different experience. My char was all bloodied unyielding, meaning his perception and all stats were HIGH. So, I chose the dialogue option to make the lady tell me what was going on. She explained the situation (they were forcing her to do that) and I proceeded to open the door and throw a plasma grenade with my demolition perk to the max. 
---
Room secured!
---
What about backpack mods that make perks/armor redundant? I think it's all personal preference, we should have the option.
---
Oh look at me lucky over here, all I got was wine 😂
---
I want Rose on the radio, all day every day.
---
Are you sure that it works with animated and all that jazz? If I have animated lvl 1,2 and 3 of a card and find another one of those(animated or not) from a pack,will I keep it? I doubt it and won't risk my packs for now.
---
Just love the reddit community. The random downvotes. The"git gud scrub" sheep that copy paste everywhere. WTF happened to you guys?
---
Super man: carry other players, let’s anyone however heavy they may be able to fast travel to u.
---
Had no clue they added this, I noticed some locations have changed but now I’m gonna have to re explore the entire map
---
Yeah not to mention all the posts going on at the beginning about how it "wouldn't be possible to finish on dailies alone" and all that x.x And yeah I really agree with you there - my friend definitely bought a bunch of levels after he got the auto complete bug - especially since people who submitted tickets were getting the finger about it
---
I prefer to play on a console (XBox) for the ability to have a large screen (50" TV) and one controller.  I admit like the ability to use hot keys but in the end being without does not slow me from playing with other XBox users (we just don;t know any better).  I do not see me upgrading to the newer console unless there is something that is game changing.
---
I kinda have a hunch the pipe weapons double dipping is unintentional, much like how the meat hook was. Im guessing they havent bothered fixing it because its not absurdly OP like the meathook was.
---
With that said if you did move the pistol perks to agility and they did still double dip, with your build you could take the first 2 ranks of each  damage perk  and rank 3 tank killer and get a 90% boost at 15 perception.  Still 30% more than any other weapon class. Especialy with legendary special points around the corner.  
---
Using the damage calculator comparing a junkies hardened pipe revolver  with 90% damage boost from perks  vs a  junkies western with 60%  from perks you do 225 damage with the pipe and 224 damage with the western. Now add tank killer to the mix and you do a fair amount more with the pipe revolver, plus its supressed to maintain stealth, thats FAR from being broken.
---
Something like "Operation Health" from R6S? I totally agree with you.
---
The moment I was far enough into the pass where I can skip a day or certain challenges where I don’t have to spend the extra time doing is such a relief from the constant chore of this game.
---
i found that sometimes spamming the button too quick while trying to fast travel is what does it to me.  if i encounter that bug i click the location, let the screen pop up (spend x caps to fast travel here) then wait 2-3 seconds on that menu before i click ok seems to work for me almost everytime...... but it is super annoying
---
I am a full sneak/ rifleman build on my main char. the other day my instigating lvl 45 lever was only dropping lvl 10 guys to 25% health... normally lvl 68's are one shot. i was getting so damn irritated. it only did it for that one evening but it did happen accross several servers.
---
My #1 complaint is the nerfing of building.... as long as it isnt a camp budget glitch then........ Come on.....     let us cheat in healthy non game breaking ways. it's really harf to build the bow of a ship if i cant do anything with slanted roof tiles. you dont give me any other options bathesda.
---
the way i see it ( and no it's not my pocket book, my ego isn't on the line trying to 1 up characters exploring the game's limitations) but glitches like that actually add to the game. the more there is to explore and mess with then the more enjoyable it is.
---
There's a reason I switched to Spotify IRL... No stupid DJs, no idiotic commercials running every 10 minutes, just music.
---
I'd like the ability to turn off the DJ because, quite frankly, I don't care about Julie, her brother Matty, her lack of Nuka Cola supplies, or the five minute interlude about the importance of the radio station to her life.
---
But I love shopping for ivory grips!
---
Truly, the *Walk Hard* of horror movies.
---
with that perk (+2500), 15 strength (+75), and the strongback perk (+40), you get an additional 2615 carry weight. that doesn't include what you could get with unyielding, +1 strength, mutations, or backpack mods that you could stack on to each other. now that would be a legendary perk I would love to have
---
Lvl 89 out of a 100 and I just want it to be over with . Usually a level a day and a couple on the weekend but honestly instead of a two week break in between legendary runs I wish it was more like two months . Not looking forward to the next one at all !
---
Yeah at the end of the day it doesn't bother me. It's just funny. Kinda wish it was more real and we could see our contributions.
---
Yeah, it's asking too much.
---
Considering the group has supposedly been traveling for a long time, I'd say it's safe to assume they don't have a squadron of vertibirds at their disposal to just be giving joyrides to wastelanders but I dunno. 
---
First thought is really that the Pitt is most likely candidate for first expansion since they specifically made sure to have a few of NPCs mention it and there's the pathway directly from the Monongahela river in 76 and we saw the same river as part of the dlc in fo3.
---
Both flow into the Ohio River so that's also possible we get our first real look at East Central Commonwealth with more of the Zetans.
---
I think that's one situation where putting on a stealth suit and hiding within the workshop area to take it back over is warranted.
---
Understandable! During the first couple weeks of it, I was logging in every single day after work and would play till bedtime. There were also some off days were I played probably 8-10 hours in a single day. After doing that for 2 weeks, I had to make myself stop playing so much because I was definitely feeling the burn out/monotony of the game. 
---
Overall, by playing the way I do now maybe 3-4 hours overall during the work week, and maybe 8-10 over the weekend), I’m doing okay with the game and haven’t wanted/needed a break from it (yet). 
---
I think I’m level 62 on the board at the moment. Whether that means I’m on track to complete the season, I don’t know, but the only other plans I’m looking forward to are the firefly in a jar and the chicken coop. I *think* I can get those, at least.
---
I just checked the counter to see if they lowered it and came here to say exactly that 😂😂
---
You only find her annoying and repetitive because there's only like 12 songs on the radio for her to announce/comment on. If they expanded the music selection and gave her some more lines, things would improve
---
Just did this the other day too; Jeepers Creepers, so long my pearly peepers! Also, 🎶🎵 so long Dental Plan!!! 🎶🎵
---
The mysterious puppers.
---
and then please also put valuable loot in said toilets so I can try and pick them up and then misclick and just throw toilet water in my face
---
MIRV is an absolute joke. Can’t shoot beyond 100ft, and you can’t even VATS it to make them home in on targets. Nothing better than watching a pair of mini nukes from my TS Fatman, follow Scorchbeasts out of weapons range for a minute, before blowing them out of the sky, lol.
---
Each of them has an effect that should not be possible.  
---
Some are as simple as more range, some are as egregious as firing mini nukes at full auto, using 5mm ammo.
---
Yep, allows me to relax and tune out of real world shit.  Whip out my magic shotgun and watch the meat explosions 🤣
---
Fortunately I bought that one from a player vendor cuz I got bored during Bennett's questline lol
---
I'll just go back and do it myself no problem 
---
Really would rather I get lucky and get dropped a FFR or Junkies LMG but I only seem to get medics if I get an LMG at all haha
---
I was selling them for 5 caps at first, then I found out it's a way too common item and just dumped everything in a trash container xD
---
Yeah I didn't think about that but as other people have brought up it is good for new characters or people leveling new characters. I never even thought to switch and grab it on one of my low levels. I am glad they are helpful to some people &lt;3
---
Now get on in there and clean up yo camp boy!!
---
Can yall motherfucks not be happy with anything? Bethesda is trying, give them a break.
---
(AC does suck though, I'll give you that).
---
Haha I don't blame you. Did you end up buyin it out or just sayin to hell with it?
---
Oh didn’t know. Thanks for sharing
---
I throw them in the air, looks like fireworks and sounds like a centaur making sweet love to a brahmin "uuuhhuuuuhhhh" "oohhhuuuhhh" "hhhuuuoooooooo"
---
Yeah that's totally valid :)
---
Also riding shotgun
---
I’ve had fallout 1st for almost a year and I only had 700 some cork. But I never have truly went searching for special junk other then lead. But after almost 800 hours played and 600 of those hours came from around time I got fallout 1st I only had 780 or so. I only donated once just like I donated once for concrete but donated about ten times for steel until I realized there was no point.
---
F
---
It's where the final boss lives.
---
I just wish all stuff would display properly. Commendations sink 100% into the display, lots of things are half sunk in and some stuff like atom shop hats can't even be put in one. I wanted to display a bunch of black bear mascot suit heads but RIP to that idea.
---
You’re on xbox?  Can I get a perma-invite for these 6-9 queens a day?
---
Nope me either! They're more precious than bouillon to me!
---
Both of my replies are movie quotes from Big Lebowski
---
What has cork other than golf balls and base balls?
---
Thanks, good luck with those 127 rounds you bought, when you run low I have 15k rounds for sale. Happy hunting!
---
I think so, yes. I reasonably often see raider thieves when fast travelling to Camden Park, and I think they still can drop the Osmosis Kit or Portable Power Pack (which are Misc and not Junk and so can't get scrapped accidentally) even if you don't have the quest active.
---
Couldn’t tell you. I’m just going off of the patch notes.
---
If you have the cannibal perk, you can talk to them and threaten to eat them and they all run away, terrified.
---
Look up atomic shop music on Spotify. Some dude made a playlist.
---
Razorgrain soup is the ultimate convenience food.
---
Super easy to make from things at your CAMP, and replenishes water
---
Yeah I really hope they will bring back the atoms because that was a better incentive for me. I really like a lot of things that were in the run but a good bulk of it I won't ever use. Like the atomic power armor paints or the ghillie skins for armor etc.
---
Ha, I was a WoW daily player back in the day as well, when 80 was the max.  I remember the honor grind - not wanting to lose rank each week - wearing me down, until I stopped PvPing in the game and just did PvE.  I finally bailed when Cataclysm came out - loaded it up, jumped on my Rustbound Drake, flew around Orgrimmar for a minute, then logged off and never went back lol.  For me learning the new mechanics with every new WoW release was the audit point - when Cataclysm came out I remember they reworked a lot of mechanics, so it would’ve meant learning how to play my class all over, then re-optimizing my build around that, and I just couldn’t be bothered.
---
 I'm currently lvl 280 and I've been leveling up 2 sometimes 3 levels a day (it's fair to say that if I'm not off my face on berry mentats regular mentats and daddy'o's its not a regular day)
---
People have been asking for this since post launch. You can still see the workarounds theyve done on some of the bugs. Like the delay they added to ”fix” the slow engine. 😂 
---
Some ppl still claim they havnt seen any bugs, wtf are they doing? One might wonder.
---
They need to fix them so they cover the left eye, not the right one.
---
same
---
I create a new character and just run towards the wayward, killing everything that is in front of me, discovering 2 or 3 locations on the way, and finish the first quest in the wayward. takes maybe 15-20 minutes max to level up. I have been doing that almost every day to get the level up challenge complete. 
---
it is so much easier and faster to do that instead of grinding for a level when I am already 285
---
or how she cleared space for dancing
---
The outfit you get from siding with the raiders also has a blood pack on it.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fashionable_raider_outfit
---
I see this posted every week! Stop! Bethesda knows.
---
I'll literally join a team just to fast travel to their camp to cut costs.
---
Can you loot it? On a serious note, is a bow build viable?
---
To be fair I’ve played since drop date and never once complained or asked for anything in person or in a public forum about the game. I love the game, however, I feel like there are a few things that lack considering the game was supposedly built off fallout 4 core and I’m not sure I believe Bethesda is “trying”.  How long has Skyrim been out now?  Across how many consoles? And yet here I still see terrain clipping and missing textures.
---
Half of me wishes for safe and stable game play. 
---
The other half knows that should Beth fix their bugs, the CAMP system would be boring as shit... The glitches are the reason I enjoy designing my camp.
---
Lmao. Nobody duped cork. I actually was amusing myself by asking a few dupers I know about their junk numbers.. the vast majority could finish the steel and plastic BY THEMSELVES. 
---
When it comes to cork? Only one person out of the 9 I asked had more than 350. No, that's not missing any zeros, most had 200-250. 
---
I'm not sure why everyone seems to think dupes are prevalent. Here's the thing with dupes: if there is an active dupe, either two people know or everyone knows. But "dupers" are probably worse off in this category than the average player. That 63 mil number is hilarious and I can assure you, it's not "duped" cork.
---
Oh I didn’t kno, thx!
---
I’m using the starlet sniper hat! :)
---
Yeah I remember that.. I played in BC and left for a little bit and came back for Cata.. I played thru til.. the Iron Horde came out - then my guild kind of bottomed out and we all went our separate ways and I just lost interest sadly.
---
While I agree money talks, do you think that if they start to see a steep unsubscribe or less new subscribers to 1st, the executives would say, 'whelp, onto the next thing' and just throw the whole thing in maintenance only mode?
---
I think we're all sort of trapped in a not-so-popular world that's getting moderate to low attention due to the age of the title... I wonder if the quantity of bugs present took the wind out of the sails of the backbone staffing of 76.
---
Then again, I'm still here logging in after multiple disconnects and straight-to-desktop shutdowns after the latest patch, oh well!
---
Oh I love that
---
would love when they show up he is like "i didn't think you were real"  gets killed and the brotherhood starts trying to find ways to help the players. maybe a Vertibird grenade that you can use that will guarantee one will come help you in a fight.  or maybe free travel to a few different spots that they will take over.
---
You're "seeing them for sale" but the background of every picture is a mule's stash box?
---
Sounds like we could build our own vaults. Let me do that, you can have my atoms.
---
Hey the Firefly Jar and the Chicken coop and the hanging tree were my top  favorite rewards honestly. I hope you're able to get them
---
I 100% agree and that is why I get bored of the game. Sadly, the only way I can play and get shots on the legendaries is to do private server but that is not as fun since my friends no longer play the game (so I would be alone).
---
Also: enemy types need to come as mixed groups that work together to challenge the player. For example, when you get attacked by scorched you just get...a lot of scorched. Some will run at you, others hit cover and shoot. I’d much prefer a “battle group” that uses scorched animals to act as a screen whilst the human scorched set up in cover with grenade launchers and rifles to suppress and pick off PC’s. At higher levels a SB will circle overhead to provide devastating fire support. 
---
Point being, I’d like encounters to be challenging not because my enemies have more HP and damage but because they have unit composition and tactics that you have to break down and overcome.
---
Yes. I play from 9 pm to 4 am central for three days a week, then most of the days for the rest of the week.
---
I hope you will like it - Grahm is one of my favorite characters in the whole game so it's always a plus for me
---
Please report back if it works. I had the same thing happen to me a few days ago, except I was lucky enough that a quit to menu and rejoin fixed it and even preserved my loot bag (because I fortunately was in a team and thus joined back to the same world).
---
Ah cool hadn't heard of that before,  were is that picked up?
---
Yes I want a jack in the box that giggles and drops a live grenade!
---
Because the concrete fiasco blew up in their face, of course they wouldn't want that to happen again.
---
Legendary monsters are legit trash anyways in terms of being "legendary" they should have way bigger health pools so that other people can get some damage in.
---
No because i need this agility for AP and it's was like that since the first fallout to have light/small weapons in the agility special category or related, and actually when i'm playing as commando i have 5pts for adrenaline perk.
---
I prefer to have a full perk buff for dmg.
---
no different than the other fallout DJs imo.
---
people love to praise Three Dog and Mr New Vegas but they get just as repetitive and annoying if you leave the radio on 24/7.
---
They kept it for less than an hour and then the retake quest popped up for me, can't get enough concrete in an hour to do much and it wasn't a daily to take a workshop that day, so I think it was just to be a jerk
---
I've encountered this a few times myself, it's absolutely bizarre to come across.
---
Bethesda
---
ESO *is* great. It's also built with a completely different engine, by a completely different studio.
---
I'm a stealth rifleman vat-y build about lvl150.  Here is my current build.  It is sub-optimal for damage as I have some quality-of-life perks instead. I can 1shot most enemies except for the big bullet sponges.  I can easily switch over to commando if I want. I also don't really need the scaly skin mutation anymore bc I am using secret service armor now.  I used the Garb of Mysteries for a looong time bc of the stealth bonus and the fact that it doesn't need repair. I switched to the CSS around lvl 100 and then eventually secret service with the jetpack. (hence the need for white knight lvl3)

If you still need gold, visit Smiley. There’s a quick -6k caps.
---
I’ve been playing since the day the game come out and I’ve only had like 1300 cork in total
---
Yeah same here - and to me it's fun and interesting to see how people play NW so differently. One of my friends actively uses terminals to hunt down players very aggressively - but others I know just follow the line of the fire so they can get the drop on whoever is left at the end- always moving and tactically hiding haha.  Personally I am a bit in between. But yes I was really glad they added dailies for NW for those of us that enjoy NW and I hope they will add more rewards for leveling there soon honestly. Like more camp items and things &lt;3
---
There is a difference between everyday camp abominations and this... This has purpose and design and my pristine villages and retreats would be happy to have a neighbor like this.
---
Showing my age this is like the fallout version of sanford and sons to me 😆
---
They did say they moved it at one point, just don't remember where they moved it to.
---
Yes, but caveat: a balance pass on all weapons, armour and legendary effects so that we have more viable build diversity (once everything is fixed ofc).
---
Says the dude who trolls for Trump and uses words like “Kek”... 
---
Holy hell the irony and projection...
---
Once you go bloodied unyielding it’s all a bit academic.  Let’s me explain.   With just a 1* bloodied gauntlet you will one hit everything on the game (besides the queen and colossus).  I still don’t have the DCG with +1 strength but one day.....
---
Will do when i can log in again!
---
But what's this got to do with Smash?!

This may contribute but it's certainly not the player's issue.
---
I have dropped every single note/holo that I can and it doesn't matter. My game freezes for half a second for every item I craft which really slows down mass-crafting.
---
Pipe weapons
---
I’m seeing more bashing on them for the current cork numbers than I did for them changing the quota on concrete. Concrete was only a problem for most people when it was clear we couldn’t reach the goal.
---
So close!!
---
Daily Ops *might* fix this. Emphasis on the *might*.
---
And balancing weapons and damage...
---
Thats the story I want to hear, gives me hope that I can return to my gaming roots eventually. I never enlisted like all my friend but I did become an aircraft mechanic and did get to do some work for the usaf and uscg working on the hercs.
---
So 0?
---
Nioce
---
Not thinking about the leveling, and just enjoying the game helps. If burnt out, take a break from the grind &amp; give your time to something more refreshing
---
How do you know people are mad?
---
I was thinking about this same combo. Wish I'd bought the mask
---
Yeah.  I mostly scrap everything for scrip. For when that fiddy percent event begins
---
Honestly, WoW was my only true MMO experience. Which that’s been ages ago now, but still happy to see it around.
---
If I remember correctly, it moved to a location slightly east of Atlas.
---
I remember getting an instigating fatman, before the explosive nerf and pvp damage cap, and thinking it would one shot someone since it did over 2k damage without the instigating effect. I shot a level 40 wanted player twice with it only to switch weapons so I could actually drop him.
---
Maybe i'll actually use it, then.   
---
I tend to spam collect water from streams to boil. (xp and crap to sell)  
---
All my purified water goes to diluting stims and such.
---
The dynamite bundles are pretty hype tho
---
That on you bro , don’t blame Bethesda because your playing the game how it isn’t designed 
---
Dailies were designed to be casual for the casual player
---
Actually, that's why I created the second character in the first place - so I could go in different directions and enjoy the content...now that I have two viable characters, I bounce between the two and try to have a good time.
---
It helps that I'm writing a Fallout 76 novel - so gaming is important for content.
---
You should! There's a few that don't really require you to play the mode. 
---
You could log in and spawn in the middle of no where and place your camp 3 times and leave the match. 
---
Need to kill another player? Grab a friend (or someone from reddit) - set your team to no fill so you both are solo - set up a spawn location and kill each other. 
---
Revive a player? Join a team with your new friend and build a floor and some stairs - jump off and get revived and repeat! In NW no stimpack is required to revive &lt;3
---
We're mad at the rewards more than anything
---
Defending a workshop should either be 1 wave of enemies or an endless swarm you need to defend against for 2 minutes.
---
I believe technically, yes they could. But honestly, with the recent wave of bans and unbans, who knows how the nerf ban hammer will swing on this one.
---
We used to, that's why I have like 30 of em saved up. I used to always get the same animated card over and over but it still only showed the one. I stopped after I noticed that.
---
I know it’s a game, but if you look into real life silencers for revolvers, there’s only a handful of designs ever made that functioned with one, and they weren’t very popular. Instead of doing more suppressors in-game, how about adding other attachments like laser sights, a flashlight that would replace pipboy light when equipped, muzzle breaks and compensators, speed loaders, etc. 
---
I definitely think dual wielding should be an option, with the downside of being hip-fire only for close range gunfights.
---
When it says level up in NW - the best thing to do is to hop on any character that hasn't played NW and level that one. So for most dailies I play on my main who is like 130something but for the level up overseer ranks I hop on my like level3 that way it's easier :)
---
Oh okay i see that firing mini nukes at full auto is not healthy for this game.
---
I thought they only have more range than normal weapons.
---
Thank you for the reply!
---
Why would you block?  Genuine question
---
I actually really like her. She sounds like she has her own story we'll never see.
---
So many “returning players” would come back if they saw a trailer that depicted dual wielding guns/weapons
---
I bought the raider collectron on the atom shop but I can't find it anywhere in my CAMP menus... Where is it? It said in Resources but there's nothing there but a brhamin cart.... 😑 Do I have to buy the regular collectron and the raider is just a skin or...? 🤔
---
"potentially"
---
To be fair, the double score weekend is wanted alot more by alot more people than the flag was from the concrete.
---
Well, they got bashed on the entire time, not just after they lowered it to 15 mil from 150 mil.
---
They may have inflated numbers to try and prevent that.
---
Whether the current number is real or not, it just seems odd.
---
I don't recall the single day tally for steel, but I'd expect that steel was around the same value after one day, and steel was completely plausible to reach that value. Cork, not so much.
---
Now... if they had logs showing turn-in, minus names of course, then i'd be more trusting, not completely, but more trusting.

What about other cosmetics such as the Raider skinner hood which makes you bald and the VTU baseball hat which was glitched in the wastelanders update to appear as a plain red hat?
---
Fallout DJs suck now. Three dog and Mr. New Vegas were it
---
this question is confusing
---
Ya this one is ridiculous. I eventually got it working, one try will probably ***not*** be enough lol. I Exited to the main menu and logged into another adventure world ***about 5 times to get it working***. Once I got into the new world, I analyzed the blood FIRST then placed the fuse like people here have been saying.
---
I should also note that on my attempt that worked all the ***doors in the hospital were CLOSED (I had to open them all while making my way to the lab)***. On all the attempts that failed they were open (not sure if that is a clue to if your attempt is going to work but thought I should mention it).
---
I should also note that every time ***another actual player was around or in the same building*** it did not work. I'm guessing it might have to do with them already trying that portion of the quest while you're instanced in with them? I don't know lol.
---
***TL;DR Just try logging out and back in multiple times, and analyze blood FIRST then the fuse. It eventually worked for me after 5 tries.***
---
Edit: My platform is PC
---
A little disappointing to hear, but I appreciate the update!
---
They could fix this by giving us a recon tagger mod for the Camera.  We've already got the 200 mm lens which gives the zoom, now give the recon tagging option that the Peepers have, and you don't need anything more.  Make it a BOS Plan we can learn.
---
I killed the lady but left her husband since he was too out of it to notice I killed his wife
---
9
---
I strongly agree with no 1, it's even be happy if each vending machine had a weight limit instead. I also agree with the point about shop previews, the buttons there it just does nothing.
---
As for the armour/pa,  it'll say raider power, t-&lt;model number&gt; or xo1, ultracite etc. There isn't armour pieces in the game with the same name. A lot of that will just be learning, but it'll become second nature over time. I dont know why you'd be buying armour in the first place though, craft it!
---
For the last point, you can rename weapons and armour, i have each chassis named for whatever pa it holds. Ultracite pa, the pa etc.
---
Lastly, if you're making a numbered list, you may want to go higher than 1 number :D
---
Good ol' Tucker and Dale; love that movie!
---
There's supposed to be another double score so you might wait it out you know?
---
I throw them straight up and use them as fireworks at events.
---
Ahhahaha ignorance is bliss
---
From my perspective - leveling is something that happens by accident.  And pretty quickly.
---
leveling post 100, each level is 15,880
---
Between sleeping in a bed + exp boost food (and mutation) - I have a 25% boost.  Roughly 15-16 int as well.
---
Killing a level 68 mutant in west-tek nets 239 exp.  Killing the 1 or 2 slothbeasts that spawn at my camp door (lucked out on that) - each net high 200s/low 300.   
---
My point being... that 15k exp is basically 67 level 68 super mutants.  So is you can farm west-tek / other high level mobs, it takes no time at all.  
---
With fallout first (and private servers), it's no question.  I have a 15 minute-ish run I'll do that nets about half of a level.
---
Some people hate this game and will complain about anything. Some people see no personal benefit from the rewards so they get pissed. Unfortunately, that's just how some people are.
---
Huh I suppose so. I wish the banner was a wall flag lol
---
Nah, you can.  The both of you just need to know each other's name to be able to add each other via the Social Menu (entry field at the bottom of your list of friends).
---
Technically no rather.
---
Can you be banned if your friend give you 4 stimpacks that turn out to have be duped?
---
I only had like 800 cork in my 600ish hours of gameplay.
---
 **Perk Card Packs:** Fixed a bug preventing some Perk Cards from appearing in Perk Card Packs.   
---
Hmm, I understood it as there were certain Cards that were not appearing at all in the Perk Packs. Now those certain cards should be included as a possibility when you open packs.
---
Id like something fancy. Just hit lvl 50 and am severely underpowered
---
Yeah that's crazy. I've also had it happen a whole bunch in the river bed just outside the Black Bear Lodge.
---
I found that selling unscrapped junk is easy money early on. Go somewhere and grab everything you see, flower pots, brooms, everything. Don’t scrap it... instead go sell each junk item to a vendor for 1-3 caps each. That might get you the caps you need for now. Selling cooked meat is also good low level money. Eventually you’ll be selling guns you find for caps. That’s the real money maker.
---
check the atom shop on the 13th
---
It’s not. Zero reports of anyone getting banned or bethesda caring about this. They’ve had time to patch it and haven’t. Only ones that care are the white knights of this sub
---
Its the only way to shoot the fixer.  Fixer has terrible recoil aiming down site.
---
&gt; At level 538,
---
I don't understand this comment;  level 100+ is the exact same exp, no ?
---
While there are a bunch of cosmetics that I loved like the white skull mask and the black cosmic power armor -  I would much rather have different kinds of cosmetics vs "here's the same cosmetic 6 times but on different items"
---
Np man if you need help with what perks to use or gear let me no
---
Donate that cork to the cause man!
---
There’s already nothing to do so why not
---
I had a thousand cork in my box, so it's not as unreasonable as it may seem if people just kept stowing it.
---
Who knows....
---
Clearly you are saying you are able to get those duplicate cards which I think is intentional given the direction legendary perks are going.
---
They are only changing it so that the sparkly moving cards won't award extra points.
---
Same, and being a low level is so much more challenging than being at endgame. It feels like fallout 4 survival mode again, have to craft, sneak, and approach each area with a plan. TBH, way more fun than mindlessly blasting through silos and waiting for the queen to land. Make a new character for sure!
---
Oh I didn't know about that one I'll have to check out hemlock holes awesome thanks buddy
---
Me too. Following
---
exactly. it really bugs me how people assume all games under the same publisher are done by the same team.
---
On the official Bethesda website it says each EARLY tier can be obtained in around one hour, and LATER tiers closer to two hours. 
---
I wager this probably took you WAY longer than what they are pitching. Can you confirm my thoughts lol? I have a few weeks off soon and want to know how much time I would have to sink into the grind to complete it. 
---
Thanks! :)
---
Lol you are right about the list, I was struggling with reddit's markdown. 
---
And yes the name issue is about getting used to stuff, but it's extremely useful for newer players.
---
Or how about an actual drop/trading lock option that we can just arbitrarily apply to items?
---
We've needed something like that from the beginning.  It's awful that we're all just a couple misclicks away from losing precious gear we grinded for days/weeks/months to get.
---
And some people just assign themselves as Bethesda cheerleaders and make out nobody should ever have a problem with anything FO76 related.
---
Unfornatually thats just how some people are. Its cringe to have to read but you need to work your way through such nonsense to get to the actual posts.
---
I have a serious question. How do you know that the devs are required to play this game? If you’re referring to people like Valseek and Devann, they aren’t devs
---
Inspect doesn't work when viewing stuff in other people's shops, at least in the Windows Store (PC) version.
---
I tend to rename important stuff to place them at the top or at the bottom of the inventory. It helps a lot.
---
That’s a bummer. :(
---
If in doubt, Google it beforehand. I've played every fallout game up until name and I've been playing 76 for maybe 3 weeks and I'm still learning new stuff. Thats what I do every time.
---
absolutely. it's got nothing to do with the fact the rewards for an absurd amount of junk are trash.
---
it's just gamers being entitled, am I right?
---
As long as we're throwing out skin ideas, I want a Chameleon backpack skin that makes it invisible. I can't give up that carry weight, but sometimes a visible backpack doesn't go with my outfit.
---
That was my point though. They know people didn’t expect cork to make it on here and the complaints more or less turned to begrudging praise for Bethesda just lowering the quota. Seems like they should’ve just lowered the quota again instead of faking the numbers like everyone assumed they would. Seemed like it worked out much better for them with concrete. 
---
I can’t say for certain on cork. There are enough common things to get it from that it’s possible, they just aren’t popular scrappables like golf balls and pipe weapons. I’m not saying Bethesda didn’t lie, just that I buy this one a bit more than if concrete’s numbers were inflated. I guess that could be what they’re hoping for though.
---
I suspect we'll see mannequins, power armor displays, and similar resource-hungry CAMP objects as options for the instanced CAMP interiors.
---
Thank you for this. You helped me dodge a bullet.
---
I thought I was the only one doing this. Not only do you get the task reduced to a single wave, it usually means that they’ll be more likely to spawn near to the actual workshop instead of being a stupid “find the hiding molerat” hunt.
---
I’d be ok if they at least marked all the enemies from the start instead of having to kill most of them to trigger that location tracker.
---
You'd think....but there is no way that's accurate anymore. Because I did 8 Encryptid (for at least 2500 XP Per) &amp; a Queen where I received over 4000 and I am less than 50% of the way to the next level.
---
As proof, I received the 10K+ XP bonus SCORE points at least 6 times....that's 60,000 XP, and yet I didn't level up.
---
I feel like Red Dead Online and Fallout 76 are secretly being worked on behind the scenes by the same idiots.
---
And I’m also an idiot because I keep playing both and hoping each new patch will make the game great.
---
you would have to sell it cheaper than in game vendors do..
---
Tedious is the best word for it. I can level pretty fast, but I get tired of farming the same old spots everyday.
---
You could run something like this and use the legendary agklity perk to make up the 2 points in agility (only 20 AP). At 13 agil, shielded road leathers,bird bones and unylieding your pushing 35 agility, thats a ton.but gotta imaging the 15 perception is the rifle,pistol and tAnk killer perks.
---

---
With a bloodied build youre already doing a shit load of damage. Like 2k + a sneaky head shot i dont think that 30% would hinder you at all. It would still one hit everything and do like 50 less damage to the sbq. 
---
I get the light arms in agility thinking.  But not being able to take damage and sneak skills at the same time,  let alone any of the weapon specific perks hinders handgun users. 
---
Also edited my previous comment with damage number comparison, not sure if you saw that.
---
Hmm well towards the end it required several days of dailies to actually fill the bar and it really depended on how lucky I would get with the bigger events that I was using to make the most out of my XP. I thin it's going to be a little different for everyone based on their playstyle /whether or not you have a dedicated group of people who have the same goals as you etc. 
---
I have a good group of people who were dedicated to the grind too - so that's all of us on a building team / lunchboxed up / well fed / well rested / XP  boost food - the lot you know? Doing the repeatable is really easy if you do events like radiation rumble where it's just endless ghouls or the bugged line in the sand where all the scorched spawn in the middle and you just spray and pray in the middle and soak up the XP etc.
---
There are some events like uranium fever for example that always spawn legendary mobs (the event I mentioned above spawns 3 legendary mobs) and playing those on public server is stupid since people often do not let everyone get a hit in. Public teams help since if 1 of your team gets a hit on the mob you will get loot but that requires your other team members to join and that isnt always possible. Worse is when its the SBQ run and there are overpowered people who kill it in seconds preventing average people from getting loot since they didnt have enough time to deal the damage needed to get it. I did a encryptid (probally misspelled) event earlier using my keycard and was unable to loot the imposter sheepsquach  (also possibly misspelled) because it died within 1 second after becoming vulnerable. They should make it so when a legendary mob dies anyone within a set distance gets loot from it regardless if they had time to hit it or not.
---
I haven't seen a lot of them in action, but some fire their normal rounds like a shotgun instead which means they do eight times the damage. Others have hidden effects which aren't reflected in the stats (like always having 100% VATS or never consuming durability).
---
Fudged without a doubt. Bethesda's just not allowing their event to fail to save face.
---
&gt; work my ass off for more 
---
[Oh wait your serious?](https://youtu.be/_n5E7feJHw0)
---
You put minimal work in this game to get those items.
---
Cork can be found scrapping multiple things. Concrete, not so much.For example, ff you've gone screws farming, odds are you've been picking up a fair bit of cork as a byproduct of globes. Or plastic farming golf balls.
---
\[Edit\] Why the downvote? I'm not saying it isn't sketch. Just pointing out cork is a lot more available compared to concrete.
---
I always liked the idea of the community challenges where it’s like kill X# of scorch or SBQ. It’s a lot more doable and allows everyone to consistently participate.
---
I'm probably selling trash, but nothing overpriced.
---
Using a slow swing speed weapon you can animation cancel. Allowing you to swing just as fast while being protected some of the time. Plus it staggers enemys that hit you which can be helpful for preserving your armor.
---
I ran into the truck stop and was hiding from a bunch of super mutants and there was the port o diner right next to me, of course I had to try it a couple of times.  No, luck though.
---
That actually makes a lot of sense.  Thanks!
---
I mean, I run a two handed melee build on my main. She has a handful of mutations, but she's not a bloodied or junkie build (no specific build really). Just kind of vibing with an instigating grognak axe and vanguard secret service armor. I one shot pretty much any enemy I come across, short of a scorch beast (takes a few swings) and the SBQ of course. Definitely more than just tickling enemies though. The game is still enjoyable. 😂
---
I will share mine, just give me a bit to put it together and I will post reply.
---
Yeah, this lovely summer getaway was built at the Beckley Mine Exhibit.
---
"Anyone else feel like this is a really fudged number?"
---
A quick scan of the subreddit shows that many people feel that way.
---
I sort by weight when I start throwing stuff out, so that won't help me unfortunately
---
The rewards. If I just wanted a bunch of alcohol I’d go server hop a bunch to do One Violent Night.
---
You must be mistaken because it has been a daily challenge literally every single day.
---
Like I said, alot of conflicting or outdated information. Unsure what's fully "right" at this point
---
If everyone announced why, I'm sure it would. 
---
It's a lot easier and cheaper to work on a project continuously than it is to make a new one. They bought Austin or Dallas, forgot which, to work on fo76.
---
You get it as part of the mission where you gain the ability to launch nukes.
---
Why not ? Works that good?
---
One of the issues with pistols is that because it sits in Agility it preludes equipping stealth perks, and for a lot of content in this game stealth is such a force multiplier in terms of damage output and defense: stealth commando is top-tier because of this.
---
Rather than make handguns viable because you can play them stealthy I’d much prefer giving them their own definitive play style and flavour, and for me that would be the “stand and deliver” critical hit machine. So:
---
-Pistol damage perks go into Perception. Pistol support perks go to Agility.
---
-New Perk: “True Grit”. Agility. Three ranks. Whenever you score a critical hit against a target (not restricted to VATS) you gain 10% damage resist for 60s per rank. Additional critical hits refresh duration.
---
-New Perk: “Hammer it Home”. Agility. One rank. When firing in VATS, your pistols gain 25% bonus to both RoF and reload speed.
---
-Altered Perk: Modern Renegade. Agility. Three ranks. Critical hits ignore 25% armour and have 25% chance to cripple per rank.
---
New Pistol: Plasma Defender. Personal request, it was always my go-to weapon in NV.
---
Whitesprings is a good spot as it has a lot of variety there.
---
No way, take a low level.and try and tag all the ads, great way to power level a new character
---
While true, I don't think I've met anyone who even has more than 1000 cork to donate in the first place. Seriously, ask a few people you encounter today how much cork they have and/or if they donated any. The answers you'll get will make it clear that either Bethesda misplaced a decimal or they think we're all idiots.
---
I don't think Aradesh was even born yet at this point.
---
Someone on here posted a while back that scarecrows can aggro burrowing enemies, I tried it, it doesn't work 100% of the time but I feel like it's better than nothing for now.
---
Yeah found that out but I’m on Xbox so I’m out of luck of getting it lol
---
Have never came across the plan, can you purchase it from a vendor?
---
That would be filled within a few days
---
Yes but unless you do the repeatable - the dailies do not award enough to complete the run on it's own without doing the repeatable which is why I grinded it out. I'm not saying that I didn't contribute to my own burn out - but I do think they need to make some changes to make that seem less necessary next time. If they upped the amount of score you get or just add other ways to earn score - like from events or other activities - I think it would be better just by changing that. There's a few people who seem to think I don't like the run or that I don't think it was worth it and that's just not the case. But just because I enjoyed it doesn't mean I don't think that there are things that can be changed to make them more enjoyable. Plus there are plenty of people - in this thread alone - who are too far behind because they missed days and now won't be able to complete it unless they grind the repeatable. What about all the people that got auto-completed and therefore missed out on dailies - so again - can't do that casual completion. There's room for improvement there.

👀👀👀
---
Ah man gotta check my stash then a friend ran me through that originally and I didn't get to read everything at the time.
---
This does sound kind of nice but I think having it more of a niche, like giving it a longer more significant stagger effect would be a cool option for a perk too like "Your slugs now stagger enemys longer and more often!" with a few ranks so you could end up being able to stagger for maybe a second and a half
---
Additionally just various "support" versions would be cool as I imagine you could fill that slug with something of the wasteland
---
Generally just increasing damage and accuracy wouldn't be too great as their use would be contested by other rifles unless you just want some versatility in a shotgun build (I think they need buffs in general though)
---
Allies are basically mannequins atm haha
---
Sounds like you're getting staggered. Heavy weapons with spin up barrels do the same thing when you get staggered
---
if she has a story well never see than I shouldn't have to hear about it or how music is the cure to her otherwise depressing life
---
FAST. TRAVEL. BUG.
---
And also obsessed with getting them.
---
Threeeeeeee Dawwg
---
I know they CAN aggro normal enemies, not sure about burrowing. If we’re talking about workshops still, plant a few crops. You know they’ll go after those
---
Its expensive but orbital strike beacons still do damage
---
Oh heck yes
---
Look for the green ship.  Your orange ship needs to be ahead
---
Same applies
---
If reporting someone who used an exploit at a workshop under my name is being a white knight, then I'll happily be the shiniest of knights.
---
Throw in some plans I already know and you have yourself a deal
---
Our New Republic has gone missing, and by missing I mean they dont exist yet, I need you to bring it back to us, we'll even pay you
---
Doubt many people are actually mad. Most just see it as a rather clever way to lessen the amount of duped materials that a lot of players are sitting on. But also, the amount of farming necessary is nowhere near worth the award. I mean I’ve donated every day and I can’t tell you what the awards are because either I didn’t need ir or already had too much of it, and likely dropped most of it.
---
That is where I bought my concrete to get my 250 to contribute!
---
I'm going on a plastic farming run today to get ready for next week. Cork was so difficult, Bolton Greens helped (there are a bunch of gold balls on a table in the back) but I finally went on a scorched-hunting run for pipe guns that scrap cork to finally get to the 250.
---
It is the 'higher ups' and the $ in their eyes, but people canceling fo1st wont change that.  Its part of capitalism.  FWIW I've been a product design engineer for 35 years.  Those bean counters and stuffed shirts have got to make it look like their worth those 6 figures, you know, so they do something for the sake of doing it.  Reminds me of something Plato said... Wise men speak because they have something to say; Fools because they have to say something.   That's why 'design by committee' is so bad. Theoretically everyone contributes their expertise.  That's not how it works all the time, especially in poorly managed companies.
---
only one? lol
---
red dead. outer worlds.
---
Thanks for the reply! I guess we'll see what happens then lol. They should definitely maintain a challenge with their seasons in the future but I feel they should rework it a bit.
---
Well I did think of that but it happens if I just walk forward even with no enemys nearby.
---
EDIT: you can also see that as I am going in, in the video I mentioned where I am not sure where to upload it
---
Hmmmm how about a basketball hoop plan? Very rare!
---
I’ll just wait a week and wait for you to reduce it to 25 each.
---
During Quake con in an interview they specifically said the devs were required to log hours playing the game and they were also encouraged to play during breaks and even when not at work to familiarize themselves with the game.
---
Use Atoms to advance any Ranks?
---
No it is definitely not the exact same xp. The xp requirement increases each level.
---
manually updated once a day, and the people updating it apparently take sundays off (which there isnt anything wrong with that, just an observation based on this event and last year's schorched one). so i really wouldnt take the bar as an accurate measurement, more like a daily ballpark idea of what's left to do.
---
I've been trained by Fallout... I visited that place after Wastelanders with a friend, surprised a bit to find a woman there. But she was acting nervous and sketchy. And there were locked doors. So I said. "Yup, they're cannibals here." And of course I spent the night.
---
Which reminds me that I need to bring my cannibal character around to see if there is any extra dialog options. I kind of doubt it though... Nobody seems to care that much in 76 about cannibalism even if they talk about the Gourmands. I can chow down on a settler in the middle of Foundation and Samuel is just "Boy I could go for a sandwich right about now."
---
Sorry bud but the town will be done by then and you’ll have no reward :(
---
It’s really how far Bethesda has capability and desire to enforce terms of service, isn’t it? And personal conscience for the gray space between. I respect OP not wanting his owned workshop having a team member using a blueprint exploit.
---
Are you also going to give us double score and double xp weekends?
---
Concrete is farmable at workshops, it’s a lot easier to get then cork
---
Ah hah!
---
My 35 atlas boxes says otherwise
---
At least the Bots on Parade event you only need to keep the bots safe. The event succeeds as long as the bots are OK when they finish their reprogramming cycle, you don’t actually need to kill all the attackers. Far better event than the damned workshop defense ones.
---
I could totally gey behind this, especially if using revolvers. Couple of things though. 
---
- A  straight % damage reduction would be much more useful than %damage resist increase.
---
- critical hits already ignore armor
---
A serendipity esque perk for complete damage avoidance for handguns would be neat too. Something like 15% chance to avoid damage for 2 seconds after a crit for autos and 30% for semi auto weapons.
---
You get nothing. It’s actually a problem. I’m starting to see more folks complain about it in this subreddit. If you complete the season they should really add some challenges for small atom amounts so that you can keep playing and earning afterward. Right now there’s nothing. Meat week can’t come soon enough for me.
---
better than listening to Julie rambling about her depressing life
---
Ha no! You’ll have to give me atoms for that!
---
Oh 100% - I hope people don't think that I just want things handed out you know. I like the challenge but yes I think there are some things that could be done better to make people enjoy it more. more options and things like that - like for the perk packs someone mentioned to make those an option for caps or scrip or a perk pack - I think giving people the option to choose on those type of rewards would be good.
---
Don't know if you saw below, but, it's alot easier and cheaper to continuously work on a game rather than make a new one.
---
They bought the studio that makes fo76 just for the game.
---
Not even a week, a day before the deadline suddenly they needed 90% less.
---
Damn, any chance you’ll release the hat a month later only in a different color for me to buy?
---
Like, we know the dupers aren't selling these for caps. LOL
---
So here’s my stance on it. Who cares? You wanna know why? Because Bethesda allowed all the duper’s back after they duped all legacy and sought after guns and armor and they didn’t get anything other then a week suspension and got to keep all the weapons they duped. So if Bethesda doesn’t do anything to ppl that are duping stuff then selling it for real money or Bethesda doesn’t deal with ppl that steal from ppl while trading. Then who cares about ppl having ammo machines? I don’t care because I craft all mine with no problem. I use 45. So I use scrapped perk and get a boat load of steel then I use excavator and goto lucky hole line to get so much lead so I don’t need the machines. But everyday someone says about ppl doing this. But really why should we care when Bethesda doesn’t care about the ppl that are actually hurting the game and making money off of scamming ppl? I love this game but they have to go after ppl that actually mess the game up and when they start to do that then I’ll change my stance on this.
---
I mean without deliberately hunting it.
---
You are. Cause even if someone saw you there and reported you, absolutely nothing would have been done. It’s only called an “exploit” on here by the white knights, not in any patch notes or by the community team.
---
Good luck on your novel my friend, would love to read as soon as it’s finished
---
What it looking like
---
No. I’ll just sell the hat for real life money a month later!
---
You need a clipboard and a fancy hat, it's what seals the deal.
---
I want to use this emote but it won't allow me to change/expand any of my emotes (PS4) so I am stucj just throwing up on people as apology
---
I took me a minute but I got the joke!
---
PS, I hate you because I ran to the nearest armor bench
---
Here’s my current Bloodied Heavy PA [build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e144b8e&amp;d=p00eh2ir2l71lt2lu2s01ce0cu2sg2sq2s32sr2ls2a04a72ek0ib4ip2lg2&amp;n=Bloodied%20Heavy%20PA). Enjoy :)
---
Will post when it’s done. It’s going to be a town that was taken over by the blood eagles
---
Yeah I am glad that at least this way free because I wouldn't have paid to do this haha
---
Let's be real; there isn't a damn player in this game who isn't secretly grateful dupers have duped.
---
There is something like that in RDR and OW?
---
Its probably less of a lie and more of a bending of the truth, yes its true, "they" dont have the tools to fix it, they being the customer service team, the devs will have those tools though, they probably just dont want to escalate to the dev team
---
thanks man appreciate it
---
What is cork even used to craft?
---
It’s starting to get to that point for me, I’m level 81 right now. One of my friends has opted for leveling up with his secondary character who is still level 60-something. But yeah it’s tedious.
---
I sort of felt it balanced out.  Cork was more numerous but in lower cork per item.  While concrete since most of the time you grabbed full bags meant you were getting a fair bit at a time whenever you found some.
---
* Blocker 3
---
* Heavy Gunner 3
---
* Expert Heavy Gunner 3
---
* Master Heavy Gunner 3
---
* Stabilised 3
---
* Glowsight/ Exterminator 3
---
That's the basic Heavy Gunner set, Bloodied adds in things, Junkies can add in things.
---
Edit to add, The gun used is important, ballistic ammo doesn't weight all that much unless you are carrying an armouries worth, Gatling Laser however, those FC's can weight you down so Batteries included is a good choice (Along with Power user for double duration) Plasma Gats are a good middle ground, those cores only weight 1lb
---
Id take Rex from fallout 4 too
---
Are you claiming that each level, past 100 requires 15,880 xp? I’m a level 525 and it takes around 80,000 xp for me to level up.
---
&gt;	- First thing that came to mind is "thank god I can finally enjoy the game again". Which is a strange thing to feel I admit, it made me wonder if the LR did more harm than good by taking away fun from the game. I was finally happy to do whatever I wanted to do without having to feel like I was ticking boxs.
---
This is my problem with the season. I think the rewards are fine overall and make up for the decrease in atoms, but it’s just such a distraction from the core game. I know people can say (and I probably have) that you don’t need to do the run. This is true, but it still is a big distraction. The focus of the game should be on the game and having fun, no completing daily challenges.
---
lisa needs braces
---
Oh no you're like my friend Devil.. he has to pick up everything.. always encumbered lol
---
Just to clarify, I always use “damage resist” when I mean “reduction”, so True Grit would function like a situational version of Dodgy. Also, I’m not sure if criticals *do* ignore armour, because the damage boost I see from crits is always a consistent and proportional increase from my “normal” damage (+50% I think). If critical hits ignored armour they’d hit a lot harder than they do now. I might test this later though as I’m a critical hit shotgun build.
---
Ah sorry.  I glanced at "New" before posting this without looking at the times listed.  I didn't realize this subreddit moved so fast that the first page of New was only like an hour ago.
---
The Quack mask also changes your light. Didn't know if you knew.
---
Possum buttplugs.
---
I was doing stuff everyday but im just skipping days now. I just dont see whats the point. Nothings new and there is still nothing fun to do .
---
Not a lot... some armor or armor mods maby?
---
You know, it would be really nice if for once Bethesda just admited they made a mistake and apologized. It seems like every time they make a mistake with something, either a poor excuse or them putting their hands over their eyes and pretending it doesn't exist follows.
---
The perk card packs will become important once the legendary perks are released. Also scrip is vital to building your endgame loadout. You need a lot of modules to get a good set of secret service gear
---
i feel any still live games will be part of it regardless of if it's "top 100". same reason i suspect it will be backwards compatable on ps4, if not day one, than fairly early on.
---
I don’t think that helps if it’s even true. (Yes, corporations will lie to consumers when the consumer can’t prove otherwise, so long as it makes things look better for them. Examples: “The Atom Shop will only ever be cosmetic,” “All content will be free to earn in game” [1st, Scrapbox, any purchase only cosmetic]). 
---
Let’s assume even one dev doesn’t find the game fun. Then it’s just a job. They do x, y, and z because they have to, not because they want to. If they don’t enjoy it to begin with, there isn’t any personal incentive to fix things. Just their work orders
---
We starve this game for cash and all we'll see is sunset.
---
I feel the quest designers and artist/writers seem ripe for Fallout compared to who did 4.
---
I have no idea, just never seen it pop up when I'm crafting anything.
---
They've always done this, its because it doesn't fit the narrative of the time, the current narrative on here is "latest patch bad, Bethesda bad"  
---
so anything that doesn't say basically that is not for posting at this time.  
---
(this isn't unique to this sub obviously its a reddit wide thing)
---
It’s got the jitter bug that’s why
---
When does LR end?  I can't find it in game
---
Who else thinks that making a new toon every couple of days shouldn't be the way to incentive you to play?
---
I got stuck on taggerdys thunder mission for like 2 weeks because of the scorch beasts being 15 levels above me
---
I always do this event. It's good for xp, legendaries, and you have a chance at getting legendaries that only drop from the machine, like the ripper.
---
Lmao I don’t think I’ve seen a single person with the atom shop fasnacht masks on
---
Juicehead seems to think  this is a next year thing, if I heard him right.
---
That number is just whatever someone chooses to enter on their website.  They should go big and claim players have donated eleventy billion cork so far.
---
They could even go abstract and claim we've donated delicious purple out of fantastic dinosaurs corks.
---
it not being here pre-wastelanders but being here after is something i consider to be a retcon. and its a fairly minor one tbh. there were already billboards for it, so who's to say it wasnt canonically already available?
---
besides, we already have a new cola flavor for 2103. and we made it ourselves.
---
Imho it's like "i always fast travel to location XY to find those two stimpaks". It's just as "hard" as getting those \~80 caps. Aka close to useless
---
You'd be surprised, some high level friends or even some vendors still have the plans or can craft you one. Just ask around!
---
It ends in september. I don't know if you'll be able to grind it that far but you can try. There is supposed to be another double score weekend I believe so that could help you get far enough that you could buy a few levels
---
I honestly was expecting the donations of cork to be around double that of concrete received, just from people that relentlessly go after screws and plastics. I'm a hoarder myself.. cough.. and even my surplus of cork to concrete was like 2:1.
---
But this much in two days is a *bit* nuts.
---
and then becomes the main antagonist of the fractured steel storyline
---
Nice 
---
Yea i ran it solo yesterday 
---
Had like 2 three star weapons which was nice
---
Off the top of my head? Light/Ultra-Light armor mods and baseball grenades. Can't think of anything else.
---
and thus, by helping the settlers even a little, you got a free suit instead of being charged up the ass for it. it really does make sense in-lore.
---
"oh you think 4k gold is too high a price? well i agree, but considering you didnt help us, like, at all, we dont feel the need to help you either. pay up."
---
I'm going to finish it today as well. I didn't grind it out or anything, didn't spend any atoms either, just did the dailies and weeklies like I would usually do anyways. Played the game as I normally do, no grinding it out or anything like that. 
---
I will continue to play but probably not nearly as much since there is zero incentives to do them after it's finished. I don't think they thought that part thru very well.
---
You assume I have friends to play with. A big part of this is made for team play when a big part of the community is solo players who want a dungeon crawl or lone wolf survival or wandering trader experience. I have several friends that play FO76 that never play with each other because they only play solo.
---
&gt; I'm like level 380 on one character with like 150+ perk packs
---
You get perk packs every 5 levels so you don't have 150.  Probably closer to 70
---
Most likely September 8th.
---
Prob look best with the vampire outfit from a while back.
---
They seem to find the worst "solution" even when a better one is right in front of them.  Why not just adjust the remaining totals at the same time they adjusted concrete?  Why adjust one and fake another?  Their decision making is baffling.
---
Yea they are enough to complete 100%.. 
---
I don’t go out of my way (other then playing every day ) to get score and I’m rank81 
---
I’m not knocking you for you grinding out and burning yourself I’m an mmorpg player myself and god know I been in your shoes before In multi games 
---
But let not blame Bethesda and demand changes to the system because a small and vocal few are burned for not doing the content as intendant
---
Thank you.
---
I am on 94.  I have used atoms 1 time. I did it to compensate for all the NW daily's I didn't do because I can't stand that mode.  So I compensated myself.  The other 93 levels are pure grind.
---
I mean level ups sorry! Like points to move around but I see what you are getting at!
---
Me personally I haven't used any atoms and will finish it with todays dailies. Never did any XP grinding or anything either just played normally.
---
Throw in ivory grip and mr handy buzzsaw plans and you got a deal
---
I feel like it's a decent distraction while waiting for new content, but I'd rather completion be somewhat easily obtainable by the halfway point in the season's length. Enough that you CAN ignore it, or stop playing a few days, etc. and still reach the finish.
---
People can always cash in Atoms to move forward even quicker, go ahead and leave that, but that should really be for impatience or people really struggling to finish because they don't play that often.
---
I feel for you because I’m the same way. Before I would do challenges for the atoms. But after completing it I have no incentive to do any of them. But oh well, I can just do what I always did and just play the game how I want to and don’t have to worry about getting everything done so I can finish it. It’s definitely less stressful and maybe next season It won’t be such a long grind and maybe we won’t get so many stupid skins like how many ghilles we got and how many power armor paints we got.
---
Yeah I was pleasantly surprised with that one
---
I'm going to not donate anything. But thanks for the hat anyway!
---
take care
---
Usually people just it to soak it. They like-a to soak-a the cork.
---
With that and selling supermutant weapons, you dont need selling serums to vendors yet. After a bit of endgame playing, you will realize that getting 30k caps it's not difficult. Then you can start buying serum recipes
---
They reduced the concrete event by a factor of 10? Probably just multiplied actual cork donations by 10 or more. I only donated 250 cork.
---
Then be clear on what you mean the first damn time. We arent in your head seeing what youre thinking or know or dont know. Learn to be specific. A paragraph wasnt even needed. One simple sentence would suffice.
---
Of course I do.   Sad thing to admit, but I bought nine levels with my atoms from Fallout First. And I think that's the whole point of the legendary run/ daily challenge.   I'm pretty close to the finish line. But the weird thing about grinds like this is that the closer I get to the end, the less I care about it and the less I feel like doing it.  Maybe that's the point. You get tired of grinding so you just spend atoms.
---
Sorry I can’t do that. What about a silt bean stew recipe
---
Please close the door on your way out.  Thanks.
---
Thank you a bunch
---
in the prefs file change ipresetinterval=1 to 0
---
Then use the nvidia controls to set frame rate limit etc
---
Yes. There should be a countdown for the enemies to reach the buildable area in order for killing them to be a requirement. How can we be expected to kill them if they don't show up?
---
They'll all miraculously complete, the events that "will unlock if we complete certain events" are already on the calendar to happened before those resource events have even started

Just scrap her chair. Build once a day for her quest, and then scrap it when you're done.
---
And if you play it near the Mr. Gutsy robots, they get more aggro/increase in difficulty.
---
The number of points to earn in level “n” in order to progress to the next are:
---
XP = 160n + 40 
---
So for me (at level 525) it works out to:
---
XP = 160(525)+ 40
---
XP = 84,040
---

Would be nice if you could launch an op with modifiers, and, depending on the amount of modifiers, get up to 5 star drops.
---
"Really?!"
---
No, probably not.
---
I'm not trying to blame anyone or DEMAND anything. I simply think that there are things that could be improved upon to make it more fun for everyone. I'm not gonna throw down my controller if things don't change and boycott Bethesda like some little piss baby lol I'm just not gonna grind it out as hard and that's ok with me xD I don't see why you're acting like I'm so pressed about this just because I think that it could use some polishing. I think it's a neat system that they're trying things out with and are probably going to make changes anyway. There's no harm in providing feedback.
---
Smart
---
What mission do u get them from?
---
I honestly can’t remember where I got it
---
I look forward to you, I’m back post.
---
Or any strikebreaker robot. That's an awesome idea.
---
Cancelling subscriptions is always an option
---
Ofcourse man lol are you guys new to online gaming?!? 
---
If a public event like this fail it show how small the playerbase base is. for PR and marketing purposes it won’t ever fail
---
In the history of gaming event like this , there never been a “failed” in any online game lol
---
Oh yay! Yet another post about an event you don’t have to do!
---
Build chair, wait for her to move away from it, block it with stuff.
---
Oh no I’m actually building a town. Just wanted to make a joke
---
Maybe Im just optimistic but I really think they will. This is the first attempt and with most things like this the first attempt is typically the least impressive
---
same reason people post questions or updates without just looking for existing posts to contribute to. that's why we have an endless stream of cork-related posts today.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAA1xgTTw9w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAA1xgTTw9w)
---
Oh! I thought Elder Scrolls and Fallout shared the same engine. Well, this is an entire different beast then.
---
Neither of those points are true.
---
That’s why I said it tells me they just don’t care if they really have to log hours and see how frustrating it is to die because your hot wheel quit working and have to get you your gun out of your pip boy. I shouldn’t have to “play around the bugs” that will literally cost matches which is the entire point of NW. I shouldn’t have to try 6 times to fast travel in adventure when the game has been out for two years. That’s like core gameplay functionality. I didn’t even bring up all the other bugs with events like not even being able to start some of them. It’s just mind boggling.

Maybe give it 1.5-2x the damage of a .45 lever action rifle, but also +30% recoil or something?
---
They mentioned the ones in the brotherhood update would be light in the quake con QandA. They didn’t say anything past that.
---
I literally just finished 5 minutes ago myself. Like you I set up the level 100 rewards, looked at them a moment and logged out. Completely left feeling very underwhelmed. Im sure this is the best the devs can do though as ive heard from a few sources this team that made FO76 usually only makes mobile games. So they arent used to creating anything generally regarded as fun.   
---
In typing this I think I finally decided to just uninstall and admit I enjoyed it for a year but what they are adding to the game now just isnt in any way fun. I think its off to the next game now whatever that may be.
---
First one is true. I’ll post it on the subreddit when it’s done and the second point is true because I’ve already built the town exterior just need to decorate
---
I’m sorry I apologize I didn’t intent to make it seem like you blaming or demanding , I’m speaking in general term of the vibe of the community. 
---
I also learn my lesson and next season I’ll just focus on weekly only and have dailies complete as they come. But admittedly I won’t hesitate to buy rank up in the end if rewards seem worth it
---
I made a alt and found it to be a lot easier leveling up the alt than my main. Makes it easier and keeps me still engaged in the game.
---
Idiots.
---
To be clear, the main TES games, and Fallout 3 through 76, share the same engine. ESO does not.

Heavy explosive gun
---
This works for me.
---
Might be because you are cheesing it.  I dont find leveling tedious at all.  And I haven't bought even one level with atoms, what ever you are talking about.  You should save your atoms for purchases until the end, but I think I'm wasting my breath here.
---
Explain the ballistic fiber for home decor?

thanks man

&gt; I know the devs are required to play so that tells me that they just don’t give a crap, and aren’t actually listening, especially when I know other game designers that have found out where the actual major game breaking bugs are, how to fix them, and sent the fix to Bethesda only to have it go ignored. 
---
**Bullshit**. Apparently the lack resource (allocated from people above their paygrade) to both fix the game completely and deliver new content. Either someone outright told them to work on new content with some percentage of the resources or they calculated that it's the content that keeps the people playing.
---
Simply accusing developers of not giving a crap is an asshole statement. It totally ignores how people who create stuff take pride in their work. Especially in gaming, where basically every developer loves to work on games and therefore they DO give a crap. If they didn't, they'dve already jumped the ship to generalist software industry that pays much better.
---
Finally, they are the people who know the game and see the code that we cannot. Therefore they don't accept "fixes" from random armchair "game designers". Like, these folks cannot even verify that the fix works, so how can they be sure that it works? It's just as bad as people who think they are more clever than doctors, just because they read something on the internet.
---
Dude... I already have finished my build since long time, i just need to have my perfect SS armor set and xp set.
---
I solo SBQ without any problems and doing much more dmg then 50 to her, and i don't really care about dmg, if you are good enough you can solo/kill everything event without any legendary stuffs.
---
Actually, i have 38 AGI without raider underarmor and all my armors pieces are UNY/AP i just need to change two pieces for UNY/1AGI, i just have a casual underarmor for extra xp, i'm lvl 420 on this character and I don't play that much during vacation so, for the legendary run and legendary perk that an good extra + xp buff !
---
My perk loadout is based on having the best of both worlds in and out of PA.
---
This happens quite often with my gatling plasma. The gun will just stop firing randomly even though I didn't let off the trigger and nothing it attacking me. I think it's just a bug with heavy weapons that have to spin up. I've had the issue off and on since at least patch 20.
---
If everyone has 1,000 cork like you, it would take 65,000 players to reach this goal. On average, only about 9k people play on steam per day..
---
We should all remember that behind a DEV there's usually a Tech Leader and behind that one there's a boss.. Usually when stuff starts to go really bad it's because some boss is focusing what he thinks is best for Bethesda on top of everything else.. So yeah, devs might not be the issue, I'd say there's a guy in a suit just pissing out devs as much as we are right now.
---
I’d like to see 2 handed gunslinging as a legendary perk. Imagine rolling in with double legendaries.
---
Defending the town uses up armour durability so the guards need supplies to make repairs! This is just a joke/rp post don’t take it too seriously
---
They won't because Bethesda wouldn't let them.
---
Yep I think so too. I know a lot of people think they don't ever take input but I really just hold onto the hope that they're at least reading some of our threads and taking the feedback. I think my feelings on this season are over all positive but there's always room for improvement in everything and nothing is ever perfect first try and I don't expect it to be!
---
I just finished with no atoms spent as well, feel like I have zero reason to sign in now. Daily atom challenges had me playing daily, now when you complete the run you get nothing... daily.
---
Yep, just noticing that. RDR2's reddit is similar now that i think about it...
---
I refer you to my post a few up.
---
This is the only comment with a tiny bit of understanding for game development. 
---
1. Only fixing bugs will not really help. There will always be new ones with additional content. This is time consuming and unproductive.
---
2. There are many people in the company who do not have anything to do with bugfixing. They mostly have also no experience in this. Game development is multi faceted with many specialized tasks. What are they doing when no content will be developed?
---
3. Even just 1 badly tested update can break a sufficiently running game (look at RDO) into a barely recognizable mess. Also, many workarounds are put into the game because many sources of bugs cannot be found it fixed without redoing the engine from the ground. Removing "well-know tolerated" bugs may also have an impact on the workflow of the development and might even break it more, as strange that might sound.
---
Congrats on completing it at least!
---
I've only done this event once and I was the only one there. Wasn't even sure if I was doing it right and it took forever. I was much lower level then, maybe it would be worth giving another shot. I don't remember if there were any legendaries for me. I do remember being bummed I didn't get to keep the mask though 😅
---
Concrete is complete and Cork is about 1/3 of the way done.  Gotta keep up...   Despite everyone's fears, it will be completed on time. [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events?sf126355571=1&amp;fbclid=IwAR0PL7EU70XUikKPYfp1duo5aMS7FJOTEH-mC8oMnISnqzTWbUCc0U0W-eU](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events?sf126355571=1&amp;fbclid=IwAR0PL7EU70XUikKPYfp1duo5aMS7FJOTEH-mC8oMnISnqzTWbUCc0U0W-eU)
---
We had six months of zero content, from last September to April this year before Wastelanders. How an always-online multiplayer game can expect to go that long without any new content is beyond me.
---
We're at the point where a battle pass is seen as new content, when all it did was reskin previously existing challenges.
---
The main problem with the content that's been created is that none of it has been focused towards high-level endgame players. It's great that Wastelanders had a few nice questlines and stories, but that content was maybe 10-15 hours of gameplay - once you've done it, there's stll nothing to do.
---
In the 21 months of this game's existence, the only repeatable endgame content we have received is:
---
* Encryptid. This has a cooldown of three hours, so whilst it's technically repeatable it's nothing something you can do all the time.
---
* Vault 94 raids. Poorly received, no longer in the game.
---
* Project Paradise. Until the introduction of public teams, completely dead. No way of triggering manually.
---
* Radiation Rumble. Same as Project Paradise, though at least it was only dead for about two months rather than a year.
---
Everything else that endgame players can do is grinding. Grinding reputation, grinding caps, grinding treasury notes, grinding scrip, grinding xp - it's basically just doing the same quests and events you did all game with a little extra reward maybe to get you to keep doing it.
---
This game is in dire need of good endgame content. People can say they'll stick around for the bugs, but most of them won't and Bethesda probably won't either. Wastelanders had a well-received launch which made people forget about the issues with the game for a while. If there was content that people enjoyed doing and doing all the time, it will serve as a distraction to everything else and Bethesda can buy themselves time to patch up the most egregious problems and make the game properly playable.
---
Yeah I am looking forward to see what the next theme is going to be.I am just hoping not BOS because if that's the case I just won't have to worry about it at all haha
---
Did you load into the test server in between? The test server will deselect all the atom shop stuff. 
---
Other than that, did you make those selections from the main menu?
---
That's what I was thinking. I feel like if we complete the board, we should have our dailies and weeklies revert back to atoms. Or do what Warframe has actually done with their Nightwave series, if you're familiar with it. They have their own currency after you finish all of the series that you can collect to get cosmetics and modifications. Bethesda should take note.
---
Whats weirdos that i still had the mask on over the gas mask my character wears. Was weird lol
---
Monster mash is what ive been using to boost xp. Literally noone ever does it and its choc full of ghouls. Not to mention most mm events have multiple 3star legendaries. Easy xp and easy legendaries.
---
im gonna give that a shot, tryed 7 different times and even played 3 other games to test it and it seems its only with 76
---
Not a normal interaction this guy was looking for a higher level to farm kills off of
---
That explains my confusion then, thank you. 
---
Well, if Fallout 76 is stuck with an engine barely stable for offline play, the kind of situations we see since a few months are meant to happen. Which is sad of course. 
---
Fortunately, I play on PS4 and it seems to have less hackers and bugs than on PC.
---
NW is its own little treasure trove of bullshit on PC. With the endless hackers and then dumb dailies like pick 2 locks (specifically because it’s random if you can land with no one around, or if you’ll load in before they do, and then people will camp those spots so others can’t get the daily), or whenever someone gets in PA and the game makes them invisible to some players because why not? NW on PC is shit for the hackers alone. Then Bethesda steps up to the plate to make that single run a double, and if they’re really up to it, they’ll hit a home run and knock you back to the desktop
---
E: I typed all of this out while waiting to load into a lobby. It still hasn’t loaded in yet
---
They do ignore armor. Very apparent on the sbq. Normal shot with my AA50fr western hit for 36 damage, the crits are 350.
---
When you test couple things to keep in mind dont use bloodied setup since the damge is so high it over runs DR easily. IIRC There was a bug where sneak attacks ignored armor aswell. Not sure if thats still a thing.  The best way to test would to be find the behemoth near twin likes. Shoot it jn the torso with a non legendary weapon while NOT sneaking, than torso shot it with a crit and see the damage difference.
---
There used to be a problem with people building their CAMPs in such a way where they kill the ghouls, but I”m pretty sure they pushed out the building zone so that’s not an issue anymore.  
---
People do still from time to time nuke Whitesprings, it’s still a decent place to farm flux and the ghouls are worth some decent XP still, so I wouldn’t take it personally if people nuked the area from time to time, but its a lot rarer now than it was a year ago.  
---
Overall sounds like the one off troll, you should be fine at that location. Worst case he had his camp in a similar location and was just mad you were there.
---
That's good to know but I think you can see how bad that can be with a melee weapon, especially as that bug is so consistent that anytime I do in fact get staggered it takes ages to rev up again even if I am not hit anymore
---
I keep a extra gun on me chambered in 38 that will 1 shot the normals and doesn't kill the legendary
---
Sounds cool, requires money for licenses and all that jazz (And rock, and soul, and...).
---
Might be neat to make a spotify or Apple Music channel to share with people though
---
Dude you’re taking this too seriously. Sorry if I offended you by making fun of the atlas event
---
I can craft you some for free but I won't be on for about 4 hours. Ign is newt341.
---
I've had my camp on the golf course there for a couple of weeks and have yet to encounter anything like this
---
Went on a legendary hunt last night at Whitespring, which is just down the hill from my CAMP, and watched ghoul after ghoul turn into frozen Heisman trophies after just a few points of damage. While I enjoyed hacking their helpless forms with my electrified Assaultron blade without retribution, I did NOT enjoy watching their drops disappear before my very eyes, and those legendaries would have gone a long way towards my SCORE.
---
So yeah, I agree. These things shouldn't still be happening.
---
Likely he tagged the enemies and was using you to finish them, since you were in a predictable place.
---
I lived at the whitespring for a long time and never had anything like that happen. I was really close to enemy's as well. My camp was on the little creek right by the club house
---
True. I was never turned off playing by bugs, but by core design decisions. Manage inventory on character, manage stash. Sell legendaries each day until you got all the scripts. Craft SS gear, stop crating until I turned unwanted SS legendaries in scripts. Can't loot anything because my inventory is full. Lots of items are hard to farm...
---
I did the last quest with foundation but told them they had to split it with crater. Foundation most I’ve heard them say was you got the gold they knew I could do it from a guard. At crater they say they wish they could see foundations faces when I told them to share it with crater.
---
I hate this bitch..
---
You read that wrong, im not saying youn only do 50 to her, i was saying that the 30% damage youd loose would do about 50 less to her. You probably hit her for what 350+ per sneaky headhsot if i had to guess.
---
Mythic dungeons from WoW and Nightfall Ordeals from D2 have absolutely spoiled dungeon modifier for me. I gush over stuff like that
---
Ever since the dawn of Everquest I’ve seen the “I’m quitting” posts in one form Or another.  I never understood if it’s because they want people to talk them out of it or something, like they are hesitating (or the opposite, they want people to validate their decisions in some way).  Others still think that the game devs are more likely to read their post on a random forum than just emailing support and saying why you quit.
---
Lol. Seriously if I wanted to argue this out I wouldn’t have used a common comedy aspect of referring to a previous comment.
---
Cool add me when your on
---
Basic psychology. Everything in atomshop is designed and carefully planned to make you want to buy stuff.
---
burrowers will chew on anything you build. I found two eating at the wall of my camp yesterday.
---
I only have one character I actually play so I just make a new one every couple of days when I don't feel like leveling my main. Getting the first 2-3 levels are really easily with the Wayward and flatwoods quests. Sadly the free level up you get for leaving the vault doesn't count tho.
---
Represent!
---
There's a few respawn bugs.
---
Can't respawn anywhere.
---
Can only respawn at 76
---
Respawn and you're alive, but still shows the death cam and respawn prompt. You have to respawn somewhere else.
---
Can't press the button at all to respawn and have to quit the game.
---
Being a challenge I'd think more players would have them in thier vendors.  I'd think they would sell fast
---
Yeah.  2-3 shot her
---
Team only prevent others from joining your world.
---
The text next to the button says which type is currently enabled. Make sure it says team only
---
Idk I felt like the shrug was just like "It's only game, why you have to be mad" because honestly sometimes people just need to chill the fuck out and remember none of it actually matters in any other context. I've been known to give too much credit to things in the past though
---
I understand where you are coming from but to their credit, the dev Valseek responded to one of my comments and said the building restriction was a mistake and they will soon figure out a way to change it back. Also on a recent podcast with the devs, they claimed they have a team specifically working on fixing camp building to implement more freedom and functionality to building.
---
I actually think builders are a lucrative customer for them since they are more likely to buy all the camp atom shop goodies.
---
Yeah I agree
---
And didnt mean to come across as saying yoj need to change your build, was just rrying to say even if they did move pistol perks to perception,  you could still kick ass and take names with the pipe weapons.
---
I'm following one now actually. It's not blacklist radio, it's just, like, 400 songs that come from the era lol.
---
I mean they formed a brand new AAA studio with industry veterans for ESO, for 76, they just bought a failed studio to make a game with one of the most popular IPs.
---
Sounds like he just wanted someone else to do the heavy lifting so he could just get the tags and easy xp. The only other reason people do it is either your base is in their spot or they want to be a dick. As long as your turrets aren't aggroing and killing the spawns there isn't anything to worry about. The build zones were pushed further out so that usually isn't an issue.
---
Yeah exactly, why would i spend another 6 months grinding away the same stuff just so bugs can get fixed, i would just go and play something else, i already did that twice in the last 6 months, only for a few weeks to a month a peice though, a 6 month break would probably make me not come back, and i certainly wouldnt be paying for 1st if i do that
---
I'm selling mine for 1200 Xbox lol
---
100% fake numbers. I played yesterday for 8 hours SPECIFICALLY grinding for cork.
---
I have 200
---
Yeah i havent seen it personally but ive seen people on this sub mentioning it a few times recently
---
Extended backpack works with stealth suit hiker perk and med perk 4weapons two rifles a mini gun  have 215 weight can go to 330 in loot

enclave gang feels your pain
---
That would take some effort and thought, something the dev team isnt capable of.

That's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights. I run ffr instead of explosive. Been using this build for a solid 200 levels now
---
Worst trading system I’ve encountered in a game yet.
---
"Pro Tip" place down a scarecrow somewhere out in the open.  Enemies are drawn to them and will attack them if you stand on something they can't path to.  I just abandon the events though, because the only time I keep and recapture workshops are for cores.

She is rarely playing at my camp instead she runs around it in full circles, sometimes she stops and tinkers with something then back to running laps.
---
You sell the plan for 3k! ?
---
I made alts to combat it and it's getting long for them too now.
---
They never gonna move this because light/small weapons was always related to agility special category like i already said.
---
"I'm so-blurrrgrgrhhh" gave me a Chuckle
---
I mean, in a sense I can see that scrapping cards can be helpful. Right now I have a number of perk cards that are copies of perks I have already maxed out (i.e heavy gunner, gunsmith, picklock, science, etc) so this is a way to clean up that type of clutter
---
The duper’s have finally found a way to support the rest of the community
---
Saying you have 8gbs of vram doesn't mean anything. You could have anything from a shitty gpu from 6 years ago to a 2080
---
Damn I’ve been de-corking all this “hick” wine but I’ve onlly ben abled to’ geet ti ellevn 🍾😪
---
I’m so much happier now that I’m not playing this game anymore. Replaying fallout 4 with a few mods is way better than this mess
---
I’m not mad, I’m just not terribly motivated. I actually like the idea of objective of turning in excess scrap for rewards.  
---
There are some plans I don’t have that I can get, but it’s not anything super special.  Sure it would be nice to have the sturdy raider armor plans since you can’t get them from vendors, but since it just crafts non-legendary items, it’s not really that high of a priority.
---
That’s nice of you.
---
If they didn’t want you to take their water, etc. they would lock it. Assume that if it is unlocked it is meant for everybody.
---
In my camp, the only thing I lock is my lead extractor. I put my camp there for that purpose and I want to make sure I get as much lead as possible out of it. Everything else - water purifier, collection station, etc. - is for the community.
---
They start to glow green and become legendary
---
I've had my camp there for about a month now and got nuked 2 or 3 times. I thought people were doing it to mess with me at first. Like the person above me said, it's not a terribly uncommon place to nuke for farming. Most nukes get dropped at fissure site prime, but I'd still check your map during countdowns. 
---
I've found if you're playing with friends and don't want to hop servers; you can leave and rejoin after the nuke hits (though you'll need a hazmat suit or PA to reduce the rads you'll be getting once you rejoin).
---
I'm not sure I understand.  People price their vendor items as they see fit.  If they're too expensive, they won't sell.  That player will either relist the items, or they don't really care about vending.
---
It's also possible that the player doesn't know what a good market price for an item is, so they list it at an inflated price initially.  
---
Or it could be a savvy way to sell other products available at that vendor.  If someone is really into gaming the vending system, greatly inflating the price of some items will make other (still inflated) prices seem more reasonable.  
---
Most camps are left open as a service to all players - offering crafting, vending, and even in many cases food and water for free.  Imagine a store offering you food and water when you walked in, and let you use their phone and/or bathroom all for free.  Would you then bitch to them if they didn't price their stock in a way that aligns with your expectations?
---
In any case, it's not the vendor's responsibility to offer products at prices YOU find reasonable.
---
Especially when the game dies eventually.  With how it's going that's going to be soon
---
Unless someone gives em a right good fucking kicking.
---
Some players have access to whatever walls are on the atomic shop. This has been a bug for a long time and even effects myself. Anytime they swap walls out of the atomic shop, I lose access but every new one they add, I immediately have without needing to buy.
---
Rise up my fellow corn soup gang
---
Thank you! This is honestly much better than silence or “We are passing this to the team”
---
I just have to take my weight reduction perks off and I would be at capacity
---
This a feature not a bug, just like the trial fireworks ;)
---
This happened to me as well. Waiting to see if I get Frankie as a merchant
---
This isn’t a bad idea, it also wouldn’t even be a bad idea to make it permanent. Just keep handing things in - similar to how in Fallout 3 we could hand in the scrap at any time for XP and caps.  
---
I would also like better rewards, if the event was permanent, and the reward was better (and not something that can be duped), I’d be far more motivated to keep playing every day.  
---
Shoot, let me turn in a bunch of unwanted legendary weapons and armor for a lunch box and I’d be super happy.
---
And I assure you they will. I had every serum for 200 caps each. Sometimes a lower level would buy one or two which made me happy. I even got messages from lower levels thanking me for having a certain serum and pricing it so they could afford it. Most of the time it was a guy in the 250+ level range buying all of them. Now I have them at 330 and that seems to be the sweet spot.
---
You found Paige's secret washroom where he actually gets work done.
---
Also, the mine might be for the Colossus Event. They did say it was down a mine, and an NPC at Foundation triggers the quest.
---
Have a good time trying because Shady Sands didn't become the NCR until 2186
---
Your perspective is sound. Using 1st members as a baseline no freaking possibility for that much cork. Noone even has it tagged for search. Bullocks
---
I don't use the buzzblade for that reason.
---
Money.
---
Stuff like this is whats wrong with this game. Its been broken since launch and never fixed. The guy who sells gold was selling unlimited gold earlier this week and was patched in 12 hours. Bethesda simply dont care if it doesnt affect possible FO1 memberships.
---
he probably had his camp there and wanted you to leave the world so he could place there
---
Any luck? Trying to do the same thing with the blood eagle nest. No luck on mat for me, tried the campfire, no go, also tried blueprinting, nope. I'm curious about the dirt tiles, but others have commented saying that water purifiers don't work so I'm doubtful. I did find a video of a guy placing the greenhouse on top of a resource gatherer, so maybe using the munitions factory blueprint glitch you could do this...but that's a risk of being banned and permanent camp item, tough pill to swallow. I might test this at a workshop sometime.
---
Anyone who finished early did this. I'm not sure what level I was when I started on my main but I've gone up ... quite a few levels (and finished a few weeks back).
---
I do find the more seating and workbenches available, the more the allies move around.
---
I most definitely get the  sentiment when people think games companies aren't listening but I feel like that at least partially comes down to there being more differing feedback and less manpower to get the work done than the player bases think. Overall I think they've been doing a pretty alright job updating the game so far, maybe a little slower and more missteps than would be ideal but honestly I think it could all be going a lot worse. To me it seems like the seasons are gonna be relatively easy to improve on too it seems like even just improving the rewards would make a lot of people at least semi satisfied
---
Boooooo!!!!!!  God no!  People would get so bored, drop the game, and it would be retired.
---
I hope they fix it some day, the chainsaw feels nice if it doesn't happen
---
Yeah you misunderstood. It's not debate I'm not interested in. I have no interest in debating you. 
---
If in the future you are looking to debate with people then don't start out being condescending.
---
They will charge whatever people are prepared to pay. It literally is a case of don't like it don't pay it.
---
Yeah, iirc Phil spencer recently said something along the lines of him disliking platform exclusive games because the players deserve to choose which platform to play the game on, which is a great way to think.
---
The same case goes for PlayStation, while Sony is more hard-headed in terms of their platform they are slowly letting PS4 exclusives on pc (horizon zero dawn and death stranding recently released on pc!) which is great, PS4 have a lot of great exclusive games that every gamer should get the chance to play regardless of their platform 
---
I hope with next gen consoles both Microsoft and Sony get rid of that exclusive bullshit and unite for a better gaming experience for everybody. I wouldn’t mind if they take it as far as including platform crossplay too so game developers don’t have to do it themselves
---
Okay, thanks!
---
Then it’s on bethesda to fix it, not our job to police ourselves without knowing if it’s even on Bethesda’s radar.
---
Yeah. I made a new character, and I try to use the closest to levelling for that challenge.
---
&gt;  You should save your atoms for purchases until the end, 
---
I'll spend my atoms however I want.
---
Oh no... You just invented toilet trap camps... Pick the lock and get rads from water splashing!
---
The first ever explosive weapon I ever had drop from an enemy was a level 35 explosive laser pistol. It sits proudly in my stash. Why should one of my only trophies from the early days be deleted?
---
Still not as bad as “how NOW brown cow”
---
Thank you /u/Ladydevann  
---
If there's any specific information that would be useful I'm sure we'd be able to try and answer, to narrow it down. Like reaching out for major bugs, not everyone will proactively report, but people will respond to closed question questionnaires. Could do it via a email to subscribers, or series of emails.  
---
If you're concerned about PR by overadvertising  bugs then have it so that users have to answer a series of questions to describe the bug, rather than presenting the bug by name.  
---
Just want this stuff to get better.
---
Hey, dont downvote, I'm on your side lmao
---
I’ve found a useful bug recently.  Everytime I return to Ward and he gives me a new find.  I then go down to Paige’s area, come back talk to Ward again and the quest completes with all the rewards.  I thought it was a mistake first time but it’s happened everytime since
---
Not going to lie.i would probably pay to get that black knight gun...but  all these pics are ripped from the internet or a seller site not in someone's vendor. Not that it makes it any better I guess
---
It's not the goals that annoyed me.
---
Its the (unpublicized) minimum donation.
---
I wasted my time to hike there only to discover they didn't want the 100 mats I had.
---
And I'm sure others wasted their caps to FT there to discover the same thing.  Then had to spend more caps to go (wherever)
---
Beggars cant be choosers - should have accepted any donation, however large or small.
---
It just don’t have a community donation event. Do something else.
---
Nah, hate mail.
---
LoL, I meam sure, if they fixed it
---
FYI: Dropping in on an Encryptid event is always a good way to get this achieved.
---
Was just about to post this! Wanna help eachother??
---
That wasn’t me, i upvoted your comment
---
Man if we could just kick them into fixing things. We'd probably all have strong legs and the devs would all have horribly bruised shins
---
Yeah what im doing i only give 250 in case theres some you didn't contribute thing lol.
---
Melee can kill the sbq in a few hits with the right build and alchohol/drugs like nukashine
---
It's super annoying. Especially when it's 3 waves
---
It's not even just legacy weapons sadly. There are plenty of ways to one-shot everything without using a hacked, magic, or legacy weapon.   
---
I've been playing for a long time and never has it been as bad as it is right now. You have so many selfish people just killing everything, everywhere now.
---
Sorry dude, you're a bit too late to farm karma and rewards off of an 'I'm leaving!' post. :(
---
Exactly. They aren't trying to sell this to a level 5 character: they are trying to sell it to someone on a level 100+ character who is planning on leveling up an alt sometime in the future.
---
I have never been into a test server as ive never seen it on Steam, i knew they had it on the B launcher but i never bothered with it. And yes ive made all of those selections in the main menu. The loot bag will show up once i select it and go into a game but the emotes wont. All CAMP items stay even after exit. Its only items i have to manually select to equip in the atomic shop.
---
I mean... you did finish two weeks early. That may not have helped. Not in any way saying you're wrong, but it probably didn't help.
---
It's probably not legacy weapons on their own. Will be a mixture of legacy/magic weapons and shit loads of buffs.
---
Also, glitched weapons are not legacy weapons.
---
Nobody duped cork 😂😂😂
---
That's pretty much it yes.
---
The thing is explosive weapons were all nerfed a while back as they were too powerful, but for some reason  they didn't reduce the explosive damage on energy weapons, which is now a legacy effect.
---
All they need to do is nerf the explosive damage dealt by legacys and they will be worse than the ballistic equivalent. Then people will naturally stop using them.
---
Two days?  Cork started yesterday didn’t it?
---
The black prospector hat would go perfect
---
It's not outdated. Both sexes especially women haven't suddenly stopped cheating.  
---
Women tend to go for men for their: Status, money, how big their home is, net worth, and what benefits they can bring her.  
---
Men overall tend to look for a woman they find attractive, who has a sense of humor, can both work and take care of the home and physical attributes that help create healthy children and are good carers.
---
Probably discussing how much they can charge for 1 wall in terms of Atoms.
---
Concrete is easy in regard of cork, you can build workshop with extractor, some workshop have 3 concrete extractors... it's 100 every 20 minute or so, and you just have to go and defend sometimes (this will proc the event SCORE if you need some...)
---
Cork is boresome at a terrible level...
---
sure you can get pipe weapon but it's 1 cork per weapon (where you can get 20 steel per weapon)  
---
also 1 cork per golf ball... 
---
It's a joke.
---
Yeah I think they've set a lot of good groundwork with wastelanders itself and the season system. I think they gave themselves a good base to work with and I think they can do a lot with it.
---
And ultracite armor.
---
Not an ammo trader, but I put popular ammo in my shop for 2 caps each because :
---
A) it lights up more options on my world map icon
---
B) I don't want to fill my machine all the time
---
I know this may tick some people off but this is how I want to play and it does work to attract customers and still get the daily challenge when people buy 1,1,1 bullet for a petty 6 caps. I can dig it.
---
I think 6.5 million cork is unbelievable tbh. 65 million is ridiculous
---
Yeah I would appreciate the daily atoms returning so we still have some things to work on daily but I mainly log on to hang out with my friends :P
---
Don't forget that teammates can't build in your camps after wastelanders either
---
Been saying this since launch when they made no improvements whatsoever after all the input they got on beta.
---
It started tuesday at 9AM PT.
---
\[Edit\] Holy crap, my sense of time is way off. I thought it was thursday today. Thank you for catching that.
---
So bad, don't even try much anymore. Not sure what is harder: getting a good role or selling the junk the purveyor gives.
---
You would run into the same issue that happens already, multiple people or groups running around as one big team regardless of what was intended. The first time it was kind of amusing because I had about 10 people in marine armor all chasing me with melee weapons. The more recent encounters have been more irritating.
---
On the flip side, because concrete is more useful people were less willing to donate that. Not everything in life is a conspiracy.
---
Is it 10-31 pt now?
---
Iv had it happen twice this week. Someone just shows up and melts the queen. Especially if it was on pc it was possibly a hacked weapon. Otherwise probably one of those “magic weapons” iv heard about. Something to do with bashing damage and certain legendary effects will allow guns to do insane damage.
---
I think you have three parties of thinking on this one:
---
First you have the veterans, those who have been here since day one or shortly thereafter and who arguably most likely have the most materials to lend to this project (aside from duping), however, the rewards offer zero to no incentive for the time and materials required. At this point most of the veterans have most if not all of the plans available in the loot pool and it is viewed as not being worth it because other than the community reward itself, the materials may be more valuable at this point to them, than the rewards. With Bethesda’s lack of communication on many things, coupled with Bethesda’s seeming desire for the player to grind to the bone, whose to say we won’t need those materials ourselves? I’ve seen that before in another game. 
---
Second you have the Ignored. A lot of the vets fall into this category as well but you can easily lump some late comers to the game, possibly even high level new players as well. The problem here is that this challenge comes on the tail of a very unpopular Mole Miner Treasure Hunting event. The plans and items were exactly the same as the previous Christmas event, they were attached to low level Legendaries which did drop legendary weapons, but which anyone level 30+ wouldn’t use, and the community at large voiced their utter displeasure at the outcome of the event. The vocal masses erupted and these boards were an utter “fuck Bethesda, that was stupid” full paged bulletin board. At the very least, there were a few new plans and items that were available in the treasure hunter event, but overall, it was a let down and negatively received by a large vocal portion of the community. For some reason, and some question this, those same plans aren’t available in this event, like the Croc backpack. There are quite a few players who feel like their opinion on these events does not matter to Bethesda, and to be honest, in my opinion, it seems that Bethesda picks and chooses which uproar it will deal with. Hence, reverting the Camp changes without any response to event reactions except those changes to the amount needed for each type.
---
The last group is what some call the Cheerleaders. They tend to defend Bethesda which inflames the masses who feel they’ve been done wrong, and the posts grow and grow as each side tends to try an one up the other.
---
My personal opinion is that Bethesda fucked up. They know they did. They aren’t going to admit it in some large apology. But they know. And not event is fucked up. They do get it right sometimes. Fasnacht and Meat Week are fantastic with all sorts of dumb shit and shenanigans that go on.
---
Bethesda looked like it was turning a corner with Wastelands and moving in a positive direction. Just lately it seems that Bethesda has been making an impressive amount of missteps here. Fixing things no one wanted, breaking things that were working and core gameplay for many, bad event planning, lack of communication, 1st promises not met, etc. a lot of veterans like myself...might be starting to wonder if it was worth sticking around, and is it really going to ever get better like they promised. I think a lot of them  are starting to become a bit more vocal now.
---
Don’t panic.
---
Indeed, I tried a magazine with my normal buffs and drugs and I was able to hit her in the face for 25k a hit was crazy.
---
Because you can pick them up for free in gazillion locations
---
Sooooo. Concrete in 48 hours did 4.2 million. And cork in 24 hours did 65 million. I’m gonna call bullshit I think.
---
Totally understandable on the PC front honestly. What PC master race folks like myself fail to recognize is that no matter how you spin it, consoles are more user friendly and provide 70% of a games potential visual quality for less than half the cost of a good computer. But since playing games is what I spend the vast majority of my free time on, I dont mind dealing with the occasional troubleshooting simply because im a perfectionist and would rather not play a game at all than play it with anything less than the maximum quality and performance available at the time and that is often to my own detriment, but you can imagine why it feels bad investing a lot of money amount into a hobby when no amount of money can buy you an organized ecosystem for all video games that runs on a single platform. It would be like buying a mountain bike and finding out only certain brands are allowed on certain bike paths. What really kills me is Nintendo releasing their incredible games on hardware significantly less powerful than the phone im typing on. When playing switch games i feel like i payed a 300 dollar tax to play beautiful games on what might as well be a kindle. Unfortunately as a fan of RPG's Sony has me by the balls. Between Bloodborne, Nioh 2, the Demon Souls remake, ghost of tsushima and more it feels like Xbox has completely given up on making anything other than shooters for dude-bro frat types that have been talking about fucking my mom since we were all 11.
---
Yeah. When do you want to get on? I will be around all day.
---
That worked thank you!
---
Same, I rarely see anybody in there. 
---
Once I was running around and accidentally shot somebody (I was using VATS). And they were actually pretty cool about it, just gave me the ??? Emote a few times, I gave them some hearts, and we continue to go and murder all the ghouls.
---
While I agree there are lots of things that need to be improved and fixed, I can’t see myself playing this game for 6 months with absolutely zero content being added in that time.
---
Hope you haven’t got Thursday off work but gotta work Wednesday or u might be screwed.
---
Baa Baa Blacksheep. It's one of the few quests surrounding the encryptid mysteries and sheepsquatch. They can be activated by looking at posters and notes at some train stations, or by visiting the taxidermy shop in Lewisburg
---
Doesn't help with the LR with everyone fighting to get that last bit of xp
---
Pretty much.
---
I think partly because there's a limit you can have with you at once?
---
Seeing it in teal life, you suddenly realist it's probably a LOT harder to make a frame that fucked up than to just make a normal frame.
---
Sorry, but like "Ave, true to Caeser" and all..
---
Yup.  All my toons are in the 180-200 lvl.  
---
I stack my xp boosters, no Unyield and one run through west tek get me a lvl up or just a cunt hair away from a lvl up.   
---
I can understand the really high lvl guys complaining but if ur 200 or lower u should be having no problems leveling up.
---
I've gone back to just playing fallout 4
---
Yeah, The seller was posting this link. I didn't post a link to their store cuz I didn't want people buying them or supporting that person.
---
I did get my first legacy weapon from a in-game player shop though. BE15 Gatling Plasma, 21k caps. I was so happy to get it I spent hours just killing everything I could, blowing through all the plasma cores that I had stored up.
---
just buff up your xp bonus, you gain level every fast as long as you can kill npc fast.
---
(you can stack bonus from food, lunchbox, team perk, sleep, INT buff).
---
some events are really generous with xp too (radiation rumble, Line in the sand, air to surface...)
---
However, we need more WestTek/Burrows zones. Maybe some instanced ones...
---
So there’s people that have it from last meat week? Is it craftable for others camps?
---
New players are coming to fallout but they are young and demanding help when they should just go back to fortnight or learn to play as a true survivor.
---
I'm fine with the idea if it had some purpose
---
I always though that they should just make the chassis to have mods like under armor ( shielded, protected, etc.) I dont no much about code but I feel like it wouldn't be that hard to implement
---
No, just a really bad bout of insomnia since sunday...
---
Yep because it's only on Steam.
---
Not really I tried everything. I don’t know about the blood eagle nest though.
---
How many pints of insomnia did u have Sunday????
---
SB brains will help.  Using inspirational will help.
---
Also lets adding the sharing of reputation
---
Edit: And the sharing of tadpole/possum completion
---
I sent you a friend request :)
---
i still think reintroducing luck based crit chances and altering it so specific weapons have a base crit percentage thats higher than others.
---
so for example a heavy machine gun would have a base crit rating of 0.5% while a non-automatic "one handed" (lets be real we all hold them with both hands even when not aiming unlike good'ol F3/NV) weapons would have a base crit chance of about 3.5% and each point of luck (up to a maximum of 20 luck) would contribute 1% crit chance from each shot.
---
would give a buff to alot more of the niché weapons like commy whacker, single action revolver, slredge hammer, etc while also making more of the while pistol line more viable with the higher base crit chance.
---
then just give non-automatic laser weapons a +5% crit chance so laser rifles, pistols and snipers get a chance to shine and make automatic lasers have a 3% crit chance, plasma pistols and snipers get a 2% crit base bonus while automatic and flamer only gets 1% because plasma is already quite viable when automatic/gatling where as lasers are not.
---
Pfft. No deal. The BoS are at least offering that up if they get what they want.
---
This is true buddy. For us who give freely, you aint taking shit :)
---
Have you been on a private team lately?
---
Once they've been build in your camp, you can only move your camp to get rid of them. But even moving will still keep them in your camp-budget.
---
It's a well known exploit to get ammo on the cheap &amp; easy.
---
I play that game and have for a long time, I can agree there was some "backlash" as they weren't able to fix every single bug but all in all it was a big improvement and fixed all major bugs I had encountered, something similar would be great for FO76.
---
They'd probably need to focus a bit on basic game infrastructure to make it easier to implement new content as well, so we won't have as many bugs with subsequent updates or they'll at least be able to fix them more easily. With all that the player base would probably see huge growth if they manage to get consistent content out afterwards.
---
Cork is used for ultralight armor mods.  I’ve had it tagged for search for ages.  Scrip armor becomes dramatically lighter with an UL mod.  
---
I turned in 10k cork myself.
---
There is? I never knew there was a limit to carrying PA.
---
The plot turns!
---
True, but they just do neither and don't give a crap. How about that?
---
I usually go for camps with low amount of plans in the hopes they are only keeping the rare plans and dumping all the common. 10-30 plans I’ll go take a peak, camps with 300 plans I’ll check out if it’s not out of my way.
---
The same is true of nearly every weapon though and they all have plans.
---
Yay! Finally I can share all my erotic fanfiction with the world!
---
The plan is heeellllaaaa rare.
---
But I can craft them too. In fact I’ve got about 30 I need to toss in a vendor
---
Course, it should be pointed out. You get one cork per weapon. It's possible to use a magazine to lower the costs of making the weapons and then scrapper to increase.
---
I think it's 6 or 8 you can carry with you at once. Likely since you can use them as portable (temporary) walls.
---
RDR has two random encounters almost exactly like this. One is a farm where you make friendly and get invited in to join a couple for a meal. And obviously, you're the meal. It's a slow and creepy build, involving incest. Another is an entire faction of cannibals who have a cave in the woods and randomly ambush you in the woods.  With environmental clues all over the place about them.
---
Outer worlds has almost the exact same encounter as the farm in RDR. You go on a fetch quest. The family there welcomes you in. You ask how they survived in the wild where everyone else failed. They dodge your questions. You look around in the house and eventually find the body they are feeding off of. And the lines are obvious setup almost identical to the RDR lines of stay for dinner, you;'re the dinner. 
---
RDR does it the best. Its immersive world and visuals are far better than 76.
---
Thanks, my vendors are working again
---
Of course it's fudged. It's most likely one big marketing stunt to tout out a massively falsified player count. This entire donation event is most likely going to end with a "Look at how many players have donated" blog/announcement, with a bit of "pride and accomplishment" sprinkled on top.
---
Don’t worry, those are the camp vendors that I visit for that exact reason. I also put no more then 20-30 plans up at once. And I swap out any common plans every weekend with the plans I found over the week and dump all the old ones at a train station.
---
Cosmetic i think
---
Wait, you shouldn't play an instrument at the start of OVN?
---
It's still going to mainly mounted head plans.
---
Thats great news man, happy vending ;)
---
Different thing.. You learn (and need to) mods from scrapping weapons and need different level weapons while leveling etc. PA Chassis don't have level on them and you only need 1 or 2 of them.
---
Glad to see you’re being part of the solution.
---
"When education is not liberating, the goal of the oppressed is to become to oppressor."
---
Would absolutely love this.
---
They don't just appear out of thin air. You or someone you were on a private team with built them. You can move your camp to delete them but they will still take up budget.
---
It could happen if they split their development process into two teams; new content development and support/bug fixing.  They have fixed some long-running bugs like God Mode, so they're not doing nothing over there.  Be great if the support/bug fixing team would work more closely with the community to prioritize top issues.
---
Um. I have a legacy weapon that I got a long long time ago that I no longer use. But even if I did... it's hardly overpowered or"unfair".... and honestly... I'd like to keep it. Just to have it because I got it legit and it means something. 
---
(Instigating Gauss Rifle with exploding bullets, in case you were wondering)
---
I did one of these once and we literally couldn’t start it because the enemies spawned in the ground
---
I am good without it.  Only would want it if it's legit and clearly its not.  I got the raider armco thing tho finaly.  Damn dailies wouldn't show up at first.
---
Baahahahahaha, I can just picture him self importantly demanding his own washroom 😄😄😄👌
---
That was most likely someone with a jacked-up melee build one-hitting her before she became legendary. Now why someone would do that on a public server is a mystery for the ages.
---
Do you still listen to the radio when you’re in the car driving? If you do then you’ll see that it’s kinda their job. If not then that’s great. But still this is a radio station in a video game. It *should* have a DJ.
---
I'd definitely like the bullion items to be shared. No damned way I'm going through the SS grind more than once, seeing as I'm at least 200 modules in &amp; still haven't had the luck with RNG to get an appropriate set. I got moderately lucky with the Gauss Shotty getting an Instigating within 3 rolls but may still try for something else if I ever am granted the SS arms I need.
---
No way I'm doing this all over on the Alts.
---
Yea, my only concern about that boss is the 8-player max instance. What if 9 players show up to the event? The first group of 8 will be fine since they have 8 players but then that leaves that final person in a single group of their own....
---
Does anyone think they are tracking the actual numbers? They manually put a an invented number everyday and if the goal its not met either they lower the goal or higher the contribution, the players cannot do no even have access to the data. It's all fake
---
Yessss
---
I couldn't agree more with the title.   60+ wall mounts are just a waste of time,  "F" the travel expenses.
---
I just create a new character. A new character should have enough easy leveling for about 5 days. Around lvl 5 - 6 is when it takes more than one story mission to level up. After that, delete and start over.
---
If you go to the vendor bots in the whitesprings resort. They have lost of plans for sale. I'm bout to know all the buyable power armour plan. Just the RNG ones to go.
---
Yeah I probably will then.
---
Nah they could do that with more realistic numbers for cork. They just have to point out how much we over donated for steel.
---
There's challenges for killing legendaries at the moment.
---
Yeah, Rockstar generally does a good job of making an immersive world. If I remember correctly, your talking about the incest hillbillies? Right? Or am I thinking of the wrong one? And I also remember the wolf cave one, a bunch of naked men attacking you.
---
Maybe they are trying to pick up a pile that you are standing on.
---
Not all the time. Get lots of 1 stars from her. Latest item was a one star auto-stim leather arm 😂🤣😅
---
And learn/ get nothing from scrapping them, other than to just "delete" 10lbs of carry/ stash weight
---
Totally agree, the first part of this game is the most fun and challenging.
---
Congrats. Got a junkie's Ex gatling plasma back before they were legacy (and energy weapons sucked arse) out of a vendor for 300 caps. Slapped a scatter barrel on it, and it's what I use when I want everything in that general direction to die.
---
I don't think that lines up with the previous day's. I think they are tracking it, but they have to have a helper to modify lol
---
Sorry you took criticism of a game you enjoyed personally.
---
You seem more worried about the tone I used to discuss a game's many flaws, than the actual criticisms of those flaws, and the fact that it was a response to your comment stating the game was a solid buy. 
---
It feels alot like the reason you found it condescending is because you suggested it based on the length of 2 play throughs, who made it, and that it's largely bug free, and my criticisms were just far more in depth and you didn't like that. 
---
So now I will be condescending. The reason you don't want to debate it isn't because of me. It's because your opinion to suggest it as a buy was based on flimsy reasons, and you just don't have the depth of opinions to change my mind or even present reasonable counter arguments to my criticisms.
---
Have a good day.
---
Plus the reward for concrete was a flag while the reward for cork is a double daily weekend. Pretty obvious why cork is doing better than concrete did.
---
I was aiming higher than shins.
---
Yeah, it has certainly put an incentive on being a dick.
---
I feel you. And i can not find people with manners... they always bump into me, no matter where I am picking up loot...
---
PLANS!!!
---
Probably.  I accept them to help people fast travel, which I do myself sometimes. That's a bummer. Have the devs acknowledged it?
---
100% agreed. Biggest worry I have at this point is that they just won't capitalize on it and we'll end up with something very bland or more of the same sort of "testing the waters" kind of stuff. It seems pretty unlikely to me that they'll do something ambitious enough to do worse than that this quick after those last big updates. Then again I have said some pretty similar things about games that went on to do pretty much exactly that so fingers crossed
---
"Beta"
---
Did you say a hat? You son of a bitch I’m in.
---
It's not the only way. If I recall, a user posted that you can do the quest with no issues on a private server. Which means either pay for FO1st, or find someone that will let you on their server for 20 minutes.
---
oh sweet, just got on the guy I need em on. ty
---
Maybe fewer ghouls spawn if you make the wendigo appear sooner? I'd like to know also.
---
After this season ends I might switch to ESO. I played it for about a week when it launched on Xbox but got distracted with other stuff
---
Sure add me I'll buy some.  I know the plan only drops from project paradise.  I dont mind paying for them at all
---
I got a low level random on my team yesterday and was going to make him or her some missile turrets... To defend their sad little camp... No can do. I was so bummed
---
I'm confused about the instrument thing in ovn too. Please elaborate why it's not the thing to do.
---
Entitled much? Go play a single player game.
---
I had over 1k cork legit, before sold a bunch for caps
---
(Golfballs)
---
Hey good on them if that's the case but damn who the hell doops cork? Like how much other shit do you have to doop before you're like "welp I guess all that's about left is to doop an obscene amount of cork"
---
Ha that made me genuinely chuckle a little bit instead of just breathing heavy out my nose
---
Aaah, yea, I thought that was a possibility, too. Probably a bit of trolling and/or he's not the brightest bulb in the box, cause the Whitespring robots, to me, are way more efficient and probably closer to the kills he was dragging my way.
---
I once ran to the robots for help when I was low on stimpaks and getting chased by a legendary. Got the xp for it after the assaultrons took care of it, lol.
---
Last weekend I saw a camp with like 3 weapons, 2 plans, a few hundred rounds of ammo. I went and checked it out and I was shocked all the weapons were high end, both plans were for the fixer and all the ammo was .45 and 5.56. I bought an 3star AA fixer from them for relatively cheap, about 7000caps. Best surprise I had in the last few months in the game.
---
They did this in Ultima Online. You could write in books and leave them lying around for others to find.
---

---
My bloody Hw/Explo/PA build. Note that I have a second account that I dual client with, so I always have group bonuses and can share my choice of “extra” perks (often Bloody Mess if I’m by myself, but in public groups I’m usually nice and share the 15%XP card.) I run Ultracite with Emergency Protocols, and I managed to make myself a jetpack arm before that got made legacy. 
---
I usually run ballistics, but the energy weapon weight is there for fusion cores (kind of wasted since I don’t need more than 4 at a time) and now 2mm EC for my Gauss Minigun. But I carry a shitload of guns and ammo. At any one time I’m probably carrying 15 heavy weapons, 3 melee weapons, 150 40mm grenades, 20+ missiles, 10+ mininukes, ~50-80 of various grenades and mines (that I never use, lol), and ~20k rounds of various .308, flamer fuel, 5mm, 2mm, Ultracite .50, Ultracite plasma cartridges (plasma caster).
---
It's on Gamepass isn't it? You can do a trial for really cheap.
---
The user interface badly needs a complete rethink &amp; redesign from scratch.  It's been like 10+ years since Fallout 3 where they introduced it as a one-size-fits-all compromise for PC &amp; console players that ends up badly shafting PC players.
---
Most glaringly for a multiplayer game there's no way to actually trade item for item in this game.
---
I wonder if they have any automated tests at all. I guess they must have some but it seems like it’s not policy to add a test for every bug fix since they so often regress even fairly recent fixes. Of course they could just be updating the expected test results since it’s too time consuming to work our how to keep the new code without regressing existing behaviour. 
---
Software development is hard, and I do feel that given what this game is doing compared to say RDR2 it’s getting a rough ride. Saying that maybe I’ve just been lucky in not encountering, or perhaps noticing, many bugs.
---
Or you know, just stand off to the side for 5 minutes and wait until everyone leaves like I do.
---
Nah, my alt is a mule account. My main generally stays well muled and unencumbered.
---
Having to death warp my mule all over the map was an interesting endeavor is all.
---
Holy shit!!!  I’m sorry to hear that brother
---
That's about the stupidest thing I've read in a while. It's all a big conspiracy because they said "if X conditions are met by the 15th then Y event will take place on the 20th". 
---
Planning ahead is a new concept for you?
---
Oh, it's like one of those chinese factory security cam videos that OSHA hates.
---
Just make a new toon, go talk to duchess and spend all mats throwing random crap in your camp and it levels you.. 10 mins top. then delete it, and do same next day
---
Playing instruments spawns the boss which can end the event. They'd rather farm the mobs for exp.
---
Excuse you?
---
Yes, if you make the Wendigo appear sooner, there's less ghouls. We used to be able to farm this event for 15+ minutes until Bethesda nerfed it and changed the timer to 8 minutes. But people still want to milk it for as many ghouls as possible for XP.
---
Good to know! I still have much building to do with my house, and don't want constant interruptions.
---
Although I did build there knowing it would most likely be nuked from time to time. Those I don't mind, since it's just the hazzard of setting up base on Whitespring. I figured I'd just jump worlds if a nuke was headed my way, but overall worth the pretty and convenient location.
---
Playing instruments will spawn the boss which can end the event. They'd rather farm exp.
---
Maybe send damage or an overpowered melee build.
---
Why would you accept private team requests when there are public teams?
---
2000caps for a 3 star fixer? A nocturnal bash dmg 250 dr while aiming? I found a good one for 7000 caps and I thought it was a deal
---
Don’t pipe pistols cost screws?
---
So u don’t have to click across to a tab?  Entitled just reached a new milestone
---
There have been several glitches and bugs over the past 2 years that have allowed people to go over the build limit in their camps.
---
And I'd rather my Treasury Notes and the Event Completed for my Challenges.
---
ok. bye.
---
That sucks.
---
thats sounds about right my bloody mole miner gaunt does similar damage and shows about the same in the stats page so not a bug
---
Oh yea, I was already aware that Whitespring is a great nuke location. Every other nuke I see is always located there, but those I don't mind since I can just hop worlds if it happens. I felt the awesome location outweighed the tiny down-side of the occasional nuke.
---
I've walked away from friends without saying a word. I really don't get those posts.
---
....wrong thread?
---
Try doing what u did and eating food buffs, which I believe stack. You’ll double that
---
I think I have an extra stimpak diffuser plan laying around somewhere? When I get home tonight and have stable internet connection, I'll hit you up so I can give it to ya if I do have it, okay? :)
---
I was easily able to make a few cork donations, wasn't the case for concrete so I have my doubts those numbers are fudged in any way.
---
Maybe Bethesda has set the bar this low and I assume complete incompetence, but i honestly don't think they can truly "fix" this game. They can definitely improve content quality and frequency of meaningful content updates but in terms of performance and bugs, I dont think the engine can handle it. Theyve gotta be running into the issues World of Warcraft was having with their engine a few years ago before they reworked a lot of it. I think the foundation upon which 76 is built is so old and unstable that as soon as they try to change anything more fundamental it breaks years of patched together code. In WoW it tooks years for them to update the auction house because the foundation upon which it was built was so old and patched together that random things all throughout the game would break when they internally tested updating it. Part of me strongly believes this is a similar issue in 76. Such that I believe little things like recipes not being able to use multiple ingredient combinations without showing up as separate recipes in the menu is a limitation of the engine and updating that could break way more than they are prepared to patch up.
---
Yeah a buddy of mine hits her for alot too, sounds like you already got alot of the essential buffs going. Eating mutant hound steak, and glowing meat with carnivore will give you around 40% more damage. Then covert operative, mister sandman perk cards etc for more sneak damage and more damage at night.
---
Not a bad idea.
---
pirate hat doesn't clip, but I think it was an Atom Shop item
---
How did they nerf them?
---
I find that the hoppers on the resource gatherers are wayy too small. If I'm not checking my workshops every 10 minutes it feels like I'm losing resources (cause the hoppers are full). 
---
This of course doesn't apply to the slow mining gatherers. Junk/acid/fusion cores have to *constantly* be collected though.
---
isnt there a plasma bolt mod for crossbows now? you could go around as Fallout Chewbacca then
---
Tried moving it to the roof of my camp, she teleported up there and started playing LOL
---
We're through the looking glass...
---
Why even have multiple characters if all the stuff you unlock is shared? I don’t like this idea. I like playing new characters and exploring Appalachia without a cap to my name.
---
Doesn’t explain how it can always rain through a greenhouse dome
---
Try first person view. Chainsaws are basically shredder miniguns without bullets, and that means you get to continue "firing" thru a stagger. It's also much easier to keep on target that way, you do basically double damage.
---
It's not perfect, tho. Jumping and falling cause you to stop attacking, while being in third person you can run and jump like a madman constantly attacking. All this makes chainsaws the only weapon where it's objectively better to switch views frequently.
---
Strange, so you just never have access to your old ones or they come back eventually?
---
I’d ask them if they’re genuinely happy with the increasingly broken mess we have.
---
That is funny, I see allot of people in here saying the prices fed76 gives are too high and then you have the 1-2 who claim it is too low. I personally will go by there prices since caps are mostly useless anyway and if the items are priced at the same value on the site it is a good sign that they are worth about the same trade value anywhere. True, you can get items cheaper from vending machines but only if you are lucky enough to find the items you are after in 1 of those (in my experience most people do not put their good items in the vending machines so you will waste a ton of caps traveling around looking for the gear you want in the machines). Just had someone attempt to sell me items at 2000+ caps higher than the max price on fed76 claiming it is not accurate and while I would not mind paying the max price I will not go over. I offered them items worth the same price instead of caps but they didn't seem to be interested (this is why I suspect they just wanted to rip me off).
---
I just always have. I have been playing actively since BETA and have had no issues with griefing till now. I wont anymore.
---
I just wish it weren't in the tab it's in.
---
Put it next to the heart emote, not in the misc tab where the mothman dance, robot dance, and irradiated emote sit. 
---
Selecting though 4 of them is annoying using a controller.
---
seperate reply regarding perks.
---
honestly they should rename tank killer to something like precise shooting or whatever an allow it to affect ALL non-heavy weapons so we can rework some armor penetrating perks into giving more utility while buffing pistols into a state they'd be useful.
---
i mean look at that one pistol perk [Crack Shot](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Crack_Shot) its awful, more accuracy while aiming? more range? both useless when your aiming since accuracy will be pretty high to begin with.
---
what it COULD do though is improve hipfire and recoil by 20/40/60%, lower VATS cost by 10/20/30% and while aiming down sights gives you 10/20/30% more fire rate.
---
this way it will buff and be useful both inside and outside of VATS while giving a unique feeling for each, so if you prefer aiming down sights you will have a better fire rate while if you prefer VATS shots you will have more shots in VATS before your AP runs dry.
---
it's not just Pistol perks that suck either, just look at [Sniper](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Sniper) , slightly better scope aim and up to 75% longer hold breath? WEAK.
---
just chancing it so its a flat 50% hold breath bonus and instead increasing your scoped control by 20/40/60% and recoil by 15/30/45% while scoped would probably be better for the aspiring sniper than the lame version that exists now.
---
[Modern Renegade](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Modern_Renegade)? more like weak ass renegade.
---
just change it so hipfire and recoil are both improved by 10/20/30% while hip-firing and make it so single shot pistols have a 3/6/9% chance to cripple the target limb and automatic pistols have a 2/4/6% chance to cripple ANY limb so that way pray and spray methods can work well while precise single shots are better rewarded.
---
i came up with these in about 2minutes of being in the bathroom, i mean honestly it isn't hard to come up with SOMETHING better, at least better than the defaults of some perks.
---
perks need to be more about CHOICES and not "oh this perks shit, lets just use this handful instead". ALL PERKS need to be worth weighing what your personal build needs not just some.
---
During the first year of the games launch they twoced reduced both the speed at which it gains resources and the capacity for the extractors to hold it.
---
Therein lies the conflict. Group A wants to use the event to farm exp. Group B wants to knock the event out and move on.
---
I'd rather have the ability to craft specific ammos without needing to make custom receivers for them. IRL you don't have to rebuild a shotgun to put a slug round in it.  You just put a bloody slug round in it. Same with explosive rounds.
---
Legacy weapons are not the same as hacked weapons. 
---
i.e, a bloodied explosive laser rifle? Legacy weapon.
---
Beam splitter handmade? Hacked weapon.
---
"Be the change you want to see."
---
You're part of the problem.
---
Sounds like new execs pushing for "the future" (one that they have their signatures on)
---
Hell of a retcon, sadly I could see Beth doing this. “We know the NCR doesn’t exists yet but...reasons!”
---
I don't buy walls off the atomic shop so i'm not sure if the ones you buy also get cycled out. I imagine they don't, but I can't confirm.
---
They do. At least screws are easy enough to find and people have already been banking them, though.
---
I just got unlucky then and ran into an unfortunate person. I hope my future residence at Whitespring will be as peaceful as yours!
---
Light?
---
When does beta end?
---
It was different before though because there was no other option, unless it’s a friend (which still I’ll use a public team because of the buffs unless we’re planning on building) you shouldn’t accept them because there’s literally no other reason apart from griefing now
---
Wait, really? I'd found it used slightly less than one display case, with the added benefit of it holding 6 total items. 
---
Does it actually use more budget?
---
Mathematically speaking, you only need 800,000 players across all platforms, worldwide, to donate ONCE to get 200 million cork. That's simple math folks. And when you have FO1st people kicking in their stockpiles, the actual number of people who need to donate will drop even lower. There are 268k subcribers just on this Reddit, so the playerbase is likely larger. This means that legitimately achieving the goal isn't at all farfetched, especially since this event is actually worth donating for, unlike concrete.
---
They did something of this nature not long after launch, but half of the stuff they fixed ended up being reverted and new bugs created. It's been up and down, but I guess it at least runs a bit better than at launch.
---
"Side with Foundation" and "Side With Crater" lol
---
I'll be sure to let them know once we reach the  500 million ballistic fiber milestone :)
---
 I completely agree that damage perks need to be moved to perception. That alone would already help balance it out a bit and I doubt it would take much effort to change.
---
Yeah...lesson learned on my part, I guess.
---
Ah. That is pretty obvious. I’m only asking because I just completed “Overseer, overseen” and I have quests with both raiders and settlers about how to break in.
---
That figures. Thanks for theinfo 
---
It feels like it was nerfed too much. 
---
I love the idea of workshops, its a lot of fun watching the defenses you put down take out enemies, but I hate having my collectors full after just 10 minutes.
---
But they stop spawning when there's no music 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
---
noice.
---
The wolf man is his own thing. He''s part of the classic monsters encounters (which were awesomely integrated, imho). He's not a cannibal, really.
---
The incest couple are on a farm that's kind of south east of where the pawn broker is. She's a vixen and he's a heavyset guy.
---
The cannibal clan live near the lumber town. Theres a windy mountain Ridgeline trail just up the hill to its direct west and their caves are in there. You will find stage coaches with bodies they ambushed on trails around it as clues. And they will ambush you from time to time. They also can be found picking bodies of picnickers in the fields along the rive in the middle of the map.
---
From what everyone's saying, I'm happy to see I just got unlucky with an unfortunate encounter.
---
I think we might've picked similar spots! My house is on the creek where there's a tipped-over gondola(or canoe) with two skeletons in it.
---
That's why I never lock anything, even my personal extractors because I know they'll be full again by the time I come home!
---
You can do them all until you hit those quests respectively.
---
Ignoring that is the kind of thing so senseless it screams, "we have no freedom in the development or fixing of our game except when the money people get coked up enough for us to actually sneak in and add some playable game into the game".
---
They don’t need to remove them.  They just need to make the dam changes they promised over a year ago.
---
I wouldn’t, I don’t want to have to grind all new gear again
---
Cool, thank you!
---
10/10 for effort and presentation.
---
No doubt it's annoying AF, I try to stand as far yet still able to collect ..most are inconsiderate AF and have occasionally came across ones who seem to deliberately try and interfere with collecting loot. 😤🤬
---
Honestly it might be true. I had 5k in my stash from scraping laser rifles and I never use it.
---
As a plan hunter, this would be amazing
---
&gt;my high intelligence character,
---
Except you aren't since you're 15 INT below someone using unyielding.
---
They will teleport to their station, but if you block it enough, and provide other seating, she won't get to it as much
---
Oh yeah I remember now.
---
I don't need to clear out junk, I just need a separate wardrobe so I can find my spare armor without digging through four hundred pounds of dirty clothes that I've convinced myself I might want to wear someday.
---
Incorrect.  The fallout wiki specifically states: " Frederick's exact fate appears to be unaccounted for and is not mentioned in any of the tapes during or after Olivia's betrayal. "
---
*Zenimax shareholders disliked that.*
---
Thanks!!!
---
The only thing you mentioned that needs grinding is is the plasma caster which is one item that can be got relatively quick once you complete Wastelanders.
---
Unless you have a full set of Secret Service unyeilding and vanguard, you're not getting the point.  Ordinary UNY and VAN things can be traded for, they don't require grinding.  Each of the 5 pieces of SS armour costs at least 500 bullion.  Want to mod each part? 250 each.  Yet we can only obtain 200 bullion each day, which means sitting with your thumb up your ass until you slowly get all the pieces.
---
Now, say we have all the plans we need, you need 1 Legendary module which is 50 scrip each just to craft one piece of SS armour, and it's effects will be completely random, you cant choose.  Also there's equal chance it will come out 1* instead of the desired 3*.  I friend of mine went through 35 Legendary modules trying to craft a UNY SS chest, and he didn't get a single UNY.
---
And this is only in regards to SS armour not including everything else that's a grind to unlock
---
I feel like the reason you feel the way you do is because you're still relatively early in the game, and you still have things to do.  For the rest of us who have completed damn near everything in the game, between content releases, all we have is the grind, and instead of most games that reward you for your progress, this game just seems to punish. If my goal is creating a UNY SS chest piece, I'll log in, scrip Legendarys to get my 150 scrip, buy 3 Legendary modules and roll the dice.  If i dont get it I cant keep grinding and go for it again, i have to wait until tomorrow, which most likely will be the same result.  What's keeping me playing this game any longer during a session if everything worthwhile is time restricted? There comes a point when there's literally nothing to do other than run around the map for the sake of it, and that gimick wears off quick.
---
&gt;I'm not entirely sure what progress you're all trying to achieve that requires a borderline infinite amount of time to make?
---
The only reason it's 'borderline infinite' is because of the finite cap for most things, just take the example of crafting the SS armour i gave.  Whereas if the caps were raised/removed, grinding wouldn't be as tedious as it currently is
---
Had you been on a team, you could have called for help.
---
Please join teams, everyone. There's not a single downside.
---
Get some adrenaline my man
---
Once I got 4 pts with my ultracite Gatling Laser, but usually it's like 2-3. 😂😂
---
I'm actually doing a 2nd play through and going to side with the settlers. The first time through, they just rubbed me the wrong way
---
I'm sorry but I dont really understand how this is entitled. Wanting stash boxes to be more than just boxes and desks?
---
So funny. A few months ago I said exactly the same and also made a petition. I was downvoted into oblivion
---
The sacrament is the place, I made a little vid
---
[fallout 76 fuel location](https://youtu.be/NQjtxOtuZn8)
---
Get one of those magic weapons, you'll be happy then 😂
---
I think I’m just lucky on the timing because I’ve made like half a dozen of these before but a lot of them were more lot logical and dry and had detailed but reports and stuff like that and nobody wants to read actual facts. Also downvoted to nothing.
---
Really wish they'd do this. Destiny 2 does this and it's amazing.
---
Sounds good, just check if i’m on, and i’ll send ya an invite!
---
Nope.. not there for me. just checked
---
Why are you wandering around an your alt?  Fast travel to an event with someone there and wait for the completion and you get your level.  It's completely painless.
---
I don't bother because despite being over level 300 I can generally level just running the wastelanders dailies and doing a couple events.
---
I have very minimal daily playtime yet somehow I'm having no problems.
---
I have a theory that Beth thinks bugs are content. With every patch they adding new *content* and i more a more convinced with that.
---
Yeah I feel ya. I’m glad this one took off :)
---
How about a free Fasnacht Mask? ;)
---
If they had to have this kind of challenge in the next season I'd say make it to where it's a once a week kinda deal
---
It is a online profile I believe so it will probably save but I am not sure.
---
I'd be surprised if even 20% of the player base is actively participating. The rewards are mediocre. I play daily to finish score stuff, but haven't participated in ATLAs since steel.
---
Game doesn't ever remind me to do it, I never see anyone there, and there's score to grind, dang it. 
---
No one is surprised at players being able to gather steel, literally among the most common scrap of all. Cork? Total fudge. 
---
Am guessing they had been showing "real" numbers up until they saw concrete and had to drop the goal post by more than 130+ million concrete; now they've decided to fudge it all xd
---
Until I'm blue in the face. The "rewards" are not the junk. The rewards are what we get for getting to the goals. Cork goal's reward is a double score weekend. 
---
So. To answer your question... people aren't mad at the goals... they're mad at the little box of junk they're getting for turning in the 250 of whatever junk they turn in to reach those goals.
---
Basically, someone cried about something before looking past the end of their nose and the rest of them jumped on without hesitation. Typical.
---
Your characters are stored server-side rather than locally on your PC, you will not lose anything by uninstalling and re-installing the game.
---
I'm going to hit 100 before the weekend.  :(
---
This would be cool, but I wouldn't want them to waste resources doing it when there are so many other things that need work.
---
Now that is a coal-ition I can get behind:
---
what happened to the world of gaming?  why do you need "incentive" to keep playing a game? it being a game and enjoying it should be incentive enough. don't enjoy it?  don't play it.
---
I wasn't being entirely serious with the mincraft reference, as i say it just jumped in to my head lol
---
There's a saying i think is relevant to this
---
"Ignore everything before the word 'but'" lol
---
Imagine deleting all your characters when there is a simple fix 😭🥺😬 ouch
---
See, I'm the opposite, I've only had FO1st for 3 months, but I use scrapper, and I loot everything that isn't nailed down. Glass bottles, pencils, golf balls, EVERYTHING. I believe I had about 2500 cork in my scrapbox last time I checked. Probably way more now. Just imagine the vast quantities of resources you would have if you gave the wasteland a thorough pillaging.
---
Funny how everyone preaches this, when more so often they've done the same.
---
They can try to deny it. But we all know they do it too.
---
Need some help?
---
The South Shall Rise Again!
---
Not that it’ll make you feel any better, but Stranglerheart is pretty worthless after the nerf; just build for T-65
---
Nice video! Very interesting that there’s so much hidden down there, especially the npc
---
I dont even do dailies. I find they are way to tedious at this point.
---
I just login, do the challenges, then either do queen, or visit west-tek and whitesprings.
---
I feel like such an asshole when I use it, it feels like the "wow" chat button in For Honor
---
There is probably more cork than people think because there are a lot of new/low levels players from console and game pass and they're scrapping pipe weapons from low level enemies and ending up with cork they have no use for.
---
As this is an event that benefits lowbies, this works out pretty well.
---
But the problem is getting more cork than what people have accumulated is very slow.
---
In all likelihood if we're at 65M now it's because people gave all their stores and now we won't see any real movement as getting a lot more cork isn't realistic.
---
Sugar grove.

Sugar drove.
---
Some gameplay changing effects would be fun. Ricochet bullets: bullets bounce off walls and objects. Piercing bullets: bullets penetrate through multiple enemies if they're lined up. Proximity detonation: turns your explosive payload (like a fat man) in to a mine.
---
the last several i've had in my vendor have went for that. Now.. it is entirely possible that *some* people might think it's the plan from the mole event. But i doubt all of them do.
---
i never seen an animated damage perk card though
---
U want seperate ones for each tab. Or have I read that wrong?
---
Nah man. It's for the RP's. I get it. it's niche, but there would be a demand for such functionality.  Same as having different beds, sleeping bags, and building bundles.
---
Using Formula P will give you this effect you should try it
---
Sorry for asking, but even being lvl 140 I never heard about Lode Baring Tokens (I know that there is an event with this name but not sure if I ever took this one) and also never heard about overseer tokens. Where do we get those and what we can get with? Thank you in advance.
---
We’ll see that’s where I messed up. I have had game since beta. Played the main story beat it then stopped playing until October but I swear I’m still learning stuff. Like I just started using scrapper a month ago. I never messed with to many perks when I first started playing being I just used whatever weapon and I used the carry weight glitch back then but they patched it and I was like 3k over weight and we couldn’t trade back them so I dropped almost everything or sold to vendor bots. Which included legacy weapons being I didn’t know they would be taken out. Lol but what I’m getting at is I just started messing around with perks and redoing everything and using different ones. So I’m sure if I used scrapper perk this whole time I would have more and also if I had my bloodied rifles back then I would’ve scrapped more being I use to do melee and never used guns if I didn’t have ammo. So I see what you mean
---
I rarely use throwables, and usually sell everything but a few plasma grenades. I hate getting floater grenades. I had like 40 lbs worth the other day, so I just started throwing them as fast as possible until I ran out. I felt so much better afterwards. Since then I start throwing them as soon as I see a couple in me inventory.
---
Exactly Having a ammo container for ammo, wardrobe for apparel, Fridge for food and a gun locker for weapons,
---
i go for commie balls
---
I saw the holotape on sale at the military wing vendor and bought it... only to find out that I wasted 1000+ caps because I already had it. Now I’ve got two of ‘em! LOL
---
Ugh. Everquest. I ran a small guild back in 2001ish and I had people who would post on our guild forum every so often that they were going to quit the guild. Saying they were unhappy that we didn't do a raid for their epic, or if they didn't have enough to roll on a drop from a raid, or whatever reason. I would give them 24 hours to do it, then un-guild them myself. I don't have time for that garbage. If you want to quit: then quit. No one's going to stop you and better yet, no one cares.
---
There’s a few stash boxes tho and different things. I mean there’s a car now isn’t there
---
commie whacker for encrypted. paddleball for SBQ.
---
1x Scrap item = 1000000x Scrap items. Makes no difference.
---
Oh, fucking great. You might be the one person that actually had that much, and what did you do? You sold them, you greedy bastard. 😂😂
---
At this point, I'd take anything in terms of radio. My sanity can only handle so much of the same music. I usually just keep the radio off and listen to podcasts while I play now.
---
I see you are cultured !
---
damn, maybe some of the devs are helping us out.
---
You really don't need blocker.
---
I haven't played online that.  Imo it feels slow and chunky.  Impressive game though
---
Been here since day one (beta) and it's never been "unplayable".
---
Pc?
---
Hell yeah !
---
You can put her guitar and chair at the very edge of your camp, so that part of the front of the chair is red but you can still place it. For some reason, she won’t sit in it if it’s too close to the camp boundary
---
Rename them.
---
Don't worry its only 150 atoms for each rank in the legendary run. You can just buy your way to it for 15000 atoms /s
---
Here is one. 800+ hours and I hope all dupers, hackers and other cheaters would get castrated by dull sheep shears.
---
Commie Whacker, it doesn't need ammo and every day is a good day for whacking some commies 😁.
---
Where can the paddleball be found?
---
All of the nuclear winter bugs are new and legitimate.  They suck bad.
---
You get your atoms on the day you purchased the subscription the original month. Bought on the 20th, receive your atoms on the 20th every month if not the day after.
---
Not really. We have 268k players on this reddit alone. You only need 800k people to donate once each to get 200 million cork. And that's not even counting the FO1st people like myself, who have boatloads of the stuff. I think I had 2500 cork at my last count, and I have only had FO1st for two months. Brute force of numbers alone makes this event possible, but having thousands of players with bottomless scrapboxes makes it very achievable. If even 1/5th of the subscribers on this reddit (lets round that to 50k people) have FO1st, and they have on average 2500 each, only 300k regular players need to donate once to achieve it.
---
You finished WEEKS EARLY.
---
Had you just been "enjoying the game" you would have completed anyway.
---
You did this to yourself and now you're blaming Bethesda for your own actions.
---
Camden park ,
---
Ok. thank you.
---
Good ol faithful
---
Maybe that’s how 68 million got donated in a day. Or Bethesda won’t allow us to fail and the number was actually south of 2 million
---
breaking down pipe rifles and globes can go a long way
---
I need to look harder then. Thank you.
---
Except Lone Wanderer doesn't work. 20% damage reduction and greatly increased AP regen are huge losses for my build...
---
haha nothing better than some commieballs 
---
but jokes aside i think the paddleball could be somewhat effective whereass the commiewacker is basically garbage right?
---
I have given near 1,000 cork. I plan on coming close emptying my stash box this week. I can't imagine I am alone in this, nor am I on the high side of things.
---
That was great! I'd definitely watch other episodes!
---
They exist like any other card, but not all cards are unlocked until 50. So some dmg cards would be harder to get, still, it make for a harsher survival game and i kinda dig it if im honest haha
---
Tybber. I love you.  &lt;3
---
Nope.
---
They're the omitted effects from Fallout 4 like "freeze on crit" and "20% more damage"
---
Oh you have to spend 50 tokens to get it
---
I don't even understand why those are a drop to begin with. The plans, as well as a complete suit, are given as a quest reward.
---
no it seems since wastelanders after meatpiles sit in a server for long enough the piles break down into the individual items.
---
Same. But you all are still giving Bethesda money, even though the game isn't being fixed. So what reason does Bethesda have to improve themselves (serious question)?
---
They are both joke weapons , I suppose the paddle ball is better
---
I said to hell with it lol
---
Awful idea, but then so were the cards in the first place.  When the foundation you build on is a pile of crap...
---
Oooo. I’m saving up for the Mr Fuzzy suit. But I will get that paddle ball after.
---
I have the same trying to find the high tech lights plan
---
Yeah, it's a fun weapon. A lot of people used to use them along with the ripper when over repairing them buffed the damage. I wish the chainsaw dropped as a legendary and the ripper drop higher than level 40. I was lucky to get a legendary ripper from the V94 raid reward chest before it closed.
---
Absolutely, but they all function the same. as opposed to having dressers for clothes, desks for notes, etc. I don't think it's a good spend on resources, but I can understand why people might want it.
---
Yeah I think that was one of their attempted fixes for the bug. Which makes me wonder if they think its related to power armor from the logging data they gathered.
---
The challenge autocomplete bug does date back to the patch that made big fundamental changes to the way the power armor system works "under the hood". That was the patch one week after nuclear winter was released, which is why a lot of people (myself included) always thought the bug was related to nuclear winter.
---
I'm on now if you want a plan :) IGN: Nukathulhu
---
The X amount of a stacked object has as much impact as 1 of that object.
---
This event has 0 effect on stability.
---
We already have proof that bethesda put in the extra concrete that we didn’t have just so we’d get the flag, I don’t see why they wouldn’t do that here
---
Yeah, PC
---
I do it on purpose too, ONLY if it’s already been done by someone at the event. Once somebody ruins it, nobody gets the prize I guess. Except me
---
Reddit flair. You can set it on the sub
---
Who told you??!!?
---
&gt; if they didn't have enough to roll on a drop from a raid
---
it’s been forever since I’ve thought of DKP or anything like it.  I know I get all neckbeardy, but people have it so good in FO76 when EVERYONE gets a chance to get a drop from a legendary kill.
---
What he said about guns, and yes about the perk swap. Gatling guns almost never need reloading (they fire slow) so speeding up their reload isn’t too helpful; 50cals *will* burn through their mag “fairly” quick, but at 9 rounds a second a 250 box still lasts 25 seconds of full auto.  They do have an atrociously long reload though (something like 5 seconds baseline). Speed demon and a 15% reload legendary are rather helpful on the 50cal.
---
I don't know if the event is available yet, this was literally a random encounter and no event was triggered during it.
---
True Responder.
---
Hmmm I think I have that one luckily but it seems there may be more that are changed
---
Might have something to do with the fact that they don’t exist yet and won’t be formed for another 83 years :/
---
I was more trying to make a joke than anything... though in a greenhouse dome there could still be issues with the sealant keeping the glass in place and it could bead up drip from there.
---
Back to entitled so not having to click a button to change a tab. It’s a lot of code and resources for something that really isn’t going to improve QOL in the game. I’d much rather the sort things like the fast travel and trade bugs out first. How annoying are they?
---
Same, I usually join groups for events or to talk with friends, but  lone wanderer is extremely useful for melee builds
---
\^this\^
---
YES! Finally passed the quest!
---
Exactly the same situation for me, the door was closed on my 2nd run and then it worked with the analysing. I should add that they have been closed on earlier attempts also that didnt work, so its not a guarantee.
---
Nope
---
Ditto, I try not to, but there have been people who I have completely ghosted after something they did to someone else.
---
that makes sense, i never really looked into those animated cards i may have to take a look through mine and see if theres any damage card i didnt notice
---
yeah i know what you mean, i currently started to try out different builds 
---
i made a build that only uses unarmed and paintrain whilest in powerarmor and it was a lot of fun
---
really feels like a fresh game once youre not oneshotting anything anymore :D
---
They’re faking numbers because they aren’t gonna spend money to make new assets only for them to not be used lol. They can’t afford to this game isn’t really rolling in players rn
---
Theory time. Fallout 5 is in the making and it’s gonna be a true AAA game with wicked next gen graphics, optional multiplayer, no micro-transactions *wipes tear* a huge world twice the size of fallout 4, long and interesting main quest with lots of fun side quest. And 76 sucks so much oooon purpose
---
thanks! just got it
---
This reminds me of that Jurassic Park scene, where that guy who has the fake shaving cream container says "Don't say my name" and Newman says "Dodson! Dodson! We've got Dodson here! See, nobody cares." Replace Dodson with "quitter".
---
That's how I feel when I see these posts. If you want to quit, then do it. No amount of Reddit posts with people threatening to quit will make Bethesda magically release *your* ideal version of Fallout 76.
---
The metallic sound of a shovel is the best.  I got a 1\* Bloodied Power Fist on XBox the other day and tried it out last night.  It was okay but I was sporting a shotgun build.  I guess I need to try the perks to get the right feel of the power behind it.
---
That would be reddit flairs, just little tags that subreddits can set up that users can apply to themselves.
---
If you are on mobile you may not be able to change it, however if you are on PC you can edit your flair using the edit flair button on the right in the sidebar.
---
Honestly, I've only done that event about 3 times. Mostly because every time the other players ignored the instruments and were just farming exp. And at the time I was trying to finish the event.
---
well i knew that none of them are good but i never used a paddleball thats why i was asking :D
---
empath exists and herd mentality can give you up to +4 to all stats 
---
plus people share perks
---
I can't get past 8k damage. My mole miner gauntlet is not + strength though. I would be interested in hearing top damage numbers people get now.
---
This wasn't an old corpse though, I could see actual items fly out of this legendary mob as we killed it, as well as the confetti and chunks of it blowing up. Then when I went to loot a piece, it was empty, but I did find a piece of the meat and some of the junk that that type of mob typically drops. The legendary item I could not locate on the ground any where near it tho.
---
No. But if you plan to reinstall to steam you will not have your atoms.
---
Welcome to the world of consoles? Every time I go to cook or dilute chems I just pull my phone out and mash A.
---
I bought my subscription on the 5th :/
---
I went to go donate last night, when I opened my scrapbox I had exactly 250 cork, on the nose. No way in hell I’m donating unless I go try to farm for it.
---
You could rock up with 3 of your friends to do the event and if there's space for only 3 the 4th person will be placed in their own instance and that will then fill. And so on and so on.
---
You can run an alt through the questline pretty easily in under 30-60 minutes.
---
Blame the duper’s for that. Everyone has high end bloodied fixers or melee weapons and lots have exploding plasma gats and flamers. Events are a free for all now
---
I see them in peoples camps for sale fairly often.
---
It'd be nice if they could confirm it for release - since it sounded like something they were still developing.
---
You lose your photos
---
Literally cut off half my family in one fell swoop and never spoke to them again. Didn't make an announcement on the way out lol
---
Yup I do that
---
you can just create a new character, rush the wayward quest to get the mask and transfer it to your main character. That's what I did because I sided with duchess and didn't know that exclusive mask existed.
---
Or, ya know, you could get good?
---
You lose photos
---
I’d personally skip One Gun Army. You don’t want to stagger the Queen; everything else dies so damn fast to a proper B HW build that staggering them is rather meaningless.
---
Ballistic heavy weapons have crazy durability, only enhanced by being Bloodied (you use far less ammo/cause far less degradation), I don’t run Gunsmith anymore (but I do run explosives). If you run energy HW (I don’t generally recommend it, I do occasionally only to burn off extra cores) it may be more valuable to you.
---
Otherwise pretty solid. This is my B HW/Explo/PA build- https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f634e86&amp;d=sq2s32sr2eh2ib4ip2a72a04l71sw2s22pq1pe2p00ce0cu2l20lu2s12ir2
---
Well fuck, everyone but Lone Wanderer Perk users then
---
I don’t think we need more power, not until we get bigger challenges.  Even on my crappier builds, there’s not much of a challenge. My worst build is my High CHA, Non-Bloodied, Shotgun build and other than getting unlucky from an assaultron or Yao gaui, I’m not in any risk for dying (things just take more bullets to kill).  
---
Before we start getting 4 or 5 star legendaries, we need some content that actually challenges us with what we currently have.
---
Yeah, no, that's bullshit.
---
You can equip and un-equip emotes in the Atom store.
---
I like spamming them into blood eagle locations. They panic and run around frozen and on fire. It's funny to me.
---
Yes but there's no easy way to transfer it when you don't have friends or private server.
---
It's one of the reasons I played a Shadow Knight in EQ. If it was a NEC/SHD or a PAL/SHD item, I usually got it if we tied in raid points because I could pull and off-tank adds. Or, if I was the only one in the raid - which was often, I would get it for the minimum of 1 point.
---
Oh now that I know I will continue to do it
---
Does anyone actually believe half the shit Bethesda says? I for one don’t believe for a second that they make their staff play their games once a week. I didn’t believe them when they said NPCs weren’t going to be a part if 76. It was clearly a design decision to get 76 out as soon as possible. I didn’t believe them when they said mods will be part of the game. I didn’t believe them when they said they delayed Wastelanders, and any other updates for 6 months, to work on bugs. I didn’t believe then when they said the stash limit is limited for server stability reasons. I sure as shit do not believe them for one second when they said they have multiple studios working on this game. Absolutely no way that this game would be in the state it is now if they had even one whole studio working on this game. It’s clear that this game is run by a skeleton crew and half the shit Bethesda talks about with 76 is straight up lies so we don’t abandon their cash cow.
---
Empath and strange in numbers make a nice boost on teams tho
---
I've done it countless times and it seems lately they eventually stop spawning when there's no music...
---
It still shows up at Watoga. Seeing it in the vendor list after a dozen server hops the other day was the happiest I’ve felt in months. You’ll get that feeling, too....
---
I meant New vegas.  Rex was in New vegas
---
What would you even use it for?
---
Where do you even see your subscription info? I should be starting my second month but haven't seen it charged yet? Forget how I paid last month 😬
---
It is auto-created when you launch the game.
---
Right! Like, at the end of the day, we all know the metas of the game. Yeah you can one shot most everything with your beefy builds but this just makes for awesome story and gameplay. They'd be totally random stories too, and i think thats hilarious 😆
---
What does it say about the world when we don’t have enough money to pay for communist music? 🧐
---
Hmm, I'd rather win the event but I guess everyone has their way of playing...
---
Crit bonus damage plus broken as game.   
---
 a long time ago there was a way to get into the 1000s for specials and it was stupid you could one shot everything melee and gain levels like mad.  I can say the highest damage I have ever seen is a 1 shot queen when the server was all there waiting so 18-20 people. I am not talking sneak attack, dude ran up jumped when she took flight and hit her dead.
---
No. It’s not that at all. Scrap items are a number followed by a number, with the second number telling the game how many of the first number you have. That’s why instead of a list that’s thousands of acid long, you just see **Acid (1037)**. If you’re having issues with crashing while looking at your inventory, it’s because of non-stackable items. Weapons and armor. Weapons don’t stack. That’s why when you do Line in the Sand and go to scrap everything you see a list of a hundred 10mm pistols.
---
If I'm not mistaken, the queen dropped the plans since launch. They then added them as a reward in that quest line. And just never went back and removed them from the queen.
---
Believe what you want.
---
And all the songs
---
Pfff.
---
I donated 500 of the 575 total cork I've collected since FO1st launched, just to get, *drumroll*, a prime 10mm reciver plan.
---
I'm done with this stupid event.
---
More useful than +4 to each stat from herd mentality and strange in numbers increasing all your mutations?
---
Thanks for your feedback. We will be nerfing it in the next patch. Grind more.
---
Bethesda team.
---
Interesting. I wonder if the juke box alone is sufficient to keep them spawning.
---
If you need some stuff to sell for caps ill give you some bulked steel i have shit tons. If you can go grab screws to trade id be much obliged (they are all i run out of cause im the group mechanic if you will)
---
Its more of a decorative piece than a utility. Not exactly a tough case to crack come on now.
---
It never ceases to amaze me just how incredibly unrealistic expectations can be on here. Lol
---
In what game is free content updates every 4-6 weeks considered "slow"?
---
Bethesda even on their main titles are usually 2-6 months between DLCs and those are paid DLC and their primary operations team.
---
No clue, but considering I’ve only accumulated 250 in 203 levels I’m clearly using it for something 😂
---
herd mentality gives +3 max.
---
What the hell does that have to do with his statement?
---
haha well i just started a youtube chanel about such wacky builds, i have to see where it goes but i do have some ideas floating around in my head 
---
anyways i wish you luck with your build and would be cool to se a post about it if you decide to go for it 😁
---
Of course the number is false. They made the mistake of posting the actual concrete numbers the first day or two, so they had to adjust the goal to make it look legitimate. This time they just fudge the contribution totals to save face.
---
good idea, but will not happen, even if we won't get 6 months of content. 
---
we already went trough this situation after release, didn't got any relevant content for 6 months straight. (no, fasnacht event was not content, it was a time gated event - sheepsquatch was also not worth called content - it was in beta files already).
---
Yikes. Maybe they’re trying to do the exact thing you’re trying to do, and you’re blocking their meat pile as well?
---
Honestly? I have 0 idea. I just check my charges in my banking info to make sure it went through properly
---
Ricochet would be fun until you shoot yourself in  the face lol
---
The worst part is when the enemies spawn in a wall and there is no possible way to complete the wave
---
TBH, I see more Legit SS gauss weapons ruining events these days than actual Legacies.
---
Both are the rewards.
---
I'm glad I can count on simps like you to do all the donating so I can collect the shit recolor BOS outfits for free
---
I realize I'm on the late show for this thread, but I just got the dark matter jet pack yesterday.  I went to put it on my T-65 and its listed but grayed out, like I don't have the right mats or skills, but I do as far as I can see... i also tried to add to my excavator set thinking it may be a T-65 bug, but same deal. 
---
Any help/guidance appreciated!
---
No, believe what's true.
---
They need to make a level 100+ server where even the forest enemies are like level 58
---
Oh I have like 7 screws cuz I’m building excavator power armor and Chinese stealth armor but I’ll give u them foundation has tons of scrap
---
Shiskebab
---
Yeah patch 21 might be the worst we've had - fast travel bug getting worse, camp building all messed up and constant server last issues. The lag is prob just that twat at Atlas with 150 million steel in his scrap box though...
---
I hear running forward, then backward and holding the exit button while moving backwards is a quick way out of this.
---
The mine for the new encounter will be monongah mine
---
As far as I know, you get your atoms on the exact date you originally purchased your subscription. 
---
I purchased mine in the 18, so I get it every month on the 18.
---
I had the same thing happen to me a couple of times.  Now if the time gets down under 10 minutes I got my Bloodied Gauss to finish her off.
---
Others have told me yes you will keep it.
---
Yep. It only becomes a problem when conflicting play styles clash.
---
I say no to plans myself, first it would basically make all the time and caps I spent collecting the plans, either as the plan itself or by spending time scrapping weapons, on 5 different characters completely wasted.  If they do this, I’d want them to do with future plans, or event plans.  
---
Otherwise I don’t like these as a whole, it takes out a lot of the drive to play other characters, and basically makes other characters pointless.  
---
I mean, you’d basically be able to “twink” every character you make, starting at level 1 you could know every single gold plan and have tons of scrip that you can craft, at level 1, a full set of secret service gear all with the best mods and jet pack.  In previous games I was never keen on over-twinking characters.
---
Just don't do it on other people's workshops and you'll be fine. Don't be a dick and you don't get reported.
---
Cool. Well i meant keep grabbing screws and ill give you like 1k bulk to sell? W/e will get you enough caps is my point. Get extra screws :) (super helpful if they are "tagged for search")
---
The system kinda sucks for gaining caps too... the player killed loses 50 while the attacker gains about 1/4 of that. Unless that player is super persistent and dies at least a few times, you’re spending more to claim the workshop. 
---
I’m cool with pvp, but stuff like that is why most the outspoken pvp players on reddit can be irritating. It’s not that they like fighting each other, but so many consider camping in a corner with stealth on waiting for someone to walk by “pvp.” It’s just clear they’re failed twitch fps’ers that want the thrill of shooting someone without the skill to do it.
---
Yeah man, if you do it for me you will help a fellow raider out, and get these rewards for completing the quest: 2000 caps, treasure hunter outift, Grognak comic, 1 plan of choice form my vendor
---
Oh haha much better. I can imagine the struggle
---
Well, they have the money, it’s just not a worthwhile investment.
---
Ok I’ll be on later I’m ps5
---
Your camp can not be placed on this world....fix that, why doesn't it check before you enter?
---
It is...but some (not as many as in the past) will still try to turn it off so we end up standing around in silence.
---
Uh why are you actually building workshops?
---
The bug sucks during events, but besides events if you ever get this error, just respawn on a teammate.
---
Im going to assume he meant +1 carry per sugar if it maxes at 50
---
Try the wanky furniture vendor at the whitespring
---
I’m on Skyrim atm. If I knew of a good alternative to Fallout, preferably made by a completely different company, I’d give that a go.
---
make sure you fill that scrapbox as much as possible in that month.
---
How so? I would assume Appalachia is more of a country type state.
---
Ah I just found it through my Microsoft account. Mine was renewed on 8/4 and I don't have any atoms from it either 😡
---
Is the fishbowl helmet supposed to be part of it? Or is it just one of those things where it looks like it’s included but it isn’t?
---
1x Scrap item is the same as 1000000x Scrap items. Makes no difference.
---
You mean like how it was before wastelanders?
---
Does your C.A.M.P have a skin on it?  if so remove it. then try again
---
Did you apply the future-tec camp paint?
---
The cap thing would ruin the economy even more. Most items that are priced close to the max caps right now would shoot up, and low level players wouldn’t be able to get anything for how many caps they have. A better solution would be to make NPC vendor items much cheaper, causing it to actually be worth buying from them, meaning d*ped presents would get used up quicker and there would be a faster return to the normal economy. This would also drive down player vendor prices and make caps valuable again
---
Maybe they're slowly learning.
---
Stop laughing!
---
If you dont have the max amount of characters you can just start a new character and play for like 10 minutes to level up
---
Just enjoy the increased functionality in workshops now. There has been 0 incentive to take useless workshops like Tyler County until this trick became popular.
---
Enjoy defending it against players who want the ammo.
---
Neat! Safe travels friend! Ill be sure to make journal logs of the foil card waslander when i start up 😃
---
I know, that was a joke taking the piss out of the only content we got in that patch
---
So with watoga you mean phoenix right?
---
At least I know it's not just me. If i figure it out I'll make sure to let you know how I did it. Good luck to us both
---
I agree with you. I just don't think that it makes OP entitled. They weren't demanding that these be added to the game, they were just sharing an idea. We all want different things, hopefully we will all get a little something for how we like to play. I don't think that there is a chance in hell for this functionality, but then again it's really no different than a fridge, display case or punch bowl in regards to how it works under the hood.
---
nice ill keep an eye out for it 😁
---
That's amazing!
---
unfortunately when you display it in a display case, or even the Thanksgiving one it puts it face down on the floor of it :(
---
I just ended up using a regular teddy bear and a pristine one to get to 12 total to fill up 3 display cases (or 2 Thanksgiving ones)
---
The Shishkebab is a katana. Not to mention I don't know how a traditionally Japanese sword would go over as a skin for the Chinese Officer Sword.
---
I found this info but not sure what that means for console users:
---
Atoms will be delivered monthly, with the first installment delivered at the time of purchase. Note that Atoms are placed in a wallet on the platform they were purchased from originally. E.g. Atoms received from a Fallout 1st Membership purchased on Bethesda.net will be usable in Fallout 76 when played on the Bethesda.net Launcher
---
tinkers workbench has more value, don’t think your throwing in enough
---
I loved my two shot .44 pistol in Fallout 4 and I hoped for it to be just as good in Fallout 76 but sadly it wasn't.
---
Personally, i'm skeptical that concrete was actually met and not "fixed"
---
Yes please! Oh and is anyone else annoyed by the current radio hostess?
---
What's not super fun? The fact that you don't get them or they're one shotting everything?
---
If it's the one shifting everything, I can't help you there. All I can suggest is farming different events instead, or get a group of people who care. A private world would be a bonus.
---
As for not having access to them? As many others have stated, legacy weapons are not nearly as crazy good as they used to be, and my lvl 45 One star Bloody deathclaw gauntlet with claw mod still does respectable damage by comparison. 
---
Hacked weapons are dumb though. Hate that shit.
---
Sell concrete, bone, leather, and cloth to vendor bots.
---
Nobody will buy them.
---
Don't have time? Drop them
---
Don't give up your day job. ;)
---
It's the same thing as under armor. They dont have a lev you can wear at at level 1 and can be found all over the place for free. They have mods and I have given out many shielded under armor to lev 1s. I think PA chassis should have the same mods.
---
And this is from a guy that never uses PA
---
There's a limit to how many you can rename though
---
So you can say, with close to complete certainty that you have never traded for an item that was duped? The chances of that are slim to none. So you hope they get castrated by dull sheep shears, but you're more than happy to utilize what they provide.
---
I've never killed the SBQ with a magic gun that fast and a majority of the time I'm always being out damaged by bloody builds. I would bet either a hacked weapon or unarmed bloody.
---
This pinata effect would be new to me, I've looted confetti exploded bodies many times.
---
Bye. Can I have your stuff?
---
lol! you had me at vodka. where do i sign up?
---
That wouldn't surprise me. The amount they're showing doesn't square with the posts I'm seeing about how rare it is.
---
Agreed, blocker is pointless.  I have Traveling Pharmacy instead and carry around a couple hundred stimpaks, radaway and other performance enhancing drugs.  Can still face-tank the queen and take a few swipes with no worries.
---
Now poison damage.... Legendary Perks can't come soon enough.  Gotta plug that leak.
---
Question is, when this event is over, will we start Season 2 of the Legendary Run immediately, or, if not, will they switch dailies and weeklies back to Atoms until that time?
---
Update view surges are normal for every game. Increased player count after DLC is normal for every game.
---
I would look at what is being said at the shareholder meetings if you want an honest view on what is happening with the game.
---
Til Meg is a Trans woman
---
Ahhh I won’t be on for a while, maybe not at all today. If you don’t get any from the other guy by tomorrow let me know though, I’ll add ya
---
Really? Just last week I made my friend a fusion reactor for his CAMP. We figured it might disappear when I left or he left but a week later we log in and it’s still there.
---
You drive a hard bargain! It’s a deal
---
South of new gad!
---
what a coal-ity pun
---
not with strange in numbers active
---
my specials before joining a team are 
---
14 9 10 -1 10 13 7
---
and after
---
18 14 14 5 17 18 11 
---
it will round up or round down points if it's like 1/2 or 1/4 of a point.
---
It's more a tactic to drain dupers of their resources.
---
All I seem to get are piles of grenades that I won't use.
---
I submitted a ticket asking them how to get the atoms lol we'll see what they say
---
They have the capacity to make them vend, but I doubt Beth will implement that functionality
---
Oh and I don’t actually work for the town I just heard a rumour that they were building.
---
For the 15mil? There’s somewhere upwards of 100k users, that would mean only like half the playerbase or fewer would have had to make 1 donation.
---
It's not true though.
---
People preach about being Mr nice. Yet they one shot things at events too.
---
I might be wrong here but aren't katana two handed weapons?
---
You keep the outfit. You lose the sex tent. You lose the ability to put scrap in your Scrapbox but keep the ability to pull scrap out.
---
Yup.
---
Sure, but I could do the same with a missile launcher with far more common ammo, a vastly larger explosion radius, and auto-tracking if I want it.
---
I've has this happen to me twice at SBQ events. I had to leave the server twice.
---
Yes, absolutely 👍
---
Shoot you’re absolutely right. I’ll take that one on the chin.
---
Great reference and analogy. 
---
You win. JP makes my little boy heart happy.
---
that will probably be back in the atom shop soon.
---
Totally agree with you on this. Hell I can 1 shot any trash mob with a hunting rifle..legendary or not.legacies are not the problem here
---
I had 1400; donated 500.
---
I’d love for my shotgun to actually do it’s intended dmg, a slug would be cool
---
Cork isn't as hard to farm. You can get it from scrapping pipe weapons. It's not like concrete, which was 100 percent dependent on the concrete spawning in the right places on the map- and also you had to loot it before someone else did.
---
Ohhh thanks and umm you can have sex?
---
It was the first time I've ever seen anything like this so was curious to see if it's an isolated instance. I have seen piles of stuff before on the ground especially at like line in the sand. 
---
This was something different as I could see numerous item models flying up in the air and scattering in different directions. I of course ran up to check the legendary for a nice item and it was completely empty.
---
Pssst. We already have those
---
Yooo I'm already texting with a support member. This is crazy. This is good customer service so far!
---
Yes you do
---
Alright ill be on after 5. (Bout 5 hours)
---
Not you specifically, but in general, yes.
---
No. It's just a nickname for the 1st tent. Stop eyeballing Rose.
---
Very much so. And it can work in or outside of Power Armor as well.
---
💀💀💀
---
Not for me (PS4) I’ve always accessed it from the zip end of the top
---
There-in lies the problem.
---
I had actually tried to get enough concrete to do at least one donation. But everywhere was cleaned out. This was pretty much for the whole duration of the concrete event. I only managed to scrounge up like 190 concrete, not enough for a turn in.
---
You got my hopes up
---
I did it guys. 
---
I peed sitting down. It was such a liberating moment. I'll look back fondly at many long pees standing up, but won't miss the uncomfortable ones. 
---
So long fellow urinators. 
---
Signing off one last time.
---
-Mr. No one cares.
---
You can roll one from the ally 'retrieve weapon' quests
---
Put your levels into strength and get the strongback perk. There are also perks that reduce the carryweight of junk and medicines. You can also take a backpack with you. And the best tip I can give. Half the stuff you have in your inventory are stuff you know you never gonna use.
---
I have never heard it referred to by that term. 
---
You learn something new every day, I guess.
---
You going to report the Fo1 Exploiters who get all the Line in the Sand waves to spawn in the center and steal xp from everyone else using their gatlingexplosing plasmas?
---
Ohhh :(
---
I don't know who's downvoting all the polite comments but manners cost nothing you filthy neckbeards!
---
I think it's one of the smaller ones in the set, from memory they usually come in a set of 3, the katana, the smaller one is like a wakakashi and the tiny one is a tanto.
---
Game is running just fine for me right now. I'm jumping around the map, killing mobs, scraping and selling items without any problem.
---
Loving all this detailed anecdotal evidence.
---
you have to start somewhere
---
Submit a ticket and check to see if your payment method has been charged or not.
---
They don’t have shareholders. Zenimax is privately owned and Bethesda is a subsidiary.
---
Like I said, you can look at steam analytics, ESO, F4, and Skyrim; none of them had surges anywhere near 4x their playerbase. ESO hit double once. It’s clear what works for them, even if it makes for a worse game.
---
I does look like a katana if you remove the flame thrower parts that is.
---
But I was hoping for a skeaky clean katana, and i really don't know if Bethesad is ever going add that as a real new weapon. Heres hoping that we might get it as a skin for the Chinese Officer sword.
---
Also to answer your question how a katana skin would fit the COS. Why not? It would be just a skin, it would not change any stats or anyother atributes. Do you think that the skin would fit the Revolutionary sword or the Assaultron blade better? I'm honestly fine with any of those weapons...
---
How about 6 months of nothing?
---
I am so glad to hear this, I’ve been a fan since the release of fallout 1 and will gladly maintain a subscription if I get new quest lines. Repaying daily’s just drives me bonkers.
---
You're a troll in every thread you post on, who hurt you?
---
This is a totally legit question and concern, but I couldn't help but giggle simply because the answer is so obvious (once you've gotten that far). It wasn't a judgy giggle, though, because I know I worried about the same issue before I got to that point in the story. :)
---
Like I said, I've submitted multiple. It went through the begining of the month
---
You might be right.
---
But don't you agree that the Katana skin would fit the Pool cue pretty well?
---
They both share STR as the skill tree, so easily swappable perk cards.
---
Platform?
---
If you are on PC, and are using perk loadout manager/text chat mod, be sure to update SFE. I had similar crashes before I updated the .dll also.
---
True, but you can craft 100 cannonballs with just a bit of lead instead of a bunch of resources that are commonly used for weapon repairs. Though I would agree, the Broadsider is whack right now, more just fun to switch up rotations.
---
Back in the first few months I had a level 500+ naked guy show up to my camp armed with combat knife and watched him demolish my walls and structures with a few stabs each. Pretty sure they've made this not possible now or something, but I know the frustration. Some people just need to mess with others, though I do tend to see low levels luring hight level enemies to my friend's camp outside Watoga as a kind of exp farm. So maybe the level 22 wanted you to help?
---
It's about a hundred feet east of the white spring train station
---
There's something oddly satisfying running into a mess of enemies, all being fired at from a distance, wearing no PA, and just hacking things to bits.
---
I had 3+K I donated 2K and haven farming some so i can turn in more before Cork ends.
---
Oh I totes agree. I haven't even considered moving since I plopped down there. Having all the vendors factions at your fingertips is like the icing on the cake too lol
---
That’s what one wasteland is doing I think?
---
I try to do this but on Xbox I can never get the sound levels right. Either Spotify is too loud or the game is.
---
Whoa, now that's a very helpful PSA! I would have never thought of that! Thank you!
---
Don't use the power armor unarmed mods either, they're all dogshit
---
Members of this sub do not automatically equate to actual players. A lot of folk would’ve joined to find out more info before FO76 was released, but never bought the game. A lot may still be subscribed but not play the game anymore. Etc.
---
I'm in. But I want some sweet NCR outfits. 
---
And plans that I already have 63 copies of. That's probably the most important.
---
Well that's a good point, I'm always down to changing my build.
---
It may be connection related, but none of the other online games I play...on the same system, same connection, don’t have the same issues.
---
My every day weapon is a 3\* TSE gatling gun which I rolled just after they nerfed it, it still tops out at 434 damage; I thought it did a lot of damage until I rolled a Bloodied Gauss Shotgun which I have had over 2000 damage.  I only use it when I am out there alone or against the SBQ.
---
And if you try and join with a &lt;100 character, you get a bouncer doing the "Sorry" emote.
---
So I removed the skin but still appears as the Future-Tec skin anyway? I made sure it was unchecked in the Atom Shop.
---
Ok he said I already got them 😬 I didn't even notice the jump in balance but next month I will be paying attention to make sure I get them lol
---
FYI You can only get one of the trophies for completing the vault raid per toon. To get the other you will need to have an alt and work you way through the quest line again.
---
So excited for those.  When I know I'm going to face poisonous enemies, like redditors for example, I just go full health.  I actually run Traveling pharmacy, pack rat, batteries included and thru hiker.  I just checked and my perks are saving me more than 600 lbs rn.
---
Keep tilting at windmills, Don "ITG" Quixote
---
"I'm only 23, BUT..."
---
I typically listen to my own music while gaming but sometimes I enjoy listening to the various fallout 76 playlists which other people have made. Search this sub for some good ones...
---
Did you reset your junk collection past the 180 mark before collecting? 
---
To me, if everywhere was cleaned out that means there were a lot of ppl trying to do it. Even if the concrete supply was small. Especially the building community that normally stocks up on bldg resources and wants camp cosmetics like the flag.
---
Did you change the camp back to the normal skin, like and replaced it? If not you prolly gotta replace it after its the normal skin, leave, and come back
---
Ha ur so funny bro lmao i know u full of crap
---
Oh but wait. Bethesda is gonna give you the reward whether I donate for you or not right? I couldn't care less about the BoS ... and honestly I donate what I can to help out the rest of the community. 
---
What I don't do is cry about it.
---
Isn't the pinata effect something from the lunchbox reward?
---
No:
---
- Pocketed
---
- Deep Pocketed
---
- Lighter Build
---
- Ultra-light
---
- Strengthened
---
- Lead Lined
---
Something tells me things would get super ugly, super fast, if this was ever implemented. Never underestimate the lengths an a-hole will go to do be an a-hole. I could see maybe a few categories of pre-made form letter type notes, but Lord help us all if they did see fit to add this to the game and make it freely customizable!
---
Yeah, the shishkebab is awesome though. It'd  be nice if we got a European style two handed sword too. Like a Zweihander / great sword
---
&gt; I'd expect their databases to be able to handle this kind of stuff specially when they are using AWS
---
You keep mentioning "AWS" like it's some kind of magic bullet, do you work for Amazon or something?
---
AWS runs the server back end, has nothing to do with the ***client***, which in some cases is a 10 year old potato PC, or a 4G mobile hotspot for bandwidth. Nothing AWS can do about those problems, my friend. You must understand that many decisions in modern software design are all compromises. It's like auto racing; There's **performance**, **reliability** and **cost**. Pick two and throw the third out the window.
---
As to your points, there used to be a visual representation of the item for purchase, just like in your inventory. Several months ago, that feature broke and you cannot see item previews any longer. I would imagine the developers are aware of this and will fix it eventually.
---
I don't think we need the "whole set" PA tweak you speak of, just for sales reasons? Not sure how big the used PA market is. I prefer to make it myself, kind of a rite of passage in a Fallout game.
---
I'm confused. I thought that this could only be done in private teams, but you say it was a public team. Can anyone confirm which is it?
---
Anyone who has traded with another player or bought anything from player vendor can not say with any certainty that he/she has not traded for duped item.
---
I do not use much vendors nowdays, but I do try to be careful and not buy if vendors have iffy items.
---
But I do believe they are selfish morons and hope they get castrated by dull sheep shears. They and their supporters only hurt games and actual real gamers.
---
Really? I'm not at all familiar with that game, but I have to ask how it went. Did it turn into a hate-fest, or did people get weird and creative and goofy?
---
Your not wrong, tbh I do the same if The other people in the events don’t pay attention to me telling them where the legendary is
---
Several people have reported completing it by server hopping
---
Some of them even got banned for telling them how to sort the game and showing how exploits was done ONLY to Bethesda, even more hilariously each got slightly different responses.. was an utter cluster fuck.
---
To throw some icing on this turdcake shortly later ErectBan turned up and the infamous inventory hack and the other various scriptkiddy apps he has created.  Not sure if he/she is one of the community modders disgruntled by Bethesda or not, just the timing was interesting.
---
Past couple of days, I've seen posts about things spawning dead, could be related to that.
---
But I've personally never seen her die instantly, even with magic weapons, at least 10 secs.
---
No because BGS doesn't know what human interaction looks like
---
&gt;We should give them more money!
---
The game runs fine for me until I decide to use my favorite weapon then it's a pixelated laggy mess. No teslas for now ☹️☹️
---
If it is so important to get the challenge, make a character and use it for that.  Once level 10 delete the toon and make another.  Leveling up is easier at low levels, but this will require you to have at least one open character spot :(
---
Makes you wonder how many more lies there are the patch notes
---
Perfect example; deep pocketed limbs are now available to buy for secret service armour
---
Normal behavior, enjoy free stuff for minimal effort.
---
Place glitched ammo extractor down at all workshops. Otherwise, there is no point in wasting your time with them
---
Me too, I calculated that I'll rank up to level 100 on its last day (doing all the challenges +5 repeatable challanges every day), if we manage to get to 200mln finally I can rest a bit
---
This made me giggle. Pet peeve for me also.
---
Correcting people's mistakes is trolling? Or do you not know what trolling means, kid?
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
About to log on I'll send a request
---
Here's the build I'm using for [PA, Bloody Heavy Energy Weapons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f343f88&amp;d=sq2s32sr2ic2ip2ir2l71lt2ei2eu0s22pe2cu2id2s12s72sb2a12a71lu2&amp;w=ls2a04sg2cr0at1lm2ag2i71if2im1ik0iq2ie2in1ih2ij2ii0i61p10sa2s01e00pa0p80p90i30ia0i50la2ib4eh2c70c52c10ce0&amp;m=c2fe3&amp;wp=w7&amp;wm=142535&amp;n=Bloodied%20Heavy%20Energy).  Works for ballistic weapons as well, I actually carry around an AA25 Gatling for trash mobs, Bloody .50cal for quick WesTek runs and a couple Guass Minis for SBQ fights (swapping out Gunsmith 3 for Demo Expert 3) .  Bear Arms lets you carry around more weapons than is sane, and weight reducing perks for chems, food/drink means you never have to head back to CAMP to resupply.  Even loaded to the gills with guns, food and ammo I still have around a hundred pounds of free storage space in PA and even more outside, thanks to Radicool and Unyeilding armor.  Get yourself a full set of Unyeilding, any level, doesn't matter, and mod it for ultralightweight; you live inside of PA.  I carry around a hundred or so fusion cores for my B25 UGL and PA (Emergency Protocols, Calibrated Shocks and Targeting HUD are a must), and a hundred or so Plasma cores for a Vampires Gatling Plasma.  I keep meaning to swap in a Bloody Cryolater at some point to help with SBQ battles, always appreciate it when someone freezes her on the ground.
---
sadly s.o.l. been there twice. make new memories.
---
To my understanding you have to re place it which means moving your camp.
---
Thank you for this death by the phrase "a dry bucket of snot!" It is both descriptive and grossly hilarious, and I salute you. I may have to use that next time someone pisses me off!
---
I know we have three.  You have to have the workbench and be in the are.  Meaning if you want it to show up in the savage divide you need it have the thunder mountain workshop.  I would like where no matter what they show up.  If I'm in swamp I throw it and boom it comes in and starts taking things out for x amount of damage.  Meaning I don't need a workshop or be in a particular area.
---
What instigating weapon Is soo good that it can 1 hit sbq without mutations like ar and carnivore for the for food buffs??
---
If I had to guess, that's just not how companies like Bethesda are organized at this stage of a game's lifecycle, capable of big pushed toward higher quality of life, or technical fixes.. The big QA/technical teams are probably mostly disbanded, and the teams that remain are like little monetization raviolis. A project manager or two, some devs and designers, but most importantly, always a bunch of "product" minded VPs who are pretty much there for monetization purposes. But maybe I'm being cynical.
---
I’ve even had them spawn inside the building as in the space occupied by the building in the overworld. I had to use floater grenades to get them
---
That's where I got my golf club. Feral ghoul horde was near Flatwoods.
---
Shitposting gone wrong
---
Nah I think u/Nominative99 is right it wouldn't be that good to point out "Hey look our player base have completed only one ATLAS challenge, all the other ones failed miserably" or "They completed all the challanges but we had to reduce the amount of junk needed to do so"
---
being Canadian myself i feel this. I don't have Fallout 1st but have really been itching to try it for a month.
---
Don't submit multiple tickets it likely pushes them down the wait list.
---
Submit 1 ticket wait for a reply and then reply to their response and repeat until you get an answer.
---
Yeah I'm on now! Only a level 35, if that makes any difference? Peeps on here are usually 300+ haha! My gamertag is halfpint2992!
---
Mirelurk kings/queens are the only thing that stress me out in SBQ fights.  Too often a Mirelurk Queen will spawn after SBQ is down and that poison DOT just shreds.  Lost a fair amount of Flux because I wasn't paying enough attention to the adds at the end.
---
It's often because they will find something to break.
---
If you scrap everything you can, like doors and chairs, it'll help.
---
You'll still need to walk around to aggro them, depending on location.
---
When people say script it really grinds my gears. This isn't a MUD.
---
Alright, thank you
---
No. Go away weeb
---
You have a very condescending attitude, you don't need to be so negative about it champ. We get it, you know everything and you're never wrong. American?
---
Ok, why?
---
Joining you!
---
Duh. After I posted that I thought, "I should edit that." But I'm too lazy and don't mind looking dumb online.
---
shady sands wasn't even a thing yet. Got to know your lore.
---
I mean, I can accept this answer a lot easier than "dupers did it" 
---
I'm gonna go find posts from when it was steel, if this one day figure is higher than the one day total for steel; I don't think any actual explanation holds water. (And I say this as someone who rarely if ever criticizes Bethesda publicly) but this one is just more amusing to me than anything. 
---
I can farm tanagra or glassed caverns for an hour and easily have 30k steel - in an hour. I'll finish this comment when i go look that up.. Lol
---
That's usually the cause of "I didn't get my atoms" more then not from posts I've seen here.
---
Sorry, PC and I am running the Steam version.
---
I managed to get the quest finished, I got lucky and had to dart a fox, brahmin and hound, all of which I knew where to find.
---
It's still crashing in dialogue boxes. I went back to the same vendor to test it. I am not using any mods at all. The game was only installed a few days ago as well.
---
I highly doubt it's on my end, I haven't hadn't had any issues with weapons workbenches until that infernal quest.
---
Only 5 minutes? What happened? Another settlement suddenly needed your help?
---
The radio songs are the most expensive part of the game. They will not add more because they will lose money on "free content".
---
Do the BOS quests, Main Raider Quests, and Miner Miracles for a free set of Ultra,Raider, and the plans for Excavator. Also you can server hop outside mama dolce’s to get power armor bits
---
Ok np.  Thanks again
---
Or you haven't bothered picking up pipe weapons and golfballs for scrapping. :P
---
Yes, since they are both in STR, but if you want to balance them at the same time, it's going to be a crowded stat.
---
Consider taking one rank of each Heavy Gunner perk rather than maxing them out, because +30% damage for 3 SPECIAL is more efficient than +60% damage for 9 SPECIAL.  And if you aren't using Power Armor, opt for Unarmed because it only has the one Iron Fist perk which only gets 3 SPECIAL to max out.
---
That would be a good idea.  PA really needs a boost
---
Ugh beat me to it!
---
So you have absolutely no financial data on this game because it is privately owned but you say this game depends on updates to stay afloat?
---
Or do you have some financial data that shows this game is only surviving on updates? or however you want to say that
---
That can get annoying but not as much as the level 500+ with the legacy deathbringer who sits on one of the spawn points and takes everything out so my little old level 25 melee build is running around like a Karen at a Walmart sale
---
It's likely "magic weapon" shit.
---
Did you do any of the original quest? You get two full sets through that and plans for a 3rd. Also read the sign outside the rusty pick to start quest for a 3rd.
---
No coms but thanks so much!
---
I'm sorry, you set me up for that. 😘
---
Completely wrong.
---
Motherload gives you access to Hornwright estate.
---
You can find the Garrahan estate key on the ceos desk in Garrahan Mining corp.
---
its actually kinda mind boggling how much Bethesda makes from Fallout 1st.
---
according to a google search there are approx. 400k Fallout 76 players (its from last year so i dunno if there is any new info on it could not find anything), so to give the benefit of the doubt lets say 200k (so half) are 1st subscribers. they obviously use USD to calculate so at $13 per subscriber per month equals out to 2.6 million per month. or if you chose the $100 a year subscription that means Beth is getting 20 million per year from it... to be honest at $20 million a year you would think you would get more out of it, but seeings at Bethesda is a business they are in it for the money all thanks to the parent company ZeniMax
---
This, stack size makes no difference. But different items do. I have almost 1 of every cosmetic item in my stash and it often lags bad especially on that tab.
---
Secondary characters with little in their stash never have a stash box lag.
---
Same thing can happen in pipboy when people keep every note and holo they ever encountered
---
Not everyone syncs to the SBQ at the same time.  I know that for me, there's always a good 3-5 seconds where other people are shooting in her general direction, but I don't even see her, then she fazes into existence.  It's entirely possible for someone with a magic exploit weapon to be there at the start, camping the Fissure Site.
---
My pleasure! Have fun!
---
Lol. I heard Captain Noob saying that in some videos. Re-equipping guns or perks. Also, we had the photo conversation. "Do you really need 4 pictures from Fasnacht?" I replied, "I deleted the other 6 for you!" 😁
---
I know i should shut my mouth more often
---
Kk
---
Sure. Sounds right up my alley.
---
Are you kidding? The entire forum is PVE only hard hat kids who freak out if someone joins their private world
---
doesn’t take looking at the games financial data to know that quadruple your playerbase is a good thing, especially when any other game you developed hasn’t turned around with half those numbers.
---
It’s an MO. There’s a reason many of them have F2P versions. Keeping a large playerbase is the only way to maintain cash flow.
---
They acknowledged its a bug and will be fixed.
---
When we get that fix is anyones guess.
---
And u get atoms within the season pass through out it, while giving u cosmetic camp items and armour.
---
You just don’t get it do you bud?
---
Right there with ya mate! Bought the GOTY on sale last week (having never played any of the FO4 dlc), and the change of pace is exactly what the doctor ordered. I still log on to FO76 every night to complete my challenges, but as soon as thats done I run back to the Commonwealth to - dare I say it - have some actual fun!
---
I had to climb a mountain about 2 minutes away from red rocket the other day. At least it was a 3 star legendary gutsy. It had the high ground on my though and killed me about 8 friggin times. Got a 1 star rolling pin so hella worth it. 5 stars.
---
Rumors say... Bethesda is trying to make us a little happier after the Update 21 screw up. So, this "shadow event" is doomed to succeed no matter how many people claim they are not delivering anything and call the event a waste of time.
---
 I believe Bethesda is not even counting the delivered resources at this point, they are adding random numbers a few times per day on their website and that's it. They will reward us with all the community rewards regardless of our performance though. At least it looks that way.
---
You mean bring back the fez
---
Yeah I'm good. In 20 minutes I can get enough ***FREE*** lead and acid to make 8-10k rounds.
---
^(but thanks)
---
ive been saying this since launch, there should be a defense timer, not a waves system. if a mongrel got stuck on a tree 300 yards a way and then fucked off in another direction, why do i need to defend my workshop from it?
---
also each wave has subwaves, which is EXTREMELY annoying. it says wave 2/4 but i kill every enemy and have to wait for the rest of the wave to spawn and HOPEFULLY actually attack my workshop
---
When was the last time you played?
---
I had this same idea the other day. I’ve yet to try it out.
---
You know the saying: ‘Great minds think alike’?
---
Sometimes I get lucky...
---
1) Post about PVP
---
2) antiPVP players swarm calling you a griefer for 6 pages 
---
3) you take the bait 
---
4) every one of them slams the report button to get you banned
---
5) they pat themselves on the back for saving PVE
---
Are these bugs on pc?
---
I play on xbox 1 and i do not have these kind of bugs.
---
Occasionally i get an invisible wall or an enemy frozen in place but the things i read here i have never experienced.that's why im asking.
---
I don't get it why you've to be so passive-aggressive about it but anyway.  I wasn't talking specifically about FPS when mentioning AWS but more about the  association of "technical limitation" to the actual stash and camp limitations made by many players  in this post.
---
Actually I work with software development and I've worked for Amazon for 2 years before leaving for a better opportunity, that said, I expected more from Fallout 76 having limitations regarding number of items in stashes and size of C.A.M.P.s because there are many other games that do this flawlessly using their own infra, while AWS has a full-fledged 5 star technical solutions, which are all extremely fast and scalable , that's why I don't see why this would be an issue, there are many SQL and NoSQL solutions that'd be great for dealing with a huge amount of player data while maintaining a fast IO speed.
---
Now that I think of it I don't that the stash size limit is because of technical (backend) limitations, not only because of what I just said but also because fallout 1st players get a infinite Scrap Stash.
---
I don't think they are making a compromise with performance or potato-pc friendly by limiting those, I believe that related to CAMP limitation specifically may be due to a lack of optimization or client-side limitations due to legacy code taken from Fallout 4 in the best  but that's just me.
---
Anyways, chill down man, it's ok to disagree.
---
You won’t be able to have all 9 perk levels for both as Str only goes up to 15
---
You want anything in return?
---
Just let it get taken..lol..easier to reclaim from creatures than defend..
---
Guy thought it was clever but ended up being just silly.
---
Nope! Happy to help out!
---
About 1 year ago from today
---
Well spotted. Americans are only exceptional in arrogance.
---
Souce: american working on being more aware of my own flaws.
---
There's no negativity whatsoever. If anything, I'm trying to help. Who is we? It's just you and I here. American? What makes you ask that?
---
the "rumors" are saying this is what Bethesda is doing to make up for Patch 21?
---
Its basically a classic combination in this game, you just swap out swap out the perk cards depending on what you're doing. Or you have one level of each and run heavies and melee at the same time.
---
This is problematic for Swarm of Suitors as well as Breach and Clear events.  The mirelurks stick around the top of the hills and never come down.  You have to go up and blast them.
---
In B&amp;C, some of the Mole Miners that you need to clear out before the event starts stay buried under the ground.  If you're lucky, a yellow point will show where they are and you can force them out by attacking the spot.  If not, well you're SOL!
---
I saw someone yesterday with a “perfectly preserved pie” listed for $3,000.  Everything else was priced appropriately so I knew it was a joke.
---
Or....it wasn’t a joke and the pie is actually priced appropriately since I sincerely considered buying it.
---
What kind of build is your character?
---
Proof lies in the down votes.  People who downvote are usually guilty of hypocritical behaviour on this subject. While you live in an ignorant bubble pretending one shot douche nodes don't exist, the truth is they do exist. They're everywhere
---
You even have the ones who live in denial and whinge about it. Then those who are cocky
---
I only do it to those who don't help events or have done so themselves
---
It's karma. Not problematic as you seem to deem it.
---
But having played since launch, the amount of times I've been in events where people take legendaries, even from low level players, e.g fasnacht event.
---
So deny all you want.
---
Everyone's one shotted a legendary once or twice.
---
I am a fallout 1st subscriber who never buys anything really from the atom shop, some repair kits now and then.  I had 5K in atoms, got about 4 levels through the last tear and just bought my way out.  I am happy because I am back playing the way I like to play, no regrets.
---
It was a Theremin, the hand wavey music thingy.  You might have to wait for it to come back to the Atom Store.
---
hence why they said, "up to 50..." but i do see your point.
---
Go here [https://fo76map.com/](https://fo76map.com/)  and click "Hide All" and then click power armor to see all the spawn locations for free PA pieces. That being said, it's fairly easy to level up to 50 so I would get there before putting together a full set.
---
Edit: I slightly take it back. Excavator is awesome for levels 35-50 until you can put together a full set of T60 or Ultracite.
---
what are you looking to do?
---
not sure if I understand correctly but, there are instruments you can unlock with plans. Then you can build them in your camp, they're under the Chairs tab. I forget where the pianos are
---
Nobody, that one is compete, now you give cork.
---
Sorry your SCORE keeps getting completed. Yes, it is still a thing, several people posted about it yesterday.
---
I bought 500 bulked cork from a guy last week and I donated it yesterday along with 1000 that I gathered myself.
---
Of the events I've been to, I'd say 1 in 5 times someone would alert where the spawn is.
---
Others just run buckwild shooting and taking it all.
---
Jack O Lantern skin too!
---
Yeah imo seasons would be received way better if it came with endgame content to do alongside the season. If we could do expeditions/colossal problem, the grind would feel more like a thing on the side.
---
We did try it didnt work
---
If any game has a pay to get cosmetic store then it can maintain cash flow without needing to release any serious update content.
---
The sales from FO 1st and the Atom store would be pretty massive every month if I had to guess.. without looking at numbers..
---
Oh shoot. Is the cork on now or no?
---
I know. Like I said, a right good kicking.
---
Aim higher to give em more motivation
---
This happens in one of the junkyards too.  The ferals spawn inside a locked truck trailer with a level 2 or 3 lock.  If you don't have the perk to pick the lock and open it, you're screwed.
---
If you're at the Atlas Observatory, wouldn't it tell you that?
---
I built an INT focused Junkie character for that (regularly he's at around 20-30 INT). Didn't start slowing down a lot until level 120. Made a sniper bloodied build today to start doing the level up daily with.
---
I don’t think you do. The amount of posts I have here whining about the building aspect. We want this and that. It’s not important to have 6 different scrap boxes to access 6 different tabs. Go and play Minecraft with a fall out skin. That’s what u want
---
1- know someone who has fallout 1st
---
2- wait till line in the sand shows up
---
3- have them place their tent in the special area
---
4- lag glitch the jetpack to get on the roof 
---
5- use any type of explosive and shot at the mid when the scorched spawn
---
I lvl up at least once doing this and I'm lvl 269
---
The "enjoy the game again" is totally on point, after the last patch I enjoyed ignoring the dailies then nuking the brotherhood and logging off.
---
Since I just chill out most of the time I don't notice it. But I feel like it would help save time if I just started a new character, though I haven't been able to decide on a build considering my current build can manage not only carrying but using (with some perk switching of course) Heavy guns, shotguns, automatic rifles, single shot rifles, and all melee options. 
---
So it's very likely my next build will be agility pistol focused but if I recall correctly those pare well with vats which are broken as I've been told. I could also go for tank or just roll with the first legend I get as a sign of what I should do. I know I'm going off on a tangent but I figured I may as well ask for some advice while I'm here.
---
Wastelanders came out and added a decent amount of new stuff. The quest line can be finished in two or three days of you want to finish it fast. There are several new weapons and armor sets you can grind gold for after. The wendigo colossus was added as a random chance spawn in several spots if you nuke them. The event hasn't been implemented yet for it. They are behind on a lot of content they had promised which isn't anything new. They added camp allies, two of which have storylines with some unique rewards. If you do the Wastelanders quests I would recommend doing both sides until forced to choose so you can unlock more of the rewards. Public teams have been implemented which is a nice addition for bonus xp or other stats. I'd say there has been a decent amount added but it's a bit of a grind for the new gear as most of it can't be traded.
---
BOS have always been the baddies. If you disagree, you're probably a fascist.
---
I have no idea. Like I said I haven't been on for a while. Is it a quest I turn on?
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hx4vtm/tip_for_finding_a_bobblehead_for_the_daily_today/
---
FYI - there is a search function. I searched "Bobblehead" and that was the second result.
---
Is this a thing? I've rarely been at an event that failed? If all the events you're at are failing, maybe look at why that is happening?
---
I get that it is their job to advertise and to talk incessantly these days. That's why I plug Spotify into my car radio most of the time. No more annoying nonsense, unless I listen to the news or traffic reports. Not all areas have annoying radio, but where I live, it's almost unbearable. I do occasionally have to listen to radio when I have low internet signal.
---
There are radio stations that follow a DJ-free format, like Jack-FM. I'd like the option to have a minimal or non-existent DJ. Like the classical station. Or like Appalachia radio was for a year and a half.
---
There's a guy at Atlas. Talk to him.
---
Damn. I just got it setup the way I wanted it too.
---
Then why couldn’t we get more than 15 million concrete?
---
I combined them and added a BOS hood. The Hood looks great with the plague mask as is they mesh well together.
---
I saw someone selling a modded legendary “alien blaster rifle” today. Instant report for cheating.
---
I had over 1000 cork compared to the 111 concrete.
---
Oh, ok. If it's repeatable and crashes at the same moment all the time it probably was a long shot anyway.
---
I started crashing randomly after patch 21 and in the end it was SFE ... didn't crash since. Last thing, and the only thing that probably Bethesda support will have you do, is check whether you have Game DVR turned off in windows ... That also fixed a few crashes for me back then.
---
All of my friends in game feel the same way unfortunately, they’re mostly off playing different games now.
---
Your puns are alright, but miner gold.
---
Or how she singlehandedly fixed everything so we wouldn't have to listen to Anything Goes on repeat forever?
---
If you're serious about dealing melee damage then be prepared to cook.

Balance and release these again or remove. The fact that people get to keep these is BS.
---
No need to change it. So what I do. There’s no downside to herd mentality. So get that. And if u join a team swap out wanderer for strange in numbers and Insperational for the xp.
---
I've gotten into the habit of ending the day with about 80% of the bar before the next level.  Feels less tedious to hit that level up the next day.
---
Yep. Here’s an example:

---
Right at the moment it's on cork. You need to have at least 250 cork in your inventory and you need to go to one of the black crates on the floor scattered around
---
&gt; I switched to ESO when it went on sale on PS4, and it feels like it’s run by a completely different company. 
---
I mean it technically was made by a different company. Its not even the same engine. Zenimax/Bethesda Softworks also have a decent sized team focused on developing and managing ESO. 76's post launch development was given to the Austin Studio which was the newest and smallest studio at the time. They have some occasional help from the Dallas studio which is the current newest and smallest, but both together are probably still less than half the amount of people working on ESO.
---
i rather listen to that than her talking
---
junk items are totally not worth any mention since they stack. 
---
the game loads itemID's individual, having about 25-30 items as junk in the 1st stash or common chest does literally nothing to the performance. the amount is also nothing that would impact the performance, since it's only numbers. no matter if a single junk item or a stack of 500mil. 
---
what impacts the client stability is when hundreds of different id's have to load simultaneously like having a weapon/armor mule. like, let's say some hardcore dupers offering you a look into their inventory (only then, since containers won't be loaded if not requested by the client).
---
Yep
---
Americans can also be exceptional in ignorance. Source: I am not American. As you have said you are American, I understand why you would automatically think it could only be another American who would be so arrogant.
---
A lot of work still needs to be done on the wiki. Most of the contributors only care about the lore and completely ignore game play elements.
---
I am so tired of hearing people bitching about Fallout 76 being broken with too many bugs. ITS BETHESDA. Have you guys not played any other Bethesda games before? It's kind of what they're known for.
---
I didn't think to report them in-game, that's a pretty good idea.
---
There is helicopter pad looking surfaces that have a crate. There is two crates. The scenery looks different this time around so just search on those pads for a black box.
---
Fin Stabilized?
---
Probably is, which is why most games that run this way are primarily focused on an increased playerbase. There’s a reason they allowed Xbox gamepass to use only this game. They can make just as much money convincing 1 player to buy FO1st than having 2 buy a new copy, and they make nothing off used copy sales. 
---
That’s why it doesn’t matter if we look up the exact earnings, because all we need is a rough idea how many people are actually playing. The % of people buying cosmetics will stay roughly the same, and even if it does. 25% of 400ppl making purchases is not different than 100ppl at 100%. Might as well take the bigger number that offer more publicity.
---
Updates like wastelanders are what increase player count.
---
The only events that seem to fail for me are Campfire Tales (everyone stands around to collect the rewards and doesn't collect kindling for the fire) and Radiation Rumble (because everyone likes to sit and crouch and collect rewards and not shoot or run for ore.)
---
I'm level 175 and have yet to complete an Encryptid event.  No one ever shows up!
---
what events?
---
I just tried another workbench and it crashed about 8 seconds in.
---
All gaming features are disabled in windows. I am pretty strict with the OS and trim the fat and bloat as much as possible.
---
I also have a 5700 XT, the software is known to be problematic so I don't run it, I use MSI Afterburner to manage my card. I don't have these issues with any other game. Something happened today that started it. Unfortunately I was scavenging in a wide range of areas, some new. I haven't had any previous patch version.
---
Thanks for your help anyway, hopefully bethesda can fix this or I have no option but to pursue a refund.
---
Same exact thing happened to me this morning. Logged into adventure after the reset. First time I have had any autocomplete issues. Luckily I'm at 89.
---
It probably won’t amount to anything but I think it’s still a good idea
---
I prefer it that way, solo is a lot easier.
---
Np. I dont get why this guy wouldn't just say
---
I don't remember seeing anything unpleasant. People mostly just wrote goofy messages, quotes, etc.
---
Someone on reddit clued me into Old World Radio Boston on YouTube, I’m currently listening to it at work, if you need a break from the in game tunes but love the genre of music check it out.
---
Presumptive too it seems. I was wrong. 
---
Still not a good sign that an american finds you arrogant. Thanks for helping my ignorance though!
---
Please dont source your country as it will lower my expectations in the future. Also be humble, i hear its sexy.
---
Check out falloutfirst.com
---
Why are you still playing?
---
What the fuck are you even talking about?
---
The NCR arrives at west Virginia after wiping the brotherhood of steel, they tune at the radio signal suddenly rose starts speaking the NCR turns around and leave Appalachia never to return.
---
Why does this post not have more up votes? Here take mine. I miss having a dog companion.
---
Then make a fridge stash box and only use that to take out food. There’s actually one from atom store btw. A car for scrap maybe. Is there a wardrobe scrap box?  I’m not really sure I know there’s lots. A filing cabinet and only take plans and maybe holotapes. It’s all there. Op is asking for seperation of code for each individual stash box. That’s server space taken up to store them. Camp space taken to implement them all. And all so u don’t have to click a button
---
Stop shooting her with your dumbass Gatling Laser while running One Gun Army. She hasn't taken limb damage in 4 months. All you do is prevent her from landing.
---
I noticed a glitch today that might be related.  I had tagged challenges from yesterday; but didn’t finish them (kill scorched, level up and a couple others).  
---
Well, some of the challenges were the same today (kill 10 scorch).  I did that, it shows as complete, yet the tracking stays on and can’t be disabled.
---
Well I want the game to be good but at this point I’ve lost all hope.
---
There is also a stash box near by so you dont have to go to a camp
---
Oh thanks!
---
Minecraft doesn’t have chests organized by material :P  you are just a ray of sunshine too.
---
I don't understand. In what way would stating my nationality lower your expectations? Expectations of what exactly?
---
No problem dude
---
That would be highly appropriate and super cool!
---
More realistic would be a playlist or set of artists...
---
I found a nuka cola in the toilet at Fort Defiance today. I was just looking to see if the red nurse outfit was there, but found a toilet nuka cola instead.
---
The only event I’ve had fail recently was Feed the People, because somebody just sat on the terminal until the timer went to 0 and then got off of it.
---
On top of this you don’t get any of the rewards for completing it. Which means I wasted a good 10 minutes for absolutely nothing.
---
If you dont want to donate to the NCR . The Free states are always here to help with what you need. Just donate 100 steel. Wood. Or whatever you can gather. Located on the dam by the southern bell motel
---
Since they didn't really think trough these quantities, I don't mind if they just fudge the whole thing and leave us with the illusion of accomplishment and ATLAS provisions (:
---
PVP vats has been broken for 4 months. They have not acknowledged this problem and likely never will.
---
My go-to for this is the service area beneath Wavy Willards. There's usually one in the tool room with the fusion generator.
---
Also is there a way to see how much everyone has donated in game?
---
Yeah!  The last few times I've done it solo and it's chock full of XP.  Wondered why no one bothered.  Only problem I found is the mask doesn't leave my head after the event cosmetically.  I switch back to my regular helmet in inventory, but the graphic shows the Halloween mask until you jump servers.
---
perhaps if you read the entire comment chain, you wouldn't have to ask. makes perfect sense. maybe not to a dumb cultist though.
---
Yes it's on their event website but it is manually updated
---
Yeah heard it in a gellet commercial yesterday. Its a free stock music lol
---
Oh no. Ok thanks again
---
We? You're on a public group discussion forum and your name has stood out to me countless times as someone that just needs to get a snippy little comment in to downplay someone else's opinion, or even just to get the last word in if someone has the nerve to take the bait and respond to you. It's a video game, get over yourself.
---
I find your arrogance annoying. Not trying to be contrarian but it seems from your history you thrive in that. Because i find your personality vexxing I would prefer to remain ignorant so i dont wrongly judge the culture that cultivated the arrogance/argumentative nature.
---
You're a bit of an *arse. Take care.
---
Wastelanders was late by 8 months
---
Yo screw you ncr jerkwads I'm gonna set up a lemonade stand to fund the glorious uprising of Ceasars legion
---
Np mate. Have fun
---
And ima do it on the other end of grafton dam!
---
Kinda sucks, I'm not that good with the scopes on my guns, just run them for the increased range in vats, so I'm pretty screwed when in comes to dealing with other players then.
---
There is a small warehouse behind mama dolces that spawns power armour, you could server hop till you get a full set.
---
Cork was such a strange pick for a resource. My original thought was that it was duped to all hell because it’s rarity.
---
Get reflex sights
---
They really do need to implement a better post legendary run system. I finished the legendary run with no atoms spent and have zero reason to log in daily now.  I don’t think we should get atoms considering that defeats the purpose of LR for Bethesda, maybe a small amount of scrip like daily missions gives?
---
I know of 4 spawn locations for power armor in Watoga.
---
1. Roof of Watago High School, there's a BOS corpse next to it.
---
2. Next to a crashed Vertibird, next to AMS
---
3. Roof of a building next to the Civic Center, climb the fire escape on the Civic Center, then cross a walkway to a nearby roof (NOT past the super mutants, other direction), it will be next to a Veribird with no landing gear.
---
4. The roof of Watoga Emergency Services, there's a little nook that has a PA chassis spawn point.
---
&gt;Now that I think of it I don't that the stash size limit is because of technical (backend) limitations, not only because of what I just said but also because fallout 1st players get a infinite Scrap Stash.
---
But scrap is not rendered by the client. To either the host player or any visitors. To them it is just a database entry, which your AWS handles great, and why there are no limits.
---
&gt; I don't think they are making a compromise with performance or potato-pc friendly by limiting those, I believe that related to CAMP limitation specifically may be due to a lack of optimization or client-side limitations due to legacy code taken from Fallout 4 in the best but that's just me. 
---
Here is another post where someone explained it better than I, way less passive aggressive: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hyqsyr/a\_3\_foot\_high\_billboard\_sign\_with\_mothman\_on\_it/fzgvzva?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hyqsyr/a_3_foot_high_billboard_sign_with_mothman_on_it/fzgvzva?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
It's considered slow by their very own standards. We used to get updates every 2-3 weeks, with hotfixes for the major issues they introduced. We had one short content drought in the middle of wild appalachia, but it didn't get to the point it's at now until when wastelanders was originally supposed to launch. Then people used wastelanders as an excuse for why we weren't getting any updates. Yet after wastelanders finally came out, they went right back to that slow schedule of one update every month and a half or so. And we aren't getting emergency updates for MASSIVE in-game issues anymore. Adrenaline not working? Meat piles causing unplayable frame drops? Atom shop items people paid money for not working? Too bad, gotta wait another month for the fix.
---
Also lmao, "free content updates every 4-6 weeks". We get *patches* a bit less often than once a month. Restocking their microtransaction store doesn't count as content. We have only had two content updates this year, wastelanders and seasons. That's an average of 4 months per content update. If we could get something like that every 4-6 weeks, then yeah I wouldn't be complaining, but I would hope that they shift their focus to fixing things rather than pumping out barely functioning content.
---
One is much less annoying than 4. I have one set up for lowbie goodies, and three normal ones for actual sales. Works out fairly well.
---
So do section by section. Go over bits and pieces at a time to ensure the code is correct and that copying and pasting one piece of code into another part of the game actually works as it should and variants are changed accordingly.
---
I feel like they copy and paste so much of their code into different aspects of the game and are too complacent with the fact that it "fits," that they don't make proper adjustments to make it actually work.. and when they do realize it won't work, that they change the initial bit of code that then affects a dozen other parts of the game (that share the same bits of code) negatively. If a=b here, then obviously we can copy a=b there too. And there, and there as well, what could possibly go wrong?
---
I've done little bits of coding, but I'm self taught and don't know terminology, and I am aware there is way more to it than I've stated, but to me it feels like laziness. Idk.
---
I like mothman.  But I'm ashamed now to be associated because of that ignoramus
---
Sorry but it looks like a fail.
---
I had them for a bit, but for whatever reason I had to be right next to a enemie to get over a 50% chance. Running semi automatic I'd prefer to have a higher hit chance. But that being said iv hit a 0% chance before and missed alot of 95%
---
I just feel bad that literally anything you say here gets downvoted. looks like fo76 redditors are big baby bitches.
---
IMO they should make defense events a hot zone where there is no \[hidden\] stealth condition so that enemies seek you. It would make workshop defense events a lot more interesting and not so boringly easy.
---
Treetops
---
Curious about this too.  I've been running the silos solo since around level 60 or so and honesty never lose any health.  Wear the Chinese Stealth armour and stay hidden with a silenced rifle and you can snipe everything in 1 or 2 shots (rifle perks, covert ops, etc. of course help a lot).  I maybe use 100 rounds of .45 with a silenced lever action.
---
Friend someone to play with and pretty much get to a higher level
---
Hmm I havent even donated yet.
---
In my defense, it was a very strange set of circumstances.
---
Actually, after I realized you're on PC.. Yeah, I think I can understand that hatred.. But before the inventory stealing and shit, I just wanted to witness just how ridiculous it was over there. I mean, it just sounded like people were spawning the most random things all willy-nilly. 
---
I don't think the majority of them are selfish though, far from it to be honest. That last dupe was honestly hilariously timed with the Gamepass. I'd see a level two, open a trade to give them some stims and explain the trading screen, only for them to have legacies, 2525 fixers, and god tier armor. 
---
I mean, obtaining your dream weapon or even just an above average one that you actually want would be nearly impossible without it.
---
The entire region's workers were in the process of being replaced by robots when the bombs fell.  You find prostest signs, strikebreaker robots*, journal entries about job losses and economic disaster, etc.  The rich families literally look down on the workers who make them money.  All about that labor and that capital.
---
* I really enjoy blowing up strikebreaker robots.
---
Because I dislike that playstyle. No reason to be rude. It still is high intelligence, the only difference is I’m not using low health to do it.
---
say what?
---
Also want to get the best cards like charisma or the special cards like which cards to pick
---
foreal like how long did they take to make this "community event" should have been working on bugs like the fast travel 🤣 either way if you have to change the event to make it happen for a community that whernt happy with it in the first place maybe should listen or wait let me get it in words Bethesda know "it just works"
---
Having new content is pointless if we can't even use it properly.. fix the bugs and make a playable game. I don't get why people want new content pushed out instead of first having a solid foundation to implement all the new additions.
---
you can add me if you want. scottienoeyes
---
I guess I would like to see more gear toward military BDUs with thigh weapon holsters. Or Black fatigues with the Silver SS badge a on look left chest with silver colored rank on shoulders. Didn't mean to offend anyone, I guess I just want more manly outfits.
---
You speak for everyone here? Video Game? You're the one taking swings and getting personnel, making demeaning generalisations and assumptions about people's nationalities. It's just a video game, no need to attack people.
---
Ok!

sometimes i'll build one of those small generators just as a lure

---
very quick and easy to check
---
I think maybe you are getting confused, quite a few of the events have mechanics that can be exploited, things like campfire tales can be farmed for acid by delaying progress, one violent night is another, although Bethesda tweaked it recently.
---
To anyone struggling for treasure notes all i can sag is Hang in, I have 300+ can't turn them in fast enough. You will get to that point I promise,
---
I run a bloodied non-stealth unarmed build and works perfectly
---
I still find it risible when I snipe someone with my eyepatched eye at the scope. The choice of eye being patched is hilariously bad and it has never been addressed. Much like using the wrong hand for drawing and holding bows (due to the pipboy).
---
I suspect it is item related... I removed everything and now it's not crashing. Well not so far anyway...
---
Edit: Nope. Crashing again.
---
do you really think that dupers care about this event at all? if they have 200mio cork they still won't donate a single one, and if it would not matter since who would stand there and click million times the chest while having to resupply each few minutes due the weight.
---
this event is little to nothing more then another fuckup to the comunity.
---
Yeah, when you have the mask equipped it changes from the pip-boy. It's more like a flashlight.
---
It'd be funny, if it wasn't so sad.
---
So so weird lol. Just glad we can move on haha.
---
oh man the lakeside cabins when someone has a camp out in the lake they will just spawn out there even outside of rifle range. i don't mind doing the defend events, as long as the stuff doesnt spawn in dumbass places or the wave timer takes like 4 minutes to reset
---
I literally said this exact thing playing last week
---
Is this really the complaint?
---
Chasing after a novelty set of gear with the perfect rolls that's completely unnecessary for any build?
---
That's why we should effectively ruin the game?
---
What are you planning on grinding for after you finish your SS set?
---
You would judge a whole culture based on one person's comments on a social media platform? Wow. What an ignorant piece of shit you are.
---
Tell me about it.  It's a common trend to downvote intelligent arguements and respond with
---
"No they're my legendaries"
---
Or "no that's not true"
---
Also at pleasant valley cabins at top of the world, the building to the left of where you spawn has drugs or water in the toilet.
---
You still get the rewards happened to me a lot just can’t loot the body
---
Toilet... Like out of the water. Lol
---
Thanks for the reminder.  I just turned off Recurring Billing so mine will cancel when the term is up.
---
They have not added some of the content they advertised as coming "soon" when they rolled it out, and with the exception of Wastelanders, they've just made the game more of a grind and they keep breaking things that already work.  I've supported the game enough for now.
---
They're still doing hot fixes regularly, sometimes more than once a week. So not sure what you're talking about. 
---
More and more changes are able to be fixed server side and not client side, they do this without people needing to download and it's likely in large part due to the same constant complaints about having to do these large downloads every couple of weeks.
---
This is where the community keeps being their own brick wall, for every response to a problem someone else is going to complain about that change.
---
Now I feel dumb 😂😂 OPs question makes so much more sense now
---
I'm game, but want Whiskey.
---
Off topic, but suggestion to help a little bit with the treasury notes.
---
Make sure to do the daily missions that you can, these will aware treasure notes.
---
1. Raider and Settler Daily
---
2. Davenport Daily
---
3. Pumpkin House, whenever it pops up (there are pumpkin patches behind and around the house, so you don't have to go far, equip the one point PER perk that doubles yield)
---
4. Camden Park Daily (I hate lucky mucker)
---
Some people might not be able to play for very long and they don't have time to gather resources so they'd prefer just to buy ammo to save time. It's not a secret you can make ammo for free my dude.
---
like you said yourself, the proof is in the downvotes. folks can act as high horsed as they'd like, everyone. one shots. at some point. bloody hypocrites.
---
doesnt mt blair only award ores? i never bother to do it for exactly why you mentioned
---
Nuka quantum with cola nut restores 60hp/sec for 10 seconds (+30ap/sec)
---
stims with all perks (field surgeon/ first aid) restore 29%/sec for 4 seconds
---
To match the healing effect of Q with stims you need 205 health with all the perks, without first aid you need 300, with no field surgeon you need 415, and with neither you need 600.
---
That ignores the ap regeneration, and the duration, and the stimpack animation, the weight, the farm ability, and the convenience against mobs
---
Super stimpacks are heavy, weighting 1.5, more than quantums 1.
---
Super stimpacks are super tedious to farm, as you mainly get them by doing high level events. Quantums you find around the game world passively while doing other things if you know where to keep your eyes out for them.
---
To use super stimpacks from your quick key requires that you have NO other stimpacks of any kind in your inventory, and using super stims in normal combat is super overkill use of resources, quantums are useful because you only use them when you want them and can carry them at all times without having to drop other items to do pvp.
---
If you are not wearing power armor you have to go through the slow as hell stimpack animation, which kills your pvp ability and leaves you open to dead in the cut throat combat enviroment.
---
Super stims have way too short duration, you can't easily pre-empt combat, stack them on top of themselves, and if the fight drags on you need to use almost 5 : 2 to keep up with quantum which lasts 10 seconds.
---
The ap regeneration of quantums is super important and useful, as the dodgy perk allows you to take 30%(actually more because mechanics) less damage from a hit for 30 ap, so with a quantum you get to take of 30% of the damage of one hit every second, which is a big deal.
---
If you chug 3 quantums you get 180 health per second and 3 dodges per second for 10 seconds. If you take 3 super stims you get effectively your health in healing over 2 seconds, 3 times at the cost of having to be vulnerable for a second each time you go to heal
---
If you chug 10 quantums you regenerate 600hp/second and can dodge 10 times per second, for 10 seconds, making you damn near unkillable to most players, and unless you are wearing power armor you can not stack stimpack to have any hope of matching that, and in order to do so would take an enormous amount (50+). 
---
You just can't do the nutty things that you can do with nuka colas with stimpacks.
---
1:1 they seam comparable, but to survive serious pvp you need to use multiples, as there are people out there who CAN kill a player who has taken 30 quantums. think about that. 1800 health per second and 30% less damage taken 30 times per second and there are people who can still kill you.
---
VATS is very buggy rn
---
Can't up vote this enough
---
You’re pushing your luck there. How about a blight mushroom soup recipe?
---
I’ve tried unequipping gun fu, but not adrenaline. I will have to try this out. Thank you for sharing :)
---
Games like fo76 rely on this business model: spend a bunch of development  money up front, fire most the development staff once the game is launched, release trickle content until no players are playing
---
FO 1st and the Atom store are trickle content... this game makes a lot of money on trickle I imagine 
---
&gt;That’s why it doesn’t matter if we look up the exact earnings
---
Yeah... well actually exact earnings would tell the full story.
---
Yea so when you die it does the count down for you to respawn but doesn’t let you, and you get nothing for it. I just picked up they game again because I played when it came out but there just wasn’t enough content, but now the game is in a horrible state with new bugs that I encounter everyday.
---
Oh!  I didn't think it could be done without help.  The health drain is so fast I find.  Do you just crush the stimpacks and keep at it?  Stay hidden?  Would love some advice because I am really hoping to get Fixer plans at some point.
---
Yea well he knows how long it will take to get that cork and concrete
---
What platform?
---
Is this what Todd wanted?
---
I dont even bother with the radio anymore.
---
with extra blight?
---
If I’m correct, you can access the terminal with your pip boy even if someone else uses it. I remember when the same think happened to me while starting uranium fever and I just tried to grab the terminal and when I did it, my pip boy opened up with all the options from the terminal.
---
What!? People are finding more cork than concrete? That's a lot of golf balls and globes. Or people are going ape shit crafting and scrapping pipe weapons, but that adds up in steel and wood after a while. Who knows mate, maybe it's the meteor shower doing weird things to people.
---
&gt; See, I'm the opposite, I've only had FO1st for 3 months, but I use scrapper, and I loot everything that isn't nailed down
---
This is how I have played all the fallout games.  (3, NV, 4).
---
I started with FO1st;  without I wouldn't have lasted a week in the game.
---
I would tear down the rest of Charleston to give to the NCR
---
i can't remember ever seeing anyone take beckley mine
---
Extra blight will cost you an additional 50 concrete scrap
---
Launch the game.
---
[https://youtu.be/HTZMHMd1wBs](https://youtu.be/HTZMHMd1wBs)
---
That's an example of a typical run. I use a full set of TS armor &amp; a Vampire Gauss Minigun
---
We can stack both cranberry relish and juice? I need to try that! My current feeding routine is relish, carrot soup, corn soup and brain fungus soup all of which stack. Berry and orange Mentats are my drugs of choice. Orange I think kind of makes mowing down large mobs crispier but maybe it’s in my head...
---
Yea it happens to everyone i think. If you get into and back out of ur pa tho itll reset
---
I'm just calling you out for being a bit of a flog, have a nice day
---
Add me as well. twisted3757. Currently bored and looking for things to do lol
---
&gt; Let's be real; there isn't a damn player in this game who isn't secretly grateful dupers have duped.
---
Here is one.
---
Start the game?
---
Wow!  Didn't expect concrete to be achieved to be honest.  I added 250 steel on day one and nothing since.
---
It all comes down to licensing at the end of the day. I wonder what kind of structure they use. For an online game like this, I wonder if they could get a broadcast license. It wouldn’t be cheap, and honestly not sure how it would work internationally.
---
Yes that! I know I missed. I’m a sad wastelands
---
Edit: Clarified that it's the type of comment that is silly, not the person posting it.
---
TL;DR: FO76's problems start and end with Bethesda Game Studio. The ZeniMax that makes ESO isn't the ZeniMax that owns Bethesda and holding companies don't dilute their value by "bailing out" subsidiaries/affiliates that aren't performing well. That just isn't how the world works.
---
I'm sorry but this is a silly comment that comes up a lot here. For one, FO76 was in development before they got acquired. For two, it's not even how companies work.
---
[ZeniMax Media](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZeniMax_Media) holds many properties and it's value is based on those. It owns Id Software, Arkane Studios, Bethesda Game Studios, and ZeniMax Online (where ESO is), to name but a few.
---
A holding company isn't going to "fund" a subsidiary. For one, these were all successful properties in their own right. If they weren't they wouldn't have been bought unless the intellectual property (IP) was deemed valuable enough. If it was the latter case, Bethesda would have been gutted when they were acquired.
---
Each subsidiary has its own CEO who makes their own damn decisions. If they don't make "good" decisions, they get replaced. The CEO of the parent company doesn't go micromanage the subsidiary, they just get a new CEO. If the subsidiary is failing, they will assess desolving the company.
---
This is *business*. It's not all one wallet, even if the accounting is centralized. Cost centers (e.g. departments) fight for and get their own budget. They have to work to stay in that budget. If they don't, bad things happen. Likewise it's segregated by legal entities (e.g. Bethesda vs Id) for the larger budgets these cost centers are part of. Moving money around, particularly across country borders, costs money. So you minimize that as best you can.
---
FO76's problems start with Bethesda Game Studio Montreal. That's who worked on the game originally and did the majort of the work. If Bethesda Game Studio Austin and/or Dallas is doing it now, that's how Bethesda decided to run things.
---
FO76 has its own team of people and it's own budget and revenue stream. All of their problems are their own. Some of them are inherited from the initial design, but they are running things now so any continued bad decisions come down to the people actually working the game *today*. No outside force needs to, will be, or should be involved.
---
This usually works.  I can't say if it works here or not.
---
He most likely disconnected or got dropped. When you see players with no clothes on, it usually means they have dc’d. But it is possible that person was just being annoying too.
---
Lmao can't believe they won't invest even a little bit
---
In his defense, maybe he was bugged.
---
I hate that event, everytime I try to interact with that terminal my character gets stucked in an endless walking animation and never reaches it. Can't cancel the animation, interact with the terminal, fast travel... nothing, I'm stucked forever until an enemy downs me or I force the game the close.
---
Edit: [This is what I was talking about](https://youtu.be/6MfmA22BrZo). That footage is from FO4, but is the exact same bug.
---
&gt; So you can say, with close to complete certainty that you have never traded for an item that was duped?
---
If someone gives me counterfeit currency - does that suddenly make me "happy" they counterfeited it?  Of course not.
---
Hey mods, can we have a drinking game where we take a shot every time someone breaks Rule 9?
---
It is sadly, lol 95% chance to hit a ghoul standing perfectly still and miss 6 shots on it
---
And it was very easy for me to switch over to a Shotgunner Build on my main, that was Melee/Heavy Guns.
---
Maybe! Actually, you could be right - all the cork being donated, it's definitely a load of balls!
---
Do the old dailies (Camden, pumpkin house, etc.) award treasury notes now?
---
With as easy as it was to dupe junk, and a stashbox makes it weightless, why wouldn't you
---
I saw someone do something this same jerkish behaviour with Enlightenment. They went around killing all the bugs &amp; frogs so nobody could get them. Then he never turned them in.  Some people just want to see the world burn and annoy others.
---
This happened to me once, guy hops on the terminal, then crashes.
---
Server took like 4 mins to kick him, so it failed.
---
I am curious on how to get the PIP Boy to work in this kind of a case
---
game need a change for aspect to how beth can make money with it.. how this game afford servers up &amp; running without new stuff?
---
Imagine if you got like 4 million cork!
---
It wasn't wastelanders, it was the patch after that started the VATs issues.
---
I was thinking some of this bug bounce back maybe relates to working from home and maybe some scripts having mixed revisions from various work release candidates but this "unfixing" issue has existed before January. 
---
Maybe still part of the issue if multiple studios like Dallas, Austin and any others have cross wires somewhere in the syncing process.
---
Dunno about private server but other worlds people will be taking them maybe even taking lots and selling them for the challenge
---
Oh, yeah, I remember that guy, lol!  That was hilarious.
---
Private servers don't have bobble heads magazines or cap stashes.
---
There are other interesting things in other places.
---
So their events are autocompleting also?
---
Okay fair enough! If someone is nice to me, I'll be nice back. If someone is a cunt, I'll be a cunt right back, pretty simple concept actually. Have a good one! Keep working on those jokes.
---
noooooooo.. seriously?
---
There are a number of reasons:
---
1.) The community reward sucked. Since the individual rewards ALSO suck, no one has any reason to donate.
---
2.) It is much harder to get concrete. I believe someone said there are only like 300 units per server lying around. And everyone has to compete for these. And who wants to bother with the hassle of taking a workshop for concrete, just for rewards that suck?
---
3.) This reward DOES NOT suck.
---
4.) You can scrap pipe weapons for cork, and pipe weapons are dropped by like half the enemies. No competing for resources like you would with concrete.
---
5.) Concrete is actually USEFUL. And because it is both useful and comparatively hard to come by, people are going to be much more stingy about giving it away.
---
Would they be able to just put in some songs from past games?
---
And maybe a waifu pillow for the camp
---
It’s 1400, but yes. And it will reset 20 hours after you first sell something to any of them.
---
No problem. Please let me know if it works for you.
---
Yes, it is a major improvement compared to launch.
---
you got rekt
---
I think they need to just ditch this whole daily challenge thing and find a different way to award score. 
---
Maybe do it the way they do treasury notes and bullion, but instead of treasury notes award arcade tickets that you turn in at a machine that converts it to score (like you turn in tickets at an arcade and they tally your points total for claiming prizes), and like the bullion from smiley let us bribe Fuzzy Brenda or the Boss at camden park with bottlecaps for a weekly chunk of score instead of doing an XP based weekly grind. I'd rather grind for caps (from events, selling stuff, doing special events like atlas) than grind for XP.
---
&gt; But scrap is not rendered by the client. To either the host player or any visitors. To them it is just a database entry, which your AWS handles great, and why there are no limits. 
---
That's still client side, and if it isn't rendering only when selected and/or is -pre-caching every single model in the list then there's something very wrong with the client-side code.  
---
&gt; Here is another post where someone explained it better than I, way less passive aggressive: 
---
That explains a lot,  unfortunately I wish there was some way for them to higher the CAMP limit and maybe allow players to have a client-side config to render stuff in a lower poly or something similar. Anyway I do hope that the CAMP internal spaces thing that's coming helps.
---
Wouldn't take anything waster1993 says serious. He's the 1 terrible troll on this subreddit, every subreddit has at least one.
---
Low level players won't even have the location of the observatory on their map, let alone know the location unless they looked it up, or even get to it because it's in the divide.
---
i think that happens when they get killed by other random mobs or other players
---
&gt;pretty much the whole gaming community dislikes and makes jokes about it
---
Pretty much the whole gaming community has their head up their ass.  Play what you like, on what platform you like.  Don't yuck someone else's yum.
---
Maybe someone was hiding, waiting for someone to get into the workshop zone so they could "claim" it and kill you since you were "contesting" it. That's my best guess anyway.
---
I think we need to stage an intervention for you guys. At first, it wasn't too suspicious that you had a few hundred from baseballs, globes, and golf balls; weird, but not suspicious.
---
And now you are stumbling around the wasteland, crying about your exes, and the way you clutch that corkscrew.. 
---
If only we paid more attention to you; we should have spoken up before you were 3000 bottles of wine deep, with their corks just thrown into a box, rambling on about something called atlas. I'm sorry we failed you.
---
Ok thank you
---
No, that’s utter baloney. No idea where they got that idea from. 
---
I just went farming for all three yesterday. Had a good haul as well.
---
That’s utterly incorrect.
---
I wanna know why I can't display the meat cleaver 😤 I need it for my kitchen display
---
The outer worlds was one
---
I was going to say... Private servers is how I played all the story content as a solo, and I had bobble heads.
---
That is literally the most untrue thing I've read all day and I've spent the entire day on the internet.
---
I never knew the Pumpkin House and Camden Perk dailys awarded Treasure note xD
---
Thank you all. I’m doing the main storyline missions now. I’ve been delayed to do them since doing the daily’s and public events take most of my time up when I play.
---
I'm reading all those bugs &amp; as far back as I recall, I've only experienced one of those. I have about 1125 hours invested in the game &amp; for the record I've played NW once so IDK about those ones. The most problematic bug I ever had was a 'spawn beacon' that kept following me around for days. At natural spawn points in the game, I would get an empty government supply drop just land in front of me as I approached, or an already dead scorchbeast. They even used to land on my bed in my CAMP which prevented me from sleeping. It eventually cleared after about a week perhaps via a backdoor patch?
---
 The doors sticking me in a load screen forever was a pain too. I had that one a few times.
---
 Enemies just standing around making for easy kills, that's a bug that's not being mentioned. Made nuking Whitesprings a breeze since the ghouls were completely unresponsive to your presence. Enemies getting stuck during defence missions at workshops &amp; they get stuck so far away that you have to run outside of the defense zone to find them... that is most annoying.
---
Aside from that, nothing has been game-breaking for me. Maybe I got lucky. The game is a far cry better than what it was in the BETA and at release. Personally, and this is just my personal opinion from having &gt;1000 hours in it, I can overlook the minor bugs that are often present in my game because everything else is good. 
---
My biggest peeve with this is the cheaters &amp; hackers that only destroy it for everyone else, because every time people do this, it forces Bethesda to take actions that ultimately punish everyone. Stop cheating! 
---
Playing on Xbox.
---
Will try this and report back!
---
I’ve heard it’s what 76 is to Fallout. A highly offensive rip off.
---
This, it doesn't actually exsist until you've loaded the game once. Try running it again and see if the file appears, adjust some settings.
---
agreed
---
Maybe this will help even though everyone is looking for them right now
---
Click on the sub, the three dots on the corner and then on change user flair
---
Cool story, bro. How long did it take you to type that out?
---
Really needs a tl;dr thrown in there somewhere, though.
---
I can dig it that would be hella cool. I get outta work around 8 ill hit ya up!
---
1400 :(
---
I was the same way. Fallout 4 would freeze up for like 5 seconds when I accessed the box at my base I had so much crap. I've been playing 76 since a couple months after release. The weight management isn't really that bad once you figure out the difference between what you truly NEED and how much of it, and what you are just compulsively hoarding because it MIGHT be useful.
---
76 is always changing.  There have been ups and downs from the beginning but overall it is a very enjoyable and unique game.  There is nothing like it.  Don't miss it.
---
This is 100% the issue. They probably have a team of like 3 people if that dealing with all the bugs.
---
You cannot complete the bobble head daily by buying one.  You have to find it in the wild.
---
Quest markers will explain everything
---
Its not all of them. I events I mostly see this happen are tea time, free range and for some odd reason swarm of suiters. People trigger them then travel away. 
---
It may however be rare and I've had some very bad luck recently. But I felt to post about it anyway.
---
There are some mothman cultist camps scattered here and there. I have even seen one where they were all kneeling and there was ain invincible, stationary hostile mothman who just sat in the camp, not sure if it was a bug.
---
There's one on the east side of the bog, to the east of bog town and near the edge of the map past the bunker. There actually lots, a couple in the divide too.
---
Concrete is not harder to collect lmao. There are literal spots on the map where you can extract 120 an hour. There may be less spawns for concrete, but there aren’t many for cork either. And pipe weapons give 1 cork, primarily in low level areas. High level mutants drop assault rifles and combat rifles. Even Line in the Sand with its constant flow of enemies only averages a small handful of pipe weapons. Out of the event on average I get 10-15 cork. I could farm Grafton Steel Mutants for cork and walk out with maybe 100 in an hour. So to say it’s way easier is a huge stretch. I would’ve had a metric ton of it in my Scrapbox by this point if that was true. I still have a couple hundred more concrete than cork. Their rarity is fairly even across the board. It’s certainly not 14x more common than concrete (4.65 million concrete day one, 65.3 million cork day one)
---
E: my original estimate of 100 cork from Grafton Steel was a tad high. After a quick run through I ended with 9 cork. About 1/3 of the weapons were pipe weapons, 1/3 hunting rifles, 1/3 laser rifles, and the rest were miscellaneous melee weapons
---
A lot of these were nuclear winter focused but a few weren’t like the fast travel bug.
---
The ADS has happened a few times in adventure particularly with the handmade.
---
Can you even get a Legendary Shishkebab? I honestly haven't found one yet..
---
HOLY FRAK!!1!!
---
I think this has fixed it. hit like 5 95% shots in a row with my gauss shotgun
---
put the cards back on and still hitting those 95% shots
---
**AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!** 
---
I could kiss you (with consent and when there's no plague of course)
---
Yeah, I think it would make more sense. Maybe have it be a randomly generated name like Domino, Red, [Buttface](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wounded_dog?mobile-app=false) (Dog names you know)?
---
This happens a lot at the different shrines added in wastelanders. Moth home is one of those locations.
---
I dont know how people have so much honestly. I only had 34 when the event started and still only have about 60 odd
---
Help us Duper’s!  You are only hope!
---
Yaaa awesome
---
Then why aren't we turning in legacy weapons to these puds at Atlas?
---
I believe there is about 4 weeks left. Bethesda mentioned seasons would last about 10 weeks. We just finished week #6.
---
:( I want 19000 caps for a recipe but it’s so hard to get that much
---
I very well could be wrong. I never pay much attention to rewards.
---
Scripts definitely, now that I think about it... not sure about notes, sorry.
---
Why would anyone want that in a Fallout game?
---
I mean modders make all kinds of wierd stuff like that.
---
Typically free range, tea time and swarm of suitors. I dunno why swarm of suitors as it doesn't fail if the mirelerks get on the island but yesterday I pissed some one majourly but actually doing that event and not letting it fail.
---
Yeah I’m in for a dog companion, have it be randomly generated (Wild Mongrel, Junkyard Dog, etc.) hangin our at our CAMP.
---
The game is pretty cheap so even if u dislike it u dont rly spend much but there is much to do and with friends its pretty fun
---
not if the rights holder of the music wasn’t stupid. Licenses are for specific uses. Selling permission to use a song in one game doesn’t carry over to any other
---
Thanks for the tips but I think I need to elaborate more.. I meant Im still a noob even though I have been playing since launch and still feel like I should be a level 150. (I used to just fuck around in low level areas building and scrapping and really just playing it safe, I have 92 unused perk cards last time I checked) But leveling up is just grinding and my lvl 240 does not mean I have a shit ton combat/gaming experience in this game. 
---
Anyway way, I have an average of 450 carry weight so if I switch over to chinese stealth armor Im way over carry weight.  So the suit is just for my stash. 
---
Recently I made a very good friend who helped me get some really good gear and I am now only just gaining confidence to do stuff on my own in high lvl areas. So what I guess I am trying to say is that these high levels are just grinded levels and not necessarily people who did vault raids and do things like solo strangler heart mission... or even NW. Fml that makes my heart race!
---
there's a cultist camp down by Vault 96, they are worshiping every time I go there.
---
Alright everyone, gather ‘round for the Enclave group huddle.
---
very cool
---
Agree with scottafol - what is it you are trying to accomplish?
---
General advice:
---
Stay in the forest (gren area, west side of map) until you are about L15-20.   Do events, learn the lore. Gain XP.  Join the responders.  Start the mysteries quest.  Join the BoS (recruitment blues).  visit Biv.
---
At 15-20, head north to the big alligator (toxic valley).  Roam that area until about L25.  Join the pioneer scouts.
---
then head S to the ash heap.  At 30, start the miner miracles quest.  Join the firebreathers
---
At 40, head into the divide (center strip)
---
at 50+, go into the Mire and Bog (east)
---
The game will not stop lower level players from going to inappropriate areas, but it does not currently scale enemies down.  
---
For example, Roses questline is easy to get, and it initially sends you to a low level area, but quickly redirects you to places a low level will be brutalized by high level enemies - best to back burner that one until you are around L40.  If you don't complete it until L50, you will get a much better reward.
---
In the divide and eastward, enemies are either max level or will scale to the highest level player in the area, so depending on what you are up to, you may not want a bunch of high levels around :)
---
Even something like watch your back when you try to complete one of the Mysteries questlines.... that one can be iffy.    If you server hop, you will eventually find a server with relatively low level enemies where you need to go.  (9-32 instead of the usual 40-62).
---
At Uranium fever, there's usually a number of high levels, and the enemy is capped at 3\* L42.  But a L42 mole miner can hit a L20 player quite hard....adn there are a lot of them.
---
You log of pissed over a video game? You kids need to adult up,. #GENERATIONSOFTBITCHES
---
That's exactly why I want to pick it up! I don't want to miss out on anything.
---
this here muckin' fuckin' sucks
---
It really sucks for us casual/ working stiffs who don't have the time or inclination to grind that crap. I am at like lvl 22 of it and i don't look at or care about the rewards. I too wish daily atom rewards would be put back in. If they thought it would get me to purchase atoms they were sorely mistaken.
---
AHHH. Thank you. Been on reddit for 4 years and never be this was a thing. You're awesome. Long live the mothman.
---
AND NOW IT'S BACK TO MISSING AGAIN. oops caps
---
I don’t use gun-fu and hadn't even put points in to adrenaline on my stealth commando/rifleman and gauss rifle shots in VATS miss 95% of the time, every time as of last night. Charging before hitting vats or entering and exiting vats 2 or 3 times before firing works but at that point why bother? I just put them in my stash box with my gauss shotgun and will wait until this gets addressed.
---
You absolutely could take a workshop and extract concrete. But why would you go through the hassle when the rewards for donating sucks, and the community reward also sucks too? You're assuming people will be willing to constantly go back and check on the extractor, or sit there and babysit it, in the name of gathering resources for something they don't actually want, whereas all they have to do is passively collect cork for something they DO WANT, by killing things, which they WILL do.
---
Nah it was pretty fucking great. It's more fallout than fallout 4 really even was
---
Thank you for your feedback. I updated the comment.
---
And to be clear, *you* are not silly for having posted your original comment. It's made by a lot of people that don't understand how for profit organizations work structurally. 
---
You are, however, silly for how you responded to new information.
---
Also... how do you even get the mods for a silenced lever action at lvl 60??
---
Or sell it back to us in bulk at Whitesprings...
---
You just reminded me of another bug I get, rarely, but when I get it, I have no choice but to restart my game. It's a visual bug where my FoV becomes terribly distorted &amp; everything around me except for a tiny portion directly in front, is so blurry I can't make things out. That one is the only 'game breaking' bug I've had.
---
Welcome:)
---
I've got a pair of fallout playlists on Spotify. One I made which matches more the feel of 3&amp;4, and a playlist I found for 76. Both are good lists. Love listening to them when I'm at work.
---
savage 😂
---
The problem I found was early game - things like stimpacks, purified water - were GOOOLD.  So once you get a little higher, and suddenly have a surplus, why wouldn't you save them up?
---
My first attempt at doing the nuclear silo - I ran out of stimpacks!  One of my early nuclear blast site explorations - I ran out of radaways.  
---
Now, I find an average day accounts for a net drop (over what I use) of about 100 stimpacks.  But until you realize it... ugh.
---
Right now - I shuffle a lot of crap out to a mule account.  But that's really due to 2 things;  vendor cap limit, and scrip limit.  If you could recycle unlimited legendaries a day - and I wasn't trying to get a bunch of caps - It would be easy.
---
I'm a wear some events can be exploited, hence why radiation rumble rewards are stupid rare xD but no I mean they are trying to fail them. Then actually do others with loads of adds. 
---
I'm not new ether, just want the jetpack on all 3 of my characters which is like over 3000 bullion hahah
---
&gt;	and then being a Battle-Royale really bummed me out and I cancelled my preorder.
---
Wait what? The game is not a battle royale. They did add a battle royale mode 6-8 months *after* launch, but it was never part of the main gameplay. 
---
Anyway, the game has certainly improved a lot since launch and based on the way you frame a few things in this post I think you’ve been misled a little bit. the game was very buggy in 2018, and that certainly has improved. Don’t get me wrong. 
---
If you like exploring, fighting enemies, upgrading gear, and taking your time to get immersed in a large open world in the fallout universe I say go for it. The lore is really interesting and the world is well-designed. It is online-only, but it’s not really a big deal if you have decent access to internet.
---
Absolutely. If you're bloodied heavy with unyielding gear you don't even need melee perks to do insane damage. Just talons and twisted muscles.
---
Its not unrealistic to expect monthly or bi-monthly updates and bug fixes. Nobody is expecting a new wastelanders every month or three, but every patch is 1-3 steps forward and two backward and its taking them a month or two just to fix bugs they introduced in their most recent patch which is what is causing threads like these to become popular. I can name several giant and hugely successful studios that update frequently and with better community communication and interaction. We are dealing with attrition for failing to meet promised expectations and back to back controversies with seemingly no big controversy free updates that I can recount since wastelanders on top of pointless non-answer communication which ignores all the major issues and bugs. At a certain point it doesn't matter what is happening behind the scenes, they need to get their house in order and they have had 2 years to do it and here we all are still bitching about the same day-1 bugs.
---
Lmao no.
---
That's fair, cheers for your input thought :)
---
Yeah. I drank 6 drinks, got the notification I was addicted to alcohol (confirmed in pip boy effects) but saw no change in junkie weapon damage listing.
---
Aaronholt homestead has 3 spawn locations. 
---
2 in the houses, 1 more in the shed way down the hill.
---
Put panapickedopeckopickledpeckersgraphist perk on and keep your ear out.
---
Edit: perceptibobble! That's what it's called, somebody's else mentioned it in another comment.
---
tried removing the cards again and it's missing again. put them back on and still missing. WTF
---
Come help the free state of Appalachia against the tyranny of the Enclave by donating supply and ammunition. Mainly needing rations. .45 caliber. 5.56. And 5mm ammunition
---
RNG is RNG. Equip the Percepti-bobble perk.
---
https://map76.com/lvli/lpi_loot_bobbleheadslvli0001911d
---
Glad to see it may be working for you. I think the thing is you need to keep those cards unequipped. Also, try to time entering and firing in VATS the moment your weapon hits full charge. That seems to be what works for me.
---
Just get your 1400 a day, and sell legendaries in your vendor. You’ll have that in no time. 
---
What serum are you trying to craft? Are you planning on selling them? There are cheaper ways to get a serum if you just want one for yourself.
---
But we don’t have them. So it doesn’t mean much to speculate. I’m extremely curious what games you think creates an online structure with the dozens of extra upkeep costs required to operate and then lets it die. Destiny has gone on for a long time thriving on dlc content - they don’t even charge for the base game now. Gta 5 has pulled rockstar through for nearly a decade at this point with constant updates, Ark, Minecraft, Rust, Fortnite, Apex, WoW, Runescape. All these games thrive by maintaining a large playerbase consistently, which happens through new content. 
---
“Trickle content” would be games like Assassin’s Creed or CoD, and require massive amounts of money and public attention to make work. Bethesda has been regularly bringing staff back onto F76 for bigger updates. Nothing indicative that they plan on leaving the game to die after they released it, especially now that it’s been almost 2 years and they’re still seeing major activity spikes with their dlc
---
Even games without server farms to maintain still try to keep their playerbase stable for at least a couple years after release. F76 definitely didn’t uproot every proven formula Bethesda has for making money just so they could sit back and watch it die out.
---
If you held the select button you started claiming /contesting the workshop and someone killed you.
---
See, I end up with a constant surplus of stimpacks, since I rarely use them. I have to constantly sell the damned things off since I can't run the weight reduction perk with my build. I carry 15 regular and 15 super stimpacks, and have 10 regular stimpacks in my box in case of emergency.
---
there are well over a dozen PA spawns in the forest alone.  
---
There are at least 4 in Morgantown, and 3 at wade airport.
---
At L39, working on the minor miracles quest for Excavator is a good idea.
---
wondering that myself
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/de/events this link should work here is everything related to atlas
---
5 locations in Watoga that they can spawn. all on the outside.  use the perk card to help find them.
---
Cav.
---
no relation to the New Charleston Revolutionaries?
---
I agree, we need to be able to build more stuff at our CAMPs. I also love the Flamingo Units. Found this yesterday  [https://imgur.com/gallery/WrSSEfH](https://imgur.com/gallery/WrSSEfH)   
---
I ordered a spare tire cover with that on it so people can see Bigfoot and his FU
---
Thanks, I always forget about that... Perk loadouts can't get here fast enough
---
Agreed, I stopped looking for them and then I accidentally found one haha go figure.
---
ah, should have known....
---
You not interested in 250x Nocturnal pipe pistols? I have a source or two that can hook you up ;)
---
I found one when i logged in after reset. Didn't even know it was a challenge. I logged off at lost home. Two can spawn there. 
---
Also a challenge isn't meant to be easy.
---
This happened to me a couple of days ago on the Xbox and I got really pissed off. I accidentally figured a way out around it.
---
My right thumb went over onto the closest to buttons to the thumbstick, X &amp; A, and I rolled  it  across the other two buttons. It popped up to the map screen. 
---
I was able to go over and select to respawn somewhere but I figured I should test it, so I hit B to back out. Could not do anything again and then repeated what I did the first time, from X &amp; A to Y &amp; B and the map screen popped up again. I was able to travel to a friend of mine at the event and pick up all my stuff.
---
Hope that description sounds good enough but I showed it to a couple of other people and it's worked for them.
---
Ive seen cultists in random encounters; might be what you’re referring to
---
Id like to see "Dual Wielding" of pistols be an option.  Actually any "1 handed weapon" should have a dual wield option.  It probably ought to be a perk...or otherwise made easier with a perk.  
---
Equip an off-hand weapon.  Lose 50% accuracy to both weapons.  They have separate fire rates and ammo counts.  Reload speed reduced by 25%.  Removes the ability to zoom/iron sight/block.  
---
Duel Wielding Perk (AGI) 3x rank - Each rank reduces accuracy loss by 10% (down to 20% from 50% at mastery) and increases reload speed by 5% (down to 10% from 25% at mastery)  
---
It'd be nice, but I know that's a MAJOR code change and don't expect to ever see it.  It would be a nice-to-have though.
---
I love it!!!! I am definitely picking him up as well. 
---
My camp is a roadside stop but very junky out on the porch.
---
And my second character has a massive junkyard lol. I love seeing fellow dwellers also have junkyards. You on PS4? Id love to see it! 
---
Ps: with the mothman items I always wanted to have a locked door at my camp with "employees only" sign and a door showing tons of cultist shit inside.
---
Yup, I use my alt for this as well....I leveled him to 50, basicly just to launder legendarys through mughmuuaghhg, when my main char hit the script limit for the day.
---
Now that we have the daily "level up" challenge, he's over 100
---
I think we should all get shoulder mounted guns for PA.  BUT the kicker.  The guns only fire when the player is yodelling over voice.
---
Now picture a SBQ battle.
---
Dang, I didn't mean to say that it was only a BR, sorry for the confusion.
---
Your last paragraph is exactly the feeling I miss from playing the series. Getting wrapped up in an open world with lore and story rich gameplay is what I love about games. Definitely gonna pick it up.
---
Nah, if you're just "enjoying the game" you won't complete it. I don't really like how the LR changes how I play the game, so I stopped paying attention to it as much. I put in like 5-6 hours a week probably, and I'm level 35. I'm not even in the vicinity of completing it. 
---
The only way to get it is to grind it. More power to folks that have that sorta time, go for it, enjoy it. Regardless, you can't just casually walk your way to this finish line.
---
All, drops in the bucket. Perhaps when the bucket is full, someone might do something.
---
Agreed. And while I giggled at the quakecon fast travel bug they showed, the way she just played it off did sting. Switching to what she got as a drop and not really saying anything about that issue is a bummer. I know it's probably not her job but dang. The QoL fixes that are needed will never outweigh the constant monetary additions they will push first.
---
I would prefer if the game gave us score based on our daily missions instead of daily challenges, that would at least give us a fool-proof way of getting the damn points.
---
I wish you could stick it onto the grinder section.
---
Top of the world has a bunch.
---
having a pistol and a machete or rather a pistol and a melee weapon, would need to get interesting with the mechanics...but would still work and be a nice change to fighting styles....
---
So I’m rank 80, I’ve done maybe three Nuclear Winter rewards this whole run.  I missed a combined 6 days worth of Dallies.  Have yet to feel the need to spend atoms on this event.  I’m still on track to finish early.  I play casually ( an hour a day ).  I don’t feel exhausted, still very much enjoying this event.  I’ve also changed my build mid event because I got two “crappy” rolls from mama magugurgle and was sick of my luck. Used the level up challenges to change my build from full health .50 cal tank, to a super stealth unyielding vampire switch blade build.  
---
I think people are so used to getting everything right away with online games and force themselves to grind this game until they hate it.
---
Just channel your inner dude, sit back, and just enjoy the game.  I’m still going to earn all the prizes you did and I get the added bonus of not hating the game and myself
---
Enclave one for X01
---
Huh???  🤔
---
Just as long as I can nuke the station and not have to listen to pinko garbage ever again.
---
I don't see a valid suggestion that for once lacks inflammatory language is considered entitled. This subreddit should belong to those who have ideas to share with a mature overtone. Your comment is what we'd love to see less of here in general.
---
You’re also assuming that there is a greater number of people who truly want a double score weekend. There are already players who have finished the board legitimately already, and many more almost finished. There are also many people who have openly admitted they don’t care if they finish it or not. Then you also have the people boycotting it. 
---
It’s really not that hard to assume that Bethesda will change the rules when they already did for concrete. For all we know every donation is now worth 10. We don’t know. We can’t see the numbers. We can say it could be possible, but again, we don’t know the EXACT number of people playing. We can guesstimate. That’s the best bet we have. I truly don’t think this is going as swimmingly as Bethesda is trying to show it is. I can’t prove it to you, and you can’t prove it to me. At the end of this, we’re both going to walk away with how we think it went down. And neither of us will have the data that Bethesda has to prove otherwise
---
IMHO, yes.
---
For a lot of flexibility, high PER along w/ high STR can net you the perks you need to do well with melee, heavies, and auto/semi auto rifles.
---
Then dedicate 3 in INT to Stabilized.
---
Classfreak2 (or3)  to offset the ballistic accuracy hit you take from twisted muscles.
---
Motion assist servos on your PA for a +2 STR.  SS underarmor shielded(?)  gives +4 STR.
---
Yes. Check bethesda.net and go to Fallout 76. You'll see what mission/resources and progress
---
That doesn't solve the problem of inventory lag. The obvious solution is to cull a bunch of the common stuff that I've been hoarding for no good reason, but it would be nice to have a separate container for outfits so the game doesn't have to load every single article of clothing I own just so I can access the stuff I use frequently.
---
Aye.
---
Like I believe at one point since launch everyone has one shotted once or twice.
---
Good luck! They don’t spoon feed you a lot of the story, so it’s fun piecing together the different parts. Lots of notes and environmental story telling is where the game really shines IMO. 
---
What system are you going to play on?
---
I would only recommend getting the game if you're someone who can create your own fun or just love exploring a big world. The Wastelanders storyline is full of boring characters and equally boring missions, the endgame is focused entirely around rng that limits you to a few rolls a day AND on top of all that the game demands an insane amount of grinding with zero pay off or reward.
---
If you want good gameplay or writing play literally anything else. If you just wanna live a somewhat immersive life as just another survivor in the wasteland it's pretty good for that. It's fun to explore and enemy variety is also a big plus, but you just gotta make your own fun due to the lack of interesting NPCs or quests.
---
Worth like 5-10 bucks just for the world and exploration alone and it's easily the best world in a Bethesda game imo.
---
Send me $20 and I’ll tell you.
---
Bethesda really dropped the ball by not giving every player their own custom-designed version of Fallout 76.
---
Well.... you didn’t check yourself
---
I say thing backwards or jumbled up for fun. Gets people thinking.😉
---
So you're 24 INT and I'm 38.  If you have a high INT build, what do I have, which has 60% more INT than yours?  Oh yeah, an actual high INT build.
---
Yeah i go to Landview Lighthouse and keep server hoping, but yeah it would be nice if they removed that challenge.
---
I'm probably not the only one that would pay for music out of the atom shop. Give us the soundtrack from previous games or maybe even different Bethesda titles. I would pay atoms for that. Music from Doom 4 during the queen fight would make it more enjoyable.
---
I would like a companion that stays with me, like a dog.  Make me complete some Lassie quest line, and be rewarded with a lifelong buddy.
---
I had completed all daily challenges yesterday, but I did have them tracked. Maybe the tracking does have something to do with it. I also had weeklies tracked but unfinished, but none of my weeklies auto-completed.
---
Thank you, been on read it for a long time and I'm just now finding out about the slide-out panels on the side and such. I use Sync so not all of the same options are everywhere.
---
I’ve actually had 76 for a month and I haven’t run into any issues with gameplay. It’s been pretty smooth
---
The only user Flair showing for me is this Fallout 76 one.
---
Player Yodelling activated shoulder mounted weapons for power armour.  
---
I need to see a SBQ event with that mechanic.
---
Finally a reason to buy all those stupid mounted head plans.
---
There we go! Make it an event, "shut down the commies". Oh! Make it a PvP event where players must identity as communist or American. The communist must repair the station after the nuke, the Americans try and kill them, or something. That would be crazy.
---
I'd prefer some more lines from the radio announcer. The same lines starting and ending every other song get extremely irritating after a while.
---
And screws
---
Yay. I haven’t logged in yet today and I’m already dreading this.
---
That's probably what happened, didn't know about that, maybe next time will walk far from workshops, thanks!
---
Shes rare? I found her on like the 2nd day of wastelanders.
---
I find it VERY hard to believe that they have any sort of dev testing. Some issues i will encounter after an update can be found literally 5 mins after playing.  For example - the broken team issue in nuke winter was obvious immediately upon launch..soo..clearly no one on the dev team plays this game...they just add new code and cross some fingers.
---
It seems like they could easily solve this by dedicating some ATOMS to a few users for in-game testing from people that actually play the game.  Instead it seems they look to use the community to tell them about exploits...or bugs in a backdoor kind of way. Then chose to only fix bugs that might cost Bethesda money ( like duping, atom glitches, camp bugs..etc.) Things that lower the game experience sit on a shelf for ages usually.
---
I want a radio to be tuned to any radio frequency.
---
And a jukebox with good tunes rather than classics.
---
Enemy spawns in this game are infuriating, just in general.   Typical scenario: I go to clear  a building of enemies starting on the top floor.   I clear them all out and go to the level below.  Before I know it, enemies are shooting at me from above on the floor that I had just cleared out and there wasn't a single enemy to be found when I was up there a second ago. 
---
And yeah workshops really suck.   At Hemlock holes maintenance I always have to leave the event area to kill the enemies so I can complete the event. Nothing about that makes sense.
---
These puns rock! Granite, miner sedimentary.
---
&gt;I’m extremely curious what games you think creates an online structure with the dozens of extra upkeep costs required to operate and then lets it die. 
---
Anthem and countless other games. Even Valve put out a digital card game that was abandoned.  
---
&gt;Gta 5 has pulled rockstar through for nearly a decade at this point with constant updates  
---
GTA 5 made more money on it's release day then most games make their entire life. I would never say it needs updates to remain profitable..... it being released on the PS7 shows   as much. Skyrim  being released on the PS7 also proves this point.  (the PS7 is a poor joke. I know it'll come true though)  
---
but yeah we can speculate all day.. I really don't think fo76 is in any kind of financial trouble though
---
Gimme a claymore (no not the boom boom rectangle)
---
I will accept tomorrow, had a crazy day today, no time to play xD thanks tho, looking forward to roam together sometime ;)
---
I started fallout 76 with a gun/rifles character. Realised how garbage it is, moved to mainly rifles and now shotgun on that same character.
---
Low level it's easy to manage but when you get yo higher level enemies they'll shred you.
---
yes.  Mrgph has given (sold?) me several.
---
That makes no sense. They planned this out a long time ago. We've known about it for weeks as well, way before Patch 21. The only reason could be so they save face. None of the previous community events failed, so they won't let this one.
---
I never bother charging the guass shotgun. most things are one shot killed. 
---
I did unequip them again and shot some things. missing on 95% again.
---
Yes!, but were only walking near a house and don't have any intention of claiming the workshop, thanks!
---
I noticed the same thing with the bow. I was out there getting headshots like Robin Hood in VATS, then I tried it with Gun Fu....9-10 missed. Interestingly, the follow up targets were fine. Removed the card and back to normal.
---
If you switch the vats target on/off/on it works.  It’s a pain but less annoying than missing. Also found switching from body to head works
---
I don’t have either but the 95 vats still doesn’t work :(((
---
I've missed one day of levelling but it's pretty much the only reason I log in, do the gold stuff and then score dailies. Level 170 now so it's gona start getting quite tiresome. My alt is only level 4 so may switch to them if I don't mind having no guns/perks/mutations.
---
Ahh ok. It’s a movie quote tis why I did not understand what you were referencing. LoL
---
I feel that a challenge shouldn't be 100% RNG based.
---
If it was maybe find or use one, maybe? But even then, I think that is a stretch.
---
Making it weekly, and one, not something like find 3 in a week, I think is tolerable.
---
this would be cool, hollow points, AP rounds, slugs, flechettes etc. shame the game doesn't have many alternate ammo types beyond ultracite. new vegas was good for this I liked using the hunting shotgun and having various ammo types allowed me to use it throughout and simply switch ammo depending on the target's weakness.
---
Thank god I'm so sick of everyone complaining about this
---
It's incredible to me that these posts pop up daily, and always say the exact same thing:
---
1. Fan of the Franchise for years
---
2. Didn't want to try FO76 because it was online
---
3. Didn't want to try FO76 because of a "poor launch"
---
4. But "hearing good things now" and want to try it
---
I guess I don't understand because having been a fan of these games for years myself, I pre-ordered FO76 the day it became available and was playing the BETA the moment the servers went live.
---
Someone was wanting free junk and you fell into their trap.
---
Yeah I totally agree with that! One for Clothing, one for Armor. Would also be handy for Vending and people viewing what stock you have on the map!
---
Gotta locate the magnifying glass first?
---
I have 600 😂
---
Youll get 6 months of nothing and at the end, you get a free avatar.
---
Dupers are already done.
---
You can get the price down to 17,500, FYI. 
---
It will take some time but you can get there. 
---
Sell valuable items in your vendor to other players. Sell undesirable items to the bots. 
---
Example; don’t sell Stimpaks or RadAway to bots; sell them in your vendors for about 20-25% Base Value.
---
Yeah, I see it working as a weekly, because then if you play fairly regularly you should come across one, but a daily is something you should be able to go out and do when you set out to do it. Not RNG.
---
I buy ammo. When I'm approaching max caps I travel around buying all the 5mm and 2mm I can find. After serums and other recipes caps mean nothing so blow it on something you will use.
---
But you would accept it while being totally aware that it was counterfeit? I mean, why would you accept counterfeit money, unless you intended to benefit from it.
---
Or if you didn't know it was counterfeit and you try to deposit it in the bank, you aren't getting it back.  
---
Actually, you're on to something here. Since you are so against it, then you should alert bethesda that you are in possession of a weapon that has 500+ copies and  insist the item is removed from your inventory as you wouldn't dare benefit from such a horrid act.
---
With each addiction (up to a max of 5) you should see your damage increase. You may have unequip and re-equip to get it to refresh in pipboy view
---
I checked over 2 dozen locations on both private and public servers and could not find one. After an hour I gave up, figured I earned enough repeatable xp while looking to make it fine
---
Aw, thats disappointing to hear. Sorry it didn't work out for you after all then.
---
I found mine in 15 minutes. There is one in the face of the crocodile in the water park, toxic valley. Most of the times I found one there. If not, I just do a few server hop.
---
I agree. It just hits me wrong every time I see the  Animation. Pure Bethesda never thinks anything threw just throw it together and release.
---
Easy enough to find? Do you have some secret screw farming place i dont know about?
---
I have about 6 days left. I stopped doing NW challenges several weeks ago once I was sure I'd finish. I'm even considering dropping the daily level up challenge. I'm over level 400 now, and I have 200+ unused level ups, so I don't need any more. Definitely starting to get some burnout. 
---
There should be about 3 weeks between seasons. I hope they bring back the Atom challenges during the break.
---
Nah just skip it
---
Hold b to exit turminals
---
I hit that spot. I guess I’ll server hop if I want it done.
---
ah it's a after market hack they added no wonder it's usefulness is questionable...
---
The game is just riddled with bad design decisions. I wish companies would staff an actual UI/UX designer who could keep joe codemonkey in check from making bad design decisions...
---
The old man wouldn't give me a quest either. I switched to Sophia and was able to do her quest. I havent switched back to the old man to see if it works. Raider punk was working for me for a while, but he quit giving me things to do and I haven't switched back to him yet either.
---
I'm aware of the vats on-off-on workaround as well. This method just seems a bit more smoother to execute for me. Maybe I should edit my post so its a bit more clear? 
---
* Unequip Gun-Fu and Adrenaline (and keep them unequipped)
---
* Fully charge weapon to full 
---
* Activate VATs the moment weapon is fully charged, and fire 
---
* Timing is important; you must time entering and firing in VATS with the weapon hitting full charge
---
It says in the flair this is for PS4
---
So get rid of ‘Kill Legendaries’, then?  Because that’s also RNG based, both for random encounters and whether or not related events will occur. 
---
I can only think of one event that can be forced triggered at will by a player that has a guaranteed legendary.
---
I swap between allies quite often, I’ve noticed that they have to be “placed” in your camp for a little while before they will give you a quest....Not sure if it’s a set amount of time or what. All the times I’ve swapped them out and tried to get a quest shortly after, never seems to work
---
but why would it work like 10-12 times in a row and then not? It's WACK!
---
Same. Because we want to see for ourselves?
---
I would like for ways for us to add a temporary 4th or 5th 'star'
---
Nothing too wild, certainly no more outright damage bonuses.
---
For guns we could apply gun oil that could increase accuracy or durability for a set amount of hits. Maybe another that could have a small chance to land a critical outside of vats.
---
Melee, could add poisons for damage over time, or 'strop' the blade to provide bleed damage for a set amount of hits.
---
Armor, have additional spikes or studs that would damage melee enemies for a set amount of hits,  or a stun pack that could add a chance to knock melee attackers back for a set amount of hits. 
---
Or an absorbent polymer mod that could add a 10% chance to add lead scrap to your inventory whenever you are shot.
---
Reflective plates that could reflect ranged damage back to the attacker.
---
I'm sure more will come to me but that's it off the top of my head. I would say that most of these mods like poison blades or the lesser gun oils could be simply crafted, then the more high end ones could be sold by raider/settler/brotherhood vendors.
---
it's a challenge
---
And yes, only if it’s a dirty one...(limerick) nice GT
---
I don't necessarily disagree, I'm just saying there are plenty of reasons why it is definitely possible that they are being completely honest (if not transparent) with it.
---
This kind of post has been made before. Don't do anything besides fix all the bugs, I don't care what others want. 
---
So has your reply. Which is often a set up for the typical response to degrade the person by degrading the person for liking such a bug filled game and insulting them.
---
I've been playing since launch. I've experienced the majority of bugs this game has. I've been reading this forum for almost as long. 
---
I have fun in the game with my friends. The bugs we've encountered, haven't stopped us from progressing through the game. My friend doesn't seem to know he's discovered Bogtown no matter how many times he's been. Same for me killing the SBQ. So we never got those Atoms. I don't even keep track of the number of times a legendary mob couldn't be looted, didn't have loot or whatever. 
---
It's funny how all the players claiming game breaking bugs, have still continued to play, progress and more. 
---
Am I genuinely happy with the game? Yes. And if you say anything against that, then you're just being a typical gamer that attacks anyone that is having fun at a game that you don't seem to be. And you are taking your frustrations out on strangers. 
---
I report bugs, I do my part, and the moment the game stops being fun, I'll stop playing. 
---
Chances are, you lack the capacity to accept that I and many others, acknowledge the bugs, work around them, and still have fun. There's a very high chance that your response will either attempt to be civil, or filled with insults. 
---
But I don't that you will be able to accept that me and many others just don't see things as bad as you do. I leave room for the possibility of being wrong. 
---
But based on your OP, and your response my experience with reddit tells me otherwise.
---
“6 months of zero content”
---
As a SWTOR player I find this amusing.
---
   https://gamesystemrequirements.com/game/fallout-76  this should help
---
Check your side quests as well. I noticed they don’t become “active” but when I switch to a new ally it says I have failed a quest for the previous one.
---
Since this is a planned rollout, and there's no way they are NOT launching the new content even if they "don't get enough resources"...
---
...is there anything I am missing by not bothering with this? Seems a hassle, my character doesn't know about it (is there some IG way to know? seriously... I wouldn't know if it wasn't for reading WEBSITES (even the menu-level news is sparse))???
---
From what I've read the rewards are so meh, why should I bother? I've got other quests to finish. :)
---
I usually am in first person but I like jumping so that might be my problem, I'll try third person
---

---
Bobbleheads are classed as a rare spawn so its not a 100% chance to spawn.
---
I have much better luck hopping public servers, because for every player that loaded the cell the bobble is located in  you get a chance for the bobble to spawn.
---
Whereas on a private, unless you got a couple friends helping, you only one roll per server refresh.
---
I'm not sure why, it just seems to work for me. The full method is: 
---
* Fully charge weapon to full
---
* Activate VATs the moment weapon is fully charged, and fire
---
It should what card do you have
---
As a person with uses only one character I know I do. There is so many other challenges I can think of besides leveling up every day. Hopefully daily / weekly challenges will be improved upon after The Legendary Run.
---
im on it
---
This!!
---
No quests in log and if I scrap ally, it says I failed quest.
---
I don't even bother placing them anymore as they talk too much and give nothing in return.
---
❤️❤️❤️
---
Yeah I guess you're right. I wonder what a "lifetime supply" of cork looks like?🤔 Different for everyone I suppose
---
Brotherhood really likes their bulletin boards.
---
Helps with the bureaucracy.
---
Well getting chainsaws at a higher level than 20 would be nice too in addition to the legendary versions thing ^^ I do hope they get some love at some point
---
Also they should re-add the ripper, buzz blade (I think it's out too not sure) and also The Dragon to the loot pool just as it was back with V94 only way to get any legendarys of those now is watoga highschool but that's only one stars and a horribly long grind for a small chance at a weapon
---
Yeah. Thanks. Deleted.
---
My PC without meeting the requirement runs it. If you can try running it.
---
I found 5 in less than an hour.
---
I was wearing it with the Vampire outfit too. But when I saw the new outfit I thought the same thing as OP. lol
---
What i used to do is get my level and then get 99% of the way threw a level the day before so i can get it instantly the next day
---
I’m just saying it wouldn’t make sense to not have one. Who would be playing the music you know? In a world where few are left behind it’s kinda odd for a station to play music constantly with no presence of someone controlling it. It just makes sense.
---
Check Aaronholt farm, 3 spawn within the location. Picked mine up first trip...I imagine it makes your odds better than server hopping locations for a single spawn.
---
Then it’s whatever b is for the ps. I’m just trying to help bro did you want me to look up your button map?
---
I have alot of Cork in my stash
---
I think you are talking about the circus cage trailer door
---
I think you meant  
---
How old you?
---
Sounds like the door that's part of the circus cage trailer plan.
---
Cos they put time and effort into that aspect
---
I love it too! Especially on Tuesday when all the new stuff and deals come out 😂
---
It’s a line from the Witcher 3
---
Hoarding 65 million golf balls for over a year has finally paid off
---
Ah, that would explain why I can't seem to find it. Thank you.
---
hah thx gang
---
Theremin :)
---
so not in shop anymore huh /
---
regards
---
J
---
Dude, chill. No need for you to get uppity. You can read and understand that it's an issue, and not simply me *somehow* not knowing how to press the back button. It's not help, its gaslighting, and un-needed :/
---
It’s from the circus trailer plan which is very rare and not obtainable at the moment. Came from the mole miner pails. You can still get it from another player but like I said it’s a rare plan. Alternatively, someone that knows the plan can build it for you. What system are you on?
---
I just wear a Civil War Top Hat with it. But The Black Cowboy Hat works well too.
---
Ahhh, never played it. Either way, dirty limericks are great. Lol.
---
I mean if you plan to make them exist then yes of course I’ll donate!
---
::level 23 shoots at you for two hours, doing no damage::

::wake up next day to 2554 notes all reading "H4X" and "DEEZ NUTZ"::
---
I have never used gun Fu and when adrenaline was broke I switched it out. Neither has made vats work properly. Even without them the vats bug still kicks in. Best solution, exit vats and re-enter it immediately. Then it works as it should.
---
Did you hold the button or just press it?
---
Sheepsquatch plushie made it all worth it for my wife and Me, to be honest. And thanks ! You have a good day, and good luck out there stranger!
---
Anthem started dead and has been updated to unrecognizable levels to turn a profit. If anything, it was an example of starting out cheap and pouring in large sums of cash to see a return.
---
The Valve game you’re referring to is called Artifact, Valve had planed multiple updates but had to drop the project completely because it didn’t make any money at all for them from the start,  not cause they just wanted to make profits. Valve is even putting more money into the project now in an attempt “reboot” the game, through a major in-game update, to see if they can make a return on the original game. Their intent was for the game to last for a long time, they just couldn’t get a return investment.
---
And if GTA V was so successful, yet is releasing their biggest dlc to date this year, I think it should speak to what works. It’s much cheaper to maintain a game with existing infrastructure and to keep improving it for an ongoing playerbase than to abandon the project after release and let it die. 
---
Fallout 76 is doing fine, most games are rn during the pandemic, the roadmap for the rest of this year shows they clearly aren’t just waiting for the game to die. Their tag line when selling the game to the public is that this project pile last a decade. You don’t trickle down in the gaming industry over a decade.
---
This is my plan also, I'm not getting involved with any of this nonsense. 
---
There's nothing in it for veteran players, 250 cork is worth more to me.sat doing nothing in my stash than gaining some useless plans I know already and alcohol I won't drink.
---
Can’t drop it unfortunately, though if your main levels Foundation rep to Neighborly you can buy the plans
---
Coalossal puns all around XD
---
Next week it will be in shop I believe
---
I have like 60 cork, I did want to donate but I just can't, I do have stockpiles for leather and cloth though when that comes around.
---
I also agree that this feels fishy considering cork is almost as bad to get as concrete, bethesda may have decided to add a zero to the donation amounts instead of removing it from the goal this time smh
---
Over 90% of players playing the game aren’t on Reddit and never see posts telling them not to do something.
---
I run it on a core2quad, 8gigs of ram, and a 1660 GeForce video card.  Works fine.
---
In Watoga, found a 911 recording between a little girl and a protection about getting her cat out of a tree. Hilarious.
---
&gt;do you think that the game is at a good place
---
not quite
---
&gt;is it something that can be fun for new players
---
sure
---
If you didn't spoil much of the game on youtube or on streams you gonna have a blast for like 20-30 (or even more) hours. Later it will fade away a little and you will see for yourself how things going with this game. After that you either gonna leave this game or you will find something enjoyable in it (PVP, grind, CAMP building, etc).
---
I've really liked gunplay in Fallout 4 but there was not much enemies to kill (I played vanilla without mods). Here in F76 you will always find stuff to kill. Also I personally enjoy the grind. I fucking love that shit since Diablo 2 days. I leveled to level 470 just in 2 months because I killed like countless thousands of ghouls and supermutants... 👿
---
I've done multiple runs of Morgantown Airport today to see how much I could farm and I've got maybe 20 cork scraps from that. The enemies don't often have pipe weapons. Shotguns, hunting rifles, and 10mm pistols are more common.
---
A lower level who isn't running through one shotting everything, jumping servers isn't going to get much cork.
---
I don't think so bc I have a TSE flamer and no one crashes around me
---
I've seen them and there camps all over. Haven't seen them with the mothman, maybe that's what they were referring to. Just remember them saying something that eluded to a big cerimony of sorts at a specific time of night. Thought maybe others had seen a big gathering, or maybe a sacrifice of settlers or something....lol
---
Super Duper for even more guns.
---
Yea I guess I’ll have to do that. It seems like it will take a while though
---
Multiple Meat Piles / Ash Piles seem to be causing a lot of players problems at the moment.
---
I get very little lag with any of mine. I'm on a gen 1 PS4. Could be a dip in internet speed.
---
I see that now, and PC, but I was more wondering where the plan was found than was in need of it. I think I'll just wait for the event to come back.
---
Finally a lore reason to wear the NCR ranger uniform.
---
Well no shit ya negative nancy but its a good place to start.
---
I was hoping for this for the shooting targets, but was let down.would be so useful
---
I”m going to donate about 4K cork from my main that’s been stockpiled over the past few months on 1st from scrapping everything I find with scrapper, just to spite people like you.
---
Good point, i figure you should also definitely use the vape nozzle for the same reason.
---
I have had the old man in my camp for 2 days with no quests showing either
---
r/tworedditorsonecup
---
Patience...
---
Not really, I've just made a habit of picking them up everywhere I go, so that now I have a good supply of them.
---
Oh okay, thank you it works how you explained
---
Exit vats then re-enter vats when it misses constantly, then it works. The perks are not the problem. It will happen without ever using them. The problem is probably with vats itself. Like the shotgun glitch.
---
Huh? It took us 4 days for concrete. What are you talking about?
---
Yeh got mine with the long barrel on just realised it’s a bad mod for the weapon
---
RNG man
---
Works at my workshops
---
I thought that too, but jus thought it was weird how long the fella was going without reloading was nuts
---
Well, they wish some bucketheads would show up, maybe they'll get their wish.
---
Lol I find bobbleheads constantly ...never had an issue with this.
---
It's the low frequency subliminal messages within the music
---
buyatomsbuyatomsbuyatoms
---
Yep, some guy gave me one and i shot it once. I thought ut was amayzing but my like 4 year old playstation did not so its been sitting in my stash until i play on a private server. I dont wanna be that guy
---
Old man is bugged per patch notes
---
It's pretty easy, barely an inconvenience. I use my spare slot to create a new character and go straight to the overseer camp, build my weapon, armor and set up my camp; I then go to wayfarer to kill the guy and talk to the bar chick to finish the 1st part of the quest. Under 10 minutes andni level up.
---
i'll just stick to what i was doing. too much hassle. if i was struggling to kill things then maybe i'd be bothered but i'm not. Maybe one day beth will fix it properly.
---
I like dual wielding but I think being able to choose two different ones may be too strong (essentially 6 star legendary with two primarys, imagine a bloodied and vampire pistol being used together) so just having a perk which enables you to have your pistol twice would be nice (I know it does make less sense but I really think it would be a lot more balanced)
---
There’s a good post on here where someone broke down each addictive substance (mentats, alcohol, psycho, etc) and the small penalties from each. So for example if your perception is already low or you don’t want to reduce it, choose a chem that doesn’t penalize perception. A quick search should turn it up.
---
They should all be removed from the game.  It would do a few things, deter dupers, deter people purchasing duped items, fix most of the ruined spawns &amp; it would reduce lag.
---
It will be available tomorrow, August 13th.
---
I started playing a month ago and I am enjoying it.  I have played all the fallout games
---
Yeah they said they’re going to be having the event again at a later date. Not sure if that plan will make a comeback or not, but fingers crossed
---
Thanks I’ll try this again when it eventually happens again. I tried pressing every button on my controller, but nothing worked.
---
I didn't have as much as I figured I would have. I used to gather golfballs for the plastic, but I only had a little over 400. It's obvious, and expected that Bethesda is 'cooking the books' to make sure the goals are actually met. They always intended to give away the prizes, since it costs them next to nothing. They just want something to keep people occupied.
---
Whitesprings always has higher legendary spawns than west tek for me...
---
i didn't play it yet...
---
Ty
---
Nice.
---
I really hate the challenges that rely on RNG.
---
I thought that was just from the main quest?
---
Edit: they are found all over the place. You probably just picked them up without paying attention.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4yv87wiyzzymMG5VPuyLuE/atomic-shop-weekly-update-august-11-18
---
Tomorrow
---
You just need to one where to look.
---
I always have the perk on that finds them for you, they're great sellers in my shop.
---
and one for dragon's breath so that the firebreathers skin becomes funnier. Also flechettes because flechettes.
---
Will look into it I wanna go junkies just not sure what i wanna penalise
---
I just pissed myself laughing looking at your profile, I try to figure out someone's platform they play on and their general way they go about the game, just because I think it's important to try to understand the other's perspective.
---
Then I saw some posts about stealth boys and was thinking whatever platform you're on has a game mode I never even heard of.
---
Because obviously, if you play fallout SB can only mean one thing.
---
I showed my husband and while thinking you were off your rocker for playing a version of fallout that only exists to you, as he, through muffled laughter, could only manage "that abbreviation isn't exclusive to fallout, and that's not a fallout sub"
---
Sorry, I had to share that as my husband is finding it hard to control his laughter.. 
---
And a weird end to a weird analogy/conversation:  thank you for that totally unintended opportunity for us to genuinely laugh, he is currently deployed and it's been hard to share moments like that together, as they happen.
---
They fought a civil war against the coal companies with machine guns and airplanes involved. The region is more complex than you might think.
---
Yeah I want the jukebox from the tattoo shop with the Nukashine
---
I've notice the same with Charleston DMV. It's been my go-to xp farm for a while and since last update it seems legendaries are far more rare.
---
goes faster than you think
---
these are not usually accurate... especially after numerous updates..
---
This is my first time actually browsing the subreddit so I apologize if this is a daily occurrence.
---
Vats issue not related to perks. Many don't use those perks and it still happens. I have had characters that at a low level didn't even have those perks in my cards and it still happened.  Exit then re-enter vats and it will work again. Only functional work around I have to found in almost 900 hours of playing.
---
Allrightyyyyy then
---
If you go unarmed you can. I just have six free points that I juggle around between weapons or convenience. 3,1,1 is usually plenty for heavy weapon skills.
---
Thanks I didn’t realize they posted the rewards on the shop page.
---
I 0% agree. If I could, I'd actually -73% agree.
---
It can be really bad, especially if they’re being used in large numbers. If I see that at a Queen fight on Xbox I have to keep my distance or FPS plummets and I’ve even crashed.
---
Why not just delete them from your gallery? Go to photo gallery the hit x and you can delete them.
---
What the cork?! How the cork did that happen?!
---
its only good for people who used xp exploits to get to level 1800 lmao. its an asinine system.
---
Well no I understand that, but what kind of songs are blacklisted ones?
---
They adjusted the concrete number on the fly so this is not accurate.
---
Or make bobble heads spawn reliably, that'd be cool too
---
That's exactly what I wanted to hear!
---
Said this the last time someone mentioned music and I'll say it again. I dont think people understand how big of an absolute pain it is to get new and upkeep music for video games. Look at the recent issues Rockstar had with GTA IV.
---
This worked, my wife just ran into this bug last night.  
---
Just logged in right after seeing this post, joined a private server and was able to use the terminal with no issue.
---
And it’s 4000 gold buillion so probably about 4 weeks if I max out weekly and daily limits lol
---
And explain why
---
there was literally a hotfix and new content released YESTERDAY these goblins just like to hear themselves whine. the same people who bitch about the season being literally impossible to finish on purpose to "force you" to buy atoms are the same people who bitch about there never being new content. yes there are bugs. a lot of bugs. yes they're worth mentioning. yes many of them get fixed on a regular basis. no bethesda is not conspiring to make the game bad on purpose to force you to p2w.
---
I hit about 40 spots they are supposed to spawn in. I guess I’m just not getting the RNG gods to favor me. I’ll try sacrificing a brahmin this time.
---
Also only give the thing to the people who donated
---
It would depend on the penalty for dual wielding but with pistols small magazine sizes im not sure there would be any combos that would be that much more over powered than what are around now
---
Explosives can definitely use some love. Mini nukes and missiles are just instantly dropped by me. Not even remotely worth the weight or perk points to lower. I did recently get a 2* junkies +50% limb damage auto grenade launcher that seems to have the same magical effect as shotguns while using VATS. It does a pretty comparable amount of damage as well, being able to one shot max level mutants and ghouls, but the explosive damage drop off is pretty rough outside of dead centre. I'm planning on doing some playing around with it, but even if it is getting that magical effect in VATS, we shouldn't need that crutch to make weapons viable.
---
I’ve personally donated 63 million.
---
A lot of meat piles in one place is generally what causes a lot of lag. Take Line in the Sand for example. If a tent is placed right and all the scorched spawn in just a single spot, that’s where the lag is coming from. I doubt it would be because of legacies, otherwise normal explosive weapons like miniguns LMGs would also be causing that problem. Explosive effects on energy weapons are special, but explosive effects on high rate of fire weapons in general aren’t.
---
The old man never gives a daily. All the others do, at least for me.
---
The Golden Holotape with Dick Shale is pretty good. It's from a random encounter that spoofs Willy Wonka.
---
I’ll check it out. Thank you!
---
Woah now, Appalachia in 2103 is no place for commies
---
Both. The button doesn't respond. I found out by looking this problem up that it's a bug. People said it could be fixed, but that's the part I couldn't find. I tried everything I could but the big basicly bricks half the controller so only the home and select button does anything in game
---
Mostly the words.
---
You can wear the White Wolf Fedora while you wield it?
---
We're going to need new character slots so we can have low level alts to level up!
---
Most songs do not return because the owner doesn’t want them to. That’s why the wanderer isn’t in 76
---
Us, possibly. You, most assuredly.
---
But you know why.
---
regular team mates can. public team mates can't.
---
I have never heard this one. Going on the to get list.
---
Oh dang, sorry about that I had thought you were having the same issue I had with the ammo converter where you can’t back out. I misunderstood. I said the hold b thing because I only found that out a few days ago. Sorry again good luck
---
Welp it's my opinion and it's also facts, if you can't handle the language then grow up
---
My PS4 ID is xSnuffyx.  Love to help and make new friends.
---
I found 11 legendaries in like 4 hours of idle gameplay yesterday. Feel like Bethesda should make a fallout style jingle about RNG
---
Craft loads of them or get adopted by a high level who has already done so!
---
well just see what I mentioned, you could be healing yourself as a bloodied build making it essentially impossible to die even when not looking at health while still getting double damage to your other pistol just making your dmg output that much higher than any other weapon, similar things would essentially happen if you have any dmg indreasing effect with vampire and I doubt bethesda would be able to have the legendary effects differentiate with what pistol is shooting so even the specific legendary things like dmg against scorched and mutants for example might either stack or apply a boost for those enemy types for both held pistols, I really don't mind the double dps you could get with it, as that's less of a problem then potential legendary combinations but that might be because I have already seen that once in BL2 where unrestricted chooseable dual wielding single-handedly made a character extremely overpowered.
---
Eh he's more of a fragile douche that can't handle being corrected.
---
So don't play the game.
---
And while your not playing also don't bother posting.
---
Where would you suggest I poke my nose in?
---
What is your graphics card?
---
I've ended up sort of enjoying playing NW. I'm a full-blooded bush wookie. I've never won, but I get some enjoyment out of making it to the top 10 and then getting killed, at which point my killer discovers no loot on my body, because I am a BW. Or better yet, I inadvertently become a trap for them, and someone else swoops in and kills them.
---
NOOO LIMIT, TAKE OUT THE LIMIT SCRIPT
---
WE DONT WANT LIMITTTTTTT
---
I found mine at the random encounter location by South Mountain Lookout.
---
I don't care about NW at all. I just wish they'd fix all the random quests that don't work right.
---
I didn't say it was the the language.
---
Bethesda owe us that score boost for all the auto completes that are STILL HAPPENING!
---

Last night was a pretty dry series of farm loops for me too. Glad to know youve taken the bad rng off me.
---
Saw a non sbq 3\* bat for the first time in like two months.
---
One star exterminator tire iron. Because of course it was.
---
All rpgs are... do you remember th atrocious inventory management of skyrim? How about the Witcher 3?
---
The fuck its like you guys pick out 1 thing and act like its not an issue in any other game.
---
The Charleston and West Tek spawn rates seem to have dropped dramatically since Wastelanders.
---
Sorry I didn't check.
---
I meant graphics card man
---
It's a glitch that we even get them, they're supposed to be gold bullion exclusive, I'm glad I never bought them as they're worse than frag grenades!
---
Here's the easiest way to get one, with 8 possible locations across 5 spots.
---
Deathclaw Island: on the NW corner on top of the boat stop waiting area
---
Tyler County fairgrounds: (1) in the shed with the Halloween decorations on the table
---
(2) on the metal table qith the medical box across from the cap stash.  
---
Darling sisters lab: on top of the trailer marked with "Welkom"
---
Groves family cabin: inside the cabin aith the big green chest above the bunk beds on the wood beam
---
Aaronholt homestead: (1) inside the main house upstairs behind the bookcase
---
(2) in the single story house under the baby's crib
---
(3) outside the single story house in the corner on the ground next to the metal tables with wood piles and gas cans. Its basically where out from where the one under the babys crib would be, if that makes sense.
---
There you have it. If you can't find one there then server hop. Next best piece of advice would be to memorize everyday locations where bobbleheads would be. For instance you should be doing the clean mutagenetic waste daily and there is a bobble head in the far trailer at Willard corporate housing on the table near the pc.
---
It's worked so far
---
Are you asking us or telling us?
---
Took me a few hours to get like 50 😭😭
---
That comment that you make so much of is a standard NPC dialogue that's in game and it's referencing the Vault 79 adventure.
---
I took the perception option in the dialog and got her telling me about the cannibals downstairs, so hearing this mysterious third outcome makes me really appreciate this encounter even more!
---
Sometimes the notices don't show up. Only way to see what's happening is to check the map. 
---
Unless you've done that, in which case, shrug emoji.
---
Is vamp even particularly good on pistols?
---
The rest with different damage types could be an issue but its very much Bethesda's issue
---
I’m running a bloody heavy gunner build with absolutely no melee perks, but I keep a BSS power fist on me for when I don’t need to shoot stuff (or for shits and giggles). Either way... the power fist does a whopping 1600 damage without any melee cards for me.
---
maybe so but for someone who may not know allot about computers or requirements you would assume a PC that can run GTA V on high can play a game that runs on the same engine as skyrim.
---
And I’d like to see less of the repeated, clearly obviously never going to happen requests that come on this sub day after day after day. As I said seem a lot on this sub would be happier playing Minecraft. I believe there is a building sub for fo76. Clearly neither of us will get our way
---
I’d suggest skipping recipes and just get serums from other players on reddit or in-game when you need them. Recipes are more of a cap sink than a money-maker and their value has been dropped significantly by how easy they are to craft.
---
Just reporting back to say that those auto-completed challenges appear to have completed properly despite the graphical information to the contrary. Strangely, the SCORE progress bar appeared after I exited my PA after Radiation Rumble completed, and proceeded to add all the SCORE from the suspect challenges (which I did accomplish).
---
This was the most recent, happened with a legendary gun. 
---
https://youtu.be/E1k6L71Q-FE
---
This was the first time I recorded, lost a bunch of gold. 
---
https://youtu.be/cl6Rg5BzuOc
---
What are thoses?
---
&gt;Chasing after a novelty set of gear with the perfect rolls that's completely unnecessary for any build?
---
The fact you still think the issue is the items themselves, shows a severe lack of comprehension.
---
The issue isn't what am I grinding next, it's why is it such a huge grind to do simple things when it isn't such a grind in other similar games.  This is supposed to be a AAA Online game, but it operates like a mobile game, which is absurd.
---
If you still can't understand where I'm coming from, then we might as well part ways, the original post has been deleted, and tbh this seems to be devolving in to farting in the wind.
---
Peace.
---
It still poopoo.
---
Well as a building game I’m sure u could lobby the makers to have it implemented. At least in that game building requests would actually make some sense
---
They will pretty much have to top themselves with  every season now or they are going to lose a ton of players to burn out, including me.
---
And while you're at it stop commenting on my post, don't act like you don't experience the same problems, the difference between me and you is I'm not scared to call out Bethesda unlike you keeping it all yourself and having no spine to say something
---
It looks like you'll be okay.  But you might be cutting it close.
---
Yes please elaborate
---
Did know it was something i should have held on to lol
---
Honestly I’d love to know more about their development cycles, if they spent even a day a month on tech debt it feels like they’d make massive amounts of progress
---
ahh okay, ill have to keep grinding it out then, looks like ill have to start doing some Nuclear Winter, is it still full of hackers on PC? If there is another double score weekend im not getting off the game xD
---
Version 1: Bad 
---
Version 2: Terrible
---
Version 3: I think I'll go back to just ditching unused ammo.
---
Did you shower? like, in the past month or so?
---
If a defend event has more than 2 waves of enemies I don't even bother, it's not worth the frustration. They can have the workshop for all I care.
---
Is that with Class Freak as well? Because I think you forgot to account for Herd Mentality's -2 to all when not grouped.
---
Operation health for FO76
---
May I ask what level you are? Its a serious question and not a sarcastic one either.
---
Which guns don't work in VATS? It works completely fine for me but I only use my fixers and railway.
---
I'm pretty sure sarcastic is what they wanted out of this. It fits right in with their overall love affair with raiders and their obsession with trying to get players to kill each other.
---
i agree with plans, my next wish would be some sort of shared stash and if we could get a shared scrapbox
---
honestly i just want to be able to build camps on my other characters with the resources i have on my main
---
Thanks! I appreciate this. Even if I learn nothing.
---
It is because they employ people to do jobs other than bug fixes.  Content creators are steadily churning out work even if it isn't always the greatest.  Hats off to them really.  The problem is IMO there are far too few competent programmers working on fixing bugs.  It also seems that much of the actual programming work is outsourced, thus the long delays getting anything done/ lack of quick hotfixes except on major duping etc.
---
different special builds, camps and weapon loadouts
---
Why 1 shot the normals? People need those for XP as well
---
Everything looks small in the big display anyways. I wanted to put a rolling pin in my kitchen and it got lost in the middle of such a big thing. same with my swords. Is like "display the display" more than the weapons, and is so ugly!
---
When I noticed I wasn't seeing any events I stated checking the map every couple minutes definitely nothing popping up
---
Old man gave nothing for like two weeks, switched to raider punk, and gave me some good jobs, one of which I had to kill a wendigo who's walking around under water. Switched to the space lady, and no complaints yet.
---
Do you really want a BOS collectron? It will probably do plenty of collecting, just inside of your stash looking for technology it can steal from you.
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
Lucky bastard :(
---
How is it worse, i find this much better than it was.  Only thing is having to hold the exit button to get out of it
---
That dood is a bullet sponge from hell. The one I ran into kept spawning lvl75 Wendingos that you'd have to fight off first before you could hit the big guy, it was nuts
---
Even unarmed bloodied won't kill the SBQ that fast.
---
Except other people.
---
Rhetorical question. Of course they made it worse.
---
First thing I thought when I saw it was this is just going to legitimise people one-shotting legendaries. They can go ahead and steal the legendary and then just throw up the emote and poof, all is forgiven.
---
Ah thanks, one mystery solved (:
---
lol... ok.  You get em tiger!
---
It covers the bottom half of your screen. :/
---
This has been my plan, I haven't even went to Atlas.
---
I was super disappointed after buying the plan for way too many caps and got a throwing weapon.
---
I don’t hate the game or myself :) just need a little break to focus on other things I enjoy like drawing etc. i will still be playing - just happy to be done with the grind and have time to chill for the rest of the event~
---
I mean at least before it only offered what you had available to convert. Now it feels like that part in chrono trigger where u exchange the Dino pieces for better equipment.
---
it took some getting used to, but the fact that I can buy and sell in bulk means it's a little better.
---
At Mononagh, they seem to eventually respawn near uranium deposit after some 5-ish mins, at least that's what happened to me twice, when the last rad dug in middle of transformers and only moved around underground.
---
Thanks for your contribution
---
Me too.
---
If you give me your IGN and I give you my IGN we can manually add each other. Then we’ll show online, but as mentioned, I’m +9.30 gmt so it might take a while.
---
IGN Jazdia
---
Then bulk it again and sell it. Why is plastic so damn hard to find tho?
---
When this happens just let it sit for a few minutes and it'll eventually let you respawn.
---
It's annoying bug which can happen during any event.
---
It’s a bullet sponge with a vaguely annoying mechanic that punishes melee players, but the design is pretty cool I guess.
---
Anytime
---
Yeah I hope so as well. I think that would also give people something extra to look forward to :)
---
They have plenty of people that can do that, they just decided not to pay anyone to make the changes yet.
---
Ooh I don’t know the state of the game on PC but yeah last I heard there were still hackers :(
---
I'm at 3s per frame on a PS4 Pro sometimes during radiation rumble. Seems to be caused by the ash piles from Teslas... These days I check how long it has been running and try to join at the last minute only...
---
I had 3 spawn for me at West Tek the other night,but prior too that,I had gone there like 3 different times,&amp; there wasn’t even 1 legendary on any of them runs...
---
I never have much luck at WS,although I hear it’s great.
---
As for the DMV,I only farm there when my one buddy gets on,cause he’s a friggin mad melee build,so I tag &amp; he bags...
---
It just works.
---
Otherwise I get overwhelmed,cause I got a decent build,but not enough to put down swarms on my lonesome.
---
Oh a hammock would be great!
---
No and Polly is gonna be pissed too. I just did this on my alt and choose the protectron body by mistake and she was not happy
---
Better question: why worry about it?
---
Because they're desperately trying to avoid news articles on low participation, and the possible conclusion that it may mean dismal player numbers. It's all fudge!
---
I think all the posts pushing for gathering weeks before atlas started helped a lot. I dont recall if there were any for concrete, at least not that i saw. When i first started reading it, i had 200 cork. I turned in 1k.
---
class freak 3 and i don't get a negative effect. game cannot do it. 75% of -2 is -0.5 and it cannot subtract half a point so it doesn't BUT it does save that minus half point until you get another - half point and then it will take a point off.
---
Fair enough, but, why offer the ability to trade in ammo you don't have? At least before you only were shown what u had available to get rid of.
---
do you have something better to discuss atm?  If not, GTFO
---
Beth probably put a multiplier on cork donated to make it easier, since they obviously want us to “complete” the objective
---
Just give up already, this game born dead.
---
Hammocks! Why didn’t I think of that?! 
---
https://youtu.be/xsbad8GEW78
---
I have been farming for just general xp there and I haven’t seen a legendary at west tek for weeks.
---
The settler is talking about the vault mission. The rest of them up in Foundation say that all the time
---
Meanwhile I joined for the same thing and then instantly run out of the safezone into the fire to die, went out to the kitchen and came back just to witness that someone actually came after me to kill me. Man can't even die in peace (:
---
This ui is exactly what I thought the interface was going to look like
---
Oh look. Another one of these post.
---
There are more golfers out there than you realized.
---
Its pretty understandable, you dont use cork for much so it just sits in your scrap or stash box, I had 200 concrete but I move my camp around a decent amount so it's understandable to not have much of that, but cork pretty much just sits there. I think it's used in some power armor, maybe not I'm not 100% sure
---
LOL they've added Covert Operative to Cork donations.  Sly.
---
It won’t affect anything long term though to my knowledge.  Just like most events/quests - no stays “mad” at you for doing negative things
---
Sounds like a hollow victory, winning a battle royal without battling. 
---
God I hate bushwookies
---
It really would be. They should have it in the dev room already so put a skin on it and put it in the atom shop. I'd buy it.
---
Dude, the whole brotherhood is gonna go down the tubes unless when can manage 64,950,987 more golf balls.
---
Probably true.
---
It just works
---
Go to Whitespring. I found one there first try this morning on my private server. In the bedroom that has the giddy up buttercup one spawns in there all the time. I'm not sure if it's the presidential cottage or the other house, but it's a regular spawn.
---
&gt;all it takes is looking at steam analytics to tell that this game is dependent on each update
---
Yes, but if there weren't so many (SO MANY!) bugs that interfere with the interface, game play, progression, basebuilding and combat,  many more people would hang around after they try the game.
---
As long as it stays in the crappy state it is in, they will lose the majority of new players shortly after the novelty wears off.  If the graphics and gameplay were at least decent, they would hang around longer.  This isn't rocket science!
---
In the Graphics department only ?? Or other parts need improvement as well ??
---
Surprising, another one of THOSE posts too.
---
I dunno, this kinda seems in the same league as calling the IT helpdesk because you deleted a file...
---
Yeesh, not me. For every bug they fix, they introduce two new ones. It would, literally, never be fixed.
---
Just fix the major issues and leave the rest.
---
I think the sad ones get to me. Not that they’re my “favorite” but they pull my heart- like the responder who locked herself in at the Morgantown Airport.
---
Oh... I already gave the info... second link. 
---
RX 550
---
Son of a bitch I'm pissed! I took about a year break from 76 and just played 3 NV and 4 and decided to come back and I was already not happy with alot of this crap.....BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO RELOAD OR SOMETHING COME ON MAN!
---
[https://i.imgur.com/LRiqlNV.png](https://i.imgur.com/LRiqlNV.png)
---
they are randomly in stock, if you are on pc i'll give it to you for free.
---
I found two today while running about with the perceptabobble perk. Even wrote one of my public teammates before picking up the second one to see if he needed it first.
---
Same with concrete. Guess Todd shared a lot of the cork that keeps him afloat.
---
That is very helpful and thank you for that. Real time testing would give many more options. How much are you hitting each limb for, free aim crits vs. vats crits, or even just general testing to make sure you are still getting the sneak damage numbers with no vats notification.
---
I guess he was just a clueless new player.
---
Had it happen to me for the first time today. Logged in about forty minutes after the update and they were all completed.
---
My opinion is they made bad, but in a different way. The overall functionality is better. I was able to convert some 3000 5.56mm ammo I had stowed for my handmade that I wanted to convert to 5mm for my explosive two-shot gating. But I don't want to make thousands of 5mm yet, so I can just store thousands of points.
---
Pianos are chairs also.
---
Who is currently on your blacklist list?
---
Also, am I the only one who has the game drop to 1-2 FPS the very first time I open up the weapon wheel in game? I have to wait a couple of minutes, then it acts normally... but if I open it up right away? Hoo boy, it's like watching a PowerPoint slideshow.
---
And that framerate drop with meat piles? DAAAAMN. Did the Radiation Rumble last night and I was getting maybe 15 FPS at one point. And I have a beefy machine.
---
You may need to join another server. Not sure if each event can only happen once per a server, but I’ve noticed the longer my game session lasts on a single map the fewer events that pop up. Events like powering up the power plant for instance need to last the life of the server, since it provide electricity to surrounding workshops
---
Don't worry about it, I come on this sub every couple of days (pretty much all I use reddit for), and I see the same posts all the time, I just ignore it, sometimes I click on them, like I did just now, I'll give you an honest review from your comments, I would say get it because you seem to like the open world rpg aspect, it has improved since day 1 dramatically, however, they constantly "fix" things - which end up breaking other things... this happens quite often (pretty much every patch), so just be aware of that and have fun, sounds like you would enjoy it.
---
They can't even get peoples daily score to work correctly and you expect them to do this? Hah!
---
I do, actually. 
---
Meat Week starts in 6 days!!!
---
Can you drop the outfit?
---
Any of the Tales from the West Virginia Hills.
---
Why would you turn them in if they're worth 12000 caps?  Bethesda isn't aiming that high...
---
Oh sorry I over looked it then but it should work a lot of the graphics from the last few years are essentially future proofing your PC so it should rn it somewhat ok you might see an fps drop here and there but you're good
---
I can agree with that 100%. When there are certain bugs or the likes it's just a flood of the same thing over and over. But I'd say that's more an issue of moderation. Sure people could search for the issues but what id like is a master bug pinned message. Any bugs reported that were in that list would be locked (but not deleted). Likewise there have been a number of repeated requested features. 
---
The issue isn't being sick of seeing the same thing it was the entitlement response. I don't think wanting a feature is entitled. There are plenty posts that are entitled this isn't it. Comments like that push legitimate conversation away and encourage more inflammation.
---
It's much better and faster to use, you just have to learn how to use it since it's just different
---
Both your GPU and cpu are on the ropes.  The gpu is worse off though.  Do you have any money to upgrade your pc?
---
Most people make second characters to make a different kind of camp, or to try a new build. A lot of us have been to every location a hundred times over, so the experience of re-exploring the map for caps and plans is more tedious than fun.
---
There's a PASSWORD?!? How long has this been a thing?
---
Or you could collect cork, bulk it, and... sell it at outrageous prices during the event. Here’s 
---
-Sell the bulk of 10 cork for 100 caps
---
-Donors need to buy 25 bulks to donate, so they spend 2500 caps.
---
-They donate, get back just 25 caps (net loss of 2475 caps or 99%).
---
-You could experiment with higher prices and test their limits (and potentially line your pockets).
---
Obviously it needs a lot of work, but the bulk option is an improvement.
---
The menu should show me how many ammo I have as I'm using it. Ammo that I don't have enough to sell shouldn't show up in the menu at all.
---
The one you find at glass caverns exit. Some woman turns scorched at the end of the tape.
---
I see no way this could be massively snd horrifically abused
---
Why do people care about meat week?  Is there something I'm missing?
---
I got one on literally my second try in one of my old spots ;)
---
Can they still be locked when they're blueprinted?
---
That would have stuffed his plan if it's possible to lock them.
---
I don't think team mates can take the resource when the owner Lock's them 🤔
---
I’d say the bloodied is best. Instigating is not worth it for a high rifle weapon. Limb damage is not that great either. But you may get the magic damage bug with the third one.
---
Theremin is atomic shop. You'll have to wait for it to come back. All others are usually bought from responders vendors. I tend to buy them in flatwoods at the church. There is a reponders robot that usually sells them. Also, musical instruments are under chairs to build.
---
I stopped playing right before the first meat week and came back for wastelanders, so am actually very excited for this. 
---
Do we get to COOK behemoths?!
---
An amazingly brilliant set of ideas that you started buddy.
---
Seems canon.
---
I'll buy that.
---
There’s tons of songs from that era that are public domain that wouldn’t cost them anything but the time spent putting them in.
---
Dont know, i used to walk out the power plant through the cooling towers after turning it back on and always hated getting hurt while doing so. I tried going the opposite direction and foung the general managers password or similar named and was able to walk out the front door. 
---
Now i can also walk in the front door anytime and never get a hack check.
---
Yeah it's free, isn't it?
---
Credit to intrepid359 for doing some great data mining of the guided meditation event.
---
Don’t think you’re wrong that they’d keep more people, but the game probably can’t function for 6 months without new major content. Even in its current state I’ve completed everything I wanted to. Only reason I’m still farming bullions is in case they add more to the shop. 
---
Even if the game was less buggy a lot of players that were able to keep up with content drops like me wouldn’t stick around until some true endgame repeatable content is released like a better vault raids system. Until they can solve the problem of gaming fatigue with their content I doubt they will focus a great deal of time solely towards game fixes.
---
Can you imagine playing this game for another 6 months, even if it had 0 bugs, in its current state? If the game is in trouble either way they might as well take the profitable direction.
---
Have you done it before? Do you like Grahm?
---
You can get that by server hopping at Phoenix in Watoga. It’s in his pool but not guaranteed
---
Bloodied is the meta build so that's an option.
---
If you don't mind burning ammo the Instigating one is both 'Magic' (does need to be tested as not all magic traits are functional for some reason) and then the high fire rate will help melt targets.
---
Just remember to share legendaries as normal.
---
This sounds like an intelligent reply. I admit that I don't have the best grasp of how companies like this function, at this scope, so thank you for the insight! 
---
In terms of debugging--sigh. I have a feeling the devs themselves probably agree with the majority of our issues and complaints. Whether they can allocate--or are permitted to allocate--the time to fix these issues is unclear. There is little transparency in who makes the decisions on features and how/when they will be implemented. 
---
Usually, and this is coming from personal insight into how OTHER software companies works, someone has to champion a particular bug fix or redesign, and then free up their team's time to work on it. Sure, they can always hire more people, but then you enter into cost vs benefit. 
---
It's complicated, and I'm kind of tired of hearing gamers blame the developers for everything under the sun that upsets them in game. We can't really know who to be annoyed with---there is a distinctive lack of transparency.
---
New rewards and a free legendary every hour if it's like Faschnaut was. Plus events are fun when lots of people are doing them at the same time.
---
Yes let’s all ban together to do the exact opposite of what the event wants us to do to show em we are super cool!!!! It’s almost like a certain amount of you never made it further than your teenage rebellion years. Then again for all I know you probably literally haven’t.
---
Put a cork in it.
---
Also remove the daily level up one: 3 times a week is very doable, but once a day is unsustainable.
---
Yes, I know you can do so with a different character, but I shouldn’t to create, level up and delete a new character every few days to complete a challenge.
---
Oh hey, just like when you check out a player vendor at their camp &amp; see you've already learned the plan.
---
You can transfer your pics to a flashdrive on PS4. But, that only allows you to clear the game gallery and start over with out losing your pics.
---
Im not sure if it has to do with how long the server has been or how loaded up the server is, but some servers are just duds.
---
If I havent seen the pop up or a public event on the map for an hour ish, ill jump servers and it usually sorts the problem
---
Sorry, I was a bit loose with the wording.  The correct name for the lode baring tokens is "claim token".  I always end up dumping them after every event because they weigh 0.1lb each and the stuff you can trade them in for is garbage.
---
The overseer tokens are called "overseer tickets" you get from trading in duplicate perk cards in Nuclear Winter IIRC, and you can use them to buy perk cards you don't have yet.  So once you've got them all, they are 100% worthless.
---
Sent you a friend request.
---
So the fact that they all say starting soon despite them not even being confirmed yet isnt at all odd?  
---
&gt;Theres planning ahead then theres  
---
(August 20 - August 24)  
---
This weekend that is starting soon according to the calendar is unlocked by the event that is currently running now with no garuntee we finish these events.  
---
And we somehow completed the concrete donation?
---
Oh can we keep the radio host we have now, because I really want to hear her thoughts and comments on every song.
---
So where can ppl put their tents to ruin the event?
---
I can only spare the cloth from scrapping the Welcome mat that used to be on my doorstep.  😁
---
Public events every 15 minutes. Cookouts every hour. People joining together to slaughter animals and party with Grahm and Chally... 
---
I mean, YMMV, but I love that shit.
---
" I know the devs are required  to play "
---
But what we don't know is HOW they play.  I would bet a dollar that the dev accounts
---
1. Have no carry weight limit
---
2. Have no stash limit
---
3. Have infinite ammo
---
4. Don't get debuffed for food/water loss
---
And I'm sure the justification they invented for themselves is "We don't have time for all of that while we playtest!"  So, no.  Their game experience is radically different from actual players and they never have to deal with most of the bugs or the grindiness of the game.
---
I agree it would be great, but it should be a small quest line to craft one, then maybe add skins for it in the shop. Shouldn’t have to pay for every single qol feature, it can’t be hard to implement surely.
---
You don’t need to fix the machines after it tells you that you have the adequate uranium level, as long as you don’t let all four break
---
Pretty much all builds are viable. You'll have trouble soloing end game bosses but aside from that you're good.
---
Nah there's 3 levels of animals you hunt, every 15 minutes. gather their meat and then join a cookout at the top of every hour. it's a lot of fun.
---
I donated around 1k.  Cork although rare, is more farmable than concrete, plus it's rarely used in crafting.  I'm sure lots of FO1st players have a few k stashed.
---
Honestly, I'd love if the spent the time fixing the game and polishing it more. So much chugging makes playing long sessions really hard for me. There's no reason that 76 should run worse than every other open world game out there. Bethesda needs to spend the money, hire the people and upgrade/rewrite their engine to make it work efficiently for modern games and systems.
---
And while I'm at it, if they don't intend to remaster their older games, can they at least removed Games for Windows live from Fallout 3?
---
i mean you generally cant redo stuff in online games cuz its all saved server-side, so
---
As I showed in my edit, it's an outright lie. That quote was from an official Bethesda account.
---
I guess it's because I used to hunt them to resell and I know all the spawns but this challenge takes less time than the event challenge does.
---
Run it, yes, but not with everything on high. As long as you don't go over 1080p it will be OK. Don't exercise expect it to look amazing. I uses a ryzen 5 2600x, 16GB of ram and a GeForce 1070 and I run every thing on high or very high with 1080p with no problems, usually. I noticed that radiation rumble gets laggy, but I think that's the meat pile issue.
---
There is no forget. Nor forgive.
---
(smirks from the bush you just walked past 3 times)
---
I'll never diss free shit too hard. I don't use it, only because the newest one doesn't help me in terms of knowing what ammo I actually have to sell. I shouldn't need to check my inventory over and over.
---
My favorite is when the last MOB is stuck just outside of the event zone in a building or other spot you can't snipe them and have to leave the event to kill them, lose out on xp and rewards, just so the thing will finally end.
---
You better prepare for a new weekly crap you will be able to buy with atoms! WHo needs bugs fixed...pfft!
---
While I think it could quite possibly be fudged, there's multiple reasons why there'd be more donations for cork than concrete:
---
1.) It's MUCH easier to get. For all the people who are like 'I've never even HAD 250 cork in my Stash at one time!' there's people who pick up and scrap every single pipe weapon they come across, or pick up golf balls for plastic and get cork as a side effect. For 1st subscribers, that sort of stuff will just build up in their scrapbox.
---
2.) People probably just feel more comfortable donating their junk because with the knowledge Bethesda will adjust the numbers if a goal's too outlandish, donating tons of junk is less likely to be a waste.
---
3.) I imagine four days of double SCORE is *much* more widely-desired than a BoS decorative flag.
---
4.) Cork is useless for most players, who largely prefer weapons beyond the pipe class or armor mods that aren't ultra-light. Meanwhile, concrete's quite useful for people who like building.
---
Moreover, who cares? I'm assuming you're not donating your junk which means you get free shit with zero effort or loss on your part.
---
My god you're right!
---
I could be be wrong, but I thought I picked up that plan as a static spawn in the room where you turn in SB dna?
---
I use it after I kill someone and Rob them of junk 😂
---
I think this a big issue with camp defense as well, specifically they don’t prioritize attacking important parts of the base like generators, extractors or purifiers but always just seem to ram their heads into the nearest wall even though there are open entrances from which they could get into the base.
---
Maybe since the camp box itself is moveable while in the workshop mode, maybe changing the mob pathing to seek it out would be better, allowing for more immersive siege like camp and workshop battles.
---
The fixer doesnt need skins it's so good
---
every 15 minutes, if you join the hard hunt.
---
Thank you, the only reason i included the instigating one is because it was the only one i tested( need to craft more ammo)and it seemed oddly powerfull. I will test the bloodied for a few hours and then i ll decide.
---
Ahhh... Super clerar now. Thanks for the explanation.
---
It's heavily implied since they are the Boss at yhe Cranberry Prime Meat IIRC, but no behemoth steak unfortunately lol
---
You understand the sytem i introduced only allows you to randomly apply effects to items it is still basically a slot machine. Just instead of just being SS armor it would be every item.
---
Also part of the meta change is that 4 star legendaries would be the new standard and you couldn't really upgrade three stars to 4 stars without a 2nd tier legendary module that would only drop off 4 star bosses and would be rare.
---
I think removing item levels, and letting all weapons and armor be used in custom crafting would make the game a lot more fun for players who want to share gear and get some decent rolls on items. To balance this i would recommend they make it so it requires more legendary modules for each item you craft instead of just 1. Then multiple 2nd tier modules for 4 stars which you can only get 1 to drop per 4 star boss if it drops at all. Also they don't drop off SBQ or encrypted, only open world bosses.
---
This would still create a grind for high tier gear. Also if bethesda added way more effects that are worth using then it would still be pretty challenging to get the build that you want, more itemization of combat effects will balance the loot list out for crafting. Legendaries used to be harder to get at the beginning of the game, but now you get showered with them at every event.
---
You can see the leftovers of this mentality and balance from "monster mash" where you hand in Halloween candy and it's insanely expensive and you have to do the event a bunch of times to get any legendary that's worthwhile...and it's random.
---
In the end if they make 4 star legendary gear the new standard and make it hard to craft, and the crafting itself is only applying a random effect to items that are lower tier, then i don't think it will break the system. In fact you maybe dissapointed that a weapon may not get the effect you want and you have to start over to get the "perfect weapon".
---
Also i suggested things like mutagenic storms and stronger areas even in side nuke zones with these, with much harder open world 4 star bosses that roam around and require groups to take down. In the end it wouldn't be "Easy" esp after damage has been homogenized by the one wasteland update supposedly making combat harder for everyone.
---
Enemies will still have a min. level so you can't just wander in to high level areas, but you won't be completely outclassed either. That also means a lot more higher level enemies will spawn for high level players.
---
Make it so groups need to cooperate more but at the same time making it so you are never completely outclassed either.
---
MY ideas are all based around the idea that we are getting harder content, and there will be a new 4 star standard so everything below that will be even easier to get, since bethesda has done this already with gold bullion plans weapons/armor.
---
So in the end you are just extending the same system to the rest of the items in the game, you still have to "roll" to get the effects you want, the only leg up is to start with some effects that you actually want, then potentially get your pieced "ruined" by a bullshit random effect. The piece will still usable, but you will be unable to take effects off.
---
This will not break the game, just make endgame crafting more interesting.
---
They do need to add more effects and builds to the game, such as allowing synergy between weapons such as melee and guns. Like my quick slash idea that allows you to  use a 1 handed weapon to quick swipe instead of bashing with gun.
---
This will promote players to have multiple weapons as a standard, instead of just one really good one. It's the same idea with dual wielding to bring it to a level where it competes with top tier weapons such as bloody explosive automatics. You can make it so the offhand has reduced damage, or effects don't stack with right hand so it just overwrites each other.
---
There are plenty of ways to balance dual wielding. Also AP costs doubles based on the fact your shooting 2 weapons, and using twice the ammo, so something like dual wielding would actually be pretty balanced for the game considering the associated costs.
---
I think them making it so players can have multiple weapons equipped at once could fix a lot of issues people have not using a lot of lesser weapons in game at higher levels.
---
Also if you take into consideration you can have companions in battle now  as well and you need to ALSO equip them. So having more legendaries be used is a step in the right direction. IT's going to be hard to get the pieces you want anyways with increased itemization effects, everything balances itself in the end.
---
You are crafting more, but you are using more. You are also breaking down legendaries you don't use for a small chance at getting modules back, it's not even a high chance. Scrip is still important. People are still going to be grinding all the time for the right "effects" esp when more builds are added to the game.
---
I know that Pete Seeger and Arlo Guthrie were blacklisted musicians. There's also Burl Ives, and jazz musician Artie Shaw would be a good fit as well.
---
Shut up and take my money!!!
---
They would never ask for screws. They know everyone is eternally looking for them.
---
Sorry to disappoint you, but there are tons  of people willing to farm this stuff.    People were not turning in concrete because THERE WAS NO CONCRETE TO TURN IN.   I stated this repeatedly and people kept telling me "that's not the reason, people aren't doing this because the rewards suck."  Well the rewards haven't changed and we are getting this next phase done. Why is that?  Because people  are willing to farm the event if the material is there to be farmed.  With the concrete, ***there was barely any  concrete at all on the map.***     Cork isn't as difficult to find.
---
Then drop a nuke yourself
---
It's either dupers or Bethesda. We know it's shenanigans either way.
---
Ah yes I see, customer service team restoring characters
---
What’s the point of being so spiteful toward people who do the events?
---
sure you'll save us one your done being ripped apart, tied up in government bullshit, killed by your own betrayers and running out of ammunition FUCK THE NCR YOUR WHOLE GOVERNMENT WHACK
---
Out of 1.7k hours i got only 1k cork, anything killed  should drop a wider variety of materials.
---
Go drop one yourself where you feel like.
---
I don't understand your use of twink (does having a full set of meta gear make your characters gay somehow?), but I agree that low level toons should not have access to SS armor and magic gauss shotties.
---
I'm on PC as well and my main char who I'm good at is level 102.    
---
I send you a Friend request through Steam but I play through the BGS Launcher. My user is: DocB30tn. Feel free to send me a request through the game. I do have an alt that might be around level 20-30.     
---
If you have any questions I can answer non-spoiler-ish PM me. I made a LOT of mistakes during and after the BETA and had to delete my first character.
---
i just do the riding shotgun event. there's a guarenteed legendary in there, and you can trigger it yourself.
---
Eww...
---
With class freak you get -1 to stats instead of -2.
---
I feel like this is a scam, but NCR were my go to so I'll help donate to your cause of ammo making
---
No but that would be pretty cool if they added aging
---
I love Fallout. I’ve loved Fallout since the original isometric point and click terrifying hilarious adventure days. I will continue to love Fallout. 
---
I love adventuring with my friends. Mostly adventuring with my friends turns into talking to friends while we figure out what bug is keeping us from being able to place something in a camp.
---
I do not have the patience to continue dealing with this game’s brokenness. I’ve taken multiple months long breaks before, using Discord to keep up with friends. 
---
I’m not going to degrade anyone, I’ll just be baffled.  Playing 76 right now is like getting in your car to go to work every morning only to find out reverse doesn’t work, turning on the radio causes the back window to go down, and occasionally a wheel falls off. After 3 months of this you go to the mechanic and everything gets fixed but now turning on the car makes one headlight catch on fire and keyless entry causes the windshield wipers to spaz out. 
---
It’s a broken, incomplete, spaghetti coded mess of a game. Parts of the main quest don’t work. VATS doesn’t work. Significant perks have been disabled for long periods of time. There have been places in the game that you just die if you walk through them. If you’re happy with that, it’s fine. I just don’t understand how anyone could be.
---
They equipped the Legendary Perk card: "MEGA SUPER DUPER".  For every 1 cork donated, 10 gets stashed!
---
If it was possible to go a step further, I would love for Rose’s raider radio to be fleshed into a proper radio station.
---
They could also take a page from FO4’s NW and add raider-themed original songs, assuming licensing rights is the issue preventing adding new songs (or songs from previous games).
---
Yeah both of my guns seem to be breaking all the time as of recently, which rules and I love smdh
---
B2525 fixer gang. How am i going to get 150 000 caps worth of flux and legendary items? No idea!
---
I always use a lever rifle and haven't noticed anything different about it. Did you change the mods on it at all? Some of them can increase or reduce durability.
---
We talked about it in the previous post but in short you don’t use a tent but instead just stand in certain places to limit the spawning locations, for example by standing on top of the bridge meditation hub building.
---
Everyone already knows Fallout 76 was a dumpster fire on wheels but that broad generalization has nothing to do with what we're talking about in this thread.
---
You're making the claim that because you can't reliably and efficiently farm god-rolled hyper-specific end-game non-mandatory gear pieces locked behind bullion recipes, 'grinding in the game sucks' in a nutshell.
---
That's going to be a hard no for me.
---
I'd also argue that the moment you had those gear pieces the way you wanted them rolled, you'd be done playing the game.
---
All of the content is easily doable.
---
Any type of build is accessible.
---
You're chasing after novelty.  That's what you're doing.  Something that should be, and probably was, put into the game as something to keep players busy for a long period of time while Bethesda tried to catch up in content to keep players entertained otherwise, you're using as an example for why the game sucks. 
---
Most of the limitations in the game make sense to me.  Trading will go the way of the dinosaurs if we removed scrip limits.  As little value as most of the gear already has in the game, it'd be infinitely worse without scrip limits.
---
I don't think that's a rational request in light of the damage it'd further inflict on the game state so that a small percentage of players can strip away one of the only brass rings still remaining in their gameplay loop.
---
Fallout 76's effectively early access as far as I'm concerned and they're trying to refurbish the game with more content to make up for its ridiculously bad start.  It's impossible for them to keep up with long-term players' needs while working from behind.  They have to lean on RNG and time gates, at least for now ( hopefully not forever ), until they can populate the game with other activities to occupy peoples' time.
---
I still see WS get hit every week. Saw Morgantown a few days ago, and Charleston awhile back.
---
Hit up all the satellite stations, lots of fans and shit that give screws. I have more then I can use and sell lots in my vendor. If you’re on PS4 and in desperate need I can help ya out, I don’t have a first sub so I can’t store them all.
---
player.additem  0001fa9d 1000  
---
Of course there are limitations so we can't do too much at once or we'll get in trouble.
---
A ton of folk musicians were blacklisted actually. The neo-folk revival was a very political revival before blacklisting, and significantly lost its political bite afterwards.
---
Mine seems to be working fine. Do you have the gun crafting perk equipped?
---
Huh interesting
---
Find Pete Seeger and Arlo Guthrie. Folk singers who were blacklisted for singing against the Vietnam war and for pushing for workers unions. I believe Pete Seeger was also blacklisted for supporting MLK and the civil rights movement.
---
Depends on the feature. Wanting 9 different stash boxes to cover each item that can be stored because u down want to click a button is pretty entitled behaviour to me
---
Hopefully starting next week we will see launches in a different place.
---
For me at least, an almost guaranteed legendary spawn is fast travel to the glassed cavers, 1 of the scorchbeasts flying around is almost always legendary
---
Okay, so it wasn't just me.
---
We already have frozen enemies around WS but they die too quick 🤣
---
Good thing they also added the feature to change your gender and appearance at will lol
---
Nuke somewhere you want to nuke! Don’t rely on others....
---
No. It needs skins.
---
Until the talking animal is a deathclaw....
---
I played with gunsmith level 5, but with or without it didn't chsnged the breaking time. I'm noticing it now, in last weeks
---
Wait... the New CALIFORNIA republic? In West Virginia?
---
Oh I get it, I do. This is a pipe dream that I wish was easier to get done. It would just add something cool to the game I think.
---
My favorite is that they don't have weight or would have been dropped already
---
Where are these stats surfaced?
---
Like IRL, you can't redo any choices. Live with the consequences. She's a robot and even with a personality your char would die of old age as would his/her descendants before she forgave you.
---
My wife and I have had the same question. We've been playing since BETA, and over all, that quest line was the most entertaining and engaging of the entire game to date. When Wastelanders was announced, we were hoping more would be done with the Order, but it seems to be an afterthought now.
---
Don’t know what’s going on then, my character looks fine in NW but not in adventure mode
---
Don’t use the stealth suit. Shit breaks so fast it’s not even worth it. Armor with the chameleon perk is much better.
---
I changed a mod, but looking at the durability bar, it changed almost nothing to the total, even if it is the issue, it would be too much
---
Heres the teir 4 and 5 legendary effects
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Fallout_76_legendary_weapon_effects
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Fallout_76_legendary_armor_effects
---
Click list of effects and  scroll down
---
If they unlock these effects, i think the only viable way to implement them would be to let players augment/add them to their current 3* gear via crafting.
---
Lol, yea well played that must be really fun. 
---
It’s no wonder nw gets no attention.  Devs must think everyone’s happy to hide in a bush   In a Br. 
---
You have to come up with a cute lil name to make yourself feel better about sucking the fun out of a game.
---
We won't go quietly!
---
The Leg- ehh the Scorched can count on that!
---
[Actual Reference to the name.](https://images2.imgbox.com/68/00/DQtaSYMf_o.jpg)
---
If I recall correctly, your storage boxes in Skyrim and the Witcher 3 don't have a maximum capacity. Which is where most of my inventory problems come from.
---
Almost, but not exactly - probably splitting hairs tho - if Amazon can tell me before I put an item in my cart, so can 76.
---
Personally I'd like to hear it be a ghoul. Maybe a Chinese ghoul still trying to convert people to communism?
---
Its fixed.
---
Odd, must not be all guns then. Maybe they changed it so something like high dmg weeps break faster? I usually use a fixer no gunsmith for ranged and I last longer than rad rumble for sure
---
Lmao you're literally insane
---
It's cheap enough now that everything is less than $50.    
---
If you've never played 76, you're in for quite an experience. IMO, Fallout isn't mean to be played like this. BGS gets a lot of flak for it but not all games to to online and work out. ESO has done really well.    
---
Fallout......is somewhat grounded but also all over the place. There is a main questline and Wastelanders would be a big secondary one. I've had mixed feelings and even quit for at least 7 months. Enjoying something is subjective and the only way you're going to find out is to play it.    
---
As early as 76 in the Fallout timeline, not having NPCs in any area would make a lot of sense. No game will please everyone who's interested in it. What do you plan to play it on?
---
But why would that be useful after you’ve brought the weapon?  This allows u to check your damage before u buy it
---
Same.  Donated 1k and considering farming tomorrow.  I don't want double score, I'm at lvl 100.  I have all those plans in the provisions.  But it's something to do and everybody benefits from it.
---
Gotcha. I guess I'm so used to playing old school rpgs too so micromanagement is the name of the game sometimes.
---
Lol I hear ya, should be able to capture some enemies and tie em up in a shooting range, content and player testing
---
I park myself by the bridge hub for that event.  If I am solo, the ghouls only come there and leave all the other hubs alone.
---
Using handamades, i don't see problems, maube you're right. But i didn't see changes like this in patch notes, it should be mentioned because it has a huge impact in gameplay
---
wow are you bashing the game?
---
Thanks, I should be able to finish the run :) I am a solo player, hence why i bush wookie it BUT I do give it the ole college try each match. Came  in 2nd once and i don't totally bush it. If i see a chance to attack someone i do, i just mostly die :)
---
What do you think BGS should offer in lieu for players giving up their legacies? Bloodied or Junkies /FFR/25LVC weapon of choice for each legacy?
---
Or is this more a case of " you dont have one, so no one should have one?"
---
I mean I really really want a Maserati, and likely never will...still doesnt give me the right to demand everyone elses Maserati gets wrecked or taken away because I dont have one.
---
The BoS won’t get Vertibirds for another 138 years (the events of FO2). I expect the landing pad to be used exclusively by Vertibots &amp; other unmanned craft.
---
Food for thought: If the BoS already had Vertibirds, the incoming expeditionary force would have arrived to Appalachia in matter of hours.
---
For the same reasons, I would also rule out visiting distant areas during expeditions, therefore locations from FO3 are the most likely candidates, given how close Appalachia is to the Capital Wasteland.
---
Shit!how will i get back to my time?!
---
&gt;Mfw I discover fo76 makes a pointless loot sink
---
Oh no...
---
I did not think to use a vampire gaus minigun. Good idea lol.
---
Early game 76 is fun and worth a $20 price tag (levels 1-30) late game is for people who want to put time into a game. Because the progression slows down and becomes pretty endless feeling. It’s not new and exciting like the early game but if you stick with it you’ll definitely get +200 hours out of the game whether it’s satisfying or not. At least it’s something to play.
---
.............. Just remember that, if one day we see end game raid content, nobody becomes an elitist fuck and proclude others because their 'DPS parse' isn't high enough. Then again, with no aoe/dot stuff really being prevalent in this game it's kinda redundant other than what a per shot rating is which I guess OP is after. 
---
I remember in ESO seeing many a big dick DPS kid utterly fail when the dummy hit back in real life.
---
Personally I'd love a dummy... Not a sex dummy, not a damage dummy, but a clothing and armor *display dummy!*
---
I am a huge fan of the series and just started playing FO76 about a month and a half ago. I started with Fallout 3 the day it came out, and have played 3, NV, and F4 for a combine total of well over 20,000 hours.
---
This game is a joke where bugs are concerned. Any new items or building objects go straight to the atom store. A good majority of them feel like ripoffs from F4 game models, and even worse is the lack of fresh content. Ive payed monthly for games, and you cant expect people to keep playing if all you do is throw fluff out for resale while not adding anything story driven or enticing.
---
The queen and the wendigo in the mine are a start, but you need to stop funneling the money from tgis game to other projects. It shows that this is the case by the lack of new content. In all honesty, I wont waste money on fallout 1st unless there is CONTENT added MONTHLY.
---
Its not hard. It means firing worthless employees and hiring people that want to work. It means not paying outrageous salaries to people who shouldnt be employed. 
---
ESO is a good example of how content should be handled. As it stands, it seems like the devs lack resources and manpower because the bethesda execs dont care. Its painfully obvious that this is the case. Im on the verge of quitting this game already, and I love the concept and story. I hate the lack of anything to do, a serious lack of building objects, and how greedy the atom store is. It goes without stating that fresh content is required if you change a monthly rate and expect people to pay it.
---
Otherwise, you may as well call it a mixed bag service in which you get some points to choose between whatever crap thats cobble together each week, with little to no effort put into the game, its many many bugs, or adding new missions. And not repeatable crap.
---
More actual missions. In which you hired voice actors and actually provide the service you charge for monthly by adding fresh content. Not rehashed skins or bs gimmicks like the ammo converter.
---
Nothing at all
---
Took me about 30 minutes going down the list of known spawn locations. I hate it too.
---
It should run pretty good, i have a shitty pc with an Intel G4560, 8gb ram and a gt1030, textures on low, water on high, lightning in high, shadow quality ultra and shadow distance on medium, and i can run it at atleast 40/50+ fps, there are hiccups here and there but most of the time those are produced by the game's poorly optimized engine. Your specs are better than mine if that says anything
---
Why does this thing need to be placed on terrain???
---
I wanna put it on a roof pls! cause it looks super dumb, building a floor on top of it
---
Just wanted to welcome you to the game, mate, and wish you all the best in the Wasteland. The game is still rough around the edges/buggy in places, and unpolished in some others, but overall I love it for the Fallout experience. Have fun, and go easy. There is so much to do and early game exploration is some of the best content the game has to offer.
---
Thanks for more salt to shine my legacies with!
---
Appalachia is very well known for producing folk music, and has a rich history of making politically charged folk music.
---
I know that now. But thanks.
---
I just got that Captain Cosmos PA paint that's 84 I think.    
---
I didn't find any Bobbleheads today either.
---
"Leveling up isn't that difficult"😆....try telling that to my level 745.
---
Guess you could’ve found a new bug. I’ll ask a friend tonight if no one else finds this pattern. He runs a lever action too so at the least we’d know if it’s a repeatable problem
---
There are people STILL playing Fallout 4 which hasn't seen any new content in three years!
---
Exactly. I 100% agree.
---
Honestly I want a radio station full of post-war music. Nuka World Radio was a step in the right direction, but Redeye isn't much of a band.
---
I feel like post-war music would have to be upbeat to combat the depressing loneliness and nihilism, but it would have to build upon some kind of nostalgic familiarity of the jazz and swing from pre-war. Probably a lot of trumpets, since good string instruments are hard to come by and a lot of the other brass instruments would be too low for the sound we want. It would need to be something you can dance and move to, since sitting idle would be a problem in this new society, which would also need some lyrics grounded in making something new from this broken system.
---
It's ska. I want a radio station that plays ska.
---
 This is my regular daily route to look for Bobble Heads, and I "usually" find at least one or two, just from these spots, but sometimes more.
---
Sweetwater's place, next to Giant Teapot - second floor, on the floor beside toilet.
---
Red Rocket, next to Giant Teapot - On a shelf under far cash register (there is normally a 10mm pistol on that same shelf).
---
Shed behind Silva Homestead (with the Mr. Handy inside) - right next to computer terminal, on that table.
---
Silva Homestead - second floor, on the dresser/table to left when you enter the room.
---
Lewis &amp; Son's Farming Supply - Greenhouse, sitting next to the cash register.
---
Lewis &amp; Son's Farming Supply - Large building (garage?), first floor, sitting on top of the large engine block.
---
Lewis &amp; Son's Farming Supply - Second floor, sitting on top of a barrel.
---
I heard 1 ranger can take out a whole squad of fiends from a half mile away.
---
I believe certain mods also tend to degrade the weapon quicker than others as well
---
Some people has this issue, they replied in this post
---
Havnt played long but all they do is fk up game with every new patch. They fix quality of life things players do with camp, they dont ban dupers/hackers - cos its prolly biggest part of playerbase and they ignore all info what people are bringing them in written columns with item name and what it doesnt do or shouldnt do... They just dont give a sht cos all they are able to do, make new garbage for atoms!
---
Purveyor or Crater. Vaults have nothing.
---
Because it’s a lie.  Isn’t this close to an even pace with steel?  Give me a damn break.
---
Morgan Town is the new map, it used to only be Flatwoods.
---
And it’s not making Bethesda any real income either. Slap some mods down and let ppl go to town and any game can be pretty popular. They’re operating hundreds of servers, they need something to pay for those on top of all the people releasing new content.
---
I’ll be sure to wear my ranger armor. 15000 steel acceptable?
---
Sure thing dude, hey, where is your camp located for unrelated reasons
---
My first kill was because I was scared and I hid in a bush and they guy didn’t see me so I just started blastin haha
---
Sadly I dont think record labels will stop being absolute dicks anytime soon.
---
Nothing worse than being a mutant’s bitch, would be very sore
---
Not exactly... probably 12-16 months later I may go for a fresh new Build... But now I'm broke as a joke...
---
Just listen to the Spotify Folk protest songs playlist for now:
---
[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0iedld68T5Kg6UwRnlw8BU](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0iedld68T5Kg6UwRnlw8BU)
---
🤣🤣 trash can ska. All the instruments are scavenged or broken. Perfect
---
Hey, *I donated 250 cork myself!!!!*
---
Didn’t we have a big old war to get rid of the commies? :)
---
There is a pc addon that lets you make your own song list IIRC
---
Yes but it's been ages since it was released and there are a couple more that were datamines. And in every roadmap nuclear winter has been noticably absent.
---
I think the base plans (minus the helmet) were 4500. You will then want the buttressed plans that run another 1500. After that you will want the modifications for each piece, estimate another 500 per mod. If you’re going to match your arms and legs you’re looking at ~7500
---
I've never launched my own, and I've been reluctant to as I'd have to do it solo. Despite being level 95, I'd still consider myself a below average player. My build isn't super optimized, and my best gun is probably my 3star combat shotgun. 🤷‍♂️
---
LOL truth be told, I've been looking for cobalt flux for probably 2 weeks but none spawn at site prime, except maybe 1? So I'll server hop over and over... but nope, every single drop is site prime 😆🤦‍♂️
---
I just reached level 170, and I was 164 when the run started. It's very difficult to try to level up once per day. I would probably try if it was worth more on the run.
---
A little salty today?
---
No. Especially with streaming services and the small amount of money labels get from that. People just don't buy records like they used to.
---
That's a life saver.
---
I haven't played since it first came out. I love the game, but its still surprising to see how im still finding lots of game breaking glitches. I built my whole camp in a unique location with the future-tec skin. It seems like its been known for a bit that its bugged and it needs to get fixed so I can SELL!!!!!!!!!. I know I could blueprint it but it runs through a tunnel and took me quite a while to build so im not really keen on that.
---
If you,
---
Add a line break.
---
Its much easier to read.
---
Im on mobile too
---
You forget this is a marriage of maybe three different games. That were shawdily patched together to make a new game that was uber rushed through initial development, and is maintained by a handful of junior devs with no apparent prior industry experience and a former senior who’s likely a lead now also with no prior experience. All of which get no real direction in what to do so they continue to slapstick everything together. 
---
Top it all off there is no QA process it seems, and the rushed dev cycles they live on only allow for wearing blinders to the extent of making it do what it’s asked to do with no smoke or regression testing what so ever. 
---
While I love this game it is annoying to me to feel that icy idgaf attitude from Bethesda that makes it all about making as much money off of people in the post release of the game instead of providing quality experiences and or care for its customers. 
---
At this point the only way to fix anything is rewrite the entire game with clean maintainable code and that would cost more money then they will make in 5 years
---
But this is all just my opinion
---
Nuke atlas observatory
---
Anyone have a clue why some people drop in the upper left-hand corner of the map? Seems the only “location” that gets hit is WV Lumber Co. The couple of time I’ve seen it, I was preoccupied and never made it up there. I’m assuming it’s for the flux. Anywho, be safe people
---
Yeah, the one thats destroyed our economy.
---
Where are you nuking?
---
You mean the return button? I’m pressing it and it’s doing jack
---
My handmade definitely doesn't work in VATs for PvP and it's still barely working in PvE.
---
What exactly would they be Revolting against
---
Sorry more meant for checking that it’s a consistent bug with certain weapons or if it’s linked to certain players.
---
I remember when Operation Health began for Rainbow Six Siege, and resulted in a brief content drought. People lost their minds, but ultimately fixed a lot of the core issues with the game (at the time). So it's not unheard of for a developer to do this. But I think you're right, Bethesda would most likely not do this. 
---
But it's a nice dream, George. Just like the rabbits.
---
Oh nice! Thanks for that.
---
Can we get a clean looking toilet at least?  We finally got a clean sink, I want all clean utilities etc.  I can build a fusion reactor, I sure as hell can scrub a toilet.
---
Word. I really want a cranberry bog map to force people to build or trench fight in those wide open areas.
---
I do the same thing.  I can just stand in one spot for the entire event, and kill any ghouls that show up.
---
Or maybe people want this reward more then the random camp flag that was offered before
---
It's a much better reward at stake, thus more participation 
---
It's not that hard getting cork, I had like 6k in my scrap box before donating it:P
---
It only ran for 3 and we barely had a mil on the 1st day
---
I would probably stay away from buying th game right now than.
---
You need a solid space, so [return]
---
[Return]
---
Type
---
Yea I waited for about 5-8 minutes before I just closed the game
---
&gt; running around for hours to encounter one maybe 2 legendaries here and there

People say stuff like this and I get genuinely curious if they're exaggerating for the sake of argument or they really are truely unaware of West Tek, The Golf Club, The DMV, The Burrows, Fissure Prime, Hawks Refuge, Abandoned Bog Town, The Generals Steak House, The Sunnytops... Or events like Leader of the Pack, Uranium Fever, AWOL Armaments, One Violent Night, Horde Events,  Encryptid and others that I can't remember off the top of my head.
---
I didn’t do it. And won’t. Have fun in nw, I’m glad you like it. I don’t. And I’m just commenting on a thread discussing why people don’t like some of the new challenges. So, you know, go talk to someone who cares about your opinion. You don’t care about mine just like I don’t care about yours.
---
Ah, thank you. Let me give it a try.
---
Ok.. enjoy having less junk i gues
---
Yea I mean I dont think it's as bad as some guys (PA player) on this sub make it out to be, but it doesn't really make sense that a full bolstering ss armor set has higher dr/er than T-65 PA. And like I've said before I dont even use PA.
---
While I love the idea of 76 getting fixed, given how stale it is and time gated at the end game, 6months without refreshing new content would likely be the final nail in the coffin for many.
---
I’m the same I loot EVERYTHING and have at least a few k in all bar screws
---
Try reverting the mod and see if it changes anything. I put the Captain Cosmos paint on the legs and head on my X-01 armor and started taking increased radiation in nuke zones. Never under estimate stupid bugs like that.
---
I got the 3 I needed without doing that one.    
---
Archery, Swimming, and another one I can't remember.    
---
If you kill 76 Scorched with a Crossbow you get 80 Atoms as another Challenge. You'll need more than enough bolts for it.
---
It worked! Tysm
---
I had to abandon defending the Sunshine farm factory today because the final enemy spawned beneath the map.
---
One thing I don't get is why each wave also spawns in waves. It's like 10 enemies max, just spawn them all at once in each wave.
---
Look if there's one thing I know, it's that every few decades someone reinvents ska.
---
Gimme that fourth wave, baby.
---
We definitely NEED this, so we can just select all of the ammo at once, and convert it.
---
Feel better?
---
That's what it says. but it cannot take off 1 point because of the 75% reduction of class freak 3. the only way you lose a point is if you had a bit of a point lying around.
---
I am on the fence about this. While i agree that they need to prioritize in fixing their game, i know i would stop playing in those 6 months and it would take a lot of big, and good content like the Wastelanders update on top of that for me to get back into the game again. Because there is no endgame content as it is.. I'm already at the point that i am tired of the uninteresting grind. Whether that is the Legendary Run, or farming legendaries etc.
---
Camp building keeps being restricted, and unless i wanna spend a fortune on Atom store items, my base is gonna be kinda basic.
---
I was actually one of the people that came back with the Wastelanders update to see if it was worth playing again.
---
My problem is: I already gave them OVER A YEAR when I stopped playing to fix their game, and they havent. I was pretty frustrated experiencing the same old frustrations, and even new ones that come with some of the new updates. 
---
And lets be honest.. What do we expect when Fallout 4 had that big bug fixing mod that the modders had to make because Bethesda didn't care to fix their age old bugs themselves.
---
Like some others here said: they need to allocate more resources to both. Prioritize a sinking game before its too late. You don't want to be remembered as the studio that just lets games die out because you can't fix its issues.
---
Also i have not experienced most of those bugs OP listed (except Duffle Bag).
---
Which wouldn't happen if you actually played, tested, or fixed issues before releasing them. It's the same with the concrete Atlas event. If they have played this game more than a few hours (especially without Fallout 1st), you know the 150 mil was impossible.
---
And i got a whole list of my own when it comes to bugs, but this latest update actually broke my game more than it has been in a long time.
---
They need to change something. If they wont allocate the appropriate resources to do both, then at this point maybe the 6 months is sadly necessary.
---
You clearly don’t know shit about this game. Goodbye
---
You get xp while you play Nw that is awarded in adventure, but the leveling is separate and you have to go into adventure to receive the level and credit
---
I farm those spots! I don’t know what platform you play on, but people have either gotten to them before me or the spawns are broken as shit on Xbox.
---
You mean, like, Monongah Mine? OH, wait..
---
Same.
---
pumpkin house doesn't, not sure about camden park.
---
Any other event im fine with this one is just uncreative and a ploy for bethesda to purge us of some of our junk.
---

lost home
---
fast travel. check two spots. log out and in fi they're not there. rinse. repeat. it'll take maybe 30 seconds.
---
9-10k gold if you include under armor and jet pack
---
That blows... well thanks
---
Eh I think the game is just easy as heck. Even without being bloodied it’s pretty common to one shot a legendary mole miner.
---
Im right there with ya buddy
---
Yes, or at least it ture with ss armor
---
That awkward moment when you try to hop on the Bethesda hate train but just end up embarrassing yourself
---
It’s not that hard, take a load of stims a few radaway and 3 or 4 rad-x. The silo spawns a low number of enemies and then the more ppl that enter the silo, the more enemies spawn. Legit silo runs take about 20 minutes if that... once you get going you’re going to find it’s not that hard....
---
Have you never gotten a drop that wasn't what you usually use and wanted to see how it performed before deciding to scrip or sell? I have for sure.
---
Make it Whiskey and sold
---
Each one takes 60 out of 10.000 budget points, meaning it's around 0,5%.
---
I think it can still happen with low number of players.
---
Did one once where it was just me and one other player.
---
We both stood back to try and cover as much area as possible.
---
After one wave of ghouls they stopped coming.
---
We waited and waited, when there was 30secs left, we started exploring to find out what happened.
---
I found \~10 ghouls standing in one of the floating platforms, not moving.
---
When I shot one, it sprinted out.
---
Might be related, since there were a fair amount in a small area. Like the first respawn bugged, and blocked the rest.
---
Especially when the wooden board comes out....
---
The lack of mods for some handguns is pretty odd. The Single action revolver which I'd love to actually be useful, considering it's so cool looking, only has one type of receiver if you don't count the Prime version.
---
Do you still play?
---
They’re not. When the nuke “loads” it spawns there and then moves to the target area. You are just seeing it lag...
---
Yeah, but they can't sell you a patch, so it's not gonna happen.
---
Easy answer, do you use PA?
---
Np!
---
I died right before the queen died last night, spawned on the opposite side of the nuke zone, had to run ALL the way through the rad zone.
---
Make it without dying, and no queen body to be found, so I spend 10 ish mins hunting SB and her body justs randomly drops outta the air atleast 200 ft from where she actually died...
---
I was glad, but had I not wasted time there, I woulda missed out too.
---
Jetpack is the better choice. It has saved me from fall damage so much!
---
I noticed this too. Feel like I have to repair it way more often even with the gunsmith perk. Starting to run low on repair kits as it’s one of my main guns
---
hmm what mounted head plans for 500 lead
---
edit: and which system?
---
We had 4.65 mill on day 1. We needed 15m
---
How do you play at that resolution and aspect ratio? y play with a 3800 x 1080 monitor and have problems with ui location and mouse sensivity
---
Nice photos!!
---
I didn’t think about that. Seems like the more logical choice.
---
The queen is a whole complaint post in an of itself... I cannot recall how many times she has just not dropped anything
---
Soreplank redemption
---
OK that makes sense, kind of like when somebody loads directly in the middle of the map before moving to their last location
---
Like I said, they’re focusing on what makes them money. They release a big update and more people start playing again than the number who leave due to bugs. 
---
Those QoL patches that ruined bldg mechanics were very simple fixes. Just had to separate walls and doors. Obviously not defending it, but the dev team clearly know that, unless Bethesda starts giving them more staff, they only get to keep f76 running  if they release what makes the game profitable. 
---
More players looks better on paper than happy ones.
---
Sure bro, nuke my camp all day long, at least it'd be a change of scenery, something different 🤣
---
If that's true, that could have been reverting a code change, or at least they knew exactly what caused the big since it must have come with the previous patch. 
---
I do agree with your point, I just think they tend to fix the bugs they are causing with patches faster than they fix the overall design problems.
---
And untill they add Legendary PA don't waste your time on it
---
It's not a glitch, it's a feature. - Todd Howard since Fallout 3 came out.
---
Pretty much yes...
---
Just make a dummy character and lvl it when its become hard just dump it  and make new one
---
Just curious as I have the same set up as you, how many cores does fo76 use on your i9? Its just been using one core on mine and I was wondering if that was normal.
---
Well yeah. I use it round WS. But now I have links that tell me a value and a link which I shared telling me the damage of i was to alter my entire build. I’d rather Bethesda concentrated on fixing the bugs already in the game. Fixing the content they promise and fail to deliver. That kinda thing. Fudging the numbers on a completely failed community donation event seems to be their priority now
---
Thorn and Solar I believe is a no.  SS armor is a yes.
---
It would have to be a very recent, poorly documented change if they added that to loot pool.
---
yes it did the same to me lol
---
Faster to use, but it takes a few hours to find the exit option.
---
From time to time, really I just thought that the armor looked really cool 😬
---
Great point on the under-armor!
---
Forgot all about the jet pack, hasn’t been top on my list yet
---
I need more than one upvote, as that deserves more.
---
Your RAM is fine
---
Your CPU is fine though it might struggle some times
---
Your hard drive is fine
---
Only thing missing is your graphics card. You need AT LEAST 2GB. If you have less you mught be able to play but with the lowest graphics.
---
Edit: just saw you hace 4GB. That should be perfectly fine.
---
I mean, i would buy the jetpack, but i never use PA so......
---
Is that actually something that going to be added? That would be awesome.
---
And I mean you *gotta* have the jet pack
---
3 on the outside of Poseidon. 
---
1:Go up the catwalk on the right side of the building to the pipe bridge that connects to the two cooling towers. On the left most cooling tower you’ll find a skeleton, aid box and bobble. 
---
2: from the previous location cross the roof to the opposite side of the building. Follow the conveyor belt down to the second building. Hop over the pipes going to that cooling tower. You’ll find another skeleton with a cooler and chems and a bobble. 
---
3: head to the highest point on the main building. Pretty much follow any catwalk that goes up. You’ll find a red steamer trunk, minigun, ammobox and a bobble.
---
I find that if it's in the daily quests, than its a pain in the ass it find. Took me two hours and a couple of jumps to find an legendary, and a bobblehead with the perk active. Had no problems finding then in the ten minutes before they refreshed, had found three at the golf course in the time. But after...
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault-Tec_bobblehead#Locations
---
Focus on locations that have multiple spawn points.  This guide was helpful.
---
Thank you for that perspective. I feel like the jetpack will actually be of use and the armor is more of just “that looks cool, I think I want it”
---
I run high PER for my rifleman VATS build and passed the check to find out why they were acting to funny. I thought it was a cool interaction to come across while exploring.
---
Cool, thanks for the input! I'm just about to pull the trigger on Steam so we will see how it goes.
---
I think the other person didn't explain it well.
---
If you get enough XP in NW to level up, when you log back in to adventure mode, you will level up and get the challenge completion for it.
---
*However* the XP that you earn in NW does not count towards the repeatable weekly challenge, Gain 10k XP
---
I stopped playing yesterday. Not planning to give the game a second chance unless bugs get fixed. A LOT OF THEM! Especially the VATS one.
---
I like the game but having to deal with so many bugs is just not worth it to me. Even the replayability is dead for me because of all those builds I could be doing but that I can't because way too many weapons are broken.
---
🤔
---
"Behavioral reprogramming" in the basement of Van Lowe Taxidermy.  The ending really makes me laugh!  :)
---
One of the ultrawide mods on nexus and a change to the ini file. There are still some problems but it's not too bad. Will try to find the link for the mod and update you.
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/405
---
No, it’s an old term, basically your tough on the outside but soft on the inside, you have better gear than you should.
---
Now I know what I'm gonna do with their little bunker now.
---
I definitely agree on the "enjoying something is subjective" bit. I wasn't crazy about Fallout 4 at first and still have issues with the game but I play/played the hell out of it.
---
I'm gonna be playing on PC.
---
I don't think I would happen, it'll make PA too OP. The switch off is having legendary against more armor
---
If you already have a camp, just build a stairway to heaven and take the plunge 
---
Don't be lazy cmon man smh, get ur build face on
---
&gt; At least it’s something to play.
---
That's all I need right now, lol.
---
Probably the hacking
---
Maybe NCR and Enclave can coallaborate
---
Gonna be playing on PC!
---
The junk isn’t serving a purpose, so why not use it.  at least it’s being turned into caps beyond my 1400 for the day
---
Keep the instigating FFR. If it’s fire rate is at or above 200 or you can mod it with a different barrel to get 200 or above then it falls into the magic weapons category. Melts anything even SBQ. I have a executioners 33vats minigun that melts the queen on solo runs in under a minute.
---
I don’t mind 1st members having those perks over us, I just want to be able to sell and scrip all my objects and have a better system where I can sell a certain number of objects without them counting toward stash weight. Tired of waiting to sell A tier Miniguns
---
Bulk junk can be valuable and you don’t really need a lot of it to play the game regularly, but there’s nothing enjoyable about being forced to choose between losing free currency or having an overloaded stash box
---
Well on pc maybe, but on consoles I don’t see any instances of hacking
---
If their new content is so important, why do they release it all bugged out?
---
You could actually answer which is the best horses instead of shit posting if you know so much.  But I imagine there is a reason you have been dodging that question.
---
Hard pass
---
Boooo....
---
....
---
Nah if they're gonna add an account wide stash then it needs to be for all players.
---
It happens even when I do the event alone on my private server, so your theory about it only being caused by large spawn numbers may be incorrect.
---
Only a handful spawn, but most of the time if I stay hidden and right out front of the courtyard, the ghouls will hang back in their spawn and never even approach any of the speakers.
---
I usually AFK that event, I do dishes or play with my dog or whatever.
---
Ohhh really? Thanks! That actually helps a lot more
---
What, like when the vendor shows you you've already learned the plan while browsing, before you go to purchase it...?
---
Either that or everyone has already donated all their cork. I'm down to a hundred or less on all my characters now. I get their idea of the "more supplies with progression" idea but they really chose some silly choices for the huge amounts.
---
Theyre typically Foodbuild players who rely on vats and don't want to be forcefully made aware of how actually poor at the game they are.
---
Two Shot/Explosive/Anti Armor and Bloodied
---
U can choose to no put in junk. It’s not a big conspiracy to get all ur junk
---
Yes but using Ingram mansion guarantees the least amount of time in NW
---
Reddit tents to have an overwhelmingly higher percentage of pc players than console. So their hacker whineing (though valid) is over represenjted.(which isnt too crazy seeing as how half of all reddit traffic is still coming form PC's)
---
Their graphics lead you to believe that it is, its shown in the top image as being part of it.
---
Old one was better
---
Jet wasn't invented yet. It won't be invented for another 150 years or so.
---
Edit: it was invented by Myron, from Brahmin dung in fallout 2, around 2241
---
Interface bug, happens at more than encrypted.  Try various things like opening social pane etc. that usually gets you out of it.
---
ok lol
---
I'd think it would be more of a temp speed demon mutation. Faster speed, faster reload. Makes you more hungry.
---
Ok, i see the problem
---
Bethesda hasn’t implemented because it hasn’t been invented yet. Even if they did, the hardcore lore fans would be up in arms. Same thing has happened with super mutants, BoS, enclave armor, etc. even if it’s not technically a retcon a lot of people think Bethesda are to ready to deliver on fan service too often, another retcon wouldn’t go over well.
---
I feel that man. Welcome to Appalachia.
---
Wastelanders came out at the same time  the game was released on Steam, and completely changed the game . Not just a regular update.
---
Explosive works poorly against her. I’d say Bloody faster fire or junkies faster fire would be best.
---
A huge issue right now is the absurd amount of request to add items and features to the game when the issue is exactly that. 
---
They’re trying to hard to keep this game going. It’s great fans want things to be added but I feel as if Bethesda is nearly back into a corner every time an update is put out.
---
What about zealot’s?
---
Just dislike PVP,  after decades of single player games. Never found the need for it.  More of an explorer,   I like using my imagination to create a storyline. Maybe it's from a time when imagination was needed to entertain myself because of lack toys.
---
The Jacko light is an atom shop purchase, the unlit jackos are gotten from the halloween event, and are you talking about the neon sign and letters plan? I think the cheapest you can get it for is something like 8800 caps
---
Nah that was disproved since there is jet in sealed buildings in Big MT. In new Vegas
---
It seems Jet was prewar as well, Myron just discovered a way to reproduce it in the wasteland
---
There are many ways to get caps.    
---
Sell stuff. Bulk scrap you can always find more. Events and Daily's net caps.
---
Lol read any other post on here. Wastelanders had solved a lot of bugs, but even if they didn’t people still played it. Bugs don’t matter if people are still playing it. 
---
I’m not defending the action, that’s just how most, American and eastern especially, gaming businesses work. A big update that quadruples player activity for a couple months looks a lot better than a happy reddit community at half that size.
---
Well I think the new event “A Colossal Problem” will require a nuke, so you’ll see a new red circle all the time soon enough.
---
While having account wide stash would be a benefit you could always ask a friend to help you transfer stuff to a mule. Its something you could do without but if you had it would be *convenient.* Which is what fo1st should be, not an impossibly different advantage.
---
Given they dropped the requirement for concrete from 150mil to 15mil so it would be reached, seems unlikely they'd fudge it neo
---
And? I don’t think we should base our opinions of high special stats(and balance, for that matter) off of a build who’s stats become much higher than anything else in the game because of a single legendary effect. The game shouldn’t be as weighted as it is around bloodied.
---
I do also have some legendary pieces of armor that push it to 26, and I constantly run a building team, so ideally, I reach 30-31.
---
Ideally? 
---
Sentinal (Cav if melee) and a mix of -% reduction (troubleshooter, mutant slayer, hunter, ghoul slayer, exterminator for example)
---
It wont take much DR/ER on top of poly modded solar to get you close/over the point of diminishing returns for the resist stats.
---
Edit: this guy was comparing ss to solar, but he breaks down DR/ER vs -% enemy reduction https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hzfjmz/balance_for_high_health_vs_low_health/fzin6dl?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
I've got an AA/ffr and Furious/ffr and if you use either with any armor that has 15% while blocking it works as a "magic" weapon. Melt time.
---
Hey I'm a foodbuild and I play the shit out of NW 
---
Don't discriminate us PvP'ers based on our munchies
---
Does the halloween event come out yearly? Cause I missed it :(. Damn its 8800 caps? Also have you seen any red wallpaper in game?
---
If they spent the next 6 months fixing bugs/glitches/exploits i'm sure that patch would most likely add even more of them and not to mention the next content update would probably undue some of those fixes, if the past is anything to go on.
---
less
---
Yeah, aimed at one of those blood things, looked like hits registered, and suddenly he was behind me and ended me. Weird. Spawned back in and he had no damage.
---
Bloodied adds two and a half times more damage than zealots does.
---
Still gonna be more people interested in double score than a camp flag
---
With my pa, it didn't even register as me taking rads.
---
I think a lot of people feel it doesn’t match fallouts style, I think a raiders vs settlers type of deal would have felt more natural. 
---
I don’t mind it but I can’t stand the  bushwookies, they make the game less fun for everyone who actually want to fight. Plus the hacker situation is pretty rampant.
---
Ugh this is it! Man I want to use the private server I pay for to build up all the workshops but it becomes such a chore to get the defenses to work right it’s worthless.
---
Have you ever tried a zealots? Wondering how a zffr would do compared to either of those
---
Lmao ooooo spooky.
---
Thanks for a response that allows a conversation. 
---
Obviously I can't tell you to change how you see things. That would be stupid and wrong. All I can do is tell you why I'm happy.
---
I've gotten my money's worth from what I've spent on this game. That's the first factor for me. The level of bugs, and I agree there are a lot, hasn't put a dent in my fun. VATS doesn't work sometimes. It's not broken all the time, otherwise would never fill the crit meter. Yes, it's frustrating when you have 95% chance of hitting and you miss 7 times in a row. Logically that shouldn't happen with a 95% chance. Only according to my computer coders, and computer engineer friends, it's very normal to get streaks like that. When this happens, I just adjust my actions. I unvat, revat and keep try again. 
---
Yes, I've had perks that didn't work. I played around them until they did. I've never once found a place where I just insta die. And I do like going to all the edges of a game map, and finding everything I can. That's not to say they don't exist. I've never counted how many times I couldn't loot a mob, or a legendary mob. There's lots of other bugs I've encountered, but don't need that long of a list. 
---
I've completed both main quests. I understand that since the last patch, Carleton Mine isn't accessible. It will get fixed. Generally when quests have issues, those are the top, drop all hands get it fixed and sometimes there will be a hotfix. 
---
People often complain about the long load times. I'm on PS4. I recently upgraded my game with an new hard drive, that my computer engineer friend installed for me. My load times are so fast now. But you can't ever tell anyone that the problems they might have are on their end. 
---
There hasn't been a bug in game, I can't deal with, or work around. 
---
The second factor is this. Computers and applications will always, always have mistakes. They are man made and everything man made will always have mistakes, and mess up. I'm a professional illustrator that works digitally. The main software I use has been around for over 40 years. It still sometimes has issues, sometimes it crashes. 
---
I don't believe that the team working on FO76 doesn't care about the game. I do think they aren't as experienced as people on other games. For example, the SS plans for pocketed and deep pocketed being left out of the update. That feels like a rookie mistake, made by a team that lacks experience. 
---
I get upset over important things, and to me, a video game I play for entertainment won't be one of those things. 
---
If the game ever gets frustrating I can walk away. It's that simple for me.
---
All I did was place my camp thrice and then I disconnected
---
14x more?
---
I'm really disappointed he wasn't an option in Wastelanders.  It's shit he's not there.  And FFS, they could sell skins for him for different breeds in AS.
---
Honestly I wouldn't mind seeing a group along the lines of "West Virginian Rangers". They could utilize the Fallout 1st Ranger outfit with some of their members wearing the advanced and elite variants which have the added armor plating. I could see small encampments being set up around the Ranger towers in game with a small forward camp at the Ranger Camp and renovating one of the larger Dolly Sods cabins in the Mire into their home base. Maybe they could even have a "new" bunker be exposed that is situated under the Cabin accessed via a tunnel system. Could even add in a fun new NPC tied to them being a "Ranger" Mole Miner with one of those communication collars we saw from Wastelanders. He could be one of their scouts and be a bit "too" patriotic towards the cause, but well-meaning. Other uniforms could be altered Ranger Uniforms.
---
Hey Julie here... I try not to talk about myself
---
Cork is far easier to get than concrete also
---
There's an npc that has a seperate pool I think? Might be a spoiler though, for the astronaut's storyline.
---
Where are you shopping that most things cost 30k?
---
Right on
---
New items in the cash shop is new content for you? No wonder why they prefer filling the shop than making the game more enjoyable. Gotta feed them whales!
---
yes, it should just be a repeatable, not a daily
---
But is it toxic or just dirty?
---
The rubberband damage glitch has been horrible for me the last two days.
---
I generally don't mind quirky or glitchy things in most parts of the game - some are actually pretty funny.  But they really do need to fix in-battle problems.  In a video game, where action and battles are the point, it's really the only unforgivable thing -  they should have a handle on it by now.
---
Love the game still though.  And still taking a break from it for awhile after I hit 100 in the legendary race.
---
Well not anymore, I want a hammock too
---
From the looks of it yes. We should get the reward in a day or two I'd imagine.
---
I mean, who knows with the many fails bethesda had in their own lore.
---
I personally would have been really happy if the only content after wastelanders were just bug fixes and expanded raider/settler reputation stuff.   They just totally dropped all that to work on Score and BoS stuff instead.
---
Yep, same idea here, except for a hat I'm using a green hood, since it works quite well with the plague doctor mask. Only the blood eagle splatter on the back kinda bothers me, but I suppose it can be somewhat covered with a backpack in a pinch.
---
Pa is great... if you actually use it.
---
I'm more of a Jerry Jeff Walker guy.
---
😁
---
If your it takes 12 tries... I gotta say... you need to move your camp
---
I made about 60000 caps yesterday selling plans and junk
---
I'd honestly love it if I saw a wendigo colossus riding the scorched beast queen. Even if it was a bug.
---
It isn't the game mode that people bought fo76 for. I highly doubt anyone bought fo76 for the battle royal mode, particularly not those that bought it before NW came out.
---
Content is gated behind it. People would like the paint jobs and armours, but dont want to play for ages in a mode they didnt ask for and dont want.
---
Advancement in the legendary run is semi tied to playing a game mode they dont actually want to play.
---
By existing, it draws dev time away from the main game - any time spent squashing bugs in NW is time that could have been spent squashing bugs in adventure mode.
---
For those that DO even want to play a battle royal game, its not a very good one (much better examples on the market, some of which are f2p) and its often rife with blatent cheats. Kind of loses its fun when you die to a guy thats on the other side of the map who's firing into the air that just happens to kill every player
---
Yes. It’s not in the shop yet. Everyone needs to relax.
---
The only thing I would really like to be shared are camp plans. For everything else a shared stash would be better imo. I don't need my gold bullion plans on every character, but if I roll something one character can't use, I would like to give it to one that actually can.
---
I said it can't one hit a SB or SBQ and that I do have mutations.🤔🤔 Did you actually read my comment? lmao
---
My point was, you don't have to run one of the few OP builds like 90% of the fallout gaming population to have a good time. You shouldn't complain about people not running mutations because it doesn't benefit you. Everyone plays the game differently, at their own pace, exploring all their options.
---
agreed wouldn’t hurt to get some 60s songs in there
---
There are quite a few reasons:
---
* It's a hack on a hack (FO76 is hacked multiplayer FO4, NW is cramming Battle Royale into FO76)
---
* FO has never been good with guns (hence VATS in the first place) - so competing with other people using the clunky mechanisms that exist in FO can be frustrating
---
* Not everyone loads in at the same time - this is a huge one, especially when you see that you're starting off near someone else. A game like this just shouldn't do that
---
* The loading times are bad - especially with the fact that you get booted out to the main menu after every match. Battle Royale games should be quick to get into, since they can be very quick to die in.
---
* The system rewards surviving way more than kills, which can make for a somewhat boring experience (bush wookies)
---
* The card system is crazy - why do I have only 2 minutes to get my cards figured out? And why is my SPECIAL locked to my Adventure player?
---
* No way to non-vocally communicate with other players besides somewhat useless emotes. Apex Legends, for example, came out with the ping system to highlight enemies and items to your teammates which I feel like Fortnite copied in like a month.
---
* The list of Bethesda Bugs
---
* People now feeling they are 'forced' to play it to get through the Legendary Run. Especially before Bethesda started adding extra daily/weekly, many people were calculating that even doing literally every challenge every single day would barely get you to completion.
---
* Because of the above and other reasons there are just - so many better Battle Royale games out there, with most of them being free. Fortnite (I know, I know), Apex Legends, COD: Warzone, PUBG, etc.
---
I should say, I don't **hate** NW, but I also have no real interest in it, and have only played it to get some of the Legendary Run daily challenges.
---
Zealots adds 30% junkies adds 50% and bloodied up to 80%.
---
Are there legendary versions of these armors?
---
Could be considered a retcon or something.
---
FO4 had put Jet being shipped to vault 95.
---
Myron was also a liar, so his statements are suspect.
---
Wiki entry says that Myron just rediscovered it.
---
"You fuel! We will never coallaborate with you!"

The enclave, probably.

No songs from that era are public domain.

This is the problem when you use crappy AI to triage support requests
---
I think I just got this mod a few minutes ago.😂 But I don't know about the plan.
---
the jetpack is to marsupial as marsupial is to regular jumping.  once you try it, you can't go back!
---
Your application to work at bethesda has been approved. You start monday.
---
I would like just a bump from 800-&gt;1000
---
Yeah I don’t use it enough so that’s a good point
---
I've not had lag but I've stopped joining teams because I started to only crash when someone joins the server and their camp or survival tent is were my camp is.
---
In new Vegas many outsiders have been there so finding jet isn’t out of the question
---
bloodied stealth builds of certain varieties can't tank in many instances. I also only carry one gun, I have to estimate whether i'll one shot a legendary or not with it usually. If I think I might I'll melee it or wait for other folks to hit it. I also spam vats and fire so often that I accidentally 1 shot a legendary every now and again.
---
Not as many fails as people like to meme about honestly
---
They've treated the lore pretty respectfully in my opinion as someone whose player every fallout game save brotherhood of steel and tactics
---
I'm going to look into this.
---
why can't I display my bows???
---
Be snarky all you want. Clearly your camp is in a super popular spot.
---
I had about a thousand cork legit in my scrap box. It is never used for anything so it adds up lol
---
See, I use heavy guns, so the only reason I *leave* my pa is to craft stuff.
---
Can you imagine if we had ammo types like New Vegas did? Including incendiary rounds?? That would be so much fun.
---
Sorry you explained it way better, I was loading into Nw and went quick lol
---
It's basically garbage. Why can't I just input the amount of the type of ammo I want to convert and than get the points. Then when I want to buy, why can't I just select the amount I want to buy and pay for it. Some college boy has seriously over engineered this.
---
I believe it will come out this year and we all get to lag our way though the event again.
---
Clearly they already know where my camp is and shouldnt load me into a world where it cannot be placed. Im using the acid extractor by gauley mine.
---
easily
---
&gt; It's been done to me so many fucking times.
---
Ugh, the number of times I play all the way through Campfire Tales or One Violent Night, and the event completes instantly before I even *see* the legendary because some jerk 1-shots it.
---
Or even worse, I'll be playing Guided Meditation or Project Paradise, spot a legendary, and while I'm fumbling with the emote wheel to try and quickly get out a "come here" emote, it gets 1-shotted by someone else. So I miss out on the drop myself because I was trying to be nice. Well I'm not going to be nice any more.
---
Those are top notch tapes.
---
This would be excellent, honestly.
---
Also - I think having Raiders, Blood Eagles, Cultists and Settlers try to take your workshop would be interesting. With them, you wouldn’t just have to shoot. Instead, you have charisma/int options to make them leave, such as suggesting another location to claim, providing them scrap or giving it up but they pay you.
---
Or shoot. That’s still on the table.
---
YouTube
---
Did you know that you don’t see that mutation unless you’re in a group?
---
I know, its just funny when it happens. 
---
But its still hard to keep such a huge lore mistake free in a universe of what? 6 main games and ~3 spin offs, i dont blame them
---
It would be interesting, sure, but who would run it? The communists in the Deep?
---
Yes, it’s quite easy with some of the broken legacies you can have, or just a really good (normally) bloodied build/weapons.
---
The real issue is when you haven't seen a single event in the past 30 minutes, so you're just stood there twiddling your thumbs while you wait for mobs to respawn to farm for XP.
---
I need this one. Heading to the glassed cavern, right after I find a bobblehead.
---
Thanks to that, me a newer player is encouraged to level up my mule to actually be a useful character to buy more guns for scrip that are actually level 50. But it is kind of tedious.
---
If u on xbox, I will go with u and let u nuke whatever u want...
---
Also, I nuke players that have horrible prices in vendors
---
[The original counter strike has 15k players atm](https://steamcharts.com/app/10), which means that its around double the active fo76 players on steam. 1.6 came out in 2003. What is your point? Quality and mods are what made Fallout 3 and 4 successful and the same thing applies to Counter strike and other very old games with active multiplayer communities and Bethesda is doing their best in my opinion to not understand that.
---
Fallout 3/4 was a solo story driven experience tailored to you and was significantly more fulfilling to play in just about every way (in my opinion) whereas 76 has a significantly diluted version of just about everything those games had with some exceptions (like camp building which some would argue is missing a majority of available fo4 camp building assets) with significant time-gating thrown in. Imagine how many main story quests before Wastelanders were just holotape scavenger hunts like the order of mysteries for example which I actually really liked. My buddies who have long since given up on 76 were woefully unimpressed with the order of mysteries and just about everything else in 76 after seeing stuff like the Brotherhood blimp float in the beginning of Fallout 4 and any number of unique and exhilarating experiences like it. Using myself as an example, I have put 298 hours into fallout4 with mods and completed just about everything and haven't felt the pull for a replay in a while especially since 76. I have well over 900 hours into 76 on a single character. I am unique in that I stick around because I want 76 to succeed and LOVE IT and willingly (albeit frustratingly) look past the bugs and grind. I think personally that Bethesda is doing themselves and us a huge disservice by leveraging marketing and the atom shop to attract new players without attempting (or appearing to attempt) to address issues with retaining them with by releasing grindy, time gated, bug ridden content repeatedly. Wastelanders was a huge step in the right direction, but it almost feels like an entirely separate studio made Wastelanders than support the current game with how big the disparity in quality is.
---
IMO, it's best to do certain quests after 50.    
---
All Rise is an awesome 2HD hammer and best for a Melee character or a backup to save ammo usage.    
---
Most quests that net gear that are repeatable are good after 50.    
---
Concerning perks this is just my opinion on what you should get if you don't already.    
---
STR: Traveling Pharmacy. Good if you're support/medic role. Pack Rat - IMO you shouldn't pick up much junk and instead go on Junk runs while having this equipped. Strong Back.    
---
PER: Green Thumb. Great for Herbivore but also any level in making Soups which fill both the Food and Drink meters while taking up less weight and list space. If you don't have all of the Lockpick Perks get those.    
---
END: Aquaboy/Girl I know I have a lot of Radaway but it's annoying having to pop it when I can avoid it.    
---
INT: All Hacker perks if you don't have those. Fix It Good and Weapon Artisan maxed but only equipped when you need to repair something. Chemist for Chems.    
---
AGI: Thru-Hiker if you carry a lot of food. I'd at least take Rank 1. Home Defense is one I feel a lot ignore until much later in the game and higher levels. Ammosmith max rank for any ranged character.    
---
LUCK: Super Duper.    
---
I had a decent gear set but it wasn't unti lafter 70 that I got my current loadout over many levels. I have Last Bastion for chest armor and a level 25 Right arm 3 star but I haven't found anything to replace it that fits this char. I have obtained other pieces which have the same effects so that piece could almost anything on it.    
---
IMO, I would suggest focusing on getting your gear up or better gear while looking at Challenges to see which ones you want to do. If you don't have the Possum backpack go for it. You get a 30lbs one as a reward for becoming one but you can craft the max one immediately.
---
Have had very similar experiences as well, my instigated weapons seem fucked half the time. On multiple occasions my second hit on a now damaged enemy has dealt more damage than the first one on an enemy with full health.
---
People more technical than I can explain why this doesn’t work. It’s been discussed ad nauseous on the sub. 
---
Anyway, you gotta move your camp. Sorry myerr
---
Sadly it will probably auto launch...which is BS
---
I mean...3 nukes on a SBQ already destroys the server...and now they wanna auto launch every 4 hrs....seriously
---
You really just gave Bethesda everything they would need to make it happen in the span of a week lol everything looks good and it doesn’t sound like it would be OP seems balanced and fair enough.
---
That’s exactly my point... Bethesda let up on regular bug fixes so they could make major gameplay updates. They’re focusing on releasing major gameplay at the cost of lots of bugs.
---
Before you try proving me wrong, let me just ask this. Is it more likely that the Bethesda devs are:
---
Being told they have an earnings quota they must meet for the game to keep receiving funding and are releasing the content they know will meet that quota 
---
-or-
---
Are sitting around their evil lair laughing maniacally wondering how they can piss off their player base AND bankrupt themselves. 
---
I think it’s fair to say if Bethesda has been taking this route for the past 2 years it’s because they know it’s making them more money.
---
Ain't spooky dude, it's a video game, you gonna have video game opinions you gonna get your video game ass kicked.
---
Silo really isn't hard, it's just a slog. As long as you have stimpaks it's not a challenge. I did one at 50 when I was barely using any good perks.
---
The best bloodied build plus chems will destroy her in less than a few minutes
---
I actually had 500 cork to donate, unlike with the concrete challenge where I had like 23 concrete to my name lol 
---
I have 1st and also over 1200 hours in-game but concrete just isn't a priority for me, unlike cork, apparently hahaha
---
Does the Nuka girl helmet work ok as a replacement?
---
Agreed - same ties with Daily RNG based events - anything that promotes server hopping has to be an issue for Bethesda
---
Same happened to me but in free range. Herded the brahmin by myself all way to the end when 3 higher level players turn up a minute before the end and results in killing the sheepsquatch in probably about 3 seconds and didn’t let me tag 🙄
---
Ah that makes a lot more sense now, thanks for letting me know :)
---
Posiedon energy is a fucking nightmare to defend. I once found super mutants inside one of the big chimney things and ghouls on the wrong side of the building.
---
Can you please link me to them? I want to follow them!
---
I doubt that since you get cork from scrapping pipe weapons which also don’t require cork to craft.
---
Hey man do you have some ultra 50cal ammo?
---
I always thought they needed to add a Fourth Wall radio station to host all the fan made songs, and songs that fit the themes but are not from the correct era for the game.
---
I’ve had it really bad to the point where I just end up closing the game and give up trying to do anything lol
---
Yeah true, plus since a lot of the lore is written of course by the in-game characters it gets muddy when you don't know how trustworthy you should view what they say
---
Myron tho, I wouldn't trust anything he said for a second haha, he's one of the slimiest scum in the series 
---
Either way, as long as the worldbuilding in each game is fun and makes you want to be a part of the world it presents to you, I believe they did their job 
---
Fallout 4's lore and writing was the only time I really felt let down, but the dlc saved it for me fortunately 
---
I just don't understand why people get so caught up with continuity like it ruins the game, at least not when it's something like when a drug was invented or rediscovered or whatever haha
---
Thank you for this! Also, fuck yeah, Free States!! 🤜💥🤛
---
Every version of the game is the wastelanders edition btw. 
---
Yes it’s worth it if you like fallout, particularly for exploring, questing, etc. 
---
Building is ok. It’s basically the same as FO4 with a limit on how big you can go. 
---
Storyline is ok but the lore and environmental storytelling are great. 
---
Leveling is easy enough. 
---
Survival mechanics aren’t bad. Eat and drink every once in awhile. 
---
There are some really good NPCs and dialogue is nice with wastelanders. It’s not an NPC heavy game though. 
---
If you don’t rush, the quests should keep you busy for about 100 hours. Then there is repeatable content and grind. 
---
I like it. I also have 900 hours in so I got my money’s worth a long time ago.
---
I mean, maybe on xbox youre used to shitty game design. Im sure there are modders that could fix the issue in a week lol.
---
Lmao exactly. "I try not to talk about myself, but heres the minute long, hourly description of who I am."
---
It's been done in 17 seconds
---
I dunno if Bethesda would reintroduce the idea of pre war jet. When Obsidian did it in New Vegas's 3rd DLC, no one cared about the retcon. When Fallout 4 had jet in health kits in abandoned buildings, people lost their shit about it. Don't even need the terminal mentioning shipping jet to vault 95, people were angry about it before it was widely known.
---
If I was Bethesda, I wouldn't add jet into Fallout 76 unless Obsidian wrote a reason for it to be there.
---
No outsiders entered the sealed facilities in Big Mt. after the bombs hit
---
They weren't opened til our character shows up, and there's still Jet in there
---
Life saver, thanks!
---
It’s not something that can be modded. Anyway just move your camp.
---
There are so many variables there is no clean answer. There is no best horse. 
---
It has been tested to death and the difference in speed between top speed and lowest speed horses is negligible. 
---
It then comes to health, stamina, and temperament. Truly any horse is viable with the hooded stirrups and Naco saddle, but you are still at a disadvantage using non top tier horses. 
---
All the top tier Role horses perform extremely well. Among the original horses the best imo were Turkoman, MFT, and Black Arabian. 
---
Of the horses added since launch the best imo are lvl 20 Kladruber, lvl 20 Criollo, (basically a reskinned MFT) lvl 20 Roadster, (technically “best” horse stats wise) and the new lvl 20 Gypsy Cob (extremely brave around predators)
---
The Red Arabian was the single most skittish horse I ever had in multiple playthroughs of the story, and owning at least 12 horses online.
---
fallout.bethesda.net/en/events
---
Fallout 4 still has bugs. What they need to be doing is investing in a new engine going forward not piling shit on top of shit.
---
I can say "if I get enough money on my check on Tuesday I'm going to spend it all on blackjack and hookers on Saturday" then me spending money on Saturday is dependent on the amount of my check I get on Tuesday. There is no guarantee that I'll get enough of Tuesday but I can still plan to have blackjack and hookers on Saturday. If I don't get enough on Tuesday then my plans for Saturday don't happen, if I do, they do. 
---
Same thing here if you replace money/paycheck with cork and blackjack and hookers with the double daily. They're saying "if you get enough cork by the 15th then you get double dailies on the 20th".
---
Is the first reward still able to claim
---
Any time anyone makes a logical response to anything here the trolls just always want to dismiss it as Bethesda shills or whales.
---
Look, you're going to have to get over atom shop it's been nearly two years, it will always be a part of the game. 
---
They implemented SCORE as a response to people saying they wanted to get more in game without ever having to spend money and immediately the complaints swapped to loss of Atoms and autonomy of choice. 
---
You will never get absolutely everything, how you want and when you want for free. That's an absurd stance to have. 
---
Even in their last interview during quakecon the developers stated clearly that 76 was the first dive into software as a service as opposed to traditional flat game with potential DLC as was Bethesda standard. 
---
Every game before this, you paid for DLC. Now with game pass, many players don't even need to pay for base game let alone the free atoms or SCORE rewards.
---
 There's players that never will spend a single dollar on the game ever, and a majority of the initial players likely haven't spent much more than just initial purchase price having refused to ever spend real world money on the shop - and that's fine. There's also players that will spend hundreds or more between 1st and shop purchases and that's also fine. 
---
That shouldn't be the focus of complaining at this stage because it's a stupid stance to have at this point because it absolutely will never be something that will ever change. If you don't like it, don't play. If you don't play, you don't belong on the boards complaining either. That simple. 
---
The reality of the problems here are a lot more complicated than most people are making it out to be and oversimplified or exaggerated responses to minor issues means that your voice is drowned out about large issues because it all sounds like the same petty whining from petulant teens.
---
Mine was i was sitting in a bush and someone came and sat next to me, they didn't see me and i had a shotgun... g'bye..
---
I hope Gramps is your stripper. I've seen more than enough of Sofia in her undies by now.
---
Wellllll, the thing with jet is a little tricky. Even in Fallout 2 it was implied that Myron didn’t actually invent it and was just bullshitting (haha funny joke) the Chosen One. And then in Fallout 4, jet was found inside a vault. So...you know. That was before the war and everything. 
---
Now why it isn’t in 76...I mean if it’s just and only a movement speed increase, then they probably won’t want to do that because of Speed Demon. I dunno. I don’t work there. It’d be cool if they add it, but I unno man.
---
I doubt we'll get that exact paint but the next season is called Armor Ace so there will probably be a bunch of armor customization stuff.
---
Lol, my wife and I like find the spawn points from which they tunnel. Then right as they tunnel back down do a quick VATS headshot and watch as they fly out the other side. It's pretty fun to watch.
---
Idk why I even try with support tickets. I must be a masochist.
---
It’s become a bit of a meme with my group where if she starts we all have to get up and take a break.
---
The top five effects are bloodied, junkies, furious, anti-armor and instigating.
---
Instigating isn't gonna do didly squat on the queen so you got the big four.
---
You'll get a lot of people telling you that explosive bullets are a waste, that faster fire rate is better. Well, they're not wrong. But I've got a junkies explosive lmg that does just fine. Plenty of queen killers still use them. Don't write off explody guns just because they aren't the absolute best fucking option.
---
Does that include a group of 1?
---
Awesome! Glad to see it works. Good luck :)
---
That is awesome of you. To double up on this, if OP is on PC, I will go through Beckette's questline to get a Final Word for you.
---
I like it but I hate being level 5 with no perks and getting wiped out by a level 100 with everything. My biggest complaint is just the setup. It'll take me almost 45 seconds to load in sometimes and other people are loaded in 10. Stuff like that is what really kills it for me.
---
That's my "go to" workshop to take. 3 acid, 1 gold, 1 crystal. If you see me there help yourselves, nothing is ever locked.
---
While I’d argue a dev overlooking minor details can’t be considered a retcon, I personally don’t care about changing fallout lore. I’m just saying why it wouldn’t be received well. Most people were down Bethesda’s throats about Taggerdy’s company before the game even released.
---
Things I’d love to see fixed:
---
***Broken challenges w/ atom rewards
---
The fast travel bug where it blacks out your screen
---
Double sided walls
---
Replace ultracite PA plan rewards with something useful 
---
A full health build that is as attractive (or even half) as bloodied
---
The ammo converter is arguably worse
---
Getting rid of trash perk cards and loadouts can’t come quick enough imo
---
The plan was part of a special event.
---
You only received the plan from the mole miner event.
---
I would be interested in hearing more examples.  :-)
---
Coming from War Thunder where this same idea has been proposed multiple times, the problem is not that cosmetic content happens in place of bug fixing. In fact with War Thunders case vehicle models are outsourced to another company, which may or may not be what BGS is doing as well.
---
Even if they are doing it themselves though its not like the coders and QA testers are making cosmetic content, or that the people who are making it can suddenly do their job.
---
Yep. If everything is perfect regarding the SBQs behavior too.
---
Yea what are you playing on ps4 Xbox 1 pc
---
Most Fallout fans are not PvP fans. That why Survival mode failed. Adding a battle royal during its hype with most of the fans hating PvP is the reason why.
---
PC also has the joys of modders, adding to the hate and killing a lot of entertainment most people can get form the mode.
---
Will you have BlackJack? And hookers?
---
Ok, I'll keep it in mind next time I play.
---
Fallout: Slenderman Origins
---
I think i would like NW if it ran okay but literally every time(about 6 times total) I’ve tried playing it it runs like I’m playing on a bad computer. Constant frame lag, server lag, textures glitching everywhere, my bullets firing sometimes up to 3 seconds after I pull the trigger. I just stopped trying after my 6th attempt I honestly don’t know how people put up with that crap. I’m on Xbox and adventure mode runs just fine aside from the usual bugginess of the game so idk what’s up with NW but I think I would like it, I’ve tried it, and it just doesn’t work for me for whatever reason🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I always enjoy finding workshops like this.
---
I keep buying it from the vendor and attaching that one weapon mod perk at max lvl cause maybe it works that way? No plan yet tho.-.
---
I think people are basically wanting how it was in Fallout 3, there was a variety of storage boxes in your house so you could organize your items. 
---
You could keep load outs in different lockers for example, run into your house and pick up what you need for whatever event is about to begin. Store all your rare outfits out of the way of your armor etc. 
---
Not having to scroll thru 20 bobbleheads on your display stand to get to a few stimpaks when you run low etc.
---
Fallout 76’s Spring 2021 Content would be perfect.
---
Project: Optimization - they could trigger seasonal events during that time to keep us busy while they try to fix a lot of the issues.
---
This is something we see  lot of and always like seeing new players join us. A few pieces of advice to get you started.
---
List your platform since FO76 is not xplay. I am PS4 and would be happy to join ya I have a newer char for those days when I'm tired of SBQ.
---
Once you hit lev 8(?) enable passive mode via settings!
---
Intelligence is the modifier for exp so rank it up early.
---
When you run into problems read here and Bethesda Community folks are great about sharing fixes.
---
Most important, have fun!
---
Still worth a good bit
---
You seen any red wallpapers?
---
Appalachia has many terrors...
---
I don't really agree with you on this, but that line was funny as fuck.  Upvotes for you for creativity and making me chortle.  A good day to you, sir.
---
Good pull my friend here to good ones for the future
---
"Auto"?
---
I got two Bloodied Fixers in a row one night and then got an Instigating Fat Man and a Junkies Fat Man and a Nocturnal Golf Club. 
---
Win some, lose some.
---
Would anyone want it you think?
---
Pipe pistol build time?
---
Don't knock them, pipe weapons can be super effective for a bloodied build
---
I agree! This is frustrating. I though maybe the auto setting was that. But don’t have a way to test it.
---
Or at least move the settings to the pipboy if that’s was possible.
---
I got a QE15 pipe yesterday. Just sad 😥  lol
---
Dude, I totally agree. That would be so much more simple. Just drop the ammo u don't have and then buy ammo with the points, simple.
---
I mean hey, I know you’re right. People *will* complain if it’s added to 76. Like when the ranger gear was added. For whatever reason people like to think that *only* LA had riot gear. And not other places that had riots and strikes. Like Charleston. It’d almost be like saying T-51 can only be on the west coast because Bethesda bad. I personally don’t even mind retcons if they’re either very minor or make sense and add deeper lore to something.
---
PREACH!!!    
---
I have 2 games I'm getting that can easily eat up the downtime. Marvel's Avengers and Cyberpunk 2077.    
---
Some of the side quests are glitched for me but I have finished Wastelanders and all but not having launched a Nuke for the main quest.
---
Lucky
---
Mine breaks like crazy since I added a hardened receiver
---
I barely last two workshop defenses
---
Sunnytop ski lanes has a easy to find spawn past the rocket launcher room, out through the hole in the wall and sitting on the metal crates.
---
Bethesda's giving us practice runs with the 10 screw daily yesterday :P
---
Cuz rngesus hates you 😁🤭😣
---
not for this game maybe because they use spaghetti code from 2001
---
Here is the trick for the hanging cabinet: hang the wall cabinet on the wall at the height you want. It will go in backwards and be on the exterior now. Go outside and place a shelf below the cabinet. Now blueprint the shelf and cabinet together. Now store them away and go back inside. Pull up the blueprint and the cabinet will now snap into place appropriately with the shelf being slightly off of the wall. Now just scrap the shelf.
---
It's not a good roll, is it?
---
My gaming laptop doesn’t meet the minimum requirements for it but I still run the game on decent settings with no problems :)
---
The beam splitter actually doesnt add much to the damage. It splits the damage evenly between 5 pellets, but each pellet does get its own explosion from the explosive effect, and the beam splitter increases the base damage of the gun by a bit.
---
Most of the bonus damage on those guns comes from the Nuclear Winter scopes attached to them
---
You figured out that a thing that is backwards is forwards from the other side?

Check out the big brain on Brett!

Yeah probably is it a two star or three
---
Not having something or intentionally nerfing oneself in a game creates more of a challenge.
---
If you were able to hook a target dummy up to your terminal and be able to change the stats on the dummy, that would be perfection. Want to see how your new weapon will do against the queen? A couple taps on the terminal and ta-da the dummy now has the stats of a queen and you can see how the weapon will do. I know that would be asking for a lot but it would be interesting to see how well shit tier weapons would do against stronger enemies.

I want to sell it.  I'm on pc
---
Well that’s a drag, but thanks. Does this apply to mods of the wet suit as well? Like protective or shielded?
---
I had to grind today for golf balls just to get enough for one deposit, yikes.
---
i also realize im asking for quality of life improvements from a company that cant even make enemies that arent invincible or frozen in place.
---
Thank you for a more in-depth explanation. I’m not defending Bethesda’s logic, but you can’t look at a game that isn’t making any money and say, “why don’t you just do that! It worked for them.” Even if everyone involved is made of sunshine and friendship, a (public server) online game is not going to maintain many of the principles that made past titles more enjoyable. 
---
Their focus is meeting quota’s on a game that should have been doing much better than it has more than making the community happy. At least for now.
---
I got a BE pipe revolver the other day.
---
Checking your camp location is like the 15,437 thing that occurs when loading a map.  Put another way, the map has to load before it can determine if there is a conflict at your camp's location.  Instead of complaining about something that is not going to change and out of our control, focus on what is in your control.   If you choose to keep this camp location, it's on you.
---
I haven't gotten the plan yet but I'm trying every chance it pops up:(
---
Do you know if placing multiple near eachother causes them to produce more rads per second? I might have a rad zone next to my showers for bloody builds if that's the case
---
Awesome, thanks.
---
Thanks I might actually use this build
---
No they are very rare, i only have the first two.

100% this. I really miss a few tunes from Fallout 4. I used to roam around the map in Fallout 4 with my radio on. I was addicted to the music in the game, from the intro score to the radio channels.
---
Theres a stripper pole???
---
There is one that has a list of different robots and then there's one that just has a qty.    
---
There's a guaranteed Assaultron in a few places including that fake Vault at Vault-Tec university. Arkos Pharma has at least 10 and I know that count was one.
---
I think explosive was only rollable on gauss shotguns for unintended explosive effects from her, though it does let you roll reload and fire rate bows, which are otherwise unobtainable as far as ive heard

I really would like a weekend where we don't have a limit on treasury notes I have like 250 sitting
---
Its for the "buy 3 items" daily challenge
---
Watoga medical center same. Used to get one every time but lately just a glowing wendigo
---
Daily challange buy/sell 3 things
---
Well dang I appreciate it thanks big dog.
---
There's 2 reasons why they reuse the same songs and can't add more unless they spend more money on music licensing.
---
One company they licensed from specified in digitizing old music. That company was bought out by another record company and pretty much dissolved them.
---
Another place they got music from was a government archive that unfortunately lost funding in recent years, so it's pretty much defunct now.
---
Instead, why don't we make our own faction? 
---
New Appalachian Republic Democracy. Or NARD for short.
---
Pipe pistols can be solid on the right build.  I use one made an auto rifle on all my commandos.
---
that makes A LOT of sense lol
---
I didn't have any desire to launch one myself, I waited until I was \~level 350. One weekend, I decided to do it myself, wasn't in any rush, took me about 45 minutes. Can't really explain the sensation/gratification I felt when I pressed the launch button.  Though, I may have launched 4-5 since first launch, no real desire to do the silo run.
---
Well that’s good news thank you.
---
I never said most things are priced 30k. But if you want to get an actually decent or good weapon you need that much
---
LOL, rhetorical and self explanatory are the easiest ways for people to comprehend. That calls for another bowl
---
They already give a bunch of new ones everyday, they can just replace level up with a workshop or any other random daily rather than level up everyday
---
They are only legendary.
---
Every combat rifle skin.
---
I would be happy if when they fixed something, it didn’t break three other unrelated things.....
---
Buy 3 times from a vendor daily.
---
I'll buy all your shotgun shells in 3 transactions, or 3 single random ammo if they're 1 cap each
---
Why fudged? First, cork can actually be cheesed via pipe gun crafting. And additionally, people surely want the reward so they try harder. Hell, someone may even dupe the cork to unlock the reward.
---
Sure, it may be fudged anyway, but it's not sure. I'll follow the Occam's razor and assume the numbers are legit.
---
I already do
---
I did one yesterday and got about 8 legendaries in 2 hours.
---
Thanks.  That worked for me.
---
Being killed by my own gun because the barrel of my gun decides it wants to bug out and go behind my own head is pretty epic.
---
Thank you, didn’t want to hang flags all over the place
---
Started the legendary run at lvl 312, currently at 378. Intelligence build
---
This right here. A B25 pipe pistol modded to auto can be great.
---
BGS needs to read these as well as do some sort of AMA.    
---
I got the Captain Cosmos PA at level 84 (I think) today. The only other thing I want is the crazy looking Raider gas mask at 92. After that I'm done.    
---
I did use some atoms to jump some levels but not many. I spent almost all of my earned atoms getting the new raider outfit and those spike barriers. I'd rather have those than some of the rewards we got.
---
Must have been really unlucky then. At least it still works.
---
The wrong kid dove headfirst into the woodchipper
---
Same here. Endgame has a bit of a sournote to it, but the quests and exploration are pretty good imo.
---
Almost as good as a nocturnal 2525 HM... lol
---
bruh idk why you’re so pressed over a suggestion...
---
yea 1 line in the sand event and i have to repair mine twice.
---
Are you on PC with mods installed?
---
I just edited it I forgot about that, Xbox I'm on xbox
---
The friends that I played with pointed out to me that they were spawned in long before me. I played with them for two weeks straight. I consistently spawned in 30-40 seconds after they would. We were in party chat on PlayStation the entire time. They'd be looting boxes and getting gear, kill a few players, all before I spawned in. I have a gigabit internet connection. Everything downloads fast for me. All works great except fo76 . From all the research I've put into the issue , it seems to be the region of the country I'm in . Much more rural than urban. The fastest internet here is still slow when compared nationally. So it's not worth my effort to try to continue playing it.
---

Am I the only person who just plays the game and doesn't experience all these bugs?
---

---
I'll craft some at my base real quick.
---
When you consider how old this series is, I’d be kinda insulted if there weren’t retcons. How many bs sounded cool in the 90’s that would be absolutely trash in a modern fps? 
---
I would I do think is Bethesda needs to start making more content that separates them from obsidians imagining. I live the BoS for instance but they can’t be an end all on creative factions. The raiders and settlers for instance. They couldn’t even give them a cool name! BoS, Chikdren of Atom, Enclave, NCR... they took amazing concepts and fleshed them out with important events and people. The (living) Appalachian factions mostly feel like generic concepts that were then built upon. They ended up being cool groups, but I should have felt like that the moment I heard about them.
---
I feel like any BE rifle is a super good roll. 3rd perk could make it exceptional. I would guaranteed have queen drops with it.
---
Laser weapons need a lot of upgrading.
---
I always wondered why when I would catch them right before they disappeared, they’d exit in a different location. I just always thought it had something to do with bloody mess destroying them
---
Just move your camp there are way more important things to be changed and fix
---
I use cork on all my armor I sell in my vendor: "Ultra light", to save stash space.
---
Thanks for the great tips, and on Xbox
---
I went to Ingram Mansion at night, the cultists summoned a mothman (killable).
---
The stuff that gives screws is everywhere and is recognizable - fans, typewriters, toy cars. After a while we could become trained to automatically spot and pick up those wherevere we are...
---
For me, I just do not like Battle Royale games at all.
---
I didn't manage to find one in my run earlier today but I'm not upset about it. It's called a daily "challenge", and I'm all for some challenges being potentially too challenging for me to do/bother with. IE: Not sure if I'm into the idea of everything being so brainlessly easy?
---
im at level 94 of the season and I cant wait to be done with this. Won't grind another season if it set up like this.
---
Yes, I just checked. I would recommend to get it today as idk when it goes away so play it safe.
---
From the bowl, it’s toxic. If it’s from the tank, it’s clean
---
Honestly I would be happy if they just added in New maps, it can't be too hard since they're already made locations from survival mode
---
A Nuclear Winter mode set in Watoga or The Mire is my dream rn lol
---
quest progress for instanced interiors only count for the team leader. everyone else is just along for the ride and xp. you can do both stories together
---
Yes! hammock party!
---
If they are copyright/royality/license free Bethesda might think about it.
---
Send me a PM with your in-game user and I'll help how I can.
---
I like where your head is at. What if we actually tested like a AAE pipe revolver and it was amazing? How high does the damage increase on different furious weapons? How well is this weapon going to work with my build?
---
“Power Armor glitch”
---
I don't have that outfit.  I tried the clean spacesuit helmet that came with the orange jumpsuit, but it just doesn't look right. It's a shame, too...pretty nice looking jumpsuit, especially with the Jangles Backpack and a jetpack.
---
Last night some friends and I were talking about the best companions in games. When I tried to make a top 5 companions list from any game I've ever played I ended up having 4 companions from Fallout 4. It's a real shame Fallout 76 doesn't have companions like Fallout 4 had, that's for sure. A huge missed opportunity IMHO.
---
Nah unfortunately not, its the same button action when drinking water but there's no animation. So you can do alot quick.
---
Sadly have no internet currently
---
I want new maps too but I think it's should be a lower priority than hackers, lag, bugs and balancing.
---
250 damage resistance while reloading, unfortunately
---
I always see very good 3* at prices under 10k, almost never over 15k
---
Because some ass hole with a infinite ammo, infinite fire rate, grenade launcher that doesn’t need to be reloaded has to ruin my day every damn day.
---
In before the trolls: grenade launcher go brrrrrrr
---
Wow I thought they were printing money but after the new patch I saw posts saying how bethesda are probably bleeding money from 76, I reckon judging from my own experience probably more than half the players are fo 1st patrons your numbers might even be an underestimation which is crazy to think of . You would think they'd reinvest faster though.  Make everyone happy and their wallets fat. 
---
Crazy really to think of.
---
Looks like they're halfway through turning into a wendigo. Keep an eye on them...
---
Thx, will keep it
---
Season 3 probably
---
Just wait till you see Line In The Sand
---
There were others before the courier showed up. Just look at the other dlcs
---
That’s an awesome roll for a stealth commando or guerrilla. It’s not god tier, but it’s much more effective than it has any business being.
---
I'm melee and looked like nothing registered and I was several hits behind reality. Never had that before update
---
My main mule is sitting on 31K cork.  Predominantly use PA so I don't think I've used hardly any ever.
---
They did jump on the Appalachian Thunderpipe quickly, so who knows. I guess they'll get to it whenever it comes up on their wheel of bugfixes.
---
My point was that the steam analytics aren't a reliable source to say updates caused a  x4 jump in users.
---
They probably package bug fixes with major updates because those updates go through more QA. And constant hot fixes just constantly break new things.
---
Not really arguing with you, just adding points to the discussion.
---
or at the very least use google before going to
---
 reddit
---
There was recently an atomic shop bundle of assorted colored wallpapers for like what, 500 atoms. I think there may have been red in it.
---
Now I just need someone to sell it to.
---
So I won't get auto completed like I did with "I am become death"?
---
It literally made me stop playing. I have a high level character but its not built for one shot kills and grinding. I have to really play to do quests and challenges so when people like that come along it puts me off.
---
Adding a Watoga map would be an explosive build's dream. Adding a more vertical map would be a huge mistake until they fix explosives.
---
I leave millions of rabbits around mine.
---
Floater grenades or no deal
---
They can stand in them, they just have to switch out to pacifist to claim them. Them standing in them cannot effect the claim status tho cuz that would be awful.
---
Honestly spec it out and try it.put a rifle stock on it and use the rifle perk cards.it can be hella overpowered...its ugly as fuuu but explosive pipe pistol is far from the worse.
---
Its seemed spotty since the patch that added the public teams. But I've never seen an explanation as to why or when events activate, so it might not be related. But you're definitely not the only person that's posted along those lines.
---
nope. pretty much all the meaningful quests in the Wastelanders questline are in instances, so things like choices and characters will only apply to the team leader. I Am Become Death was a pre-wastelanders quest, and nuke silos are non-instanced areas so that random players can show up and help each other, thus causing the quest to auto-complete if you have it active and a teammate launches a nuke. no worries with that regarding any Wastelanders quest.
---
It would be the same kind of warning that pops up when you are in pacifist and hit someone.
---
Something like, "You are in pacifist, you cannot claim this workshop."
---
If you say bad things about the game it effects your tops in game
---
I agree with you. My post was intended to reply to the user pointing out that Fallout4 still has players without updates and thus 76 must be doing okay in its current state. I feel it overlooks all the same problems you pointed out. I am curious though, why do you think 76 isn't profitable? The launch and initial sales were pretty low, but according to the quakecon stream and what little information we have internally about how 1st was perceived, it is apparently doing very well which to me indicates the issues are logistical and management and not monetary. It does feel like that in any case and not that the studio is not going broke.
---
It could be the people who duped the bobbleheads and then 1 hit the queen after stacking specific ones so their damage is like 1 million. Saw a post about a level 10k guy who did that, kept on one shorting the queen
---
I hope they do work on those things, but I would prefer if they prioritized maps and ways to give the game mode more variety, maybe some new NW exclusive perk cards and mutations 
---
I don't think the game mode will ever be really competitive or anything, so I don't mind if they focus on just adding more stuff to play with rather than worrying about balancing 
---
Just my two cents, not saying you're wrong either
---
If only
---
Ive heard that, with the exception of explosive legacy of course
---
I have no experience with laser pistols always have avoided them, so for plasma, so cant really offer suggestion on what should be changed.
---
Cranberry bog would be pretty sweet, with all the channels and sctuff running everywhere
---
As a melee person I like the new bug for this.
---
I already have a weapon I want to use though.
---
I dont know why you would tie and damage number to another gun let alone a rifle.  The gains of slug would be slightly enhanced distance, better shot placement, and stagger(or limb damage).  The recoil would be the same because the charge in the shell would be very similar.
---
Honestly that's where I would go with it. They found a trove of blacklisted holotapes at sugar Grove or something, and they want to continue to try and expand the influence of communism in Appalachia. Something like that..
---
Somebody sounds guuiiilty!
---
Facts.
---
I got a 3 star Vampire black powder rifle.  I felt like I was getting trolled.
---
i'd just have it give inginite AP for like 20 seconds or something.
---
I get about 15 feet forward, then jump back 10 feet. Not constant, but probably 20 times a minute off and on. Really frustrating when your overburdened and it still takes the AP from you. I JUST WANT TO GET TO A BENCH!
---
No, if only it were so simple to increase chance for a good roll.
---
It’s great if you have an explosive weapon, 4 lunchboxes, and spawn kill all of them. You get at least 3k xp per wave.
---
That’s too bad. So tired of spending 150 scrip to roll one piece of armor
---
myron is a scumbag and it is totally believable he copied a pre-war formula he found and claimed it was his own recipe.
---
Infinite?
---
Sorry, I’ve had multiple people get to intense today. Just assumed it was going to be an angry reddit kinda day. 
---
With small numbers, I agree with you. But at most we’ve seen a 2x difference with eso this past year. And nothing dramatic as far as a BGS game is concerned. When it’s such a large shift, I don’t think you can discount that the method is working. 
---
And I agree with your 2nd point. My comment wasn’t to say they fix nothing, as things were pretty okay post wastelanders, but people tend to not realize that small incremental changes do very little for player growth. Bethesda might have gone a bit too far with not fixing some bugs but most of them are only a big deal because we know things were better before they went wrong. 
---
Bethesda will lose people over a handful of bugs, the game will be dead if they stopped to fix every one of them without major content drops.
---
They can't join the server if your camp is there unless they're ok with it for some reason... Have you verified that cause for lag?
---
thank you very much.
---
yes. i made a typo, sorry. im only human.
---
And then queue posts saying "give the &lt;x feature&gt; to regular players and give FO1st players &lt;y feature&gt; instead!" for the next thing. And the next thing. And the next, ad nauseam.. 
---
It will never happen, because it will never be enough. People will always complain because they want more than they currently have at any given point without actually having to pay for it. People need to stop seeing this as a game for the players, and start seeing it as the business it is.
---
I would be happy with a tinkers...
---
got mine in 5mn... that was harder than if I found it in 3mn for sure ;)
---
It happened to me for the past two weeks, after the alleged fix. I made a ticket, waiting on a reply.
---
2200hrs in here, it’s been good from the beginning, just not a traditional fallout game. Don’t listen to the critics and just get it if you’re curious. Bethesda games will always have bugs and glitches, but the core gameplay is fun and will keep you playing for a while. I loved 4, NV, and 3, but this is hands down my favorite for its own reasons
---
No problem, i was just asking what you ment
---
&gt;I really enjoy blowing up strikebreaker robots
---
Why? They're the same as any other robots in the game but with a prefix attached.
---
Players like you are ruining the game for others.
---
It is pretty freaking simple. Put on pacifist, don't play Monster Mash, stay out of workshops. All of a sudden there is zero PvP in your Fallout gameplay. 
---
And honestly, you should probably just stick to a private server. 😐
---
Bethesda certainly thinks "auto" works that way -  [https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a\_id/44735/\~/how-do-i-mute-a-player-in-fallout-76%3F](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44735/~/how-do-i-mute-a-player-in-fallout-76%3F) 
---
My experience with it has been that "Auto" seems to be "if you're in a group, you get group chat, and  if you're alone, you get area chat". But maybe it has improved.
---
Zealots adds 30 percent.   Even Furious is higher at 45 percent.
---
Took two tries, but this worked on the second, thank you.
---
I just don't see the point of making a competitive game mode and not catering to the competitive players. If they fixed the issues I mentioned and marketed the game a bit, it would be a huge hit. The gun fights are actually really fun in this game.
---
Isn’t the problem the same no matter what. If you don’t take your loot from Meat/goo/ash piles  the server can’t clear them. Once the loot is cleared they disappear and the server removes them and it doesn’t have to track them anymore. Too many = higher processing.
---
I would pay to listen to mr new vega's voice caress my ears while playing.
---
I had a ticket open for over a week on a bugged quest that I needed them to reset, their auto reply was about challenges auto completing. Responded to the ticket like 5 times and each time it said "See response" with no response. Sometimes I wonder if they just do it to piss people off.
---
Daily Challenge...I usually buy 1+1 and then at least 100 of something I need...I feel less of DB that way...
---
Of course!
---
Actually reads the comments.
---
I'm toting around 8 right now, no problems so far.
---
Throw in a grenade and you have yourself one butt slapping heck of a deal
---
Oh no my internet points. Jump on the hate train? I'm just pointing out how much it is to buy the whole legendary run
---
It can be purchased from the vendor bots as bulk oil. Some workshops have an oil resource node that can be extracted from. Off the top of my head I think the Red Rocket Mega Stop is one. Silva Homestead has multiple items that scrap to oil and Ive seen a lot of oil containers in the Blackwater Mine when Ive gone there for Uranium Fever
---
Fair. Even more so if their mysterious boss shows up.
---
I'm melee and my first hit on an enemy does not register about 20% of the time, the damage numbers pop up though and get about 20 fps most of the time, sometimes lower. On PS4 Pro.
---
Yep I know, just trying to encourage OP
---
Solo or even just in a private world would be nice.  Dont even get me started on that annoying guitar playing thunder cunt...
---
I have FO1st and just dumped my entire cork pile from my stashbox... It was around 2k. I never used it and until this event I didn't even know what it was really used for. Maybe other people were also like that?
---
I hate it because it is a hacker's dream mode.
---
Example of game breaking bug?
---
it works even if you are in a team by yourself
---
You should also have empath as that also works if you're by yourself
---
I don't mind leveling up as a challenge even if they did it every other day, but doing it every day is absolutely miserable.  I get slightly depressed every day I log in and see it up there again.
---
If you’re a heavy guns build then yes it’s absolutely worth it in my opinion.
---
In my experience, NO.  But I’m sure others can give more detail. I had it. Made my character into a heavy gunner build. Hated it.
---
I mean, I run a group that will teach anyone interested on xbox what a meta build looks like. But we def don't tie into any lore. lol
---
I won the fucking lottery
---
Hahahahaha
---
So it's best to clear those piles as they accumulate instead if waiting till the end if your having FPS issues?
---
No I got it that you were agreeing! Just  adding on.
---
I think it’s profitable, but imagine the bar is set much higher, as this game isn’t just supposed to be another title for Bethesda but it’s supposed to financially support them the way gta online did rockstar.
---
Bethesda doesn’t have its own server farm, an expert online gaming team, and they don’t even have their devs that worked on the engine running this game. So I think when you consider all of BGS’s pic and console money is coming from one game rn, they can’t just turn a profit to prove this game a success. 
---
That’s why I doubt the devs have a lot of wiggle room to be working on deciding bugs which can take up a lot more time than concept work, building in-game elements, etc.
---
Even more, apparently the story boarder/script writer and actors are all just on retainer for this game which means if they aren’t developing new major quest lines they have a whole bunch of talented people doing nothing, and many will get paid either way. You don’t normally have a 3D artist take time off from his job to debug a wall glitch.
---
Unless you want to put in tons of hours leveling up in a mode that’s not much fun, you hide underwater and in a bush. That’s how it’s designed. More xp for time survived, less for actually killing people.
---
Start or join a public team, and you will benefit from the effects....doesn’t matter if anyone joins you!
---
Aiming isn't that hard.
---
Spawning in 20 seconds later than other players. They kill you the second you spawn and you literally don't get a chance to play the game.
---
Scrapping it for the plan only worked when it was an item people got out of the dev room. Now it's been properly added to the game.
---
And once you learn to fly across the map with it and a springboard (and the right setup), you’ll spend a lot of time just doing that for fun. Or at least I do daily
---
It took me a week to get 2k which i donated yesterday &amp; my other alt gave 1k. 
---
But i doubt that we will make 200m.
---
Baseballs gives 2 as well as any of the World Globes, you can get about 88 golf balls from Whitesprings it just isnt enough.
---
Be sure to fudge the numbers if we come up short
---
You should be able to get someone to build the sign in your camp if you are on a nonpublic team. I will be on in about 20 minutes if you would like me to try.
---
We must be on opposite servers, I ran it 1 time and got 6 legendaries...
---
Definitely workbenches too, at least 1. I could see Beth limiting it in some way because it shouldn't be a second camp, but tents need a bit more functionality.
---
It’s 2020 no excuse not to have someone within the team working on the game who genuinely enjoys playing the game that they work with and listen to. But there isn’t. The only direction is to salvage the cost of creating a gameplay interior you use only ONE TIME for a quest you are way too over leveled for.. All that man power goes to what? creating interiors or dressing the program that spawns generated landscapes so it all doesn’t look the same the other majority of the time. Bad leadership
---
As long as you are in a team you will get the bonuses. It doesnt matter where on the map your team mates are. Im pretty sure you dont even need team mates. I think it kicks in if you just start a team and no one joins. Either the description is inaccurate or misleading or its currently not working as intended.
---
I would also like some new jams, also a radio variety show or like the silver shroud radio station from 4
---
Well it’s to late to worry if it’s good or not if you’ve already bought it. 
---
I like mine, but it’ll never replace my other weapons. But that’s because it’s bloodied 25/25 and I’m not bloodied build.
---
Lucky hole has 2 nodes.
---
Having 15% block on your armor gives it a "magic" effect which is triggered in VATS with high hitrate weapons. (Or any of the other magic effects, but I have bloody explosive so I use the armor block)
---
It also looks like a lot fire than 5 (I'll try and count tonight).
---
I tried it with beam splitter and beam focuser, and beam splitter did a lot more damage versus scorch beasts, assuming VSTS 95%.
---
There's a lot of misinformation about legacy weapons, and I've had to do a lot of my own testing. (Like demolition expert not affecting the damage. It does. It's just not reflected in the weapon damage number, or the numbers that pop up. But creatures die a lot faster.)
---
It kind of annoys me that this game lies so much. The damage numbers you see in your inventory, and The numbers you see pop up are almost meaningless. The only thing that matters is how much life they lose server side.
---
All of this.  10000000%
---
It could potentially lose them money, so they'll fix it quick.
---
I kinda get what you feel with wanting to take a break. I finished the run Sunday night and haven’t logged on sense for the fact that I’ve got nothing to do at all. I mean I could do the queen but I’ve got everything I could get from her and it’s just a waist of ammunition and time, or I could do the imposter but people get personally attacked by the fact that I pretty much insta kill her. So for now on I’ll probably log on every Tuesday to just see the what’s in the shop.
---
As a NCR vet ranger captain, who is your commanding officer who approved this order.
---
Heya, sorry to bring up an old thread - I'm the developer of Mappalachia and the second release of the project is in late-stage development now.  
---
None of the things mentioned here happened to me, but I believe you're thinking of someone else - there was a "disturbance" regarding the developer of [map76.com](https://map76.com) where he was banned unfairly, and to counter the unfair treatment he temporarily took his site offline to get back at Bethesda. The site is since back online and I understand they were unbanned.
---
Why not just let under armour be equipped in power armour? It’s what all the BOS seem to wear in PA in previous games anyway.
---
Seems to be people who don’t like this idea. I think the best way to do it would be to give the option when creating a new character to share access to plans, caps, etc. or to start from scratch. Everybody wins.
---
Ah gotcha, thanks for the update!
---
I played one earlier today. The only time in my life ive played one. Id have liked to try and play the Star Trek theme.
---
Nice post, i will admit something clicked with me reading it. Your last paragraph is spot on too.  The game was built on shitty foundations, and certain things can't be reasonably fixed without reworking everything.
---
Thanks, I always appreciate reading something that changes my perspective lol.
---
I agree with you to a point, but we've had the same maps and perks for so long, even if the game mode was completely optimized, I'm getting to the point where I don't know how much longer I can play it til they add something to mix things up a bit
---
There’s also three at Wade Airport and two at the Beckley workshop iirc
---
Bloodied, Faster Fire Rate, Primed Receiver, Ultracite Gatling Laser.
---
Mine is called Death Star because it spits green death at anything in the crosshairs.
---
same with me with encrypted and just finished a SBQ run and got nothing no loot no reward
---
I had no idea, good to know👍👍
---
When’s you get it? Apparently a lot of ppl with high dmg range weapons are having them break fast
---
So there's unyielding thorn?
---
Yeah magic effects obv make them even more insane broken
---
I get higher numbers in inv and on hit with demo expert on for explosive effect guns so not sure what you mean there though, ive never noticed an issue with it. It increases the damage of the explosion by a bit, but overall thats not a huge increase (i think like 18% or something, maybe less?) for 5 perks
---
Splitter would do a lot more damage also tho ye, since it gets 4 more explosions of 20% damage , so thats close to like an  80% damage increase, and a bit higher base damage also. Non explosive guns it doesnt add a ton other than making them break fast, but explosive its really good
---
lol Food build is a player that runs around with QOL perk cards instead of damage output &amp; mitigation cards. 
---
It is also slightly reclaimed since the current PvP meta includes using food buffs. 
---
It's just a silly term all together.
---
Those are solid state drive players has nothing to do with Bethesda or the game some of my friends with the pricey ones load in 12s head of me
---
Beam splitter increases rate of decay on the gun.  Explosive too.
---
Depends on if Bethesda releases the same thing or has a new outfit in mind. They’re pretty good at pulling new outfits out of thin air.
---
I don't have anything against the atom shop or it's existence. It's the fact that you are calling whatever they add to it "new content" that is bothering me. I just don't understand why people are still happy to throw money at them for some fancy cosmetics while the game is still in a miserable state. 
---
I understand that a "free to play" online game ("" because fallout 1st is a thing) need a cash shop to be able to survive. Can the game survive if they keep piling up the bugs, though? I guess it can as long as there is people to buy their cosmetics on a weekly basis..
---
Here is my top 5 companions from "any" games: Liara T'Soni, Garrus Vakarian, Legion, EDI, Tali-Zorah
---
Second this.
---
I got it like 2 or 3 days ago
---
Lol back about a year ago when the game was still pretty new there was a fat duping glitch with display cases. And man lemme tell you by the end of that I got just about 1 million of every piece of junk and ammo. And don’t get me started on large presents before they nerfed them. Had about 100,000 of those. And I also just had about ever fixer in the game. because of all the script I got from the presents. Most of you are people that came from after wastelanders and never had to deal with any of this. I quit the game after a week of duping. Some people said they never did it, and I say they are liars. Once you see someone do it, the loot gets to you and you do it. I was never banned and had millions of everything and my scrap box was loaded. I personally think the game is in a better state then when it first started.
---
Also if you want to complain about a game that the devs don’t care about. Then just quit. The game will never be to fallout 4,3, or new Vegas standards
---
I think it has value. Sometimes I don't feel like lighting up an area with an automatic, but want respectable damage. The ammo cumsumption isn't bad, and it does hit hard and has good range.  I'm going to keep rolling for an instigating, or a junkies with ffr, figure that should be plenty for just putzing around doing dailies.
---
You can never be completely immune to stagger. Running adamantium skeleton and using strengthened limbs on your armor helps a lot tho.
---
&gt; Whereas on a private, unless you got a couple friends helping, you only one roll per server refresh.
---
this makes sense.  I spend 80% of my time on my private server, and I'm not sure I've ever found a bobblehead on it.  Very few magazines.
---
On the other hand, on public servers I occasionally find them.
---
The witch and skull halloween outfits can still be found. You should be able to find some outfits at jacks pumpkin house and on one of the wandering traders
---
Still though, its literally unusable, and I was happy with getting a quad one, can't even get through half a clip without it breaking
---
Movement speed and reload speed would be nice.  PsychoJet would be amazeballs!
---
i mean  **Halloween vampire costume**  sorry about that
---
I turned one into an automatic once and it bugged my whole game, like I couldn't equip any other weapons. I had to log out of the game and relog.
---
Great, I never get people to buy some types of junk like Cork, so it still served no purpose.
---
This is still an issue. I sent a bug report and after waiting three days they said that they’ve reset the quest for me even though i said it doesn’t seem to be an issue on my end. so i had to interrogate everyone and kill lev all over again just to find out that they haven’t fixed the door issue. fun
---
Could be a bug then. A few people started reporting it after the patch. Not sure if anyone has actually stated outright if it’s a bug or not.
---
Sorry, I just gave the last i had to somebody collecting for the NCR. Say, you look familiar.....
---
Spiked Rocket, Bladed Rocket, Puncturing Rocket, and Heated Rocket mods all come from scrapping the baseball bat itself.
---
The plain Rocket and Searing Puncturing Rocket are plans and they can be dropped by Events/Dailies in the Toxic Valley (0.62% chance to drop) and Savage Divide (0.5% chance to drop).
---
My info comes from the Plan &amp; Mod Database google doc that's been floating around for a while.
---
Discovered this the day it was implemented. 
---
I was saying, if you own a workshop and think your teammates can help you defend it, you're wrong. The attacker gets to choose whether or not to engage the owner's teammates. 
---
And the teammates can totally be ganked. 🤣
---
*cries in harpoon gun*
---
If you'd be so kind I would really appreciate it
---
I have a Quad one and it literally breaks halfway through the clip
---
Yes its one of the items you only can craft as an legendary, same as the SS, Gauss-Minigun, etc.
---
The game to not be as bad as it is when it comes to server side processing.
---
And your English?
---
Well shucks thanks
---
I wasn't calling atomic shop new content, I was calling the atlas observatory new content and within the next few days we should also have the ironically named collosal problem. 
---
There's also many minor changes which happen regularly, often many that people don't even notice. (Like the asylum scorched spawn/tent hotfix)
---
Did you seek revenge?
---
Then why make t-65 which never is legendary when I make it?
---
It doesn't connect you to both team and area chat. Just one at a time.
---
Nothing is this game is challenging now, why do you need a companion to make things easier?
---
I guess you could report it to Bethesda, or could try tagging ladydevann and seeing if it’s been reported or not
---
It does, but I think only if you are not in pacifist.
---
With gunsmith 5, I have noticed something up with my explosive guns. They were always pretty quick to break due to how explosives calculate the durability hit, but it seems to be a lot worse as of late. I'm actually making a dent in my repair kit stash.
---
A lot of things seem to be going wrong since update 21. The servers are also less stable, more so than usual. I've been seeing a lot of world errors when it comes to private servers and more crashes than I usually get. Lots of hitching, even with no mods and v-sync turned off.
---
I started a new character for this purpose... Except this new character doesn't use level-ups or perks - specials all stay at a base of 1. I only use it on days I'm not going to level up with my main character, and only get one level with him then switch back. He's level 7, and just finished "Bunker Buster". I'm seeing how far I can get at a low level.
---
Lasers, especially legacy ones are complete garbage.
---
I had this bug happen to me just yesterday on Scorched Earth. When I reloaded into a world I had stable flux in my inventory, so you definitely can still get rewards. I won't say it's a guarantee, and it might vary by when you die/etc. but I  was doubly annoyed because I assumed that my flux would've been gone regardless. It was not.
---
Bethesda needs to stop being stingy with the reputation-gated crafts. Other MMOs also allow player to further give away or sell the crafted items. It helps the player economy and also allows players to twink their alts. 
---
Legendaries dropping only for weapons unlocked by their plans is fine, but I see no issues with selling blank weapons/armor/grenades to other people. Just like I can (and sometimes even do) craft Fixers and sell them now.
---
What is your GT?  Mine is Bwilson1973
---
I picked up 1st. Love the Scrap Box.
---
lol VATs doesn't work in PvP for most weapons.
---
Sounds good. :) And I'm a new player. For me, plenty of quests for now. For you (and me ofc), stuff fixed. :)
---
I've been doing that,  but with mini nukes.
---
Thats Power armor its not legendary. Sadly
---
The limits just need to be periodically raised.
---
It makes sense to have limits, but they're definitely not up to date.
---
Reeses0702.
---
It took me 4 hours to find one...
---
This is probably even easier to implement
---
those are worth many caps, man
---
Seek revenge doesn't come into it. I've done further testing. 
---
As long as a player is inside the claim zone during an attack AND the bar is being stopped because of that player. You can tag and kill even if they are white.
---
I can't believe this issue is still affecting the community. I never encountered it until 2 weeks ago when I checked the atomic shop before joining a world. And what a big mistake it was! On my second week of not receiving any score even though I still try every day to achieve them in hopes that'll count. Sadly that's still not the case.
---
Yes, have ammo weight reduction on my left arm iirc.
---
I got a few weapon weights that are an absolute lifesaver
---
It must have been a few servers, I found a new server and it was fine  after, it's more than likely the camp budget abusers lagging a few servers
---
Thanks! Gives me hope
---
Please delete this.  MM is my all time favorite event right now simply because it never has anyone.  That lets my buddies and I run the thing having fun killing each other without having to worry about the assholes who show up just to hunt legendaries.
---
I don't think they'll answer to someone complaining. I complained about Wood armor's Shrouded not working at all, that was like, a year ago, still not fixed, I just hope one day all this buggy garbage will be polished away, not much else to do.
---
There is a damage cap of 110 in PvP. 
---
VATs also does not work in PvP. 
---
These things could explain your lack of damage output.
---
I miss Atomic Radio...
---
Yeah I need that!
---
So far ive never had lag problems. Hit lvl 50 today. The one recurring problem i have is a black screen where the gameplay should be.....all menus work all interfaces work. But the play area is black. Can only see when i use vats and i just see the green enemy outline. Its happened twice to me. Each time was when bloodbugs attacked me. I hate mosquitos in real life and now everytime i see bloat bugs i expect a game error.
---
Did you just recently reinstall the game?  There was a file you have to edit to change vsync.  I forget.  I had the same problem and it fixed it for me.
---
You need to play a better game
---
As soon as my son is done watching Paw Patrol, I will be on.
---
Are you wanting words or just the Open Sign?
---
Good! Keep in mind are tracking device is broken so you will have to be close enough for it to work 🤔
---
They were in the store in the last month or so, so don't expect them back for a while.
---
It takes forever getting what you want, I know. Still rolling for Uny RA and RL, both are bolstering atm.
---
Haha perfect
---
Thorn isn't PA?  Never bothered with it as I got the straggler set
---
the problem with those goo/ash piles is, theyre visible for other players without any loot inside (most of those piles) also with this new ultra fps drops after recent patch, this is just  kill zone for all players around
---
Ohh, that makes a lot of sense! She was right next to me and I wasn’t expecting the attack, so my first instinct was VATS shot to the face without really thinking about it. Really appreciate your input there!
---
I would trade the cook workbench for a tinkers... Maybe let us choose one workbench to have active at tent.
---
I mean I do understand a cooking pot is easier to carry and assemble at a tent but on the other hand we already carry a stash, a scrap stash, some shelves, carpet, cot, ...
---
You can't really have a jack-of-all-trades character with the perk card system, so having multiple characters with different builds would still be common. That being said, I don't entirely like the idea of pooled resources either. Being able to come fresh out of the vault with thousands of materials and being able to build fusion generators, large purifiers, and things like that would ruin some of the early game survival elements.
---
However, there is a middle-of-the-road solution that would make people pretty happy. Borderlands has a specific storage unit that is shared across all of a player's characters. It's incredibly helpful for sharing weapons and whatnot across your account. Something like this would be incredibly beneficial here. It's not like people aren't already transferring items between characters, it's just tedious with the current system. It would be an easy thing to add and would be a huge quality of life improvement. This would give players the option to give a new character a head start if they want to, or they can maintain the normal experience instead.
---
I want a skin for the LMG more.
---
Riiiiiiiight.......
---
That sounds like something a Synth would say...
---
I had to server jump once on public to find one. Not a big deal.
---
Deathclaw Island. At the northern point, there's a half shack thing and on the the southwestern corner of the roof a bobblehead can spawn. I probably find one there at least 50% of the time (found it on the first try today.)
---
Also Watoga Transit Hub, on the counter next to a terminal closest to the broken elevator. 
---
And in Watoga, in the Hubris Comics behind where Vendor Bot Phoenix is, one can spawn on the counter next to the duffle bag and holotape. Both of these are much rarer spawns than Deathclaw Island though (at least in my experience.)
---
Oooooof
---
Yes, that too.
---
we already have rust devils 🙄
---
Add Ultracite Lasers breaking in 2 seconds, Wood armor Mods not working and a couple thousand bugs to the fixing list and im happy
---
I'm a heavy weapons PA build. Depending on the situation I have different go to weapons. If I need to take out a small group of enemies and I don't want to waste ammo I usually use my Gatling Gun. If I need to "snipe" from a distance I use my Prime Plasma Caster. If I have a large crowd such as one that pops up during Scorched Earth, I use either my Prime LMG or my .50 cal depending on my ammo reserves.
---
Just the open sign. Eventually I'll buy the plans to get all the letters too.
---
No. Everything being swappable is already way too casual. Still not nearly as bad as one wasteland is going to be.
---
You don't hear people talking about them so I presumed they were average. I crafted one in the pts awhile back and thought it was weak
---
. For me  the most usable gauss weapon is the shotgun.
---
But yes, I would love a hammock that works as a bed as well.
---
Negative effects for most anyone drinking from bowl or tank. But Positive effects if you're a plague walker.
---
Yes i thought you mean power armor.
---
Thorn, Solar, SS, G Minigun, G Pistol, G Shotgun Plasma Caster, Gauntlet are only craftable as legendary. I hope i could help.
---
The Nuka girl helmet is actually superior in quality, but alas doesn't have a matching colour for the blue jumpsuit! It works well as a replacement for the atom shop orange one though.
---
It's good but a better solution is to travel light unless its good tier just dump it or scrip it, I usually carry 30 or so weapons at a time and I know it's because I'm a hoarder.
---
Bloodied Explosive/25 vats Railway Rifle. Choo choo motherfucker.
---
I started a new new character about 2 weeks ago and I'm just about to hit 50 now. And I'm sitting on a healthy supply of... about 200 cork. And I have 1st so its not like I'm having to balance my carry weight budget or stash space. 65 mil currently is absolutely a fudged number. Considering how we've seen Bethesda handle FO76, I'm sure whatever underpaid intern who's in change of updating the number decided it was easier to fudge it when they manually update it instead of dealing with the hassle of changing the website like they did for concrete.
---
This is basically one of the things I had in mind when I originally recommended the Tents. The ability to make it a ‘traveling merchant’ setup.
---
Free Range in the Mire netted me 3 legendaries in 10 minutes if you are looking for more good events.
---
Yes!  More 40's big band and vocalists.  Needs more Sinatra, Martin, Armstrong, Crosby, glenn miller.  
---
While on the subject.  And i the only that shoots a radio when Rain of Fure plays?  That song Does NOT belong in fallout
---
Most used weapon is a bloodied gauss shotgun. Great ammo efficiency and when it works properly it hits hard.
---
This is very annoying just started playing the game and now came to a dead end when I started focusing on this quest line ...
---
Lmfao! 🧨Just priceless, and for everything else, please give us your credit card information. 🤑
---
Heavy weapons PA, love my Gatling laser and showing off that I’m a fusion core hog
---
I'd love to see 2 new maps replace the 2 current ones. 
---
Atm most lobbies choose Morgantown because most players are just familiar with it. Those that aren't become familiar with Morgantown fast as it's the map 80% of the time.
---
2 new maps noone knows would away least shake things up if everyone needs to learn the maps at least for the first few days.
---
For context, did you build a camp over their spawn point?  I experienced that on one of my alt camp builds - and they would tell me they were there first blah blah...rather rudely, so I ended up just shooting them not to hear that dialogue over and over. 🙄. If you mean in some other context, elaborate?
---
Joining now
---
Any pics you'll share?
---
Yea for me, I always have that lingering idea. Man I wish I can have fun with fallout with a friend same for Skyrim (Until Skyrim together mod was made). But there was no mods to do that. Fallout 76 filled that gap for me sure the game is not perfect I see all games for what it is is why It's hard for me to get upset with any games with issues tied to them sense I know in my heart no game is perfect and helps me avoid pitfalls all these years. (Just don't have time nor energy to waste on hating imperfect games, I have better ways to spend my time on)
---
I felt Bethesda read most of our minds on wanting to play Fallout with a friend and share the experience together rather than just a single player experience and I believed that was there idea when they made the game.
---
You should also be able to sell them
---
Yep. Won my first match that way.
---
That profile pic is majestic! :D
---
Have you seen the gravity in this game? If I, Ward, dead scorchbeasts and ghouls can float in the air, bullets shouldn't have an issue.
---
Yet the game is still way too buggy. I know the new boss is coming but, like many and myself included said before, adding new content to a game so broken is not what we need. I already decided to stop playing yesterday and, honestly, I'm not missing it at all. That new boss won't make me come back either. I can understand that people who still have hope that things will get better in the near future are holding on to whatever crumbs of content (I myself can hardly call the atlas event "content" since I went there once and never came back to it ... it was actually the opposite of new content since the update made my BoS underarmor become a useless outfit) Bethesda is throwing at them. I hope for y'all that no major bugs/exploits won't show up as soon as the new boss will be available.
---
I'm not spitting on the game for the pleasure, let's be clear here. I just wish it would get better but the fact that Bethesda keeps showing us that they couldn't care less is revolting. I never felt that way for any game developper before.
---
how can i carry 200 shotguns and 10000 shotgun shells?
---
I haven't used them b/c I can't find a consistent answer on what perks if any affect them.
---
Fair point , I still do wonder what would happen if bullet drop was in this game
---
The only way i would think off is some strange mutation , Or the grace of todd
---
Because it's a game that never even remotely claimed to be based in realism. The game struggles as it is without the added math. You want realistic bullet drop? Go play sniper elite.
---
Why didn't you leave the server?
---
[also this comic book logic applies to this situation](https://imgur.com/qbWBU4M)
---
It's totally useless anyway. Even if I take off all my armor it isn't worth it. Cute cosmetic I guess? But completely lacking in function. Faster rads taken standing in water
---
Did you read the description ? I already know why it’s just a thought
---
It is not a mobile game, it is a triple of a large company, the limitations make the game boring, I play this game for 600 hours, I completed all the missions, legendary race, everything, the only thing I don’t have is a good weapon , so how can I get one if I have to go 150 every 150 delivering a million legends that I accumulated with so much playing time?
---
When you say "gradually increase" to them it will sound, so let's change from 150 to 300 for two more years, because it is profitable like this "
---
you have to take the limit, or level it, low levels have more limits and high levels don't.
---
this game needs purpose as it doesn't have a decent endgame.
---
I’m working my way up to being able to purchase the plans for a gauss shotgun, intrigued to see how good it is.!
---
Pretty much
---
It happens.  Don’t let a couple bad apples ruin your time in game.  Just move to a different server - problem solved.
---
I only log into NW to do the daily quest but I'll at least stay until the match is over. Recently got to lvl 17 in NW by doing so.
---
You're 100% right, it breaks down way to fast.  I have a 2 shot one and gave up on it because it broke so often, it sometimes wouldn't even make through one SBQ fight.  Parked it on a display rack and switched over to a 2 shot plasma.  Not only does it last longer but I'm delivering much better damage with it.
---
Explosive effect kinda dosen't work on sbq but if your other minigun was faster fire or had limb or bash damage it might of been bugged doing more damage than it should've
---
Is the gatling laser what I see a lot of people use at SBQ? Always wondered what gun it was!
---
Not in power armor. It has terrible accuracy but it’s a beast in VATS. best suited for a bloodied build with unyielding armor imo. It was a nice addition to my arsenal and helps me spread my ammo usage out more so I don’t use as much 5mm and .50. 
---
If you roll a bloodied reduced VATS cost you will have a lot of fun sniping. Mine is bloodied/limb damage/25% reduced VATS cost.
---
IE Lever. Delicious.
---
I only do those events on FO1st. Cause 9 times out of 10 that will happen.
---
Ok I'll be right over to my camp. Someone asked me to try placing an ammo converter in theirs.
---
Guys I got the bag xD I forgot to let reddit know I was so excited lol
---
Lol are you being serious... the game already struggles to run and now you want it to have to process things like bullet drop and wind, have you ever played a fallout game before because I think you’re missing the point of them.
---
They are good, but if you use vats they miss most of the times unless you charge them first
---
Thats a lot of Dam golf ⛳ balls 😳  you better call the order of mysteries, to have them investigate this!
---
Believe soap scraps oil?  I often do a scrap run through Whitesprings Resort for soap, among other useful things for camp build alt addicts 😎
---
* Get an Assaultron Helmet
---
* Get 3-Star Super Duper
---
* Scrap helmet, craft helmet til Super Duper procs. Repeat.
---
* Scrap helmets then the Scrap Assaultron Heads when you're done for free screws, circuits and silver
---
I’m with you. I think they’re doing a great job. Maybe not up to the standards of all day everyday players but for filthies like me it’s a great bug free experience with new stuff all the time and I’m sinking an entire day a week!
---
I work in technology and this shit is hard to fix and keep up with relative to the benefit vs cost of capital being sunk..
---
At this point its pretty obvious they will auto pass or move the goal posts to make missing any of these challenges impossible.  
---
If literally no cork was donated from this point on it would still auto-pass.
---
That’s why bullets don’t have drop and wind doesn’t affect them, We were all given a special mutation by the grace of Todd. You happy now?
---
Ooh! Still learning what all the abbreviations mean, is that an instigating explosive?
---
Haha no I just came by because I needed literally one razergrain and they were the nearest farm fast travel point after a horde event i did
---
They just kept harassing me nonstop the moment I showed up
---
I was in power armor and one of them implied he wanted to chuck me in the ocean to use as an anchor and I was like "wtf dood, also fucking hello"
---
Both my camp and my tent could not be farther from these rude ass turds
---
I have a chest and right leg with weapon reduction
---
And many caps I have
---
Sounds like something a filthy commie would say...
---
Okay.  It won't let me invite you to a team.  If you could team invite me, that would be great.
---
While it's a mess on PC, it's plenty fun on PS4!
---
I can get behind that.
---
I'm going to chalk it up and say that the community was a little too quick with the justified complaints before the unpaid intern could fudge the count. A quick deletion of a "0" to quell the community for a day.
---
Now it's in reverse. They fudged it up too quick now. 65 million cork in less than a day?
---
A casino. Id love to win gold or script by gambling caps.
---
There is one in the maintenance room on South side of the park, there are also some lockers to the east of the wave pool that has a chance to spawn one.
---
Yeah so we can have twice as many locations to fast travel to and browse your shitty collection of multiple mounted bloodbug heads at 400 caps each.
---
B50LMB15 Double Barrel it's so fun blasting literally everything to dismembered limbs besides the bosses
---
Correct. There is a bathtub underneath a electrical tower south of Sutton, IIRC, that has like 20 soap inside.
---
You sound like you have every situation covered! Wish I was that efficient Ahahah
---
I think having a barrel full of radiation at your camp is a must have.
---
Not now, paid 10k before dupe, now...2 or 3 k
---
That would be interesting, who would run the place ? Modus Could  , be , interesting, member ?
---
I'm so far behind, it's a real struggle for me
---
They ended up leaving before we did. We were with a friend making trades and fixing up our bases. We didn’t want to leave, but these guys just kept the pressure on. Will definitely probably leave next time though. People like that just make it less fun IMO. Best to avoid them.
---
It was actually on Regular Scorchbeasts. Not the queen. Its a B/E/15r and the regular one is a B/33/90 to be more specific
---

I'm pretty sure it does. When I'm doing events with a lot of people (ie scorched earth) I can talk with everybody whether they are in my team or not.
---
I’m confused. As far as I’m aware Jet gives +AP and Turbo is what slows down time? At least in the older games.
---
Thanks peeps, I went for it and sure enough, grouped by myself in a public team with no teammates gets the +2 bonus. Woot!
---
Try inviting me now
---
It's ok, he's a hologram, you can go stand inside him... :-)
---
I thought Outer Worlds was really great, and I played through 3 times before i really had my fill.
---
But this is a easy one
---
converted munitions factory has oil resource out front
---
I've got a bos hospital camp with crashed vertibird &amp; a landing pad. Even a non useable vertibird would be cool.
---
We need a week long double xp event
---
We didn’t want to have to leave as we were in the middle of making deals and helping build up our bases. I wanted to get these peeps names out there though so people know to avoid them, or if they choose to leave the server.
---
Im talking about the F4 jet, which slowed down time for 10s
---
Definitely agree. I don’t see them ever improving tbh. Their games have always been buggy and they’re so used to the community fixing it for them. So now they don’t know how to.
---
I had to leave Tyler County Dirt Track and travel to the fairgrounds just to kill a Liberator who was hiding/glitched into a building, marker and all. As soon as I kill him the timer runs out because I'm too far away and it turns from a 10 minute hide and seek Defend Event to "Retake the Dirt Track!" 
---
Man, that is some frustrating ish.
---
Good to know that location, too!  Thanks 😎
---
Ah, I’m more familiar with the New Vegas jet that gives +AP and Turbo is what slows down time. Forgot they did some changes in 4.
---
Winning scrip would be better, who needs film lines?
---
Try putting on a forceful stock
---
That it would , im hoping we get some military stuff maybe . An apc ? A vertibird ? Think the brotherhood wants old tech so why wouldn’t they restore a tank or two ?
---
Go to the atom shop and scroll to the emotes. Make sure they are checked. Sometimes they get unchecked!! Then they don’t show in game.
---
I really dislike that its always Morgantown because long term players know where everything is and have a much bigger advantage.   I really hate running around with my combat shotgun to get one-shot by someone with a super powerful explosive weapon.   There should be 6 or 8 maps and the computer randomly decides which one to use.  You find out when you spawn in the world.
---
Hopefully the "blacklisted" songs would be easier to get ahold of the license of.  And it seems the standard licensing period is 10 years for games, which is more than enough time for Fallout 76 to use them (and if the game is still running when those licenses run out, they can always patch them out).
---
Not sure what a foodbuild is but I play a carry weight build as a stealth vats sniper. I may be trash but I sure do have fun. :)
---
Edit: I'm a half decent bush wookie in NW though. Gotta unlock those camp items and score stuff somehow.
---
Weird, I've never been able to when in a team while also having auto enabled.
---
Heh, if you like that, you’re gonna LOVE [this. ](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic)
---
It's been a brutal grind for me considering far too many days and weeks have been lost to the auto complete bug...
---
That's how we will get the first season of the amazon fallout series.
---
There you go.  You should be able to move it and store it.
---
easiest place is the weight room at the motel on your way to flatwoods’
---
 You know , i would but this thing still costs tons , 40 k high , 20k low
---
It can occur on any event, usually happens during the SBQ for me, the only solution is to hard shut down the game, which means there won't be any loot when you return...
---
Thank you so much!!! I doubt you happen to have jack o lanterns by chance?
---
Forgot about that one, thanks
---
Bush wookie a only exist because Bethesda forces us to play a game mode we don't want to get stuff we do want. Also how does someone hiding and not attacking you hurt your experience in any way? 😂
---
The junkies is also 'magic'. The bloodied one will work well without any special effects.
---
I'd keep all three.
---
Submit a ticket, you'll get your atoms back and get to keep it.
---
Never does for me, after an hour I gave up and closed the game down!
---
There’s a motel in Flatwoods that has a gym with lots of weights which scrap down to lead! I’d do a few runs there
---
Thanx for the suggestion. It is checked and the problem persists.
---
No button presses work during this bug!
---
Sadly, in order for any of the bugs to get fixed properly, you have to speak to them in terms of $$$$. That's all they see and what EVERYTHING comes down to. Greed and "how is fixing this going to be profitable to US?"
---
Most interesting thing will be the instanced camps. Might make all of the prefabs they bring out pointless.
---
Whats DARPA when you can VATS
---
Id love to play some blackjack for scrip. But they should definetly replace J/Q/K/A with Cryptits (i hope i spelled that right)
---
I said I haven't experienced any increase of lag. Though a lot of people have so I believe I have just lucked out somehow.
---
As for the camp thing, I know that it was case because if you are in a team and crash, you rejoin the server and every time I have for about 3 weeks now I get the notification that someone has their camp there and do I want to find another server.
---
I have one of the kacko lanterns let me get some pumpkins
---
What level are you? Do you have Excavator Power Armor?
---
OH MY GOD. Jen from Foundation could be the radio host. That’d give her something else fun to do after the Vault heist.
---
“Eve of Destruction” by Barry McGuire would be a must-have, they could really siphon a lot of ideas from the MAFIA III soundtrack.
---
I haven’t used a railway rifle in 76 yet but it was my must use in fo4 and I LOVED it
---
33 vats is bugged as well.look up angry turtle magic weapons.in this case explosive should be stronger but due to that bug its not..
---
The VT jumpsuit is not one of the rare ones.
---
That’s kind of what I thought. Would be so useful, I usually have to scramble switching my cards around to a completely different figuration every time I need to go fight the queen. Among many other situations where I need to rearrange
---
LVL 31 and no, i dont know how to get it
---
A lot of us would buy something small, as a way to let the owner know we were there and to say ‘Nice Camp!’  
---
This Daily Challenge seems to be an ‘extension’ of that, in a way.
---
Which ones are that?
---
A combat helmet with working headlamp but we all now that ain’t happening ☹️
---
I think those instanced camps are gonna be either annoying buggy (Surprise surprise) Or they will be perfect
---
Armor pen i broken for them i beleive, atleast it was
---
The Prison Yard has a ton of weights &amp; a tinker bench as well.  I farmed it just last night to make the sweet sweet ammo.
---
One of my favorite Daly grind weapons. Free ammo as you kill.
---
There was a bundle recently that had a red wallpaper.
---
However all wallpapers are atomic shop related so I suggest you check there weekly for one.
---
You can solo her, you just need decent weapons and good amount of healing, depending where you aim the nuke you can even use some buildings for additional shielding from her melee attacks but usually the most dangers come from the spawns she summons each time she lands ....
---
Who knows ? The brotherhood update may give it to us , they used CA so possibly
---
Where about is the prison located?
---
Just kill a mongrel and your get some dog meat
---
Don't all silos have weight rooms also,
---
Did you kill them?
---
Ok so I’ve haven’t played 76 for like the last months so what the heck is going on rn and why is everyone pissed
---
Less captain cosmos level and more liberty prime level skins for weapons please. Imo cosmos looks to smooth, idk something about how everything is rounded throws me off and makes it look bad. It's a shame it's variant was a level 100 score reward, used it for maybe a day and went back to atomic T-65.
---
And the fire station
---
The Eastern Regional Penitentiary is a prison in the Toxic Valley area of Appalachia. It is located to the South of Grafton, and to the North of the Morgantown Airport. - from the fallout wiki
---
The church bell.
---
That would be amazing but it’s been requested since launch but that would be a awesome surprise . Different color headlamps mods like the pa 🤞
---
Totally agree!!!  Some nice ornate stairs would be a great addition.
---
Most people bought FO76 for an online sandbox rpg type thing. Battle royal isn't really an expansion on that. And you're not taking your normal character and load out into it. You have an abridged version and none of your normal gear. Its basically a fallout themed Fortnite tacked onto 76. Which isn't necessarily bad, but that consumed resources that could have been used to rebuild some type of pvp in 76 in some different way, which hopefully would have been more in line with traditional Fallout.
---
I think that even 1 person not experiencing any bugs is highly improbable and would the absolute maximum, so yes.
---
Low level! Im not going through a silo at lvl 30. I do t have the patience for that
---
I lob them at the noobs on v9 while waiting for nukes to drop.  it doesn't hurt no one but its fun.
---
If you got one for 10k before the duping you got a bargain. And they're still going for quite a bit on the trade forum. Even as recent as 4 days ago one went for more than 30k worth of trade. And another went for 200 crimson flux which is about 25-30k worth. 
---
The recent duping shenanigans was exaggerated to hell. Apparently the red asylum uniform was duped yet there was no increase of those on the market.
---
But if you can get them for 2-3k then good on you. you could make a tidy profit.
---
Ok, thanks
---

---
If you liked 4 76 it's worth a shot. Just go in not expecting a flawless gem, it's got problems and bugs. For some though the good outweighs ther bad.
---
No as far as I am aware there will be a small break between seasons. But as far as atoms coming back during that time I doubt it but no one knows.
---
From what I am aware, there is a count the game keeps of what you picked up, where and how much since. After around 250 items they start respawning again.
---
It's making me reload after half a clip. Sometimes even after just 3 rounds
---
Woah there buddy ! The normal lamp is one thing but coloured ? Why ? Also knowing todd and co it will probably cost bullion
---
I'ma set one up in the middle of the dam, for Deezer.
---
MMmmm Delicious Deezers Lemonade.
---
Assuming no one has picked it up before you, I've always heard that you must pick up 180 items before the original will respawn for you.
---
Oil can&lt;180 items&lt;oil can.
---
Sure it's at the start..
---
Looking at your replies.... why you so pressed over peoples' suggestions😭😭 also why not move ur damn camp dude
---
I have it stuck too. Did you ever figure out how to remove it?
---
Charleston Fire Station weight room has a TON of lead weights.  Usually it's not picked clean like the hotel everyone else is suggesting.
---
Yup. You'll get that explosive explosive bow one day, and it will disappoint
---
Ok, that makes it a lot easier
---
Also, Vault Tec University has a couple of weights in the room with the exercise bikes.
---
At this time of day? Entirely located within one end of Grafton dam?
---
Charleston fire department has a weight room.
---
Unfortunately the one this week only has an orange-ish color :(
---
Spiral stairs
---
Why are you on this sub
---
I’ve played Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim, so I’m really into the lore and writing in ESO. So even if the quest structure itself is kind of repetitive, I enjoy the dialogue and the characters. (It also doesn’t feel any more repetitive than Skyrim, to me at least.) I also have a lot of fun crafting, doing master writs, scrying, map completion stuff with guildmates, etc. (so obviously I don’t have a lot of thoughts about combat. I just wanna rush through the fights to get to the other stuff.)
---
I’m not exactly wrong But I ain’t right either
---
On PC? I've bought a couple for nowt, have like 3 now on display for the different colours
---
I think Free Range is the worst for this sort of thing.  I swear players just watch the icon on the map until it's at the end of the path and then come over.   What you're describing has happened way to often to my during this event.
---
Fallout76prefs.ini
---
Look for:
---
iPresentInterval
---
Change to:
---
iPresentInterval=0
---
Should be listed under [Display]; should be the top anyway.  
---
If it's not there then add the line somewhere in this section.
---
This fixed my problem
---
Nice
---
I asked because the dude said it reset him to white after every death. Either he was choosing to respawn or was trapped in an event cycle. 
---
Trust me, I know everything there is to know about the PvP in this game.
---
It’s very easy to fix, or at least give us different modes to choose from. At least in one mode we get to bring our own weapons (no legendary effects) and no silly stuff like frog legs, that mode will attract real fps gamers who frequent COD, BF and CS. Relying on dumb luck and waste a bunch of time in the lobby then die in fifteen secs is a shitty game mode for anyone who wants to play a shooting game.
---
I just want the monologue of her problems and our problems and how she appreciates us.... GONE. That's all.
---
It's not like all that we all make mistakes and no one is crying and being all like oh I'm gonna quit the game and so forth. It's a fair critique and to ask that they fix or change it so that this doesn't remain an issue. You're assuming everyone blasted through it so quickly when in fact some people just play more then others so of course they'll complete it faster then others who may play less. It's not the players fault it's Bethesda's fault for not thinking ahead and providing the necessary amount of content or changes to begin with.They should've known this would happen and prevented it.
---
That is accurate...pretty much what I got in my bos provisions..
---
Seriously, ALWAYS shot in third person and always melee in first person.  Do yourself a favor and spec for auto or heavy once you start getting some perk cards.  Hip firing is only really doable once you have the cards that say increased hip fire accuracy.  Aim while in 3rd person and you will get better.  It’s a pretty steep curve, but you can do it!  I’d be down to play at some point if you’re on Xbox.  The true key to survival is getting a team with mics
---
Just quit the game when you are at the terminal to analyze blood samples. Once you load the game again you will be outside the building and should have the quest step to install fuse and analyze blood sample. Next, go into the building and find the terminal + fuse box. Install fuse and then go to terminal to analyze the blood. I didn't have to load the samples again either. This is the only thing that worked for me.
---
My pleasure friend, can’t keep gems like that a secret, especially amongst the community.
---
256 it's a binary counter flipping over, for picking more things up to make them respawn.  Angry turtle has a video on his experiments with it
---
I did just reinstall yeah! I'll try that. I found it odd I couldn't turn sync off in the in game menu and that's usually an issue since I'm already using gsync.
---
/uthyartismurder66
---
i definitely believe this non-shady and not suspicious request for me to slave away gathering insane amounts of material for the chance of more useless items. anyway here is my entire stashbox storage of lead, 2,500
---
I saw a public team member trying to do violent night solo, not sure if that was his intent or just ended up that way. I never did it before so i showed up to see what it was about. He was sitting down playing the instrument, i was in power armor. I stood there killing mobs as he continued to play. Not sure if it helped or not, but he stayed seated the whole time. Another player showed up and was killing many enemies before me, so I thought I would help the first guy and get out of the PA and pick up an instrument. 
---
I died just as the legendary arrived, high level that showed up last stopped protecting us to go kill it and as I got back from respawn it was dead. 
---
Not sure where i went wrong, but first guy gave a thumbs up, so maybe not so bad.
---
Then find Lucky Hole Mine.....all the lead....
---
Hi Eldyrus!
---
I am contacting you on behalf of my client, a VERY well know influencer in the West Virginian region, about a proposal that will benefit you greatly. If you give me  (woops, sorry, I meant my client)  the following materials (minimum 2,500,000) -Lead, Steel,  Screws and Ballistic fiber, I can guarantee you will get Great Exposure in Appalachia that will surely lead to the NCR's success when they arrive!
---
My client has 25,000 followers in multiple high profile groups, so you know they are kind of a big deal and are just dripping with that sweet, sweet exposure all the big name groups crave so much. They have worked with other Big Name Factions such as The Responders and The Free States in the past and it has worked out well for them!
---
Please be quick about accepting my clients generous offer as I have contacted many Big Name Factions eager to branch out into Appalachia!
