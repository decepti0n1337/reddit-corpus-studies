It unlocks the perks after you have points spent in the stat. Therefore, you save your perk card selection until you have enough points to get what you want. My build was finished at level 70, and that was WITH being indesisive about the weapon archetype I wanted. So it goes like this, level up, select the special stat increase, look for the card you want, if you haven't unlocked yet, you pick NO perks.
---
---
---
I’d do the same thing except keep killing them until they left
---
Yeah, you *would* extremely appropriate those plans! Psh, just like a typical [INSERT DEMOGRAPHIC HERE].
---
Its doable by yourself.  I'm level 51 and I've been only solo. It takes a little longer. Join multiplayer events. You dont have to join a team to be part of an event. And you do get good rewards for your level.
---
I spent close to two hours last night looking for those, and never saw a single mutant hound. Normally the things seem like they’re everywhere.
---

---
Wolves spawn reliably a little west of Widow’s Perch, you could kite one back and in to like the Rusty Pick pretty easily I bet.
---
I agree Whitesprings but I went the sneak route with Instigating rifle and some Adrenaline perk and lots of events in the forest
---
No it's expensive as hell for one gun that isn't even as good as people claim.
---
Hack auto correct you failed me again
---
Try 800k caps ;) I play on my main. I do shop stuff on alts.
---
ive noticed a huge slowdown as well,today out of 6 runs i got 1 that had enough people to pass. im just glad i got the one item i wanted before it seemingly died off
---
Does the radio actually play? It just does nothing for me, but I remember it working in beta.
---
The appalachian version doesn't say police box outside, cause the super mutants aren't loving the law. (And is my box and says tardis cause i like it :p. )
---
Hahahaha amazing!
---
I was just wondering if I could get some help, is all.
---
If you find Graham, he usually has it for a good price.  Thats how I got mine :)
---
Yeah I woulda paid probably 20k. Caps are cheap and too easy to get. They mean nothing. I can't get rid of them fast enough
---
You can't skip perk card selection at any level.
---
I found a tourist by fast travelling betweet phillippi cemetary, landview light house, Colonel Kelly Monument and Wavy Williards. If I didn't find it I server hopped by my 3rd server hop I found a tourist at the Kelly Monument.
---
All of these points are close to each other and the Tourist is close to the spawn point
---
Wavy Williards leaning on a car
---
Phillppi Cemetary amongst the Grave markers
---
Colonel Kelly Monument top of the stairs on a bench
---
Landview Light House top of light house leaning on railing.
---
Good luck I hope this helps
---
One a day, wow.. Were you around before they nerfed TSE and Whitenight?  Back then before they started their nerfing and extending the farming aspect, you could server hop and be  guaranteed to find a nuke with 20 or so minutes pretty much any server you went on.  I remember seeing up to 3 simultaneous nuke zones.
---
That didn't stop them from having the brotherhood of steel time travel and it certainly won't stop them from selling more skins.
---
Sure he can, and I, as well as everyone else with a sane mind isn't going to pay those prices. That's completely ridiculous. Weapons should be worth a few hundred per star MAX. Not everyone trades for 25000 for one gun back and fourth and lives on that. Most of the players are like me, with a few thousand caps, and the people who really need the weapons. If it's in the machine, they aren't using it, so why be greedy? Its just a suggestion they would make more caps, and more friends with lower prices.
---
Yeah the very first times it was an "encounter" but after a few times I knew there must be some mechanic so I marked the spot on the map and always run there when I log in and am always exited what iam gonna expect when I go there. Very good job on these maps, maybe bring them all together on a website?
---
They drop from the SBQ as an event reward (not corpse loot).
---
I server hopped from the location described in this video. Could see from the spawn point it was there without killing any mobs. https://youtu.be/Nvi1qSoQHPs
---
Took me over 40 min :(
---
Bethesda ( Game System, I think)
---
Hmm I know I’ve gotten them recently, I’m curious where I got them if they aren’t coming off deathclaws. Pretty sure I found one on the dead alpha body near the fissure in the cranberry bog by watoga. So maybe it’s only coefficient spawns?
---
I don't even understand what point you're trying to make, but my point still stands. I was rude yes. He was a little shit charging an arm and a leg, so he deserves a little reality check. He still was charging WAY too much for this weapon.
---
Do you really need a compare feature to be completely honest it's easy enough to compare without it
---
Now that's the kind of camp you drop a nuke on lol
---
I mean I could actually help you and do quests or I could craft you a level 25 Handmade and some ammo, a good starter weapon imo that should last you.
---
Yup every now and then I'll come accross some dipshit blasting what sounds like guitar feedback (put a guitar too close to the amp) or some other noise which is clearly just to try and mess with other players I just mute them.
---
Go to the map click on thier dot and mute very simple
---
Yea I got the atom shop desert camo for free, one day was painting my PA and it was in my drop down for every part except the head. I cant make it anymore so have to keep it this color, luckly it was my stealth boy t51b.  But the camo really hides your PA in some areas
---
I'd assume limitations of the server or game. Overly complicated CAMPs means higher load on the servers. As for some of the stranger aspects like most things related to the stairs and roofs, that's probably more of just a couple bugs.
---
You need the laying dawn pose on the bearskin rug.
---
Yeah, I know a few people have offered to help the Mappalachia crew get the maps on an interactive map. I'll definitely update this post if that happens.
---
_We're all in this together_
---
I'm gonna find my way into your bedroom and take a shit on your bed, then pick all your collectors and fast travel away so you couldn't claim the bounty you moody hermit
---
Are you playing on Xbox, PS4 or PC?
---
I mean I just walk over them until they break, but that's just because I have the healing factor and plague walker mutations. Less hassle for the next guy and free damage for me lol.
---
The people paying this much are the problem, and he deserved what I said, even if I shouldn't have said it. He's getting away with highway robbery. This needs to stop, weapons in the game are NOT worth these caps, If I don't have days to pour into the game to farm for items, and Johnny does, but he has a weapon I can use and he can't, he shouldn't want more than half the MAXIMUM caps for ONE item...
---
Oh okay so where do you find the Scorch Beast Queen?
---
Cool how bout chickens?
---
Can we agree they quit listening to us when they put repair kids in the store?
---
Or did we all just move on from that?
---
I've tested the theory of letting 3* Regen then finish several times and only got  a 3* 10% of the time
---
No radiation
---
Flatwood monster has chased me across the map once, stood it ground once (and died to the team), and run away once.
---
Mothman (red eyes) always poofs off.
---
Mothman (yellow-orange eyes) stood its ground and fired back, but I had nothing that was affecting it,.  It did not pursue when I walked away,
---
And with it your canvas bag
---
You can still find them without killing, or youtube it
---
You talking about the “learn 76 weapon plans”? Here’s the thing, there’s more than 76 in game. I have that challenge completed.
---
I meant the boss/alpha/leader that comes AFTER defeating the three packs
---
What do you have in the Private area that we could possibly steal/hurt/interfere with irreparably? We just need to scrap our junk and repair our gear
---
Yup, that about sums it up
---
Connection issues? I've had no problems for quite awhile on my PS4... Try resetting your connection in the Playstation menu (delete the settings and re do them. There are more advanced tips but I wouldn't be able to walk you through them here.
---
There are some very good guides online that can help.
---
Also run a connection test. If your wireless you may have to change the wifi channel in your router settings but this is mainly a problem in high population areas. If too many people in a close area are using the same wifi channel it can interfere with the connection.
---
Also a wired connection is always best if you can do that.
---
Nono still have a stash and all the crafting tables and whatnot silly
---
You can't get them no matter what though. Only if you pour hours a day to get those resources you need to sell, and even then how about repairs? Ammo? Food? Water? The list goes on, everyone here seems to never buy anything, and always get god roll drops on anything they loot from a level 1 molerat.
---
PS4
---
Super Frustrating.
---
The Possum badge costs for the vendor machine are way too high considering how many of the badges are impossible or next to impossible to earn and the only other way to get them is by participating in the extremely buggy, many times glitched, Camp Tales event, that can usually only be completed about one out of 10 times, and only drops the patch one out of 10 completions.
---
And instead of fixing it Bethesda drops more buggy, glitched content with more frustrating, rigged RNG.
---
Just pick up where you left off. I usually don't start the story until level 50 (4 Play throughs) anyways so use it as a leg up. 
---
Plus if you get up to possum in the scouts, regular exploring will unlock badge requirements. 
---
I did the encryptid event with my low level. Well participated anyways, I definitely wouldn't do that now because of the low player turn out at the event but you may be able to help fill the troughs during paradise.
---
Hunting Lodge basement in Toxic Valley.  There's a taxidermy room...
---
No theres no chickens there that I know of.
---
I'm not even expecting big baddy gear from 3* just at least some sorta junk 3*... A 3* at the very least...
---
Ok thanks
---
Thank you
---
While bugs in the game are not nearly as bad as they once were, problems are always present when PVP is instigated. I really should be an adventure mode with no player to player damage whatsoever. Then the survival mode staying unrestricted for PVP players to entertain themselves.
---
Those are the prices they should be at.
---
Mod plans? There’s mods for it? Oh lord I don’t want to go back in there.
---
Thanks for the help
---
Unfortunately I have only got to try twice and event failed both times.
---
Are you on PC?  I'll farm out a nuke with ya.
---
Yeah there is, I fear I'll never get my hands on one...
---
Don't you just move the box to change the spawn point
---
Good on you. Report them
---
Follow-on thought: In Elder Scrolls III (Morrowind), you *could* make notes on the map... And none of their games since. So Bethesda *used* to know how to do it.
---
You could, if you want. Im closer to 30 now because of a helpful redditor, but I wouldnt mind the help one bit!
---
I ran into that earlier as well. Found a good deal on some black titanium and kept getting that message.
---
It's not normal at all though, most players are like me, we don't have a million hours to play and farm, and buy and sell, we aren't caught up on the "newest craze" on the reddit market, and we sure as hell don't make the 1400 cap a day sell limit.
---
That is true.   Online not, and have to have PS+ to play.
---
When I got the game, I didn’t have PS plus, and no advertising copy said it was required.  I was more than a bit annoyed, so planned on the game.
---
That’s was shorty after launch, and I could not return it for the price I paid, so I kept it and got a PS+ subscription.
---
Glad I did.  I really haven’t played anything else since I installed it January.
---
It is infuriating. Every time i start playing its an ordeal
---
I agree with you, neither of those weapons should be anywhere near that high. Like 600 maybe for the railway, and I'd pay 200 max for the cane.
---
Ditto for the Entomologist badge, you can’t just pick up a mothman wing that someone else drops, gotta get it from the source.
---
Does this mean the responder travelling vendor spawns in more then one place in the forest?
---
Where ever you place your camp upon relocating will make your spawn point. But I somehow spawn outside my camp while others spawn at the center underneath the floors
---
WHERE ARE ALL THE CHICKENS
---
Part of capitalism is competitive pricing though, and I've seen very little of that. Just items getting more and more expensive. 90% of the people couldn't even hold all the caps if some psychopath were to ACTUALLY buy out their stock...
---
Capt Noob did a review a while back of a little dagger that had an obscene swing speed. Coupling SS with Martial Artist is fun as hell. I don’t know what TH melee have fast speed as default. I use Grog and it’s obv slow, but better with SS and MA perk for sure.
---
I think a lot of folks have decided to take it a bit slower. Like right now I’d only go in if I knew I’d get some backup from friends. I’m on PC though.
---
It’s definitely less of a “glorious chaotic mess” style event than say, Scorched Earth or Fasnacht.
---
You can get swing speed on all of the melee weapons as a legendary effect. All unarmed weapons are medium swing speed per the wiki.
---
Yeah it's always a crap shoot. Im ok with going to people with lots of armor cuz i collect outfits, gotten a lot since vendors came. Its always a crap shoot just like farming Legendaries. Story: i wanted a Chameleon piece i couldn't afford and someone else bought it, next day or two still scanning vendors i found 2 Chameleon, both better and cheaper than the 1 one combined. You never know but almost everything ive been looking for i found eventually. I think displaying the lvl wouldnt be as complicated as displaying exactly what they have but it would at least save time determining what vendor to visit and take your chances.
---
Well if you want, I can help you. Though considering I’m 100 levels higher I’m not too sure how much of a help I’ll be...but again, you day so and I’ll do it.
---
Because nowhere in ad copy does it say you /must/ have PS+ to play... 
---
Not all “on-line” features of other PS games require plus....so if you are not a hardcore gamer, ya may not know. 
---
That doesn’t make OP stupid.
---
I like the dagger, I use a SS one too. 
---
Kinda like the full auto vats crit builds that rifles use, I use the same thing for my dagger and it works great. I’m just wondering if there is something even faster, and if there is a “fast” base swing for any unarmed weapons
---
So you are saying you should reap all the rewards of other people's hard work because you don't want to pay what they want to charge? Grinding hours on end to get a lucky rare find 1 out of 100 weapons and you want it dirt cheap? No, never going to happen.
---
 Maximum caps is 25,000 and it's super easy to get there.
---
 I have around 700 hours in the game and still haven't got the exact weapons I want because they are super rare.  Rare weapons bring high value.
---
 I'd gladly pay 20k for one of my dream weapons. Just paid 8k the other day for one that was close to my dream weapon. Caps are easy to make so I'd gladly spend them.
---
For reference
---
https://youtu.be/XTNLW27N6ro
---
For a while I’d play the Willy Wonka of Nuka-Cola, ran around in a Nuka-Cola jacket and jeans, bottle cap glasses, and a top hat. Dropped bags of all the different colas for newbies. Of course, one of them was always a Nukashine as well...
---
You’re never too casual lol, play the way you want!
---
(That said if you feel like you’re a filthy casual at heart, come on down and join us at r/fo76filthycasuals)
---
How about one team works on bug fixes and the other continues creating content? They need to pause one of their projects if they don’t want F76 to crash and burn like Anthem.
---
That asshole charged way too much
---
Railway rifles are not worth that many caps at all.
---
Other items he had were priced high as well.
---
Likely a basement dweller with unlimited farm time.
---
Like I would ever buy from anybody pricing so ridiculously.
---
My GF spent a long time collecting all of the magazines from vendors and buying from other players. We were super disappointed when it didn’t work.
---
I like to think this is a glitch due to the fact that trading and selling comics is a big part of the industry IRL.
---
I heard people say they got them off of gulpers. Ive killed a lot of gulpers recently and haven’t found any on them.
---
He gave me little choice, and I was frustrated with him. Also his lack of communication made me even angrier.
---
as far as i can tell, it's only a rare drop from some events like breach &amp; clear. it doesn't spawn in the same leveled list that gives you cryo grenade, mirv grenade, etc plans
---
I just submitted a ticket today for the same
---
Issue. It’s reset all of my fully stocked vending machines 4 separate times now and not once did my power go off at my camp. I won’t be participating in vending at my camp until it’s fixed out of frustration for how many times it’s happened. Why should I restock my machine tonight just for it to empty and reset again tomorrow?
---
I dont think it would be too bad, but that depends on their existing code which Ive never seen.  It would be prettt sweet though.
---
A skin for the cultist blade or the ski sword would be awesome. Turn it into a real sword!
---
You have a picture of them or a source?
---
Bethesda needs to put a please close door sigb in the atmoic shop. Id buy the shit out of it. Lol
---
Also why do legendaries have ai to run away all the time? Is it just me that happens to?
---
Lag is the thing we need fixed.  better nukes, no lost loot, etc.
---
Just the fact that there *are* one shot builds makes it a bad pvp. I’m hoping that one of the coming new modes on the roadmap has a battle royals mode where people drop in with the same level characters and a limited number of perk cards and have to hunt each other down
---
Gulpers? That’s even more confusing. That can’t be true, I’ve never seen a deathclaw hide from a Gulper. In fact creatures don’t drop other creatures “parts” so that must be wrong.
---
I’ve moved my camp several times, and I still remember their locations and in what order they were. Seeing a big tent, possibly in a circle if you have a shop, is one of the easier parts of the game.
---
I'm glad they did the content though.  But yea, fix them bugs.
---
The thing about things you think of as mandatory is that 90% of the games that have it probably never started with it. Gaming is not a upward slope, what one developers includes isn't automatically listed as absolute by other developers and more importantly, isn't immediately figured out, easy to replicate and cheap to figure out. Especially with ESO, a large amount of the even basic functions it has took *years* of constant updates and revenue to be added in, which is typical for MMOS with frequent quality of life updates, so even with them, you can't really point them out as example of what EVERY game needs, because they sure as hell survived without those features
---
Yeah I've got an object one right out front my house by accident. Came home once and there was a crashed Vertibird right on my doorstep
---
I completely agree. My camp is near the Overseer’s on the road. Nice scenery, in the no-nuke zone...and sometimes I have to hop 6-10 times just to have it. It used to be not much of a big deal when I was playing with friends, since we all have ours close to each other, but now it means my business is closed for the day.
---
Froggy Mart
---
FNV had a good amount of that. The bumper sword, the marked men armor, legion armor, nuka cola sign, ED-E, etc. The metal armor looked much more "apocalyptic" in 1/2/3/nv than it does in 4/76. The chinese assault rifle and chinese pistol in 3 also looked very worn. We need more of that
---
A few data mines plus there that customization slot so there has to be something right, RIGHT?!?!. Idk if they actually are but I wanted to make this post as my last chance. Cause the event is cancer without enough/experienced people. I hate saying experienced since it's a simple freaking mechanic but what ya gonna do?
---
Lol. I inferred it to mean the gulpers ate them. But that makes even less sense than them dropping them for no reason.
---
I found that the weapon drops I got defined what I had to do with my build.
---
I like to play sniper/rifle builds ... it's my play style ... but I have never once gotten a decent rifle drop.  At level 50, I had to change to melee due to the drops, then to heavy weapons at about level 100, again due to the weapons i actually had.
---
I'm at level 210 and still waiting to build the character I want to have .....
---
It’s been stated that Nuclear Winter won’t be talked about until E3 by Bethesda themselves.
---
Yeah, I said this a while ago. I got downvoted lol. But a person can dream, right?
---
Looking for Deathclaw hides. Are there any just laying around?
---
Yeah Morgantown is a good place to nuke that always gets overlooked.
---
People are helpful a lot on fallout 76
---
Fuck the skins, I want the mosaic tile floors.
---
Some of the things to do like Archery challenges and Athletics races, very few of us would have found them without checking the location on google, so directions for them would be nice
---
Also wrapped cap has been bugged since launch. Not being able to wear any face wear with it while in FO4 you could.
---
Small thing but still.
---
Spread out a bit. Weapons are both level and area based. In example at level 14 supermutants will have hunting rifles and short auto pipe rifles at the penitentiary, higher levels the hunting rifles will be exchanged for charged laser snipers. 
---
Frankly the hunting rifle was pretty damn good. I still use them and considering the only other weapon that uses 308 is the hungry MG42 and the bolt action pipe. Just unlock more mods and swap out for the next level when possible.
---
The Royal Jelly at Middle Mountain Cabins is the only one that is an 'Aid' item. The other two are 'junk 'items and are not used for recipes.
---
&gt;mods that add new content
---
Wild Appalachia: Am I a joke to you?
---
Butcher's Bounty Lvl 3 + Woodchuck make the majority of my caps from vendors.  I'm set up nearby a deathclaw spawn, but glowing meat is still the most valuable and abundant meat you'll find all over Appalachia from all types of glowing critters.  From there, I sell mostly unused aid items that drop/generate frequently like extra water, Rad-X and Radaways.  If I don't have many expendable aid items, I pick up ordinary weapons from Super Mutants and Scorched.  I also recently discovered that the Scrapper perk is well worth the single card when you're short on steel; ~20 steel from assault rifles and heavier weapons.
---
You can't see them too well most of the time because they're smaller than the height of the grass. Use vats regularly when wandering, that's how I found one. You can kill it and take a picture of its body as well; that counts towards the challenge
---
Modding it with welded (help me with radiation), and it works properly!
---
As players, we can't complain about what works ..... every time we do, Bethesda Nerfs the quality items/play styles instead of doing anything to really balance the game.
---
I don't think they drop Legendary items but it's likely randomized. The three pack leaders are guaranteed though
---
Hilarious that you are lecturing on how people can make more friends hahah. You dont make more friends by sending people multiple messages trying to get THEIR items and then telling them they are asking for too much much for THEIR items.  It's his so it's worth whatever he says it is TO HIM. That's how it works and there are literally thousands of players every single day that are more than willing to pay those prices. I sold 2 guns that were both 2* today and both were close to 3,000 caps. There are entire sites dedicated to selling items for caps online and 2,000 plus is usually the starting  point. Loosen the purse strings there scrooge mcduck, if you want it buy it. If you're too cheap to buy it move along no one cares about your sob story.
---
Never play the Encryptid event then.  Keep your unsullied, idealistic perception of the FO76 community.
---
I had a problem with putting a roof on my second floor above my stairs. So I just messed with it a little until it worked. Then I put the stairs back the way I wanted.
---
It absolutely does. There's a good chance that it can spawn in ***ALL*** "Travel"-type locations in The Forest!  I've confirmed 4 locations so far: 
---
https://i.imgur.com/BHDTwz1.jpg
---
People are even pretty great in survival. Me and a dude were killing each other off and on for half an hour. I was running out of aid items so I ducked out from the battle. A few minutes later we both fast traveled to WS station to drop loot/ sell stuff. We both stared at each other for a few seconds then did the wave emote. He dropped me some stims and I dropped him 150 rounds of .45 ammo. Waved and went our separate ways. I know there are trolls and spawn campers and such, but I'm glad there are still civil and nice people everywhere.
---
I dream about getting down voted and it usually always comes true 😂
---
Right?
---
Why do level 5 noobs try to trade with me? Just irritates me
---
I would just be happy if we could scrip right up to max 150 each day, regardless of what we scrap in the machine.
---
i.e. if you have 39 scrip left on your account and a \*\*\* crap weapon (worth 40 scrip), let us scrap it and get the 39 scrip.  Sure we loose a scrip or two, but we don't have to do perfect math to get max scrip each day.
---
So many crappy legendaries in the game, not enough place to get rid of them ... and no one is buying one star items from the vending machines, even at 25 cap charges for Bloodied, or AA items.
---
God, I hate when Windows runs that program in the background that saps 90% of the CPU processing and when you look up what it is online, it's something dumb and unavoidable like some process keeping you connected to the network.
---
I'm right there with ya.
---
Geez, you'd even let me pick WHERE!
---
The straight jackets from the hospital/asylum sell for 46 caps with rank 3 vendor perk, very sexy!
---
Yep, i ended up just scraping my jukebox to avoid the bad music
---
I think we should be able to write entries in it
---
&gt;It's less of an issue with the form the NPCs take and more about how there is no dialogue trees or choice at all. You just click on them. Hear what they have to say and go on to the next automated checkpoint.
---
In the context of Fallout games the lack of NPCs with dialog trees seems strange, but look at other MMOs (which let's face it, 76 is a MMO of sorts). 99% of the npcs you met in WoW, ESO, FF15, etc are the same way. You talk to them, they give you a mission, you complete the mission and return to them for a reward.
---
Occasionally there will be a "choice" that boils down to "Hey, I heard you were doing X for Ygritte. Bring the widget to me instead, and I'll reward you with Y rather than the Z she's offering." Sure, it's a "choice", but at the end of the day it has almost no impact on anything other than being a slightly different reward or maybe impacting your "karma" or "rep" or whatever.
---
At the end of the day, MMOs can't have persistent, game allowing choices, because that whittle fuck things up for the next person that comes along. That's why this whole "OMG! No npcs!!!" argument has annoyed the fuck out of me since day one.
---
Its not that people are done with it it's just a lot of people are having so many issues crashing and freezing with it a lot including me are waiting on bethesda to fix it.
---
I struggled at the beginning too, I teamed up if I had to
---
Man they all run from me... wish one would stand its ground just once
---
[removed]
---
Same with the teddy bears.
---
I’ll buy that, what u looking for?
---
Nah they will dissaper if you relog
---
And he’s finally gone. 3 hour timer?
---
I got it just to pair it with my Fasnacht giant mask to role play as a supermutant.
---
True. That’s why I price everything fairly cheap to move it out. I am holding on to some hard to get legendaries that I’ve been sitting on for a long time. I’ve got around 500hrs in and I know what’s hard to find. Not giving it away, yet if I price it what I value it, it’s gonna blow my bank.
---
I guess I should just drop the 3 star instigating deathclaw gauntlet and AAE handmades off in the Overseer’s Camp.
---
Day 109: much has changed since my first time coming out of the vault. I have managed to get some supplies today at the super duper Mart but was ambushed by super mutants wanting to shop for me.
---
Mine won't even plug in. I can't connect a wire to it.
---
Pick it up, see what differences the game has made for your build. Weapons and perks and alot has changed since then, so it might positively or negatively change your playstyle.  Grind a few levels and see if it still feels right. If not, start again!
---
Shhhhh stop telling people it's a horrible event that you shouldn't try your only gonna get trash. COUGH COUGH LVL 15 TSE Handmade I got for my new character.
---
I guess I'll keep grinding events down there
---
I’d try to sell it first. Probably get something in the 3k range.
---
I literally built my camp to be a SkyMaze with an obstacle course, climbing wall, and jumping puzzle where if you fall you die. The vendor is at the end and I sell pretty much crap and magazines and bobbleheads. Sorry bud!
---
Cool- thanks for the offer! Ended up picking one up a few days ago.
---
Thanks for the team up I hope I was able to help
---
Use a code lock switch instead
---
That’s a 15 to 25k gun on PS4
---
Are you locking them? If not random people will take it all?
---
Sneak. I had to pick up an item at WhiteSprings cabins. I had to creep past a bunch of high level charred ghouls.
---
Thick skin bro. Report it or dont. Move on. You twelve?
---
The fastest melee weapons that aren't continuous attacks are the bowie knife, combat knife, switchblade, and cultist dagger. All of them are listed as fast swing speed. Idk if there is any individual variation among them
---
I'm with the majority in that I fix their torrents and occasionally drop weapons and armor that I will never use as a show of thanks, especially if they sold something I really wanted.  :-)
---
Wipe your feet before u enter.
---
I can not get this to work either there is no option to collect blood. This game is so broken it is not even funny.
---
I don't use door anymore because of this, and camp limit.
---
Me too. I just buy them.
---
That sucks a lot. Time to pick a new spot?
---
No it doesnt tell you
---
That's why you do a bloodied stealth build - despite me being at less than 20% health all the time (to get nerd rage activated), I almost never get hit, which means I don't need to worry about it. I do die once in a while if I get detected by moving too close to enemies or if enemies just shoot at the place where they think I am, but stealth builds are very good when combined with bloodied cause you get sneak attack criticals **with** bloodied.
---
What are those hub's motivations? What is protecting them from SBs before you come along? Where do you see an opportunity for player agency that won't fuck things up for the next person?
---
Classic example: Megaton. A place with a choice like that can't exist in 76, because if I choose to donate the bomb it eliminates that choice for the next player who wanders through.
---
Haha right? I can’t imagine gulpers would be actually eating deathclaws, they seem lower on the food chain.  Unless they are scavenging dead bodies
---
I got my backpack, no other interesting rewards imo.
---
It is a fun event and the location is tight but it's near impossible to win it without a ton of other endgame players.
---
Last two updates i’ve had to do a complete reinstall its stupid.
---
I got three .308 rounds and a spatula from a lv 68 \*\*\* Legendary Charred Ghoul .... I was stoked.
---
Theres 2 at thw Alice in wonderland table! Just east of the farris wheel on the ridge!
---
Yeah bloodied builds are so OP
---
Yeah, I was getting to that point, too LOL
---
Why do you stick around if you like where your camp is though? (Not trying to sound mean) If you don't use a mobile camp, why aren't you changing servers right away? Just because I do every time for that exact reason...
---
Why cant I revive someone in the water?!?!!? Driving me nuts!
---
That deserves it's own PSA.  Way easier to kill things like radtoads, deathclaws and snallys first
---
Yeah it's because you probs don't have any good unyielding armor with high protection - I use high protection chameleon armor with my bloodied stealth commando build and even if i get hit by high level enemies I don't die
---
As dumb as this sounds, no I forgot.  This may be a significant factor.  Thanks
---
Have set if x01 legs for sale. Xbox. $2000 caps each in my vendor shop.
---
yeah
---
Sure does sound nice. Gonna have to probably rely on reddit for that for a long while though. 😕
---
Make sure you are running fullscreen. I have similar specs with a 1070 and my framerate drops by half in borderless window mode.
---
Yeah if bethesda nerfs bloodied builds my bloodied stealth commando build is pointless
---
what mods are there? get them from scrapping?
---
Oh hell that's op
---
lol someone came in a downvoted everything. Thank you!
---
I figured this was the case but was curious if I missed something.
---
ESOs character creator was great for this. The graphical quality holds it back but iirc you can toggle thickness of each limb possibly even down to upper arm, forearm etc. So many little things I wish they carried over into 76 that would have complemented the game nicely.
---
Ha I was there too.
---
You did!
---
It's apparently a rare reward for all 3 subject survivability ng so.... Yeah
---
Good luck. I wish we could have this implemented soon.
---
Fyi, bug if you decide to stick around when camp is taken.

     Heh that’s funny last guy that was a d!ck to me took my junk that I dropped in white springs. I emoted that I was mad then got on the mic and told him I needed the junk. Wasn’t thinking when I went in to the nuke zone and died from rads. I am a low hp build. So he taunted me and of course I followed him like a noob and killed everything that popped up of course like a noob I died again lol he took my sh!t again. 
---
   At this point I am thinking some next level sh!t. I found his house. I cannot destroy houses they are now indestructible. So without going into detail what I did, when I walked away from his house his 2 reactors his 8 small water purifiers and all his vendor units and all the walls were destroyed. Good thing a friend was on that met the insult bot. She was nice enough to leave on his cement slab.” You have been insulted”. I know what he took from me wasn’t worth as much as what it was going to take to repair everything.

Same buddy. All the luck to ya!
---
&gt; I love open world RPG games such as the Fallout series and Skyrim series because I enjoy killing random NPCS
---
This is not an "open world (single player) RPG", it's a living, breathing world populated by other humans. This is the key thing you "Reee! No npcs!" people don't get. 
---
Go pick up any online multilayer game and tell me how many "random npcs" you can kill. The answer is likely to be zero, because those npcs need to be there for the next person to interact with. 
---
If you want that environment, great! Go back to a modded out version of FO3 where you can kill anything and everything, including children and puppies. If you want an online game where other players are interacting in the same instanced world you have to accept that this isn't an option.
---
Cool, I'm on right now
---
I have 2 bloodied LMG’s and they are a blast. Ammo hogs but fun.
---
I wonder if this is some sort of social experiment.
---
'How many times are these players prepared to fail the event for the sake of killing a bullet sponge that has no chance of better loot than your garden variety max lvl 3* mob'.

Yes please, Bethsheda.

I would've done the same as you, lol.

Some people, smh

Gee... hold on, wouldn't a bloodied gauss rifle do more damage when you're a low health? Say you're at 20% health, right, you get 80% damage bonus if the weapon you're using is bloodied, which is definitely gonna be more than a gauss rifle with the instigating effect. If you're at 10% health, you get 90% damage bonus. Instigating doesn't have that - it only does double damage if the target is at full health. Besides, bloodied has many many upgrades to it, such as nerd rage and adrenal reaction - once again, instigating doesn't have that. 
---
I just think that a bloodied version of a weapon is better than an instigating effect on the weapon.
---
It's appreciated
---
maybe you really are Josiah and the poor guy is just trying to reconnect with his son?
---
It really is. Chainsaw, Buzz Blade and Drill are trash once more. why would they do this?
---
that's true
---
[deleted]
---
That’s what I was thinking too.... or it’s just a stupid bug. Lol
---
&gt;This is just a Placebo .... nothing we do has any impact on the drop.  The drop is determined by Bethesda's specialized RNG algorithms that have bugs because they are using optimizers that are intended to keep people playing, not give them a truly random drop with real probability numbers.
---
This will get abused.
---
Over the last week or so I've killed 30 or 40 deathclaws nothing from one of them. Also killed 11 or 12 scorchbeasts not 1 dropped meat. Also kinda funny killed 2 mothman neither 1 dropped a wing. 
---
It seems as bugthesda hit again. Make quests requiring specific items but bug the characters that drop them.
---
Not looking to rob anyone, most of the feedback I got said between 7 to 10 k.  7000 wold be nice to get.  Lemme know
---
Good points. The basement shutdown code can be dangerous if you don’t have a large group though. I’ve tried it twice now with 5 or less people. The friendlies ended up kamikazing themselves and we failed both times.
---
I've been playing since the Beta. Lol. But I mean I never server hopped for them. I just always ended up on a server where one would launch
---
Sure why not been wanting one of these. My gamertag is RicknKy17, you join me?
---
Nope. XB1

Best I can do for now:

I'll try to get them all in a more reader-friendly and organized list in the near future!
---
I'm in on the timers.  Both for the Vendors and the Legendary Scripper.
---
Yup. Even though you're being a douche I'll let you pick the drop zone.
---
Seriously though, I still see plenty of nukes beyond the ones I drop. I got on this morning and someone had nuked Whitesprings. A couple hours later the same guy nukes the Cola factory as a test.
---
 People are launching constantly, and if you aren't finding them you "need to be the change you wish to see in the world" and launch your own fucking nukes. It's not hard to collect a key card and run through a silo.
---
Have you ever played ESO? I though an MMO with choices and consequences would be impossible as well but to my surprise ESO does just this. You can support certain factions that will effect your own storyline along the way. You can also attack NPCs but risk getting a bounty on your head and not to mention be attacked by any and every guard under that flag. As for the SB, that's where interior hubs come in such as Rivet City or Underworld. The main purpose is to use these places as quest givers, lore dumps and to be honest, add more life to the game. There are so many interesting locations in 76 that honestly don't have much value after a first visit. Let's give those locations meaning by having human/ghoul quest givers send us there for a purpose rather than a robot.
---
At least in fallout 4, it seems like there was variation between weapons. Seems like "fast" refers to anything with more than two swings per second
---
You did the Hunter challenge or the Chemist challenge?
---
I suggested this a while back and it would
---
Are you running in full screen or windowed mode? Have you tried disabling the grass to see if your performance improves (\[Grass\] bAllowCreateGrass = 0)? If you are going to customize the INI be sure to do it in a new one named Fallout76Custom.ini to prevent it from being overwritten (I didn't see you mention this so just FYI). You definitely have something weird going on because my hardware is slower than yours but my performance is better and I don't experienced stuttering at all.
---
Or I could join you just need your GT
---
As long as you don't place your camp again before that happens, when you try to fast travel once the spot is reopened, you'll notice your camp marker is back. Or if you accidentally do stay on the server and want to go to camp right away, it'll be in the same spot if the next server allows and you didn't try to place it.
---
You always know there's pvp involved if you don't move in a risky manner. I don't enjoy that because its not how my time on survival looks like.
---
I'm waiting for better stability before I try it again.
---
I should be on in a few.  Will join you
---
Okay sounds good man. Thank you
---
The SS Combat knife goes pretty freakin fast, but maybe the cultist or Bowie has a variation
---
If still interested I have both legs of X01 armor with calibrated shocks. 2000 each. Gamertag is same as my name here.
---
I didn't know ESO had this! Why wouldn't they include this in fallout?
---
This is utterly brilliant!!!
---
Level 72. Never launched a nuke. Just entered the Whitespring bunker yesterday. I build my camp and wonder around junking and collecting a lot of the time. Just dinking around. Having fun in my own way. Love player vendors and walk to nearby ones and find things I don’t have. I’m pretty sure I’m playing an old woman garage sale patron simulator.
---
I'd like the content I can't complete because of bugs to be fixed so I can complete it ..... that would keep me from getting bored. ...... or so frustrated I quit playing.
---
This happened to me but a little different. The first day player vending came out, I put my machines up and was getting customers. Then, I switched servers and ended up finding one where my camp spot was taken, so of course, I searched for a new world. 
---
Once I found a new world, it was completely gone. I would log out and back in. It never told me again that my camp spot was taken and I also went to the spot my camp was in and no one was around that area. When I would go into my pip boy it said I could place my camp without paying any caps. Such a weird experience
---
*think*
---
Did you find one? I have an extra I'll give you for free :)
---
🤔
---
Chances are that a mule/alt will have a ton of crap in their vendors, and you can see that before traveling. This change would more likely effect lower level players who have way fewer items in their vendors.
---
There are a couple listed as very fast, but IIRC the damage is really low per swing,  buzz blade comes to mind for some reason,
---
Personally, usually alternate between a L45 cultist dagger and a L50 vampire switchblade - modded for serrated.
---
So use them back so they can't vats you.
---
I just started looking and if I can't find it in a hour I'll take you up on that offer. :)
---
Well something like this would require some serious technical fuckery to implement.
---
Take the screenshot, convert it into a texture that the engine can 'understand' and load it to an activator of some description all in real time.
---
I would love something like this for when we finally get private servers, oh the possibilities!
---
Yeah this is super annoying. Honestly the entire build system is annoying and I'll never understand why it needs to be so restricted.
---
I'll try fullscreen again but I didn't think it did anything for me.
---
Its a risk reward. I dont pvp but i take workshops all the time. Sometimes i get blasted... Other times i get to hold down 3 of them and its full-time job hoping from one to the other. Its almost a relief after hrs of defending em (and tonz of loot) 
---
Im a low lvl so its a mixed bag... Half the time people come to help and it turns in to 2 or 3 of us vs 1 guy.
---
Other times i get blasted and just walk away for a while. 
---
As a low lvl the workshops are fine. Its pvp thats the problem.higher the lvl more likely you will win. Only time i win is if they are running bloodied. With my low health pool it makes no difference if i get shot. But it does leave them open to fragmines or vats rifle. Very satisfying to kill a triple diget cause he didnt have fireproof and i ran away laying mines 😁
---
You know if a switchblade swings faster than a Combat knife?
---
Try it and see for yourself. You can level somewhat faster but lose caps if your gear and skills not up to par. A unique weapon under the challenges can only be acquired in that mode.
---
One a day limit.  One a week limit.
---
Why not have a list of stuff available?  That way you don't waste $$ traveling to find out they don't have anything I an looking for.
---
I have played ESO, and while factions and individual story arcs would be awesome, it doesn't negate my previous comment. ESO provides some "personal choice" in the form of factions and whatnot, but none of it impacts the rest of the world, and your choice to join a faction doesn't alter my playing.
---
At the end of the day, npcs in ESO are really no better/different than the ones in 76, other than that they are elves or khajit instead of robots or mole miners. It's basically "go here, do this, come back for a reward."
---
Sometimes i Just like to see what other player vendors have, check random spawn locations for rare stuff still...etc.
---
Np :)
---
hm, guess I'll be server hopping till it's fixed.
---
Map screen challenges.  Scroll down World and see the actual merit badges on the right.
---
Yes apperntly mole rats and rad rats have opposable thumbs because i have seen both of these open doors.
---
Speed Demon doesn't stack with Gun Runner.
---
Yeah you can get any mod; so I usually craft arms to scrap bc those are the lowest cost
---
Heavy metal armor, deathclaw gauntlet, gatling gun
---
That’s a valuable roll. Right buyer might give you 15k.
---
Alright I was mad confused ty
---
No with class freak it doesn't work it's broken instead of 20% of food and water it's still 50%(what I mean is the negative affect)
---
I'll honestly settle for the Dane's Brothers Compound version
---
Omg only a gamer! Luv it
---
Sounds like there are benefits... I'll try it out when I finish these few quests with the sheepsquatch I'm currently working on.
---
I still regularly crash when using items from Pip-Boy.
---
I completely understand. I bought the plan because I was sick of hopping. I've found only 3. 2 are on my lower level one in my stash. So it sounds like my price might be ok. It uses 5 flux after all and a lot of other mats to craft. Thanks.
---
I mean it really just comes down to luck in the end anyway. Either way works, but I feel like there's more opportunity to get it by going to more places per server.
---
Stealth rifleman.
---
make low level ones and scrap em.. got serrated and stealth by doing that.
---
I've been wanting to get a large group to get together and go down at the same time. It'd be cool to go down with 10 or so ppl

No. Assassins and bolstering are both primary effects. Effects are broken down into primary, secondary, and tertiary types. Fall damage is tertiary.

I can make you a handmade on PS4 later if you like. Level 15
---
I disagree they just need to make a category for legendary that way we can stop going to look at weapons and find normal stuff.

They were legendary you just can't see it because the diseased name overwrites it for some reason. Been that way since the beginning.

*high fives* Me to!

You lucky bastard, what the hell am I doing wrong that your setup is smoother then mine. I've gotta figure this out.

I'll try using fullscreen again but I don't think that did anything. I don't see how disabling the grass would help me, I've tried lowering it and that had no effect so I just keep it low but could have it on high. Even GeForce says I can max everything so I have no idea.
---
I did notice that the game uses maybe 60% of my gpu so maybe that could be something I'll look into.

Thanks for your help though.

I have seen the text in the UI (saying 50% no matter whether you equip Class Freak or not) bu I have never done the experiment of comparing the hunger/thirst 'rates' with and without the perk equipped.

So at this point I'm unsure whether is broken or just a UI glitch.

How do you feel about death threats?  I ask because I got one in game, was able to record it, and reported it.  Am I wrong?  Should people with shitty attitudes and actions at least face some consequences for their behavior?
---
Thanks, but it’s not the size of the casing that matters, but the power of the load...
---
hahaha
---
I've noticed sometimes it doesn't work when reloading...reload slow as fuck...
---
Especially in Power Armor but not exclusively
---
I know since the last update I go through food way faster, and today I was moving way slower than usual too so I was thinking it was messed up myself
---
20% more exp. imo not really worth it, given how much more time and resources you'll waste sneaking around and fighting players and respawning due to fights with players
---
Pro tip: If it ever dashboards you as you enter the elevator just load back in fast travel to other nearby location ie Greg's mine supply and run to your elevator (not too fast tho you speed demon😉) then you will load in correctly.
---
No it is me my dad have tested it

https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects

One per category
---
I haven't even attempted it yet. I'm perpetually over encumbered so I can't fast travel there when it pops up and even if I could it doesn't look like the type of event it would be a good idea to attempt while over encumbered.
---
If you are on Xbox I’ll buy any duplicates for caps or trade resources for them... really want that bear arm plan...
---
There's Serrated and Stealth.  I think you can buy the mods, but I learned them just by scrapping the knives.
---
A Vampire Combat Knife is a pretty convenient thing to have.  I don't really do one-handed weapons anymore, but back when I did, it was the 2nd go-to weapon for me.
---
It's fun if you like pvp
---
Maybe you gotta point after the last update I dunno maybe they just screwed it even more
---
I find it goes best with the mistress of mystery outfit (If your making a sneak build.)
---
I used rifles + deathclaw gauntlet until I figured out legendary stuff
---
But isn't that the point? You're decisions impact YOUR story. You don't play for everyone else. You play for the benefit of your own character. As for impacting the rest of the world since you've played ESO you may recall how they've address that to a degree. For example, if you clear out that storyline with the vampires taking over that village the next time you venture in there it's now populated with normal folk, shopkeepers and faction merchants. The environment changes depending on what you the player has accomplished or path you've decided and the world reflects that despite being an MMO. 
---
Now if you want to get technical, strip away all the flair and voice acting and EVERY game is a "go there, do this, come back for a reward" version of those before them.
---
My current build.
---
“Mutant Waster”
---
I basically just beat the #### out of everything while wearing standard armor, and have a lot of natural DR.
---
Bottom right hand corner of the map there is the prime fissure site.  Launch a nuke at that and she sows up.
---
 I have a Nocturnal 40% Speed Serrated Combat Knife and its hitting a few times a second. It gets into the 200+ Damage quickly with a few kills.
---
Anecdotally, after day one, I definitely haven't seen a huge demand for this event.  It seems to sit without any takers for quite a while.  And it doesn't surprise me - it's such a kitchen sink of activities all thrown at you so quickly, and it's very easy to fail it simply by being overwhelmed.
---
What did it say?
---
I'm going to start with (and yeah its odd) I don't know what game you/we/collectively we are discussing here because for whatever (bizarre) reason this post up, showed with no context, in my Google Feed and I just randomly read it. But, Invincible players in pvp have existed for as long as pvp mode itself has! In original Destiny year 1 for ex. it was the infamous "lag switch" jerks were purchasing online to gain lead. (If you haven't heard of the incredibly irritating lag switch I encourage a search. Simply bc it shows what lengths the bad apples are willing to go through to win easy. Devs couldn't "just patch" a darn thing, it wasn't in the code at all, it's an actual device loosers love!
---
Be sure to stash the meds and junk you don’t want lose.
---
Keep going. There aren't any changes the the early quests. Any new quests will still show up for you, just check posters at a train station. You won't be losing out on anything by continuing, but you will lose quite some time's worth of progression if you already got to rose on your old character and start a new one
---
For real.
---
You can't just save pts and spend them. You have to spend points to unlock more perks.
---
What I did was hang around white springs golf course with a sniper when other players were around to do all the heavy damage
---
Your suggestion about entering the code to regenerate the animal health is nice, but the unintended consequence is when you have just one animal left, and the alpha spawns in the room with the last remaining animal, and the last remaining animal then goes to fight the alpha and promptly dies, thus failing the event. I’ve seen this happen several times. 
---
So just be aware that using the code can give you the benefits through the event and ruin you in the end.
---
Melee/unarmed in Power Armor. No regular armor needed at all so no legendries. Then pick whatever weapon you want to use with it.
---
It's not really about playing "offline" it's just I want to play with my friends with mods, a thing that Bethesda said was coming in the first place (also a lot of people aren't happy with the state of the game, mods if added would make the game much better than the developers could even dream of making it.
---
There are letters but they take up massive amounts of camp budget. So annoying. I deleted all my letters, I could have had 3 extra turrets. I only had like 10 words.
---
Caps
---
Happens daily in games like Team Fortress 2
---
Neiither did I but I had 2 level 7's hitting me. I brought out a missle launcher (this was shortly after the beta) to scare them off. It worked on one but the other continued. I decided that if he attacked me after I turned off passive he was done, it wasn't my fault he went into his pipboy immediately after.
---
I’ve only heard that happening to pc guys with outdated mods and ini files.
---
Last update has messed a few things up like that. I get damage returning to ghouls in nuke zones, two now, to the point that they are essentially immortal. Explosive and energy both. I’ve seen a few people mention similar. 
---
That and the endless plasma core spawns in inventory
---
Beta player here too. Just reached level 50 on my original character. I just do my own thing. I need friends :( it's getting boring and I tried recruiting my 13 year old daughter. She was like 'oh it's Sims with guns'... I almost grounded her for the rest of her life.
---
Don't care, grow some thicker skin dude.
---
Just replace it. It should be free. Sometimes you have to start from scratch depending on how complex your camp was though.
---
Hmm. Haven't heard that one yet
---
Exactly the tracking feature as it is now is completely useless
---
Many high level players myself included are tired of randoms stealing kills and stuff. No point to going through all that work to have everybody barging in on it.
---
when you enter power armor switch weapons, it will work again until you exit your power armor
---
Caves, cemetery, and Camden’s carnival place
---
At least I can stab with the bayonet on my black powder rifle.
---
Yes! It drives me crazy when all my doors are open. But it’s even worse when people turn your lights off. They can’t destroy your base so they turn the lights out.
---
Sometimes mine dosent work at all....no reload speed....and as someone mentioned above, ive also had problems with enemys regaining health as im shooting them recently
---
Wait, are you saying the code makes the defense targets hostile? I thought it was random whether they fled from combat or fought? I could swear I have seen them run after using the code. And the low-level ones almost always flee. I thought it had more to do with their tier...?
---
It does, but it takes a minute to start playing the music. Probably because it’s loading the song that the radio is playing bc all radios are synced
---
Hmm.
---
Heaps of useful junk at arkos pharmacy dungeon and grab a fusion core off a sentry bot there too each hop. Got a bear head mele weapon as reward, cool. The event is great if people show up. [P.] Refractor and [E.] Fireproof perk cards help against assaultron damage?
---
I'm lvl 124. I can take you under my wing and get you some level ups
---
I'll be on later GT: Dr Fischer MD
---
I've tried the event with a friend both over lvl 100 and it's just impossible, I get the burrows were pathetic but this is just a joke. Every time I trigger the event NO one joins NO one. Give us a fight that we can enjoy and remember Bethesda not a wow raid!
---
Could give an actual purpose for the tommy gun
---
Server hopped for 2 days.... rotating through the tea pot, lighthouse and fairgrounds. Nothing....not a thing. Server hopped 2 times at the water park.....bingo.
---
Level 110. Haven’t launched a nuke nor did anything past Rosie’s mission. Haven’t started hw brotherhood quest line. There’s just a lot of marching around and getting plans and building camps and having fun to worry about missions. Plus the fasnacht, camera, and ever upwards are a fun kind of grind (when not bugged).

Absolutely report them and try to make sure you get an actual human confirmation that they're at least looking into it so you can provide more evidence to them if needed, but please don't post them here or send them privately to people through here. We don't need that crap any more prevelant than it already is, it could lead to a nasty witch hunt, and it gives news media material to be exploited that could unfairly damage the game and community. Whoever did this is a piece of shit and feel free to explain more on what exactly was shown if you feel so inclined, but sharing pics of it will only lead to more hate, in whatever way it naturally materializes, out of your control.

But what about things like the mole miners gauntlet and power fist?
---
Nope
---
Maybe bacause its a little extra to load in? My body barely spawns in anymore. I know its a small thing but remember theres 20+ other people
---
Wait a second... there's plans for the fixer to be level 50? I think I missed something
---
Yeah plans drop from the imposter sheepsquatch
---
What I am saying is that by entering the code that regenerates them, it also causes the animals you are defending to start helping fight any enemies that are spawned in the room. This includes the alpha. Try it next time and watch. If you’re with a ghoul or Yao Guai or some bigger animal, watch them help you fight the spawned enemies.
---
Formula P heals the creatures needed to be protected during phase 2 of the event.
---
I wish, i hard crash during the event :(
---
So tired of the Whitespring. Anything for a change.
---
I may nuke Charleston next.
---
Wish I saw this before, I just ended up building up the entire room by one level and slapping the roofs on afterwards
---
Not trying to cause problems so you drop some unsubstantiated gossip on the subreddit. Ok....
---
Discord is pretty easy to set up but the question then becomes "why?" I don't know of a way to be a raider in game that isn't just running around snacking at people in adventure then having your buddy gun them down if they care retaliate out of annoyance.
---
Well... thank you. I'm officially in the know... might actually trigger the event now for once
---
The people who make this game do not play it. If they do, they only do it during work hours when they are testing something out. And they only test it out for a little bit. They don't KNOW to try things that players would do because they AREN'T PLAYERS. 
---
They do NOT take pride in their work and they don't LIKE the products they produce. They aren't gamers.
---
Yes. Given you can choose at least the type and guarantee a 3 star (or 2 if you are more frugal) ... yes.
---
thanks for this
---
the revived must be standing, not swimming. they must be able to pull out their weapon as if they are fighting. otherwise they just die
---
dang. okay. appreciate it.
---
sounds good
---
oh lawd, oh nawhh
---
Ah you're gonna hate this but they have to be only kneedeep in water or less, you can't enter a downed state whilst swimming basically. Give it another go!
---
Yeah the charging shotgun is great for non-VATs ... is just happens that my 3 best are all VATS based (esp. the Medics).
---
that sounds like hell, but I'm still under level 50 so I might try it out.
---
Not sure if this is a solve all, but two things you could try are 1.) Placing the roofs after you slap down whatever you want, or 2.) Making the entire room one level higher with another level of walls.

Hmmm....I'll have to check that out. I'll do a few events and if I am satisfied that it isn't at random or just the larger enemies that attack, I'll make an edit to the post. Thanks for bringing this up!
---
Same, I’ve always been a stealth player in Bethesda games
---
Well that's a bummer.
---
I’ve heard of some issues with bugs in the silos, could be preventing the nukes to launch.

I think its a creation engine thing, i think they redid the entire mechanic for combat and it may not be appliable w/o substantial strain on the game.. just a thought idk tho
---
PS... its worth every minute
---
Explosive handmade or explosive laser
---
&gt; PLEASE DON'T join the event with your level 7 or 39 or any other stupidly low level character. You don't have the gear. You will be more of a liability than an asset. Not being mean, but you won't be winning the event either. At such a low level there are surely MANY lower-level events you haven't completed yet. Go do them, and come back after LVL 50.
---
​Speak for yourself, my 35 toon is twinked af with bloodied weapons and a nice modded PA set. It's not that much weaker than your common perk/special capped toon. I just don't play it often.
---
Mine works off and on very odd
---
NSFW?
---
update your custom.ini file
---
Ahhahaaha😅👊that's epic!!!
---
There are little a and b buttons on the box, so pressing those while looking at it should change the song
---
IT JUST WORKS!!!!!
---
Tried to use a Bloodied Explosive Laser Rifle the damage seens very low on her (but is very right on everything else)
---
3 star armor only and get them when you have 60+ left to script so you can rescript the duds
---

---
Sorry to hear that I have a similar issue  when ever I log out all the items in my vending machine vanish started after a crash.
---
Three times, I've done the event 3 times and succeeded twice. I've only done the event three times because I realized very quickly how unlikely it is to succeed consistently without a solid group.
---
Probably a handmade with a bloodied or crit focused build (or both). Primed receiver/Zealots/Hunters legendary will help also. But if you're not doing heavy weapons or melee you're probably better off helping clear the adds during a queen fight. Keep shit off the heavy gunners so they can get dps on the queen.
---
Jump fro. The Charleston herald he, the suspension bridge. Both parties must be in water.
---
It's not just you me and my friend noticed that after the recents updates when we go to areas like glassed caverns or arkhos pharma they stutter so bad they are unplayable
---
If you're a stealth sniper. You perks are all in rifleman, so your best dps without redoing all your perks/perk cards is a railway rifle. It uses rifleman perks, has a high dmg per shot, generally fast fire and high capacity mag.
---
The problem is ammo. Railway stakes are heavy and take alot of metal to make, you get some back from looting enemies, but you don't seem to get back as much as you shoot from the queen. She takes alot of shots so I tend to run out of ammo during the fight
---
Took everything off, put on only two different +25 RR legendarys.  Took the same amount of rads from pump water.  Also nothing anywhere showed the RR, stats, on the pieces, etc.
---
I did see a +25 RR piece in someones vending machine tonight and it did show the +25 RR in the stats for the item so maybe it really is only some items being bugged.
---
It's called a trap for a reason. Y'all must have never played Rust before. There's an entire subset of people who only build trap bases. Number one rule is be suspicious of everyone
---
Get enforcer on and target her wings... if you can keep her crippled she will stay in the ground and melee can go to town. 
---
As a fellow rifleman, I do this and work crowd control, keeping the mobs off the tanks so they can focus on the SBQ.
---
Same, or kill whatever might be munching a wall.
---
Please do. You will find it is not random. I obviously can’t tell as well if a bloodbug or tick is attacking the alpha during the thick of it, but we’ve lost some Yao Guai and others to the alpha when it spawns in the room with the animal and the code was used.
---
I am on the Xbox platform and mine has always worked.
---
I’ve had a similar experience with a friend of mine it pissed us off and confused use cause he had a normal hunting rifle, he was level 5 and he one shot me a level 56 with an armor rating of 172 and my friend whose level 26 in full power armor and just we died
---
I found this out after buying an Unstoppables 2 Mag off someone, all I need...and a Bumblebear.
---
Any furious auto gun, I have a FE gat plasma, with it I 2 maned the queen in 5 minutes. My friend was also using a fe handmade so we had 2 fe guns and 2 maned her in 5 minutes.
---
Right? Like it makes 0 sense.
---
Is it just me when I see it I’m just like whatever then keep playing.
---
Can confirm this is also happening with Instigating as of at least 5/25.
---
😃
---
Right
---
100%
---
I would say you're wrong on Habitat A being the i my worthwhile one. Habitat B (Toxic Valley) has toxic sludge spawn in both the piles as well as a high % chance on any molerats you kill. Considering how many molerats can spawn, this one can be incredibly easy to get to max level while solo.
---
I often find that i can get it up to level 3 solo while 2-3 people in habitat A are struggling and only finish on level 2.
---
How are they going to downvote you you’re right is a wasteland hahah
---
This guy gets it.
---
Overseers camp has a bridge really close to it. If you jump off the roof i to the shallows you’re able to go down for a revive. Someone else suggested it in another thread... I and another person were able to complete this away today.
---
well made point.  this has happened to me several times too :(
---
Downvoted for this what?
---
Yeah I killed a Scorchbeast that was destroying a low levels base once, then msgd the guy about it coz I couldn't fix his walls
---
As someone who is always the main damage source during queen fights (as I said FE gat plasma with beam splitter etc I stack so much damage that a single core and take out 1/3 of her health in like 30 seconds) my biggest tip if your not doing great against the queen help out us damage scourges such as the fe heavy gunners and bloodied melee’s by keeping the trash off of them, the bloodied melee’s in particular need to have the trash kept off them. Clear the trash cause if someone  using a Furious gun particular fe gun even has the explosion splash onto that trash they lose their Furious stacks and have to start from nothing again. Basically if u don’t have a Furious auto ranged gun  or Bloodied melee, clear the trash and hope you have a couple people with those guns to really do damage
---
I might be misinformed than, I've never actually made it past level 20.
---
Collector can be done. The magazine that is not in thengame is not needed for the badge.
---
The board would save on budget. The little letters can only do so much until you run out. Then you have to scrap stuff before you can continue.
---
It seemed to me that this is so over complicated due to the outcry of "It's too easy and boring. There are no mechanics. What sort of dungeon is this?" responses Beth got after they released the burrows. Like they went from one extreme to another. The devs don't understand middle ground I guess.
---
Really? I thought only Bloodied are affected. So there is pattern - instigating and bloodied share similiar logic - more damage under certain circumstances.
---
Everything is racist now a days.
---
Well my question is how I'm supposed to ever make caps up to a ridiculous 25k to even have a chance at my dream weapon, when I have to spend them all on overpriced crap to even have a selling chance.
---
This sounds great. Let the fast travel mat allow us to pick our own spawn/fast travel point, then have the camp module pick the visitor spawn point just outside the build area. Then we can choose which way they come in from, but they aren't spawned into traps immediately.
---

I used to carry a slandered auto.45 combat rifle and 10mm pistol they got more use then anything, I have upgraded to the fixer but still pretty slandered, my new 10mm is a quad explosive thats like 1 pound i'm not giving that up.

Damn that sounds like the same bug. Guess I've been lucky so far

Any chance of high resolution bot map?

Where is everyone finding all the AAE and swing speed at? I farm ALOT I mean 1-2 straight hours of straight whitespring ghoul slaughter, and I haven't gotten shit. I have about 150 hours logged and I would think it enough to have my build complete, but no.
---
Thanks....it worked!
---
No...
---
No idea, people are so sensitive they cant handle anything, even as minor as a sarcastic remark lmao
---
Well you would have to be first in that work to look for them there, your best bet is to save some caps and buy them off some players

Tje fact that you would even ask that tells me you haven't figured out how to play the game yet. Instead of insulting people, calling them names and insinuating they have no life and live at home try learning for a change. I have a 40+ hour a week job, I work out 4 days a week, and i try to maintain at least a decent social life, yet on top of that i have very little trouble getting 1,000 to 1,400 caps a day just from the vendor. Just use your head. I also have a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that you keep referring to this as your "dream " weapon but saying it isnt worth more than 500 caps. Stop calling people names and being a miserable sob just because someone has a different opinion on something than you do. Also reality check I bet if you ask the guy with you "dream weapon" he has already sold it and got the price he wanted for it.
---
I laughed far too hard when I pictured this from both perspectives.

Boooooo

I can't for the life of me wear down a crossbow to the point it needs repairing. Lol it's the only part I need to complete the challenge

“Can we copy strike him”
---
Yes.
---
Yes, don't listen to the hate
---
Or make growing it require a 5 fertilizer every time you harvest it.
---
What makes you say that?
---
I'd say wait a little longer. The game still has many bugs and there's still a pretty decent lack of content. However, they're fixing both of these issues really quickly and I say that maybe in a month or two, it will probably be worth it.
---
You'll get one shotted by high level players.
---
Solid advice, I’ll keep it in mind
---
Wont let me trade it or drop it :(
---
It’s a good game, just misunderstood
---
That isnt protected under freedom of speech. Not in the US at least.
---
Awww
---
yes it would
---
Take a wild guess.
---
Ugh im so sorry. They probably did that on purpose
---
Thats fine thanks for tips though :D
---
Gotta be on the base floor level.

Especially for us actual "fags" that play.

If they could implement a minigame akin to lockpicking while you pickpocket, I'd be down 100%.

Running a low health build; nerd rage, ironclad, if you have quite a few points in Agility, then also evasive. You definitely need to have serendipity. Maybe either mysterious saviour or armor with life saving incase you are downed.
---
If going melee, you should stick to low health with rads, and use radicool to boost strength. Blocker to lessen attacks from melee/animals and gunbashing from ranged humanoids
---
And you find you are still taking alot of dmg but have alot of perks in agility. You can take dodgy.
---
Uh, what? Ive only failed Campfire once, and that was because I wasn’t paying attention and let the fire die. The chance for badges is pretty low though. 10 or 25%, depending on who you ask.
---
Thanks
---
Almost everyone of those people has never played the game. Or is exaggerating the problems to get YouTube views. It's actually a really great game I have 270 hours playing it I would know.
---
I'd like a guest book in the terminal or a corkboard for notes. It seems sad that all I can do to praise quality builders is give them a thumbs up, assuming they are even around.
---
You’re welcome, I only noticed it yesterday. Glad I was able to help
---
Most likely anyway thanks for trying have a good day!
---
I have level 20 bloodied explosive western revolver and I am considering making a designated PvP troll. I also have a level 10 TSE Pipe Rifle, but I think the sweet spot will be somewhere in the middle.
---
Well I’m asking you guys, the community, if you think it’s worth sinking my teeth into. My guess right now is not yet, but soon. Maybe after e3.
---
[My promotion came through!](http://imgur.com/a/A7sHCpF)
---
I mean pickpocketing works off the assumption that the other player doesn't see you doing it, implementing it would be only available in surival and encourages swiveling issues. Then comes the conversation about how much this would ruin the incentive to earn gear when all you have to do is steal it or know that yours will be stolen. I mean there's no upside to this aside from discouraging afk players...you know like anyone that ever wants to open a menu or look at a map before OOPS stood still too long...
---
Then I trust you lol. In your experience, how have the bugs affected you?
---
I've had this hang recently with no mods at all. The only mod I've ever used is Better Inventory, but I quit it a few patches back once I had a decent feel for inventory management.
---
I think I was drinking something at the time, but I can't be sure.
---
Just did a silo run and the sentry bot in the mainframe room kept respawning lmao
---
Some say right now is the best time to buy, so that you can take advantage of the new updates limited time early bird bonus. Those who clear the games newest mode called "arktos assassin" before it comes out of beta are instantly boosted to max level (999) with maxed perk points and all perk cards. It is very hard though. Arktos assasin is FO76s answer to the BR craze, but with a new spin. You enter a lobby of 100 contestants, and when the timer ends it becomes a free for all, except it is played in real life. The game uses location data provided by your console to pinpoint the location of every player and then sends that information to every other contestant. You have to hunt each other down. You defeat another player by destroying their console, which is the only way for it to stop broadcasting location data. To stop people from just camping at their console for home advantage, you have to be carrying it with you and if your console pings you at the same location for more than 10 minutes you are disqualified.
---
The images in TF2 are 300px x 300px, the screenshots are sometimes over 4000px wide. So they would have to reduce their size server-side, which is doable, but its the F team they got on this project, not their best guys
---
172 is low armor rating even tho in this game you can ignore your DR as its mostly irrelevant in PvP. Defensive math happens on layers of effects such as fireproof + dense.
---
I saw someone have a deathclaw head on their wall. My assumption was it wasn't available yet.
---
Ive done it on 4 characters so far, no issues other than actually downing and not straight dying.
---
I mean, if you don’t tag the Alpha, you’re missing out on a potentially good legendary. Which you get even if you fail. Not a great incentive to actually follow the nice target around.
---
Funny, but not very helpful
---
Do you use the splitter muzzle? I think that's required for the full explosive exploit.
---
I think he’s referring to the one about grabbing.
---
That’s why it should just be a number of caps based on a players sneak peek level
---
Turn down the HUD opacity
---
as I see it you’re not going to make the perfect build as you have conflicting weapon styles.  I made 5 characters around 5 weapon styles:  melee, heavy, pistol, rifle, shotgun.
---
Shotgun and melee are very similar stat point wise, heavy could be as well (went 15 charisma for fun).
---
The thing is pistol and rifle, as I built them, aren’t compatible with each other, and aren’t compatible with the str builds.  Per/agi/hint of luck for rifle and hint of per/agi/luck for pistol.  The str builds tend to ignore perception in place of agility, and defer a bit from luck.
---
Too bad about the unloved stats of endurance and int (and charisma for most).  I’d love to see energy weapons move to int to give us more build options.
---
Chill just caps
---
Indeed
---
Not true, the constitution over rules any TOS as far as legalities go. The company can ban said person and prevent them from using any of the services provided by them. But to say that a company can ban a constitutional right also a basic human right at that is so not true. 
---
Also racial/discriminatory/offensive languages are highly subjective. A person may see having the American flag as being patriotic and a sign of good behavior but some person may see it as being racist.
---
TBH it's a Bethesda game and a Fallout game. This game followed suit with all previous Fallout games it was a very buggy game at release but now there are not that many. Overall the gameplay experience has improved greatly and keeps getting better.
---
Many of the haters seem to forget we had to save FO4 every 5 minutes or risk losing our progress to crashing.
---
I had better luck in the sector where the radstags spawn.  Got way more food an got the trough 2/3 full. More than I have managed before.
---
It blows me away how nice everyone is. I had accidentally looted someone's supply crate and had a 10 cap bounty and was super bummed that I couldn't see other people or their stores (I love shopping ok..) but I ran into this level 90 something and just took my armor off and sat down and he killed me. When I came back he gave me some stimpacks and some random clothes. 
---
Even when I'm wanted people are nice to me.
---
Their is a mod to carry +30 sos total of 60z
---
I was right near Watoga forever too, but with all the fast traveling players for vending, at one point my base was being assaulted by 3 deathclaws lol. Like it was time to find a new spot.
---
Theres a backmad mod that adds 120 carry weight total...
---
Wow. A bunch of the_donald posters, actual antisemites, racists and misogynists in this thread telling people to "grow thicker skin".
---
Disgusting.
---
Thanks. :D
---
Give us the automatron robot building system for it too. I want to make KLE0
---
My experience with ‘honest/unbiased’ criticism has come from Joseph Anderson who seems like he really wanted to like the game for what it can be and that he truly did enjoy his time but couldn’t get past the bugs. If those bugs are becoming less of a problem then I may just grab up the game when I’ve got the cash.
---
I assume Bandolier works on railway spikes? At least steel farming is a lot easier after the Scrapper buff.
---
Damn, I have a spot right above my camp and didn't even know it. Thanks dude!
---
That would be class man, what’s your name? mines lennon316smith
---
You have very little to lose I paid full price on release day and I do not regret my purchase
---
Yeah my bad, my character is female (made to look like my beautiful ex-partner) and I wear that Rocket suit and the Lady Grognak outfit.
---
If ya still got it I'll take it
---
Thanks for being genuine, I’m very new to Reddit so posting in a very active and vocal community is a little nerve-wracking.
---
Sigh.  Damn camp system is still buggy.  I never touch mine anymore because I'm worried about something getting stuck that I can't make un-stuck unless I move the whole damn camp.
---
Lol you'll get over it. I joined reddit because of FO76
---
Is it bigger on the inside?
---
And for the love GOD! People! Stop going to defend the strongest animal. I feel everyone is so lazy. It always ends up being everyone in the same room defending the strong animal that only needs like 1 high LVL player to protect him and then it's just me alone protecting a stupid radroach. And the ghoul is dead in like 2 seconds because no1 was there.
---
Serrated and stealth for the combat knife are both scrap mods. Medium chance, which I think is 20% per scrap.
---
Cool thanks... I'm gonna stay checking this
---
im selling one for 1k. nobody comes by my shop.... sadface
---
I think it's an energy weapon thing. My flamer breaks super fast as well.
---
I agree that this needs to be fixed and its a bit silly that it hasn't been fixed yet now that the game has been out for 6 months.
---
You dont have your own opinion on a game you've been following since launch?
---
Yeah, depending on the amount of stakes you're carrying, if its worth it.
---
Yeah, when fighting other mobs and collecting the railway stakes off them, ice found I actually gain ammo over time, but then it all dissapear if I use on the queen
---
I would appreciate this so much personally because you’re helping out everyone.
---
Not just caps, it's also my weapons and armor and aid. So yeah, fuck this suggestion
---
Maybe? i guess it's worth mentioning that my tactic is usually stabbing, backing up to avoid a melee attack, stabbing again.
---
I was a stealth sniper too when I first met the queen and for a while I tried a prime gauss rifle for a bit but it never seemed to do enough damage to the queen and the slow fire rate and long reload times made it useless against the myriad of high level scorched mobs that come in wave after wave after wave.
---
So my official advice is to invest into heavy weapons perks and find yourself a nice gatling or machine gun that does some actual damage if you really want to feel useful during scorched earth.
---
HOWEVER
---
A dirty little secret if you don't want to switch out perk cards before the fight is that a plasma rifle with a flamer mod does continuous meaningful damage in a wide berth in front of you (making it essentially an automatic) AND it gets its bonuses from the rifleman perk series. If you get lucky enough to get a Zealots plasma, then you've got a serious damage doer specifically for the queen fight.
---
The only drawback is that the flamer chews through ammo and those plasma cartridges are super expensive to craft and buy. But with player vending being a thing it's just a matter of hopping camps and servers until you find that one guy selling a few thousand plasma cartridges for a cap each.
---
They have explosive diarrhea
---
I have my own opinions, but I’m asking for a new perspective that I can’t have because I’ve never played it.
---
Thanks! Help spread the word!
---
Guess I need to get on that. ....for everyday use but I just hit the train station with 600lbs.. Can't we get a " cost to effect" chem or perk. I rarely find myself so dreadfully over wrought with weight it be nice to have the option to spend some caps for a bus ride or super strength perk
---
Your stash is only accessible to you. If you access any stash box on the entire map you will only see your stash. If someone accessed a stash box on your camp they will only see their stash.
---
I'm going to do nothing and watch you repeatedly die. I don't have to collect the bounty because I know somebody, somewhere is going to kill you. I win either way. Punjies don't kill people, stupidity kills people. I just watch and laugh. Then pick up your junk.
---
Lol
---
yes i have it
---
60 carry weight is the standard version lol
---
Maybe try to read the poster again. Dolly sods worked for me.
---
My best bargain purchases were from a lvl 5 mule account. I think it would be better if they added a way to see if there were legendary items at a vendor. I’m more frustrated traveling to see something and only finding regular gear and overpriced outfits
---
How bad was it? I would ignore it personally. I feel like racist people would exist in the world of fallout so if anything it's kinda immersive.
---
It depends on what it was though, I haven't actually seen the camp.
---
Nice. Simple and clean.
---
You are awesome!
---
No idea.  
---
Was not impressed with combat knife damage early on, so have not tried one lately.
---
You're asking a question that does not have an objective answer. And the subjective answer is a no brainer given the sub you're in. Save for a select few brainlets who get off on torturing themselves, nobody in this sub is gonna say this game isn't worth it because it is assumed we all enjoy it. Otherwise we wouldn't be here.
---
If you have the backpack you can go to an armor workbench and craft a level 50 standard backpack with 60 carry weight. I think it costs something like 27 cloth.
---
I normally only cripple one of their legs. Easier to see what's going on.
---
It’s much better.
---
I do that too. Players in hazmat suits appreciate it the most.
---
With shotguns being potato'd: if we didn't have Enforcer, shotgun builds would be in a very sorry state.
---
Well, the level 50 pack gives 60. The high capacity gives another 60. Deathclaw steaks give +2 str (+10 carry weight), the radstag or Brahmin give +20 carry weight, the rad ant lager gives +50, plus you can swap your damage perks out for weight reduction perks just to fast travel. I have reduced about 900lbs to about 400lbs and had my carry weight up to 480ish just to fast travel. There most certainly are sufficient capabilities to accommodate even the hoardiest of hoarders. I know. Because I'm one of them 😅😂
---
I can also confirm it spawned at the travel point just north of the spot at Charleston station. Someone had their camp at that pond so I went north and found it by the other end of the railroad bridge.
---
No way.. headed there now!
---
Pretty much all major bugs are fixed. A few small ones still linger. But nothing that will ruin your game play. Now is a good time to jump in. Most of the trolls have moved on.
---
Fair point
---
I picked it back up a couple weeks ago after deciding it might be worth it. If you’re starting out rn, yeah I think it’s fairly worth it. It’s not perfect and it’s not 100% still, but it’s a hell of a lot better than it was at launch
---
Yknow, thats my bad. Ive not taken a look through the challenges in game, and in the files it was listed as "all". Figured it was a challenge for all weapon plans. Not 76.
---
It's better than ever. Just don't feed the Yao Guai.
---
For one thing, I’m new to reddit, and for another it is entirely reasonable to ask people who are enthusiastic about this game to set aside their enthusiasm and be level-headed which most everyone in this comment section has tbh. If you enjoy the game, all I’m asking is for you to tell me why fam.
---
Can you use the perks that increase your armor (like ironclad) or is that not compatible with the berzerker legendary effect? That might help mitigate the downsides.
---
I still agree that berzerker needs a buff, especially when compared to bloodied. I'm just curious really.
---
Wander around killing shit for a while each day. It takes me maybe 20-30 minutes to pick up enough random guns and armor to sell to vendors.
---
Count me as part of this company that misery loves.
---
Water purifiers help a lot. 4 caps per water, and unless you want everyone else to take them you'll have to lock all or most of them, and they barely use any budget at all.
---
Another 1
---
Man I'm gonna tell ya, on my bloodied build, adrenaline perk really pushes my per shot dmg through the roof....not sure how the math works on that though...at 30% health i go from topping out at 251 dmg to 443....with only 3 points in the perk and it lasts for 30 secs...i use a primed bloodied 50 cal, all heavy perks, bloody mess, adrenal mutation....the perk motivates you kill trash
---
Worst place to nuke.
---
This happened to me and a friend of mine, it was a low level but obviously a twinked account or alt. We punched at them ( I know it does nothing but it's cathartic) and they were dumb enough to attack back. We killed them and then it went back and forth with us and their friends. They ended up going through the trouble to nuke my house. I just logged off and came back 15 mins later lol. They started messaging us trying to troll us. Oh well lol
---
Which train station is that
---
I thought when they announced the in game camera they said they would come out with pictures frames that you can frame your photos with?? Please tell me I wasn’t dreaming
---
Would be awesome but can't happen because they would need to licence every song every player wanted to have playing.
---
&gt; locked
---
When this happens, I repeatedly pick all doors in the base, especially if the owner is home, I give them a stern talking too about poor customer service. If they decide to murder me, I will keep coming back and doing it until they either remove the locks or move servers. (You can't be locking people in your house because of a spawn bug, especially when you've been told about it.)
---
Does that make me a bad person? Maybe.
---
I think the thing is that to fix all the bugs still there the game would stagnate because we as the player base want to continue playing. I assume the method being used is add a little, fix a little. It’s a similar method I use as a teacher, actually - add in new activities while refining and improving old ones so students don’t get bored of what you’re doing. The time it would take to fix everything without adding any new content would result in them having a perfect game with no players.
---
This question is asked daily on here. It's an eyesore.
---
I recommend it. I was a holdout and I finally picked up the game and just recently my wife started playing too. It’s a lot of fun to explore and I enjoy playing the game solo or in groups.
---
Oh, well I’m very sorry to be an annoyance. If it helps, I think I got my answer.
---
Nope... havnt done a thing... those 9.5 patches didnt add a thing... I'm being an ass before anyone gets into their feelings..
---
You know a lot of the whitespring is very capable of this. They have the Manny's and outfits worn, they can def cycle these. Then when you click on the boot it can take you to the atomic shop.
---
Thanks, I think I’ll pick it up soon
---
I play on xbox or I would... I stay using my pistols
---
Near whitespring station  was the proper flat ground i could find near a track
---
First spot i buildt on  was near a road but i couldn't make a platform for the tents
---
The only reason ( I can think of) it would be nice is if you had a "no gun" zone in your shop. It would be a pretty fun rp idea.
---
Awesome. There’s a massive wealth of info available on this subreddit once you get into the game.
---
&gt; Treasure
---
Any chance you'd consider treasure map locations? Looks like my post didn't show up last time. Thanks
---
The pip-boy numbers aren't trustworthy, but it's possible that explosive damage doesn't get split across multiple projectiles, so you'd actually get two 125% damage shots, or two 100% damage shots if the damage multiplier is broken as well. You'd need to test.
---
Bloodied doesn't give the correct numbers unless you have the weapon equipped.
---
I’ve had Reddit for about 3 years but have never used it until recently, I think I’ll be visiting this sub quite a bit in the near future!
---
I have to redo mine because people keep getting stuck in the floor 😩
---
There are perks to reduce weigh of Junk and chems by 90 percent. The cost to effect is that you lose overall damage from taking those perks instead of a damage boost perk,
---
Lol I love it
---
yea the spring board trap does that kinda
---
alright, I will take your word for it and try it out.
---
Been meaning to reply to this much earlier but in any case yes ---- that would be a really great idea, and something a bit different than what Bethesda has done in the FO cannon.
---
Thanking you\~!
---
Yeah
---
Looking for that damn sword, were you? My first three attempts were 
---
Sneak sneak sneak AAH!!! RUN RUN RUN DIE
---
Bug for me is learn recipes. I think you need to learn 17. I have learned far more than 17, and its stuck at 4 for me.
---
That's what I thought.. just got to find a way to keep them on it.. or make a well they would get shot into where the torture can begin.. Tesla and plasma traps... flamer and boards with rusty nails.. muhaha
---
Well put any junk and aid away you dint want to lose, besides that if you get killed lose some caps, I usually lose 12. But it's fun and you can get a lot of xp
---
No problem you too
---
I haven't checked my excavator or ultracite armours but I presumed it was for the x-01. Yes, it seems odd that it shows as craft-able.
---
How'd you build a tree house? I thought you always had to have walls or stairs going up to a platform.
---
Too bad for you.
---
Well that makes me feel a lot better...
---
I didn't check the numbers when I bought it on my main and immediately transferred it over to my level 25 and got quite a shock. I guess I won't know for another 20 levels but I hope it ends up being on top of the TS. Thanks
---
Thanks, good to know! I'll be visiting all the Travel-type locations in The Forest regularly until I can confirm them all.
---
Unlike some of the larcenous bastards around here, I actually felt bad the first time I thought I’d accidentally stolen something from someone else’s stash.
---
Did you really just make a post to tell us something we figured out the second it was patched in..... I hope you feel embarrassed
---
Except for the revive someone part. I’ve been participating in events but no one stays dying long enough to revive. Selfish bastards.
---
Not true you can so B.  Don't kill the rats just grab all the sludge and keep moving. When no sludge kill rats.  When the rats die there is more sludge. Should kill 10 at a time.
---
I agree I saw a deathclaw Do that sliding then tonight as well
---
It sure is. What really winds me up at times is placing wires, half the time I jump instead of the wire connecting. Sometimes it'll happen at the end too so I quit out of building then go back in. That this bug is still happening is irritating.
---
 I just figured out each section was. What is this term embarrassed? I have never heard of it.
---
About 500 nw of vault 51....youll see why
---
Yep saw a deathclaw doing the same thing yesterday
---
I thought they didnt drop from deathclaws.  You can only find them in containers is what I was told.  I have been helping a friend try to find one but no luck.  I just loot every thing.  I may be wrong though.
---
Bloodied shotguns are fine (bloodied everything is fine), although I'm not sure how well they work with VATS. I normally ADS to reduce the spread, because video game logic.
---
I'd recommend a combat shotgun with perforating magazine, true long barrel and stock. 2-3 points of Skeet Shooter to cut the spread. Speed Demon to close the range. Usual bloodied defensive perks: Serendipity, Dodgy if you have spare AP, Lone Wanderer if solo, Blocker if you're inclined to get punched. Emergency Protocols for PA.
---
If you build on the edge of a cliff. You can make to seperate levels from different foundations that line up 1 just underneath the other. Set up a spring trip underneath and infront of a vending machine. Then when people come to buy, either have a switch to engage it, or a pressure pad. BOOM! launched off a cliff
---
It's more where you go.  You head to Whitesprings or anywhere in the Mire you'll have high levels showing up.  Stick to the forest and you're safe.  Level up via events, sleep regularly (+5% exp for 2 hours), and hit the WV lumber yard way up in the left upper corner and Grafton Steel (5 - 25 lvl).  None of them will spawn as lvl 63 Super Mutants. WV is way easier and has tons of diffferent resources and scrap available.  Grafton is mostly scrap and a billion super mutants which is a great enemy to hunt for exp.
---
Bloodied maxes at 60%. Instigating is double. It still run it like a bloody with adrenal and nerd rage. Its 40% more damage with that first shot, which ussually is the only shot. Bloodied is still better on others guns of course. But high damage ones like dragon, railway, gauss on a sniper build benefit better from instigating.
---
Me. I would have thought it.
---
Automatic is where its at.
---
There’s a YouTube tutorial on how to do it
---
I'll be on that soon.
---
Because it only counts if you're the lucky bastard who gets the final bullet in her.
---
Bloodied maxes at 60%. Instigating is double. I still use adrenal and nerd rage. Its just that with a sniper build its a better effect by far. Of course it useless against mob bosses. There bloody still reigns so i do use it there.
---
That person is a  [https://i.imgur.com/a3uWNvt.png](https://i.imgur.com/a3uWNvt.png).
---
What platform are you on?
---
I’d love it if we could leave notes on people’s terminals. I have a suspicion that I have one of the camps that screws over those who fast travel in, and I’d like to know for sure.
---
Those idiots are a big bag of  [https://i.imgur.com/a3uWNvt.png](https://i.imgur.com/a3uWNvt.png).
---
PS4 but I found one 10 minutes ago thanks for the offer though
---
See. My camp is located in such an area where I don’t have to have those things. If you’re high level my camp is a complete nuisance  gonna have Chinese robots attacking you. Mutated dogs. Ghouls. Mole rats. Fucking Bees. If you can make it through the bullshit I’ll always trade.
---
That's good to know. Besides the no NPCs bit, does it play like a regular Fallout fps?
---
I guess I'll boot it up. Thanks! =)
---
Any chance you could see it in your heart to do this for treasure map dig spots?
---
Yeah I found that out after running around looking for bones. I’m going to try the battered fedora tonight. Check here for locations: http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Battered_fedora_(Fallout_76)
---
If it's just caps, and it initiates pvp then I think it'd be interesting. The moment you start a pickpocket attempt you become vulnerable to the player, but you cant attack them until they attack you. Youre locked into the animation for a few seconds, then You can choose to continue the pickpocket attempt and risk getting killed while performing the task or you can cancel the attempt to fight back, though that doesn't cancel your vulnerability. If the player never attacks you then you cant hurt them.
---
Sweet Jesus, thank you. And also, wtf BETHESDA?!
---
Thanks I actively looked for anything given the broadcast but found nothing.
---
And that also raises questions about the 'Classical radio station to. Was it like a NPR or something that just went offline and auto loops the songs. I mean I'f it was hooked up to a fusion generator as back up it could essentially be broadcasting forever.
---
There are lots of NPCs....just not human lol. Little different, but still fallout. Melee is where it’s at.
---
"It just works"
---
I hit 1400 caps every day that I play. Here's what I sell:
---
- mentats: grab brain fungus and carrot flowers at Whitespring, firecaps at Slocum's Joe, and make mentats with chemist and super duper perks. For bonus caps, make orange mentats and grape mentats. Not only do they sell for more, but your quantity gets doubled again with chemist. You can grow/craft grape ingredients, and carrots for orange; get silt beans in Flatwoods.
---
- radaway: glowing fungus, water, and antiseptic. I usually get fungus in Flatwoods, which also has silt beans for orange mentats and bloodleaf for healing salve. Water from your purifiers, antiseptic from picking up abraxo everywhere.
---
- healing salve: bloodleaf, soot flower, boiled water. Get all three in Flatwoods along with other stuff above. 
---
- glowing meat steaks: I grab all the glowing meat I come across and cook it. It has value as high as drugs.
---
- clothes: specifically, golf outfits/skirts, straight jackets, and ski outfits. 
---
Alternatively, if you can craft mutation serums, they sell for 400-something caps each to vendors.
---
Haha I'll have to check it out... and no vendor... I dont include myself in a cash market... wanna barter some gordes I got you.. but you got to get into my farm
---
It is melee has the same issue with weapon dmg changing once it's equipped etc etc
---
Some sort of sneaky sniper with a pipe weapon.
---
With your current build you will die a lot and it will be a frustrating experience IMHO. It appears that you are trying to make a bloodied 2h melee character, something I have a lot of experience with. Based on my experience I changed your build to be much more point efficient and most importantly have significantly higher defense and slightly higher health, both of which will help you stay alive as a bloodied melee. The only thing I disagree with in the build I made for you is that I recommend not using nerd rage and then keep your health right around 30% (29% is optimal iirc). The extra damage from nerd rage simply isn't worth the trouble in my experience. For example, with my character I'm hitting for between 1200-1300+ per hit (before drugs) with my recommendations for perks and gear that will be below (with a 40% swing speed, +1 str, bloodied pole hook). This is enough to 1-3 shot everything except 3 enemies (bosses) in the game. Keep in mind this is not my character build below, I simply altered yours where I felt necessary.
---
**Mutations:**
---
I recommend that you remove electrically charged and highly recommend that you add adrenal reaction.
---
**Perks:**
---
Here is how I recommend fixing your build if you want to keep nerd rage:
---
[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f38487b&amp;d=s41ss2sm1se2sn1pe2c72i44ir2a72la2l71lu2eu0lt2sg2eh2ee2a00a40&amp;w=&amp;n=Melee&amp;m=68cfh](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f38487b&amp;d=s41ss2sm1se2sn1pe2c72i44ir2a72la2l71lu2eu0lt2sg2eh2ee2a00a40&amp;w=&amp;n=Melee&amp;m=68cfh).
---
Here is how I would change your build if choose to drop nerd rage:
---

---
We will discuss the missing points in agility later. I will try to explain each choice I made step by step (I will not discuss all of the possible swap in cards in-depth. Feel free to ask about any.).
---
* **Str**/Blocker - I always recommend having blocker in every build. It's simply too valuable to not have it. As a bloodied melee you now have two more reasons to take it because you will be hit by more melee attacks than most (for example any ranged build) and on top of that you don't have much health to work with. You will die to any semi-strong melee attack (Yao Gui, Assaultron, Deathclaw, etc.) without it.
---
* **Per**/Glow Sights - You only need 3 points in perception for glow sights and to swap in the locksmith cards.
---
* **Per**/Exterminator - Next to useless for you because you will be hitting so hard that armor won't matter for most enemies. Not to mention it already has extremely low value as a perk card on it's own (only targeting one class of creatures, unlike incisor).
---
* **End**/Rejuvenated - Complete waste because with speed demon (and even without it) you won't be well-fed or well-hydrated for long. Keeping this buff up is beyond annoying and not worth it. The bonuses are negligible even if it had 100% up time.
---
* **End**/Dromedary - Extremely low value. Food and water are cheap and abundant.
---
* **End**/Fireproof - Rank 3 - Another card I highly recommend for EVERY build. It's simply too valuable to not have it. And s -
---
* **End**/Lifegiver - Something I see overlooked a lot on bloodied builds. As a bloodied build your health is already low and the only way to increase it is to add to your base health. Contrary to popular belief, you can be a cannon without the glass in Fallout 76.
---
* **Chr**/Lone wanderer - This is fine while solo. Just make sure you have some cards to swap in if you join a party. If you have questions about good cards for that simply ask. One example is field surgeon (yes, even for a bloodied build). Another good card for your build is suppressor.
---
* **Int**/Makeshift Warrior - Makeshift warrior is fine but an argument could be made that you don't need that either.
---
* **Int**/Nerd Rage - As I said earlier keep nerd rage if you want it - I recommend moving those points to agility for more ap for power attacks and sprinting (things you do a lot as melee).
---
* **Agi**/Sneak - Sneak is not worth it for you depending on armor mod choices (with all ultra-light you don't need sneak at all to effectively remain undetected). Besides, you don't care if things see you. Sprint over to them and one shot them with the business end of your 2h.
---
* **Agi**/Ninja - Along the same lines as sneak, ninja is not worth it. You already one hit most all things and the things you don't one sneak attack won't make a difference.
---
* **Agi**/Action boy/girl - A very good choice and another staple to nearly any build.
---
The remaining points in agility can be spent on a variety of cards that are better than some of your choices. I will discuss a few in addition to what I mentioned previously but ultimately the choice is yours (if you don't want to run all ultra-light armor for example, choose sneak rank 1 or 2).
---
* Adrenaline rank 1 (severe diminishing returns after rank 1)
---
* Marathoner (at least rank 1 - high value for a melee who will be, or should be, sprinting a lot)
---
* Escape artist (currently bugged, again, and also not really worth it now that you don't have to be out of combat to teleport away, not recommended)
---
* White Knight (very high value, without it you will need to repair at least one piece of armor after a SINGLE nuke silo run which is beyond annoying and could potentially consume a lot of resources)
---
* Dodgy rank 1 (I recommended you use this outside of nuke zones. You can use it inside nuke zones but only if you have a faster swing speed weapon because you will be constantly out of ap and delegated to light attacking until they fix that "bug" \[radiation apparently counts as taking damage and you will constantly be out of ap\])
---
* Born survivor rank 1 (this one is tricky to use for beginners and you can only use it if you don't use nerd rage since rank 1 is 20% health, not recommended unless you know what you are doing and you have ALL really good 3 star legendary gear and you follow my other recommendations below)
---
* Evasive (not a high value card unless you have 15 agility - but more defense is ALWAYS good for a bloodied build).
---
**Luck -** You made some very good choices in luck but you did make one very important mistake. ALWAYS use rank 3 Bloody mess. Bloody mess, unlike weapon damage perk cards (and many others) is a multiplicative increase to your damage (instead of being just additive). The game doesn't tell you this so it's an easy mistake to make.
---
**Gear**
---
After A LOT of testing I recommend using 3 pieces of armor with bolstering and 2 pieces of gear with unyielding (4 bolstering, 1 unyielding works well too). Full unyielding is unnecessary. I don't have enough space left in this post to go into detail (max is 10k characters).
---
**Misc.**
---
* Only use/craft stimpak:diluted. Healing yourself is now cheap and abundant.
---
* If you don't use field surgeon keep a close eye on your radiation while fighting the SBQ. In other nukezones don't bother running full bloodied it isn't worth the risk (you will still 1-3 shot most things even at 40%)
---
* Don't underestimate the armor mod "leaded" (radiation resistance). It's very useful for this build if you farm the SBQ a lot like I did.
---
I can't think of anything else off the top of my head. If I do, I will post them either in an edit to this post or a comment below this post. If you have any questions or need any clarification by all means, ask. Have fun!
---
That's....what I said? The company has full power to decide what is and isn't acceptable on their platform, even if it violates the constitution, because you are agreeing to their rules by using their service/system/building/etc.
---
Do you use unyielding armor?
---
People regularly post on here looking for someone to revive for Order of the Tadpole. Just put out your console and that you’re looking. I do all of mine in pools at Wavy Willard’s because it doubles for the swimming challenge.
---
I think there's a general bug here. I've had the same problem with both Magnetic Personality and Unyielding armor. It seems like I need to overshoot the charisma sharing requirement by a couple of points before it works. Otherwise as soon as I move, the card unshares.
---
Hooray!
---
TS grenade rifle also do double damage. Seems like they count as explosives and not bullets. Wonder if it also applies to missile and fatman. If so, for the love of god, DONT LET BETHESDA KNOW! As a matter of fact...delete this post. Shhhh....

Am I the only one with a dad that yelled at anyone leaving the door open that he’s not paying to heat the whole damn neighborhood? I can’t even walk by a simulated door without closing it.

VENDOR TORTURE PITT
---
This is key information. I didn’t know you both had to be in the water.
---
Never heard of her
---
The issue with it is, there's a higher risk due to open pvp and losing your aid items on death. And since so many f76 players don't like to pvp, and there is an adventure mode without pvp, your experience in survival mode will be HEAVILY skewed towards the assassin's sentinel's TSE spammers or getting one shoot by a bloodied explosive handmade
---
Props to you, my dude. Edge of the map. 😂
---
Well that’s just good business sense.
---
Before this video he just popped up out of nowhere and killed me I have proof
---
Forgot enforcer. Great for keeping melee enemies at bay
---
lol think i'll pass on a griefers wall of text.
---
It's nice because all of your unique quest rewards will be max level. Even if you don't want them, you can fetch a pretty penny selling max level unique rewards, especially the ones like the incendiary 10mm (perfect storm) with effects you can't get out in the wild yet
---
I grinned until level 20. Then I was able to use my black powder rifle, and two black powder pistols. I threw in a plasma grenade (missed) then shot it with my rifle, then the pistols and it was dead.
---
Demo Expert 5 plus a Fatman. Even if the nuke doesn't kill them it will make it hard to see for a couple seconds

I believe you can only get it from the Responder Vendor RE so it's reasonably very rare
---
+60 for lvl 50 bag scro and +60 with high capacity mod ☺️
---
U can see storms from a distance so maybe find some place high and look for storms.
---
nope. i use mostly mutants and vanguards.
---
What's weird is Fasnacht was so fun, even though it required a bunch of steps. But Arkos is like, way more difficult. And unless you have enough people, and they know what they're doing, you're gonna fail. 
---
It's not fun.
---
same .  except it unshares when im still standing there and looking right at it.     even out of combat and just sitting in camp.   nothing changes but the card unshares.
---
I casually walk around half bloodied w 540 carry weight in unyielding weapon weight armor and if I did strong back And any carry weight food I’d be at over 600 carry weight. Use the high capacity mod for backpacks and you get plus 120 carry weight and use some perk cards to get down your weight if it’s a problem, or carry less stuff😂
---
You rock. Joining
---
This! This right here is what also makes me sad. That was actually fun and brought people together. Good vibes off them. The others just feel like I’m batting with two outs and two strikes in the bottom of the 9th in a playoff ball game. One strike, and I lose everything.
---
Even then it doesn't count. I've accidentally melted her into an ash pile while taking care of the adds with an automatic tesla rifle, and I don't have the challenge done. At a different time I also melted her into a goo pile with my explosive gatling plasma (didn't think it would melt because you know, explosive) too. Those are two times where I am 100% positive I got the killing shot on her. Challenge still isn't done for me.

On da way... Dookiestorm
---
Yeah, but without a tape measure I can’t eyeball it well enough to remember if I originally put the camp on top of a rock that’s still clear or underneath where some floorboards are now. I had the thingy in both spots, but hell if I can remember where it ended up.
---
At the nuked clubhouse its often a free for all so I tag first, then cripple, and then get out of the way.  If there's a bunch of people ahead of me, I just toss some molotov's.
---
There have been times with 4-5-6 that no one else is around. I cripple and then take out the All Rise to finish the job (plastic is hard to come by). 
---
Don't think anyone gets pissed off at me.  I've teamed with others running down the WS road where they recognize what I'm doing and we get into a rhythm, allowing each other to share in the kills.
---
Thank you Ann Onymous

And the mods are still sleeping.

Wack

Nah, there is a cool little camp in psuedo cave.  Its where i have my camp.  I meant 500 ft NW

Where did..where did he fit that?
---
 No bc if I’m AFK and by some miracle a lv 5 finds me and pick pockets me he’ll walk away w 20-25k on most days
---
There's absolutely no reason why we shouldn't have a way of fast traveling while overencumbered, even if it's limited to train stations and/or costs more. At least now you have nukashine, which is slow and time consuming and requires a rare item but at least it's better than nothing
---
Ha, it works great for those of us that suck at pvp.
---

That gold in those hills originally came from the days in which Kansas, or as people know us as Flatland U.S.A, was a territory which extended to the Rockies. There was a gold rush, outlaws, and Kansas didn’t want the Rockies.
---
Yassss
---
Pretty much. I've only done Encryptid once and will probably never touch it again. Did Arktos a few times and aside from the amount of legendaries didn't find any point in doing it anymore. Got old fast. Disappointing cuz I adore this game but these past couple events have been disappointing to me. But that's just me and my semi-casual perspective on it.
---
Ty so much! That did it
---
Not kinda. People built camps on a cliff face and launched people into the air and off the cliff. Pretty funny videos.
---
Aww damnit! Guess I won't be buying it afterall
---
Yup and if you say anything about it they all come in jerking each other off and downvote you like some bitches lmao
---
Yeah, it feels more like Bethesda is trying to artificially make the events difficult and that can turn people off real quick. Its fun at first... then it gets old. Unlike the fasunaut parade event, these events get little activity when they go live.
---
sounds like pain, I love it.
---
Lewisburg - if it spawns mutants, kill em all, take their weapons, hobble to the train stations and sell em  
---
Penitentiary to Grafton...kill everyone, take all th weapons and sell them. 
---
Straight jackets, gold outfits and chems you dont use.  Sell em all!
---
....how many atoms did it cost?
---
I think Arktos is a tremendous amount of fun.  I enjoy the chaos and difficult enemies and at times can be challenging.  I have completed the event more times than I’ve failed, and don’t mind a few failures to get it right.
---
The problem as I see it is participation.  Several times I’ve started the event only to have the timer run all the way down and not one player joining.  I run around and do not stealth so others can see there is a high level player and the event has started, but still nothing.  I even started Arktos following a SBQ kill that had at least 12 players, and no one showed.
---
Even with a server wide announcement would not garner more participation, in my opinion.  A que or lfg system may help, but I believe they already have plans in place for server type selection.  Which could possibly mean, down the road, that those of us who want to participate could joined an “Events” server.
---
I have also not encounter any bugs or crashes on Xbox in Arktos.
---
I can’t find it, man. I must be blind. Is there anything near it?
---
Probably, but it doesn't happen very often, and it restarts quick. If I were quick at hitting alt f4 or any series of buttons quick, I'd probably pvp. I like the quests, exploring and building. Zero interest in PVP. I like the game more since they split the adventure &amp; survival.
---
Nope only can sell to players
---
Same as the clean space helmet. Semi rare at the best.
---
Cant afford the atom shop vending machines? Its free those are skins
---
Also vending machines are already in your build inventory in build mode its free
---
broken.
---
Not really, youll know when you see it.  There is a couple tents, a park table and a little wooden shack
---
Let me know when you find it
---
And that would definitely relieve that issue of less participation. But for me, it’s “was it worth it?” kinda mentality. Yes, Arkos is indeed fun, I’ve had fun. but will it down the road? That’s my concern, along with the other reasons I listed.
---
You clearly haven't encountered the bug where a player becomes one of the items needed to find the missing camper then ..... or the frustration of all the kindling spawning "wet" or had the event end without any reward in spite of successful finish ..... like literally everybody else .... Lucky You.
---
Mods won't get me banned?
---
Because the Scorch Beast Queen always lives to see another day.
---
Found it! Thanks man.
---
The riverfront Mothman shrine in Point Pleasant has a full skeleton with all lootable parts (albeit in a terrifying position)
---
I'll try to see if it's possible tomorrow!
---
i will check
---
Its an awesome place to build, use concrete floor on top of cave to make cool ceiling...or whatever you want.  My favorite spot.  Just sucks traveling due to caps
---
Agreed. Hopefully once they add that single player server we might be able to.
---
Thanks, been scratching my head after getting back from Watoga, and it didn't check off any instruments. (I played all the instruments at the highschool theater.)
---
It looks like a pretty good spot! I feel ya on the caps part though, it does suck.
---
I do make a stashbox and bench so i can scrap and store. But I forget to dump most of the time, and suck at finding buttons quick. I can hit a power button quick. I don't mind losing the junk, I just hate someone else being rewarded from a sneak attack.
---
Dont forget the fire barrels!
---
Fyi, in case you didn't know you don't have to fight the imposter sheepsquatch at all for the Lyin' Lowe questline. Its just a bonus.
---
Awesome, well have fun man
---
Hmm not sure, it does this to me also but I figured it was unyielding doing it.
---
Very broken. Several of the requirements to complete it will never register.
---
\*\*\*FREE SPEECH AS IT PERTAINS TO THE CONSTITUTION ONLY GOVERNS THE GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO CENSOR YOUR SPEECH, IT LITERALLY DOES NOT MATTER IN ANY LEGAL SENSE IN ANY OTHER WAY JESUS FUCK\*\*\*

I recommend using the medium preset in-game and don't change the other graphics settings except fullscreen (aside from GPU memory usage the in-game settings make very little difference in performance - this was tested long ago and posted here on reddit and you can reproduce the tests yourself). To use more of your GPU you can try turning vsync off by using \[Display\] iPresentInterval=0 in your custom INI. If you haven't tried disabling the grass via the INI it is not the same as the in-game slider. The game doesn't run good even on very good hardware so don't feel bad. At some point you just have to find what is acceptable to you. It's not about luck. It's a background program, a mis-configuration, or the game just doesn't like your hardware combination.
---
The high capacity backpack is +160, but excavator is +200 with shocks. +300 with the bug.
---
I have been curious about this. I came across one that was a responder eye bot that required you to be wearing the responder uniform, so i think there's more to it. 
---
But kudos on the translation!
---
yeah i tried all over.  my camp, one violent night, etc.   
---
some people are getting credit for playing at locations afaik.
---
Thanks for the tips.
---
idk
---
swimming badge is test + swim test + revive player in water + 3 pics at wavy willards
---
athletics is even easier- actually aan and passed all the races overencumbered
---
and that last word is it- if you don't need 60 extra carry weight- don't go out of your way but definitely worth it if you do
---
Go up to kiddie corner cabins in the toxic valley. There's a daily there for toxic cleanup, gives pemmican.
---
just as an experiment i moved 2 points into charisma to make my CHR 9 ,    which is the "ammount needed" to share a rank 3 card.  
---
now on paper i already had 10 chr because im using herd mentality but apparently the game is having a bug where  the only levels that count towards the card share are allocated ones. not mutated ones (or from gear)
---
either way it is some kind of a bug because now the card sharing isn't turning off.
---
Just waiting for things to slow down and the rush is over and bugs sorted then I’ll give argos a try
---
Had  a Sheepsquatch disappear today during Free Range.. no one got to loot it.
---
There are some people after I read / listened to their stories that I did want to bury out of respect.
---
I just hope it's not like my Overseer quest that won't complete
---
Events give tons of xp. 300+ just for completing it. Hop around and complete them. Sleep for rested bonus xp, eat some cranberry cobbler and hide as best you can in survival for that extra +20%. Be on a team for extra 15% charisma perk.
---
I know but I want to know if there is a recipe to make it
---
Yes
---
Vats
---
Maybe grenades
---
If you look around the forums you meet her a cheap legendary Fatman. That's what I did but I scrapped it. Tse Fatman was like 1k and is a lot of fun to say the least
---
New to fallout. Trying to learn. Thanks. Juggling act with all the perks and food. My head is about to explode
---
Really want to come across one of these camps. I wear two pieces of -50% falling damage armor at all times so they're in for a surprise when they see me survive the fall unharmed.
---
thanks
---
You're always going to get a biased answer: either Yes if its r/fo76 or a no if its r/fallout
---
😂😂sorry
---
its not letting me target it in vats sad days
---
So you dose yourself with nulashine to fast travel.  That's to funny. But I like it
---
tried that too nothing
---
Does take awhile scrapping then to learn plans but persistence and I think I know all mods to it
---
My chr gets close to 20 with full rads, but turns off cards when I die or fast travel, I think the game thinks I have full health during those times and lowers it back down
---
I just hate how all enemies run away from you, when you're on a roof they can't get to then somehow the second you're back on the ground, they know you're there.  Especially ghouls... they run away like Usain Bolt. Ghouls should NOT be that "smart" to run away or even run that fast..
---
i even looked around the area to see where he might have fallen in with the hopes of falling in also
---
lolz, “They’re working out some bugs.”
---
Where was the location of that one? I will have some more time tomorrow, I might go by there and update if that bot says anything different. I’m hoping someone can pull a actual location from these bots. If there actually is one. That’d be cool
---
Yeah I'm familiar w that process.  Scrapped literally 1600 Marine pieces to learn buttress chest.  Idk if anyone but me realizes how much rubber asbestos and plastic that is 😂 i haven't even used a marine chest since Then either 😂
---
Going to sheep in 5min on same server
---
Get a furious, or bloodied. They are actually quite strong atm.
---
Good post imo. The big group events stink when you get turds hanging out leeching for sure. but when you get that one group that jives and everyone fire their part it never it all worth while Imo. It's rare but that is sort of the challenge within a challenge
---
I have max Strength points but primarily use leather armor for its perks.  It does weigh a lot though
---
If you mod a legendary, is there a chance to lose the legendary perks?
---
I've had this happen just wait and they should respawn some distance away it'll take awhile but it'll happen just do something else in the mean time
---
I agree with all your point except for the title. The need to change the new event with a server notification. Taking other players junk bag stealing, giving the owner the choice to take revenge. And always 3* drop from the the 3 big event bosses.
---
Survival mode 20% + well rested 5% + wise mothman event 5% + canned meat stew 5% + leader bobble head 5% + granberry relish 10%
---
I'm sorry for the obvious question, I guess I just needed clarification on your very terrible take on the application of free speech.
---
I agree with you on the principle that people can for the most part say what they want, however, there are consequences for saying certain things.  If you are willing to accept said consequences, then have at it, say anything.  Its when people try to avoid the consequences of their words when trouble starts.
---
I'm not trying to buy one from somebody I'm asking about where in game you can find buy or learn it. So I can complete the challenge.
---
I found a stalking mothman, lvl 35. took a pic of him with my asylum outfit and hat, didn't work. And yes, I made sure that I got the tag first. His name showed up on my camera and took the picture but nothing.
---
Do you know any online game where this is possible?
---
ahhhhh that makes soo much more sense...
---
It’s always going to get better but you have to jump in at some point. 
---
I hated on the game without playing and finally caved when I found it really cheap a week ago. I haven’t stopped playing since. It basically feels like a survival version of Fallout 4 in a much bigger world. I personally love base building in games, so most of my time is spent looking for scrap in semi-dangerous places and visiting other players camps to buy building plans.
---
Occasionally I will do a couple of main quests to get some XP and caps then go back to playing it as a crafting/survival game.
---
Player base seems generally friendly. I’ve had no issues with griefing and been I’ve given several gifts by high level strangers visiting my camp.
---
part of why they are so weak is because anti armor on energy weapons does not work.
---
They work great if you put the shotgun in the enemies lol. Vats seems to be the only way to get decent damage with them anymore.
---
Well the title is more of me expressing how frustrating these new events feel. I’ve ran into all these points non stop after many, many of these events. It’s okay if you disagree with my title, I know, it sounds negative, but everyone feels different about how I feel which is okeydookie, not everyone’s gonna have the same experience.
---
Did he also just say he scrapped a legendary? Lmao this guy is drunk
---
This x3000 - those jars are pretty horrid
---
I looted mine in the room with the vendor at Pleasant Valley
---
Thanks! I appreciate this. You seem like you mostly play solo, is that right?
---
It's also because of her armor rate mushing up energy weapons. I was to say it's bugged in some sort but she laughs at by be lasers
---
I've had the same thing only got inside once.
---
I do it all the time. Most people like it. Often seems to help persuade some of the dbags that mow everything in front of them down to let other people tag them.
---
ok this is weird  
---
I was literally at the spawn location last night- it is a "cafe" between Welch Station and Blair Mountain on the sheet steel path between them-  and it is a particular named cat, Murgle  
---
I am thinking a player who I ran into aat Welch must have come from that way and killed Murgle so I didn't get to see them since the vid I found said Murgle respawned about every 20 minutes
---
okay will do thanks :D
---
Buried with honor.  Daily quest.  There you go.  Next complaint please.
---
Rather common, I used to sell those for 1 cap each yet no one still bought those
---
Never said they started with it, which is why it's not new and pretty obvious.  
---
Just because they didn't think of it before releasing the game doesn't mean it's a good excuse. If anything we know the game was rushed, we can all tell. So if only they were able to take their time, I'm pretty sure things like this would've been thought of before release.  
---
The Fallout community is one of the most patient. Rushing one of the games is the last thing they'd want for them and themselves as we can see from the after effects of this release.
---
woooo it worked thanks a tone .  idk if it was waiting or leaving the area but it fixed itself
---
No, not like leather armor / combat et.  it follows the raider path,'you can get leg mods that will help with sneaking
---
My boy is a good frog he deserves the best.
---
Great work dook. Killed her with 6:41 left. New record.
---
Fans: I want a harder event!
---
Bethesda: 
---
&gt;makes harder event
---
Fans:  what the fuck!
---
Same.  Just wondering.
---
Once you "Loot Check" a mob, it then sets your loot to public, EVEN IF the monster isn't dead yet.  That is a "bug"
---
Loot Check is automatic.  
---
Even if they fix that, it would not fix it if the mob's body (or body chunks from Bloody Mess) bounces past you faster than you can hit R and then some scavenger scoops up your loot.
---
I set mine up with power doors with keypads, one for entry and one for exit. Codes are posted right above the keypad and the doors close automatically after a few seconds. Keeps non-humans out and solves the door closing issue.
---
Same as here. Send me and invite and hint me down, I’ll make you a handmade and carry it with me till you find me. Then I’ll vanish into the night ;)
---
They need to somehow fix or change that system then bro. That suuuucks so much
---
This same issue is occurring on all Platforms (Xbox, PS, etc.) so regardless of how likely it could be due to a mod you have installed, the fact it's happening to players who can't install mods indicates there is an issue on Bethsda's side as well.
---
Wait you can take stuff??
---
That's odd, because for me the damn molerats don't ever drop sludge. \*Sigh\* another broken part of this event I guess...
---
what new items and plans? all i ever get is stimpaks, water, and some ammo and non-legendary weapons/armor I’m not gonna use🎷.
---
Thats what I experienced and my health went down fast almost 1.71 hp per second after my rad x went away my healing factor helped me but mine did not go away for the whole game.
---
This happens?
---
I spend over 40h total and saw only 2 rains, one lasted around 5min and other 20 but i took 30 pictures which none of those counted towards weekly challenge. On adventure it seems almost always raining, especially in the mire and northern region of the map
---
Oddly enough it doesn't matter that much once you go bloodied, because you can kill everything long before it reaches you. Still a good use of three points, but not the life-changing perk it is when you're not bloodied.
---
https://fo76map.com/
---
you can just filter the maps here
---
I just found the mod being sold by one of the robot vendors. I think it was either Charleston or Watoga but I’m not sure.
---
Ah I see the Zen of it!
---
Give 76 players perfectly preserved pies while wearing a fasnacht beret and laundered blue dress between 12:00pm and 12:30pm.
---
Often actually, not everyone runs marsupial or PA jet packs.
---
Glad to hear it!
---
Maybe someday the dice will roll our way and it will complete the challenge, just gives me another reason to go kill her again! Stay strong and keep putting the Queen down!
---
All plasma rifle barrels are affected by the rifleman perk. I'm not sure about pistol grips, but my flamer barrel rifle still gets a bonus from rifleman. Also idk what you're talking about, I have a vampire's flamer and it was a monster even before all the buffs. Now it's something crazy like 130 per hit on a continuous fire weapon with no damage boosting legendary effects
---
&gt; it's such a kitchen sink of activities all thrown at you so quickly, and it's very easy to fail it simply by being overwhelmed.
---
This is a better description of how I feel about the event than I can say myself.
---
Are you sure it's p and not the q that i heard of?
---
Fallout 76 has a serious data transfer problem from server to end users.  They seem to be doing little to no transfer error checking to end user.  This happens to virtually everyone on all systems it seems, at least once in a while.  The problem is "usually" fixed by either reloading world or exit game enter game.  If that doesn't work, complete uninstall, reboot, reinstall; and HOPE the inter-tubes are clear from system to you during install.
---
Dude I'm trying to run it right now
---
I'm calling bullshit
---
Fyi, if you have the aviator paint or the vault-tec paint set, you can just apply that and it will count as modding the fat man. Much easier than making the mod. Otherwise, if you didn't finish the free states bunkers quest in the mire yet, you can do that to get the daisycutter fat man. I believe it's guaranteed to have the MIRV mod on it when you get it - then you can just put on a standard barrel instead
---
Never use the code, you will lose an animal because of it unless you get very lucky as they will attack the alpha and get 1-3 shot very quickly. 
---
B is the easiest room, the mole rats spawn insane amounts and they also burrow and pop up right next to you so you can loot them quickly. They do the legwork for you, plus the oozing pools are lootable. I can get to 45-60 solo every time.
---
B also has the easiest alpha, cripple him and hes a joke, or don't cripple him and hes a joke, either way. He is extremely slow, and doesn't run away when you get out of range of his melee.
---
This event can be solod with a good ranged weapon and I have done it a few times, though most of the time people join midway and I rarely actually ever solo it.
---
It's almost like more than 100 people play the game for different reasons.
---
Launching another queen soon
---
Yes.  My primary alt is level 53.  No missions yet.  And I am now leveling another alt as well.  Will do the story with them at some point.
---
The sheepsquatch needed that datamining or well it was better than nothing, everyone still panicked the shit out of that event.
---
Yeah you need to steal them in a locked area. Turing them off only makes it not show on the map
---
Thank you for this!
---
Yea I'm calling it: buggy wrapped in a sweet glitchy shell.
---
Do uranium fever.  White springs and west teck for guns and junk... rinse and repeat.  And use grape mentats or formula p to increase charisma
---
Needing 8+ players for an event doesn't really make it more "difficult", it makes it nearly impossible. Making it so if you don't put more than is possible into 3 feed troughs doesn't make it "difficult", it makes it nearly impossible.
---
If I can't solo it, or at least accomplish something with fewer than 3 players, it never seems to work. 
---
Maybe if they make a server wide alert, it will be better. But for now? Me, myself and I can't carry the event alone.
---
"It just works"....
---
Sell them i guess
---
I’m on PS4 🙂
---
Use the looking for group tool on Xbox club. Best way to do the event
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bigeay/meta_trading_posts_are_no_longer_allowed_on_rfo76/
---
Perks do work. My bloodied plasma rifle does pretty good damage, not as good as my bloodied .50 etc but definitely good enough to use for anything other than bosses like SBQ, sheepsquatch etc.
---
I added your map alongside the others in my mod: [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/313](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/313)
---
Thanks for contributing!
---
Most mmorpg raids cant be solo'd, and none of them could be pulled off day of release.
---
The problem is guilds and grouping, not raid difficulty.
---
I would kill to have a gulper in my bar. The Drunken Gulper without a gulper is just....boring.
---
They need a frigging notification. A couple times I've seen the marker, traveled there, and the event is almost immediately failed because a level 40 triggered it by himself and we have to defend 1 lone squishy critter from a horde of monsters.
---
Other than the queen and imposter, this is one of the only things in the game that actually requires a group, and they didn't give us any way to organize one or signal everyone that it's available.
---
It spawned near the Charleston Train station along the tracks heading away from the station, but not towards the city towards the boat.
---
Lol all vendors in survival ate trap basses lol 30 shovels and 30 leathers are and some turrets bow free chems
---
My plasma gun buffed off of rifleman and tank killer, its two shot with 25% faster fire rate and +1 agility. Mix those two perks in with a flamer barrel on that thing, and nothing dies because you get the health glitch from killing them to fast.
---
There's is no in-game way to find a group. I don't want to sit on my ass waiting for both a group AND the event to start. 
---
I don't play MMOs for a reason; relying on other people sucks.
---
Old man winter mask hahaha
---
You can find the MIRV plan on one of the vendor bots. I think I found mine either at Watoga or Harper's Ferry 🤔 or Phoenix,
---
Is it back? I got my camp back from that glitch a couple days ago, thought it was patched. Still I couldn't place stuff down exactly as it was but I got the overall theme back.
---
Nah, I've seen it. Usually there's a locked door that would otherwise provide access. My guess is that the lock predates the vendor patch, and the owner has just forgotten their door is locked. 
---
That said, I saw one yesterday with the only apparent egress being a garage door with no switch, so.... Maybe some folks are just assholes?
---
You're not alone. I bought Fallout 76 to play the story, if I can't do it alone I pretty much skip it.
---
same thing happened to me once,  i picked a lock one of those drones and it gave me a bounty, i went to the first train station i could find to drop my junk and a nice high level came up to me and said "leme help you get that off,  you can loot your junk here i wont take it"
---
Yup. I don't mind doing things with other people, but they have to be capable of whatever we're doing. I even enjoy it now and then, honestly. But sitting in a group queue? Ew.
---
by the time you get all that most of the buffs wear off. IMO not worth the time using all those.
---
There is a ton in the mire, I know this little spot with a black titanium node and a view. Also a couple spots if you really like getting that mire vibe, wouldn't recommend the waterfall...had that spot day one. When the lead node became known people constantly built there, and I have yet to see one actually use the waterfall.
---
&gt;Some sort of sneaky sniper with a pipe weapon.
---
The "stealth archer" of Appalachia?
---
I've seen that one over by the soft serve.
---
Yes please! 😊
---
Woah lol I ran into some girl that said that said they made this. I didn't visit it to see if it was legit, but if this is it, that's cool.
---
Hehehe, what can I say? It's enjoyable.
---
Haha thats a good one,  people wanna sell stuff but lock their doors
---
We tried this, think the guy who was helping me had too high of agility and didnt take much for fall damage. Will have to try again with someone.
---
Call what you want, makes no difference does it?
---
unreal engine would make me wet
---
My frog IS a good frog! He DESERVES a bigger jar, give it to him Bethesda!
---
Damn, where is your camp at? Is it really worth it? I have had a couple problems with people taking spots, my first camp was at the waterfall in the mire had it on launch. Now everyone uses it for the lead and not the view, its infuriating. My new camp is now in a location that the occasional person will build a shit shack on top of but I haven't had to hit find new world more then twice.
---
After doing paradise a few times, I now no longer bother.  Just requires too many people and with no server wide notification, there won't be enough people.
---
I'm not a shotgun build, but I maxxed out the enforcer perk specifically for this reason.  I carry a shotgun for crippling ghouls that are mobbing me, then puck them off at my leisure.
---
Like monster hunter world. That would be awesome.
---
Spoke with a play that accidentally launched someone into a deathclaw den by putting the board in front of a vendor pretty funny story
---
Well it’s just a bunch of ones hitting in my opinion, i have a full Assassin Sent gear and I still get one or two Shot. I can also do it back so it’s mainly who can get the first shot
---
&gt;no way to find a group
---
Idk I mean, you could talk to people.  It's the wasteland.  Talk to people. Build a group.  Dare I say (gasp) roleplay.
---
If you didnt want to play a mmo, you probably shouldn't have bought an mmo.
---
That actually sounds like an awesome experience.
---
Should def be a perk especially with some of these weapons lol
---
Now that I think of it, I can't recall.  It is splashed across the screen during the event sometimes, though.
---
Yes, I found him at the Whitespring Friday on top of a car.
---
Lmao wow. your ass is for shitting, not talking.
---
No plan, I'd probably have it if there was. Sold a bunch in vendor.
---
Ive been server hopping since the event started a month ago. No tourists for me. Big WTF to that.
---
I think that the initial poor reception for the game helped create a community of good people. The more negative and toxic players by and large have avoided the game. Not saying it’s perfect, but there is definitely more positivity in the community as a result
---
Yeah me and my buddies have been saying this for ages. Also would like it if you could give group members privileges. Like scrapping, using stored items or even locking stuff
---
Advanced power connectors
---
Same reason people with small weiners get big trucks. The small weiners.
---
I do a pretty spot-on Doctor Girlfriend voice, so when playing the rocketsuit I just ask if 'you nice boys have any cigarettes a girl could eat.'  It usually gets a laugh.  Occasionally it gets me packs of cigarettes.
---
I would love first for my vats to work on flying enemies and all my hit registering first but this would be cool. Make the power attack do this would be cool.
---
Someone posted this awhile back. [https://i.imgur.com/X4ecqTS.png](https://i.imgur.com/X4ecqTS.png)
---
Found it on 2 chars without server hops
---
I don't melee, but not allowing the Super Sledge to have a Ground Pound attack that stuns all on ground within range is a big miss on Bethesda's part.
---
See you lost me... I have gotten as far as the conduits but even then I am lost so I end up having dark settlements cause I can’t understand how I see all these people do it when they post their photos of the lit up settlements lol my poor settlers

Get the food and bobblehead before, then mothman quest and sleep after and you good to go. I leveled from 55 to 100 in 40h with this method.

I can craft mutations so easy now i just sell 3 of them each day.

Yeah, I only did Fasnacht once, but it was fun and mildly challenging.  And everyone was in passive, so we could fire with abandon.
---
Saw a fix for this, think on youtube. Fast travel to a nearby location and run to arktos. It let's you go down the elevator on xbox. Pc's fine.
---
When the event starts, there is a global timer for 20 minutes to just start the event.  Just run around for 5 to 10 minutes along with everyone else before starting the event at ARIK4.
---
Killing non objective enemies can be very beneficial, in events like Hordes or Heart of the Swamp, where enemies will reinforce the boss monster indefinitely.
---
Exactly, I found a maze like dungeon that someone had filled with traps designed to screw you if you messed up. Fast travelling wouldn't help either because he stacked traps, so when you messed up it was big time. If I didn't have 15 END I would have lost a ton of stuff. 
---
I had a lot of fun going through it though, and at the end he was selling some good stuff too.
---
The plasma gun is extremely cheap to use in Vats. I think you are supposed to put an auto barrel on it and sneaky Vats peoples faces.
---
Very nice! I find the elder paint to be less interesting than paladin or officer
---
Found Bethesda’s support team
---
what does the flamer barrel do?
---
Both of those spots spawn the vendor as well as the responder eyebot. If you wear a uniform, police, paramedic or firebreather it will tell you if any high level enemies or threats are in the area.
---
I feel like if we’re gonna ask for more things that will affect server stability we should probably ask for something more than.....background music......
---
I don’t feel overwhelmed. I feel bored. It’s not worth completing it solo, and it isn’t interesting in groups. Voice acting and lore are good. But it plays like shit.
---
This is the workaround
---
I've been getting lag while crafting/cooking for a couple months, but on PS4. I get complete video and audio freeze for anywhere from two to ten seconds or so, then it goes back to normal. I've been getting this almost every time I craft.
---
Friend of mine does this as well.
---
That’s a great idea.
---
 **"cannot place item, intersects with an existing object."**
---
And yet when I go around to player vendors I see Fusion Reactors half way inside a concrete floor or objects sticking out of wood floors?
---
These pictures are from three different camps:
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/1OcQpBt](https://imgur.com/a/1OcQpBt)
---
&gt;My guess is that the lock predates the vendor patch
---
Did not think of that, possibly blueprinted camps and they have just dropped the new Vending Machines into it without thinking customers need access. I bet this is why :)
---
Yes. You can spawn multiple legendary 3 stars that way. Definitely benefits everyone. But when it comes to events like Scorched Earth and Encrypted, there should periods were majority should focus on DPS while some do enemy control. Once a 3 star makes its presence known, I’ve seen people stop doing DPS and unload on them when you just gotta tag it to get the loot most of the time. Encrypted has a short timer of about 10 minutes, people should be try as much as then can to stop the imposter robot during that DPS phase. I even had it chase me non stop with no help.
---
I agree with all of this, also I'd love to be able to keep blueprints of buildings I've made when I've moved camp location, even if I decide to build something completely different in the new location.
---
More than a few times I've had to scrap the building, but wanted to keep the layout for a possible future location.
---
I would love a cleave attack for whitesprings.
---
I’ve gotten the recipes and whatnot, so I’m done with it.
---
It’s buggy and laggy, and also eats more of my bullets than the SBQ.
---
Hahaha so feels like it,these challenges are getting out of hand,Bethseda don't won't us to earn easy ATOM POINTS🤜
---
Well turns it into a plasma flamer...which is badass.
---
Yes, junk 3* we can trade for scrip is fine too
---
This is awesome! 
---
Btw for anyone buying and selling at vendor stores, check out r/fo76stores. It’s a new community where you can post ads for your store or search to see who is selling on your platform!
---
😔
---
sweet gonna try it thanks!
---
I suspect your (temporary) downvotes stems from a minority of people hat don't fully grasp that Fallout has been a singleplayer game franchise for twenty years and that this is still the core audience. Bethesda knows it but seems to want to try new things - which is fine but the game lacks the tools to accomplish them. This event is just poorly designed (as of right now).
---
How long has this been a issue?
---
I stopped SBQ hunts a while back because I wasn't getting loot.
---
What's the primary effect?
---
Same here
---
Exterminator, so that sucks but the explosive makes up for it
---
Psn
---
Longtrainrollin
---
If I come to a base and there is at least one resource unlocked and one stash and work station available I will not only defend that base, I will go around repairing anything that is broken before I leave.
---
If everything is locked up I just leave, no reason to burn time, bullets, and scrap to benefit someone who seems focused on taking care of only themselves.
---
If you have a trap base with a vending machine as bait I am more than happy to introduce it to the Kovac-Muldoon, up close and obital striking distance.
---
Kill a legendary stingwing in 76 hits with 76 different weapons.
---
Win hunter/hunted ten times while naked and wielding a rolling pin.
---
Take a picture of a player in formal wear taming a wolf at midnight during a radstorm.
---
Come and join r/fo76stores. It’s a new community where you can search for items for sale and see advertisements for others stores. Could help you out!
---
All transactions including sales, crafting, modding, acquiring, trading, dropping, or whatever, means the server has to do a database check to make sure your attempt is allowed (Does USER have requirements?, etc..); and then OKs the transaction.
---
I just can't imagine why there is no bulk craft functions in game.  Duping prevention could be taken care of but would require more overhead on the server, which Bethesda seems averse to doing.  They have to do what they can to keep server costs down.
---
Try to be a bigger asshole
---
Lame :/
---
I'm Lvl 190 and just recently I got my first actual good roll on a weapon, but it was lvl 25.
---
And how's that ಠﭛಠ
---
I haven't got any drop, but I'm almost sure you can just need to learn the plan, and mod it.
---
Heads up its dps is scary and can give you the range hp health regen bug that makes it so you can't kill anything without melee if you use it to long during a session. It seems to only happen when you kill to many enemies to quickly like 5 ghouls in a second.
---
It used to be the final rank of the Big Leagues perk in Fallout 4. Dunno why they decided to simplify perks to the extent of mostly damage boosts in the game.
---
Thanks, I am on PC and this is the first time I have experienced this amount of lag at such severity. It is nearly impossible to craft/repair given the leg currently present.
---
Yeah I got this from the vendor to
---
Thanks! I always feel bad when I visit camps and see that other dwellers are selling the various little things they find that nobody wants so I finally cane up with a way to help
---
Im still seeing a lot of purchases at my store.. then again i try offer my wares at a fair price. if no one is buying, you are asking too much. (unless it is a god roll legendary.. then that will take a while)
---
Haven't noticed that from my standpoint. If anything it's more active on some servers. I think what's happening is groups are forming and server mining, triple nuke zones and events and workshops all on lockdown on some servers I've stumbled into.
---
This reminds me of a guy who found my CAMP and started blowing it up, luckily for me I had Karma, so I let him kill me, respawn at CAMP rinse and repeat until Karma set in, allowing me to one shot him with a grenade
---
Isn't there a perk that does that?  I don't play a melee build so I don't know.
---
What I miss is the penetration perk from Fallout 4.  I would sometimes take out two mobs if one stood right behind the other.
---
Pipe revolver rifle or Pipe bolt action rifle (assuming they both still double dip from perk cards).
---
If you can manage to deal with one 1\* legendary I would suggest a variation of my shotgun medic build. Wear whatever you want and face tank whatever you want. Or don't. Your choice (unless the enemy turns friendly mid-combat and you can no longer vats them - WTAF?!).
---
Rifleman or commando?
---
Isn't that what crowned bosses are supposed to be?
---
I’ll be on around 6:30 central time if anyone is still going at it
---
Also noticed it’s more reliable outside of PA, I get in mine when I’m already inside
---
Snap a photo of a SB and Fog Crawler kissing while playing the guitar naked wearing a beer hat after consuming 10 types of alcohol in 30 secs during a radstorm that is occurring at a incoming nuke location while running backwards between the hours of 11:59pm-12am
---
Awards= Uninstalls FO76 and you become the new CEO of Bethesda
---
Whitespring. Kill every ghoul you can find, which will be quite a few. 
---
Don't go charging into the clubhouse at level 45 though, draw some of them out first so you're not fighting a dozen at once. 
---
Workshops are decent too, but Whitespring is hard to beat for power leveling.
---
I had the same except mine got up to 78.
---
Heading your way
---
Best post I have seen today.
---
Oh okay. Thanks for letting me know
---
Oh my sweet summer child
---
This was a terrible idea the last time it was posted too
---
Like I said, it's been a while and im not sober lol. Idk why the downvote :(
---
I wouldn't say so, but it would have been nice to see cross platform play. We have players split between 3 platforms and from what I seen they all look active. My camp usually sees at-least 3 people come through an hour and its in a pretty remote location where people might not want to spend the caps to travel to.
---
I'd rather have a set time like 8pm EST for vendor resets. Or 9 am EST. Not this shitty talk to the vendor first, sell something first, wait 20 hours bull. Don't spare me the 4 other hours for that. Just give it one time to reset them all. Like how pretty much EVERY other MMO does it.
---
Uncommon but not rare. They spawn at top of the world and white powder winter sports.
---
same here, that's why i leave my acid extractor and water unlocked. so even if i lack what you seek, you can get something
---
If you want to run a no power armor melee build [here](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c1a46cb&amp;d=s92sf2se2ej4eu0ee2c72ir2i42a72aa2a42am2la2lu2l71ss2pa0lt2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=289cefgh)  is what I use, mutations included. Lifegiver, barbarian, ironclad, evasive, radicool, incisor and iron fist if you want to run a fist weapon. If you want to run a 1H or 2H weapon don’t upgrade Gladiator/Slugger. Just apply 3 of them for +30% damage, this is a better way to use your perk points. Bloodied Swing Speed +End/Agi/Str Gauntlets/powerfists are the best melee weapons rn imo. But if you want to run melee in PA you’ll want to use a Bloodied Swing Speed super sledge or something like that.
---
You shouldn't lose any gear or progress. There are still some glitches with quests and gameplay, but it works fine for the most part.
---
Oh man 😂😂😂😂🤦🏽‍♂️ totally ME right here!!!
---
I sort of agree, or at least differentiate legendary weapons from regular weapons, so much wasted time looking at vendors full of trash weapons and armor. The only way around it has been to search the map for the owner and see if they are higher level (for legendaries, for junk it doesn't matter as much except when shopping for flux and ultracite)
---
Even better if we can set shopping item types we are interested in and have some kind of match rating against the vendors.
---
Ha! This is awesome. Come and advertise your store on r/fo76stores! Just remember to follow the proper title format :)
---
Aargh! I really want to tame a cat. You’re incredible.
---
You should have bought it on day one. ;) 
---
It was never as bad as "they" said it was, in my opinion, and it's considerably better now than it was at launch. Bethesda seems to be dedicated to rolling out new content almost faster than I can play through it.
---
Everyone I’ve talked to has noticed how cruel it is. Makes you realize a lot of people have a lot of compassion for virtual animals
---
No thanks. I give a big NOPE to all involuntary PvP situations.
---
They patched it so badges don't drop from those events....only by completing challenges
---
You can come and advertise on r/fo76stores! You can advertise to others that you have a bar, snack shop, clinic, etc and when players go searching for that your store will pop up!
---
ESH.....wait wrong sub
---
I found some storms in the mire finally. And it only triggered the challenge when I took a targeted pictures. In my case, another player with their name in the viewfinder.
---
You may have to look in the "Notes" section of your Pip-Boy and unlock the plan.
---
Yes, it would!
---
I learned them from the Notes section but nothing appeared saying it unlocked.
---
Finaly found one at Wavy Willard Waterpark today after server hopping for 40m, so dont give up :)
---
Sadly, they have such low health, they don't live very long.  Their meows also get annoying, and they're so tiny, you hardly ever see them.
---
[Good choice.](https://i.imgur.com/C7T6jm4.jpg)  Sent him a few others, still not a peep back. [Here's](http://imgur.com/a/Yb7kG3p) a link to the album, I'll keep updating there.
---
I hope we’re gonna get something with fireflies.
---
[Here's](http://imgur.com/a/Yb7kG3p) a link to the album so far. We'll see how many I have to get to before he responds!
---
It also takes about one of each Flux I believe. When you go into the build menu under miscellaneous structures the arch should be at the very bottom it should show on the right hand side of your screen what items you will need.
---
I know! I'm so mad I didn't buy it last time. It's not available right now, sadly.
---
They seem smaller than the ones in 4.
---
I probably laughed too hard at your username, you can have my upvote
---
You can do horde events or leader of the pack in the forest, toxic valley, or ash heap. There will be a legendary enemy at the end of the event that will drop a weapon or armor at your level.
---
Thanks for trying to help but my issue is that I read the plans but the game didn't learn them. It still says that I need to find the plans and they are now gone from inventory.
---
He said that it tells him he still needs to unlock it, so it isn’t that he’s missing materials.
---
Its certainly not common
---
Have you completely signed out and sign back in perhaps even restarting your unit.
---
Patch notes say “completing Stings and Things, Operation Tidy, and campfire tales will no longer award possum badges to players who have not achieved possum rank”
---
I read that to say they should award possum badges if you’re no longer a tadpole
---
That will have to be next step. Thanks for responding.
---
Crowned bosses don't mutate.
---
I think they're intended to be more challenging than the average enemy, but I don't notice much of a difference, if any. Sometimes they have more loot.
---
Screw that.
---
Just alternating between Country Roads and Unranium Fever (is that even in 76?) on eternal repeat.
---
I have my base on the cliff behind West Tek. Every time I fast travel to it I arrive at the bottom of the cliff, and it takes about a minute to get to where my base is. It would be nice to not have to do that.
---
Yeah....I think bethesda meant to do that but it's bugged
---
If you jump on top of one you'll glitch through and see the seats or if you wait till it takes off you'll actually see the doors open and you can see the bench along with the two gunner positions
---
Collect 5 deathclaw hides
---
Out of about fifteen 3 star weapon buys, I've gotten one that I want to use. But I'm trading in stuff that is otherwise trash, so yes, it's worth it.
---
It should be common sense that, realistically, it would certainly tank server stability and performance.
---
Forest and toxic valley have enemies that spawn at a fixed level, so you won't run into anything too tough. I think the ash heap is the same way, but I can't swear to it. 
---
If you follow the storyline quests, it should give you level appropriate enemies. I know some people don't do these until level 50 because they want the weapon/armor rewards to be max level, but that stuff is all one star legendaries that you won't want to use at high levels anyway.
---
I can't believe I'm about to say this, and I promise I only know this because my little sister knows so much about it.
---
How about doing it like Fortnite (what a heinous title)? That map has been evolving noticeable for years.
---
I would but honestly, Idk if I'm a high enough level to even have anything people would want. Just some one star legendaries maybe a couple 2 or 3 stars. Nothing too great
---
All exposure is good exposure especially when it’s free! Lots of people are looking to buy legendary stuff!
---
True but unfortunately i dont even own the game. I Just rent it any chance i can get lol
---
Nope craft the cheapest and thus the lowest level one!
---
So, you're saying I should be selling all those stealth boys I pick up in my vending machine...
---
What the? I'm about level 120 and I only try to fight people around my level or above. 
---
Definitely no one under 50.
---
I found one underneath the mothman statue right outside the museum
---
They turn off if your base charisma isn’t to the lev to share the perk.
---
If you use chems, armor, or perks to get the charisma threshold needed to share, it turns off unless directly highlighting the perk in the perk menu
---
The elevator button even says 50+.
---
The event should have a lockout for any characters below 50.
---
This event should also allow team alliances.   Two teams of 4 linked into an alliance (8 man party basically) for the event.
---
I have only 5intelect, and no gun slower broking perks. So it didn't take long to me.
---
That's all it says. Turn on general subtitles in the options...
---
They were probably squeakers and haven't learned common decency as Mom and Dad spoil them.
---
Welp. I feel stupid. Lmao
---
I picked up all the bones at the dumpsters in Whitespring, right next to the enclave entrance. The place with the Mr. Handy sweeping skeletons. 
---
I've heard that not every fedora type counts. I think crumpled is good, but battered doesn't work. I had a white wolf fedora on.
---
I went to the teacups and you spawn in just in front of some picnic tables, run forward and see him or her layed out over a picnic table directly in front of you. I server hopped 4 times and it spawned in finally. Saves on caps hopping from possible spawn points.
---
Ye well I don’t wanna bother server hopping it’s just a pain will see if anyone else has him first
---
Thanks I tried that many times but to no avail. After deleting and reinstalling the game it seems to be working. Thanks again. Glad I didn't have to factory reset the ps4 yt
---
Wait. Why? If you actually translated it and aren't bullshitting that's pretty cool and not stupid at all!
---
Bethesda HQ Meeting Room.
---
Boss: So we need to make a bunch of fun new missions. What sort of thing do gamers love?
---
Worker: Well, I don't know about love, but players generally HATE escort missions.
---
Boss: Right, escort missions. Do those.
---
Worker: No, I said players hate tho..
---
Boss: ESCORT MISSIONS.
---
I just did it to another house where, luckily, teh owner was home. Took a minute to get her attention from her crafting benches but, eventually, she looked up and followed me to where I hid the gift bag.  
---
Right as I left, she dug out a mic and managed a quick "Thank you!" after i waved goodbye.  
---
(wo rolls of film (12 shots total), a super-stimpack, a nuka-Cherry, some Wine (proper housewarming after all!), some food, three things of Formula P (hi Charisma!) and  I forget what else.  
---
Make a pretty house, get pretty gifts. That's what the Overseer would have wanted!
---
I've been selling X-01 calibrated legs for 900 each. I need to start doing excavator ones, too.
---
The big difference is that Fastnacht had a bunch of steps that were done sequentially. The Project Paradise is like running three events in parallel. To get the best rewards there needs to be three independent groups, one in each habitat, until the Alpha shows up. That is more challenging to coordinate on the fly.
---
Quit, play game... Rinse and repeat til you see him in front of you. Pretty easy but ok. Good luck to ya. :)
---
So I did some experimenting because of the clam of low levels that are "pack mules". I spent 3 hours traveling from camp to camp and server to server looking for those that yielded numbers higher then 5 for weopons or armor.  I never found one. Found many low level selling non-ledgendary crap. So these so called "pack mule" are a ledgendary find as well.
---
I didn’t realize the subtitles would’ve told me this. I went through a lot of work just to hear what it was saying when I could’ve just turned on a specific setting. The whole time I was doing it. I was thinking 
---
“Let’s see what Bethesda is hiding” hoping to uncover something lol
---
guys how much iq does it take to fast travel out ?
---
Had this happened first time I beat scorched queen too. Never got the plans again.
---
Pro tip- if you’re a low level player trying to turn some profit with vending there is always junk. Steel, lead, screws, aluminum, springs etc. that almost everyone needs lots of all the time. Scavvers make bank.
---
No joy. Looks like that's a yep on the getting screwed.
---
its prob full of traps
---
Ohh bummer.
---
 3x Butcher's Bounty, Chemist, 3x Super Duper. When you log in, port to vault 76 and head south a little to the shack with those beetle things. Kill and search for their blood.  Craft bloodpacks, then craft stimpacks. End up with hundreds pretty quick, sells for \~9caps per.
---
Butcher's Bounty's useful in general, food sells quite well.
---
Some junk-scrap has value and can be sold to a vendor, tag and pick them up as you go.
---
Pick up all the rubber you can find and craft those marine masks. 3 rubber + 1 glass + 1 plastic sells for \~27 caps each.
---
The food/chem/junk weight reducing perks are obviously rather useful.
---
Why would it be full of traps lol. I don't have the time nor the patience to be that much of a dick
---
TF2 and GMOD
---
I live by top of the world and logging in I do a quick run of pleasant valley cabins ect and make about 4-500 caps right as I log in
---
I would be happier if we had loot tables and it wasn't so RNG dependent...
---
New event? Sweet. Now I get to watch everyone else complain there's nothing to do while I'm on try #37 for Formula P..... Let me drop these 37 Ultracite Knuckles plans real quick before try 38.....
---
I think I broke the upvote thumb.
---
Awesome. I know that no one wants my crap. Just come visit my camp. I made a bar with a nice view.
---
Yea that's what I mean that's fucking cool. I HAD to turn them on just to do the same thing. The next big question is, what is this thing related to? Is it just some random spawn event or is there more to it? And what about the message itself? Is it an easter egg or one clue in a line of clues? I've been wondering ever since I first encountered it.
---
Theres a couple of fixed spawns for the Fatman, one in the bottom of the vats of FEV at WestTek, another on top of the monorail track, goto Garrahan headquarters monorail station, climb onto top, follow track, theres a Fatman at the end, scrap one and mod the other.
---
Jukebox is radiant, like lightbulbs. Having a powered conduit nearby should be enough.
---
Nope. All gone. Round 2, FIGHT!
---
It's getting very early for me but I forgot to say that I put the three dots "..." because I didn't know if you were making a joke or not lol.
---
Ah I see no life aswell
---
I am just as intrigued. Anyone else is more then welcome to drop any more locations of eyebots with Morse code and I’ll go by and see if the subtitles match at least lol
---
Oh so you're approching me
---
I mean at that rate, I’d try to buy it off someone. Sorry you aren’t getting lucky, didn’t get any either so I might buy those recipes off players on the market threads. The more creatures you keep alive, the better the loot (Ideally all three have to live).
---
There’s only 5 different walls. Warehouse, Wood, Barn, Stone and Metal. Stone is probably the best looking next to barn.
---
It would make sense to have one. Especially if you spawn at random spots around your camp.
---
thats exactly what a person with multiple traps in their camp would say
---
O shit you right
---
Okay thanks :)
---
I hope you realise the irony in your comment
---
When was this a daily?
---
I just got a possum badge from campfire tales
---
My only issue other than spawning in a wall is people who have their machines in a building with the only access is walking through a  decontamination arch that is on with bo switch to shut off.  novel idea but for people like me running bloodied we don't want to loose our rads.
---
Yeah so swastikas can run rampant, like on Rust?
---
Yeah they often do. Not all the time but quite often.
---
Damn....maybe I'm just unlucky...lol
---
Except for you know, having done modding work on games dating back to Fallout 3 and having personally seen the legacy code they use. 
---
But after getting some sleep and thinking back on it here's a good one. Quest markers and objectives breaking for no apparent reason. That I know for a fact date back at least as far as Fallout 3 and they're a result of too many scripts updating at the same time.
---
Commando. I got Quad Tesla and Quad Explosive Tesla. They are both amazing with the Automatic barrel. 60 bullets of pure fun.
---
Yeah I have only played solo so far. I was concerned that playing solo wouldn’t be a viable option, but I’ve had a great time so far. Would I prefer a fully fledged single player Fallout? Of course. But if you play this as a survival, crafting and exploration game it actually has a lot to offer.
---
I usually try to let people know during a SBQ fight, but if I see one during Encryptid I just gib it. Imposter fights are already just an Alfred Hawthorne short of a Benny Hill segment, so it feels like if I pull everyone off the Imposter for long enough to tag the gutsy we just end up losing the Imposter itself.
---
As a raider, the one caveat in your post is the bag theft, and that's straight up Blackwater bandit style. On survival without my squad ill usually bag hunt (they're marked on the map) and on adventure of I find a bag I'm liable to grab it. 
---
Does it suck to be farming white spring, get ghoul swarmed, and have some dude swipe all my hardened mass? Abso-fuckin-lutely. It's also pitch perfect role play for a raider. 
---
Hopefully it becomes a learning curve, being at risk of being mugged until it happens a couple times and you either stop carrying or stop caring
---
I can't keep all 3 alive solo. I can only get one station up to rating 3 solo. :\ PUGs in Arktos are 50/50 people getting KOed by Yao Gaui and screaming on the mic or people that don't know what they're supposed to do that apparently can't hear you......
---
I'm getting bummed out with my RNG luck lately. Ever try to buy the Ultracite Gatling Laser or Plasma Grenade plans from the market? gg hf
---
I would just really appreciate some sort of loot tables at this point.
---
Same here except I bought a plan and it wasn't showing so I lost 400 caps
---
Caps at 90%
---
How about BALANCE. Everything needs balanced. There is only two types of items in this game. Top tier items and shit worthless items. There is no in between
---
As someone who has worked with people with a variety of mental health issues, including Tourette's, I have to say most in my experience are self aware enough (and embarrassed by the behaviour they can't cantrol) they'd play without the microphone plugged in... Just saying, it's probably just some idiot, who doesn't understand why he should be embarrassed by the verbal diarrhea coming out of his mouth.
---
It's also worth noting that Tourette's isn't always random swearing, it's my understanding (I'm not a doctor), that those cases are actually rare. The kid I worked with would just yell words associated with whatever was on his mind like "blue", if I was wearing a blue sweater he liked, or random sounds... there was swearing mixed in occasionally but it wasn't like the above example.
---
In addition to the pictures being very limited in size on TF2 there are also a small numbers of players at any one time (compared to Fallout 76 or any other game in its genres).
---
Ahh... So it is still kind of worth it then.
---
I’m prepared for dabbing super mutant photos
---
Yep, I don’t blame the raiders. Gotta cause chaos somehow in adventure mode ya know. If I was doing the event in survival I’d just shrug it off and go find loot again, kill or be killed. Like I said, I keep reserves for such reasons.
---
Damn your right. I guess it wouldn’t be as hard as we thought.
---
Ok thanks 
---
I found the industrial purifier in canp mcflinctock or something and a medium generator at the airport
---
I don’t think it would be as hard as one would think. In games like TF2 and Garry’s mod people can put down sprays with no affect to the game’s performance. And these sprays can even be ANIMATED GIFS.
---
If a 10+ year old game can do it, I’m sure that a game from 2018 can too.
---
You can play it however you want. I can play it how I prefer. I've been playing Fallout for over a decade.I've got somewhere around 4000+ hours in Fallout. This is a Fallout game. And while this game is online, it's not even an MMO, really, since it's not "massive", as there are only 24 people per server, presuming a server is full. Pretty often I can see a grand total of 10 people in a server. Even if a server is FULL, there aren't tons of people all at once wanting to do the same event. 
---
 Acting like I'm the only one with issues with this particular event is pretty strange, and I'm not sure why you decided to focus on me. I'm not even the only person in this thread that agrees they like to play more of as a loner.  Heck, most of the time I'm in a "group" with my brother, and we're just doing our own separate thing, until an event pops up and then we go together. 
---
 As to groups, so far as I am aware, max is 4. So unless that has changed recently? Even being in a group isn't enough. As previously said, unless you have 8+ people this event rarely succeeds. Which means you need at least 2+ full groups working together. Just "talking" to people in game doesn't work 90% of the time, either, since the audio bugs are ridiculous. I can't hear "Area" at all, and if I'm on "Auto" I can hear people in "area", but normally only like the first 2-3 words then that cuts out, too. I'm on PC, so there is no way for me to message "strangers" in the game to see if they want to do events.
---
Nope, the prompt doesn't warn you if the door has a lock... and I habitually close doors. I've inadvertently locked at least a dozen players inside level 3 locked camps (e.g. spawn points are inside, I closed the door on my way out) and locked plenty of people out of a camp's vending area too.
---
I know. I hated that effect in 4, cause you’d kill settlers by accident. But it would be useful here.
---
Melee is already op and when a hammer/sword connects irl it kinda has it's impact moment then stops. It makes sense, and I'm melee.
---
Wish I would have known this before I just wasted all this time.
---
They do roll bug fixes into the game but keep in mind these few things:
---
1. They can add new content and work on fixing bugs at the same time.
---
2. Without new content, the player base will simply get burnt out and leave.
---
3. In literally any software, any bug fix is likely to create more bugs than it fixes.
---
4. The core of the main game engine and scripting Bethesda used for this game are fairly old. That's not entirely a bad thing, but in the case of the scripting... 76 has bugs that existed in Oblivion and Fallout 3. Upgrading GameBryo into the Creation Engine has allowed for much more complicated games, which stress the scripting engine even harder. Which exacerbates bugs that existed in older games and causes slews of new ones.
---
I feel like that level 19 will but my 400 cap  ritual mask. At least it’s kinda cool looking right?
---
You should just fill all of the troughs yourself, OP. Then you wont have to worry about anyone else dying and you being liable.
---
What they said. But in case another technique is of interest: I build a 2X1 shed with no doors. One roof piece with the small power pylon on top. Wire goes through the open roof to power pylon &amp; then from pylon to wherever you like.
---
You made me realize that vault 76 citizens are all photographers trying to survive in the wasteland. There are no physicist, doctor, engineer, technician, mechanic, etc NOPE. EVERYONE is a photographer. Might just rename the game into Fallout 76 : Photography Simulation.
---
Same here. Was looking at it last night. I’m at 2/5 but have explored the entire region. I’ve been to to Wavy Willards a ton because I rhink it’s cool. Still didn’t get the check mark. Probably never will.
---
I think the difference is participation. As you said, you often show up and no one else does. If people DID show up, it'd be fine. When I've managed to get more than just me and 1 other person there, it's been great. But when no one shows up, over and over and over, it really sucks. 
---
Plus with Fasnacht people would do everything, work together, and then when the Sloth dropped everyone would tag it. Now you've got people running all over, and no one bothers protecting the animals, and they die, and everyone is trying to tag the legendary.
---
Odd though this may sound, I'd love to visit that server. I'm on PS4 and have yet to visit a single vendor that was a trap. I didn't find it amusing to be a low level player and have high level players walk up and murder me / destroy my camp... but I find the concept of traps built on spawn points quite entertaining.
---
I didnt think it was that small...
---
awesome
---
Maybe they want you to explore their camp and/or hang out rather than just showing up for vending. 
---
But I've definitely visited camps where they weren't particularly well designed for hanging out OR vending AND the vending was surprisingly difficult to locate but not in a seemingly intentional way :/
---
Same. I got so fed up with that dumb dumb jukebox being on and it only has what, 1 song, maybe 2 I can’t remember exactly. Like where’s all the classical radio songs? I could tolerate that better then just the one piano song on repeat for eternity.
---
I went to a vending camp run by a level 4 player just an hour or two ago, next to the lumber mill. I bought a couple hundred caps worth of stuff and left as he was trying to kill one of the lumberjack robots. 
---
A couple minutes later it occurred to me to go back and drop off a gift bag of stimpaks and bobby pins, but he'd logged out by then.
---
Who knows, seems perfectly logical to me that the better condition your weapon is in the more damage it deals
---
I've never had issue crashing during the event on PS4.  Though RARELY get to actually finish it because no one seems keen on even attempting to fill the lures which gets really irritating.  DO THE DANG OBJECTIVE...please?
---
I also think they don't look great indoors (although they're certainly better than the default smoky generators). I like to put mine on the roof or floating in the air above my camp via ladder. Usually protected with walls if I have the budget, but even without walls, enemies don't seem to make it up 3 flights of stairs to reach it in time.
---
Killed her already?
---
Player said (and wanted) that, Devs did not say that because it would not work.
---
epiv
---
Yup! Got some good 3* stuff from this event!
---
It's fucking insane to me that people make these posts instead of actually playing the game. It's just empty screeching.
---
Stone? Do you mean brick?
---
What the fuck are you saying
---
So you guys seem to seriously know what you're talking about with this event, so I was wondering if you could answer a quick question.
---
Does animal friend work with the predators in the event? Could you get a team of a few players and turn all the animals friendly and then just worry about the robots?
---
Vice versa. 
---
Android is much easier to develop for and much easier to get approved by Google than apple. 
---
However, there are more device variations than IOS devices since hundreds of phone manufacturers exist. 
---
I develop apps for Android and used to for iOS. I exclusively develop my small apps for Android now because it's easier and faster to get approved.
---
Class Freak is worth it if you're dealing with multiple mutations that have drawbacks that affect important stats, particularly to the point where that's worth more than putting that perk point toward something else relevant.
---
Marsupial's drawback on its own is almost pointless (nothing important uses your INT score, your base score is used for determining how many perk cards you can slot, and the two things that *do* give a bonus based on your INT are both minor and can be planned around), so in return Class Freak is just a waste of Luck perk space if that's your only mutation.
---
I love when I see that because it's typically people selling the items needed for the daily atom challenges. I'd much rather pick up whichever weapon/outfit/alcohol/etc I need if I don't already have it. The clown suit has been in the weekly challenges regularly lately for whatever reason.
---
Awesome ❤️
---
I'm so happy to hear positive experiences. here are to more!
---
It's been a while, but I thought if the team member put down the FT mat, you could?
---
Very cool. I have not had much luck with or without the heals. Never have enough people helping with the event.
---
It has probably been this way the entire time.  I didn't notice until doing events with other players.  By that time I was near  LvL 50.
---
If the goal is to find items around your level, filtering by that would be more effective than by player level. 
---
However, I fast travel to camps to look at their camps. It really doesn't matter to me what they have in the vending machines. It's rarely anything I want, but I don't want most of the legendary weapons that people sell either because I apparently have a different build than most players.
---
I made my camp inside the first of the 3 Cabins on the hillside next to Bolling Greens. Straight made that cabin mine and built around it. I just wish you could place doors where they belond on world buildings. Thatd be dope.
---
Awesome!
---
...and it fits the theme since The Doctor's Tardis was actually present as an easter egg in Fallout 1.
---
Oh, you made this! I thought it was an easter egg until your last pic. I'm high so yeah lol.
---
Bulk junk and marine tactical helmet/masks
---
the only living human npc I wanna find is Abbie.
---
this game wins hard for me because it is a unique experience constantly. if the bugs (in building especially) didn't frustrate me to take breaks, i would play more and I'm approaching 1000 hours played already.
---
As someone who has never played any fallout games before this but have played plenty of mmo's the one big problem I see is that realistically there just are not enough players online on the same server to do raids effectively. 
---
I personally don't like to raid or group, but I have looked at the map and I've never seen more then a few dozen people on the same server at the same time.  Hell, I've been on in the evening (mst)  and have seen as low as 3 other people online. 
---
You put 200-300 people on the same server you probably won't have much trouble getting groups together, however with how this game is designed I have a feeling it would be on its knees long before you got that type of density.
---
Nice!
---
Playing a strong build is not griefing.  Being pathetic and crying to the internet about strangers not being nice to you, because they're playing a video game completely as intended is pretty awesome though.  Keep that up, you're doing great.
---
Rifle/shotgun/sniper, just like I already have.
---
Never activate the shutdown code if you got weaker friendlies. They will attack enemies regardless of their strength against them. 
---
The alpha spawned in the kelp room and the friendly vile tick attacked the freaking alpha. Got one shot after it
---
Saw this yesterday. Loved the animations
---
I would like this, but I would say to make it cost a significantly higher amount of scrip as you could literally use this to make any combo that you could ever want.
---
When people got the recipes then less player will get it. I was saddened when i'm doing sheep squatch and waited 10 minutes yet no one came
---
I use a sub machine gun to “guarantee” tagging it. Since you can just spray and pray
---
Nice shot. that skin is awesome
---
Buy a second account to do challenges with.  
---
Impose yourself on other players to do challenges.
---
Had a gang of those blast my ass off with tse miniguns. I'm level 100+ but when you run bloodied and aren't paying attention when you're mending your workshop, this shit happens
---
They should add a unique bone raider skin for EACH power armor
---
One thing I don't get about the stores.   When I hover over a camp, I see things like ammo (2600) in green so in my mind it's got lots of ammo (one type or many types).  I fly in and poof, nothing but plans...
---
There is no way someone bought all that ammo before I got there.  So what are the symbols when you hover really showing?
---
3 GB vram or 6 GB? If 3 drop textures to medium.
---
anyone know how you sign in at garrahan mining for the miner badge challenge?
---
Does this cap involve perks too? If I have an armor piece with food/chem weights reduced while having full hiker and traveling pharm  both maxed, will my aid items be borderline weightless?
---
It's awesome though I got a 3 star legendary Bat from it that is good against animals, powerful power attack and reduce Ap in powerattack
---
And the next event I got a troubleshooter bat similar to the one in top.
---
Looks like Rng gave me these stuffs to destroy enemies inside it
---
Yeah, I am only looking for plans at the moment. There is always way less than indicated.
---
From my tests adding fdc pieces while having maxed thru hiker hass no effect. Same for ammo and bandolier/batteries included.
---
Man *slaps world of Warcraft on head* do I got a game for you
---
More fallout then anything in fallout 76
---
That would be awesome. I'd love to see the little shop they show when you're looking at stuff be in game.
---
The hamster's must have passed out from exhaustion.
---
It's broken. 
---
The only thing that has been marked off for me is one violent night. Nothing else will trigger.
---
Us: "The Burroughs were a JOKEEEE"
---
Bethesda: *gives Encryptid*
---
Us: Daggumit Pat Summitt.
---
I think Project Paradise is a wonderful way to meet in the middle when the damn thing works.
---
Solition 3: Take their guns, scrap them, then u have tons of steel so you don't need Grafton steel mill anymore. Problem solved!
---
It was probably just restarting automatically.
---
R/fo76stores
---
I'm happy for you but...yeaaahhh.
---
Prepare for dicks more like
---
It's just a red version of the other one lol.
---
I'm in the 160s now and have not bothered with it.  It's your game, do what makes you happy.
---
No
---
That feeling when your about ready to launch a nuke...
---
Thank the vid gods they cant throw cig butts in the yard.
---
If you have the excavator armor, you can go to horn Wright testing site 3 in the Ash heap. If you fast travel and immediately look to your left there's a hill with a bunch of iron ore on the side and on the top, there's also some lead ore too. I go there for my ammo ingredients and easily come back with 100/150 of each ore in one run, that can make you like 400/500 scrap if you have enough acid.
---
This has been suggested before but my answer is still a big NOPE!
---
No, please don't. That's the only reason I claim that workshop.
---
Doing solo? Go for the Toxic Sludge and get it to tier 3.
---
The others would die but who cares
---
You have a ahcne to get it (I got the formula P when there is only 1 friendly remaining at tier 3)
---
I would just say you have to re roll all three instead of picking just one that way your at least getting the gun you want. Vs now instead of getting say marine armor you get wood...
---
I’ve said it from the beginnning:
---
Bethesda should plan a huge multi-server-wide event over a couple weeks about a year and a half in. What would it be about?
---
Trains. While the train stations that dot Appalachia have been sitting dormant, the vault 76ers have been busy learning how to repair weapons, build camps, and defeat horrifying monsters with complex technology. After season one, they’re tired of walking everywhere. What can we do? 
---
Enter the major train event. Someone at one of the train yards hears about a code to a previously locked file on a computer. Which computer? No one knows. But we do know what’s on it: the schematics for an “upgraded” train car, complete with all the parts it would take to fix it if anything were to happen.
---
Step one: find the code pieces scattered around Appalachia. Everyone can help, looking everywhere, with clues being dropped if it gets too hard. 
---
Step 2: find the right computer and hack it. Pretty straightforward, with some Bethesda magic to make it last for a couple days to a week. I’m an idea guy, not a time-waster.
---
Step 3: collect the scrap. That could take a while, as every part takes a lot of working mechanics. After this, you have to shape and form every part for every train. This could take a couple weeks or so.
---
The end result? Working trains. Not fast travel trains, but trains you can actually hop on and off, that run the rails and get you places. It’s not fast traveling so it’s not game breaking, but it could allow people to think how to get to places in terms of railroads, rather than just walking or fast traveling. 
---
Just my two cents, since rails exist and all.
---
Yea I’ve seen some deathclaw pets and even a mirelurk king I took pictures with it.
---
Ill get your Fixer to Level 50 I have the plan want it?
---
Yeah, I personally don't think it would be that bad at all, although it would definitely need downscaled. Although, I don't know if it makes any difference in the graphics of the two games and engine difference.
---
I'm swiping a sword or axe left and right, it should be anle to hit more than one thing
---
In addition to the perks mentioned serendipity is good and also consider a lead lined backpack if your not in your power armour and your in melee distance of ghouls
---
Sounds like a good thing, to me. I normally just shoot stuff in the leg myself, so everyone can get exp and loot.
---
Signed.
---
How do you loot check when something isn't dead yet?
---
Because Fortnite actually updates their game consistently like any other big online game. Have you looked at the patch notes for 76? It is always surprising to me how sparse the updates are and they aren't even a weekly thing.
---
No idea! Weird.
---
but they're still using the same engine, it'll change for Fallout 176 in 20 years
---
If you are on xbox, you are welcome to join me sometime.
---
Loot Check is done automatically.  The player is unaware of it.  It SHOULDN'T activate until the mob is dead, but it is...
---
Honestly, 4500 damage is already possible. How many enemies would you like to get at once?
---
The Sheepsquatch has the ability to stun all on ground within range, so there is no good reason why a SuperSledge doesn't get the same treatment.
---
I just started playing this game 3 days ago, and I've seen multiple nukes each day. My first encounter with that "quest" to get out of the blast zone triggered while I was still taking my time making my character.
---
Maybe it is just server RNG, but I legitimately thought this thread was going to be about *reducing* the frequency of nukes. lol
---
"Try to survive online one hour without server crashing".
---
I had the same on PS4 yesterday. Not on a team, got disconnected, followed a "friend" back in, and after about a minute my workshops were suddenly marked as being still mine. This is a huge improvement for me. Very glad that Beth are working on letting us rejoin when we have no "friends"
---
I mean i can but yeah. I see way too many people on this sub post the most obvious  stuff and it slowly starts to get to you.
---
Great work mate! Thanks!
---
Are you on Xbox? And if so were you doing this in a nuke Zone around White Springs for over an hour, about an hour ago? It's so thank you!
---
Nice job bud :)
---
Have you gotten a single hit with that username?
---
I have a full set and none of my weapons weigh more than 1.5 each, most weigh less than 1. I keep them all on me so my stash box is free for other things
---
Maybe save up instead and purchase it. Or check OfferUp I know for a fact you’ll find it IF you life somewhere decently populated. Or craigslist yeah.
---
TYTYTYTYTYTY
---
Wait. You got a Stimpack Diffuser? HOW?!
---
Lvl 19 probably doesn't have 400 caps
---
Not that kind.
---
I’m not pc but if there’s many people using certain ones I’m sure you can. But I’m p sure they make it so it’s just qol stuff and non game breaking shit ig.
---
3. Classical, Vault 76, and Nukashine Speakeasy.
---
I recommend pacifist mode to avoid that kind of assholes, but also... Nuked WS seems to be more of an asshole zone than most other places. Sometimes you end up with nice people who let everyone tag and runs as a group, but most often it is just bad there.
---
Just stupid kids. Should ignore / block &amp; continue enjoying the game.
---
I’d say you’re looking in the wrong place for friendly players. I’ve met many on Xbox but not at a nuked WS. That situation attracts the players you’re describing.
---
Not me. Not til I get paid what im owed for all the challeges you can't complete.
---
It is a rare one, so chances are better if you managed to keep all 3 friendly animals alive.
---
One specific server or all servers?
---
Yeah I've also seen that for myself, I run 3 levels of thru hiker and noticed that adding even 1 FDC piece did nothing.
---
Wonder how many people haven't actually noticed this.
---
Yeah absolutely, that's what I do now, walk around with all my weapons and save my stash for junk.
---
I see the opposite and I am a PC user.  While all generalizations are false... Teenagers almost always own a console before they own a computer good enough to play FO 76... Just saying...
---
This. Meanwhile spot lights have been borked from day 1
---
You're right.  I apologise and thank you for bringing it to my attention.
---
Lol it's a random drop. So you can get it at the first time, or after 250 times or never . It's a thing of personal luck.
---
Hard to imagine a studio of 100 being small but I believe cdpr has around 800.
---
Oh, I did. I just hopped servers because I just didn't feel like bothering with it. I got plenty of legendaries to sell/scrip, so I'm not upset or anything. More....disappointed?
---
Funny thing, I usually see these kinds of posts on weekends. My guess is kids.
---
No...I have a friend who traded for the Plan to make them, which I believe is a random reward for the paradise event.  He gave me enough to finish my medic badge
---
The Arktos Pharma event, Project Paradise, has the plans as a reward.
---
You know, I was 99% certain I already was until this post, which made me look. Big derp on my part. Thank you for bringing it up though.
---
Oh man that sucks.
---
Being older than a teenager, I'm not sure if I should feel ashamed or not, haha.
---
Yeah, I still get them too. Still seem to be somewhere between 1 chance in 6 or 8 (roughly 12 to 16-ish percent chance I would say) to get one from a repeatable or campfire tales, but the chance is still there, as long as you are a Possum. And yes, sometimes you get a long dry streak, it happens.
---
someone quote this to BGS
---
Stone foundations do it too, so it's got nothing to do with wood foundations. This is simply misinformation.
---
I don't get this at all either. There are a ton of NPCs in the game, there just aren't human NPC's. Drives me nuts when someone says Fallout 76 has "no NPCs" ...
---
Please?
---
This happens to me with all kinds of flooring...
---
Honestly don't think people will be hurt by the loss of one person's business. Lol. They can use whatever they want to build their camp. You can always just go to the nearest fast travel and walk like the rest of us
---
Got it on my first successful try, which was my second overall try.
---
What platform are you on? If its PS4 I can possibly help you clear it again tomorrow.
---
no clue, but at least you posted a pic,  unlike this guy   
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bt4wih/found_blinking_blue_light_at_aaronholt_holmstead/
---
I'm a casual Xbox player, so I don't server hop as often as I should. I've definitely seen a drop in nuked drops, and events are fewer. But like I said I'm not as quick to jump around like most players I feel.
---
No. It's not going to help the servers to post images on our walls, don't get me wrong I would love to have at least one photo framed, but it's a terrible idea for server stability.
---
Why can’t we? They’d need years to program that. It just isn’t worth it
---
than the qustion is wich is first and which is last. U have also Chems like Psychotats which has 25% reduction and so on
---
Lol. No. For some reason I don't seem to find them much right now
---
In the time it takes you to write on your notepad you couldve just warped yourself to the closest location and walked over. But sure let me start my camp over cause some of you cant warp again or enter PA to escape.
---
Bethesda need to sort this, just have the fast travel point on the edge of the camp boundary or something. 
---
Also.. you can already see info on what they basically sell, but please separate armor/clothing, and I’d rather know how many of the weapons and armor are legendary. Totally not interested in spending caps to visit a camp with 20 junk non legendary weapons.
---
LOL! Me too. I added "Please to be closing the door" today. Still found it open. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Yeah, if ur ps4, i could possibly give you some mats next weekend. So you dont have to sit a t george junkyard for a solid day!
---
Late night holiday weekend and here I am expecting kindness and civility. Clearly, something is wrong with me.
---
Lol. But he does have a point. We teenagers are more likely to have consoles and are, as much as I hate to admit it, generally more likely to be assholes. Lol
---
That’s really nice of you! But I’m stuck on PC these days, thank you so much though!
---
I spent a good 10 minutes killing the alpha sheepsquatch with two level 30s and I legit got the ghoul wood armor you mentioned.
---
Gaming PCs are not cheap.. So, at least you saved 10% by switching to \[Gun Shot\]
---
At some point we should have welcome mats, or spawn visitors where the owner spawns. Until then I've put musical instruments over the spawn point so people can warp out.
---
Everyone here is so nice! Thanks so much but I’m on PC unfortunately, I really appreciate it though!
---
My single vending machine is placed outside my CAMP, on its own foundation, with ramp access for those needing it, no punji boards in sight.
---
If all your customers get stuck under the floor and cannot reach your machines they may just go elsewhere.
---
I feel like the servers wouldn’t be able to keep up with that but let’s hope Bethesda proves me wrong
---
This is what I do. Again because I want to help, as it means ppl can easily get a tag in. I will go round each mob and focus on their legs. Though it can be difficult if there are lots of ppl crowding around. I still think it's the most useful thing I can do with my build. 
---
However I wrote a post the other day on this specific topic and one of the replies I had, was that for someone using an instigating weapon this can be annoying as all the mobs aren't at full health. Which I can see their point but you can't ever tell if someone had that that so what can you do...
---
Cant enter the PA always as its cant be placed. Alot of camps are in the middle of no where. Maybe cause its your camp make it accessible if you want to sell? I write down who you are so I don't come back ever. Not wasting my time cause you cant make a camp right.
---
Apparently Fallout 4, where trapper armor was introduced, didn't have shadowed, and it doesn't appear it does in 76 either (raider armor also doesn't appear to have shadowed). The only stealth related mod that it has is Sleek, where it gives you "5% faster stealth speed" which I assume is just 5% faster movement speed while crouching/or at least in stealth, which if that is the case, then having speed demon will negate any benefit from that effect entirely, making the mod utterly pointless. Also, after checking several vendors, each of them offer shadowed mods, but not one ever offered shadowed raider or trapper armor mods, but they did offer shadowed for everything else, along with deep pocketed, pocketed, strengthened, ultra-light, and etc. They were pretty much carrying everything BUT shadowed for those 2 armor types. So it pretty much seems like shadowed mods simply do not exist for raider and trapper...
---
Getting those plans is easy. If you think it's hard, I wouldn't bother with the rest of the game.
---
???
---
Kill the sbq with a commie wacker while naked, intoxicated and wearing a traffic cone on your head.
---
Btw Bethesda why the hell do you give us daily challenges to get drunk but not allow us to wear a traffic cone on our heads, have you never been drunk?
---
Been there myself. At least the can't kill you then. 
---
Good luck and I hope you run into better people in the future!
---
If one of my friends is on the server.
---
This really sounds complicated. I for myself have not yet joined in the event. I heard that you have to be a bunch of player and I have never seen more than two actually going for it.
---
Little off-topic question: Watching your video it looks more pleasant to play than on my settings. Did you change the FOV or something?
---
Why are people so annoyed by showers? I don’t own one so its really neat to lose all rads
---
I'd love for it to be weekly. And up the amount a little. Like maybe 200 a day. It's so easy to get 150 in a few hours, so if I play for more than that on a weekend, I end up with a bunch of stuff I can't even scrip, plus all the crap I hoarded for months lol
---
tomorrow will be 
---
psn k-o-d-a-m-a
---
Getting stuck in foundations isnt the builders fault. Love that you "wont waste your time" says the guy keeping a journal of "poor camp builders"
---
Rad scorpions
---
You can transfer items to other toons to sell scrap.  No need to wait 20 hours.
---
I just noticed it last night, and I feel like it HAS to be new cause I'm around that area fairly often.
---
For someone who doesn't care what i think you sure keep trying to justify it. Never asked you to change build.
---
Second question. Do you know a guaranteed spot where rad scorpions spawn that is not middle mtn cabin?
---
I think this would be cool, maybe they make it so the displayed effect can't be changed but you can add and or reroll the 2 other stars
---
I often wonder if I'm being too nice too lol Everytime I see multiple stars legendary I would waved other players but then they would try to kill it before others showed up. But I kill it without letting other knows, I'd feel bad lol I play on PS4 and so far 99% of everyone I met had been super nice or cool
---
How do you do that?
---
This happens with all foundations. Jump when you spawn and you'll land on top of the foundations.
---
Quite a rude and useless comment but ok.
---
Good idea.
---
I’m not sure if this is the best way to fix, but I have stopped playing because of this.
---
If I had time to log in, I spent my time doing daily chores and not actually playing.
---
So its my fault you built a camp that is bugged and gets people stuck? Yeah I'm not going back. If you traveled to camps and got stuck yourself you would see its mostly wood foundations that you spawn into that cause the problem. You could then say to yourself "I have wood foundations and nobody buys my stuff" Maybe then you would change your layout. Its your shop. Do what you want and I'll do what I want by not bothering with you until its fixed. There is a work around and if you don't want to experiment then I dont want to get stuck again. Its your choice as the seller.
---
Yes so much this, hows my poor buffrog supposed to lift in that tiny jar.
---
Make a new character name it whatever you , make a friend if you don't already have  in game. Ask them to help move your stuff around. Or spend like 15 bucks and buy another account
---
yeah, the next time that i have the stamina for camp-building. My current camp, the one that the tardis is parked outside, took me almost 8 hours....
---
I definitely won't let it discourage me, despite the fact that I'm weirdly antisocial.
---
Unfortunately no... The Bunny wants a small place to feel safe.
---
In reference to the first part of your post, my brother once told me, back before I’d ever played any Bethesda games, the bugs in Bethesda games are half the fun. Lol. He said, “Every time a new Elder Scrolls or Fallout comes out, I get it at launch so I can be one of the first to hunt down the bugs.” I’m right there with you. Some of the bugs are fun to encounter; others, not so much.
---
Come and see it then :)  
---
my username is Crazymalkavian
---
Same lol
---
I don't remember it! What was the easter egg?
---
Hahahaha no worries mate
---
\-The lack of people can be easily fixed by server alert (like encryptid, there are many people here, same for SBQ)
---
\-Never go to this kind of event with junk if you are afraid to loose it
---
\-If enemy one-shot you, there is something wrong with your build: add some defensive perks and work on your damage resistance  (the only exception is the Imposter, which is, indeed, made to force you to evade attack)
---
\-Drop... well yes, drop are not good. but we can get scrips out of them ;)
---
This is probably the case, I have a Two Shot M79 that does 434 damage when a normal one typically only does 200 and some change.
---
I remember that name!!!! Unfortunately it is late right now, so I won't get on. But I'll add you whenever I do
---
My FOV slider is set to 120. My PC is also not bad. Running a gtx 2060.
---
That's probably the 6th trading sub that exists now. That's ridiculous.
---
you may be better off finding an addictol out in the world. or if you find one cheap enough from a player vendor you can buy it
---
Have you seen the loading times in this game? After 15 seconds you'd be flying over a sheet of paper basically.
---
AAA, I'M ON PC I CAN HELP!!!  
---
I'm a bit too OP with my setup so combat got boring anyways and I'm now role-playing as a traveling cook giving people all over the map nice food.  
---
So if you're struggling but have enough crafting mats, I can help getting you through the enemies. I used to be always over-stocked on mats because of a ''secret yet super simple'' meta I use to get everything I'd ever need, but since I don't combat that much any longer I'm not sure I'll have everything you might be missing but I can definitely give you some of the stuff you might need to make the entire armor.  
---
Will wait for reply while in-game so I can add you and help out.
---
I included 50+ cause that was the cut off point. Most players in this case we're over 120.
---
Found it! Its a witch hat though btw. Still cool. Thanks for the effort :)
---
I didn't pester them, I didn't even manage to get into the trade menu with them.
---
OH HELLS YEEEAH
---
I’m quite happy to hunt for the materials myself but help in getting back down there to get the plans would be AWESOME
---
Cause I can still buy ammo you dick.
---
&gt; treasure
---
No, there's only one treasure map location marked on that map, on another there's only two. :(
---
im guessing it is a glitch, because the same blue light is next to the turrets in Arktos Pharma's basement in Biome A B and C
---
Yes please! Imagine the abominations from mothership zeta running around the woods, terrifying!
---
Thanks, mate. Will try the fov. My PC is not the newest though :D
---
Must have just been his. I'm still running fine.
---
Brilliant. I'm glad my suggestion helped. I look forward to following Harold's further adventures. By the way, what platform does Harold live in?
---
I've done it once and saw a perfectly healthy glowing bear jump into a fight with an alpha and promptly get squished.
---
Basically the TLDR of me making this post is that I wanted to see if this was normal, the only reason I bought this game is cause I'd heard to many stories about the great community and I wanted to meet people, but tbh it's been a shit way of meeting anyone. Anyone nice is extremely young and the rest are just dicks so far. Someone even blew up my vending manchine cause he didn't like that I was selling my spare ammo for one cap and he had a vendor nearby selling for two. It's just a lot of annoyances I really didn't anticipate for.
---
Melee is already op. My build is far from perfect and I two-shot or one shot most of the mobs, aside from the cryptids (gulpers, anglers etc) with a not perfect weapon. 
---
I'm pretty sure there's no need to give a boost.
---
This happens to 90% of camps I travel to. The key is where you spawn in. If there’s a floor there, you’re gonna get stuck in it unless you jump out of it as it’s loading in. That’s why I build now off to the side of my camp radius so players spawn right around the front steps. It seems like the only way I know to prevent this. 
---
Or just keep adding nearly everyone you encounter to your binder
---
Theres a workaround to getting unstuck but you are too good to be bothered. Since vending has come out its all i do and getting stuck is rare. Getting so stuck i have to warp again even rarer. You dont want to shop there thats fine just dont make posts and comments implying people dont know how to build cause of a faulty game mechanic or expect people to redo their entire camp cause you choose to pass judgement over jogging to someones camp. Not a good look, friend.
---
That's what I'm thinking. Could be a placeholder for new content.
---
I personally use concrete now because it fits more the style of my camp. So I have no issues with this. But I have met plenty of people who are just as happy to spend a cap to fast travel and take the scenic route to the vendors. Having wooden foundations isn't the end of the world
---
At least you can launch 3 nukes at once
---
I imagine that only on the Savage Divide object encounters we get to see the raider pa right?
---
Personally I'd disagree. We have very few events that need groups and I'm glad that we have some mixed in.
---
For me the problem is that I have no idea when the events start unless I'm constantly watching the map. Only encryptid has a notification.
---
Finally a reason to vendor trade holostapes!
---
Got it first try so it's random, make sure you check your backpack skins after each run. Sometimes that game doesn't even tell you that you unlocked it
---
I'm glad you do too.
---
Personal playlists would be totally sweet, wouldn’t even be mad if i had to collect records in game, would be awesome trade items.
---
in the other games there are radio stations still playing the same songs 200 years later, there is a free states event called always vigilent at the radio towers around the map where you have to protect an eyebot while it makes repairs, in fallout 4 the classical station was a cover for the institute maybe the chinese were using the clasical station to transmit information to their own people they do have a hidden base under mama dolces
---
Most of the lights don't need to be wired, they just have to be within ~2 "floor tiles" of a wall or ceiling mounted floor connector. As for wiring between floors, you can connect a wire through the metal mesh flooring, and after it's connected use the "Replace" function on the floor to change it to something else. 
---
My shit's not fancy, but if you want an idea on how to power your camp without too much difficulty just log onto my server next time you see me online and I'll give you a tour or we can team up and I can help you upgrade your own camp. My xbox GT is the same as my reddit name.
---
Yeah. Sorry about that.
---
Thing is there isn't any easy way for people to find out where people spawn in at their C.A.M.P to rectify it which is why since player vending and before, people have been asking Bethesda for doormats to have control over that. Not the camp owners fault when it is an issue that could be rectified by the game studio. 
---
Instead of blaming the players, why not do something constructive and add your voice to the rest to get Bethesda to fix it?
---
You could actually find the Tardis, but if you moved close to it, the light on top of the police box started swirling and it faded away.
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Unusual\_Call\_Box](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Unusual_Call_Box)
---
Think its called knife point...Raider Camp out by Pricket Fort.
---
lol.. owed.
---
They have a base under Mama Dulces, can you access it?
---
Yes 100% it stacks, I have seen it tested in videos. The more pieces you have the better it works.
---
Thank you for the feels.
---
You have to make it fun. Grab yourself a bottle of your favorite liquor and pour yourself a shot every time it crashes. It's a great drinking game.
---
you claimed a workshop which opens you up for pvp in adventure mode, probably made that 212 cream his jeans when he saw you hanging around there for 2hrs straight collecting stuff.
---
Chance that we might. A long time ago I interacted with the one at the converted munitions factory and it said "You can't do that while in Power Armor." Probably just a bug but we can dream.
---
Mate I’d be dead by the end of the night lol
---
Perfect that’s exactly what I wanted to know
---
it's faster to rebuild/rework your camp to avoid the travel issue than wait for bethesda...
---
visitor arrive at the center of your build zone (where you put your C.A.M.P the first time)
---
Ironclad, Barbarian, and Evasive reduce the damage output, you can only get away with perks like Dodgy and Serendipity.
---
I have no confusion on the meaning of free speech and what is and isnt protected as such. I'm sure that whatever it is you think it means is just great though.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
My issue is already resolved right now until they brink fast travel mats. They spawn under my camp. I have it posted as Update 2.
---
Also does harder to detect make a difference when you have 5 bit of chameleon. Is it better to go for chameleon/sentinel or chameleon/cavaliers or chameleon/ harder to detect
---
I remember the old days of stomping around in mismatched power armor cause everything took a million springs and I didn't know about P Smith. Play how you want.
---
Thats what i said, have them on the waist.
---
You misspelled collateral damage there
---
&gt; Purchase atoms with your credit card.
---
I've hear that that one is actually bugged.
---
The post about the guy who goes around shitting on beds inspired me to leave bags on porches and light it up with a flamer.
---
Even then, something like that sounds simple.
---
Hmm should we switch it to edibles or bong hit each crash.... at least you won't die, you'd eventually just past out for the next 18hrs lol
---
You'd be so chill about it all, you won't even mind the crashes. You'll probably just giggle and enjoy the game way more.
---
May or may not be a popular idea... but I would love if we could take an item and pick the effect we want.
---
Example I have bloodied on a chest I can pay scrip and choose vanguard.
---
Or I have +1 luck I can change it to +1 strength.
---
However make it costs a lot of scrip... 100s make me grind for it but let me earn and build my perfect set of gear.
---
Or let us craft the armour set we want and buy the legendary effects we want on it.
---
I'm not a fan of random loot I like a clear path to reward even if it is a huge grind.
---
Now those who make their bread and butter trading or selling the perfect god rolls may lose business but I don't care. I personally won't trade item for item because see too many people get scammed and most want 10s of thousands of caps for gear.
---
Let us earn what we want and even the playing field.
---
I hit 6000 last night.  (I've only ever spent ATOMs once, for some cammo paint).  How much do others have?
---
After reading this i just remembered you can deliberately cripple enemies. Might even save my life some time. 
---
Also op, you're the mvp. Keep doing what your doing
---
I've been pretty lucky in so far as I haven't lost anything major due to crashes. 
---
I just shrug them off in all honesty. I'm kind of used to it. I just treat it as a good excuse to put the kettle on!
---
I don’t really think this is a good suggestion for a casual player who doesn’t get to play much every night, if they don’t have time for one account selling and stuff they won’t have time for 2 accounts and constant switching to trade with friends
---
Tf2 downloads everyone's sprays onto your computer 
---
so you get a folder of memes and porn saved as vtf files
---
Second account is only needed if they don't have a friend. The other option is logging in every day
---
That appears to be correct.  The record for that encounter is called "Raider's Last Laugh" and the only regional condition is "Savage Divide"
---
The game only counts your base charisma when it comes to perk sharing, so mutations and armor buffs won't help. Also, if you get a disease that lowers your stats that can cause the card to become unshared until you cure it.
---
That's hardly the fault of the CAMP owner. I don't know why that's the person you're trying to punish for things entirely outside their purview or control.
---
No.
---
Obviously *some* bugs have priority, but since no program of non-trivial size is ever bug free saying "fix bugs before content" is just another way of saying "no new content".
---
That's poop :/
---
Hopefully the berzerker effect gets a buff, would be a really fun play style!
---
You were totally right. I completely forgot that quests  almost always give 3 addictions from quests and workshop quests. I have two addictions now and no addictions. :)
---
good question, this needs a reply.
---
I know this isn't going to happen but damn it would be cool. A nice alternative might be for loading screens to include team mates screenshots.
---
I’ll check it out right now because I still want the food in case I run into a table without addictol the quests rewards.
---
Turn on pacifist mode.. Then you cant hurt other players thus saving you from this kind of asshat.
---
I just reload the game- I'm not a fucking crybaby on the internet...
---
and junk lower players don't seem to stash their junk as often and can have like 50 pounds of junk on them 
---
They are basically a junk pinata
---
After logging in the initial reload is slow often, bit that's easily fixed. Sometimes though I swear that my speed is back to normal, and I have to restart the game entirely to fix it.
---
Scrapper + wiping out Welch = a ton of steel.
---
Rifle Gaming has launched two at the prime before. I believe it just heals the SBQ but doesnt spawn multiples of her
---
Are you sure it's not your internet that's causing the issue? I'veplayed probably 20 hours since the last patch, and the only crash I can recall was on the first day when the game crashed trying to get into the new event.
---
yeah if you go into the managers office in mama dolce's there should be a keycard on the desk, then you want to go out the back of the factory and look for a large pipe along one side is a sliding door that you can open and inside there is a locked door (needs to keycard to open) that takes you into the base, there are liberators inside but all below level 10, this youtube video should help https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl1JBa-nAQc
---
Just don't fast travel or spawn at arktos pharma and it won't happen watch riflegamin's videos he explains that all you have to do is not go directly there just spawn or fast ravel near then walk and it will work it did for me at least
---
Give it to the claw weapons, you could slash through multiple targets
---
Thanks for the info I have had that key card for months and could never locate where it went
---
Yeah I can't get any of these music challenges to trigger, very frustrating.
---
 Many many times. I see more 2 double or triple nukes there than nuke on whitespring which annoys me
---
Sorry man, I was asleep, hmu when your oh
---
Except it's not wood foundations. It's every foundation. How it works is you fast travel, the camp isn't loaded in yet., you spawn on the actual world floor, and after that any kind of foundation loads in. If the difference in height of world vs foundation that you spawned in is little you get moved on top of the foundation. If it's to big then your stuck. Not the players fault by any means.
---
I think there's something more to this - that's not strictly true for sure, it seems from my testing that it varies, I have definitely found the aid type at all 3 and also the junk type
---
What TrainerSeb said. I never got the plan, Check my backpack skin and I can craft it.
---
Yeah that was disappointing, I only get to decorate with the stupid American flag 😢
---
check the Raider, Responder, and Free State vendor bots at whitesprings they are the ones at armors, you have to buy and learn sturdy armor first before they show up, you could also check player vending machines
---
Unfortunately the map data were exported pre- that patch and re-exporting is another 14+hrs on time for my PC, so I can't tell you
---
I mean, I have fun with it as is - last night I was racing around in my underwear with a Beserker's Gauss - but if I get hit once I'm insta-crippled toast.  A bit more of a competitive edge certainly wouldn't hurt!
---
I agree with all except for the leveled characters. Let low levels come. I was level 24 when I first did the event. Now I'm level 42 and out of roughly 30 tries, I have only failed about 5-6. More often than not any extra help is better than no help.
---
&gt;so we all don't spend our precious 3-day holiday weekend gaming time losing Project Paradise again.
---
not everyone playing this game is in the USA
---
I’m on PS4 and I hardly crash at all... maybe if I play for hours and hours I’ll crash once during that time, but usually never.
---
they fix all that and energy weapon are now strong
---
Lead - Lucky Hole Mine down in the deep southern edge of the savage divide. Also, check for weights at all the places that have exercise equipment, like the Charleston Fire dept and the residential section of each silo.
---
Steel - equip scrapper and go somewhere with a high number of super mutants of mole miners. Blackwater, Summerville, Grafton Steel, etc.
---
Acid - Hemlock Holes workshop has 3 nodes you can harvest, and there's several other nodes scattered around that you can camp on if you want slow, steady production. I also seem to find lots of players selling it for 20-30 caps per bulk stack, so check them out as well.  Oh, and run the campfire tales event. It's filled with bloodbugs, and their proboscis scraps to acid. You can probably get 30+ in the time it takes to do the event.
---
Dr Who meets Fallout? 
---
https://youtu.be/Adk1ujjmguo
---
i must have spent an hour inside the building looking for the keypad before another player showed me the entrance
---
It's not over complicated. It has few very easy and simple mechanics, but the player base has been thought in all previous Fallout games that the quests/events mean nothing and you should always go for the legendary enemy.
---
It's also not just an escort quest. It has two phases. 
---
Phase 1, gather materials. Very easy and simple. 
---
Phase 2 is the escort/defense phase. Just kill the mobs before they get to kill your defense target. Very easy and simple.
---
Some of the defense targets are very weak, but even tier 1 wolf can be kept alive. All you need is a level 50+ character with decent gear perked for tanking and damage. The wave enemies are nothing special and can be killed even with non legendary weapons. 
---
Sure if your play style is .38 pipe pistol cowboy, then you will have serious difficulties to kill the enemies and you really should not be in level 50+ dungeon event. 
---
If players would even bother to read the event messages and targets, the whole thing would be so much simpler. Many players have no interest in reading any quest/event information and only go bashing everything. Then coming here to complain and say the event is stupid and too difficult, not realizing they are the reason the event failed.
---
I am not advocating Bethesda's garbage servers continuing to be complete garbage.
---
However this is what we have to work with, trying to argue it is fine to do something because a better made system from the ground up could handle it easily is disingenuous. The servers hate huge amounts of things happening all at once, and hates huge lists of items. When they improve the servers then we can go crazy adding large amounts of stuff to the world. But doing so in the inverse order does not work so well.
---
&gt;	Grab glowing stuff and throw it into a container as quickly as possible during a time limit? Then make sure weak ass mobs don't die? Sounds enthralling.
---
To be fair, one can be as glibly dismissive of *any* quest mechanics  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_\/¯
---
Visitors spawn next to the spot where you originally placed your camp device, so moving it doesn't help.
---
No. 1 price is all you need. There is no difference.
---
That's the Sheep squash
---
Sheepsquatch
---
That's the sheepsqautch that's exactly how that mission goes level up more and do it with more people if you want to win
---
There's a bug right now where melee VATS won't hit flying targets like bugs, but I think pretty much everything else you mentioned has been addressed/fixed.
---
You can tag the Alpha and then go back to defending your target. 
---
If you have two guys defending, one goes to tag Alpha and comes back, then the second one goes to tag Alpha and comes back. It takes 10-20 seconds depending where the Alpha is compared to your defense target.
---
ok thanks at least knowing that now if i move my camp i will be able to plan a head for visitors
---
Yes! I know it’s a game, but it’s weird to be entirely surrounded by a mob of ghouls and a swing of a giant flaming sledge only hits one. Meanwhile, I’m getting slugged by enemies standing 15 feet away.
---
My junk is shit and toilet paper and it was meant for you anyway
---
I try to do the same when it comes to legendary enemies, but I'll tag them first with a pea shooter *and then* use an emote to flag people over. That way if some a-hole one shots it I'll at least get some loot.
---
I think literally within the first ten nukes of the game, 3 were launched on prime and crashed a server at the time
---
Ah oke thanks, yeah I was really confused, all the other monsters in the area are level 5 till 15 so I assumed it was a roaming monster and I had bad luck...
---
And when you server hop there's 3 walls that previously couldn't be placed floating
---
That's true, it's the same with the scream of a deathclaw. That sucks when you get stun in the air
---
&gt; Are energy weapons still hot trash? 
---
They have fixed those somewhat, but when compared to ballistic and melee, unfotunately yes. My two shot laser pistol breaks from 200% condition after like 200 shots while having only 50 dmg which means it takes about 20-40 shots to kill lvl60 scorched. Meanwhile I can one hit kill lvl60 supermutants, moleminers, major gutsys and others with my instigating 3claw-deathclaw gauntlet when having melee perks. The game really needs energy weapon perk cards, and more durable energy weapons (Except my gatling plasma is really durable, so the issue seems to be with laser guns only)
---
&gt; Do plasma Gatling still randomly do weird shit? 
---
Depending on what kind of weird shit, if you mean suddenly stops firing for no reason, firing rounds that disappear, firing 100 rounds extra (which is not bad) and so on.
---
&gt; Are plasma rifles, harpoons, etc still unable to hit things at short/close ranges? 
---
This is fixed. At least I haven't had any issues
---
&gt; Does VATS still ignore hit % randomly? 
---
All the time. VATS seems to be the most broken thing in game. For example 95% change to hit with sniper rifle is more like 10% change, 100% VATS accuracy while not in combat is non existing legendary effect and unfotunately also the most common you find. If enemy is moving sideways you 95% means 1%, BUT sometimes for example my gatling plasma has managed to hit flying scorchbeast with VATS which is kinda surprising. And too many times 95% change with shotgun from melee distance misses. And melee almost never works on VATS
---
&gt; Are scorchbeasts still immune to VATS while flying? 
---
No, thank the Divines!
---
&gt; Does armor/underarmor you wear under powerarmor still reduce the DR/ER? 
---
Not that I'd have noticed, and my even better, my refrigenerated backpack's effect works while on powerarmor (food's spoiling rate is much longer)
---
I wish people would just quit spouting random bullshit as fact when it comes to this game. 
---
Chances are those of us who actually play 76 properly have debunked your Shit theory / free karma grab.
---
Level to level 50 without leaving Vault 76.
---
Great map! I knew a lot of them, now even more. Thanks.
---
Reading the poster multiple times didn't fix it, BUT talking to the robot in Dolly Sods a million times just triggered the Stings and Things quest. I'm doing it now and hopefully it will work...
---
You may not be a crybaby on the internet but you are a cunt
---
Definitely not it’s the only game that does it
---
Yeah screw all the regular players who enjoy hopping on for a couple of hours after work or school, they don't deserve any repeatable content. And while your at it make sure every legendary drops of me a Tse handmade and assassin sentinel armor. I don't think it's fair that people who spend more time on the game have more stuff than people that only hop on for 20 mins a week.
---
No thanks, I’ve seen the death claw maze videos.
---
Yeah I don’t know why mine does it but it’s like once an hour. Just before I had two crashes in the space of about five minutes
---
i sell all those too as a high level player doing nukes and queens every day. there's just no way it doesn't keep piling up, and if you can sell it to another player, it means you have more stuff to sell per day to the NPC vendors. eventually someone runs by and buys all your screws, and sure it'll take a week or two of normal play before you'll have a superfluous amount of screws, but sooner or later, you'll have too much of the stuff.
---
i also bulk all of my good junk and sell them for 1 cap more than i would get by selling it to the vendor (without hard bargaining), which seems to be a price that many people are willing to pay. the bad junk i just bulk and sell to the vendor. no one really wants rubber, leather, cloth, or whatever, but acid, aluminium, screws, etc.
---
Acid: I do the following route to get acid from creatures:
---
\- Mountainside Bed &amp; Breakfast: 2 Yao Guai
---
\- Middle Mountain cabins: 0-3 Yao Guai
---
\- Silo Alpha: 1 Yao Guai
---
\- Seneca Rocks Visitor Center: 0-3 Yao Guai
---
\- Monongah Overlook: 1 Yao Guai
---
\- Dolly Sods Wilderness: 1 Yao Guia
---
\- Toxic Larry's Meat &amp; Go: 3 Snallygasters
---
Also I pick up every Abraxo boxes and Blue/Red/Green plastic bottles.
---
when i first login the server i drop into on ps4 seems almost dead, only a couple of player vendors, events seem to spawn a lot less and nothing much seems to be happening (most of the players on the server are low level) but then i server hop and i end up in a much more active world (most of the players are high level)
---
You calling me a cunt isn't going to hurt my feelings or make me change my mind about you being a little bitch because muh gamez crashes
---
600 karma- do you even reddit kid
---
In fact you are right somewhat. And your Screens are sadly familar to me.
---
But have to search for a solution "out of the game" is not as it should be intended to play a game properly imo.
---
A little late to this, but is this plan still around? Or was it taken out due to the bugs? I’ve been to every vendor in 2 servers and couldn’t find one lol
---
Lol I bet your internet points make your hollow life just a little more meaningful bud ;)
---
i gather all kinds of pristine pre-war food, free of rads, and sell in my vendor as a complimentary snack for 1 cap each (except for the salisbury steak which is 2 caps). you could get the caps back by selling it to a NPC vendor. fancy lads snack, salisbury steak, sugar bombs, preserved instamash, you name it and i got it. also sell nuka quantum for 5 cap a pop. wish there was pre-war coffee free of rads as well, but alas i make do with honest rad-tainted coffee - cheap too, 1 cap each!
---
funny thing is few people will buy any of it, and nearly always when they do they'll buy all of it.
---
highly debated actually
---
i myself have for pieces and im certain it stacks others swear it doesnt just try it for yourself and see if it fits you thats probably the safest option here
---
I guess because it's a different developer, still though there's a lot of things I think they should have carried over like the freedom in armor customisation and DLC styles. They are quite different games though plus I'm not a games dev so I'm not sure how well they'd meld.
---
Fallout 4 had a perk that did it
---
Ten
---
 
---
Thousand 
---
Karma. 
---
That lets me shit on little fuckstains like you ALL fucking DAY
---
5 times today I should have gotten legendary loot fix the fucker and while you're at it fix the immortal enemy glitch
---
If this is a reference to the upside down corner pieces, private message me - I have the solution to placing those
---
Play for 1 hour without encountering any glitches.
---
Server crashes are because people are duping their fucking entire bank again. Crying about it here isn't going to fix it over night. 
---
Suck it up and quit being a bitch. Just reload the game take 2 minutes.
---
I saw a dude with a tame megasloth. That was pretty impressive.
---
It stacks. CaptainNoob did a video on it. He sneaks right past a Yao Guai countless times in front of it, and around.
---
It undeniably stacks,
---
So basically you just want everyone to just stand there in plain sight and let you kill them ?
---
There is also a stealth blade, but these appear to be different base weapons, not modified versions. Which if accurate is a real shame.
---
I've seen video evidence that it does stack
---
Im used to it on all games because my internet cuts out every 20 mins
---
would be a shame i have a mutants swing speed ciltist blade and hoped to upgrade it thanks for the information
---
Melee doesn't need to be better. It already has the highest damage potential in game
---
i also seatch for these but when you say you first have to learn the sturdy plans question is
---
where can i find those?
---
Lesson learned...
---
Could you be more specific, please? Or send a pic or something. I've been wondering for a while looking for a bench but I had no clue. Then, for the abandoned camp, I keep searching for it but I always end up in the Blackwater Mine.
---
Also, do you still have the hood? I would buy it.
---
I have a quad explosive one and there was a bug where all my 245 harpoons went into the gun and 
---
It just didn't break u till they were all shot
---
I think i need to have this printed in a large format  
---
you know like the ones they used to give with the games...
---
[PC] I just got a new one, everything is black and no sound. Tried fast travelling and relogging but nope. I still see other players tags moving around and the  HUD and map screen, but in world nothing. Guess that's all for today.
---
TSE or AAE for everyone!  then they nerf. Drops missed be sparse so we all keep playing
---
Right in front of top of the world's trains station. Got a junk extractor there. Gets alot of foot traffic. Probably is why its always taken.
---
More than one.
---
Have a BE one and I can't use it because it breaks in less than 15 shots if someone shoot me...
---
They had it on fo4. Probably took it out for balancing reasons. Bloodied melee builds are already the most powerful characters.
---
Wow. Pissy much? I was agreeing with you. Never mind.
---
Let me know if you want to sell it!
---
I found 1 in thunder mountain among the lockers and what not.
---
try the vendors, check what metal armor plans they have for sale light, normal, sturdy or heavy you need to learn the lower ones first, player vendors sell all the different types and usually much cheaper than the robot vendors
---
Ranger District office in Cranberry Bog
---
i so have all the light versions and was searching evry vendor at least twice also i do always check out player vendors guess i have bad luck though
---
thanks anyways ill keep trying 👍🏼
---
neat, I imagine other places have independent oddities as well.
---
These are vertibots. Not vertibirds. Vertibots took the seats out in order to put in the self driving mechanism. Probably no chance of being able to use them...
---
Melee is pretty op already. If you run a bloody stealth build the damage gets silly.
---
On a crate in that little shop area across from the workshop with the power armor station outside of Blackwater Mine.
---
99% of players are really nice and friendly. Last night I had a player for the first time come up to me and hit me in the face. He kept doing this but as I’ve got pacifist on I knew as long as I didn’t hit him back then he couldn’t do anything. He was a level 50 and I’m 120 and got pissed because I didn’t want to trade. I’m not very trusting and never trade as always think they just want to see what stuff I’ve got. But last week I had to start a new character as I couldn’t log in. There was a lot of helpful players but 50% of players just wanted to give me a hard time.  Following me and keep shooting at me. Wasn’t high level players but players that were in their 40-50s.
---
Help me get a green hood, please
---
I'm level 99, suited out, and I still just scav. It's way more fun for me.
---
Couldn’t agree more especially with regards to junk haulers (I stopped doing encrypted because of that and the lack of co-op) also the 1 kill wonders seems to be happening more often but the 3* (1*) drop happens every time infact I can’t remember the last time I actually dropped 3* goody 🤔
---
My biggest gripe is when you're looking at the wares and it shows 15 weapons, 20 armor, and nothing else you immediately go "legendaries on a mule!" Then you show up and its a machete, a half broken level 35 .50, and other such lack luster loot, check armor, all cosmetics that're easy to find for ridiculous prices. I'm not paying 500 caps for an unmodified set of green fatigues, I'm not paying 300 for a vtu letterman jacket, and I'm not dropping 1000 caps on the black cowboy hat. 
---
Seriously I saw that last one 3 nights ago.
---
It might be because of your mutations what you should do is just take some meds to make your stats higher than it should complete this for you as it helped my friend with his strength
---
keep trying and just exploring the map you will find plenty of plans just playing the game, metal armor plans are most common in the northern half of the savage divide and the toxic valley
---
maybe treasue maps are a good starting point?
---
thank you very much!
---
This why mine is just a shed full of crafting tables
---
&gt; Some of the defense targets are very weak, but even tier 1 wolf can be kept alive. All you need is a level 50+ character with decent gear perked for tanking and damage. The wave enemies are nothing special and can be killed even with non legendary weapons.
---
My lvl 35 toon can handle the dungeon. It's not particularly taxing, plus my 35 is pretty twinked with fully modded lvl 35 PA and nice bloodied weapons. I wouldn't try it before 35 though and the only reason it's really doable on 35 is that it's only 1 step below max level items if they're lvl 45 items. My toon, in particular has a bloodied lever action rifle and it 1 shots most normal mobs and 2 shots the rest.
---
I really should have specified how it was over complicated in my post, I've posted more often here in this very thread that the event itself sort of boring and simple. The complexity doesn't come from the event objectives themselves but the nature of how it forces players to interact with each other and splits up passing the event with the most sought after reward. This event design is undeniably a mess and if you try to argue that then I can, in good conscience, dismiss what you have to say.
---
Trust me bro....
---
Yeah well at least you know you aren’t the only one lol it definitely sucked but it pushed me to move somewhere else where I’m really happy at now
---
Take out those annoying bugs &amp; small enemies. Someone needs to do that 👍👍
---
SUPER tiny
---
I don't have any mutation. I will try by using some chems.
---
it is less active, a lot of my friends left the game for good
---
I suppose you're right! I've not come across any toxic players, they've either been kind or just neutral towards me!
---
Even though it said 5 strength it didn't work till his was 7
---
To be fair, ive been renting from redbox with free rental codes lol. So I'm at level 45 with not a single dollar towards the game. However, I plan on buying it on pc very soon
---
These two certainly made my night!
---
I love it myself. I have a sad Suppressors explosive one that simply had to shelf due to durability and clip size. Such a fun gun though.
---
treasure maps are a good idea they usally give an armor plans and they can be bought for about 50 caps from players
---
Thunder Mountain in the control room. It's a static spawn so you can server hop if it's not there.
---
I said that after the last patch something was up with the spawn points the one in flatwoods right by my base had a mothman in a scorchbeast believe it or not.
---
This will always get an upvote from me! Vault dwellers for bigger jars!
---
It's part of a Possum Challenge
---
Ive had this same question myself and i cant find any good answers. Bethesda needs to add floating damage numbers or a firing range where we could test our weapons damage outputs.
---
Yeah I wouldn’t care about them if I didn’t lose progress buying lost a lot of progress because of them and it just makes me not want to play because I don’t want to keep repeating activities lol
---
i do actually have quite a few on my character guess im up for a treasure hunt next time 
---
are you able to craft full sets of sturdy or heavy metal armor btw? im running a shop selling sets of armors together with weapons and apparel to low level characters and want to expand my offers if you could craft a full set of sturdy metal armor lvl 20 or such id see how much i can pay for that
---
What if it were done “locally”? I know it’s immersion breaking, but say if you travelled to my house you saw your own screenshots, whereas when I travel I also see my ones at your place and my own.
---
I don’t know the first thing about programming, servers or anything the like so this could be a stupid question, just curious is all.
---
My personal thanks to you, as hazmat suit user - keep up good work!
---
I just watched that dude's review yesterday actually. He does a damn good job of explaining what the game does right and wrong. The core of his review still stands true 3 months since it's release.
---
Some of the problems still persist (limited carry weight, perk card swapping, server lag issues) and glitches still happen sometimes but most of the worst visual and game-breaking ones have been resolved. 
---
I'd still say to buy it at $40 or less though.
---
Oh yeah! Now i remember it!
---
Also the scene one in flatwoods also does objectives. I find little quests I loot of bodies there all the time. Including today
---
I’m guessing the weight is 20-25 eh... if so than the extra 1 strength will offset some of the weight so it won’t be too bad.  I’d change it out, and keep all rise as a back up weapon
---
To be fair, I didn't glibly dismiss the mechanics, that's quite literally all they are.
---
What platform and what plans???
---
Definitely keep. Much better than all rise
---
This is a much better weapon for pve. The instigating will double your damage along with your 40% power attack buff. You’ll be able to one shot more enemies. The  + strength will also buff its damage.
---
I’ve got a similar Fire Axe, except the +1 STR instead is 30% more damage to ghouls. 
---
I’m not specced for melee and it’s a beast. 
---
I would use it over your All Rise.
---
We now have display name YES! :)
---
I've had maybe 2 server crashes in the last 3 months. Play almost every day. I'd check your connection, router, cables and drivers.
---
Just kids wanting to one shot the Whole group at once now lmao
---
Be the change you want to see in the world.
---
Also, I would imagine XBOX player base to be younger and/or more idiotic than PC player base, but that's just my grumpy old man speaking.
---
My super sledge with the same effects rips anything below SBs. So if its a super sledge hell yeah, but if not still try it out.
---
Gmod is a game aswell, so why cant they add it to fo76?
---
A woman can bare a child and thats a human aswell, so why can men bare childs?
---
Not every game/game engine is built the same way to support the same stuff
---
Exactly. Conversation over lol
---
This challenge is a bit weird. I play the spanish version, and in that version it says that you need to have at least 8 Strength/Agility or more to complete this challenge.
---
Now, I changed the language to english and it says that you only need 5.
---
Vats is meta and is a lot easier to work. Commando vats build rules. Only reason to use rifle is if you don’t want to consume a lot of ammo
---
I used to get disconnected 4x back to back within a 8 hour gaming session and this was two weeks after the game officially launched.  Now I get a server disconnect maybe once an 8hr gaming session.
---
I have high speed boosted internet with download speeds of 150mb/s and many gamers in the house.  And the only time I’ve noticed my server disconnect and then not register items made, learned, or bought.  Is when my internet would hiccup.  
---
And I’ve noticed my friend gets disconnected allll the time and he has internet that downloads at 4mb/s 
---
So I’m wondering if it’s an internet issue?  I have no way to test this theory though other than my own first hand experience :/ BETHESDA DID RELEASE SOME TIPS IF YOUR GAME KEEPS CRASHING [Xbox one](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44380/~/what-do-i-do-if-fallout-76-is-crashing-on-xbox-one%3F) [PS4](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/42916/~/what-do-i-do-if-fallout-76-is-crashing-on-ps4%3F) PC your on your own ;-; idk how to help you guys. I HOPE THIS HELPS SOME OF YOU BECAUSE THIS GAME IS SO MUCH FUN 😍
---
Do you have the PA yet? I'm on PC and could help you get the plans and resources if you want to?
---
Obviously a sniper will hit harder but the dps for a commando build shits on semiautos
---
It's my frogs kink
---
Same as the deathclaw gauntlet, without the perk it lasts one and a half west tek runs which is only like 40 some enemies.
---
I feel you, my first ever scorchbeast queen fight took quite a long time and almost all my ammo. The moment it died, my game crashed and I never got to loot it nor get the trophy. That was like 4-5 months ago and I haven’t played since lol
---
slap on a piece or two of unyielding armor and be low health, youll have what you need.
---
Are the tadpole challenges character specific or account bound? If so just level a new char time level five and that would complete it right?
---
Granted this is only of the Badges are account based not char. 
---
My logic  behind it being I had to start a new character to complete some achievements but not sure if I want to level 100+ chars to get Fallout Forever.
---
Yeah definitely! One of the guys from the comments here just helped me get the plans and his power armour bugged out so all I could see was his character in power armour legs. Just a regular dude running around in huge pants was the funniest thing I’ve seen so far
---
It’s all good now! One of the guys from the comments here gave me a hand (ie, walked my noob ass through the whole thing) thanks though! This community is so great
---
yeah i can do that i'm on ps4 what about you
---
Single player server? I haven’t heard about that but that would be great....🤔👍🏻
---
The servers can happily handle this, all they’d have to do is make functionality that enables you to create a custom camp decoration. Then use the pictures inside your photo mode folder as variants of it. So different frames with the same pictures.
---
I feel you don’t know much technically on this judging by that comment
---
Yeah I actually like the game just wish I didn’t have to keep redoing things lol. That being said I am in Australia and Australia’s internet is trash. But it is the only game that does it. I’ll check out the link and see if it helps! Cheers brother
---
After tons of patches, this bug is still there.
---
me too thats perfect feel free to check out my account so you can see what im talking about ill add you next time im online whats your psn? also id credit you for the help if you want to
---
And then appalachia would be filled with porn and viruses.
---
Yea this would be client side only. I don’t think pip-boy sounds are global atm. It would be the same as replacing a mod sound file now.
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
You're killin' me Smalls!!
---
I still havent played it, it either crashes after im in the elevator or the elevator buttons dont load... long story short i gave up
---
The developers have been having a problem with wording things wrong and the challenges. I know there's a challenge where it says shoot a Yahweh with the syringer but it has to be the endangerall or it won't work.   Aim for 8 hope it works
---
no you can not miss a shot or switch weapons or it resets it
---
PSN - blaine_anderson, my character is a crafter who has had nothing to craft
---
perfect ill give your crafter something to do! :D
---
Fissure site prime ?
---
It's a Prime location for nuking that spawns Scorchbeast Queen (end-game boss). Other than some unique recipes and 3-star legendaries it's nothing special. You do get a ton of EXP there though.
---
Ah ok thanks
---
great just send me friend request, i will be online later
---
Also conduits, there is a wall pass conduit
---
Straight forward - good post. Didn't expect from title so 9/10.
---
The only events which i enjoyed with the more folks the better were/are fasnacht and also campfire tales.
---
Imposter, free Range and also Arktos are a bit a pain because as soon as a legendary spawns mostly all drive crazy and dont care about any objective to get the Event done.
---
What is it
---
That is another annoyance, unless there is a rad pond near I just avoid them, again like someone else suggested may be a camp build that predates the vender patch and they have never played as min and use the same blueprint. Why we get so many camps with structures floating off cliffs, they were build on flat ground originally.
---
My camps are always made of several small utility buildings, small and compact.
---
Trap camps have always been a thing, dont want a risk of dying? Dont tp to anyones camp.
---
Adventure mode is not hello kitty adventure mode
---
Grognak approves.
---
That's a shame, maybe BSG lost/fired their Italian mod/s :(
---
I suggested this as a feature for 2-handed weapon to make it better at waweclearing but worse as solo target dps, and buff 1-handed to make it best for 1 target
---
it because everyone is going for these events its rare to find them
---
Thanks all,
---
I just bought from Pleasant Valley vendor bot MIRV mod plan for fatman for 438 caps with hard bargain + grape mentats
---
perfect im gonna be online for one or two hours too
---
ok see you online
---
if you are on ps4 feel free to check out my account to get a glimpse of what i am doing you seem like the perfect candidate to visit my camp sometime if you want to you can message me give me some information of what kind of build your trying to achieve and i will do my best to help you out!
---
Also depends one what legendary weapon effects you have. Instigator = Rifleman. TS/Furious = Commando. AA/Bloodied = Either.
---
Someone want to give me a hand getting a deathclaw or mega sloth to spawn? Been at it for hours and no luck other then a radrat pup and a ragstag doe
---
I don't know mate, got a QE flechette harpoon and it lasts quite a long time, given its damage output and ability to one/two-shot basicaly everything save Mire Queen and SBs... It's much better in that regard than, let's say, explo lasers.
---
How did you roll Ghoul Slayer WITH Instigator?!
---
So broken. So is the collection one. I can't get it to check off nuka cola dark...
---
Tried crafting it, dropping it, having a friend trade  or put in in a container.
---
til then bro
---
I don't understand, same for the damage, but the durability for mine is awful
---
Yeah, I don't get their logic in taking stuff like that away.I swear half the difficulty of the building in this game is fighting the bugs in the building mechanics and when we find ways around them, Bethesda's like "NO! No circumventing our mistakes!" "IT JUST WORKS!!!"
---
what system?
---
The bugs mate, there's a lot of them
---
these can pop up randomly all over the map once they pop up and you join them they usually give you like four or five locations to check out and find the horde
---
I would sell my best with my best if my best had more stash space.
---
Seriously, i also play the game and putting 20 weapons to my stash and suddenly i have 0 space for junk
---
Won't count legendary yao guai for me as well. I've killed 2 so far.
---
As for the location ones they were bugged from back in the beta and if you discovered them before they were fixed it won't count them.
---
You have to discover them on a new character
---
I’m not too sure actually. It’s possible I could be mistaken.
---
It adds 5% damage to each consecutive hit on the target. Only problem is - the way full auto damage is calculated/displayed is buggy and the enemy tend to "heal" portion of the damage while still being tagged.
---
If that ever gets fixed, Furious will shine as it should do. I'm still waiting for a good Furious Gatling Plasma to roll at Legendary Vendor I could use.
---
R/iamverysmart
---
being a low-leveled semi-melee character, i have a feeling i would like this a lot, even if it was a perk card.
---
I got a badge from stings and things just the other day. But it was the first and only time after doing it countless times. They seem to be pretty rare.
---
I had a diseased non legendary whitesprings ghoul drop 2 one star legendaries yesterday
---
Had a bounty for the same reason, and a lvl 16 walked up to my lvl 3xx butt and, in extremely broken enggrish, explained to me that he had to kill me for the bounty, as he needed the caps. He was deeply sorry.
---
While I could probably have snuffed him out with a heavy breath, I told him to let me stash my junk and have at it.
---
After a minute or so of fighting my med dispenser in the power armor, I had to take it off so he could kill me :D
---
Every now and again I get bored and decide to launch a nuke I pick a random spot. Sometimes I even let my kid point to a spot on the map. Then I just go explore the nuked area.
---
Too right nobody wants those pixels pretending to be a  frog to die....
---
Man, that sucks. Never have had an experience of this type, although sometimes I see the speaker icon pop up with a small “x” next to it.
---
Because the DCG isn't overpowered at all.
---
Did you keep all animals alive?
---
i do have a one star furious gatling plasma that works fine but its hard to not miss a lot of shots with it
---
i thought the flamer version would be good with it but as it turns out that was trash
---
You deserve it for being the kind of person to thank for gold
---
I learned this the hard way. Found a player selling mags... bought 20 of them at 20caps a pop... read them all and nothing.
---
Which sucks because I wanted the trophy and to do the collection challenges, at first its going to be easy but when you get down to just a few missing grinding to find 1 specific one is going to be a pain.
---
You need the Home Defense perk for more advanced Tourette’s.
---
How did you get the collect nuka drinks done?
---
My nuka cola dark won't pop tried making them, having others drop it and so on.
---
If you're on Xbox I'll pay 3k for it.
---
What do you want from the nuke? If you want flora ignore ash heap. Go for somewhere east maybe, cranberry bog, Harper's ferry. Go nuts it's a big map.
---
It still has some really anything bugs
---
Does the Dodgey perk not work?
---
Because they tried something different then thier norm.  And there are some issues....  But I enjoy the game alot.
---
No need to name and shame
---
Well, I'm not sure either, running HW PA build and using Gunsmith 3... Maybe it's only my subjective perception, as I tend to change weapons on fave wheel quite often (have 5 faved...), but I'm positively using that harpoon around 50% of time and it doesn't degrade significantly faster than any other guns - and they're all explo, TSE and such.  
---
Now if you're using only harpoon, then it might seem like it degrades fast, but what doesn't then..?
---
Where you originally put your camp down is where they travel to, have a friend test this before you build the rest. It works, it helps, and increases your buyers
---
Well, it’s a mix honestly of wanting something new to kill but also wanting some fluorescent violet flux I think it is
---
i dont know if thats the problem but as far as i know your luck stat does influence the durability of the weapons you find
---
so two versions of basically the exact same gun can vary in durability maybe thats the problem i guess you just happened to find one with low durability in the first place they can make quite a difference i have a vampire plasma flamer that dropped on me with a really low durability bar unfortunately
---
I have like 1600. I've mostly spent atoms on paints for armor and my Pip-boy.
---
It's actually broken
---
It degrades fast not by using it, but by using it and being hit, each hit on me cost 20% of its life
---
There’s a good low level one top left of map, by the fairground, called ‘leader of the pack’.
---
North East and east map probably your best bet then. Hitting fissure site prime will bring up best results for a range of enemies.
---
Xbox
---
It's durability bar is large and I have a unyielding build with high luck so I don't think it is the problem
---
what is an Ansel ?
---
Isn’t that where the queen scorchbeast will spawn?
---
Burrows
---
Never thought of it
---
The dead tourist, which gives you the camera.
---
Yeah prime fissure site spawns SBQ, so depending on the challenge you want .......
---
okey just wanted to say this as i seen a lot of people who didnt know about that
---
one other thing to try would be to swap out gunsmith and swap it back in sometimes the perkcards expecially for heavy weapons seem to "forget" that they are equipped
---
Apparently a lot of the ghouls become glowing ones plus multiple legendaries
---
I’ll just server hop and find some high levels lol
---
I can't use gunsmith cause of exploding perk using instead+nerd rage, but even without gunsmith this poor durability is not normal
---
I have tons of guns and even the dragon doesn't break as easy as this one
---
The thing is...it’s not translated bad. I think IDs got mixed up when they introduced patch 9.0/9.5. They were that big because they had Nuclear Winter files in them and now that IDs are mixed up, some show spoilers and new content.
---
okey well gunsmith tends to help a lot but now im al out of ideas sorry man :D
---
Same in the german localization.... :(
---
I personally like to upgrade under armour and drop it off with a level 2 fresh out of the vault.
---
Lucky hole mine is amazing, don't forget to use excavator armour for that double pick up. The nodes can be hard to see until you get the hang of where they are. Also the secret path has some in it to. Also add in super duper perk when smelting it into lead scrap.
---
Also the mind has a chem bench in it. My last run I got 328 ore... 2 ore makes 5 lead and a 30% chance for double yield.
---
Using a silence AA ffr handmade as a stealth commando build only takes 2-3 bullets for a lvl 68 mutie or Ghoul especially when you get the sneak multipliers. I've contemplated going rifleman myself but sometumes you get swarmed and need the firepower if a full auto
---
Can confirm. I helped raid it after a nuke dropped and had to deal with heaps of both.
---
Lol thank you for your comments, I just want Beth to do their job and repair what it is obviously broken
---
I'm on PC, add me and I'll come clear it with you :)
---
Heres a few tips from someone that solos it on a frequent basis:
---
1.Do the Venison, Lv1 gives a yao guai, it can tank most of the boss with no issues. This is the easiest part to solo, imo. Mainly due to the venison being easy and frequent respawns and you can collect enough to get said bear to hang out with. Issues can arise if theres multiple people that comes to the venison, but i've had moderate success by asking them to do the sludge part while i cap out the meat one. If not just run and gun/punch and it should be easy to get 30+ for Lv1 even within the allocated time.
---
2. Sludge, this one is easier to get to Lv2 if you are solo, but its risky. the Lv1 is pretty useless and tends to die somewhat quick compared to the venison one.
---
3. Radkelp - Avoid at all costs, i havent been able to get this one to Lv1 solo at all, the respawns are too slow.
---
The boss:
---
Reenact the final fight between Anakin and Obi-wan and you'll be fine. As long as you maintain the high ground it's a walk in the park. Might take some time and a few grenades for the adds, but its very possible to do solo.
---
You can also use formulas for different beneficial things like restoring friendly NPC HP and such. but i rarely have any need to do so.
---
if you are on pc i have soooo many .44 ammo to give you, i'll also help you with your armor and upgrade your weapons. butt i'm not going to be on for a few hours its laundry day. hit me up in a few hours mattola69
---
I’m checking that shit out, is the burrows the one underground?
---
i guess they see it as kind of a balancing because explosives with multiple projectiles are op and so they want them to have a major drawback
---
Found mine in thunder mountain yesterday!
---
It would also be nice if the durability of blackpowder weapons was buffed.
---
But here's the big question.  Will this harpoon gun pin a limb to a wall?
---
/r/iammeanfornoreason
---
if they dont feel like working too much on a cross-server system they could basically copy-and-paste the radio queueing system that already exists for hunter/hunted
---
ill give you 5k if you wanting to sell if not i understand or make me an offer
---
Same with French and German
---
It would be just stupid so, cause it would be more viable to nerf it but not having to repair it every 5 min
---
Honestly I don’t even know what they go for
---
Also don't forget that in Gmod and TF2 the sprays used are only 300 pixels by 300 so they aren't too big, where as screenshots are generally thousands of pixels large making them bigger
---
Yes. they do. i killed 40+ before a datamining mate confirmed they didnt actually drop from deathclaws.
---
This would not work, because a: it would be really unfair to give a small set of players unique content b: it would still have to be in the files so dataminers would dig everything
---
He was a douche.  But your reaction was hilarious!!
---
Oh!!!!! there are cameras all over the place check the miscellaneous tab in your PB i found like 20 in there yesterday
---
ok np but if you wanna make a quick 5k let me know
---
It really should be black and orange like they are. It was in FO4
---
Find a way to connect it to the other parts of your camp, I had that same problem like 5 times now, just findnsomeeay to put it back to another part of your camp but if it's that bug a problem for you I would move the camp slightly so everything disappears and start over, I had to do the same thing a couple times. Feels bad man
---
I’ll keep you in mind then
---
ty
---
Why tweaked?
---
Hmm that’s weird indeed. 
---
Have you tried changing appearances when out the vault? Maybe that could neutralize it. 
---
Seems like your stuck in character creation
---
I also have 10k karma. Your point? They are internet points, they mean nothing. In terms of these meaningless internet points, you and I are equals, one small difference, I'm *not* a cunt.
---
well balancing seems to not be bethesdas strength we know that 😅
---
I must agree with that...
---
If damage gets split between enemies, then it would make sense. If people want to deal 100% damage to 5+ targets with one hit, then it's a bad idea for a world, where melee weapons already dominate.
---
Why?
---
I see people with guns in every class one shotting multiple enemies with their exploading bullets, or Tesla rifles..
---
Drop off the ammo you don't want in a container at a Railroad Station for other players.
---
Call me a cunt all you want m8 it won't change it. 
---
We've never met, your opinion means nothing to me.
---
Does it have anything useful beside the aesthetics change?
---
To those who complain about "trap rooms" that's already possible.. Guests spawn exactly where you first set down camp..
---
Or sell it in your shop....
---
*whilst +1
---
Good thing you did that humbly, without seeking attention for your deeds by bragging about your generosity on the web!! Oh.. wait.. dang it.
---
The saddest thing is all these and the ones from the comments aren't even that far off.
---
Again you seem to be under the impression that these points actually have meaning in the real world. They don't. You do understand that, right?
---
Oh and also, you are right, we have never met, and I think it is quite likely you have never met the Op either. So why exactly *do* you think your opinion on this post matters?
---
I cripple ghouls for sure than just run off to cripple some more. Someone else will clean up the mess. 
---
This also makes the boss fight of Project Paradise laughably simple too. Even level 100 mobs mean nothing when they can't walk after you.
---
"I'll try spinning! That's a good trick!"
---
Why was this downvoted?
---
Furious works the following (im not sure if its 8 or 9% per hit, but):
---
Furious applies a buff on the mob, as long as you hit it within 10 seconds of doing so, itll refresh and go up to a total of 50% increased damage this effect stays on the target until the following conditions are met:
---
You hit another mob or object that drains durability, Explosive splash damage resets it. So does hitting the ground with an explosive round
---
You do not hit the mob for 10 seconds.
---
Missing does not reset the effect, assuming you do not hit something that drains durability.
---
Hope that clears it up. Had a few dataminers clear it out on discord earlier this week after a hefty "is furious bad?" debate.
---
The difference between how players great each other is night and day in concern of Xbox/PS4 and PC.
---
From the outset on playing on Xbox, I was just getting melted by other players or getting my bases destroyed or being trolled.
---
On PC however as soon as I got out of Vault76 and complete the first quest I was covered in bags of plans etc, with Randi's requesting to team up and help make a nice base camp. They was polite and kind wanting nothing back in return.
---
Yes some players will still melt you if they are hunters however they don't take your junk and guard it from other players till you return to collect it.
---
On Xbox most camps I saw had turrents everywhere on PC there isn't many turreted bases.
---
 Still have the 1HK killers where you can't tag them but a simple angry emote changes that some time or a help me emote does the same.
---
Just FYI, you need an empty PA frame in your inventory to be able to build your Excavator PA. There is a PA station right in the building’s basement. 
---
After you done, don’t forget to register your new set at the same basement (look for the quest marker) to finish the quest.
---
regardless. even if that works everytime, having to do that is sone bs. this wasnt a free game. It's not a beta. it's been like 7 months since launch? 4 years since fo4? get it together.
---
Sounds more like the award goes to Todd for finally being released of the eternal contract written with letters glitching through it sideways.
---
I’m just gonna leave my note here saying I’m 110% PVE :D
---
Probably puts them on his resume
---
👆🏻so true so very true
---
There's that one farm thats in the forest that has a high amount of crops growing. I wonder if it's in the no nuke zone though. Not necessarily good for enemies, but prob a good way to farm flux. It's just wild speculation
---
Thanks for the reply! So bloodied is essentially more powerful in a melee build? Through my early levels I specced for a melee build so already have most of the necessary perk cards.
---
I'm also specced for a rifleman build too and have a bloodied lever action which seems pretty decent. Same question again (sorry) would unyielding armour benefit this build more than my PA?
---
Same, I'm level 120 and I've killed one other player and that's because he asked me to.
---
Because crying about things on the internet is the way things get fixed. Sure. I forgot? 
---
Why not spend you're time googling some key points and finding a solution to the problem? Or better yet a cause of the problem? 
---
Go to your world's whitespring restaurant and report everyone duping their items. Maybe then we might see some kind of sever stability. 
---
Everyone knows why it's happening, spamming up the reddit feed with your bitching won't fix it
---
When you find yourself in need of quick caps then rubber, glass, and plastic for crafting marine tactical helmets is a cheap and quick grind
---
Stagger over anything else this game has unless bad build
---
You may have to take the  cap hit and “re-place” you C.A.M.P and start from scratch.
---
So because you don’t do something no one else must do it. There’s a huge pvp crowd in fallout 76. You just don’t hear us because we either get downvoted on here or we don’t whinge like you food build babies.
---
I believe this is actually possible if 2 enemies are stood in close proximity.
---
I don't have any photographic proof or evidence but I did 1 hit 2 charred feral ghouls at the area of white springs where all the work benches are and they both went down in the same hit.
---
Not sure if it was a glitch or intentional but it definitely happened.
---
Doesn't matter what the floor is. 
---
What really irks me is when you spawn inside their camp and all their doors are locked... if you wanna lock your camp, fair enough. But at least leave a workbench outside near a window so we can get out.
---
No explosive damage boosts for builds where they shine the most as big guns desperately need all the damage boost they can get, no stagger, no fireproof, kinda far from ultimate
---
Just realized I've been role playing Reinhardt this whole time!
---
I tried doing this but some dillweed decided to take everything I had sitting out for everyone to use. I had them in a chest with a sign beside it that said one drink per guest and please put the outfits back when you are done taking your pictures.... So no I don't think I'll do this again...
---
It’s very common if you die to the legendary before finally killing it. Some reports claim they’ve gotten 5 legendary items by dying on purpose.
---
Maybe your 10,000 karma points will?
---
Haha I only killed this one guy once that had a bounty, for the achievement. 
---
I felt so bad afterwards I dropped LOADS of stuff for him XD
---
Because you get you upload anything as a spray. But selecting only photos taken in games and say only allowing 5 to be in your gallery that area displayed in camp would limit that. And since they are going to be in frames in the wall it's not like you'll need the high resolution they are saved in.
---
Ehhh, I’ve seen people really good at playing the game mostly crouched. And camps don’t take damage unless you’re in direct combat with the owner (or their team) 
---
Super lame I know
---
3 star wood armor....I have some bad news for you friend.
---
Best description of this game I ever heard 😂
---
I love it
---
Yep! You get there by going into the sewers right next to Harper's Ferry.
---
ayyy ur so funny did u eat a clow or something
---
2 out of 3.
---
There’s a difference between hate and someone giving their ideas to make the game better. What’s wrong with you?
---
Let us add our own tracks
---
Try and hit lots of player vendors. Every now and then I snag tons of 100/100 cores for dirt cheap.
---
But I want to be in a vertibot while in power armor😂
---
Just invite some scorched into your camp..blow the brains out onto a white wall ...instant art that Jackson Pollock would be proud of .
---
Really? Millions of players on TF2. How many per match I don't remember. And why in the world would you need high resolution photos for the frames? It's going inside a small area certainly 800*600 is plenty. That's maybe 2mb. Oh the horror of downloading 2mb. It might take .2 seconds. Turn off the option to see them if it's that big of a deal.
---
They are in the apparel scection?
---
Player Vendors and Poseidon Power Plant’s workshop.
---
Where is that?
---
What do you mean? I still one shot those fat glowing bastards with a combat shotgun. I wouldn't call that weak for close range, though i gotta admit the range on em suck! Though im not a shotgun build so others may differ.
---
With regards to the event he just want is Pip-Boy and left it and then he was able to attack you
---
you can't trade those or drop them or sell them ...even the broken ones
---
I havent played survival mode once and never killed another player (killing my friend doesnt count cause we wanted to see how pvp worked) and ive been playing since launch :P Though im only level 92 on main character and 43 on my second one. I really hope they focus more on pve and story in the future
---
If you drop them they get destroyed and you can't sell or trade them either.
---
They are literally everywhere. Look for a broken deluxe prosnap camera. You can find them at vendors, it loot boxes, etc.
---
Maybe they'd listen to me since I'm not a fucking peon.
---
Oh. That sucks.
---
That's ridiculous about camps. These guys weren't crouched though. They were running, jumping, standing up.
---
Due south from Vault 76, just west of Charleston.
---
You CAN drop them if you spam items to be dropped, then just pick up the items you want to keep leaving the camera in the bag.
---
That would be amazing, also seeing a thrown together wastelandish train would be a great feeling
---
I’m getting really mugged off then
---
Just now got disconnected while transferring legendaries from my mule to my main. At least 8 3* legendaries now gone because i was still on the pipboy menu dropping stuff for my alt accounts mule to pick up when i got the "server not responding" then disconnected! Freaking sucks!
---
Ammo section
---
Sorry if this seems too obvious but are you checking for additional vending machines?   I haven't encountered this before on pc
---
Vendors only sell them after you have already found one.
---
take over an energy plant as a workshop, you get 12 an hour if i am not mistaken and they are free
---
Years to program an already existing code they have?
---
Oh! That sucks.
---
For what it's worth, I try to be fairly friendly player, or at least neutral.  It just took me a while to understand the tagging mechanic, so I probably did this same thing for a while.
---
This sounds like just another stupid event/quest that I'm not going to bother with. There's getting to be quite a lot of them.
---
Or the war drum seems fitting for that 😀
---
look in your misalliances tap on your PB you may already have some
---
I’m on PC or I’d help you.
---
But if you're attacking a group I think some kinda AOE should happen. I have enough mutations so if I get smacked  they get electrocuted/nuked/diseased. But for people who don't have that I think (on PS4) if you hit R1 it should swing and hit all surrounding targets
---
I'm guessing that Wastelanders will be the pve we have been wanting and this one will have some pve elements but will have the Pvp battle royale as the fulcrum.  As long as they understand what a battle royale entails,  and how crazy difficult it can be to actually be the last man standing and keep that in mind while assigning loot tables, I'll give it a go at least.
---
Oh my bad I thought you meant pilot them. Can’t ride in them because it still would need a large design pass and with multiplayer factoring in it isn’t as simple as just ripping the code from 4 but it could happen eventually
---
Just a cunt
---
I always have several in my vending machines. Different charges for different prices. GT Bigshotsasse
---
Just had a legendary bee swarm spawn in Whitespring. Never seen one before, so I took a picture and a screenshot and then killed it.
---
I tried to loot it and saw a legendary flamer in the loot window but the swarm "corpse" disappeared before I could loot it.
---
Are you sure 9%? That sounds incorrect
---
How far away from the encounter is your camp?  Mine is near one as well but I've never seen anything happen there.  I was honestly under the impression that encounters couldn't occur if there is a player camp anywhere nearby.
---
I've done some pvp, but I fully support different modes to be different servers... I won't step into survival 99% of the time. Mostly only PvP with ppl after talking about it first.
---
it wouldn't. Keep talking nonsense.
---
You know what would be nice? Bethesda taking the Fallout IP and using it to craft a robust, single player gaming experience. It would not only be nice, but it would earn at least $60 gross because I’d actually buy it!
---
Cereal inhaler:   *Google's peon* 
---
##at least my game works ya fkn hick
---
I'm stupid... I spent like 2 hours reasearching this last night. And I just couldn't understand why I couldn't make any changes to it... It's a Bowie knife DOH!
---
Meh, I thought the same thing,  least it could make others think to do something similar.
---
Well...that's sounds oddly like real challenges.
---
Lmao
---
I play both PvP and PvE. I like that they are focusing on both areas. I just wish they would fix the cheats, exploits and issues with PvP before creating more PvP areas.
---
100% agree
---
yep, this is how I know you're full of shit.
---
Every game can support everything, you simply have no idea how feature sets are designed nor what general implementations exist for various commonly used networking functionality in regards to online gaming.
---
Which, knowing where it stands, completely shits over your ignorant statement and makes you look moronic.
---
I think the reason why we can't sell ammo to vendors is due to glitches they've had in prior games (fallout4*wink*wink) with the selling of ammo to vendors ending in unlimited buying power/caps. I agree it'd be lovely tho.
---
You forgot to mention the Suppressor’s Tire Iron, Junkie’s Pipe Wrench and Mutant’s Board, and whatever the ridiculous “75% chance to reduce incoming damage from players by 8%” thing is. That is the most putrid thing ever.
---
I've been playing for about a month straight and I'd only seen two. Then, in the last several days, I've seen four more.
---
I think it would be a potentially much more fun fast travel system, where instead of being able to fast travel from wherever, you have to go to a vertibot/bird (cause I really don't know the difference) and then you can fly to another.
---
The only dangerous thing inside is the Bunny who will cuddle you to death 😋
---
This makes me more confused.
---
3* legendary sheepsquatch... Would love seeing this every time i do free range. In fact.. you got lucky😅 best thing i've seen there, were 2 1*star goats. But that's guaranteed if enough players participate, or at least are present.
---
I felt like such an ass whipping my camera out during the SBQ fight. Checked off a few boxes, though.
---
Maybe just in survival. The difference is the bot is unmanned and ai piloted
---
See it all the time in "One Violent Night" event. The entire wave of ghouls will drop dead to a single blast of chain-lightning.

Why are people still using this horrible piece of shit?

vault 51 is going to be PVP coming out during nuclear winter but if you forget there's two other high level of all trades coming out for PVE

I managed to get 12 agility by using diferent chems and food and I still don't have the badge :(
---
Forest Region, east of Nuka Cola plant. Needs 100 power to start producing fusion cores. Can either restart powerplant, or if you have a fusion generator and junk for a bunch of regular generators you can craft that and hook it up. There's also lead there to extract.
---
I would keep the brahmin indoors. There are some dicks who kill the cow
---
I had a love/hate relationship with it. I loved being able to kill all the ghouls surrounding me, but I hated hitting Dogmeat with it at the same time...
---
Whilst seeing all the other impossible challenges - THIS is by far the most impossible.
---
Ty
---
240, but I've probably gotten 5000-6000 total
---
My problem with group events, is they usually revolve around 1-shot enemies.  
---
There's no sensible reason my character would ever go somewhere with such massive odds of death.
---
I honestly don’t know what wild Appalachia added to the game in terms of content for the average player. A couple of lame events and that’s it. I hope it’s substantial content
---
I have 12 of the 14 bugged. All of the build/play/play at X/kill dont register.
---
Only ones that work are the exam and one violent night.
---
I spent like 30 minutes and however many Cape to just jump to each location the Tourist spawns until I found it. Then once I found it, I can find them in every toolbox and locker I look in now haha
---
How did they spoil stuff on the English version it seems to be fine obviously they made the game in an English studio and had a problems with translators. But I'm curious as to what is in there that is a spoiler? Chances are you can already find info about it and game if not it'd be cool to know something new about it
---
That's not quite right I think. If you're in pacifist mode then your camp is invincible as long as you're not hostile to someone. It's most likely to specifically prevent players like you from going, "oh, a shop, I think I'll destroy it." No judgement or anything, just how it is. And VATS can no longer be used to initiate PvP, it won't target nonhostiles. It was too easy to use to identify targets.
---
People seem to like rare plans and reasonably priced 3* armor.
---
I'd offer 3-5k if you were trying to sell to me. Maybe a little more to the right guy.
---
Nice tip, but how does that help me revive players??
---
They are not account shared. I can't see those challeges with my other characters.
---
Just server hop the giant tea pot. They spawn bent over the picnic table. Might have to server hop 10-20 times :(
---
The same as the other masks, maybe less
---
Tried that for a bit, but then got annoyed by my camp having to be relocated and didn't want to have to reset it up. Laziness prevailed.
---
Fix melee! Please!
---
Ammo and plans.
---
So it would be like 1-3k? Arguing with a friend.
---
Wait what? Vats does in fact work on flying enemies, i've been using it the whole time.
---
Instead of saying like...take a of photo of this, or kill 50 enemies in VATS, or gather wood, it instead says Unlock Inferno Power Armor Mark III, or Reach Overseer Rank 186 or craft a Double Magazine or Meet a girl out of Vault 51 or even says Nuclear Winter Camo 3 . IDs are referring to wrong things, spoilers to be precise ahahahaha for future content
---
Bird bones mutation would be the major concern.  When we did it we both had to get a lot of rads in the river first to keep our health dowm... we both have healing factor and didn’t factor that in.
---
Nahhhh 400-1k
---
Whilst plus 1? What do you mean?
---
Because of the sales tax?
---
Pretty pricey for a static spawn, and 400 is not insignificant at a low level.
---
It's one of those things you just need to find the right buyer for.
---
In Fo76's favor, they have the 'dead before you know they're there' part already in place.
---
However if they must add new features for the sake of a sales pitch, then I would much prefer they add fishing.
---
Thought it was only 10%, if I’m right 10% of 590 Is 59 caps right?
---
Serums. I price mine 350-400 to prevent people from simply flipping them at vendors. If you do this, I hate you. I want to price mine at 200 so low levels can actually use them. If I wanted an easy profit I would sell them to vendors myself...
---
I also make a lot selling decent plans, rare ones from the newer events, Sheepsquatch weapons, low priced canned food like coffee and meat stew, the most popular ammo types, fusion cores, and junk like ballistic fiber and screws.
---
Yeah, I know how degradation works. Explosive and multiple-shot weapons suffer the most - but definitely not 20%-per-hit worst, that might be some kind of bug. Anyway, you should definitely look into gunsmith; it helps a lot.
---
Something similar happened to me, I think they only bought 200 caps worth of shotgun shells, but the notification shows the max stack you have for sale in the top left.  So maybe there are 390 still in the machine?
---
thx, still need more optinions because he wont be satisfied with one
---
That's even more concerning then since they just lumped it in with world challenges.
---
That's crazy. Does it say anything under the chemist different from " shoot a Yao guai ". I can't get that one to work.  But unfair no power armor Mark 3 would be pretty crazy same with double magazines or being an overseer or the fact that there's girls going to be in the game
---
The maths checks out. Maybe it's higher
---
Someone mentioned that the amount of ammo that appears is the total amount you have for sale, not the amount purchased.
---
No they don't, chances are you're seeing "diseased" legendaries. The diseased modifier causes the legendary tag to not display, but they are still legendary. This only happens on legendary mobs that get the "diseased" modifier which adds the toxic symbol at the end which overwrites the legendary star.
---
Yeah, I have it for sale in my shop, but I am a casual player. I maybe play 4 to 6 hours a week. That doesn’t leave a lot of time for someone to drop by and buy my stock.
---
I'd doesn't matter what they say or do at E3... it will all be bullshit.
---
'We won't add p2w to the atom store' does it anyway. 
---
'We're not making a battle royale game here' patches one in anyway.
---
Need I say more
---
I have done that a few times. I try to keep my eye out for lower level players to give things to.
---
Notice this sometimes too. But only by ammo. Everything else works perfect but ammo is bugged I think
---
It was broken in the last patch!
---
Bethesda tweeted a list of the most commonly sold items.  Remember, price will be the determining factor too.
---
https://imgur.com/a/r5lgZaA
---
Because having too much duped gear gets you banned.
---
Legendary scrip machine?
---
Well...it’s a female name, but I think she’s gonna be a bot or something. And Inferno Power Armor wasn’t the one from Fallout 3 ? Or was it Hellfire ? Maybe they are the same idk.
---
About the chemist one, under that tab it’s all small text which names random attachments or refers to dead IDs
---
Awesome thanks, I hadn't seen this.
---
People know the market. Gotta lower the prices if no one is buying
---
Pffffff, my screen/camera shot dont even get saved
---
The patch notes where Bethesda said they fixed the BUG causing legendary enemies to not drop legendary gear...
---
The MIRV mod is supposedly sold at one of the Watoga vendors but a bit of a hopping didn't grace me with its presence.
---
I just ended up caving &amp; putting 5 levels towards maxing Gunsmith then some to get it where I had it.
---
When I punch them.... I doubt there are any intact bits of flesh left to harvest a hide!
---
I'm stealing that line, thank yooouu
---
Then you are wrong, Bethesda has already said the legendaries not dropping legendary loot is a BUG and not intended. So the legendary modifier literally is supposed to mean it will drop a legendary.
---
That'll explain why I can't marsupial jump and bash scorchbeasts down to the ground! Any word on a fix?
---
Latest event plans for 100-200...sold maybe 2
---
Good guns like bloodied gatling laser, never sold one. 
---
Armor,only sold 3 piece of scout armor to the same guy.
---
So far vending is a complete failure to me.
---
He's correct. It's currently only a reward from the new dailies.
---
Where's rhe p2w? Where's the battle royale?
---
The attack on titans quote i've been searching for
---
Yeah I loved punching midair scorch beasts, it was bad ass! It's a problem for sting wings and blood bugs too!
---
This might be possible if only you could see it, and it showed a generic photo or something for everyone else.
---
Bloody melee isnt viable for pvp
---
The game was also designed to not have that many people in a shard, Maxing out around 20. The idea was to keep the feel of isolation in the wasteland. And that's great, but it runs counter to wanting us to group up with nearly half the server to do something. Not all will be of appropriate level or even interested.
---
I'm all but useless for the first half of queen fights for this
---
Odds are that they have already started progress on this, and you’re sol
---
I've had success selling plans, ammo, and stimpaks. But I sell my stuff at a reasonable price. I occasionally sell weapons, but not for 2000 caps for a lvl 20 2* laser pistol, like I've seen some players doing. It's just about having reasonable prices, or if you're charging a decent amount it better be something good d:
---
Let Bethesda do what it thinks it needs to do to keep this game alive.  BR can be fun if you have a fun attitude while playing it.  This will not be a seriously competitive pvp game, there are too many that do it better, but having a fun pvp side has its place.
---
Repair kits. 
---
Look at the patch notes for 'nuclear winter' all signs are pointing at a battle royale

I carry around a syringer that debuffs her and worst case scenario a pistol! Though I am trying to find the crystelizer barrel for my cryolator so we can get her to land more often!

I'd be inclined to agree but it was sitting in one of the boxes outside of the train stations. I have a sinilar habit of ditching ammo and mats I don't want in them. Also none of the items are the same. All different in some way
---
Where are all these good people? I have 3 characters and I've never had anyone do anything for me. Not that I expect them to but occasionally it would be.nice. like the other day my level 79 characters camp was attacked by 3 sb. There were 4 players not too far away. Close enough so they could see what was going on but did anyone help? Nope. The sb just about obliterated my camp. I was able to kill 1 before just getting fed up and logging off.
---
So I dont know where all these "good" players are but I've never seen them.
---
Interesting.  This is the information that I'm looking for.  Thanks
---
Even better!
---
Yeah they added a lot of stuff you need to grind for or spend a looot of time on
---
Fishing would be way better than battle royale
---
Any player will do.
---
Not a single point to move sadly, my build is unmovable without great lose for me. Maybe with the prestige system or with Bethesda effort to understand what is fun
---
They are probably close to done making it tbh. The voicelines are already in game files so
---
Curious what system you're on, those are more than likely duped. AAE anything just discarded like that clearly wasn't earned
---
I know that Bethesda has a ‘news article’ called inside the vault where they go over new and future updates - you should check recent ones
---
I can tell you from a melee metal armor build, the Furious 1*handmade I have FAR outshines any other weapon I've found myself. Sometimes I wonder how easy the game would be if I moved into rifle perks. Makes my non-bloodied melee build seem week.
---
That would mean this engine needs some sort of collision detection and hitboxes....
---
Hitbox porn this aint
---
Trippy I wonder if they just got the new squirrel scouts mixed up with it as no one knows how to become a squirrel scout or see their challenges yet
---
I second the legendary yao guai.
---
I've killed multiple, and I'm still missing this, the SBQ and I think the deathclaw..  which i literally camp on and kill daily
---
Although they are not in the game this is a good idea...Bethesda!
---
Sure it can be fun but just imagine how big of a laughing stock 76 will be cause it has battle royale. It just makes it seem like a caah grab and people will want to get the game even less
---

---
There was a post about what sells best in vendings - you could check that
---
I have a bunch of repair kits, all from the Queen, and I haven't used a single one. I can't imagine anyone actually *buying them* from the Atom Shop. So much for p2w.
---
But you said that they "patched in" battle royale... and they haven't.
---
Are you just crying for the sake of it or...?
---
They're still being awarded to me from the Camp Adams event and two daily quests. I sure hope it stays that way, as I just bought the Possum hat and outfit - should've bought the NVG lens first, I'm probably never going to use the outfit!
---
They are in the game. The really annoying laser turrets like the mini ones you see in whitesprings. They just need to use that and put the coding on from the other turrets.
---
Is there a (translated) roundup of all this accidental spoiler info? Because I’d like to see it if there is.
---
Did you need to save all three test subjects?  Rumor is 5hats the only way to get the plan to drop but I’ve been hearing that about different events for awhile now.
---
That is BS dude. You can still get 5k easy.
---
Batlle Royale wound’t be such a bad idea in my opinion. The PvP in survival is really screwed with all of the Two Shot-Instigating-Explosive guns. 
---
Getting a more or less fair PvP event where everyone starts with nothing and has 30 minutes to pick up stuff and kill everyone else would be a lot of fun.
---
System?
---
It did for a little bit but after 9.5 patch it stoped working for me again.
---
Ps4. Would be the first time I'd ever seen dupped stuff just get tossed like that. Especially given urban armor is so popular right now. Would really bum me out if thats  the case
---
Don’t know tbh, especially because it’s written in such a small and buggy text that you can’t read it. It’s not the usual text you find in those challenges, it’s very small and almost incomprehensible
---
None of these are exploits, you just dont know the PvP mechanics of the game.
---
pc
---
It’s is Battle Royal the data was already mined for this
---
Feel like it's really too late
---
They saw the success of Fortnite, it's too big of a potential success to *not* at least try it
---
I meant as items in camp but yes it wouldn’t be too hard to code them for defences
---
Less than what hits?
---
Could’ve said scripped. Specifically said scrapped
---
I'll give you 5.5k
---
I'm almost sure the Grafton station  has them, I got a few plans for radier and trapper mods from there. What were they not sure it's been a while.
---
&gt;misalliances
---
lol fn spell checker.... ya it is in the unworkable alliance Tab
---
and there is possum bage requiring to scrap deathclaw's skin
---
I think they (Tadpole challenges) show up in the challenges tab when you join the Scouts (and the Possum challenges when you get to Possum rank).
---
A clow?
---
Did you mean a cow?
---
Or did you mean a crow?
---
I'm not saying it would be a bad idea, I'm saying BGS said they would be doing it, and now they are.
---
Zero integrity leads to Zero trust.
---
I think something worth adding is that a reasonable portion of the time, all events roll to spawn nothing at all. So don't be surprised if you go to a location and nothing is there - these maps represent the spawn points but that doesn't mean anything will spawn.
---
Thx I haven't seen
---
Fair enough.
---

---
I've been having trouble with plasma cores degrading. I made ten of them the other day, and have not used them at all. Haven't touched my Gatling plasma at all.
---
I log back in four days later, and all my plasma cores have degraded to ~30 shots remaining. As I reload after burning one off, the number of shots decreases until the last two had 1 shot left each.
---
I wasn't aware plasma cores degraded 0.o
---
I do the same thing but with any large annoying mob like death claws, yao guai, Mirelurk Queens, and fog crawlers. Keeps them from staggering people and taking the focus off the scorchbeast queen.
---
I play in PvP mode because running across the odd player who is out to kill me because somehow even though I'm like bottom 3 in level I'm still number one on the leaderboard can actually be fun(I'm level 39 and always start as numero uno in a survival lobby). I but I still mainly do quests because the world's are underpopulated. Make PvP the mandatory mode and then add content. PvP is how it's supposed to be anyways
---
The battle royale gamemode would only be good if done right.
---
E.g. random loot from chests etc and storm closing in on certain points. Legendary enemies and power armour could be supply drops.
---
Looks like a trap...
---
Shhhh I like this bug. It’s good for my decorating 😉
---
As a counter point to people saying it was duped it could have been someone attempting to transfer items by rejoining stashing stuff and rejoining on a friend. They could be raging right now.
---
Just because you don't doesn't mean other people won't. 1 p2w thing on the store leads to more, and then more. 
---
I've used all of mine from the queen personally. 
---
It's not in yet, but it's coming. You know it, I know it, all of YouTube knows it. 
---
I'm not crying for the sake of crying- im complaining that they can't stick to a word that comes out of their mouths.
---
Someone could have been trying to transfer items between characters and you found their storage point.  Or duping, as most methods involve storing items and rolling back your inventory.  But either way, cheers!  Nice come up :)
---
If you get anywhere with this, I'd love to know! I've been playing nearly 800 hours now and I still can't find this plan. I buy every heavy metal piece I see to scrap it. I'm trying to learn the Polished effect. No luck thus far. I appear to have unlocked the majority of mods (lead lined, deep pocketed) so I'm hoping it'll happen sooner rather than later.
---
Would be really interesting to see the stats on adventure vs survival active players.
---
They aren’t supposed to. I fought the Queen and after starting with 13 cores I had 40 at the end of the fight. Everywhere from 50% and down. The original 13 was now 20 and the originals were all at 100% still.
---
How do I get those badges?
---
This. Been trying to get it on one of my toons with no success since it launched. Did the event on another and got it first time.
---
Raider camp places!  Lodge places!  All the places!
---
Honestly hope not!  Right in front of the door of a train station with no one there to tell people would be the absolute dumbest way to do that!  Especially for the amount of times people leave free gear and mats there. I've gotten many a 1 star from there over my time playing but nevrr like this lol
---
Man, any mods at all would make it a more useful gun
---
whenever i put screws up for sale i start to sweat, my hand starts shaking and i start chanting. I'm going to need 15 screws 6 minutes after someone buys them. the grind is real
---
lol or you mean good for repairing your deathclaw ? hmm j/k
---
I went to the monument fast travel by Philipi cemetary and server hopped until a tourist spawned on the deck beside the monument.
---
Nobody wants? Speak for yourself. Why are you people so scared of other players?
---
That Dad joke was so terrible I audibly groaned - take my upvote!
---
I have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Sorry. Never watched Attack on Titan.
---
Not strong enough to hold it? Don't expect free and easy junk from a PvP zone.
---
Atleast we will be able to prestige
---
Pretty positive this isnt the case, unless you're talking 100s of thousands of ammo.
---
Honestly, even that whole 900 hours guys sounded sketchy
---
Adventure mode has PvP too, like it or not.
---
Nuclear winter needs to be similar to the division survival mode NOT battle Royale please god!!!
---
The enemies healing is a big of a pain had a flat woods monster escape because of it once
---
The other masks are going to 10-100 caps.
---
Anybody paying more than that hasnt looked around long enough.
---
You could put an ad on r/fo76market
---
I'm guilty of doing that pretty often lol.  My mules can't move so I keep them all at one station, and if I'm lazy I transfer in the closest suitcase.  Definitely not for god rolls like those though.  What station was it??
---
AoE would be nice yes.
---
You're funny 😂. You want to know why? Because you're whining about me whining.
---
I've been putting stuff I normally bagged in the vendors for free.  Decent way to pass along ammo varieties I don't use.    I think common plans are next because they don't sell very quickly they take up quite a bit of weight.
---
Legendaries, junk, and aid you can't craft is where it's at!
---
Granny checking in on her SexBox, no fancy 'puter for this ole gal! ;)
---
First off it's called PvP, not griefing. Second, if someone can't hold their own workshop, even against other players too, they don't deserve the rewards.
---
I will purposefully destroy anybody in a workshop. Until people like OP get the hint that PvP is never leaving adventure completely, as it was always a part of the game.
---
I swear I got one today from the Deathclaw Island one...
---
Part of the danger trying to take valuable resources in a wasteland where other people want and may contest them.
---
Yeah that’s what we did
---
Just found 2 in Morgantown in the room where Steelheart is.
---
Before claiming the death of the game you could at least figure out that servers are capped at about 24 people. Otherwise you just look like an idiot.
---
Actually, no! :) XBox has plenty of nice players regardless of age -
---
There is a legitimate problem with VATS right now, exploit or not.
---
Dont tell someone they dont know the mechanics, when camps used to be able to be destroyed, and are SUPPOSED to be vulnerable in survival.
---
Would unyielding help a bloodied lever action? Some, but not as directly as melee. None of the specials boost ranged damage. 
---
The higher perception of unyielding would improve enemy spotting and VATS accuracy. Higher Agility would improve your sneak and AP. It's not as big of a difference. Armor will improve your stealth, save you fusion cores, but put you at risk of falling off cliffs. 
---
And scrap weapons and armor outside your power armor since the boosted unyielding intelligence improves your chances of learning mods.
---
You are a Legend dude!
---
With how they jitter sometimes right now?  Are you sure you're not just serving your own bias with little regard to server performance for everybody playing?
---
The balance, fps and overall performance are a joke, everything that a good PvP wants to avoid like the plague.
---
If Nuclear Winter is 100% PvP focused you bet it’s suicide.
---
Nope, I participated in 2 Encryptids, 3 SBQ, 4 Campfire tales etc on XBox yesterday
---
I want. I want. I want.
---
Had this same Bug with a dead scorchbeast :)
---
Some more informations ? Looking for Behemot
---
You can still go into that world, and when you go into another server your camp will remain.  As long as you dont place a new one down.
---
Eazy fix build a foundation under it and reconnect it with a wall then start deleting from top down
---
Thing is how would it choose which screenshots to put up?
---
If you're melee, carry a tesla rifle for tagging.   
---
Also, there aren't any instanced areas in the game. West Tek and Robco are not instanced. The game really needs instanced areas.
---
I think it was welch or Lewisburg.
---
Noob.
---
This is funny.
---
Wastelanders dlc will probably go forward in time and not just stop at scorchbeast queen
---
 I dunno if my post is too late but these have helped other people in your situation.......

---
Oh really??? Damn. Well, that's good to know!
---
For real? That's fucked up tho.
---
Got one from a vendor for 10 caps
---
Have yet to play the latest patch, but that's pretty bad then. I use vats quite a lot!
---
We don't know if Nuclear Winter will be an entire season based around Battle Royale (according to the general roadmap, we already know that there's going to be PVE stuff too). 
---
People were freaking out in this subreddit when Bethesda announced Survival; many thought that the only update we'd get would be PVP, that Bethesda was only going to focus on that... when it was pretty much the *only* big update, out of many, focused around Player Versus Player encounters.
---
So, what's wrong with a new gamemode? Some people might be into that. Some might not. The community is varied, here, and everyone needs some attention: we have people who loved Fasnatch, and others who didn't. We have people who want more hard events that tests their builds, and others who want more casual stuff and exploration. Nuclear Winter may be their own spin of Battle Royale, or just PVP focused, and that's fine-- there'll also be instanced Vaults (and who knows what else) to look forward to.
---
Hmm. That's bizarre. 
---
I showed up to a sbq fight with 15 plasma cores and the first couple had 498 shots displayed, and the rest were super low.
---
There's clearly something weird going on with plasma cores.
---
Done it a few times, we usually got for the sbq when we do this.
---
If you want to get rid of the shitter pieces of ammo, sell them for 0 caps. I also sell bulk of common junk at &lt;1 cap per raw piece, and then just a shit ton of plans
---
CATCH PHRASE!
---
Well Fo76 was fun the first few weeks because PVP was actually pretty lit! However, once dupe glitches came into light, PVP just wasn't worth it anymore since it was a 1 shot fiasco. One of my favorite memories of the game is taking out 7 people at once at the Golf Course, then having them report me as a hacker. All 7 eventually became my friend because I returned all their junk + more to them.
---
Melee cleave/hit multiple targets would be awesome. Could also work with Scorch Beasts and Scorch Beat Queens. I'm honestly surprised their big wing sweeps when they're on the ground doesn't hit multiple targets. I'd be worried about it being a little op in certain scenarios though. Maybe make it a perk card?
---
I've got 425 but I'm sure it could go higher.
---
Same, I only killed one person in all my time playing, my buddy had a bounty and wanted it gone.
---
I don’t understand why people take their junk for this events, this said.....
---
Farm caps &gt; buy what you want from vendors
---
^ the true endgame
---
I think its 245 with 15 agility, but if you use chems or unyielding armor it can go higher
---
Hi There! I run a Bloodied/Unyielding Stealth Commando build, lvl 240 and I'm currently using an Automatic Bloodied Combat Rifle as my main weapon.
---
The Dps is lower per bullet but lays down more damage due to its faster firing rate.
---
As an example: my Bloodied Lever Action if I'm at 20% health is around 400dmg per bullet before any other perks or stealth multipliers kick in whereas the Auto Combat Rifle is around 200dps per bullet.
---
The other main factor is rounds per clip and the ACR has 20 rounds while the LA holds 5.
---
Both Weapons are amazing! It really boils down to play style and bullets :) I carry no less than 10k rounds of .45 ammo at all times.
---
Then there would be no diversity, everybody would be running the same gear, or be stupid not to, nobody would need anything traded for, and all of the casual players whining now, about how PvP is unfair and PvE is ruined because of these "god builds" stealing every kill, will whine harder about how it should take less time, they should be able to compete, etc. 
---
Why should someone be granted the same power for half the effort?
---
I would like vats to work with Melee weapons first. Something in the last patch won't let me use my deathclaw gauntlet at all in vats. And while I know I shouldn't need it that mechanic should still at least work.
---
I for one have never got badges from the 2 tadpoles events.
---
I’ve got max agility and bird bones... d you use a full set of unyielding?
---
I just feel it’ll be a new feature for after nuking something, as a test mode at first, then they’ll put it into the actual game or remove it.
---
That would be Awesome and more realistic!
---
Yeah man, it freaking blows. I guess I will bring my handmade out off retirement for a while lol
---
I'm on PS4, same as Reddit username.
---
6gb but I'll give that a shot anyways.
---
So how are repair kits p2w? I haven't seen anyone "winning" with them... in fact, I haven't seen anyone buying them.
---
So you are basically speculating?
---
This reminds me how eso did a pvp mix pve thing for its first dlc that had some amazing storylines but people got so butthurt and are still to this day that in the end it was majorly pvp focused that they have not done another dlc like it 5 years later.
---
The sheepsquatch doesn’t stun, it staggers, which every melee weapon can do when power attacking.
---
The 2h perk does this with all rise
---
And I have the agile perk that lets me reduce 90% melee weapon weight 
---
It’s freakin great
---
Rank 3 on one trough is better than rank 1 on all three. That and sometimes there aren't enough people to spread out.
---
Nah I've never been able to even keep that much on me. I just ditch what I'm not currently using then regret it later when I find a worthwhile use for what I ditched.
---
Duped.
---
Someone who legitimately got that stuff might give one of those things away to a single person. But all that for free?
---
Sounds like getting rid of evidence. Good score for you, though.
---
I'm not seeing it mentioned, so I thought I'd say that "Refrigerated Backpack" shows up in Effects and lists the stat at 60%.  Not as good as "Good With Salt, but frees up a perk slot.
---
do they exist on pc version?
---
Stop that shit.
---
Stacks ofu
---
Do you hold onto the workshop or do you abandon it. I agree if you hold onto it then it's PVP but if you just do it to start PVP then you are a griefer but don't call it PVP when your only purpose is to be a dick there is a survival server for that but I assume that's to difficult for "PVP"for some players and they go after the low hanging fruit adventure mode players.
---
Hmm ok ... I'll rank on those for a bit. I'm max rifle right now with the gauss.
---
Pretty much its not a case of all people who play on the console are like that but enough of them are to give it a bad name.
---
Then again you also run into your fair share of tools on the pc Verison anyway so dont think too hard about it.
---
So you’re only here to complain about a game you didn’t actually buy?
---
&lt;3
---
How do you know if people are buying them or not? I've seen at least 2 YouTube creators buying them. How would you know they're bad If you didn't try them? 
---
As for not winning with them- what are you doing all day? because any big boss I fight my guns break at least once, I don't have time to be flying out to repair my stuff and coming back... that's when I've been using my improved kits. 
---
If some kid is sinking his wage into basic kits I know they're using em when they're hopping world's trying to get queen kills. Going off the amount of elitists in this sub there's atleast a couple of hundred people buying basic kits.
---
Harpers ferry is full of violet flux and you have the burrows there.
---
I hate this.  It's such a tool move.
---
I’m 100% PvE but my friends only play PvP so when they want to play I’ll join on my least favorite character
---
How exactly do you get her to land more? I'm mostly melee so I could use this info.
---
B-b-b-but Battle Royal!
---
Reading the stuff being posted here is eyerollingly sad. There is more to PvP than friggen battle royal, FFS. And there was talk about team deathmatch well before the data-mining. Just chill and wait.
---
Never mind the whole broforce ratshit mode, it's not like we haven't been getting PvE content as well. If they want to add a butthurt roflstomp mode, *let them.* Nobody said YOU had to play it.
---
Fusion cores, plans, treasure maps, assassins armor, serums
---
I literally cannot keep screws in stock. Shotgun shells and fusion cells sell all the time as well (Jesus, try saying that out loud). Lead usually sells.
---
All worth 10 atoms
---
I saw molerats unlock lvl3 doors.
---
After the duping wave they aren’t rare anymore.
---
Best post today, so far 👍😉
---
Yes. I love people selling rubber. Makes hitting vendor max a breeze.
---
This just in; 1000% of the fanbase agrees that these statistics are completely made up.
---
nah man, there are plenty of nice ppl out there, im on xbox and ive made many friends at whitesprings, sometimes people have never thought about the tagging and how loots works for everyone.
---
invite them to a team, talk to them and more often than not you'll end up with nice people.
---
I know but he had to start dumping them somewhere no? 5 to him, 3 to the next and so on.
---
Or maybe you're mad 'cause you're in the same spot eh.....felling guilty?
---
It would be cool if we could actually swing and hit an enemy.
---
No it doesn't. Why are you literally lying.
---
Really?  That sucks.  Have you tried fixing, or is it behind your control.
---
yeah but, do they exist on pc version or console only? (not from dev room, only dropped)
---
Honestly, they just need better rewards for successful objectives. If you had two 3 star items guaranteed to drop from completing Encryptid successfully, you bet your ass that people would CLICK THE FUCKING PYLONS, CHAD!!
---
That's a keeper.
---
Purely aesthetic :)
---
Instigating is amazing, lets say base damage is 200, +40% power attack for 280, then ×2 when enemy is full health for 560 damage, which isnt too bad. I would keep my eye out for bloodied weapons though  my power fist can do base damage 650 pretty easy.
---
I’m not sure, I just read that they duped a to. Of them but I don’t know what platform. I haven’t seen one on PC, anywhere. If that’s the case than it’s still rare, which makes it worth a lot to the right person.
---
There are two methods, you cripple her wings, which is best done with either a skeet shooter enforcer shotgun. Or I've heard reports that a crystelizer cryolator is also suitable!
---
I have 200. I just HAD to have the Black Rider and then the Pale Rider and now I'm broke lol BUT I WILL SAY that it looks great combining the two: Black rider torso &amp; arms , the rest pale, very nice combo
---
Because I haven't met anyone buying them at all. In fact, most people say that they have plenty from the Queen - and those are *improved* repair kits.
---
My guns are repaired to 160%, and even with randoms fighting the Queen I have no problems at all. Not even with my BE laser (which is pretty bad, btw).
---
Sure, some people might be stupid enough to buy the basic ones. But are they winning? How?
---
Add me sometime... UnabatedGinger
---
If they want to be stubborn, let them learn the hard way.
---
I'm trying to make like 4 floors going down the side of a hill but I tried taking some of the floors down and it says the same thing
---
You know what those guys hate? doing the loop in reverse.
---
It's random my man. Just keep hitting those random encounters and you'll get there
---
Nah I never clicked on that one as well. For me survival mode is havin to drink and eat all the damn time And just trying to stay alive XD
---
My friend had 5 legendaries drop twice in a row on one corpse each.
---
I'll pay 10k on xbo
---
Ah, makes sense.
---
I actually *love* PvP, but even I'm not interested in a BR.
---
Sorry already sold
---
Because they can repair the gun mid fight. 
---
That's fucking 'winning' in this context you dense fucker.
---
How about just getting rid of those stupid one shot builds and weapons? 
---
Funny cause I just posted a similar sentiment. Way too many self centered players using those one shots, (mostly duped) to farm legendary enemies now so they get get more Scrips to buy new legendarys items  so they can to farm legendary enemies. And on and on and on.........
---
Its sort of sick behavior ? All I wanted was some fluids for Camp building but couldnt get any due to the one shot dude taking all the loot.
---
Dang.
---
I don't think a wall would happen but perhaps a photo album like a static camp item but you'd interact to like a terminal maybe? I don't know if that would work or not
---
It's just more efficient to kill ghouls quickly all 4 people on team will get loot, if you are not on this team try organising own team and nuke on different server.
---
About respawn one person is force closing game after every circle and rejoin that what's causing ghouls to respawn, if you don't quite the game nothing will respawn. Personally i don't like how Bethesda is trying encourage people to server hope and reload game frequently. Even the new camera is based on server hoping where tourist can spawn, people not active on Reddit don't even have camera.
---
Why are you salty? It's just a videogame.
---
I can repair the gun mid fight, to a better condition, and I haven't spent one single atom.
---
These are so fucking dumb like they always are lol.
---
Instigating. Ghouls and Scorched for example really don't have armor. Mirelurks, Scorchbeasts, Gulpers, Super Mutants, Deathclaws and the shrimp from Far Harbor are armored.
---
I believe that limb damage stacks on a weapon and it should stack with enforcer. Another  example would be using a perforating mag, on an anti armor sniper and also using tank killer.
---
That obligation to play is called FOMO. Fear of missing out. Sorry to be the one to say it, but it's your problem and not a problem with the game mechanics.
---
it might be, it might not
---
Yeah, if it’s a lower level and stuck in a wall or floor, you cal frag or Molotov cocktail it too.
---
Got mine for 100
---
Pretty sure the reason they made vertibots was to have the mechanic of verti-something but try to avoid us all asking “hey why can’t we ride in these”
---
Its be nice for more random hits.
---
Harpers Ferry is a great spot....
---
Honestly anywhere but Whitespring and Prime.
---
Oh my... It's the Internet Explorer himself!
---
Tenderizer must work wonders with this build.
---
Also, give me the formuoli!
---
Cancer is cancer. Battle Royale is a game mode, silly goose.
---
I don't know what nuclear winter is going to be, but I always thought it would be fun if they had a new hard mode or change the dynamics of the world to make it much more difficult and more survival based. Probably won't happen but I thought it would be cool. Also maybe a PVP server that doesn't allow the use of legendaries. Now all the so-called PVP masters could really show us those skills and not lean so heavily on specific armor and weapon prefixes.
---
I will be bitterly disappointed if another game mode is released for pvp. Especially so if it's battle royale. Everyone I know who plays this game is not here for PvP at all.
---
 Survival mode has shown that world PvP is barely a play style outside of "sneak and get the first 1shot in". Short of a complete combat rework from the ground up battle royale is just a bad idea.
---
Please Bethesda, stop trying to make PvP happen and make content for the vast majority of the player base.
---
PC here. Less nuke drops, and less turnout at the harder events because FFS PEOPLE CLICK THE PYLONS! But still plenty of folks on and plenty of sales in my camp.
---
Get out of here with your logic &amp; sense OP. 
---
(Please Bethesda.  Deathclaw hides are the new unruly golfer.)
---
Anyone carrying Instigating should also be carrying an effective weapon for enemies not a full health.
---
Random chance and duping wasn't effort lol.
---
Most games have top tier or meta gear that can be earned. No problem if it was the same here.
---
they duped it on xbox, I don't know about the other platforms
---
Do it. I haven launched one myself yet, but that damn waterpark would be sweet to nuke.
---
It's not only weapons it's build, i can one shot with non legendary gear, nerfing weapons will cause people with hoarder builds get absolutely devastated they will struggle with any enemies.
---
You da mvp
---
Alot of ppl hate pvp coz its broke so Bethesda plz reconsider to not make it an pvp focused dlc there is enough pvp in 76 like bounty system the hunter hunted and survival mode
---
I’m going to agree with you. 
---
In fallout games I’ll always be PVE, BUT I think it’s great they focus on players who want a little more action than adventure sometimes has to offer. There’s  definitely both types of players and by spreading them out this way that they have done is a thumps up from my side 👍🏼
---
I would love to farm it tbh
---
PSN is Thebeard74
---
OMG you guys! Hes not gonna visit us!!! 
---
Change your whole base!!!
---
What the hell my comment is two weeks old
---
I personally dont care what the mode will be. The public opinion on the game just might completely collapse. Any positivity they might have gotten with the updates thus far can go away with just one announcement of a gamemode. And its all back to "76 is trash" thing like we had on launch
---
I'm not entirely against the idea of a Battle Royal. It depends on how it's implemented and designed. A regular BR game mode is a little played out at this point BUT, if it's not in an open world environment but instead entirely within a Vault I think that could be an intriguing spin on it.
---
Yeah I’ve been out of the loop on F76 for a while and I’m catching up.
---
I'm just sitting here reading all these "Paradise broken" threads unable to form my own opinion since nobody is even wanting to try for it on the servers I play on...
---
Let me understand, you behead (bloody mess) foxes, wild dogs, cows and a hundred other animals but the frog should have a bigger home?
---
Sorry I went to sleep... just my server
---
I don't remember any sort of promise of human NPC's. Source?
---
Oh no the fixer is no good to me anyway. I meant I had those things in my vending. I do have pretty nice guns, but I got really no extra I could trivially just vend away for caps.
---
Dude I would love if we could play the board games
---
You mean the real vault right? Since this is all a Vault-Tec simulation anyways...
---
most of f76 players are casual. that is why most pvp servers are empty
---
Im not scared of other players. But i'd rather play with friends and experience a story together rather than fight each other. Also the BR scene is kinda dying out now. Every time a new BR mode or game is announced people roll their eyes at it. I just feel its too late to hop on the BR wagon
---
Wipes a tear from eye..see this is the raider generation I been talking about
---
PvP being the weakest thing about the game is probably why they’re doing it. They’re taking a weak feature and making it less-weak (hopefully, we’ll see) as a way to attract more people to the game.
---
I came to say this
---
My friend is quitting 76 if it's a br. I keep telling him this and that they aren't removing the stuff you like, just play that.
---
I’m only replaying it to try and get the stimpack diffuser. Do I have a chance?
---
3. Large magazine
---
Chameleon absolutely stacks
---
Oh, then it’s still worth a lot on the other platforms. I had heard only two or three even dropped on PC for the entire event.
---
Yeah no they are waaaayy to late to hop on the BR wagon now. I dont think theres much people still want out of the BR mode thats not already offered by some other game out there. If it ends up being a battle royale, I just hope it wont be a disaster...
---
This is what Weaponskills are for.  Various forms of increased attack, multiple hit, and affects.
---
Sent a request
---
I just hit save on my nvidia replay, upload the video and send it to Bethesda in a player report.
---
They probably won't ban if they've spent any money on the cash store (seen that a few times in MMOs) but it's worth a try.
---
Players like that really are a blight on the community
---
May not have made a difference, but be sure to wave when players come into your view, and if you need help, do the help emote.  I’ve come across players that do their own thing, and if they don’t wave I assume they are not interested.
---
they took fast travel mats a long time ago, unfortunately
---
I personally dont care what the gamemode is. What I care about is how it might crash and burn their reputation theyve built up in the last 6 months with the updates
---
Me too
---
huh? 30 minute questline + sidequests for impostor sheepsquatch, 20 more minutes worth of a dumbass drinking questline, and a session and a half to earn the backpack? Oh I almost forgot, campfire tales 30 times to earn a mod for the backpack. THRILLING CONTENT OMG SO MUCH TAKE SOOOOOOO LONG.
---
He’s not kidding. Just go the opposite way. Hahah
---
Not for me. The game feels more alive than ever. I'm actually seeing other people doing events instead of farming Whitesprings. (This is a good thing) The latest round of 100+ players are getting the hang of the SBQ. I've got caps galore and I'm making new friends chatting up customers or vendors.
---
Maybe it's time you started a new character....
---
Boxes in Fort Defiance have them from time to time
---
You need to find tourist to gain ability to fix camera and use it, Bethesda is trying to teach people how to server hop, don't ask me why 🤔
---
i remember being able to fast travel to our teammates workshops a long time ago, maybe they changed their mind or it's glitched. I don't know why it would be a bad thing.
---
Sounds like a good idea!
---
Yea me2. I'm making it slowly on the main aswell. Just focusing on level and farming everything. I want this game to last as long as I can make it! Lol I've Hit level 20 and I'm only 6 missions into the main. I've done a few side but that's about it
---
I know you can find them in the world. But for whatever reason the Deathclaws don't drop them 🤷‍♂️
---
No to all of that.
---
Sure. Just remove instigating, power attack, bloodied, sneak attacks, VATS crits and make all the enemies even bigger bullet sponges. It would solve one problem and create a dozen more... or just share XP and loot with everyone within an event and/or limited radius.
---
I'd say for others just let them see generic placeholder pictures instead of one's of their own, but that'd be a good solution. 
---
Perhaps let party members see your pictures, which means only they end up downloading your screenshots,  and only when in range of your camp.
---
Still though, there's certainly a risk of exploits anytime one user can cause others to download something, so it may be something they choose to avoid. 
---
(If I replace the picture I'm using as a screenshot with a malicious file, can I inadvertently get others to download it? Then when the game attempts to load this file can I get the game to do nasty things? They'd need to be validating files or storing screenshots serverside or something else that would be expensive performance-wise)
---
Bethesda is trying to tell people: server hoping over team work... Always.
---
I agree. But just imagine how it looks to the public. A game thats reception was awful and that probably didnt sell too well and is still pretty broken in some aspects, adds a battle royale mode. It can just screw up the last bit of respect Bethesda and 76 had
---
I think he’s saying “yes they do need to change it so that Deathclaws drop their hides”, not “yes they do drop them”
---
The antique shop NW of Watoga sometimes has one on the shelves on the ground floor. If you're on PC, might have a spare.
---
I really like the no legendary idea. There's not much skill involved spamming jump and raining explosive shots.
---
Same for me. My alt was on the final step of Rose's quest-line that was reset back to searching for the keys.
---
Right. Cause melee isn't strong enough already...
---
Morgantown but don't hit Morgantown train station. Get all those ghoulies by VTU glowing!
---
You would know that i corrected myself, if you took the time to read the rest of the comments...gj pal.
---
Vault 51 better not be PvP, I like exploring vaults and it'll be a shame to have one I'll never explore.
---
Damage per second usually equates to more than damage per shot overall when thinking about reload times of non automatic rifles. My bloodied sniper puts out 455 damage per shot but takes a total of 3 seconds to fire and reload, my anti armor assault rifle does 110 per shot but can fire 6 bullets in the same 3 seconds totalling 660 damage in the same time frame. Commando perks and gun fu together makes for a brilliant combo the same with automatic pistols if you have the points put into agility for it. I use rifleman cards when I need to stock back up on ammo for my automatic rifles
---
The quests were ok but it just overall feels like a chore to get through them. Especially all the stuff with the scouts
---
Yes you should. 
---
But you decide ;)
---
what happened next?!!!
---
Still haven't found a camera either. I did one time but I didn't realise that that was the one I should've been looking for as it did say "Broken" I never saw it again. And now I fear I am screwed.
---
I've wasted £13 on far less entertaining stuff in the past. Would do it again too :D
---
Apologies I badly worded this title, I ment to say the promised there wouldent be any human npc ever. Post ruined laying my head in shame.
---
Plas gats are one of the best weapons in game now, assuming all other things equal.
---
Certain weapons still have close range hit problems, but not as bad.
---
SB's can be hit with VATS so long as they're in range.
---
Armor/Underarmor does not stack with PA.
---
When I nuked Whitespring last night there was a group doing that. I was running ahead of them tagging everything with my Tesla though as I just needed high radiation fluids and didn’t give two f***s about anything else. 
---
They probably thought my weapons were underpowered as I rounded the corner with 50 ghouls in tow, leaping over their heads to a rooftop to turn and watch.
---
Me too!
---
Just like how a scorched with a shotgun should drop the shotgun and not a machete
---
Pls don't let Nuclear Winter be Battle Royale.
---
Pls let Wastelanders be a proper Fallout story.
---
Fallout 3 remastered maybe? Maaaaayyyybeeee?
---
What's your ign
---
There's a random BoS encounter in the Bog where it's ghouls and dead BoS with a conscription note and dead Brahmin. I've acquired it from the corpses and the Brahmin.
---
One-shotting is fine I suppose, though it should be because you're not paying attention and unable to dodge somehow.  The one-shotting unable to revive hits are the particularly bothersome ones.
---
It tickles me to think that your "saviour" could've been the reason you were attacked by a level 65 deathclaw in the first place :D
---
Does the same dmg as the powerful auto receiver, but also increases crit shot dmg.
---
They spawn all over the place. any random spawn point.
---
It's not that it's "Not possible", it's just that from a performance perspective it's quite expensive for the value it brings.
---
It's certainly possible to allow a user to upload an image to the server, and have the server distribute that to all other clients. But given that there are a few dozen users per server, people would want to be able upload multiple files each, and they need to do significant checking over the files for malicious content, there's just a lot of overhead for camp pictures.
---
Someone in the thread suggested local-only images, and I think that would work fine and be easy (generic picture for others, your pictures for you). It just kind of goes against the online environment the game tries to achieve.
---
Not sure I can do bloodied, I feel pretty squishy at full health as it is.   Still trying to work out the healing factor mutation.  Died alot since it got it...
---
agreed
---
Once you've started the quest by finding the original one, they seem to start spawning in the world. That and a vendor at WS has 2 on its inventory every time I go by. They show up under misc I think, and they cannot be dropped/traded/sold only used to make camera or drop.
---
You need to find tourist (you will know you find him as he got holotape that starts bucket list quest and unlock camera repair option for you) without finding him all broken cameras are just junk nothing you can do with them.
---
You talking about yourself but what about the people who like pvp? The only threat in this game are other players, adventure is way too easy and people like me who has different characters and have been playing since beta with over a thousand hours have nothing to do on adventure mode. I wish I had something to do on adventure but at the moment there is nothing to do.
---
Yes that would be nice too.
---
Cries in shotgun
---
True.
---
I hope it's a kind of hardcore mode; the Survival is not even close to brutal enough for me. Somewhere between Fallout 4 Survival and Frost would be good.
---
Nah melee is already overpowered(for some reason).
---
I agree this would be better but I have been enjoying logging on for a few min every day.
---
I payed over $70 and I would do it again
---
I get a radrat or wolf every once in a while, but that's it really. I moved back in to the same spot
---
Yeah, I might let you tag a legendary (if you don't display this attitude) but I am not going to wait around for you to tag all the trash mobs or adjust my playstyle for you.
---
Submit a support ticket, I've heard of refunds in the past
---
Very cool, that was what I was hoping to be the case!
---
Come on be honest both modes are half empty, how many nukes you see these days? How many high level players you see on adventure? Not many.
---
I think it's going to be a complete environmental devastation as a result of the million nukes we've dropped on Appalachia. And then the Wastelanders bring in New factions to this actual wasteland, hence why it's called Wastelanders.
---
It's true. They hate that. But I normally run it in reverse anyway :P
---
I thought that too, but i maxed serendipity which is 45% chance of dodging when below 30% health, plus nerd rage, cavalier/bolstering/unyielding armour and it makes a big difference. I was running a two handed melee with full vanguard but the bloodied is really strong.
---
Its great if people will enjoy it. And im not saying pvp shouldnt be a thing. Its just that the games reputation might tank even more. People will say how "oh theyre hopping on the bandwagon" "haha what a terrible game" yknow. Even less people will want to play it. I doubt BR is a thing that can bring money and players into a game like 76
---
I had the exact same issue. Bought something accidentally due to lag.
---
Bethesda refunds it without issue.
---
Great service, but yes report it as a ticket on the site.
---
Do stuff. Also things, do those too.
---
At least you spawn on the ground. Me? 8 out of 10 i spawn overlooking the map, fall through it, recycled back up then dropped on solid ground causing instant death to my bloodied/unyielding character.  Every time i use that character i always have to remember to get in PA before logging out.
---
&gt; Feel like it's really too late
---
everything about this game is too late,i don't know anyone since launch that still plays,i tried to defend this game for so long but the content is simply not there
---
It’s a fail safe so you don’t lose anything on a crash. Pain in the ass to be honest but better than losing everything.
---
Whoops, you're right.  Switched them in my mind.  Does seem that things have gotten a lot better since then.  Haven't even tried it out yet...
---
Damnit, seriously?! I did this a couple of weeks ago with some random skin, I'd gueas it's too late now.
---
I really enjoy PvP and honestly a BR in this game would be stupid as fuck, and I think everyone is incredibly sick of the flood of BR’s right now
---
A simpler explanation would be that you hit the transfer all key inadvertently, just like when you go to pick up a bag of scrap. 
---
Unless you were on the beta PvP server, your rsisk of suddenly gettong one-shotted at a train station seems pretty low, but sorry to hear you had to put all your loot back in the box.
---
It’s a blast. Do it.
---
I've still never encountered one.
---
But the thing is, anything that can deal damage should also be able to take damage, otherwise it's Hello Kitty Trap Camp mode
---
Does it overwrite both the star and the Legendary title? I’ll have to keep that in mind and pay attention going forward.
---
Sheepsquatch is kind of conditional, much like the Scorchbeast Queen.  If there aren't many high-level players on the map, you probably won't find much support.  But you can't always judge it.  Usually when I do the SBQ, about 6-8 others show up, but there have been times when it might be one other player despite that.
---
My take on the Sheepsquatch and the SBQ is that it's just something you \*do\* when it happens, especially if it's a low-level who started it, because you want to give them the win.  But Arktos, pretty early on, I just stopped caring and I don't see it in the same way.
---
Check outside of the giant teapot i found mine on a dead tourist that was laying a cross on a picnic table
---
Love uh... uh... uh... finds a way.
---
Are you referring to the weight without perks versus real weight?
---
Next time I guess I bring out my tse dragon...
---
I do that from time to time as well. Hoarder and inpulse player vendor buyer. Usually its a situation where somebody needs something modded on reddit, ill look a their gear and give items that are taking stash space and give to them.
---
Just paying kindness forward.
---
Also all those weaps you mentioned are pretty heavey, wouldnt be surprised if person was different weap build and couldnt use or sell.
---
An event in which you just chill for 20 minutes.. sounds like how most people play encryptid tbh
---
It's like the skull mask but there are many hat they fit just try out
---
Adrenal reaction (mutation), Nerd rage (int perk) Radicool (end perk) Emergency protocols (power armor mod) and unyeilding armor are the foundation to a good bloody build. 
---
Add to that any and all damage boosting perks/mutations you can squeeze in. Adrenaline. Bloody mess. Tenderizer. ect...
---
I like to use the combination of mysterious savior and revenant.
---
I just went through a quest where i spend a good 15+ minutes hunting down wolf pack leaders and when the last boss spawned some guy teleported over and sprinted over and 1 shot it before i could even get close enough to tag it. It's frustrating coming to play a game and enjoying the missions only to have someone grief the mission then somehow go missing from the recent player list so you can't block them.
---
I want to build arcades
---
I pray its just a series of fun PVP minigames that happen as an event up in vault 51. A full-blown battle royale would die almost instantly imho. But having FFA or TDM or Capture the Flag or Snipers Only or Fists only would be awesome and some fun PVP with no real consequences and cool vault themed event rewards would be something im sure the casuals would really enjoy.
---
I totally agree, the reason the game “failed” isn’t because there isn’t a BR mode. I personally think Bethesda should make a proper story DLC with characters and multiple endings. It could take a year to make it and it would probably have to pay to play it. I don’t care, I just want some sort of story.
---
I have only killed players when i was between lvl6 and lvl 20 after that it just gets to hard and im now lvl 98
---
COME HEREEEE
---
I defended Bethesda and 76 from the Beta. I’ve been mostly happy with how they have handled it this far even. Yet, of Bethesda does go the battle royale route, I’m done because it’s going to demonstrate that the company is going to give up on story and substance like so many others.
---
At the expense of a fusion generator
---
Tactical ops is classed as casual isn't it? That's why I never bothered with it. Also the lining plans are bugged so you can't get protected or shielded.
---
Bethesda wants to ride the fortinite express.
---
But honestly i just want more story based questing. Kinda like human NPCs. All the humans are dead in 76.
---
Role playing would be fantastic!
---
&gt;We don't know if Nuclear Winter will be an entire season based around Battle Royale (according to the general roadmap, we already know that there's going to be PVE stuff too).
---
You're right on the money... from what I've read about what's been data mined, it's also going to to have the ton go in basically naked, no legacy builds.
---
I'm not a huge PVP player, however I have had fun with it  when it's happened in FO76...the biggest issue I had was that a lot of the legacy legendaries and quirks of some of the builds made it very unbalanced, both for and against me at different times.  If Bethesda can fix that, even if it's by the simple expedience of making everyone start a new toon, then I'll give it a shot. Especially if,  as it is currently rumored, you cannot switch back and forth from adventure mode. That'll keep things separated and on a level playing field.  
---
As you mentioned we know, from the roadmap, that PVE is also going to get some love. I'm actually very excited to see what they're going to do with this.  I think that E3 is going to be a bit rocky for Bethesda,  but it seems like they know what they're walking into and they're going to just plough through it. It'll be a very interesting week! 😂👍
---
Then i'm curious what you meant? 😊
---
I sell .50 all day long with zero issues.
---
Not an even but a player hub with vendors and workbenches similar White Springs
---
Not that many! I tried all of mine and only a few I have worked. I don't own all the hats or anything but all of the dress hats clip :(
---
There were three I found that worked but I wasn't a fan of them. The BOS hood, the military cap and the newsboy cap
---
I really just wanted to use it with a bowler hat or top hat
---
If they add area attack damage to melee they would have to scale back the high direct damage melee already has. Or they could make melee more interesting by making some weapon types do more area damage for crowd control and others with more direct damage for fighting large strong enemies.
---
Yes you should. It is way more fun than the division 2 which I dropped $120 on. Would have rather spent the 120 on this game.
---
Might be good one or two times but it would get borning real quick.
---
Same.
---
It doesn't meant there is no issue, you're definitely in minority.
---
We’re getting a new Main Questline with the Wastelander Season.
---
so this must be a bug because sometimes the card stays on with buffs.   very strange.    i think bethesda needs to address this.
---
Whatever Nuclear Winter is going to be, development has been underway for months and it's not going to pivot now in response to a Reddit post, so I suggest we save our bellyaching for *after* it's officially revealed.
---
So tired of this question. Just search "should I buy" in this forum and read the answers. 
---
And if you buy it and don't like it, there's no need to post and tell us you're leaving.
---
Fooduilders downvoting as usual lol
---
There’s an entire roadmap that Bethesda released that explicitly shows that they have big plans for story-focused content that are already in the works.
---
Can the power plant be restarted by just one player?
---
The combat helmet works, pre war hat, green hood, metal helmet.... My favorite is the pre war hat that looks like a melon, don't know how it calls in English
---
Might be good that it did. There was a rose quest that was bugged. You'd reach a certain step and be stuck. Maybe to fix it they had to reset it.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bn33ul/is_this_worth_buying_or_coming_back_to_the/
---
Unfortunately, they are all people trying to sell junk for 100c per bulk. I generally avoid WS camps.
---
I mean it's too late for them to turn back. The DLCs have been planned since before release
---
That's basically how I see it too - a reaction to players saying the other events were too easy.  So, it's like they threw up their hands, cobbled together a kitchen sink of objectives, and said "Have fun."
---
It probably looked more fun on paper.  But in practice, it really does rely on players being on the same page when it comes to prioritization, or else everything fails very quickly.  The problem is, because the structure of Arktos prevents you from seeing beyond the chamber you're in, it's impossible to make an informed decision.  There is no vantage point where you can see everything and make the call like there is with the Imposter or the SBQ.
---
And it's relatively low-hanging fruit: they've already got the huge map and the PvP mechanics. I think they'd actually be fools not to try, given the risk/reward ratio.
---
I think more than 10% of players want good PvP in FO76. Right now it's pretty much an after thought.
---
yep, it's weird. during project Paradise every enemy's name is replaced with weapon and armor's
---
like imagine fighting that alpha but he's called combat shotgun...
---
i agree with op though, this thing is annoying because the base translation for the game is very very good
---
Not so bad then, frustrating but should be fixed eventually.
---
Imagine if you will.. BR in this engine... Huge lag, stuttering.. Just shit performance all around. If they want to make a laughing stock of a BR game by all means Bethesda... Have at it.
---
Heres hoping Wastelanders is what Fallout 76 could have been in the first place
---
I don't have a green hood maybe that could look okay.
---
I really just got it for a steam punk look though you know? Top hat with some sort of suit and a railway rifle
---
Looking at the player bases for Fortnite and Apex, it appears not everyone has a stick up their arse regarding BR.
---
Remember how lots of little things in wild Appalachia are connected. Need the camera to do challenges for the scouts . What if not playing this BR mode means you don't get whatever item it offers , then two weeks later the next update comes out, turns out now you have no choice but to pvp in BR just to complete the new pve quest. This is what concerns me. I didn't care about or want to get a camera. But when the scouts came out my arm was twisted . I will not play a game mode with a bunch of BE gatling plasma wielding assassin sentinel wearing super heroes. That's much harder than searching for the damn camera. That automatically double gated. First maximum effort would have to be collect pvp gear that I don't want to be able to beat a mode I don't want to play to get an item I need to clear content that I do want to play. If they do this it will lock some players out of most if not all summer content.
---
yeah I dont see the engine being able to make the expierence enjoyable. A pvp game like that needs to run well and have good netcode and I dont really see those two in 76
---
so, is there a way to stay undetected?
---
I'm level 120 and I ran away from a level 3 today because he just wouldn't leave me alone about PvP.. 
---
Me n the missus killed each other just to get the kill 20 Players achievement. I hate PvP n just want to say I'm 1000% PvE!
---
&gt; The battle royale gamemode would only be good if done right.
---
Incidentally, this also applies to absolutely everything else in the world.
---
It could, just easier with more people. If you have the parts and plans, and it's just you wanting the workshop, I suggest just building 100 Power worth of generators to make fusion cores
---
Meh. This is when players should be allowed to destroy houses.
---
All the god stuff is sold on the trade sub or ebay etc ?
---
Yeah but why would those players move to 76? Those two games have way better performance and less lag all around. From outside it just looks like 76 is a laggy, unoptimized, terrible experience. But if they can somehow make it run well and not have any lag then hey good for Bethesda
---
It would be to easy to make alot of money if they let you sell ammo.
---
Are you playing on ps4? If yes, add me psn is same as reddit then I give you my hat. Perfect for a steam punk look with the mask :)
---
The thing is... in order for screenshots to be displayed in the game they have to be converted to a texture format the game engine will understand and do it 'on the fly'.
---
Then in order to load them is either enabling loading loose files - which the game currently doesn't do for obvious reasons - or 'injecting' them in a ba2 file, in either case while the game is running, which I am unsure if is currently capable of doing.
---
Which is why I said that is not possible, because I don't believe that without 'tacking on' the means to handle this to engine I do not think is currently capable of doing either of those things.
---
Feeling like a change is a good enough reason. I haven't played any BR since early PUBG and I'm not particularly interested, but damned if I'm going to get my knickers in a twist *before* I have all the information.
---
I deal mostly in 3 star legendaries with explosive or unique perks at reasonable prices. Business is always good but I spend a lot of time trading and travelling. I had a full stash of 3 star legendaries before trading started so this gave me a good start and rep. 
---
Right now I’m clearing out my stock as I only did it to level up my personal weapons stash.
---
Trading can be very good but if you want to make good caps it takes effort.
---
&gt;My friend is quitting 76 if it's a br. I keep telling him this and that they aren't removing the stuff you like, just play that.
---
I don't know your friend but that seems very short sighted and childish of him.  If they do some form of BR, and it looks like they are from the data mining,  how does that change anything for what or how they play and enjoy the game today? Especially when we know PVE is going to get some love too. I just don't get that sort of mentality and making broad dramatic statements about quitting, before we really know much about it, seems like the equivalence of throwing a tantrum and holding your breath until you get attention from the adults...even if that attention is negative. 
---
On top of that it looks like, at the very least,  you'll not get to swap between modes and you cannot bring existing weapons into it...in fact it seems like you'll have to start a new toon for it keeping the modes completely different...it's like getting a whole new game for free. 
---
Anyway,  even if your friend leaves,  you know there are plenty of folks in game that you won't need to play alone.  Cheers
---
Can you add me DragenRanger1
---
Different camps.
---
That's the thing. "Battle Royal" is not inherently bad, it's the amount of fanboy fuckery and over the top trash talk that's involved in some of the games that makes it suck. I personally *hate* PUBG and Fortnite with a passion, being a PvE player, but I also realize that just because I don't like it doesn't make it unarguable garbage, and adding it to 76 is not some reputation-ruining apocalyptic scenario, just like "no NPC's" and "multiplayer Fallout with PvP".
---
Each character has their own camp
---
Heavy assortment of bugs, stuttering and auto-aim Battle Royale.  What could go wrong?
---
What’s wrong with it (haven’t played in a while)
---
LOL, No fallout 76 player wants Battle Royal, and no Battle Royal player wants Fallout 76.
---
I just want Fallout 4, Minus Shaun, With Friends.
---
What I’d like is a non survival game mode where I don’t have to eat and food doesn’t expire. I’d pay like $5/mo for a private server my friend and I can play in with mods, but really until that is an option I’m not really interested in this game at all anymore.
---
All characters set up their own camps and camp locations.
---
What is your build with this weapon? Do you mind posting it?
---
[Locked doors](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bt86au/i_never_wanted_to_destroy_camps_until_the_8th/)
---
No worries, it happens.
---
It is bugged a bit. You have to start the quest by picking up holo tape and reading note in fort defiance. It will lead you to vault tec university and to divert power. You only have to do that once
---
True lmao
---
i doubt they will even put it together when you can have only 24 players on a server and even then it doesnt runs badly
---
I'm honestly holding out hope for a rogue light. I know it ain't gonna happen,  but damn it would be fun.
---
Yeah. He continues to say "ugh I have to leave just as I started to enjoy it" like what do you want me to say to that?!
---
Step 1: be free
---
Step 2: have good net code and mechanics.
---
Step 3: profit.
---
I don’t really see what FO76 has in common with either of those games, or Bethesda with the studios that made them.
---
I was referencing the character from Overwatch who wears power armor and uses a massive hammer. The comment above mine describes his ultimate attack.
---
I wish they would fix survival back to 200% caps. I made a killing, literally lol
---
Yeah, I’ve noticed a weird trend of massively underpriced Weapons/armor and massively overpriced junk/ammo
---
Really good idea, but it wold make melee even more overpowered. Maybe you need a perk card to do this?
---
Sniper build here. First thing to learn are abc's. Always Be Crouching.
---
These are events not quests and are open to everyone, so I'm thinking somebody else completed the event but you got the reward anyway.
---
What time? I will be on tonight... but can’t until then
---
Yeah, but it beats the behavior of other players. 
---
A lot of levels ago, I heard shooting and came upon a team of players getting attacked by several Yau Guai. Not knowing any better, I tried to help, was promptly killed, and ignored when I called for help. Not suprisingly, they took my loot too. 
---
Glad that he got a good story out of it.
---
Plans, lined underarmors (especially BoS/Marine), helmets (Marine/Tactical, Assaultron, Combat, Sentry Bot), and bulked junk.
---
dont worry abour it. if you take their bounty but dont grab their junk bag you are doing them a favor
---
I think the horde one someone else on the server probably joined the event too and killed the boss while you were in the other areas?
---
in player vending ballistic ammo should be sold in 5s by default
---
I got baited. For a second I thought they actually put in some challenge that isn't braindead. My mistake. Gotta go set my allarm to 7:05
---
Shan't even bother...
---
How do you feel about open front door but a player locked space?
---
I have the same issue, with a fucking foundation
---
My goodness, what an idea. Why didn’t I think of that.
---
On pc, Thank you for the offer though!
---
”Can you say Toxic Mutagenic Waste?”
---
While my knowledge of their game engine is limited, it's already possible to change the loading screens by swapping pictures. That to me suggests it is possible for their engine to use loose files.
---
Still doesn't change the fact the cost:value ratio for the feature is way off.
---
Isn't resistant the last one ?? That's the one the marine one has and big does 6 i found one yesterday but only puts it at 3 on each stat
---
Damn son, you got the back story down!
---
The real win of this story, they answered you :).
---
Hits dont register a considerable amount of time and vats usually doesn't work doesn't work if enemy is in the air.
---
&gt; He continues to say "ugh I have to leave just as I started to enjoy it" like what do you want me to say to that?!
---
Lol...well, it probably won't win you any friend points, but I'd go with  "grow up". 😂😂
---
It’s true. But he did still save me as opposed to letting me die.
---
Sounds like sever lag and delay of quests updates. It could be older quests finally completing also.
---
It's the civil war cylinder. That's it. Works perfect with the mask, look for it :)
---
We are doing it.
---
The 'loading screens' are handled differently. The only way I know - which it doesn't mean that it is the only way avaiable - to display an 'image' in game is to convert it to DDS and apply it to a mesh.
---
I do the following as I feel like for the day:
---
1) Craft Marine Wetsuit Headgear. Different requirements than the halloween costume, but it's what I got, same price value.
---
2) Healing salve: Run from Overseer's Camp all the way down through Flatwoods grabbing all the bloodleaf, come back up the side to grab Soot Petals, make Healing Salve for days.
---
3) Clear out junk. Check your stash. If you have more than 50 of anything but screws, you can sell or bulk-and-sell it.
---
4) Kill stuff. Be it ghouls at whitesprings or muties at west-tek or mole miners, killing creatures that drop gear is an easy method.
---
I thought we were getting something like that based on the trailers but we still don't have it
---
There are other places to go that are way underused. Try burrows and wes teck to atart.
---
Happy hunting fellow dweller.
---
Thanks man! I found the civil war reenactor a bit back, is the Chinese scientist from the intelligence base one as well? He apparently had a holotape about the base beneath mama dolces.
---
Tbh I would just run in like a bull in a china shop not seeing them, going about my merry way. Power armor ftw.
---
If they nerf melee this game will die. That’s all I gotta say, BSG is looking a lot like bungie cause they have no clue how to balance PvE &amp; PvP separately. If they nerf melee PvE will die off like how we lost a good amount of people when they nerfed TSE’s to dogshit, we’ll be level 200 taking 12 hits from a god roll legendary melee to kill a super mutant..... SOUNDS FUN!!!
---
I use the location The Big Maw it’s loaded with bones inside the base of the hole.
---
Horde one maybe, but not the forging a legend one.. the way it completed with 6 aliens was very wrong!
---
...both hahah
---
My thoughts exactly
---
Oddly enough they took that old prewar money... even though we know it's only good for if you have to go to the outhouse!
---
My best guess for nuclear winter is for it to be mode with harsher weather and each of the zones cranked up to be level 50+ Nothing new in terms of features, just another way of playing the same game like they did when survival was introduced. But we'll have to see when it's announced.
---
You can? never saw deathclaw skin
---
You need to be fatter.
---
I'm pretty sure I've found them. Either they're really rare, or I'm thinking of Fallout 4 😂
---
No idea, should work without perk tho in my opinion
---
You really don't do yourself any favors saying "p2w" when they said "cosmetic only." Not only are you giving people rope to attack you, but there's not really any question about whether they went back on their original statement.
---
I don't even have a roof
---
I wouldn't mind it ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Dropping in from high altitude in power armour for a big superhero landing would sick.
---
I'd love to see how a sneaky sneak build works. I can just imagine two Chameleons like back to back as the circle closes in just circling each other like "Wtf, where _IS_ he?"
---
I wonder how they'd do random looting or even if they would. Maybe you go in naked with your perks pre-selected or something and loot randomized gear on the way.
---
Would be even cooler if they left the NPC's in and it was kinda like PvPvE, it would give an option to get more loot at the risk of giving away your position. You could camp a legendary and wait for someone to try and take it for loot, then jump him and get the tactical advantage, catching him in the crossfire. Then just kill the now weakened legendary when you're done with him.
---
I want to upvote this but it's at 666 right now and I dont want to be the one to ruin that. Ill just say "good stuff" instead.
---
I sold 9000 rounds of .45 yesterday and made 400 caps. Feelsgoodman.
---
Oh really? Great! I haven’t been following the news very closely.
---
Kill 5 Scorchbeasts with a Syringer in a Radstorm or Nuke Zone while naked and intoxicated
---
Please no i can already see the challenges 
---
Catch 100 radfish
---
Catch 10 radshrimp
---
Catch the elusive radsomethingtodowithfish
---
Which has like a .0001% chance of even existing
---
Any extra plans are useless to me so I just put them up for 10c to try to help other players. The only ones I would not do that for are the super rare ones and even then probably no more than 250c but that's just me.
---
If you don't think repair kits are an early foot in the door for p2w then you're way way off base
---
Well since it's been duped to oblivion and back, probably the same amount as the others.
---
Hell I see the Marine Armor helmets go for 100 caps now.
---
I'll be honest. If they add survival elements to the mode (like having to drink/eat a lot, injuries not healing fast etc) and make it like a hunger game experience i would be really attracted to it.
---
[Here](https://imgur.com/T1Jk91a) is the only pic I have of it. If you go to the "main" entrance of the whitesprings, head to the right until you see railing that overlooks the golf course. If you keep heading up from there, you should see a little alley that leads to the parking lot next to the whitesprings bunker entrance. That alleyway has a few tables and benches; one of these benches spawns a wide variety of clothing items, including some rare ones
---
the worse thing is that it's easily fixable (there are some modding tools that let you fix this in 5mn) but, for some reason bethesda let things as is...
---
No disrespect to OP but this just sounds like getting a reward for going AFK
---
It's exactly what happens, yes
---
Ushanka and scribe hats fit it perfectly.
---
I've miss-bought a bundle and successfully got my atoms back not long after submitting a support ticket.
---
My quest says that I've visited 8/8 of the Robco stations, but quest doesn't go away and mark as completed.  It says visit the next tour stop (which there are not anymore)
---
So what kind of rewards would we get for an event in which you literally do nothing.. I imagine it’d be shit because I don’t want them handing good rewards out for people sitting in a room
---
He both got his loot and a lot of my spare loot as well!
---
Thanks! Didn’t know they added that! I’ll certainly take a look!
---
*at the expense of you starting up the power plant(takes 15 minutes) and you get 400 power
---
Oh shit, imagine table top simulator in a sim vault?
---
About 90% of the plans on my vending are 10-25caps. The queen drops like receivers are 500-1250 depending on what they are. I still reserve high priced items for market trades so that I don't accidentally lose caps to the cap max.
---
googling pay to win yields;
---
&gt;**Pay-to-win.** In some games, players who are willing to pay for special items or downloadable content may be able to gain an advantage over those playing for free who might otherwise need to spend time progressing in order to unlock said items.
---
The 'advantage' in this case being that someone who buys repair kits from the AS would not have to spend the time, effort and potentially ammo that fighting the SBQ or the ISQ takes.
---
While I concede that this is a minuscule advantage, it feels suspiciously like a slippery slope fallacy. Most others feel this way about the AS repair kits. As for who buys them, well, there's always a whale ready to unload cash because they're rich and don't care. I'd wager they've already made enough money of them for it to have been worth it, as is evidenced by what seems to be a refrigerator with the AS tag in datamined files.
---
Is there a way you can do this at the ammo plant
---
And now one that won’t complete! Haha mistress of mystery... the optional look for clues bit where your looking for the meeting place. Found the clue on the terminal but it won’t register. Switched servers, read it again but it still won’t complete. lol. 
---
I’m a massive fallout fan though, so I forgive it. :P
---
I was really worried because I've never done online stuff before 76, but I've been more than happy with things. I'd say at least 85-90% of my interactions have been pleasant. I'm a really sensitive guy, so dealing with assholes really gets me down, and aside from the first day of BETA, when I was getting teamed all day, things have been pretty good. I'm on PC, so I don't know if that's got something to do with it, but I hope things get better for you.
---
As for nuke zones, just be more assertive. You can only control what you do. I try to have my primary WS weapon be something a little underpowered so I can tag things and not take kills from people, thereby pissing them off. Waving people over for legendaries is great (I do it over mic), and I wouldn't stop that at all. If people want to be dicks, whatever. Stay true to yourself. The wasteland needs more goodfolk.
---
Awesome! I looked for a wiki but didn’t see one, they should make one and add this post to it very useful!
---
Thanks!
---
Some places get free power if the nearest power plant is powered up. Some of the farms have this but idk about the ammo plant
---
If they make 76 a battle royale, I'm done with it
---
I want the map to actually change and have snow everywhere
---
Rumor is all three need to survive
---
So just because of the hat? Other than that your character shares no resemblance to Chef Boyardee...
---
Often my sneak attack won’t stack with instigating and 40% power attack bonus. The first two will cancel out
---
Agreed
---
Go ahead and laugh - I buy 5mm at 1 c each. 
---
I don’t want to farm the mats, or am overweight as it is, or a whole bunch of other reasons other than I simply have the caps, and don’t want to bother making it myself. I also buy fusion cores and shotgun shells. 
---
You aren’t taking advantage of us. Not having to spend time farming for expendables, selling the expendables I DO have and gain naturally in my adventures, and using that money to buy what I need, when I need it is amazing.
---
Alekmor
---
Just think it needs to be updated at some point, theyre great songs but they get stale after some time
---
Just Wanna leave my note here, nuclear winter will be battle Royale, but it will have pve quests as well
---
What does that mean? If you put a lock on any door of any room, we have the potential to fast travel into it. I’ve spawned in players’ locked generator rooms, locked bedrooms, locked resource extractor rooms, locked bathrooms. lol.
---
It not shortsighted at all. Or childish. 
---
If they make a BR mode, its indicative that they literally do not care what the community wants. And that they will not spend dev time focusing on what players want, but will instead focus on what focus studies tell them will sell. (Nevermind those focus groups are wrong; BR markets are saturated, and no one is quitting Fortnite or Apex to play BR here, believe me. Literally fucking no one). 
---
FO76 is still a bug ridden, crash prone mess. It NEEDS fixes. Rebalances. And yet here they are, apparently contemplating a mode no one wants instead of focusing on what matters.
---
once in a while i will accidentally get a bounty picking a lock somewhere i didn't realize was owned. then i run around trying to find someone to take my bounty. or if they have a high bounty they deserve to be taken out because they are most likely griefing.
---
Starting another one now
---
God you guys suck. Battle Royale is fine game mode. Stop pissing yourselves. You guys complaining isn't gonna get it canceled. Pvp is part of this game whether you like it or not
---
Couple tips
---
Get at least one chameleon piece of gear. Reason is to improve survivability when ft to train station, if your crouched you will spawn invised and be able to get lay of land
---
If you need mods for it, let me know, and I'll craft them for you. I have the following: (stolen from  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/amtpyl/guide\_to\_excavator\_power\_armor\_mods\_and\_their/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/amtpyl/guide_to_excavator_power_armor_mods_and_their/) )  
---
**Optimized Bracers** (Arms) - *Reduces Action Point cost for power attacks*

**Motion Assist Servos** (Chest) - *Increases Strength by +2*
---
**Calibrated Shocks** (Legs) - *Increase Carry Weight by +50* ***(per leg)***
---
**Targeting HUD** (Helmet) - *Visor highlights living Targets*
---
Out of curiosity, what platform? It seems this happens on PC more than anything since a user's CAMP seems to load much quicker than on console. I typically spawn onto the first floor, outside, or partially in a foundation. Never spawned inside a locked room before.
---
I just want it to snow
---
As soon as baby calms down I’ll be on
---
Who cares what they think
---
We have this post every day...
---
There is absolutely nothing you can do to stop whatever it is. If nuclear winter is a battle royale, then they have already spent months working on it. They will not scrap it and start something new from scratch just because you don't like it. It was a horrendous decision if that's what they did, but apparently one of the old white guys up top decided this is what people want, so everybody below is ordered to work on it. And they are working on it. And they are not going to waste all of that work. Threads like this are absolutely pointless
---
2 would be solved by having dropped junk bags be locked to all but the player, and trying to pick it gives you a bounty!
---
Hey, I can actually confirm this. I tested moving the CAMP-device on to dry land rather than have it stowed away inside my house. And lo and behold, I no longer spawn in the lake by my camp, but rather on the ground.
---
Than you friend is dumb.
---
I think this guy accidentally picked an unfortunate lock as well. It was a bounty of 5c
---
Shield is the highest on all underarmor.
---
In a post-apocalyptic wasteland where everything is trying to kill you, you have to adjust...but you can't throw away your roots, either
---
I got an atoms refund on some christmas items I didn't want. They not only refunded my atoms but let me keep what i had accidentally purchased but told me the refund was a one time deal and that I wouldn't be able to do it again.
---
I’ve found two since the possum badge challenges started. One was in a world container and I think one was in a dung heap. Both were in the mire.
---
PlayStation. When I start to spawn I always try to run like hell because I know I’m probably going to get stuck.
---
Make a bunch of food and sell it before it goes bad 
---
Sell serums (fastest option)
---
Sell other stuff 
---
Make sure you have Hard Bargain equipped and pop a grape mentat before dealing for best prices 
---
(These are things my friends have helped me with, honestly I’m terrible at cap management as I have a bit of a camp plan spending habit) 😬
---
Yeah but that's chilling around with an entrance fee. And then you have that annoying cunt yelling at you to do something while you're trying to relax in the sun
---
Bethesda is weak on Melee.  Stand and Chop, chop, chop, no skill, no dodge, no dive, no evade..... block sucks.  Game is a first person shooter with weak shooting weapons, that don't respect head shots enough.
---
It is a shame that the melee weapons are by far the most powerful in the game ...... it forced me early into a melee build as between level 35-70, the lv 68 Supermutants, Scorched and lv 62 Charred Ghoul masses that you encounter are just too powerful for any gun you can legitimately have at those stages of the game, on a solo player build.
---
Being that Bethesda seems to want players to play melee ... they should do a lot of things to make melee better.  The melee on this game is straight out of the 1990's.
---
I got all the way to the wendigo cave. Then reset back to the blackwater mines. Not sure if that was where the glitch was.
---
It is both
---
West Tek/Whitesprings/Event runs and put any potentially useful Legendaries in your vendor. Best day for me so far is 7k caps, but there's people that rake in a lot more.
---
Only board game plans for your camp
---
But killing the sheepsquatch doesn’t mean anything to the event if all the cows die because of other mobs that nobody focuses on. That was my entire point.
---
Its not a simulation
---
I never thought of that. The fast travel system is buggy sometimes.
---
I’m pretty sure one of the vendors in whitespring sells it
---
There's definitely some but I bought it with more options in mind, you know?
---
I didn't buy it to use with just a few hats
---
Ya know, when I was in boy scouts I never had to dig through a massive pile of dung to get a merit badge.
---
Our character are insane.
---
Such a whiny post. You don't have to play pvp game modes, it's just there for people who do enjoy them. I'm sure wastelanders will bring a lot of new pve and main quest stuff.
---
Glowing meat steaks is a good one for me. Easy to come by.
---
Dammit well I hope they get to it I really wanna wear it just for when my armor breaks bam remove my outfit and I'm black opt out
---
This weekend, I spawned just outside a camp’s locked door to where the kiosks were. What’s the use of a vendor if people can’t reach it?
---
Yup
---
Yeah. I hear you. It looks so good. It should fit better with all headgear. I just tell myself the brown patch sticking through the bowler hat is an emblem or jewel of some kind.
---
That’s a decent roll
---
i think other people can disarm it and take the bones :/
---
A lot of your points are very valid.  We decided to get organized and do three by three teams and have got 3 out of 3 every time.  As for the spawn rates of room B and C it’s really crazy low sometimes.  Had it happen in A too once or twice.  It’s really fun if you can get organized, I won’t go down there without 9-10 people anymore, anything below that never works out.  And to anyone saying they solo this they’re totally lying cause it’s literally impossible 🤣🤣🤣
---
Yeah I’d say I get trapped either in a foundation or in a locked area 40 to 50 percent of the time.
---
Yeah, it was hellfire, at least in the English version of f3. I'm hoping inferno will be a responders power armor (great against scorched in some way) or a PvP focused one (great against explosions, etc).
---
Sucks to have to rely on people
---
Yep
---
Ill add you
---
Yup. The note in fort defiance is crucial. I had same problem last week. 
---
It can somehow be started without the note
---
As long as it's not *only* BR, I don't really care. I won't enter the arena even once, but I'm sure there are also players that will live there.
---
It’s an event designed for multiple people. And not all of us have one-shot builds.
---
Release the animal tames!!
---
Been doing this since new Vegas XD
---
Try and find out? I'm sure we are not the only ones curious about it.
---
Yeah.
---
There are many things in this game that could be fixed in 5 min but have been put off for weeks or months. The first few months of the game had a bug where you could get stuck inside a broken suit of power armor without any resistances/benefits and not be able to get out unless you drained the core to eject yourself. This was a bug carried over from fo4 that ALREADY HAD fan-made patches.
---
Stay well rested, eat cranberry relish/tasty squirrel stew, do events, do quests, murder everything you come across. Think that about covers it.
---
Appalachia could always use more ammo vendors.
---
Shotgun shells and 5.56 are always on my shopping list. I bought about 5000 caps worth yesterday.
---
I always have the feeling that PVP players are more temporary than the regular ones, since those sort of games seem to come and go every other week. I encountered two mini battles of players while shopping at players' camps last week. It's pretty weird to watch, especially when they respawn and return to the fray. It made me wonder if it could be interesting to be a warzone photographer in-game, but I only got one interesting snap off before I hit the photo limit and had to go to the menu to delete some.
---
I tried it for awhile but my brain can't see past it haha
---
I'll see if I can find a green hood or something and see how that looks
---
Well, better public opinion of the game mean more people will buy the game. That means Bethesda will get more money. That means Bethesda will focus more on the game. That means we will get more content.
---
Honestly I might consider dipping my toes into the battle royale genre if they do it. I haven’t played fortnite or any other BR because I don’t want to learn a whole new game just to get demolished every time I play, but if it’s with gameplay that I’m already very familiar with, I might give it a go even if I’m garbage at it.
---
Did u have to keep all 3 alive to get them all or can u get the backpack and bear claw with one friendly alive?
---
I dont.. I dont use mutie powers... that dont take away from the fact... sucks to rely on people... for whatever reason it may be.. i rely on people on the time, most of the time it sucks
---
I don't want to walk with my 5% hp overload af lvl 2 mule from the vault to the vendor if I'm sure it still works 😂
---
No way! I appreciate your input, didn't realize this was a thing.
---
Well, people with shotguns are usually too busy one-shotting the ghouls to cripple them. I'm not exactly sure what kind of build you're running but that's probably the only way to consistently cripple them and leave them alive for others
---
Even though you seem to think everyone was just given dupes, there is still quite a bit of effort involved. If there wasn't, you wouldn't be complaining.
---
Missed any opportunity to do that, but it seems to be cured post-patch.  I tried all sorts of things - putting one or both in inventory etc but nothing worked. The only way to tell them apart was to favourite one and not the other. That didn't copy across.  Fixer is still level 20, unfortunately.
---
Oh. I thought you were calling me bad at the game or something. Oops.
---
Anecdotal
---
Try Fo3..
---
If it’s two or three star the other perks will stack, but I haven’t see any added benefit to having multiple chameleon equipped. So what exactly will stacking chameleon do? I only have four pieces equipped both arms and legs are chameleon.
---
Yeah, my mule has gotten some ok peices at lvl2
---
have you gone to the asylum and did whatever on the computer there first ...the original quest sent you there then you would go to the university but they changed it recently but i still think you have to go to the asylum at least once and mess with those computers
---
No problem... that's why I explained further..
---
Yes. Give me more camp space and a buildable robot butler to guard the place, fix broken/damaged stuff, and close doors.
---
Ok
---
I've seen it for sale at multiple train stations, it's only two caps.
---
The green hood looks really good with it. My problem there is finding an outfit that matched the hood. But good luck!
---
I don't think that at all.
---
My complaint is why should wanting to achieve the meta or a good build rely on luck to achieve? Why should only a handful of players get to reach that meta because they got lucky to either get a god roll or find someone selling what they want.
---
What's wrong with a system to earn the gear you want. Earning it doesn't have to be easy or cheap.
---
I'm asking for work vs luck.
---
I’m just going to say the following:
---
Thank you so much for helping me out, I can’t believe how much time you spent writing this amazing post. You don’t know how much you helped me, not only understand most of the game mechanics but know the advantages and disadvantages of perks and pieces of armor. 
---
Back to the discussion:
---
I don’t know much about the game but based on what you’re saying; it makes sense on why you completely removed the sneak perks and put the agility points to something else. I saw that you left 2 points in agility (a mistake I suppose), I put 1 more point in adrenaline and 1 other point in marathoner. 
---
To the armor and defense; I kinda understand why you’re going main on bolstering and not on unyielding, but is there an alternative to the defense as I like having more carry weight with the unyielding pieces of armor. Also, should I wear Power Armor in nuke zones (especially SBQ fights) and swap out marathoner with something Power Armor related?
---
Talk about heroes who don’t have to wear capes :)
---
Players can hear me but i cant hear them
---
I want nuclear winter to be the beginning of real stakes NPC quests, and large scale raid party raid events.
---
Also, mirror the PvP in ESO. Weekly and monthly seasons, huge new PvP map, faction battles that rage 24/7
---
So if I lover the prices too much I fuck up somethig?
---
You're implying I don't already have them from mole rats burrowing through space and time
---
Spent $100 total on 4 separate copies of the game (3 of those were for friends to play), $50 in the atom shop just to support the game, 900hrs in. Yes, get it, it’s pretty fun
---
Oh I know. Just saying both are important.
---
It seems to be a 50/50 chance to get max level items on a low level character. On my new character (lvl8) last night I got a max lvl Vanguard cavalier piece followed by a lvl 1 piece.
---
The problem is that with each patches, old bugs that have been patched in the past come back, new things breaks. It's really annoying but, without that, the game would be awesome
---
I’m just saying that if the brahmin are being mobbed by stingwings and bloatflys I would appreciate some help lest you want to fail the event
---
I been working on my new trap.. a farm.. with a catapult into a room with unlockable doors and Tesla and plasma traps behind them
---
In a radstorm
---
Would the double damage be more advantageous on armored enemies anyways, just from a numbers perspective? Or is AA actually pretty effective on a shotty?
---
Might work if they had some UV style lights. Suppose you could use lightboxes, but those would still look a bit odd.
---
I feel late to the game, what are Deathclaw hides needed for?
---
&gt;If they make a BR mode, its indicative that they literally do not care what the community wants. And that they will not spend dev time focusing on what players want,
---
The biggest problem with this statement is that it fails to recognize how software is developed...and how they are able to produce a roadmap to begin with.  They've architected and started developing this mode, almost certainly, before FO76 was even released.  
---
The other major problem is that you seem to think that if Bethesda doesn't listen to you and/or the small percentage of players that use Reddit, that  they don't care what their customers want.  Yet, demonstrably, they do care and listen as is evidenced by the changes and fixes that have been put into place already.  That's a whole lot different than ripping out a feature of the game that they've had on the board and developed for months before release if not years. 
---
People need to chill out and wait to see what this mode brings...and what it means, if anything,  for PVE
---
Thanks for that snipped of advice, just got one from somewhere will try this out :D
---
I've met some really nice people on Xbox, and also a lot of assholes who will do that kind of stuff. White springs does seem to bring out the bad people 😕
---
BOS hood fits nicely with it
---
I found a laser pistol and used it to kill a firefly and that counted it for me.
---
Its not their job to check all your comments to see if you corrected your mistake elsewhere. If you make a mistake and you want to correct it do so in the place you made the mistake. Dont get mad at someone pointing out that you are wrong. What do you expect? People to search your entire reddit history to make sure you never wrote any other comments on the topic first?
---
Don’t melee crit attacks already 1 shot everything?
---
I would like some alphaghetti with the original meatballs that actually tasted good.
---
I'm on Xbox too. White springs is a bad place to go if you're trying to meet good people 😂
---
I hope that is how the do this battle royal mode.. a simulation with no legendary and base lvl guns..
---
It just happened to me too. It's happening for adventure and survival and new character so I assume it's something on Bethesdas end.
---
“I seen’t whatchu did” ~ Mothman
---
Nice! She gave me a two shot exploding black powder pistol with faster reload the other day!
---
For one of the pioneer possom challenges you have to collect 5 deathclaw hides.
---
Nope if you use the knuckles or anything with bonus damage when charged attacks happen.
---
Yeah I’ve been hopping, guess it’s just bad luck
---
&gt; Not to mention they were like 50 meters ahead of the road 
---
There are mobs that spawn in the raider thing on the road, and at the farm itself. I run ahead to clear the mobs to protect the cows, it's to help keep the cows health as full as possible. (When it's clear, or there's going to be the wolves/bugs/bear spawning on the cows I go back to the cows.) Maybe I misunderstand what you're saying.
---
50 meters is 54.68 yards
---
Not gonna lie the elevator entrance should give an extra warning. Like this event is for those level 50+ are you sure you want to enter?  I know it gives the warning at the button but my dumb low level self doesn’t always read when I assume it’s just gonna say up. I pressed it and I guess fortunately my game crashed.
---
The problem is that not a single person stayed behind to help me defend the cows if mobs decided to rush out before that
---
Yes, I am all about PvE, quests, story, events, crafting, CAMP, etc. The last damn thing this game needs is fucking battle royale.
---
Try watogastation or brotherhood vender
---
nothing affects your legendary drops except your "Real world luck"
---
Yeah that’d be nice
---
Yep, nerf melee please!
---
ok, yeah if they're not protecting the cows that's not good :)
---
What’s it called signs and letters ?
---
Sorry, I liked it too much and had to have it :3
---
They best come in with a hell of a lot of contrition for how badly the launch was handled.
---
I enjoy PvP. You don't speak for everyone.
---
Understandable!
---
I ran around yesterday naked with a label 5 bowie knife with a bounty of 10 because I accidentally picked a lock, trying to get someone to kill me lol. Noone has area chat on anymore! I ended up with a group of like 5 players emoting at me as I hit them with my little knife. Not what I was going for but it was fun lol. 
---
Ended up hopping in survival and just running at everyone, I did put my gear back on and actually fight. Ended up number one on the server with 10 kills. Was actually a fun experience in survival for my first time.
---
While wearing pajamas
---
I expect someone to follow the conversation, before taking part in it. Others have already pointed out that it's a bug that came with the latest update, so there is no need for another correction. Acting like a smartass is pointless. I mean seriously, all he had to do was to look at 1 comment under mine, and he would have seen it.
---
if melee could consistantly hit 1 target I would be happy too.... :/
---
It does... and some of the songs like “Answer to driving nails in your coffin” aren’t on Apple Music (which I use)
---
Truly the best
---
Yes it should be called signs and letters
---
Ah okay thank you. I kind of skipped the challenges and farmed the camp tales event lol
---
I'm very sorry to have offended you!
---
even if they do have pvp they better remove legendary gear, god knows ppl with god tier builds will dominate
---
Ya, I made an evil character named "Nancy Hitler" and Codsworth might have been saying Nancy, but I'de swear he kept calling me Mr.Nazi.
---
I still dont know what TSE stands for and I've been playing since the B.E.T.A.
---
Where have you been? Under a rock? All joking aside, that is a pretty big thing to miss.
---
How would you feel if you came across my camp that has 30 misc/junk items listed for 25000 each?
---
Its “the 9”.......They tried to manifest themselves into our reality and, well, bad data...
---
See, they used to be “the 10” but this happened...
---
Deep lore, obscure, you probably wouldnt get it...
---
r/ihadastroke
---
Just wanted to confirm that you can get the bear arm plan for this mission and not just the bear arm itself, I've seen everything else so far except for the bear arm plan.
---
It really doesn't matter if it's 5 fields or 100 fields. It's still nothing computationally.
---
it's also alooot of caps.  2000ish I think?  Some will correct me.
---
I don't mind if they make battle royale as long as it's another mode or event, there *are* people out there who want it I'm sure, I only ask that those of us who prefer PvE get a little something in the DLC as well.
---
Not sure why everyone thinks the incoherently intoxicated robobrain would make a good D.J. the novelty would quickly wear into just annoying and hard to understand.
---
I come across players like that once in a while. It’s really helpful and builds up the community and the joy of gaming as you mentioned. Thumbs up for sharing and giving out good vibes.
---
If combat wasn't so wacky with all the different builds and legendary effects, PVP could be fun. I just don't see it ever becoming a competitive PVP environment the way the game is. So at this point I have no interest in PVP.
---
PVP really needs a level playing field, where everyone has close to the same HP, and weapon types consistently do a certain amount of damage, like all good PVP shooters attempt to do. Then you can develop tactics around it and it's fun.
---
But with open PVP you also miss out on a lot of the cool player interactions you get in this game when you don't have to be so distrustful of every other player. It's true that this is a post apocalyptic world and it would be a little like that in many places, but also because it's a game and there is no permanent death, there is no fear of the consequence of death/dismemberment which actually would create pockets of justice like in the wild west.
---
The person that datamined it is credible enough imo. He hasnt given out inaccurate information sofar, so its correct i'd say. He double checked aswell to make sure.
---
Picture of player in spacesuit fighting an alien.. GTFO... in 900hrs I've seen The flatwoods monster once and it immediately teleported.
---
So, not hating but wanted to add comment.
---
regardless of what you and others think about large group events, bethesda it seems doesn't agree.
---
As  each new DLC or content is added, the level of complexity and cooperation from people continues to grow.
---
so, i don't think this is going to change. if anything it will continue to expand and grow. bethesda is constantly asked to deliver new ingame content, WHAT and HOW is defined by them but value is still on us.
---
i know this is a game, but if you've ever worked with or in large companies and organizations this is classic change management work content. 
---
the goals are identified, and codified. identify your stakeholders, AND change agents, communicate the value and benefit of achieving the goals, have defined roles and responsibilities, get support and buyin from everyone.
---
TL;DR, put simply, lower  your expectations or change the way you work.
---
fwiw, fallout franchise has historically been solo experience, if you want to really enjoy the game you're gonna have to embrace their mindset.
---
Level 99 here and I do the same thing!
---
It's the attitude of the players who do this, they 'could care less' about other players not in their team, they are running the Whitespring circuit for gaining xp and farming legendaries, this is on adventure mode so you/we are irrelevant to them. They are killing as quickly as possible in a tunnel vision mode for maximum profit.
---
I hate the explosive one shot kill players, but there is nothing I can do about it, with the legendary vendor, Whitesping is full of farming teams, I just avoid.
---
Deathclaw Armor !!🤔
---
Or better yet, have weight perks automatically apply to your stash, even if you don't have them equipped!
---
I found keeping a secure rooms on 2nd floor and above prevents people from getting stuck when fast traveling to camp. The only room I lock is the generator room.
---
Well that makes zero sense but it’s bgs so
---
About 100caps most of them. Some like just tablets or cabinets I put at 80, whereas rarer ones like the barn building sets maybe around 300. Plans like the tesla rifle and lever action I put at about 1000. Good pieces of armor like BOS combat armor around 250-300 a piece. 
---
If you go by what most people on here say then you may as well run a charity shop. If you price stuff higher it will sell (provided you're not being ridiculous), but you have to be a little patient. There's more than a few people out there with lots of spare caps and nothing to spend them on.
---
It’s 9k. Saw it last night not trying to buy it from a vendor
---
He could have put that LMG on the market, and probably the railways and made 10k+ each...
---
Two-Shot Explosive legendary weapons
---
Speaking of challenges, what counts as stormy weather? I still can’t get the survival challenge for this week done.
---
to clarify:
---
i killed 40+ deathclaws before a datamining friend confirmed that deathclaw hides do not drop from deathclaws.
---
Two Shot Explosive
---
Quad Explosive Harpoon Guns are unbelievably fun if you've got 15k or damn good luck. I'd recommend the Flechette mod as well.
---
Prices get more reasonable as you get away from WS. But people who set up CAMP there typically either don't know how to price things or think that people are desperate enough to buy at those prices. My CAMP is at WS (because I wanted to build a massive chess set) but my  main shop is on an alt near PV station. This was a strategic move because CAMPs there generally have reasonably priced stuff that's worth looking at. So I like to be close to other people who sell at reasonable rates. :P
---
I don't know. Melee is pretty good as it is.
---
Treasure maps and bobbleheads seem to sell fast for me. Bobbleheads never stay more then a day in my machines.
---
Backup weapon I'd say Vampire's Buzzblade with Electrified mod. You won't need ammo and it heals you faster than most things can harm you.
---
The servers seemed to be really shitting themselves earlier so maybe they finally crumbled
---
You are most welcome! I'm glad to share my experience!
---
First off, all choices are ultimately yours. There is an up-side and a down-side to all of them in this game and choosing the ones you want are ultimately the right ones. The game allows a large degree of flexibility (you don't need any perk cards to "complete" everything in the game - I used quotes because technically there is no end it's a true sandbox).
---
If you read my entire post you will see why the 2 points were left out of agility. It was intentional so I could discuss your options in a different section.
---
IMO Adrenaline is not ever worth more than one rank. Beyond rank one has severe diminishing returns and there are much better choices that would benefit you more (even if it is just one point). Marathoner is a very good choice for your build as you will see when you read that section of my original post.
---
I didn't have enough space to post all the reasons to use different combinations of bolstering and unyielding. Ultimately, the choice is yours. The trade off is stats versus defense so you just have to play and see what works for you. I just wanted you to know that my setup already has more than enough damage to give you an idea of how flexible you can be with your choices.
---
If you are solo then yes you will need either power armor or a hazmat suit for nuke zones. If you have an organized group neither are needed but you will need to be supported by your teammates (specifically, Chr/Rad Sponge and you may even need to swap in End/Ghoulish). For nuke zones outside of fighting the SBQ I recommend you not bother running at low health (just use radaway to remove the radiation that otherwise keeps your health at whatever threshold you desire). Fighting the SBQ with a bloodied build and not dying is a little more tricky but easy with a little experience. It helps that she dies very quickly if you have more than one person running a similar build. If you lack the bolstering equipment or leaded mods fighting the SBQ can become significantly more hectic if you aren't used to it. You also will die to the occasional strong hit (hence the recommendation for such high defense) that you otherwise would take very little damage from. Keep in mind that the build that I use is not the same as the one I gave you! I swap in different cards whether I am in an organized party/pug party/solo but for example here is the solo/non-nuke zone build that I've been running around with (still testing btw):  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3b457b&amp;d=sg2se2ss2s41sm1sn1pe2eu0eh2i44a72au2lu2l71lt2la2ee2ei2c71cm0a10&amp;w=&amp;n=Toazd%202HBM%20testing&amp;m=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3b457b&amp;d=sg2se2ss2s41sm1sn1pe2eu0eh2i44a72au2lu2l71lt2la2ee2ei2c71cm0a10&amp;w=&amp;n=Toazd%202HBM%20testing&amp;m=). When in an organized group (that provides rad sponge) I swap the Charisma cards to Suppressor rank 3 and Strange in numbers rank 1 and for Agi/Dodgy I swap in Adrenaline rank 1.
---
You are too kind thank you! Have fun!!
---
$$$ bottom line, it's a business, try everything and everything to milk the punter of their money.
---
Literally the most popular weapons the first 3-4 months of the game, and still a pretty popular item. 
---
How's life under that rock?
---
They just released pvm stuff in fact the majority of content is pvm related stop acting like there only focusing on pvp stuff when they haven’t.
---
Also speak for yourself you don’t know what others want or like so stop speaking like you do.
---
Ohhhh 🤔
---
i remember them being a rare junk item even in fallout 4. i have 5 so far from searching yellow crates,green lockers and junk piles. its kinda fun finding one and displaying it as a trophy in your camp.
---
The space suit helmet is a gas mask though I thought.
---
I ran across that same issue and looked up the bug. Read the note with the terminal password for mission 99 fixes it.
---
Yeah, it is dumb expensive
---
lolz lmao. it's NOT like that Deuce movie. at all
---
upvoting anyway.
---
&gt;however you may still complete other world Challenges to earn badges.
---
I’m just trying to get the back pack but it’s seem unnecessarily difficult. How can I revive a teammate while playing solo? Royal Jelly? Took me over a week and multiple server jumps to acquire 3 to make that one recipe. Seems the only useable one spawns in a single location. Stuck on 2/4 scout values. Can’t trigger 2 of them. Taking photos of bugs/animals doesn’t always register. I wind up wasting a lot of film. Then I have to be mindful of the photo limit.will any of these issues be addressed? Thanks.
---
A Fallout 3/Fallout: New Vegas double feature remaster would be my dream. And throw in Oblivion remaster to make it even more unlikely. :{
---
Melee, then? Could be worth a try.
---
It's broken, lots of posts about it, don't bother until it is fixed.
---
This lvl 5 player destroyed my 3 story mansion once, spent a quarter of my caps repairing it. Thanks to him, I decided to upgrade to a 5 story fortress.
---
If your doing a heavy weapons build then you’ll max out in strength. This doubles as a melee build backup. Running heavy weapons means you will need constant ammo. So claiming the ammo factory weekly will be a must. 
---
Regardless, your primary weapon should be a legendary. so don’t discard a powerful weapon along the way. there may be a time your using a  shotgun till you get a decent Gatling gun.
---
Or a super mutant with a minigun should drop a minigun instead of a pipe pistol.
---
And the last state of Campfire Tales. If it's the horde, the fire is going to go out before you kill all 3 waves.  Focus on getting kindling first.
---
What event?
---
You can only enter the shutdown code during phase 1, before you have your friendlies.
---
Definitely too late now why did you wait so long?
---
And drunk.
---
I didn't even think they'd refund it, to be honest. I learned to be a lot more careful in the Atom shop because of it, anyways!
---
Thanks! And I’ll look out and for similarities to fit me. Again, thank you!
---
Repair kits are hardly pay to win for end game. Maybe if you really suck at the game or your a new player they’d be useful. Just another small thing  for people to blow way out of proportion.
---
I haven’t been in a single pve or pvp situation where I thought damn they got me cause of that repair kit, and honestly don’t think you have either. In the case of pve I’m not sure why you wouldn’t want them. Hell my weapons barely break in the first place. 
---
I’ve got like 15 of them right now I forget about and I don’t even do the SBQ religiously. Just when I see a decent group working at it. 
---
To me it seems more like a way for Bethesda to get you to dump some precious free atoms away so you have to pay for the real content. (Camp items, skins, etc.) because people thought they were gonna be a factor and bought them up.
---
They want Squatch loot then, is that all they want, the event reward is meh?
---
SMG is not a heavy weapon bro, maybe you’re thinking LMG? But all heavy weapons are hugely fun. I’ve played shotgun rifle and also melee a little, nothing beats the fun of heavy weapons. Melee is way op and will likely stay that way, but what’s so interesting when all you see blurry pixels and hollow geometry and all you do is spamming one button. 
---
Ammo is no biggie, Lucky hole mine for lead, black waters mine for steel and acid is everywhere. I use miniguns primarily now, super mutants drop a lot of 5mm, sometimes 500 rounds.
---
It is very much short sited and childish as Bethesda has been listening has been fixing bugs daily and has been doing what players want so I don’t know what your taking about if you want to quit the game over a game mode you can ignore go ahead I think it’s insanity stupid but go ahead go have fun with anthem I’m sure they will listen to you more
---
i really hope we not gonna get a battle royale or another pvp mode since the only viable strategy is 1 shot kill double shot explosive vats...
---
Especially because they blanket nerfed explosives. Classic "well suros is OP so let's nerf every assault rifle into the dirt for 2 yesrs."
---
For real though like did anyone complain about m79's and missile launchers? No. But they still got a hefty nerf.
---
It might be the only way to acquire it, never seen this plan drop in the wild.
---
But they could, by taking a second to shoot at some mobs other than the sheepsquatch, receive both the event and squatch rewards instead of just the latter. I seriously don’t understand why it’s so hard for them to grasp that concept.
---
I run it better solo than with teams.  Explosive shotgun kills the mobs.  Switch to DCG for the Squatch.
---
I feel like your complaining? But 2 out of 3 times it's not a terrible ratio for success. Better than mine anyway.
---
Why are you here?
---
i gave up on things making sense when i realized the tooltip was broken since launch and didnt display numbers properly on any item with two-shot/multiple projectiles and an explosive roll.
---
Ok, I’ll bite. Why only the generator?
---
I just listen to my fo76 playlist on spotify on Xbox, while I'm playing.
---
I'd kinda like an alternate ammo receiver, I'm having a hard time finding enough .308 to feed this hungry little gun lol.
---
Film is a nice gift. If you need a camera, loot the containers around the overseers camp.
---
Never thought of that... I figured they had multiple machines so multiple people could buy at once.  Didn't know that each machine would have different things.  That seems rather stupid way to implement vending machines.
---
That wendigo... had to kill it twice, I had the exact same issue :/
---
I just rolled the dice with my level 15 alt, one server would give me level 15, another will give me max level, no guarantee so you may want to try low star items first to minimize loss.
---
Or what about the cool turrets I've only seen by West tek super mutants. They have shopping cart frame that turns.
---
How cool is that? Did they even exists in F4?
---
If you look, it usually starts at 2/5 or 3/5. I think it carried over any extra from the previous times.
---
Pretty sure that’s wrong info. I thought it was 5% up to an increase of 30% or 35% 
---
Reason was we were trying to figure out if a TSE was better or not that FE
---
Last night I didn't see it being done on any servers I was on in a long play session.  Maybe because failure rate is around 60%, the drops are terrible...one-stars from the end boss, a Super Stimpack recipe from a successful completion...really?!, I did manage to get Formula P, no Diffuser, a couple of lab coats.
---
So another consumable and more outfits.
---
The problem isn't necessarily just the RNG in this game.  It is that Bethesda hasn't figured out the time/effort/risk vs. rewards system that every other game has done before.
---
In all fairness there’s not much in the way of chef clothes.  Not even a damn apron!  Maybe amusement park worker clothes.
---
At no point have I ever thought oh Christ all of these guns are broken and I can’t find like 7 screws to get them fixed. It is a nonissue you people latched onto with these damn repair kits. The purchasable kits are honestly a stupid buy and you’re stupid if you buy them and the better ones still aren’t needed. They provide no advantage what so every in anyway other saving 5 seconds of your time when you pass a bench for the 10th time that hour. They are convenience items. Nothing more.
---
It worked for Fasnacht. Sounds good!
---
I can't tell if this is satire or not
---
having a small fragment of hope that one day the game will be good
---
So they capped a server at 24 people and are making raids that need 30-50% of the people to want to do that same thing at the same time in order to be successful.
---
Thats almost impossible to do IRL let alone in a game.
---
Why cant someone do this on ps4. I love code cracking
---
get twisted muscles mutation
---
get a full unyielding set.   
---
nerd rage is a must with melee
---
radicool will get you more str as well.
---
Yep, or decimal pricing for prices below 2c.
---
I think a battle royal type game-mode would really help late game players as it would add a actually hard aspect for people who have done everything 
---
But yea mabye not for nuclear winter update (the summer update) it would probably be better as a smaller but still big one like the pioneer scouts.
---
Playing a heavy build atm. Im not the most experienced at it yet but its a rough early game. Cant use or make heavies till lvl 35 nor get the damage perks for it til then. I used a sniper and a shotgun up until 35. Ive used all lead for 5mm rounds and stoxkpiled it (had about 15k+ ammo by 35) Search player vendors for plans. Got gatlin gun plan for 250 caps which to me is super low. (Idk prices)
---
O really? Is it a mechanic thats broken or is it just too OP?
---
Lmao you can repair your guns mid fight with the free and more powerful version. Honestly if you took your nearly broken gun in to fight the queen without any other gun you’re the dense one and I’m being very polite by saying only that.
---
Make it a drinking contest at a bar event, and add more alcohol effects to drinking more than 1 drink. Characters sway with visual and audio distortions.
---
This is not true. You can move it around to change spawn points just like you suggested. I do it regularly when changing my camp around in the same spot. 
---
Sometimes I spawn them on the back porch.. Sometimes they get the dungeon..
---
Also, plans for plasma grenades need to actually drop form any event.
---
Do you know of anyway to get rid of them?
---
I ignore all of these as before. 
---
I had a heck of difficulty finding out about "world challenges" needed for the packpack, as Im so unfamiliar with checking the challenges.
---
I do try to get some easy 20 atoms from weekly though but most of the time I can't even do any dailies even though I play a lot.
---
Play every musical instrument in the game and wait for Bethesda to fix the glitch that will allow you to be acknowledged ..... 10 Atoms.
---
&gt; They show up under misc I think
---
Oh wait a minute for all I know I had it in my inventory all along.
---
Going to check tonight for sure. Thanks.
---
Or how about a ranged weapon perk that can shoot through more than one enemy?
---
Explain the advantage provided. Please.
---
This.
---
That’s another thing that players can do as well
---
I have had the same problem when I face annoying stingwings trying to use my only viable weapon All Rise.
---
I started that event last night, I'm pretty sure I triggered it and suddenly there were like 10 level 100s surrounding me and I kept getting killed every 5 seconds and ended up being a medic to everyone way higher level than me, then the game got stuck on a respawn menu and I had to leave so I didn't get anything out of it but... hopefully they did.
---
They need to make xp and loot sharing in a team a thing at least. At the moment you have an online game with no real incentive to group up or build any role other than high damage.
---
Highly subjective of what is good what are you looking for? It’s good now imo I’d play this over anthem or red dead online any day of the week
---
I’ve heard 5% up to 50% max. Wouldn’t it be great if the effect description just fucking said 😃
---
Most fallout players are. They tried to please too many people, spread too thin 
---
I only wonder if this whole game was some long shot gambit to promote the next single player fallout and to remind us how lucky we are
---
It’s all,random, got the backpack on the 1st success and formula p recipe on the 2nd successful attempt
---
Were you just spamming the a button?
---
This is 100% not true at all. I’ve done it multiple times as well as the groups I play with.
---
meaningful pve content ,raids and dungeons ala wow ,gear progression that is from raids and dungeons not grinding legendaries
---
Clearly you don’t know how game developement works
---
How much do you charge for a fully charged core?
---
Punctuation would help your argument more.
---
love #2, ‘getting loot requires a hit’, it’s just so unfair. They should really just give everyone loot whenever something dies on that server, no matter where you are, so nobody will feel left out. Especially for boss fights, as long as you’re on that server you provided moral support and deserve a share 👌
---
Yes!  You can’t do a power attack in VATS now and this would be an amazing way to add it!
---
More than agree! I would be strongly dissapointed if new mode would be pvp strictly. Such a shame.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if this "feature" was already in the works or at least on the drawing board. The question is, which is more simple to implement: fractional caps cost or adding more bulk recipe records that cannot be sold at a vendor? First, they need to fix and make sure the vendors work as intended so it might be a little while before this could appear on our radar.
---
Nuka Granade, the Nuka Quantum granade should be better but its glitched
---
Haha nah, I recently had a controller crap out on me so I'm using an older one for now...for some reason sometimes it likes to double click "a" and right on the d-pad.
---
I don't know. The interface is already so complicated, and how same key does different things depending on what portion of screen is highlighted. If they add more keys it just becomes worse.
---
Thanks man. I must admit I was a negative Nancy when this game first come out, but actually giving time to adjust I can't keep away from it!
---
I just bought a 2 shot Expl. Gatling plasma last night at a crazy price thanks to player vending. So no, You can find amazing deals just server hopping for camps.
---
\&gt; if they nerf melee this game will die
---
lol, no it won't
---
Please.  It is something that needs to be changed. I have only found one in a box since the possum challenges started.
---
15% damage for 10% less fire rate is not balanced especially considering how armor plays into damage. Nobody would or *should* use the regular one at that point
---
&gt;Honestly I might consider dipping my toes into the battle royale genre if they do it.
---
Exactly the same for me! I've not played any online games let alone multiplayer until FO76, but like you, I understand the mechanics so I at least will have a fighting chance,  no pun intended! 😂
---
Sounds like fallout 4 with mods.
---
Yup! I’ll be on most of the day too
---
But I’m on Xbox and can’t do that... also I don’t have fallout 4
---
Look at the Impulse grenade. Insane dmg
---
If thats the case I'm glad those people left, the game could do with less TSE duped players dominating pvp.
---
Is this really one of the daily challenges? I’ve seen the Flatwoods monster three times but two out of three he left when I wasn’t even close but he heard me. You have to get so close with the camera even with the zoom!
---
How does someone think they are catering more to pvp? How in the hell?
---
I only found him once but he was hostile(red eyes) and my freind and I were running to the civil war reenactment. I was telling him to stop but he would not stop
---
I’m on Xbox too and I have mods on fallout 4.
---
How!?
---
Any value to growing the ingredients for booze and crafting that?
---
Why does everyone think Todd decides everything? If anything he is just a spokesman at this point? What exactly does he work on? I think there are pole much higher then Todd that decides what goes on with fallout 76 imo
---
We all have duped gear
---
 Bethesda open support for mods on Xbox and PlayStation. Years ago. Same with Skyrim.
---
So what if it is?
---
Does not need to be this is not fallout 5 stop acting like it is get over it and accept fallout 76 for what it is
---
Sure why not
---
I've gotten TWO from the junk hole across from the train station near TOTWrld
---
Huh. Neat. Maybe I’ll try to get Fallout4 then.
---
Too much of the same item gets you banned. We all have duped gear. Probably everything I've bought or traded is most likely duped. Unless you picked it up yourself, it's probably duped
---
allso the same thing for canadien french version
---
I'm amazed by how friendly most of the people in this game are. 
---
I started playing recently and I'm currently lvl 29. Lots of players use the "follow me" emote and drop stuff for me, be it weapons, stimpacks or whatever they think I may need. It's just so amazing.
---
Yesterday I got cornered by a legendary Sheepsquatch inside of a player's CAMP. I messaged him asking if he could come and help me and he came right away in his power armor to help me get rid of the thing. I think it's these small things that make this game great.
---
I used to use MIRV grenades when doing silo runs.  If you have a tank to occupy them, I was able to one-shot assaultrons consistently.
---
I don’t understand why people need to lock the door. Just makes it even more of a mission to get inside to have a look. Some camps are amazing and don’t understand why they wouldn’t want people looking.
---
Its funny I was thinking that last night while in a Queen run. All these mobs I was being swarmed by and I was thinking "you know it would be nice if the swing of my fist weapon HIT everything that is standing in the the middle of my swing's arc."
---
They’re under Misc and u can drop them
---
Any reason folks don't set up around Vault 76?  Travel would be free so there'd be more caps to spend. I normally route through 76 to lower the cost of travel when I can. I would definitely check sales before traveling to my destination.  
---
* If this is already a thing on PS4 or PC then disregard. I  haven't seen it on XB1 yet.
---
That's because you aren't a metagamer / cheater and did not get involved with the people who cheated and duplicated the most OP weapons in the game to sell for IRL cash.
---
No need for recipes it can work like bulking junk.
---
I have 1080 @ the moment. I've bought $20 worth twice in the past.
---
This game doesn't need more PvP, I hate what it has now. It's obnoxious. We don't need another mode.
---
I still use the auto 40 mm on a regular basis. It's great at killing.
---
wait, so I have to spend more Atoms to get a different variant of the skin I already got? :l or is it a different customization
---
It **worked**. Thanks man!
---
I may like a battle royal mode if it was done right.. im thinkin everyone dropping in at one biome only, (the ash heap and toxic valley is perfect) w/ obvious weapon/armor drops and a few modifications or aid scattered.
---
These locations would be perfect but creating a perfect balance might be immoossible for em.
---
This mode could move akot of assholes away from adventure/survival modes! Just a idea, I still probably wont play it..
---
Pokémon Snap: The Wasteland Expansion
---
While I did laugh at this clever idea I cringed when I saw the picture of your character. I believe you can do better! For reference, here is the legend himself [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ettore\_Boiardi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ettore_Boiardi)!
---
Absolutely. My first character had 9 charisma for sharing level 3 perk cards, and had lots of medic stuff. It was helpful, but never powerful enough to help more than having a fourth damage dealer. The empathy mutation was about the only way to make that support build contribute enough, but the build was incompetent when solo and empathy's downside wasn't reduced by Class Freak.
---
Oh thanks, thought I couldn’t drop em because of the quest.
---
New grist for the rumor mill. You people are fucking ridiculous.
---
I was in survival mode. There were as many shops open for business as there is in adventure mode. I wouldn't destroy a camp in adventure mode.
---
This, people love to be fatalistic about shit. If the only thing keeping you playing is melee in a fallout game, idk what to tell you.
---
logical conclusion, therefore the opposite applies!
---
Um? Fine, I guess.
---
I like the sound of this.
---
Why are you sure?
---
The weapons themselves aren’t capable of one shotting anything, it’s the multiplying effects of stacked perks that give some weapons crazy output. I can one shot glowing ghouls with a vanilla one star axe after I stack all the slugger and glowsight and bunch of other perks plus the mutations. This entire Fallout game is built upon perks, unless you destroy the entire structure you just have to learn to use it. 
---
That being said there are selfish asshats who would one shot everything even when there’s a bunch of players nearby, best way to counter this is forgetting about your melee build, just bring a tesla rifle or a shotgun to those events, put yourself on Pacifist and keep firing at the crowd of glowing ones, you’re guaranteed to loot almost all of them.
---
But if a few fusion cells or shotgun shells aren’t your thing, you’re probably out of luck.
---
Why would you care if someone repaired their gun during a queen fight? Literally has no effect on you? Increases your chances of winning?
---
Pvp is the only place where it could effect you and you wouldn’t even know if it was used or not. 
---
I play pvp and haven’t had one instance that I can blame on repair kits. It’s literally to fast paced and wonky controls to do all that in the heat of battle anyway. 
---
If you don’t have 2 or 3 good guns or weapons as back up by now you’re doing it wrong.
---
They are threatening the developers with the "I WILL TAKE MY BUSINESS ELSEWHERE," like they aren't the problem that everyone else would love to see out of ALL online games.
---
tell that to people in project paradise
---
ultra-light armor pieces give +5 AP per piece
---
I sure didn't, that's pretty lame. Though, it happens in most online games. MMOs are usually the ones that suffer the most. Really messes with the in-game economy.
---
If they let me wear two boxing gloves, I'd sell my Deathclaw Gauntlet in a heartbeat. I have two hands and the wasteland is about to catch them.
---
Your mom keeps hogging the blanket.
---
The recipe record I'm talking about is the type in the game files not a recipe you pick up and read in game. It's simply how some things are stored. It also depends on if they want them to be able to be sold at vendors or not because how they choose to do that could cause extra work or they could use existing systems (fractional caps cost versus existing record structures). There are many more ways to skin this cat those are just two suggestions.
---
R.i.p you, but like I said to some one else based on there sneak skill, and with a certain amount that they could take
---
Is there any kind of perk card that shows your throwing arc? Like in fo4. I have terrible aim.
---
Hey man, i've never got it before......I just thought it was common courtesy
---
Most annoying thing ever in pvp
---
Please explain how vats doesn't work, shotguns are more accurate and have better range than rifles etc aren't exploits, they are just game mechanics. I guess when people used a work around to be completely invincible that wasn't an exploit, it was a game mechanic, right?
---
Do you know where I have to go for the archery test, not the one on the terminal
---
Then they want an AoE *stagger*, yeeesh
---
If you check your "inbox" reddit gives you the option to send a dm to whoever gave it to you. Editing the post seems annoying.
---
Sounds good except of vats doesn't work on select people at all, a full meter is useless.
---
Good to know
---
Eh, now I feel like a dumbass. I'll just edit it out
---
I wasnt in view of them but I'd seen them on the map.
---
Got mine for 80, someone had 30 of them in his vending machine. It’s like duped junk fire sale.
---
I want to be able to use it to craft specific hide armors. If I kill a Yao Guai or Deathclaw (or Scorchbeast) , I'd like to be able to wear it as a status symbol.
---
Still it just would t be a good mechanic if I come across some lv 40 that just got their first 1000 caps then I have all the maxed sneak perks and I steal all of their caps, they wouldn’t be very happy and would lose fighting back which would cause them to lose caps either way
---
Got any clues around your camp or is it just a guess game?
---
Didnt you used to be able to hit multiple enemies in FO4? I ran a melee super sledge build and I swear I could hit 3 enemies at the same time
---
Depends on the day. I change my prices all the time trying to get the best price I can. Usually between 5o and 100.
---
yes there is
---
If you're vending and actively advertising your camp, then I totally agree with you. 
---
I like to keep my camp location completely hidden, and my space private. That's why I lock my doors.
---
You can probably search for sheepsquatch event guides but what level are you?   You generally need a lot of stim-packs, and if you're going to be the conduit the generally accepted practice is to tag the sheepsquatch for XP/rewards, but stay hidden or up on the roof of the shed and just stay alive.  
---
The health drain gets heavier with each additional conduit.   Just for reference - I used med-x but not a ton of other DR prep, and consumed about 10 super-stim and 25 regular stimpacks with 2 pylons.   You could use a lot less if the other players take out the squatch faster.  In retrospect I should have just grabbed all 3 pylons to keep it vulnerable as there were a couple of delays while someone became the 3rd conduit.
---
Good news is a server announcement goes out when you start so everyone knows they can join.   Look around your server before you start to make sure there's a good amount of high-level players around to help win.   Hope that helps.
---
Atomic Shop getting ready to update the colors of parachutes
---
All well
---
I've got to say, I can totally see a BR mode in this game.
---
2 day ago this was a daily challenges and the worst it was only worth 10 atom (im a level 121 and i think i only see the flatwood monster 3 or 4 time)
---
Get over it or just don’t play the game ever again. They been fixing they been adding content and still as if that’s not good enough for you just leave go play anthem
---
Lol so what, he could get more caps
---
That intro on mr five by five gets me every time. Great soundtrack, but would benefit from a couple of new songs if that was possible!
---
People complain that there's nothing  to do in the game and your solution is to add this mind numbingly boring thing
---
There is ZERO chance any player will ever spawn in the single locked room in my CAMP.
---
You could just.. not play the battle royale mode.
---
"We had some difficulties with dev" is all the contrition we're going to see from Todd. I've mostly enjoyed my time with FO76 but I have very little respect for him and his "I read on the internet our games are buggy" attitude.
---
I use MIRV grenades, orbital strikes  and hallucigen gas.
---
This happens to me whenever I forget to re-set my mtu's after lagging a lobby on GTA. I assume that isn't your issue right?
---
Lol p2W ok outrage Charles some ones been watching overreacting youtubers it seems. Goood thing you don’t play the game right RIGHT??
---
They just want sheepsquach loot and they want it as fast as possible.
---
Getting some unneeded stimpacks and purified water isn’t worth slowing down the sheepsquach kill or even possibly not being able to find the body of it dies while they deal with the bramin.
---
Until the actual event has worthwhile rewards people won’t care.
---
Sadly no I couldn’t do anything but watch as my character did the animation 
---
If this happens to you just restart
---
Like a terminal you can store your holotape games that saves high scores. It'd be another good reason to visit everyone's camp. I'm going to get the high score on everyone's copy of Grognak.
---
PvE! PvE! PvE! We want PvE!
---
in the office building outside Glassed Cavern
---
Yeah I get the same thing and I gotta I q I need to do in there it's so annoying.... also on xbox one x
---
Omfg you did not lose a fight because of repair kits lmao
---
So more reduced fire rate? Something like -30%?
---
This is exactly what I want
---
This... so much! All of it. Couldn't agree more. I am dreading that Nuclear Winter is just going to be a Battle Royale mode, with some superficial factions paint optionally tacked onto it.  Pick your team and go shoot each other in the face on repeat.  Instead of... actually rebuilding and reclaiming and helping one another in this game whos theme WAS rebuilding and reclaiming.
---
I'd love more real beefy and robust and permanent world events that result in map changes to go along with big story arcs. Rebuild and protect the train tracks and stations in a world arc event that results in trainyards being free to travel between from then on. Rebuild and protect the nuclear power plants to give power to the entire area and be a foundation for settlement building and science research. The return of npcs and settlers, making permanent city hubs after a community rebuilding event where everyone's material contributions are counted toward the success of the rebuilding, and choosing what kind of thing or style of thing to rebuild first, all kinds of ideas that can be done with this game. There is a lot of potential. BR just seems... so pointless and narrow.
---
Do people buy those? You can do line in the sand for 2 or take a power plant and drown in them
---
People do this to prevent losing caps when they're close to the 25,000 limit.
---
What is the benefit of that?
---
It's one of the higher priority items that enemies will attempt to destroy when attacking your camp. If they don't have easy access to it they simply choose the next highest priority item to attack. Locking a door isn't as foolproof as making it completely inaccessible by the means available to enemy AI (they will destroy a wall to get to it instead) but it's a step in the right direction.
---
Project Paradise
---
Fallout or elder scrolls would be perfect for br... i dont agree with you at all
---
The nuclear generator and the anti-rad sprayer took the most resources to repair if they were destroyed.  Everything else is pretty trivial.
---
Check the fallout76settlements sub 👌
---
Doesn’t necessarily need to be balanced against the base receiver but the way you worded it was like it would be the same but conservative on ammo
---
Well, it is an easy fix for this so I would assume some time in December they should have this resolved if things go great.
---
I mean... If they did that, the sky would be full of vertibirds ferrying players to and fro. Not sure I'd like that. 
---
Now, regular vertibusses that leave from bus stops around Appalachia and follow a pre-set route, that I could see.
---
if I’m not mistaken each additional piece decreases the shimmery “aura” of your body.
---
Yeah but casual players usually don’t have very many caps I mean I’ve got a fe mules that are loaded but most people don’t play like that
---
Yup cause your playing style is all that matters in a multiplayer online game.....
---
Thank for letting the rest of us clean up your scraps.....your so generous.
---
I think "powered" is just the name given to pieces with the action refresh speed increase.
---
My guess is they are the same as the weight reduction pieces and that AP refresh and sneak detection max out at 90%.
---
Raiders used them a lot in FO4. I'd love to have those on a small track system to make a mobile turret.
---
Marsupial hop from bottom to top.
---
Yes. when they are selling a lot I raise the price, when they slow down I raise the price. Some people never leave their power armor so use lots of cores. Also the laser gattling uses them for ammo.
---
It's much more challenging when you get the assaultron. I would have preferred the wendigo my first (and second) go round because I died so much to that laser beam of death. I did get the wendigo on other characters and it's much easier side-step it's powerful attack.
---
Won want to be able to skin and wear a Super Mutant
---
While wearing a squirrelhead
---
Besides weapons and mutations the best and only way to improve your build is to put the PA away and become a sneak/stealth build. Ninja perk alone gives 3x damage with melee. 
---
I can 1 shot nearly everything with a serrated combat knife using same perks as you, plus ninja. Get a nice instagating melee weapon with swing speed bonus. Typically, I only use ammo on SB and creatures that could maul me to death,  yao Goa, deathclaw, etc.
---
Oh man, you shut me up.
---
I never leave mine and have never felt like I couldn’t get more cores in like 20 minutes max if need be and to hell with the buggy Gatling lazer it breaks my heart to say but it’s kinda shit. It looks cool but it just isn’t that good
---
You're in for a treat:
---
Unlimited supplies.
---
Invincibility.
---
Place in Red.
---
And that's just the start...
---
...dad?
---
no shadowed but does offer Sleek
---
yeah, i would take fishing over battle royale anyday
---
It takes affidavit but you can just cycle through numbers. 1111, 1112, 1113 and so on and so forth
---
but the wastelanders will all be dead before you meet any.
---
The battle Royal is probably going to be in vault 51 and plus hopefully there will be more stuff in nuclear winter other than the battle royal (I'm not exactly for the battle Royal but if it is in vault 51 then I hope there is a way to bypass it)
---
Duh because I don’t use them ya dense mf. I’m gonna get the crayons out now. 
---
I didn’t say I lost a fight because of them? I said you wouldn’t know if someone used it in a fight against you. 
---
As in you don’t know when their weapon breaks or they repair it.
---
The circumstances are to specific. You repair your main gun, I switch to main gun 2. No difference. 
---
You run off and hide to repair your gun via kit, I run off or FT and hide to repair at a workbench.
---
Again you’re just blowing it out of proportion.
---
I hate the assholes who kill the Brahmin after the event is over.
---
Listen here boyo. Reinhardt deserves death
---
I have a handful of propaganda posters for sale at varied levels of high pricing hoping a generous soul visits and gets the joke.
---
It's fine, have them walk a gauntlet of punji boards to disarm them in future. Disease cure are more valuable than bone!
---
Never assume an event is empty. Project Paradise doesn't spawn on its own, someone has to enter to trigger it. If you don't see anyone there it's likely they're sneaking to avoid having to clear the robots and deal with them respawning yet.
---
sometimes grenades will help. plasma seems to help me most
---
What? Can we get pet frogs now or something? How do I get one?
---
Games are supposed to be fun. If you aren't having fun perhaps you need a break? Try again next patch. For reference, that's how I put up with it after playing since November last year (\~1k hours played). To be fair, the majority of bugs that my friends and I have encountered have been just plain funny or easily ignored/worked around. A choice few were devastating to a couple of my friends (they left and haven't come back yet) but in the end it's a game. Treat it as such. Walk it off and try again another day.
---
I hate server hoping, but I suppose needs must, enjoy joining the droves of one shot charlies on their 2 shot explosive duped god weapons and enjoy your future ban.
---
Yup need all 3
---
Yes, the "diseased" prefix overwrites the legendary prefix and the "toxic" emblem overwrites the stars.
---
The problem IS the RNG ... it's not RNG .... it is manipulated to ensure that some things are so so rare, they don't ever happen.  It messes up the actual RNG, and causes issues with the game play.
---
I'm gonna try this. Thank you.
---
Events like these should have a legendary reward, not a legendary boss. Until then this is going to keep happening because a lot of people are only there for the legendary.
---
I never use my power armor except when in nuke zones.
---
What exactly does hallucigen do?
---
DCG ?
---
Its in perception
---
It most certainly matters, and how do you know there is no computation?
---
This isn’t an excel sheet where the information is just there. Every time someone goes to look at a the vendor, it has to make a call to the database.
---
It then has to find the user, identify all the items, it may need to calculate the current condition of any food/drink in the vendor based on how long it’s been in there, reassign any food/drink that has expired to the appropriate spoiled item category.
---
The database has to do this for all players, as they actively use, find, and store items. Every time a purchase is made, evertime a player repairs it has to calculate perks and INT and the new condition, etc
---
This is not as simple as an simple access database that a single user is keeping track of a number of items because everything is dynamic
---
Womp womp. It’s not your stuff anymore.
---
*claps*
---
Well said. Yeah, my expectations are definitely set to a minimum for stuff like this. It’s still awkward that this isn’t a single player fallout game.
---
 A little formatting on the Armour would be nice. Mostly not great, the Armour.
---
 As was said, Twisted Muscles, which is 25%+ Melee. A Glowing Meat Steak is another 10% for munchies.
---
 You have to pick one handed or two handed, the perks are different. I like knives but I have no idea what your pet named The Quick Fix is.
---
 Get Adrenaline maxed, no one rolls with Ammosmith slotted.
---
 Endurance is useless. Get 3 levels of Fireproof and some DR.
---
I’m on PS4 and the random A-hole is rare.
---
Server hopped Bolton Greens (about 12 times?) until 2nd body of tourist appeared in fountain. I liked this spot because I could snap zoom  through a  scope to check the fountain after every hop without having to engage hostiles, so quicker turnaround time on hops.
---
That doesn’t help me as much
---
The incentive is getting the actual fucking event rewards that don't drop anywhere else. The alpha drops the same shit as any generic three star legendary you can find anywhere else. Tagging the alpha takes all of five seconds then your ass should be making sure the even actuality completes with a live friendly.
---
Haha yeah yeah. Nice try. Judging by your post history you’re no stranger to high prices, like let’s say a traveling leather coat for 8k. Well played dude. Quality troll post!
---
No worries.    
---
For further fine tuning, watch a couple "unyielding build" videos, there are a few more perks that make it much much better.
---
That’s fair enough if you’ve not got a vending machine. But people that have but don’t want anyone using their stuff when someone’s probably paid to get to their camp is selfish.
---
Damnit now I actually want the game
---
Yeah. I get it that some players are idiots. Which is why they made it impossible to destroy camps now. 
---
But if someone can'tdamage your camp, it makes no sense that you should be able to harm them with a trap without there being consequences.
---
Grahm has it
---
Lets lose the entire VATS nonsense. ;)
---
I have a corridor leading to my machines lined up with rad emitters and flamethrowers behind the walls. Gets em every time. I lock em in using a powered door so there's no escape 😈
---
Well if the guns fire rate is slower, but has more damage per bullet. Doesen't it make the gun take less ammo to kill enemies and so help to conserve ammo?
---
I hope i'm not being rude to you.
---
&gt; 'We're not making a battle royale game here' patches one in anyway.
---
&gt; 
---
Pretty sure they mentioned wanting a battle royale mode in the documentary noclip put out last year.
---
Lmao. Enjoy paying real money and breaking Bethesdas TOS instead of playing the game how its meant to be played I guess. Also, if this was a duped weapon it wouldn't be just a 2 star, it would have a 3rd star with a god roll as well. Who shit in your cereal this morning ?
---
Wowwww that is absolutely ridiculous. 10 atoms?!
---
It's completely a battle royal mode.  
---
There's some other stuff too, but the big ticket item is last-man standing fights against other player characters.
---
I hope they scrap their entire launch plan and just come out with:   
---
"The bags....are here.....AND THEY'RE CANVAS!!!!!!"
---
Sorry about the formatting I'm on mobile and it looked fine on my phone before I posted. The Quick Fix was one of the weekly challenges. It's a switchblade.
---
I too am curious. I hear even radroaches are excellent locksmiths, so protecting it from enemies doesn't seem likely. Perhaps there's a switch that powers the vendor terminals that isn't meant to be played with by visitors?
---
I learned this lesson the hard way too. ALWAYS trade important items from anyone not just mules. Even then items can get lost but its far more rare.
---
Crud. On the one hand, I *need* those.
---
On the other, Arkos is ugh.
---
Thank you for clearing things up for me
---
That would be cool, hopefully they give some kind of master control like that when private servers are a thing, but honestly I think if Bethesda saw this recommendation they would start working towards a new pvp game type and some more camera challenges.
---
Sorry to hear that happened man. I really am. When on the PVE server, people need to leave others the hell alone; I don't care if it's while claiming a workshop or not and it's opened PVP because of it...it's nonsense. There is a separate PVP server for a reason...if somebody wants to snatch up another person's junk like that, they can go there. I hate being randomly fucked with while I'm trying to do something. It's annoying as hell. And because I don't ever really react back, it usually doesn't have an effect on me. So I really can't imagine how pissed I'd be if I lost that much shit. Hope you can restock all that back. 
---
PS: I'm waiting for the "don't carry so much junk with you" folks. I know they'll show up.
---
Really? I'm level 61 and I've killed that bitch twice
---
&gt;other saving 5 seconds of your time.
---
There you go. Like I said, It's a very minuscule advantage that some people don't even consider such. With the alternative being spending time and effort and resources on Queen or Imposter, or just time and effort scrounging.
---
And it really, legitimately does not matter how stupid something is, people will buy it because they have money and simply just *do not care*. If people were always sensible with their money, the entire business model of gacha/mobile games would not be profitable. At the start of April, about 2 months ago, Pokemon Go broke **2.5 Billion** dollars in revenue. It was released a little of 3 years ago. Fate/Grand Order hit over **3 Billion** in March of this year (it released in August of 2015). Fate GO is literally fucking anime tiddy waifu sim. It doesn't even have a PvP mode. It doesn't make sense to me either.
---
You may not have ever considered buying repair kits of the AS and you think it's stupid. I do too. So does most of this subreddit. This subreddit does not represent the entire F76 player base.
---
I found 2 in footlockers and 1 on a gulper when there was a daily to kill 1.
---
I use a cryolator with crystalizing barrel for queen fights and I can't say I've noticed it has any effect on her landing. It does freeze her though, even in mid air, which makes it easier for the heavy gunners to focus dps on her.
---
Epic back story. 10/10.
---
I’ve taken a couple of months hiatus from this game and I just came back so I was unaware that there was a previous skin that was similar. But yes, this was in the item shop
---
I just brewed it. Other Nukas I got from the one frat house that has the Nuka Cola room. One can also spawn in the TNT dome with the Quantum X01 paint
---
I often get stuck in camp foundations... One time though, I got stuck, then fell through the map into the void, only to land in the camp and die from fall damage.
---
Some vendor camps really need to up their customer service.
---
But if they are dead how are they invading?
---
I think Bethesda were afraid we are going to collect all the badges in just few days and made some of them impossible to do. Like the Stimpack Diffuser and the Musician ones.
---
Thank you.
---
That’s an interesting idea putting bounties on others, but that might back fire in adventure mode. If someone drops free stuff for someone say a new player or is trying to throw stuff away, those players who find it or don’t know any better, will be punished for it. There’s players who role play as raiders and after reading many comments, I been more understanding and enlightened of how others feel about it. Yes, you could fix the issue of gifting by trade menu but it’s more of a hassle plus not many newer players will know what to do.
---
Looking forward to your other conclusions.  Nice work on the base damage increases.
---
This change was a while ago. Like months. Definitely not a bug
---
For people who enjoy playing Fallout 76, a lot of you suggest ideas to avoid actually playing the game as much as possible
---
Thank you so much, it finally spawned!
---
It was a patch a little while back. All faction vendor cap pools were merged. The limit is still the same per day, but you don't have to go to 7 different vendors now.
---
The Whitesprings is like a box of chocolates. You never know what'cha gonna get.
---
Several patches ago they made it so all vendors share a single cap pool to make ot easier to get your 1400/day.
---
Man. Nice job. That's a lot of work.
---
I was trying to think of a funny response even before your edit, but couldn't. I'm a failure
---
welcome back!
---
&gt; hmmm, and what is a "console"? It is literally a specialized "computer" which has limited and known hardware (which thee game is optimized for)- and what was my claim in the beginning? That with the diversity of hardware on gaming PCs, this mess could not have been avoided. I never claimed there were no bugs, nor that thee wasn't server instability.
---
So you either are illiterate or purposefully misunderstanding what I said. 
---
I said LoL and PoE are BOTH PC games yet they don't have issue with stability over many different hardware configurations. Which means bethesda has zero excuse for their shitty coding, because it isn't due to different hardware as if that were the case then both PoE and LoL would also have lots of bugs because they are both played on far more pc's than fo76 ever has been.
---
&gt;Your claim is that "it runs all the same"' then there would be NO DIFFERENCE between consoles and PC and there is, as you have admitted in this previous comment and is well known.
---
No, you are misunderstanding what I said, I said a program written in c# or c++ will run the same as another program written in the same language, like fo76 vs PoE and LoL. Yet it doesn't, it falls apart all over itself and can barely run on computers well beyond what the recommended specs are for.
---
&gt;and that is why I hinted, partly by sharing that link, that you may have to tone down your system and turn overclocking off- or maybe even underclock (and sorry, no I didn't say it outright) but we all know that consoles have crap for procs compared to PC even without overclocking.
---
OCing doesn't matter unless your OC is unstable, but 48 hours of prime 95 torture tests proves my OC is rock solid stable. Also, my OC won't make the servers crash, which is what the main issue is.
---
&gt;And i seriously hope you know that standard clock speed is determined by the probability of system crash under normal circumstances. Any time you overclock you increase the probability of crashes.
---
Which is why I run torture tests to verify my OC is rock solid and stable. Do you even understand how overclocking works? If the OC is stable in prime and such then it will be stable under gaming as well. Prime 95 is literally designed to verify your OC stability.
---
&gt;and all this is compounded by a massive world being transmitted through a network- you know like the damn invisible enemies- it doesn't matter how good or fast your system is if the client has not received the data to render aspects of the game because there is nothing there to render.
---
I don't know what you are even talking about with invisible enemies, I've not had that issue. As my internet is well beyond what is needed to run this game, I have run private servers off my internet numerous times for years. My internet bandwith isn't the reason their servers keep crashing and bugs are everywhere in the game.
---
&gt;An easy case in point- I have not had any invisible enemies since the beta-- until i was too damn excited after hoping servers seeing Uranium Fever and fast traveled before the world fully loaded- and yeah they killed me and yeah, my junk had not even spawned by the time I respawned but it did after 20 seconds, aas did the enemies- that is straight up network lag
---
I've never had invisible enemies at all, the only thing like that I've had is dead bodies disappearing as soon as they are killed. That isn't a bandwith issue, that is a shitty server issue.
---
&gt;Could it be optimized, sure and for the most part it has been slowly getting there, but you have to work within the limits with that and when joining a new server just wait- then all is good-- or i could bump my 35 mbps up to 50 mbps and it would help (even if it doesn't cure it completely) and that isn't something that Beth has control over, now is it?
---
If the issue was bandwith related you'd have a point, but it isn't. Just like the dupes that are back, the crashes 50% of players get trying to access akrtos, and the numerous other bugs that are back in the game aren't anything to do with bandwith. It is purely bethesdas shit ass coding on the servers.
---
&gt;And you got it all backwards- i am not the one saying that "it is all Beth's fault"- i have repeatedly alluded to it being more complex and that those on PC have to address what they can on their end because hardware varies- and that (at least used to be) literally the point of having a gaming PC. (edit: that is optimizing the computer to the game)
---
I know you aren't saying it is bethesdas fault, that is the point. IT IS THEIR FAULT. Bandwith doesn't cause servers to crash out, or half the player base being unable to access the content because it crashes as soon as they take the elevator.
---
You just keep trying to blame everything BUT bethesda for their shitty server software.
---
Man i need a player like you at my vendor! Mostly low end stuff like stims/ nuka cola variants/ and drugs sells well very well in fact. But im on 1k shotgun shells and 10 cores eating up my space. 
---
I price cores with the number value so full ones are 100 and half ones are 50. I suspect no one in the forest needs cores and shotguns are plentiful from scorched.
---
As for the grind.. Its real sometimes. I got 3 workshops couple days ago and my whole sessions was defending them/unloading them. Thankfully i dont need to do that for a while. I got 50 Salisbury steaks! Cause why not. 2 caps a piece lol
---
I throw pumpkins at the sbq like the green goblin.
---
I be found so many AFTER I did the initial quest
---
There's a difference between dropping items on purpose, and being killed!
---
At least there should be!
---
Well not really daily, this latest patch had barely any fixes and if anything made the game more unstable. I think by know Bethesda cares more about what they want (repair kits) than what the playerbase wants
---
Hotkey the stimpacks for sure and armor up.  There's a few perks you can also equip to improve stimpack efficiency and to auto-use them when your health is low (forgot their names and too lazy to look up).
---
Something like a cleave perk, similiar to diablo 3 barbarian cleave skill.
---
March? Sheepsqatch, Ever upwards and Arktos. Unless you want to grind for god-ish rolls.
---
I do switch between Slugger/ Gladiator when needed. I know my armor isn't great, that's why I'm posting asking for advice. Thank you for the advice btw
---
then what incentive is there to actually help?
---
there are enough freeloaders already...
---
Perhaps the Cryolator is best for a normal scorch beast and not the queen then!
---
Is this a trap? 😂
---
PvP should be removed entirely from adventure mode.
---
true
---
To bad the new dupes that are out are just filling the game with more of them.
---
Now, that's no way to talk about yourself!
---
That brief moment when you have to gamble on which direction to run to clear the foundations ASAP...
---
It's not bad at all. The story is very emotional, and I think they did the factions better than NV. The dialogue system and lack of skill checks is my biggest complaint. The combat is almost identical to 76.
---
This is the dumbest hill to die on
---
Yh i tried but it juat doesnt work its better in this game because if im playing woth friends i automatically join there server unlike other games where we have to go through the whole invite thimg again
---
Edit: geez guys, it's a joke, lighten up
---
The amount of players left, they really don't want to be alienating any group still playing. There is a reason they won't let the numbers of players be known, because it is a tiny number. The loss of more players would probably kill the game when they are trying to keep it afloat with the atom shop. If people aren't playing they aren't using the atom shop.
---
BGS has a marketing department that studies who plays when and for how long.  You may not like the decision, your friends may not like it, but BGS did not think it would increase their revenues they would not do it.  And while some clues point to there being a BR mode it has not been confirmed so its just a rumor at this point.  Maybe we get more info at E3, until then I am not going to get my shorts in a twist.
---
Added, thanks for mentioning!
---
I've wondered this myself there is no reason to lock doors. I actually have no doors
---
The information is correct. Thats the exact reason he datamined the actual values. its 9% per hit and 50% cap. 10 second window to reapply the effect and have it stay on.
---
Did you have a camp there with a junk extractor?  Or did you just harvest the junk pile manually?
---
When you're spec'd for heavy you should ditch the gunslinger cards for some ranks in adrenaline instead.
---
It’s always done that, especially if it’s a complex base or a stacked foundation base... usually it stores in one or 2 chunks though
---
I think a Battle Royale has potential to be really cool! Imagine if we got to choose what faction to fight for, battling with our teammates against the other factions to see who comes out on top. This could be awesome! It doesn't necessarily have to be a traditional battle royale where everyone's dropping in from a plane with no inventory. I could see myself playing quite a lot of that.
---
Bethesda is sweating looking at this post...
---
Son of a b&amp;%$#! That means my furious, explosive, faster reload cryolator is not as good as I thought ;( Glad I read this before making the build, thank you!
---
Thanks, Satan!
---
I think someone stated it already, but if the event and the best reward is from the boss, people are not going to care about the event rewards because they're trash. Just putting it into perspective. Now if they give legendaries as an event reward then you could get your wish, but until then people are just going to sit there and kill the boss and ignore the cows.
---
When I run it solo I just ignore the cows. When I run it with the group or a team that I protect the cows. You got to be honest the event rewards are trash
---
Bethesda already said no human NPC's will be added to the game. So I doubt anyone is invading outside of maybe a handful of robots.
---
No, it is not anyone's responsibility to seek out your correction. You say all he had to do was scroll down. Lets turn that around, all you had to do was edit your comment to include your correction. You wrote a comment that was wrong, and even though you agree you were wrong you refuse to actually alter said wrong comment. If you spill a drink in one room cleaning the floor in another room wont fix that mistake. 
---
If you had already made an edit to correct your mistake and _then_ someone had commented anyway to call it out, then you'd have a point. But as is, your unfactual comment still stands unchanged. Correcting yourself elsewhere doesn't change the fact that people stumbling upon your original comment still read misinformation.
---
Reddit isn't a "conversation" as you are trying to paint it. We're not all sitting in one big room and hear what everyone is saying at all times. Not everyone reads every comment in every thread, because very few people have that amount of time on their hands. But that's completely fine because we have an upvote system to self curate. Just as we have an edit system to change our comments if we wish to alter our statements. If you really felt your statement was wrong, I dont see why you wouldn't edit it to reflect that
---
Data mining and clues that are in the game right now. You should watch the juicehead videos on it they are interesting
---
nice job! ill be following along closely
---
I want both PvE and PvP to be expanded, I am PvP focused, and I believe you are right in your approximation that PvPers are in vast minority, hence, more PvE stuff would be appropriate now since we got our survival.
---
Story stuff costs money. Player vending doesn't cost money and has been a big hit. They need to do more stuff to increase community without costing money.
---
I mean, granted, new story lines are always welcome, but think like a corporation here. We paid a one-time fee of $60 or whatever to buy the game (and many of us didn't even pay that) and they're expected to come up with new stories until we die?
---
yeah, i had a FE build in mind i gave up on after i found out how the effect worked, i'm going to go for a F 25%FR plasma rifle instead
---
I use rifles. Nerfing melee wouldn't cause me to quit.
---
Some people like carrying their junk to make room for their characters stash box. With Packrat, it’s possible to store lots of junk onto your character so you can save stash space because it takes up more space to store it then carry. Ever since player vending was implemented, players who have large shops with variety of various items most likely carry a decent amount of junk or they are on another character to sell stuff.
---
In the end it really was unessesary to have ever add them
---
Haha. Let’s see. Where would this guy have put down his founda......SHIT!
---
I'm PvE only but really if it is a BR, it's whatever. People who hate the game are gonna hate it anyway, people who love it will anyway. BR won't offer much for me but it would offer something new for some people playing the game, and that's better than nothing.
---
upvoting because i think it's still a learning curve for both consumers and manufacturers, from a solo to mmo environment paradigm.
---
good hunting.
---
the baddies will freak out and attack each other
---
Thanks, I'd say deciphering and extracting the coordinates only took a total of around 4-5 hours, over the span of 2 weeks or so. Mouse and keyboard macros helped a lot.
---
I can check on that one in a couple of hours
---
Yeah.... that would probably happen
---
Well, I am not entirely against it - although I am not interested in the BR or PvP in this type of game at all, it may help them to realize it was a bad idea and that not every game mode that has a success elsewhere means that it must be implemented into every game. Or maybe not, it will be a huge success and we are just wrong.
---
Really? Thats cool
---
Acceptable losses. 100% casualties, you say? *Still acceptable losses.*
---
The new event, you end up with hundreds of glowing meat in habitat A. Cook and sell. Have more mats than I can hold from the event too- all honeybeast and yaogao drops.
---
The legendary drops are enough to max script (and then some). I've sold formula p plans and bear arm plans for 2500 in vendor. They sell fast at 1500, can't keep in stock. The only downside is ammo. I had to go back to my usual spots to craft more but that's normal even for queen farmers.
---
Sold a couple 50 cal drops from the event too. One troubleshooters exploding with faster while aim. Other one was a 2\* furious +15 limb. Then you have scrip for the molelady on top of all that. The other way is queen, but I like the new place. The nice thing with queen is you get stable flux, can make serums to sell to the vendor- that's fast caps and productive because of the queens loot table.
---
or power up the plant
---
Yeah I quit doing the challenges because a lot of them are ridiculous and not worth 10 atoms.
---
Are you talking down to of lieutenant? 
---
Don't state the obvious! 
---
❤
---
I also found two while I was clearing west-tek, one in a tool box and another in a crate of some sorts. If ya need one it may not be a bad place to check. 
---
I wanted to put them in my vending machine for players, at 0 caps, but it wouldn't let me : /
---
It’ll probably end up the same for me live fallout 3, I get stuck with side quests and exploring that I don’t even beat the second main mission. I’ve yet to find and talk to three dog
---
That’s true with the Imposter being the exception. If I tank all three rods and sit there burning through stims so everyone can kill it then I should get the reward as well because without that she can’t be beaten.
---
The *entire DLC* will certainly not be Battle Royale. This mindset is really annoying to me. What, they're not allowed to make a BR mode as an option for players? Just because Reddit thinks Fortnite bad?
---
And what's more, people here are entirely ignoring the fact that Bethesda calls Nuclear Winter a "new game mode", like Adventure and Survival, but they don't call Hunter/Hunted (you know, their BR mode already in the game) a "game mode". The roadmap says that it's "An entirely new way to play Fallout 76, completely changing the rules of the Wasteland." A BR wouldn't "completely change the rules of the Wasteland", since a pure PVP experience is already in Survival.
---
All 3 100%.  And it doesn’t drop super often!
---
It really should
---
Impressive work!
---
its around the pioneer camp

It's one thing to not finish the main quest; it's a crime to not talk to the Triple D.
---
isn't stimpack diffuser the same as, diluted stimpacks?
---
haven't done arktos yet.
---
2h yes. 1h no. unarmed no, except for the meat hook and mole miner gauntlet (which require double dipping on perk cards).

I’m sorry! I was busy finding things for my house in Megaton...

When I saw those fishing rods on the little pontoon I thought OH NO WAY FISHING TIME!!

Guess I’ve just been getting lucky, then. For a while when I had been building things that usually got stored as one whole piece as long as I made it on a concrete foundation.
---
I want to run from the cold weather like division 1's survival mode

The longer Massive ignores putting this mode in Division 2 the more worse they'll be off

but its still a super diffuser.
---
bump. i've got 3 toons with distinct builds and perks.

Powered = Ap refresh

The leather coat, rare technically but its pretty much designed for it
---
Literally an IT. Have a good enough understanding.
---
lol cry more
---
For the time being yes. See the latest patch notes for reference. In short, the fix is taking longer than expected and did not make it in the last patch. Get it while it's hot! Only \~2.5 days left...
---
Most of people who use TSEs in PvP are weaklings, accuracy penalty is definitely not worth it for vast majority of the weapons, I see myself mostly on top or 2nd weekly best killer in survival servers I join and I don't even have explosive weapon as my main gun.
---
Be prepared for some backlash on this. 
---
But the short of it is just go and play it and tell for yourself if it is fun! Don't rely on people's reviews, YouTube, or Reddit to help you decide if you're going to play a game. I'm well over 300 hours into the game and I still find it fun. So take that with a grain of salt.
---
Looking at the data, are you able to see anything that would gie players assistance in specifically finding the flatwoods monster?
---
Getting closer to that 6 month window close. I just checked the status of my support ticket and it still says "investigation ongoing".
---
Meh, I had some time to waste and was in a fighty mood.
---
Manually. I swear it happened twice for me in a session. Could of been back to back plays tho.
---
It’s so super.  I actually love the mist haha!
---
Unfortunately I’ve never seen a Behemoth in the Ash Heap...
---
I was thinking along the same lines - something to build the stacks as quickly as possible to (hopefully) benefit from it more often.
---
It's great. Can't stop playing it
---
there are very obvious clues
---
This is amazing!
---
Level 156, can confirm PvE is wayyyy more enjoyable then PvP...

Not your problem

Add me BirdJP19
---
i've seen it three times, once it immediatly teleported, 2nd time it was in a castle tower near Berkley Springs where I couldn't get at him, but he could take potshots at me, and dead near whitesprings after someone else killed him
---
Unless it is Blizzard of the 90s to mid 2000s, generally marquis developers don't find success by copying existing genres.  As a throw-in for an existing product, I'm I don't see much of an issue, but do hope they continue to take risks.
---
Thanks.  I figured it might be a bit annoying for those who have been playing to hear yet another potential newcomer like myself asking "is it worth it?"  I bet this has been asked ad nauseam, but I really appreciate the insight.
---
Grind if you want to grind. The good thing about the legendary vendor is that it gives you something vaguely productive to do with all the legendary trash you find rather than dumping it on the floor.
---
The scout badges for upgraded backpacks take a ton of work, if you need something to aim for.
---
VATS does work, I use it all the time. The claim about shotguns just isnt true, and clearly you dont know what an "exploit" is. When people were walking around "invincible" it wasnt an exploit as you keep calling it, it was a an overpowered armor mechanic that needed balancing. You havent helped your case at all, only made it apparent that you don't have any clue what you are talking about.
---
I love the mayhem it causes to ghouls
---
Take a picture of 76 players all fighting the scorchbeast queen while wearing a Fasnacht mask and a straight jacket at 12:00 while naked and intoxicated and giving the thumbs up pose.
---
Tl;Dr face palm
---
I don't even know what your goal is with a post like this. 
---
You want people share in your pain, sure I get that. But there is so much "nope" here. 
---
Never let down your guard in a workshop. The junk you carry, be prepared to lose it. You act as if HE knew you were carrying all that stuff. Or that you were close to maxing out on caps. And then you blame him for using game mechanics (sneaking) But let's face it, he server hopped. Because as soon as he picked up your stuff he became waaaaay overencumbered. Possibly past that carry weight +1500 threshold? He might of caught a glimpse of what he just got and may need to take some time on deciding what to destroy. Or at least switch some perks around anyways. 
---
Look. I hope you get some sympathy. This community is great with that. But also sometimes they just want to verbally facepalm so bad.
---
I mean, he's the director of the games. The director has majority say in what happens with the game etc. Sure, there are probably higher ups who suggest things, but they still have to go through Todd.
---
Plus, it's mainly a meme at this point.
---
Its fun now! Only new rule in the game is your character has to wear a dress.  I know, Bethesda and they're crazy patches.
---
See ya in the wasteland!
---
She gave me a 3* Explosive handmade. Sold it for 6k in my vending machine
---
Mhh yeah but the question is, is there a market for endgame low lvl weapons?. But I think Max lvl is a better decision
---
Unless they were garden gnomes, I'm gonna have to report you.
---
It’s my best gun it has the highest dps in the game
---
As others have said.  You have to start the quest.  Naturally in fort defiance before you can run it as an auto daily.  Had same issue myself and reading notes/terminal got things working fine.
---
There's plans
---
Just make it so that the legendaries are rewarded after the event is successfully completed but leave in legendary bosses just for the challenge.
---
Join the pioneer scouts and you’ll get the plans for a frog jar in the chemistry station. You’ll need to find a captured frog and you can build it in your camp.
---
It was garden gnomes actually, I do have three
---
I also saw it at a vendor in WS. I think toward the N end of the hall.
---
Yes, this! Ridiculous to aim for middle enemy and miss right and left enemy when you swing...I'm  like are you kidding me how did I miss them...this would be great!
---
While reddit and youtube may make it seem like it, not everyone is constantly suffering from crashes or disconnects
---
Pipe weapons (at least most of them) benefit from both pistol and rifle perks.  You can get a bit more efficiency by adding master gunslinger (+10% damage) and reducing your master rifleman down to level 1 (going from +20 to +10).  Should keep damage the same but for 1 less perk.
---
This. First it seems like itll be limited to just one vault. plus the fact that the reddit fanbase is basically the minority of people who play fo76. If anything reddit makes up like 1-5% of players
---
Bloodied, talons mutation, adrenal reaction mutation. And andrenaline in agility, if you’re really a risk taker like me I don’t mind dying so I just run lowest possible health with nerd rage, oh and last but not least serendipity for a 45% chance to dodge damage
---
Maybe you are the stupid one? I want god roll items , not xp+stimpacks so what’s really the objective ?
---
  I agree that adding the legendary item to the event loot would solve this some of the problems but not all .
---
I'm still in awe at the fact that they make the legendary reward come from an enemy instead of a reward. They give you a guaranteed 2* armor piece from the scorchbeast, and multiple other dailies can reward a legendary weapon, so we KNOW it's possible.
---
Im on the other end of value. Stims/healing salve-nuka cola variants- drugs. Besides ammo these things tend to fly off the shelfs in the forest.
---
Sold 1 star gauntlet and golf club but i put them at 200 caps for the nub melee guy. The club was instigating so its pretty good low lvl pve. 
---
Also plan i feel like are best sold here too. I got a new character and finding a stove blueprint for 50 caps was a no brainer when its over 200 at the robot.
---
go grab a copy and play the game you may be pleasantly surprised. listing to ppl bash something they hate for no reason but to hate something is low IQ crap. like the you-tubers that are still butt-hurt they were not invited to  Greenbrier still bashing it 8 mounts later, get a life losers. is the game perfect ? nope i cant use my pip boy sitting down and that sucks. but i'm still 930+ hours into despite that 1 MAJOR flaw....
---
I don't agree. Think of it as more efficient in follow through..not sure of I made any sense there..
---
So it has. I don't know if it's on this sub or another one but I'm pretty sure they either delete them or send them all into one thread. 
---
Just play the game. You'll have fun and enjoy it as long as you don't take yourself too seriously and get stressed about the game any issues that has with it
---
Fort Defiance check the boxes.
---
Like 120 feet. The location is at shore of small swamp.
---
while there are other visual differences they could have a different barrel to make it look like the MG34. Decrease Firerate for more damage or acc.
---
Ooh nice. I'll keep an eye out
---
It's probably not going to be battle royale. I mean that's basically what survival mode is, from my limited understanding of it and from the 20 minutes I've played of survival mode.
---
i only PvE. and i stopped playing because its annoying to get items. and more story items would help greatly.
---
Pvp just makes pve less fun due to needing to balance for pvp.  I'd prefere it remove from the game all together and they focus on making pve more events and more social.
---
Im fine with a BR mode Red Deads is pretty fun i dont see why FO76 cant fallow how they do it i mean there are enough factions for teams and everything i honestly think it could work abd might even get me to reinstall
---
Seriously, its ridiculous. I’ve seen 2 star junk rare weapons selling for 2.5k... people really need to learn how to price their weapons properly. **NO ONE is going to buy it if it’s overpriced**. Some people need to learn how to play the market
---
Op isn't talking about increasing damage just improving technique.
---
*Android users crying in the distance*
---
This doesn't mean I want it. Sheesh.
---
these do not land, you have to shoot them down! aim for the thruster
---
Nah. Theyre already set on what the gamemode is and Reddit posts wont change that. Though it might be that some of the people at BGS Austin might also think that it isnt a great idea, the higher ups wont budge. Im just hoping that it will go well and wont be as big of a disaster as the initial launch. Though looking at how poorly the engine can handle a game like 76, I dont think it will be super smooth
---
I haven't seen Encryptid for a week or Arktos for three days. I've literally only done Arktos three times, and the third time was such a gong show that I'm not sure I even want to go back. Same goes for Encryptid, success for the first week or so then nothing but constant failures.
---
It's definitely a trap
---
[No :)](https://i.gyazo.com/5d57f186409d21412f0627e7216c40d6.png)
---
Me too my friend. It's still gonna be really interesting to see the E3 reaction if it is what we think it is.
---
This subject gets posted at least three times a day here.  The mods have even put an automod script in to stop people from posting it, but it doesn't work very well.
---
Here is your answer:  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bn33ul/is_this_worth_buying_or_coming_back_to_the/
---
Its definetly not gonna be the typical BR since its most likely happening within Vault 51. Im just concerned how it will run. And I hope it doesnt end up being a disaster like the initial launch. So heres hoping the engine can handle a gamemode like that
---
this. once players get all the recipes they want the events are really only worth the legendary drops.
---
No ones going to get banned for buying a duped weapon from a vending machine.
---
I like the gun in its current state.  As someone stated before, it’s the highest DPS gun in the game on large bosses.  The downside of this gun is finding the ammo to feed it.  It shouldn’t be an everyday farm Wes Tek gun.  What helps me is priming the gun, then I can make .308 in 4 times the base amount for just one additional flux and one ultracite, it makes feeding it much easier.  If you are on PS4, I can prime it for you if you don’t have the plans.  My farm guns tend to be Gatling and Harpoon Guns.
---
Went to a camp Yesterday and found a vending machine that was behind a lock door level 3 on a second floor of the building. Thankfully there was an opening on one of the wall and I was able to jump on there water purifier and then into the second floor.  Lol. But why do that? Sigh
---
I stopped looking at them months ago when they were supposedly easier. Mostly because of the bugged ones that still don't work (following them as a guide became a complete waste of time and pissed me off) but I also came to the conclusion that they were consuming too much of my time that I'd much rather spend doing what I want. I probably won't bother looking at them ever again if the recent complaints are any indication of their direction, except to check my total hours played per account.
---
I can't agree with always dropping 3*. What loot based game always rewards quality loot from bosses? It would lead to people doing nothing but farming bosses and every other post on this sub will become "increase the legendary vendor to unlimited". Now we're just playing the slot machine game.
---
Sure, increase the chances from bosses, maybe significantly, but not instant win.
---
Do you see "Growth: ______" or "Bravery:________" or something? The 3/4 you see are the tadpole scout values you have completed.
---
If they get rid of pvp they need to get rid of workshops. Without it a single person can occupy every workshop on the server. 
---
But I see workshop's value and therefore I don't think they should get rid of neither.
---
A foundation on the ground with a staircase up to the the height you want it. I had 2 trees to work with and the regular floors and walls just allowed the tree to come through no problem before the update. Now i cant even stick a roof over a part that has a single twig poking through.
---
Run Uranium Fever with a couple of people. Collect all the weapons. Walk down to Whitespring train station, use hard bargin, and profit. Other than that you can equip cap collector and do cap stash runs. Do a YouTube search for cap stash runs at Morgantown (10 stashes), Posiden (9 stashes, 3 bobbles,2 mags), and Nuka Cola plant (6 stashes, 1 bobble).
---
There are probably people who will enjoy the mode and thats cool. But looking at what people originally wanted out of 76.... yeah BR is not it
---
So is five pieces is 90%? Does it stack with AP regen?
---
&gt;Crash to your desktop three times while intoxicated.
---
too easy. that's a normal tuesday night.
---
I need this ShowHealth mod. I did some tests by screenshotting the bar and counting pixels, which was too slow for Furious. I would recommend level 50 Watoga protectrons for testing though, as they're easy to find and trivial to hit even when moving.
---
From the ESM, the max stack should be 9 hits, giving +5% damage per hit, and 10 seconds effect duration per hit, so your test results fit pretty well. I don't have a good explanation for 10 vs 11 hits though.
---
My guess is that misses have no effect, and you can actually put stacks on multiple targets, with the only limit being the 10 second duration, but it's not clear from the ESM.
---
I don't suppose you have any TSEs or explosive shotguns for testing? Still not sure how the mechanics work there.
---
Have you tried the Rock-It Launcher, yet? Firing gnomes at people it hilarious.
---
I’ve seen this were the player becomes the item ur looking for and we had no idea what was goin on.
---
&gt; I had 90% weight reduction of junk through perks and armor bonuses so why not?
---
Because of this exact situation where if you die you lose it all.  Pack rat perk card is great when you're doing a resource run, but using it to carry all your junk rather than keeping it in your stash is a bad idea.
---
tl;dr
---
Battle Royale would bring more people to the game they need to get rid of shops and make the map smaller.
---
Ditto.  I’ve seen more robot plans than metal, and I’ve barely seen any of those!
---
Sorry if you get a notification on this response and think someone found them 😃
---
they have golf and tennis in GTA online, poker and liar's dice in RDR, so why not?  bring Caravan into appalacia.
---
Cool.  I'll just jump on top of somewhere enemies can't reach me within the event zone and let you burn all of your resources to earn me a legendary drop.
---
Sorry bud, datamining has shown them putting in challenges for the mode already. Definitely Battle Royale (I fucking hope im wrong)
---
Can u still get the good rewards if only one friendly survives ?
---
Heh. Not falling for that!
---
Animal Friend does in fact work. I stopped a Radstag from trying to kill a teammate and then it just wandered around while a Friendly Animal was nearby. 
---
Though, I may need to do additional testing, since there's always the possibility the AI could've glitched out
---
in addition bloody mess rank 3 helps if you up your luck enough.  carnivore mutation doubles the benefit from meat, use psychobuff chem, run unyielding armour set, use tenderizer in charisma.  
---
use bloodied weapon, talons/adrenal/twisted muscles mutations.
---
You. I like you.
---
Too funny.  This happened to me as well.  I opened a 0 lock and it triggered a wanted status.  I went around for almost an hour in PVE and everyone avoided me so went to PVP (Survival) and got someone to gank me to remove the status.
---
I’ve never gotten any of the unique stuff if only one survives, but it might be possible
---
I’ll try it, what’s the item id?
---
Holy shit I had no idea the Marine wetsuit headgear was that cheap to craft thanks
---
They don't.  All cargobots wind up west of the mothman museum across the river.  Depending on how long the server has been up, you can see 10 or so just flying in circles.
---
I believe there definitely is a market because I was a part of it at one point (leveling alts is a lot of fun with "twink" gear). Is that market large enough to garner your attention? It would appear not.
---
But, more to the point. Not everyone will be going to the purveyor on a mule. At least some people will be going there for potential upgrades for their current character. To me it only makes sense to get level appropriate legendary from the purveyor. Put yourself in a lower level characters place. Your level 20 and you go to the purveyor to get some scrip and gamble on an upgrade only to find out you can't use that item for 25-30 levels? Bit of a bummer doncha think? Those of us with mules (or friends to help transfer items) can easily circumvent this "issue" but the same does not currently work in reverse.
---
I hated survival at first but I’m not into camp building and you can only grind and farm for so long in adventure so I split my times. I use a totally different build in survival so that can be fun.
---
Even works on Sheepsquatches!
---
I know that.
---
Its fallout, not the sims...
---
No, without joking, i would love something like this, but it does not need to be an event, just the games seems fine, and a "hub" location for it
---
Would it really though? I mean people who are into Fortnite, Apex, PUBG, Black Out and however many other BR games there are now... I dont see why they would be interested in buying a 60 dollar game thats known for being broken and unplayable and has been memed to death, just to try out a new battle royale experience.
---
Dont get me wrong, I really hope the launch goes well but seeing how badly the engine can handle multiple players, I feel like its gonna be that smooth unfortunately
---
I was at a dudes vending machine the other day where they were selling the shielded BoS officers underarmor for 1.5k. I couldn't freakin believe it. I have three sets of the BoS officer's underarmor that I bought from vending machines for about 50 caps a pop. If modded I don't think they should sell for more than 200 caps. Period.
---
It’s a hard one to argue, at the same time you could sit there while I kill all the enemies in the One Violent Night event and then you just pop a shot at the wendigo and insta-kill it, haven’t I pretty much earned you the legendary in that instance too? 
---
It’s just one of those where there’s no real perfect solution but I’d rather see everyone get a legendary than some who worked the hardest miss out
---
I’ve read several times on this sub that 3 pieces of AP regen gear is optimal.
---
I have not read about what combo of action person and lone wanderer is optimal.  I run both.
---
That would be great! Rank 4 of the Big Leages perk in Fallout 4 allowed to hit all enemies in a close range in front of you with a melee weapon, and it would make for reliable crowd control! Would love to see this implemented
---
I just re downloaded this game to see if its gotten better in the last few months, if they add a total mode ill uninstall it again cause that's just wack as hell.
---
This is cool. I hope you have a good time ;)
---
I've heard the voice lines in the game too. Im just hoping it wont be another disaster...
---
Iron fist, Martial Artist, Incisor.
---
I can’t figure out how to help with that. Do I just “gather wood” and it automatically goes into the fire, or do I have to place it? I haven’t been able to see any effect when I gather wood like the earlier phases of the event.
---
Vampiric LMG (with 25% faster shoot and 50% limb dmg) was the first loot she gave me.
---
Eversince I visit her, she gives me "meh" present.
---
Maybe I was too lucky...
---
True, but still, should be avoided in such events because of human nature.
---
i'll poke my mate and see if i can get the rip from the actual ingame data. thanks for the link!
---
I was listening in on the Convo once too and it reminded me of the two AI chatbots that were pitted against one another in Convo. I thought I even heard some of the same lines they were saying but I could be mistaken.
---
Nah you just jumped the gun wanting to be funny and ended up showing what ass you are. Own it. I gave yet to hear another person say they script legendary weapons, search the forum, I did. Who knows maybe it will catch on if you hope it enough. Dick
---
Still I like messing w low levels but I wouldn’t be too happy if I was new and lost all my caps to a high lv then got killed and lost all my junk too, it’s not my problem but in general I try to be helpful
---
Why do that when you can get much better ones for free in abundance from the SBQ? All the faux outrage was hilarious. Now we get to sit back and enjoy people looking stupid.
---
Is there any chance the scripts are open source? :)
---
Honestly.. If it's done right I'd play it. I don't know
---
Lol i love repair kits. Haven't bought a single one though because the queen drops them.
---
See the main post - not for the foreseeable future I'm afraid. Should I get round to a second version it probably will be
---
Interesting. Thanks!
---
Ah
---
0000434b
---
We had 3 survivor. Not all of them was rank 3 (none of them) and none of them where at 100% at the end.
---
Second time, again, 3 friendly was alive and I got the super stimpak plans.
---
So it is not even 100% drop rate if you have all 3 beastie alive.
---
Death Claw Gauntlet
---
Same. I'll play it to try it out but they NEED to fix the lag and net code issues. I mean you cant go 5 minutes in the game without getting your melee hits not register or something lagging out like crazy. I dont know how they can fix all that for that gamemode
---
In that case, I think they should just disconnect the vending machines from the power source to take their camp off the map.
---
I mean, if I can kill quickly so can anyone. But really all they need to do is learn to tag stuff. Standing around while stuff beats on me uses up MY resources. I have no obligation to let stuff beat on me for 30 seconds while everyone gets shots in on everything unless they want to toss me some stims and radaway as well as materials for repairs.
---
Sad thing is if you look at release all the negativity was just outrage which was hilarious lol. Only problem with the repair kits in the atom shops is it sets precedence on what other non-cosmetic items will be sold for atoms.
---
If there weapon is put away you cant vats them
---
Are there other locations?
---
I’ve been trying to figure this out. It’s good to hear u only need one friendly alive,  has anyone done this solo?
---
Problem is modded uses flux, I assume that player was a noob so flux is rare to them. But, yeah 200 for upgrade might still be kinda expensive depends lol.
---
I like it when they come at me with a pitchfork and drop a gun.
---
True, I hope they get their asses sorted out before going and releasing a whole new way to play this. Although, god forbid it turns out to be a wave type gamemode.
---
I'd love it if we could get blackjack, poker and stuff but it doesnt make sense in Appalachia
---
What do you sell the lines underamor for?
---
I have one too, and I love it, but the lack of mods makes it pretty dull
---
Yeah that's a point haha. Ok I have to think about the next step before moving my mule. Thanks man!
---
Hahaha. Someone has something better than mine. Ban them!!!! Reeeeeeeeeeee!!
---
You're right for PvP. For pve explosive guns out dps guns with vat crits. Even if you have 30 luck and all of the crit perks.
---
Huh? I bought the plans from the Grafton vendor last week
---
At best, repair kits are an inconvenience item. You spend real money for a repair that isn't nearly as good as a normal one.
---
no clue
---
What?  For variations of a 10lb melee weapon with no legendary opportunities?
---
Everyone of those^
---
This is my build 
---

---
To late #DeadGame
---
The one problem with removing legendary bosses is people can afk like in the faschect event expecting others to do all the work for their lazy asses. So, its true removing them will make people focus more on the objective, but honestly players are dumb they don't read or listen to the event instructions and the events sometimes don't explain the complexities well either. Also, event like paradise needs to be server advertised for players joining the server and when the event starts.
---
The bos mod plans do increase stats. Grafton station vendor
---
I could be wrong but it takes like 4 violet fluxes to mod the shields right? The armor itself is like 60 caps at modus bunker, each flux goes for 100 maybe? (I don’t sell those but that’s my impression) 1.5 k might be too much but 200 caps is like charity price. If you’re selling at that price I’d like to buy a few.
---
It doesn’t give warnings anymore?
---
I buy the 6 packs. You can use them via inventory, don’t have to be at a repair bench.
---
I agree, but with the legendary vendor now, ppl are hungry for every legendary they can get their hands on.
---
Some other advices ? I'm at 8/10, looking for darillon, ixode, wolf etc...
---
We desperately need a "no mic" emote.  But on Xbox, at least, you can set a "mic required" flag in your Looking for Game posts.
---
Grafton Station Vendor sells them... it was in the patch 9 notes
---
You have to get the Dry kindling then go to the fire and add it
---
People won't care as long as it's not where they spawn into the bloody camp
---
If you glitch inside the vertibots there is a central bench and 2 gunner positions,
---
For e, depends on the initial value.  For plans under 100c, I price it at about 1/2 of list.
---
For stuff over 100, about about 35% off list.
---
Their weapons weren't away. They were shooting at me. Lol
---
Deathclaw power armor. Fixed that for ya!
---
In PvP
---
That solves absolutely nothing.  People will still run off to focus solely on the legendary boss and leave the actual event objectives to fail same as before.
---
Wait, so are you referring to the mod that is in the same category as Fiberglass, Shadowed, etc? Or is there another BoS mod I’m not privy to? The one I’ve got brings both DR and ER up considerably
---
For PvE, Explosive guns out dps VCrit and 10% aiming by a long shot. That's even with 30 luck and all of the crit perks with Vcrit guns.
---
PC, and it totally depends on where the "default" spot is for the camp
---
People will bitch about this same thing whether on an adventure server with pacifist enabled or in survival mode after I killed some kid today I heard him scream 
---
“Stop taking all my stuff!! I’m just playing the game mode for the XP boost not PvP!”
---
You sound like that kid
---
Looks like braille to me
---
They probably just put in the vertibird skin and never took that out.
---
That math seems off.. lowest i can set is 1cap per round
---
BuT ThEre aRe nO NpCs
---
Fake news. I’ve never used an explosive,  two shot weapon or vats for any of my kills and I know I am not alone.
---
When did they say none will be added to the game?  
---
  
---
I know they said theres none in the game, but I dont think iver ever heard them say they would never add any
---
Do you still have those plans by chance?
---
I say for everyone on the map. I don’t go to SBQ or ISS much lately but when I’m farming elsewhere and see those events pop up, my heart and thoughts goes to all the people who actually waste their ammo there. I deserve my share for the moral support I provided.
---
They announce on their forums when they are doing server maintenance
---
I dont think this is possible on pc, where did you put that in? Or is it an xbox thing
---
I would love to see an option to turn some guns into turrets. The laser turrets are basically automated laser rifles so a Gauss (rifle) turret with a slow rate of fire and high damage would be great.
---
There's only like 5 or 6 landing pads
---
In the fo4 vertibird skin there was only 1 gunner position, I think they’re gonna add a new feature for whole team fast travel
---
I'm clearly talking about people with Advertised camps ;)
---
Completing Free Range doesn't matter like it does for PP and Campfire Tales.
---
Explosive guns out dps Vcrit guns with 30 luck and all of the crit perks. +60% to overall damage can't be made up for by +50% damage to crits only.
---
Jesus Fucking Christ.  You literally read nothing but the title and rushed down here to complain didn't you?
---
You would  STILL getting the SAME EXACT chance at a legendary drop as you would have now.  The ONLY difference would be that it's coming from actually finishing the event over bum rushing the legendary and not giving a shit if the event completes or not.
---
So there were a ton of events without legendary enemies. These events were rarely participated in because of that. Some were still done for plans/recipes. But I disagree with the OP. Legendary enemies should be at the end of every event to increase participation. 
---
Free Range Brahmin can be defended by a single defender. So if you're complaining that nobody is protecting them, then in fact you are not protecting them and the cause of your own complaint. 
---
Project Paradise is more complex. Depending on how many friendlies are still alive. But the class 0 friendlies are so fragile that we expect them to die once the predators come out unless there's multiple meat shields hovering over the tick or whatever. This requires early participation of a lot of people just to pump the class of the friendly. Otherwise a single rush of a predator can fail the event. I spent time hovering over the tick while the other 3 in an event dps the fog crawler. They had no internet in protecting the tick. Again, if I didn't go and defend it, it would have died from the 2 ghouls that ran at it. So it really is a bystander effect on defense of the friendlies or Brahmin. So stop complaining that other people aren't doing it and do it yourself. You can hop on the mic and ask others to defend, but if they won't even after that, it's really on you if youre not defending. Lol
---
Yep. Never killed another player, have no interest in killing other players, never touched survival. I honestly have no skin in the PvP game. I believe that there is a PvP element in NW though: I just hope it isn’t the sole focus.
---
When you hit the button for vats and nothing happens, that means it doesn't work. If they were crouched, stealth boyed, chameleon etc then it would make sense, but they weren't. They were doing the exact same things as the people.that I could get vats on. As for the armor mechanic, when there is a specific set of armor pieces and perk cards that make you completely invincible that is an exploit. You aren't supposed to be able to be God and take no damage. Just like the exploit with specific pieces of armor and perk cards that made you permanently invisible.
---
They used to drop all the time.  This is a bug that was introduced in Patch 9.  I submitted a bug report about it already.
---
There’s sufficient variety in weapons and armor, along with them dropping at different levels coupled with the wide variety of perks.  3-star enemies should always drop 3-star gear, but the grind could be for a top-tier roll and/or for a specific item.  This applies for all 3-star enemies everywhere in Fallout76.
---
Just came across a person with one myself
---
[Paintball](https://imgur.com/a/pB0lRCC)
---
Yes, Grafton station vendor sells them as of patch 9.
---
Go to the air port and kill low lvl scorched. Should find one easy
---
Ran a silo and nuked Whitespring, and killed a SBQ with 2 different sets of friends yesterday.  Yes, the instability issues keep roaring back, but it's Fallout With Friends, and if you always wanted that, this game will scratch that itch.
---
This character is a straight health build.  No bloodied or junkies, etc.   The perks on him are all fucked up.   My shotguns are only strong enough at this point to cripple not kill.
---
So you'd have to claim the workshops with helipads to use them
---
Find a Deathclaw hide.
---
Collect 3 Royal Jelly without server hopping.
---
Like This? [PaintBalls](https://imgur.com/a/pB0lRCC)
---
Maybe for PvP. In PvE, you're dead wrong if you think you can out dps the +60% damage from explosive guns with +50% to crit damage only. Even with the best crit build possible.
---
There are two different types of AP regen effects:
---
1. AP refresh armor, Core Assembly, Corn Soup and others add to the ActionPointRate value. It starts at 6 for humans but I haven't tested whether that's also true for players. AP refresh armor adds 5 per piece, compared to 3 for Corn Soup. There's no maximum cap in the data, although there may be one in the code, as with movement speed.
---
2. Action Boy, Nerd Rage, Well Tuned and Well Hydrated add to the ActionPointRateMult value. This starts at 100, so it's probably a percentage multiplier.
---
A reasonable assumption would be that ActionPointRate is multiplied by ActionPointRateMult/100 to get the action points regenerated per tick.
---
Then wtf are you asking for? He answered your question
---
Where would I find the plans for an Impulse Grenade? I don't think I've ever seen one.
---
On Xbox, but that's just awesome. I think I know the answer, but I unfortunately can't test it.
---
There’s non PvP alternatives to contest workshops and there can be a limit per player on workshops too.  There’s absolutely no reason to have PvP in adventure mode, other than someone in Bethesda seems to have a big boner with PvP.
---
If it was a supply req then it will drop. If it doesn’t drop and flies around it’s a nuke key card and those have to be shot down. If it gives you a quest to open it up once it’s dropped it’s a players so ignore it but if you shoot it down and nothing happens you can get a nuke card from it.
---
Nuke zones should count as rad storms.
---
It might be that 200 caps is too low but I also don't believe in price gouging lol and I see waaaaaay to much of that on here. But I gotta actually get them modded first haha. I've been putting it off trying to get the Hunter's long coat
---
I wholeheartedly agree with you. But i gave up to think it will change.
---
 As soon as some heros see ⭐⭐⭐ or (Legendary) they start hyperventilate and nothing else count.
---
 Just to put their earned *level 10 nocturnal junk weapon* into the shop for 2000 cps.

Don't do 3-star weapon rolls; 3rd star is rarely worth twice the scrip cost; and make sure you're on a server that's treating you right before you go visit Mole Nana.
---
I love the new content, personally; I'd rather fight a Sheepsquatch than pretty much any other enemy in the game.
---
As long as you have the permission of the people who created the scripts, as far as i (and most others i think) am concerned, its fine. Open Sourcing it gives the whole community to use them as a base.  
---
imo there is also no need to upload the 4GB dataset. As long as scripts can extract it.
---
19 base agility with bird bones, plus 20 from an unyeilding agility set should get you very high, not exactly sure how high though. I think one of the underarmours might also give agility, but i might be wrong. You can get another +1 from a legendary weapon, so at least 40 agility is doable.  Make all the armour ultra light for another 25 ap
---
I’ve disconnected maybe 3 times since launch and I’m lvl 91. I haven’t had too many issues.
---
Yeah. I misspoke. I mean the cargobot never dropped its cargo. I said “landed” but I meant “dropped its cargo”.
---
Mama murmur is heavily into bashing. Six out of 12 pieces of junks I got yesterday had bashing as a legendary feature.
---
Does that fro me as well.  
---
Frustrating, yes, but then again, you can look at it as an opportunity to get a little extra XP :)
---
We really should be able to build them an inflatable pool from the folks at Wavy Willard and it should be the crocodile mascot with spots for them to swim in via a 'dirty one' with the Plan available in game, and a Clean Version in the Atom Store.
---
You're Welcome Bethesda ;)
---
I’ve been assuming the whole time that Nuclear Winter would be a hardcore PvE experience where the entire map is pre nuked and all enemies are way stronger because of that.
---
Oh
---
Jesus Christ... READ THE ACTUAL POST.
---
You would be getting the SAME EXACT CHANCE at a legendary with the ONLY difference being it's a guaranteed drop with the event rewards over being something you have to tag and loot an enemy for.
---
I'd rather have the loot available to those that help killed it. Sorry if you're blocking an extractor while mole miners are attacking another extractor, but once the mole miners attack your extractor, you're gonna be the one that gets the loot. Best thing to do in this case is to team up with the folks. Some won't team up. Nothing you can do about that other than make sure you get the hit in. But if you're teamed up with 3 others they'll lose out and you can still loot the bodies from teammates
---
Youre here because you like 76? Because if not go play fortnite.
---
And tell them without the pylons at imposter event it's useless to shoot at it while invisible.
---
You can stock up on it since in that stage wood keeps respawning and you need probably 8-12 total.
---
Thanks, will update
---
Oh. Woah. I had no idea. Thanks!
---
I admit, I just screwed this up.
---
I didn't know free range was sheepsquatch.
---
Noob me has learned.
---
Horray lvl 13.
---
Sorry to the guy trying to help me!
---
I use mostly unyielding on mine. I use 2 handed melee though so I have all the slugger perk cards maxed out. You would want to use the unarmed perks to increase damage output of gauntlets if you're not already. You also would want to utilize the adrenal reaction mutation and talons mutation if you aren't already using them. I also use the radicool perk which raises your strength has you become more irradiated.
---
Rip
---
Yeah, there are no other legitimate ways to get the plan. If you see it offered by a player for much less than 9k caps then it's duped.
---
Thanks. I am sure you are the absolute authority on legendary pricing.
---
My better question is why do you care what people want to charge?
---
I really like this idea. It would give people an option to actually build a cool kind of settlement for people to visit while still allowing the player to explore and have a small "camp" thats always nearby then can use to store items and scrap gear.
---
I did. Seems you don't understand.
---
You miss understand, I'm saying that your legendary roll from the boss isnt given to you until you complete the event successfully. That solves your whole complaint.
---
Psst! The mounted ones light up!
---
Yep. Scorched is the way to go in my opinion
---
Yea some people’s prices are outrageous, I don’t know how they can sell them. But anything involves some fluxes won’t be dirt cheap simply because the price of fluxes won’t go too low.
---
No doubt. Bye, Felicia.
---
You have to buy the miner/excavator maps from the u-mine it machines to trigger the event
---
Low level scorched mind you
---
So you are angry that one weapon type is better than another?
---
I hope you pop a quick "H" on that box first....
---
I come across folks with mics all the time.  You usually have to say something though before anyone will speak.
---
I just want all players who use two shot explosive weapons to be banned and their accounts deleted, what's wrong with that, sounds like a plan!
---
If you don’t hit checkpoints, quests dump you back to where you started the time before until you reach the next checkpoint.
---
This is the best option though, wipe it out immediately before all the idiots leave the defense animals and fail the event. By all means, if anybody has some horrendously overpowered bloodied build to kill the alpha in 30 seconds, please do so every time
---
I wouldn’t mind if nuclear winter wasa pve horde mode kind of thing
---
Gotta down it fast to complete the event before more mobs spawn and kill the friendlies.
---
I wouldnt mind a battle royal mode since it might actually encourage one of my friends to get the game since he's a sucker for everything thats a new BR game, lol, but I would much prefer more PVE and questing.  
---
The option to head into BR would be a bad thing though
---
Lucky Strike is triggered when you purchase dig maps from the Excavator Vending Machines in the Ash Heap.
---
Why is this being downvoted
---
Since it takes me 4 punches to kill the sheep squash, that is protecting the cows as that'll end the event!  
---
I can get that done and guarantee us the event rewards faster than us struggling to take out the bugs!
---
Just came across this guy, then I remembered reading your post about it.
---
Obvious troll is obvious.
---
Yea obviously😂 Im not assuming anyone has no mic without trying to talk first
---
I pick owned locks by accident all the time, the best way to get killed after a tiny bounty is to unequip all your armour and fast travel to Vault 76. People will flock to kill you, never had to wait more than a minute.
---
It's a map you have to activate that gives you a quest. It has never been an event.
---
Don't digital objects in a game have a unique I.D that follows it or are I.D created new as the item type travels through the game, we don't know so sounds risky to me.
---
Clearly you didn’t read my post because I agreed with you on that part but as of right now there is no point in worrying about anything other than tagging the legendary so calling us stupid for doing the smart thing really just makes you really fucking dumb 
---
Ps you shouldn’t use the lords name in vain , congrats on going to hell
---
hmm,  just click treasure   on the side   https://gyazo.com/998ff25b88f882c4a3f43d43b419539e
---
Could any German, French, or Italian please screenshot or copy/paste these spoilers for us?
---
pretty please?
---
They arent crafting items. They are mods to armors. So if u go modding mode and u have said eligible pieces, u will see them as armor mods like pocketed/deep pocketed/lead lined/BoS/etc
---
Lock your door, just put a chair or workbench within "reachable" distance outside, so that we can teleport outside without fast travel.
---
Yes that was me!!   Pale Rider Ex armor.   I had such a blast last night.   I was in a crippling zone and the 1* shit legendaries were flowing like sweet wine.  Yeah I ran with several 2 man teams and we cracked skulls....or knee caps as it were.   Through the whole time I was getting positive vibes and one dude dropped me 10’stimpacks as a thank you.  Now I have to lug my 800 pound ass to the station and scrap some leggie rolling pins!!
---
Ahhh 👍
---
If you cant defend the animals you should just quit the game
---
Absolutely, if is fires explosive glowing explosive AOA god rounds it should be deleted from the game.
---
Eh it's something to do at least.
---
Oh crap
---
Lab coats work well in a pinch.
---
Anything good come from it?
---
There are a dozen spawn point for PA in the forest alone,  Those are generally 25%, but they work.  With batteries included and the energy ammo weight reduction perk, they are 0.3 # per.
---
Fusion generators sometimes have them.
---
Some events drop them as rewards.
---
You have to take the PPlant workshop (risking PVP) and power up the core processor to get 100% cores
---
NPC Vendors have them for something like 250c each.
---
Player vendors also have them for varying prices.  I sell them at 1c per percent of charge.
---
There is NO intrinsic difficulty increase in legendary enemies, this was something that existed in 4 but for whatever reason they dropped for 76.
---
They have the same stats as their non-legendary versions, the only difference being that they regen 50% of their health.  This is why I said at a bare minimum all they would have to do to compensate for the removal of the legendary flag is increase the base health.
---
I hope its like a free for all deathmatch or TDM, not royal
---
Hopefully you left clues around? Or else its not happening
---
I price ALL forms of shielded underarmor at 550 caps and they always sell out in the same session I put them in my machine. Some people price stuff really cheap because they don't come on the forums and are uninformed on the value of certain items in the game. If I can sell something consistently at a certain price I'm going to keep pricing it at said price. If you found shielded underarmor for 50 caps a piece consider it a lucky find.
---
Lmao i always check ppls’ ammo deals. I find it funny that ppl put anything above a 1cap for a .45 or any regular ammo. 
---
Many times its not the items ure selling, but the prices that just turn ppl away.
---
Thank you, folks for the direction to the Grafton Station vendor!   I've been peering steely-eyed at the patch notes for weeks, and somehow missed the note I was most carefully looking for.  But now I go back, and there it is: clear as day:  
---
&gt;**Vendors:** Now reliably trade in Armor Mod Plans that were previously randomized, including Brotherhood of Steel Combat Armor mods and Deep Pocketed Mods.  
---
I'll have to check in-game now: mods, here I come!
---
Most everyone who gives half a shit about this game has everything from the event. Legendary &gt; event
---
I don’t think they are and think those like you are overreacting but you don’t play the game any way cause it’s so pay to win so why are you even here?
---
Why would you want to delete the coordination aspect of a multiplayer game? You only want a shooter looter reward system?
---
For most people, it takes considerably longer to take the sheepsquatch down. I can’t rely on you or someone with a similar build just conveniently showing up. 
---
Also, in my experience, the cows will continue to take damage from bugs even after the sheepsquatch has died. There’s a window of time where the squatch is dead but it’s still possible to fail the event if the cows die in that timeframe.
---
Your friend is either pretty dumb or Shopping reasons to quit the game that won’t hurt your feelings. It’s not HIS fault he left, if those bastards at BGS hadn’t added his most hated mode. Have they mentioned any other games they’d like you to try? That’s step 2.
---
Don’t ruin muh tantrum with facts!
---
There’s legendarys all over the map. Who cares if you miss one
---
What makes you think that I don't play the game? 
---
It's only a matter of time kiddo mark my words
---
Thanks for the data
---
Is it not in the green zone?
---
No worries! Glad I could help
---
Limb Damage is typically useless on a shotgun, because the cripple effect on Enforcer and others has a x9999 multiplier when it procs. The only creature that could possibly require multiple cripple procs is the SBQ, and I'm not sure about that.
---
They do maintenence on Tuesdays.
---
And, there's a 20 minute count-down.
---
I might but I dont get off work for another 8 hours. I can check then and message you.
---
1st. I've never experienced the issue you are claiming exists nor have I ever seen any proof of it so I'm thinking you are just saying that fir the sake of tour arguement. 2nd. They weren't "completely invincible" by any means, I could list 10 things to kill them easy. 3rd. By your logic owning a TSE pre nerf was an exploit because you "arent supposed to be able to one shot". OP gear is NOT an exploit, it's an unbalanced game mechanic.
---
I visited a camp at Whitesprings last night that someone had built a lot of turrets around. They also had a locked door guarding their building with crafting benches inside. I just sat and watched as it was destroyed by ghouls.
---
Mostly ore and scraps.
---
Because this one makes you waste 15 minutes to get to it
---
Nice work, thanks for your dedication. I immediately wondered how a furious shotgun would compare?
---
That would be nice. Maybe even let it spawn different enemies and without xp kill them
---
I was the level 26 in a hazmat suit. Along with the level 21 in a hazmat suit. No idea who he was no idea who you were but everyone worked together and it was amazing. I can't thank you enough. I was able to gain four levels in less than an hour and only died once.
---
I’m not so interested in getting the max dps figures to be honest, I’d rather play how I enjoy than follow the latest meta weapon and armor set up like lots of people do. 
---
Can you imagine how boring it would be if everyone ran around using the exact same weapon? Oh wait a minute...
---
With Gunsmith 5\* or Makeship Warrior 5\* and Luck of the draw 3\* I hardly need to repair weapons, I got 5 repair kits I think from a SBQ but haven't used them.
---
Do trades...
---
The alpha doesn't give you any better loot than a 3* charred ghoul or super mutant overlord. If you start this event just for the legendary, I don't know what to tell you
---
Right now the only strategy 99% of players use in these events is to abandon the actual objectives and bum rush the legendary boss.  How is that MORE coordinated than being able to actually divide your resources between the objectives of defeating the boss and defending the friendlies without screwing over anyone who can't get in a tag on t he legendary?
---
I buy them in extreme pinches. So far bought 1 of the 6 packs
---
Gotta have duped God rolls to trade.
---
That is what I'm dreading , being FORCED to pvp so I can get X that I need to complete Y in another part of dlc. That will make some non pvp players quit the game if we are locked out of quest rewards . We already have content we are missing . Weekly guns for survival, most of them suck . But if we really want the one out, no choice but to pvp. Bethesda hires bill Cosby to be the bartender at lady's night.
---
Tbh they already did nerf melee a little bit
---
A lot of my melee weapons went from being fun toys to run around with, to being absolutely useless legendary script items.
---
I thought most vendor bots had the meat hook plan but it may be limited to a particular faction. Visit whitespring and check the inventories of the vendor bots. I'm sure you'll find the plans on one of them.
---
Can chimes, Super Duper, and Ammosmith.  Rinse, repeat.  
---
Gatlings are terrific weapons because they hit like a freight train and don't burn ammo like the .50s do (but the .50s are fun also; find an Action Hero or a 1-star Vampire .50 and you'll see what I mean).  Bear Arms in Strength at max rank will allow you to carry heavies at less weight cost than pistols.  Stabilized in Intelligence will provide a great accuracy bonus, and One Gun Army in Luck adds crippling.  I'd go max-rank in Adrenaline too, because of all the ancillary melee benefits from all the strength you'll be adding.
---
It's a Big Dumb Hero build but you can wade into high-level mobs like warm surf.  Deeply gratifying.
---
Guilty as charged, though I still hate those explosive one shot killing players in the game, so annoying.
---
I actually like the event, I just hate wasting my time cause someone wants to show off their e-penis. We had a deathclaw and a snally at FULL health - the shit's just unnecessary and wasted like 9 peoples time
---
Weapons the enemies drop with scrapper perk. You'll be swimming in steel
---
The BoS mod you are referring to is the mod I was looking for.  It was effectively 'missing' (i.e.: low probability random number generator) for months: no longer dropping, no longer on vendors.    
---
After trying unsuccessfully for several weeks in the Feb/March time frame I gave up.  Per the other comments here, it was 'fixed' in Patch 9 and should be back on vendors, specifically the one at Grafton Station.  I missed the patch note because apparently I'm a blind idiot.
---
Just hop servers and shop folks vendors. I have found lots of things for super cheap that I traded for items I wanted. Just cause folks on reddit charge 50k doesnt mean newbs do. 😉
---
There's very little optimisation needed for PvE than if you compare how minmaxed PvP builds are, yet besides highly specialized purposes such as SQB or Pylons tanking PvP builds tend to outdps PvE builds by big margin.
---
My sneaky sniper does x5 (2.5 x 2 from headshot) damage on headshots from sneak. With explosive rifle, I can score one sneak shot before I alert surrounding enemies. With vatscrit damage one, I can clear out whole area without alerting them, scoring x5 damage on each and every of my shots, essentially taking down 25 mutants in 25 shots from automated combat rifle, bloodied vats50. As I said, there is no best gun, there is only most appropriate tool for given job.
---
HEY NOW.
---
Where can I find the most enemies?
---
I think the system's already so powerful they're going to stealth nerf it in some way. I think it's hilarious that people keep begging for systems to make the exact custom legendary they want while bethesda methodically strips out and waters down legendary farming methods.   
---
It's never going to happen.
---
Yeah, Xbox, sorry.  I don't know anything about the BGS launcher on PC; I have it installed but I play almost exclusively on console.
---
The concept is coordinating. A simple communication of switching out defenders will solve this problem. But requires coordination and communication. 
---
I've been in there on teams with voice chat. We rotate. It's not a complex situation only requires communication. 
---
The shooter looter aspect is pretty boring. Ask anthem the game players. 😂
---
Tell me about it.  
---
I do not understand how the 1* AA LMG (using 308) only does about 1/2 the damage per shot of a hunting (or sniper) rifle (also using 308).
---
It’s not about the legendary it’s about event rewards. You can literally server hop and get at least  20 3 stars in an hour
---

---
All the places super mutants hang out which is many, they drop shed loads of scrapable steel.
---
I'm an idiot!
---
That's fine with me, I respect that. Some people might assume you were implying that vcrit and limb damage are better.
---
Yea i feel you. I gotta be real with you the only time you are actually going to find someone not trading is a guy with a stack of duped weapons wanting caps to resell for real cash. I found a guy who i bought a aae handmade and aae lever. He said he needed to restock on caps for his store because caps sell easier than the weapons.
---
I just crafted some, just be sure you have all of the materials, especially the stable flux.
---
Riflegaming on YouTube did it if I'm not mistaken, cant remember the results though
---
Did u do sting and things at dolly sods? When u get to 3/4 all the tadpole challenges are under world in the same place u see the atom challenges.
---
It doesn’t give the whole server food. However they made the canned meat stew never spoil so it is great for the 5% exp buff. Especially since it lasts for a full hour.
---
Well done!
---
I have a Light Machine Gun with Furious and faster fire rate, primed, if you are interested in trying the test with it.
---
For the same reason people blame Bill Gates for every problem with Windows despite the fact that he hasn't worked at Microsoft in over a decade (and hadn't written any code for over a decade prior). The Same reason why people blame Zuckerberg for every minor site redesign on Facebook. For better or worse, the face associated with the brand gets the complaints.
---
No just the food doesnt expire.
---
Lol, the first time I saw a roach open a door to leave and close it behind I pissed myself laughing. 
---
I’ve tried selling as a vendor and never had luck. Anything good I tend to hoard. I like collecting lower level weapons and pumping them out as giveaways since there is no traffic on my neighborhood to sell them.
---
What's up with the L4D voices?
---
Yeah, same. Probably bugged. (Not running a melee build though)
---
People that don't use r/market have no sense of the games economy either, and it's actually worse. 5kcap 1* bloodied weapons run rampant.  
---
No way you're finding any end game gear for a steal, which is all a lot of people accept at this point..
---
Added the Weapon issue to the Weapons page :)
---
And this is fair pricing I think. I don't see a problem with 550 but 1.5k was too much to me.
---
🙈
---
Now I think you r just whining. It can be done dude.
---
The only good battle Royale is Minecraft hunger games/ Skywars
---
I literally got a possum badge from stings and things 10 minutes ago
---
When it said habitat, I was expecting something along the lines of a larger fish tank habitat. Not shoving it into a jar, alive, and stowing it on the shelf like an old book.
---
Yeah but it's my code. I know it's fine, but I don't want to have to deal with explaining how to work it all. It was always meant as nothing more than a personal project. Either I share the 4GB dataset, or every user spends the *minimum* 14 hours computation time extracting from the game.
---
Awesome brother.   At one point this level 250 insta kill melee guy and me had a 3* and several 1s laying in the street waiting for the pain parade.   He was basically standing on top of the 3* to make sure no one one completely finished him off.   We stood there for like 5 minutes amist a sea of writhing green.  Kinda surreal.
---
Fix them and start the first camera shop in the wasteland
---
While taking a photo with your prosnap deluxe
---
he probably sold it via in-person trade, wherein you can set a price for a whole stack individually.
---
Drop them 🤷‍♀️
---
I save a few for in case they come out with more lenses but other then that....
---
I think the dagger is a good weapon.  I used it for about 20 levels as a primary, now its a backup.
---
Haven’t seen mods for it though.
---
Grafton Steel . . . for the low level super mutants.
---
I'm sure I had a Server Closing for maintenance with a 5 minute timer, definitely not 20. I was doing nothing much anyway so just went outside to make sure it was still there.
---
Thanks, I'll give it a try. Point Pleasant never drops any but I haven't been to the airport in a long time.
---
Black Waters mine, all those yummy rifles and shotguns and gauntlets will get you over encumbered in no time. Super mutants drop laser guns which are also a great source for plastic.
---
Black water mine has a ton of mole miners that drop shotguns and assault riffles for steel. Also breach and clear events will give you a good amount of ore.  Wes Tek has a ton a mutants which drop assault rifles and you can commonly find legendaries there also.
---
Also at the blackwater mine. I usually get around 200 scrap steel every time I go
---
What if, and here's a crazy thought, its about both? But thanks for defending an inconsiderate dick tho
---
Ah yeah I got it on my main from an event back in December and was surprised when I saw them in the vendor on my new character earlier lmao
---
Sounds like supply and demand working to me
---
PSA the animals out of the alpha room don’t get bothered.  You can leave them to go to the room with the alpha and they won’t die.  Everything spawns in that room only once the alpha comes.  Done it several times and it happens every time.
---
i thought so too but a couple have too many dots, misaligned dots, or are just plain not a braille letter.
---
plus its nonsense if you try decoding it as braille
---
Yeah, it's the same for adventure or survival.
---
Supply and demand would be great if the means of production wasn't furthered by a select few duping the very best equipment. Next.
---
Also use the scrapper perk card if you have it
---
While addicted to every chem in the game
---
Its a glitch. Pretty sure it because you had the item for sale in the vending machine...changed to a server where your camp couldnt be loaded. Bam too stacks.
---
But if u pull both out then they will merge again. So out of bugs not the worse one.
---
I did notice at one point when I was super overweight took me probably 2 minutes to catch up with you guys and yet everyone was just there standing and waiting for me to come get my hits in. It was amazing
---
Every damn time. 
---
My left finger is on vats auto pilot getting me mangled in the mire
---
Oh :( that's cool that it doesn't expire though!
---
It’s summer dude, go outside instead of trolling Internet forums like a weirdo
---
Would be nice to test weapons for sure 👍
---
Its not in the green zone. I checked last night to make sure, but ended up hitting WS instead. I think im gonna try it tho.  Im on xbox if anyone wants to join, but it might be a flop, lol
---
Kill super mutants. Go to the penitentiary or west trek.
---
Yeah I use it
---
lol.. 50k
---
The big bend tunnel has a bunch of scorched with shotguns, rifles, and melee weapons; and there are a few iron deposits in the basement of Garrahan Mining HQ (near to where you register your armor)
---
are the requisition drops accompanied by Vertibots? i honestly forget
---
lol I've never seen an inventory like you state and I've gotten 7 god rolls myself. Next.

It's a struggle in the wasteland, ad victoriam brother.

Well done, two things I'd never heard of LOL I'm melee with a handmade for range, I hate explosives of all kinds. I've got to the stage where I get a tightness in my chest when I hear that spat spat of TSE weapons, I fast travel away immediately.
---
Thank you all guys for the tips ! See you in apallachia !
---
The default spot is typically the middle of the circle when placing the camp, though I still don't know the full logic behind it. For example, at my old camp my friends always spawned in the middle of the circle, which was right outside my building. But I would spawn in some rocks way outside the circle (luckily I could just walk out of those rocks).
---
I wish we could just get the travel mat
---
Here’s a crazy thought. Get gud
---
It’s a duper’s world thanks to Bethesda’s inability to ban and delete.
---
You on Xbox?
---
Oh nice.
---
I said that wasnt a case where i had things for sale and also only had a load in once where I couldnt place camp and that was after not selling plans as well. So that rules that out.
---
It's at full health until it gets one-shot by the alpha :)
---
And this could be fixed by allowing player spawn may placement. But the flip side is traps people could set.

I have no idea. All I know is that if it gives you a quest to retrieve it. Then it is a player drop and you will wanted if you steal from it.
---
Huh, didn’t notice that. I guess I choose cosplay as the mistress of mystery more often and kill some bots.
---
Agreed, I found some assassins/sentinel armor and an unyielding/sentinel for less than 5k each. The vast majority of players do not trade competitively or use reddit so you can find some good deals if you check other camps. Most players don't know the value of items they sell at all. Like what was mentioned above, sometimes you get great finds and other times its overpriced junk lol
---
One thing that I recommend and is hilarious is to hang back and watch people attack the ghouls.  Many low levels are at first afraid to approach them and shoot them with their hunting rifle or whatever.   As their confidence grows they go to their melee weapon.  Then you see them go to bashing or straight dropping all weapons and punching the f’ing ghouls in the head like it’s some cathartic experience and they’re venting.....like in Office Space where an enrage Michael Bolton punches the Inotek printer.  So gd funny!!!
---
But you can't sell them boo hoo
---
They may have fixed this, I killed a Deathclaw in the Ash Heap last night and for the first time ever got a hide from its corpse.
---
Where the hell are all these nice people on console? I was trying to make steak with a 5 cap bounty and some lvl 105ish jerkoff came running over, slaughtered my ass, and proceeded to take all the junk I had on me, which included about 25ish screws, a couple of springs, and some other stuff

Question about the Musician.....  
---
Are you talking about the Play Instrument at location X?
---
Rule 4 of this subreddit prevents me from calling out other users. You're obviously not one of the average users I mention, I've got quite a few amazing rolls for my build. Im not talking about someone like you or I so im not sure why you feel attacked.
---
Hey there fellow reddit user :D
---
A single weapon that has less than a 1% chance of dropping is definitely worth 50k which you could get in a week or less if you really want it. Its to save time and effort. Dont like the prices then dont pay them.
---
Haha yeah I was mostly joking, the described phrases sound too... intentional. I knew someone who had Tourette’s, and she did swear, but it was usually one word exclamations, not coherent phrases.
---
I have 57
---
get on my level
---
So pretty much end up like a simulation of vault 68?
---
Maybe it’s plans for a tarp?
---
Because if backpacks were transferable...no one would do the grind ass challenges. 
---
And after completing them myself. I would be pissed if someone was able to buy a backpack from another player. 😑
---
No, I don't think I will, thanks.
---
This may blow your mind, but a person can criticise something, want to hold its makers to account, and *still* care about and enjoy that product. What Fallout 76 is today (and there are still a fair few issues) in no way excuses, or somehow erases, that we were sold a half-finished product just so Bethesda could have another 'announced at E3, launches in fall' moment. I'm way past seething about it, but should Howard acknowledge the troubles at this year's E3 and not try to brush it off with another 'our games are buggy, lolz' moment? Yes, he absolutely should. Because it's a sign of respect for the customer. All of us should want that.
---
I didn't see any difference when I logged in.
---
If you are on PS4, I have acid in my vending machine.
---
Go to Monongah power plant - Walk down the road to the S - It’s a short walk to my camp, which is built on a power transmission tower - at the intersection with the road where you’d turn W to go to Bolton greens
---
In addition to the other critters mentioned, Wendigo teeth scrap to acid
---
Take the workshop at the county fairgrounds up north. There are iron deposit and junk pile you can install resource units on.
---
I literally just saw somebody sell a 1* bloodied handmade for 5k. I offered 2k and then told him it wasn't worth 5k. But somebody bought it lol.
---
I got a lvl 50 instigating explosive +1 perception hunting rifle for 3k yesterday.  God rolls can be found just takes time. I’ve also got god rolls from the purveyor. It won’t happen in a weekend I’ve spent like 2k scrip on all 2 stars and have gotten maybe three great rolls and the rest nocturnal bashing damage garbage.
---
I actually think they have merit. You're most probably right in that the guys with the money are the ones making the gameplay decisions, however, making them fail with those decisions is the only way for they to change. So yeah, in a few words, if it is a battle royale, I hope it fails miserably and all they community hates it so they stop doing shit like this :) and that's where this kind of post helps.
---
First/last doesn’t matter if it multiplicative. Also I believe the chems are wrong (as they have been since FO4)- they really just add 15/25 dr, not a percent, making them fairly useless for defense. But I haven’t verified that in 76.
---
I think battle royal would be interesting. Not sure how to feel about it though. I personally love PVP but survival is way too hard due to those random mfers with perfect builds one shotting everyone under level 150
---
Legendaries are everywhere and drop the same random chance, the event is unique and has unique rewards, so no event &gt; legendary, this is one where you destroy the boss ASAP in order to win.

Jeeze the tadpole badges really aren't that hard.

Anyway, I suppose if I didn't get a high capacity plan learned through trading the plan with friends I'd be much more understanding. I don't really see much need to complete any of the other challenges now, but occasionally when I run out of stuff to do I'll go to do them.
---
Then you aren't paying attention. Next.
---
Nothing happens. For some reason it doesn’t effect the enemies on the inside. Same with the flora it doesn’t change.
---
It’s way easier from a dev standpoint to do a BR or something to allow players to create the narrative than to A: change the whole theme of the game by adding story NPCs beyond the odd robot. I think given the increased player interaction around shops people have the sorts of tools they need to build with others in less formulaic ways. PvP rule updates could in fact help you here rather than pull players or turn them off the normal mode.
---
Very nice, good to know!
---
Since when does explosive effect alert enemies? I play a sneak build as well and can clear West Tek unnoticed with an explosive sniper... I also get that extra 60% damage(crits or not) that is useful in situations where sneaking isn't plausible. Also, please explain how a tank build can out-dps a dps build?
---
Relog. And yes there is more location. I got mine under the wheel of mount blair.
---
1500 x 7 = 10,500
---
Where's the other 40,000 caps coming from? Defending the need to have multiple alts that are battle ready and capable of farming caps and legendarys is exactly the point of this topic.

It says "FREE PLANS INSIDE"
---
Not really from what I've seen. Food is good, I set up several industrial water purifiers and sell a couple hundred at a time.
---
thanks yes thats what i thougt i guess they introduced it with a patch because im sure it said serrated cultist dagger
---
Thanks for the link, cross posted the grenade data I dug up on those 2 pages.
---
I did and nothing changed
---
Still, that's not going to have any effect until after the mode comes out. Look at all the hubbub around repair kits, and it settled down almost instantly. Those who like them buy them, everybody else doesn't. Simple as that. Daily angry rants on reddit aren't going to change anybody's mind. If the mode comes out and nobody plays it, THAT's going to have an effect
---
Pro tip..check your recent players list and if its super tiny. Then there will be a maintenance on that server soon.
---
Well you are on your way to having waaay too much steel. 
---
I get around 800 scrap after 1 west tech run but there are plenty of lower level areas too
---
Grafton steel and Bog town are good
---
Free plans &amp; items?
---
My generator keeps getting pew pew’d by the super mutants and scorched spawned nearby. They don’t try to come close and pick the lock or anything, just stand a hundred meters away and pew pew, my metal walls are destroyed then goes the generator and vending. Is there a more bullet proof wall in the game? Does brick work better?
---
Sorry for the delayed response, blew up my computer by accident and it set me behind.   
---
   
---
The Fridge mod for the backpack is configured incorrectly and it allows stacking to reduce the spoilage below 90% Reduction
---
To be honest, even if I had 10k caps I wouldn’t pay that for a legendary. It just encourages the behavior. I regularly buy them for under 500 and scrap for scrip.
---
ive read this post before...
---
I am sorry to say this bro, but i did not read most of that. You're taking this way too far, and I think you should get a hobby instead.
---
Those ppl are not here on reddit. You can always pm folks to negotiate.
---
I just made like 11k rounds 2 days ago.
---
1* weapons aren't end game weapons nor a godroll. Congratulations to them for milking caps from an ignorant vault dweller I guess though?
---
I would drop the points of solar powered into something you get benefit from all day, JMO. Same for Butchers bounty, maybe concentrated fire (if you use VATS at all) or the limb damage reduction perk. Also like the other poster mentioned...mutations.
---
It'd still cost max+ caps for a god roll if duping didn't exist. It's simply far easier to hit max caps than to get the four-roll combinations that you want, even with the legendary vendor.
---
Dupers used to drive the caps prices down, but I guess the few who still know an active exploit have no need for caps anymore. They're just trying to collect the god rolls that they don't already have.
---
Ummm I sell mine for 999. Flux and ballistic fiber is costly. Good luck making them profit at 200 caps. 😂
---
My impression was it would be something where you basically use a new / different character each time. I think that could be cool honestly to just play a new character for 30mins or something. 
---
A PvP thing in 76 could potentially be really funny and entertaining, but I think PvP currently has a high barrier to entry because some people have been playing since launch and they scare me lol.
---
I definitely will buy any 3* weapons for under 800 for scrip. I continue getting awful junkie weapons though. 
---
Sooon....
---
No, happily it has stayed fixed. No more worries for a sudden unexpected overflow in the inventory at worst possible time.
---
Stop picking them up. Scrap them out of sheer because you can?
---
Well you're over priced. Maybe I don't care about profit?
---
This was brought to my attention on my Bug roundup "[Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup | Patch 9.5 | 05/21/209 Wild Appalachia - Project Paradise](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bsk7dg/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch_95/)"

Please let me know what you dig up, I'll be rebuilding my [Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup - UI, Display and Graphics - Feb 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aq1uah/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_ui/) into a maintained (and not "Date Stamped" page and this would be good info to pass on to Bethesda.
---
Call in a supply drop.
---
Yeah it's bugged. I was doing the event where you had to collect bug parts for bug repellent and  every flying bug it's 0%
---
Drinking games sounds and getting hammered sounds like it would be quite the laugh :-)
---
Go in 5 meters range of a super mutant and shoot your nonexplosive silenced gun in the air, then shoot explosive one in the air. I don't mean them being alerted of your exact position, I mean them being alerted something happens near
---
I'm ready for it lol
---
are you trying to do the weapon challenge? It doesn’t have to be a rad storm, just a storm, with another “thing” in the picture to take a picture of. It should really say “take a picture of A CREATURE in a storm.” Hell it may work on anything that will actually show up in the upper right on the camera, like red rocket sign, generators, etc.
---
I think it would be best on the rebuild of [Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup - UI, Display and Graphics - Feb 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aq1uah/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_ui/) (not Date Stamped)..   
---
Posted on the Authors page asking for updates :)
---
That did the trick - thanks!
---
Not from me though :)
---
If folks are paying it...its not overpriced. 😌
---
And good for you.
---
Yes it does
---
That's just comparing a gun with and without a silencer...
---
Thx
---
Reread my question. I did not ask if powered is equal to increase AP refresh. Not the title. The title is not the question. I ask if AP refresh is the same stat as AP regen. I also asked if it is,how much regen is per piece of armor?
---
I only finished 1 thing, collecting waste and depositing in the container
---
Just because somebody doesn't know the true value of something, doesn't mean they're not being scammed. So congrats on scamming people, you must be proud of yourself for your accomplishment :)
---
Seems to be very hit and miss for people so it must be hard for bethesda to fix I must admit. Personally the only time I ever had disconnection/crashing issues was when the infinite weight exploit was being exploited like crazy, mainly when I tried it myself. Since that has been fixed I haven't dc/crash a single time.
---
Yeah the challenge Ah good to know thanks :)
---
Its not question of hard or not. Its question of being appropriate. Its a computer game, hence, building a fusion reactor in your shack is easier in a game than its in real life. Yet somehow, its harder to obtain a backpack in this game than in real life, and that's the source of my problem - its inappropriate and immersion breaking.
---
I do the work of the Page, Bug reports, and communicating with Bethesda (Some Community Managers) as an insane solo fan.....  
---
But it's the Community that provides good information to use!     
---
Could you give me some Screenshots?   
---
There are (2) Mod slots available on the Scout Armor that are not able to be modified easily (they never added the COBJ's) and it could be a hidden upgrade (One of the slots is for different material tiers)
---
You can use the ones from the SBQ via inventory too, buying some with atoms seems like wasting atoms imo.
---
Thanks for beating me to the response!
---
On this week's inside the Vault, there is an actual list of top 10 items sold in players vending machines. Hope this helps amigo.
---
I’ve definitely seen the imminent shutdown in 20 minutes
---
Nah, that wasn't my point. The point was that I caught on quickly to how dependent this event is on other people. I consider my characters pretty strong but I straight cant do even one of the objectives alone, let alone all 3 at once. That means if you want this event to succeed perfectly for max rewards you need on the level of 6-8 people depending on how capable and coordinated they are. 
---
The point of bringing up 2/3 is that I haven't even attempted the event unless it looks like it'll be successful and since release I've only seen that scenario pop up 3 times and one of those I was wrong.
---
as long as the redund is atom points. they dont refund $$$.
---
It doesn’t drop if you miss and hit dirt, I tested that a while back (I was testing with health damage on another player, basically got the same results as you). I don’t know if it resets if you hit a new target.
---
Did I just read "Lower the 3* legendary spawn rate to compensate"?
---
usually go for half the price it says they are worth
---
I've gotten both with my level 20 character. Seemed random.
---
Why not do a search on reddit and see what folks charge before you make accusations on others.
---
You are not a saint.
---
Not when you have a deathclaw a snally and put it into easy mode.
---
I've found those and shovels lying around random farms
---
Well...thats lame. Thanks for the responces tho. Now idk what to nuke.....
---
I love BR games but fallout 76 PvP itself is so weird and sluggish i can't imagine it being any fun. I hope it isn't BR as well.
---
Woodchucker seems to double kindling, so that helps too
---
Do you have a PC that you could use to run some network tests? I know you say other games don't have any problems but that doesn't mean there isn't one. It is very possible fallout 76's netcode is a lot more sensitive to small issues like occasional dropped packets and it might be something you CAN fix.
---
The super common ones I give away for free. Super rare I put at 10% off. Everything else about 50% off.
---
I'm concentraded mostly on immersion aspect of this issue. I think if the basic backpack was ugly but functional, and all the cool looking ones were unlocked by quests, this would be perfect situation, giving appropriate themed rewards for dedication and something to show off.
---
At the same time I believe something as basic as backpack simply does not fit the purpose here. In real life transferring the ownership of a backpack, as well as teaching how to use it, is a process that takes few seconds. Non-tradable items should be unique and have a meaning. Thats my point.
---
Is it pretty obvious to see a storm in the distance? And is it confirmed just rad storm or any storm with a picture of an enemy?
---
Get a silenced explosive, silencer does nothing for them.
---
I've noticed they updated the UI. If someone has a mic plugged in, they get a black speaker by their name. If no mic there just isn't one there. But once they click it on it turns white and of course you can hear them
---
There totally is.... maybe not as big as max level... But I am one of those players looking for low level kick ass gear.
---
You can't ever sell to the vendor, you gotta use the exchange machine.
---
I just tried this with a stopwatch, all four of them clocked in at exactly 86 swings in 60 seconds.
---
This is awesome. A scroll text with damage? Or a log in the computer?
---
Because it can shoot a million times faster?
---
Ok so I am in a nuke zone an have take a picture of a protecton. Not complete the challenge
---
I have checked the data several times with no luck, but I've personally seen it in-game at the Travel encounter near Abbie's Bunker, and also at one of the Whitespring Assault locations.
---
There's a cage with a deathclaw in it south east of the pumpkin house that worked for me just a few days ago. Maybe it's that spot that's bugged?
---
I never said I was. 
---
And you said it yourself "it's not over charging if people are paying for it". That's faulty logic on your part. Just because you can doesn't mean you should. It wasn't an accusation by the way; based on what I'm seeing and your own words: it's fact.
---
You can't scrap them either!
---
Or maybe blocking at the right time, or crouching for the non marsupials.
---
That would be pretty cool.
---
K then off to dolly sods you go. Then revive a friend. Then start your tadpole challenge grind.
---
Oh. I’m dumb 🤦‍♀️😆 Thank you!!!
---
I wish they would do more pve and normal quests  instead of pvp. I really enjoyed the story and side quests in fallout 4, but in 76 the story is really short and there was not really a conclusion. And there aren’t a lot of good side quests either.
---
I farm the queen pretty regularly, so I knew I'd be getting improved kits. So I didn't buy any regular ones. I approve of the improved repair kits. They are extremely convenient and I don't have to scrounge to find the materials just to repair my weapon.
---
Yeah they must know that there is a lot of people who play the game that don’t give a flying fuck about pvp. 
---
When I first heard of a multiplayer fallout I thought playing fallout with friends, cool. Playing fallout pvp...no thanks
---
Who cares about public opinion? If they’re not playing the game by now, they most likely never will, let them rag on it. This “public” you speak of couldn’t care any less about FO76 than they already do. 
---
Why are you so concerned with how it looks to the public? Bethesda isn’t. They know what they’re doing, market research tells them all they need to know. A battle royale mode won’t change any perception of what FO76 is or isn’t.
---
I never get boomers hotel mission either, yet any time I'm in ash heap I get carnival missions at Camden's. Sometimes if I Steve hop I still get them! I don't know what happened other then I moved my camp from across the hotel and then it stopped popping up. Tried moving it back and nothing since the last two updates. Maybe it's a bug I dunno, but I'm in the same boat.
---
I'm going to E3 so I'll let you know.
---
This would be really nice. I've been doing some testing. Super mutie behemoth (south of solomon's pond) and watoga robots are alright testing targets. But firing ranges would be so much easier.
---
Oh didn't realize that. I'll def not pick anymore up then.
---
Go under challenges/world/tadpole and start tracking the various tasks you want to do for the badges.
---
You've swayed me. Boss 3* could potentially always drop as long as all 3*s don't.
---
Frankly I'd like a 3* TSE Drill. ;)
---
Interesting. I always thought that food buff ap regen was the same as the perks. I have notice that when I have powered armor on I have a shorter time before my AP starts regening. The more pieces of armor the quicker it regens because of this, I decided not to use the action boy/ girl perk. So I can opt for more damage.
---
I still think it would be best if boss looting just applied to anybody who participated in the event. Having a boss at the end of an event is rewarding not only by getting a legendary but because we want that challenge. But since they're intent on giving us so many defense quests with flimsy targets that require a level of cooperation this game's playerbase does not possess, there will always be people losing out because of those who prioritize only their own gain
---
I remember I joined the "Hunter/Hunted" and killed this one kid who kept fucking screaming because I was killing him and had to explain to his dad that he joined the PvP radio lol.
---
Real boomer hours
---
Combat should have a higher sustained DPS, especially with an armor piercing magazine.
---
For such a huge download make sure you have enough free contiguous space on the drive, I guessing at 50gb for the download, a further 70gb or so for the uncompressed install and a further 50gb for temp files during install for use by the OS.
---
I have before installing and downloading Fallout 76 150gb+ free contiguous space to make sure things don't get clogged up. Never had any problems and have reinstalled a couple of times.
---
K you didnt search....
---
Nah man it's really not that bad you gotta do like 3 badges then your golden. There are guides to how easy this stuff can be. Let me mention I'm still only talking about the tadpole challenges. The other possum challenges are much more difficult but are actually quite immersive. 
---
You just joined the scout's and have to prove yourself. Build a generator, kill enemies in rail 
---
Roads, hack computers, you can literally do most this stuff just by playing the game.
---
Honestly, just pump up the amount of .308 you can make at a time to 48 (86 with Ammosmith) and it'll be fine.
---
i had a similar experience a couple of weeks back. after doing the wendigo gormonds cage thing. when i got dc'd from server.
---
relogged and lost everything.
---
If you're in need of a hitman, you can call on me.
---
The reason why it's hard to get a really good melee is because melee isn't really good at pvp and pvp is mostly the reason for the pricing. And so people mainly dupe ranged weapons. Probably 95% of all god rolls on the market are duped weapons.
---
That's true, but looking at ammo consumption it does suck up ammo
---
What's your in game name?
---
How do you know they're shutting a server down as opposed to it crashing?
---
Its a market, if everyone sell stimpaks from 15-30 caps and you sell them 100 you wont sell(in the long run), but People need to know what the range of prices are for certain items, wich the Only reference for this are other players and game vendors, that is why you see some discusión on prices
---
I've put up something along those lines (ho-ho) but mine is a railway signal box and some storage huts.
---
If it’s brought up they will acknowledge quickly and move on to the recent additions and the rest of the road map. You don’t get more customers by dwelling on your failures.
---
I would appreciate that 🙂
---
But to be fair, a cap per shotgun shell is already cheap for me and my 1 charisma 😜
---
Theres still the death blossom event that gives everyone stuff.
---
While not perfect, ((but not sure if it would be possible to prevent leechers,)) I fully support this. I've accidentally 1 shotted Legendaries before, so that 100% chance of loot for everyone would be nice.
---
My memory us killing me.  I think I was thinking about the old prices.  Then again I may get that wrong.  My friend has light up letters, not the neon ones though.  I could ask him where he got those if you are looking for light up alternatives.
---
Download is nearly at 50gb and I funnily enough, have 76gb left, do you reckon that'll be enough?
---
Only problem I see with this, is corpses despawning immediately after death ((Not leaving a meat pile)). If they ever fixed that, this would work just as well.
---
^ this
---
You’re not alone, I also prefer to buy the guns I want instead of endlessly try to obtain them from luck based drops.
---
Vending is a blessing.
---
Not talking about discussions. Talking about people jumping on a soap box and stating I am right in my pricing and you are wrong. 
---
Who cares if they don't sell the stimpacks. Maybe they don't want to sell all of them but are willing to make a few 100 caps if someone is desperate for a few. I definitely price certain things in my vending at make me sell it prices. These are items I am using and don't necessarily want to sell but if you will pay me more than it's worth, I will.
---
Yeah you gotta do it a few times and much like the level up, its one that appears daily
---
Even more in some cases. I mean you craft 5mm by the hundred. It'll never be worth 1c each to me and probably never .2c when I can buy the materials for much less.
---
Haha I was joking but its philis401.  I do put a free supply fillup vendor just fyi.  im on pc tho.
---
:)
---
Even paper/metal targets that give a damage feedback. I'd love to know how much damage my lever action does on it's "instigating" shot vs a regular shot vs a critical shot vs a critical instigating shot.
---
It’s so cramped it’s arms are crossed in frustration
---
Maybe they will if they’re happy
---
Thats exactly whats happening lol
---
If your fine with making a few more rounds go with combat otherwise go with pump
---
if it is, it'll be a case of the fearther that broke the camel's back. it's be both stupid and annoying to a lot of people
---
That’s amazing! Thanks for doing the research!
---
I can see your side, for me the thing is how some items and such are special because they're rare, that means some people, like it or not, will never find one of whatever. If everything is obtainable, even if it just takes hours of grinding, then nothing will be special, because literally everyone will have access to the same thing.
---
There is high risk that this post will be heavily down voted.
---
Server hop.
---
I agree with the let peeps play thr way they wanna play.  There are more than ine player vendors, and if all else fails you can always map hop.
---
Can you drop them for other people though..? If so ask in here if anyone needs one..?
---
Source?
---
I think, if I remember correctly, when Todd Howard was asked if there would be battle royal he just said "we'll see" or something along those lines
---
I feel you don’t know much technically judging by your comment. I love how you so vaguely lay out how easy this would be for the devs without actually supplying any real tangible solution for doing it other than ‘ oh yeah that’s easy just make a function, duh’. Gawd.
---
Look up basically anything in regards to nuclear winter update
---
There is indeed, if you don't have a op melee user in the team, you do need to prioratise the bugs!
---
I know...it's really sad. I don't force anyone into PvP. It's part of the game and pretty much the whole point of survival but I still have people screaming down the Mic on survival...it's so confusing
---
Welcome to the World of retail.
---
Imo - i can't understand someone who complain about prices of others. 
---
Sure i also encountered one shop so far were i tought "oh well...good luck sell it" but i would never freak out about it. 
---
If the prices are too high, go to other vendors. Plain and simple.
---
I'm down for fishing
---
7
---
I am level 129.
---
The last 200 times it was posted.
---
I'm actually a melee player primarily first but I'm a melee tank, not a bloodied build. So I can take a hit or two from the Alphas unless I have specific armor effects (I have two Hunter's on at all times so I can take a lot more hits from the Sheepsqautch). I especially can take more hits if I block or power attack as I am getting hit (My Axe has the 40% reduced damage while power attacking effect).
---
While I agree with your distain for ridiculously high prices. The means to production isn’t controlled by dupers it’s Bethesda. If anything dupers have worked to increase supply.
---
That affects everybody equally though. Not saying it shouldn't get fixed immediately, but it doesn't necessarily relate to the issue at hand
---
I've found a living Alien, not a Flatwoods Monster... But if I am wrong, then so be it.
---
I wonder why they did that. Like, everyone has been asking for MORE FT mat usability, so now it has none?
---
I know I had some fun early on when survival was introduced plus 100k caps i earned, but now i don't see much reason to go there sadly.
---
There is no confirmed info from Bethesda about it being PvP. It clearly states things like vault raids, player updates etc... are you referring the the data mined rumours about a battle royal mode? which is a awefull idea by the way.
---
That'z awezome!
---
That was 1 of my 2 options i mentioned. Thanks
---
i have 210 that i can spent i am lvl 370
---
Why? They gave you a ton of free DLC content with more on the way. What else do you want? Do you think Todd owes you an apology and a back rub?
---
It works. 😉
---
PvP is worthless as it stands, we shall see if Bethesda can pull a non borked rabbit out of the hat.
---
Course as the track record shows it's got the same chance as the SBQ dropping mutation recipies currently.
---
Don't get me wrong, PvP can and is great on games that are designed for it from the start with PvP being the main focus. But not games that try and Ballance pve/PvP (unless split servers and split code for each type of server).
---
I am aajor PVE player but I do play some PvP, course I expect to die and to suck at it so I go in prepared for frustrations and toil. But to each their own. I'm not dissing PvP players or 0ve players. This is just my opinion. I hope it all works out in the end
---
Boo hoo hooo
---
Mules. You need at least one mule to have 50k caps anyway. You can have 4 miles and 1 main on an account.
---
It's not PvP, it's "survival" mode, which is actually adventure with limited "griefing" restrictions....it's not PvP.
---
You are only alloted a certain amount of Perk points.  You stop getting them after lvl 50
---
I have done it before, you just need to put the slanted roof first
---
8 level 116
---
That's special points, not perk card points.
---
It's not a provenethod. But if they have a shop up. Why not just nuke it?
---
Can you point me in the direction of nuclear winter info as I can't find anything about it being PvP heavy
---
The hell I don't look it up on youtube
---
Yeah after the last patch I strolled into springs and golfers were everywhere. Got so excited to kill them and then got hit with the most anti climax reward ever after waiting so long.
---
That’s fine. You’re free to be a whiny baby about problems that occurred during the release of a video game months ago. To be perfectly honest, I’m not sure you deserve an ounce of respect with your attitude.
---
I doubt it, it's a raider arm and agi/AP refresh is preferred over end
---
It’s my understanding that the Brahman can be damaged/killed by friendly fire.  So people may want to put away their explosive weapons, and use VATS if engaging an enemy that’s very close to the Brahman...
---
Currently level 24, trust me. It’s not waste... yet.
---
6 I'm level 240
---
I hope so. I have no problem with there being 2 modes like it is now and they completely remove all PvP from adventure...As log ad they fix survival then there no issues for people who really don't want to do PvP
---
If it's max level:
---
Heavy raider goes for 25k+ or trade only.
---
Lighter versions run around 15k
---
Yup, that and the "don't kill anything until the entire server tags it first".....fick that sheit.
---
Can we test Explosive laser weapons and the burn damage from gamma vs beta tuners?
---
Violet
---
Not mad, just disappointed.
---
I mean, if we're talking about people missing out on Loot it's entirely related. It doesn't bother me when it happens, but you see people on here constantly saying how unfair it is on people who contributed a lot.
---
Alright
---
You fairy...
---
Sweet! I'll check it out. Your camp is really nice btdubs
---
Can't help with a controller, but I had the same issue with falling through the world yesterday. Except I wasn't wearing power armor and got stuck in a loop falling until I died. And my junk was stuck a solid 10 feet under the world :)
---
I agree separate them and fix each as a stand alone. Most problems would go away.
---
In what way is adventure different from survival apart from less PvP restrictions
---
I want something similar to Home Base from FO4
---
I kid. I do miss the simpler challenges also
---
I always get the existing objects message unless I glitch it, so I don’t know how you could’ve managed.
---
If the corpse disappears instantly, that's going to hurt the people fighting it just as much as people defending on the other side of the area
---
At the tent village shop behind Vault-tec University there is always a bucket with 4 in it.
---
Too much effort. I just want the annoying people to leave. I had about 10 people at my camp yesterday and out of the blue this asshat shows up and starts shooting everyone. Eventually people who were waiting to buy left because they were annoyed. I was forced to server hop because this dude wouldnt take the hint. I had to block/report this dude as he followed me to 3 different servers and kept making vulgar comments to me.
---
Assault rifles, kill super mutants and scrap them.
---
I'm level 170, 365 hours played. I've killed like 10 dudes, and they were either: Griefing lower levels, trying to grief me. PvP in this game is/was WAY too gimmicky. (Sentinel+cavalier+bloodied) Gettting 1 shotted is never fun.
---
Idk, I also have gotten foundations into extractors so idk if I am just lucky
---
Todd will say that he read in internet about fo76 having some bugs
---
I get that. Dupers unfortunately ruined that for us. I have a hard time believing the amount of god rolls we see pass through the market are all legit and its sad. Not to mention all the ones you hear about on ebay and other sites being sold for real cash.
---
I've seen other mmo games that have rare special gear that are hard to earn and retain that exclusiveness even though the ability to earn them remains.
---
 I'm not talking hours of grand I'm talking weeks. Maybe a rare token drop that allows us to change an attribute?
---
Personally I just think the end game is too luck based and ends up making some things lopsided.
---
It won't stop real world trading and wouldn't stop dupers they will always appeal to those with time restraints or people who want quick instant gratification.
---
I'd like some sort of middle ground. While I been lucky to buy or find what I want for my build I'd like for us to all have some sort of level endgame.
---
Make the cosmetics rare like the coats people love from that one trader or the paints from the technical documents and so on. I also enjoy the randomness of open world loot like magazines being random.
---
Maybe a super hard long expensive grind and still have the chance a legendary could drop that god roll?
---
I'd don't know what or how they could make a change honestly. Its just an idea. But even if the most of the community don't want it that way and they never change it that's fine. I'm okay with appealing to the masses.
---
I'd be a little happier with the legendary system if the legendary always drops relative to your level. And if the enemy is 3 star then always drop a 3 star.
---
I actually hit two mole rats at once, 1 time. Super happy but never happened again.
---
In what way? I was followed by a guy for 3 servers. I was clearly being targeted. How does hopping help in that aspect?
---
I'm hoping Nuclear Winter ends up being similar to Adventure Mode except theres nukes, nukes everywhere!
---
So because you've never experienced a few people that found an exploit it doesn't exist? I guess because i've never experienced people duping that didn't exist either, right? Bethesda even admitted people could become invincible and permanently invisible. That why they fixed that exploit. It's right in the patch notes. My logic is doing things and figuring out work arounds the game didn't intend are exploits. Funny that Bethesda agrees and keeps addressing these issues. TSE weapons actually worked exactly as they were designed so that isn't an exploit. If you want to try to sound condescending by using terms like, "by your logic," then please actually use my logic.
---
Really...hmm scare the AI harder...nope...Do you take more damage in general ...nope...is the base game any different at all...nope...the only different is less PvP restrictions therefore it is obvious designed at PvP players.....
---
Wow, only you could sell them you might have a few hundred more caps 🤣
---
Not a 20k+, it would have to be specific buyers who outbid. If it serves as an estimate, I recently bought an unyielding cavalier raider arm for 5k
---
Xbox through the xbox profile then server hop. They only following you because they can. They are join via your gamertag. 🙈
---
I bought 6 basic ones. In a couple of occassions lacked materials to repair something and used them.
---
I understand the pay to win argument.....would be better if they were dropped by mobs or quest rewards.
---
You can only try, make sure anything important is backed up just in case things don't go well. The download is 50gb and the install will end up at around 70 so you may be pushing it, considering the OS needs free space to run and temporary file space during install.
---
I don't know how Bethesda Installer works, maybe it will not use that much more space during install.
---
Good luck.
---
Word thanks everyone!
---
Just make mobs drop loot for all event participants, like it's happening if you are in team, doesn't matter who kill mob every team member nearby can loot it.
---
They were hostile. They were shooting at me and we were killing each other. Lol. Of the half dozen people involved it was only 2 that vats never worked on no matter what. Vats worked on the other 4 without any issues.
---
Get all the sneak perks and full set of unyielding. Easy game then, nobody will hear or see you coming.
---
Idk if this will work or not, but have you tried going to the terminal where you spawn more Chiefs and trying that?
---
Crouching during a semi-earthquake... sounds like a plan!
---
14 I'm lvl 157
---
Yes. It just says they’re inactive and doesn’t let me spawn them.
---
Bethesda actually said the game sold quite well. Well enough in fact a whole year of updates has been planned and developed and new things continue being made and added to the game constantly. I'm not concerned about the public either. I enjoy the game, I don't need other people's approval to validate that.
---
Haha same, well two and lvl 140 but similar. Plus only once in every couple of weeks do I get someone trying to start PvP but it's not my bag so I leave them whack me a few times while I go afk to get a drink or whatever lol
---
Is there a way I can force launch prep to restart completely?
---
Hey thanks! TheTrueIndiz helped me out with some black titanium and a few other things, I think I’m going to try and get the mods together myself. Thanks for the link to the post telling me where I could get them though! Will be super helpful!
---
The ones in 4 are Vertibirds. Vertibots are a new introduction I believe, totally unmanned and the on board computer and power source takes too much room to allow for passengers.
---
Or i can just keep kicking them from my camp. Eventually they will be tired of losing caps, fast traveling to the nearest location to walk to my camp.  Yup, that seems smarter and less work on my part.
---
Paper or metal targets that have different parts to target in VATS would be pretty dope. Maybe even make a "PING!" Noise when you get a crit. I'm thinking camp objects: Super mutant cut-outs, clay pigeons, vault boys, even cans. Each one could be set to mimic different enemy resistances too!
---
I'm imagining people (me) building pretty intense navy seal-esque "kill houses" out of their camps. Maybe you could pair it with some sort of a "test drive" option for weapon purchases. Maybe you get 5-min worth of play time with the gun, it won't degrade, but also will only damage paper/metal targets. (So no running off, completing an event, then running back. No damage to AI or players during the test drive).
---
Ammo would need to either be infinite for the duration or vicinity of the firing range, or at the guest's own expense.
---
Last free idea Bethesda:
---
You pair this with a "Gun Runners Arsenal" type of DLC that brings back everyone's favorite weapons. R91, Anti-Materiel, Bozar, *That Gun*, etc. You could even sell weapon skins for said "legacy" (meaning from previous games) guns for atoms, or sell the targets for atoms as well. I'd pay you money for that in a heartbeat!
---
Where are my goddamn mounted mega sloth heads??
---
Friendlies npcs in events can not be hurt by players. Do your own research before telling everyone this please. Tired of seeing people that think explosive weapons are the reason they fail events.
---
No you can't, everyone need to server hop themselves for tourist body.
---
Zero at 177... I play solo alot and like to mess around with guns I'm not maxed for so I burn up perks for everything.
---
That happened to me once, i just let one of the enemies kill the chief and then i made another one with the terminal. Try finding an enemy or just wait a little longer and make them follow you to the chief.
---
Getting caps is so easy, thats why most people would rather trade for top tier items. A lot of people can get to max caps by selling one good weapon or armor
---
I feel this is what the Tesla rifle was born to do, tag mobs so you're not missing out on legendary items or exp
---
Too funny. Spot on accurate IMO. But still funny.
---
Congrats on trolling people. Piss off and ESAD.
---
I also had this issue, and hope this helps anybody else having the issue. 
---
Every time I tried to enter the National Radio Astronomy Research Center, the game crashed and closed out to my Xbox home screen. I was doing the “One Of Us” quest for MODUS in The Whitesprings Bunker. I’m on Xbox One for what it’s worth.
---
I tried front and back doors at NRARC, both crashed.
---
I tried with and without power armor equipped, still crashed.
---
I tried with and without the quest active, still crashed.
---
I tried clearing the cache (unplugged power for 10min), still crashed.
---
I went to a different interior location (The Whitesprings Resort) to see if other interiors would load. Loaded fine at Whitesprings. Went back to NRARC, and was able to enter the building without crashing.
---
Hope this helps!
---
Ah... then scrap...
---
He’s dead, but it still says “Section Chiefs (1/1)”
---
Duping brings the prices down.. TSEs at one point went for 1k. Now theyre finally rising to the 10k range
---
So on board with this.   To have this, and be able to hook a terminal up to it, and change the enemy type and armor level of the range target would give me a gamegasm.
---
Are you complaining about the econ or your inability to buy duped melee weapons? I'm getting some mixed messages over here.
---
Sure.....
---
So how do you screw with perk points?
---
I wanted to run a melee build but hit reg being broken 90% of the time was a huge killer. They'd be on my screen, and the attack connected and should've hit, but it doesn't. Takes me right out of the game tbh.
---
I get it, he had a frog habitat at his camp and you mistook it for pepe. This is just unsubstantiated garbage.
---
99% sure the answer is no.  Really not good for much, except for helping players initiate pvp against you.
---
At least now you can sell canned stew in your camp because it doesn't spoil :) I'm buying those of someone is selling cheap it gives nice amount of food and water.
---
If you are going straight PA adamantium is a waste Bc Pa negates limb damage
---
I've only killed one person, for the same reason, but after vending machines hit the game and trap rooms became popular, I've taken to dropping orbital strike beacons inside trap rooms. Have fun using my lootbag to repair your camp.
---
I won't lie, I wouldn't be against a fallout themed Battle Royale. It could see it being pretty fun. As long as it's just an additional game mode, and pve isn't ignored. It could be fun. If it's not, it'll die off and the focus will be back on the core game.
---
I've never had that problem, it still sounds like you may not have known about the changes. Best of luck.
---
catch 100 fish after being filled up on fish whilst having a specific fish related buff, with nothing but sushi in your inventory
---
I bought the 5 pack and still have 1 left. bought it to use as a backup when weapons bench location might not be known and the need is immediate. I usually repair to the max level of Weapons Artisan so the kits are inferior except for the 'emergency' use...
---
I for one could see myself playing a battle royale game, made by Bethesda, set in the Fallout universe. *If* that game used id Tech 7. *Maybe* even if it used the id Tech 6 / Saber3D -hybrid engine used by Quake Champions. Both being game engines Bethesda could in theory get access to.
---
Not with this engine though. I'm happy with the Creation Engine for single player shooter action, even co-op stuff, but it's not suitable for a competitive shooter.
---
In my personal, and very humble opinion, it would be a massive mistake trying to use the Creation Engine for any kind of actually serious competitive shooter purposes. And, I honestly can't see them trying to go that route. Maybe I'll be proven wrong on that.
---
I did Free Range solo yesterday it was wonderful every Brahmin survived with almost full health. It was actually easier without other players.
---
Yea those types of beings are \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*. But the only thing you can do it record it via console/pc dvr, bock and report. But yeah intitles 7 year olds should not be playing.
---
oh cool i had no idea thank you for letting me know. anything els?
---
Did u go to the terminal?
---
Just play the god damn game and find out for yourself. There’s already a million of these types of posts on this sub daily ffs.
---
What level are you? I feel like this is obvious if you've gotten past level 50.
---
Another day, another bug
---
Yeah. That one asshole who nukes low-level zones on youtube to 'see what happens" already did it, and nothing.
---
Never got past it, someone sold me the plan on here :(
---
It just works.
---
Nah, dont really pay attention.  I might be missing something here.  Im lvl 81 though
---
I agree that they should be transferable
---
What you’ve addressed is spot on- throughout the FO series line, it has always been about immersion and backstory, and Bethesda has done a great job at it. And frankly, they have been supportive of the player community who embrace this. 
---
Now it seems as though they’re going all in on the market grab of which no one in the community really even want
---
Junkies is one of the best effects.
---
What system are you on?
---
You keep getting points after level 50 and you can use them to buy new perk cards or move your special points budget around.
---
I did it solo yesterday. I do not have a one-shot build took forever and a lot of stims to kill Sheepsquatch and every Brahmin survived. I enjoyed the challenge.
---
Then what would be the point of the atom shop? This post makes no sense. One person per console could buy something, post it on here, and make every sale obsolete
---
Nah, we can't even resell a hard copy game anymore.  Ts part of the game so no.
---
32 on my level 148 alt
---
Besides restricted fast travel, nothing.  Which is why it's disappointing.
---
The person you are replying to has a point though.  The lower pvp restrictions were meant to make player interactions uncertain and dangerous.  They were not meant to be played as FallNite.
---
I do hope Nuclear Winter has a Thunderdomeish arena the hardcore pvpers can play in.  That would be acceptable battle royale.
---
PSA:  In the basement of Van Lowe- where the assaultron was being made there is a cart in which a static wolf corpse is in there and it counts, just did it myself
---
Update made changes thanks to EeMSs507
---
0% chance they could integrate karma into the game
---
Exactly, bethesda revenue stream would be gone and then they would probably have to start charging for additional content, as opposed to releasing it for free like they have been.
---
This is false. I always use a tesla gun which arcs through the brahmin and kills the mobs. Those brahmin would have been long dead if this were the case. Explosive weapons are fine as well.
---
I just hit level 50 last night. Someone launched a nuke and I decided it was time to wander into a nuke zone. I gear up, stop by a vendor and buy a bunch of stimpacks, and walk into the zone
---
Server crashes. 
---
I log back in and my character now has no aid items what so ever. Instant rage.
---
0 at 232.  Spend them on alternate perk sets, and single perks of cards that had been maxed out.  For instance, 1x of the rifleman perks instead if my original 3x of each.  
---
Just now getting the full auto weapon cards.
---
Only if they keep there resources unlocked will i repair anything.
---
Bloodied? Could you explain what that is?
---
The cave opposite Hopewell cave, that’s where I got mine.
---
Some guy found him slightly north of the overseer's camp, it was a post on this subreddit so you probably could find it.
---
You really *want* the Atom Store?
---
To be real 5k caps is equal to 3 days playing the game casually, getting bloodied handmade one star can take months for casual players.
---
walk up to the fire and hit the action button when prompted?
---
Run to the trees and pick up kindling there are quest markers showing you where to go on your hud
---
Dead deathclaws at the fissure site count for the challenge.
---
How do you keep the game running and DLC for free? With magic money?
---
Yes I bought 2 thought might come in handy when need a quick repair. Not used them and then got lots more from sbq.
---
Way too late for this OP, but I get where your coming from.
---
I think the next 2 waves after NW will be PvE and/or Main Story if I've heard correctly, so a little PvP side content won't be that bad. Also from what I've heard it may not just be Battle Royale, could be Deathmatch and other stuff so there's variety.
---
Impossible since you don't make any actually descions playing the game your just told we're to go with you have no dialogue
---
&gt;I'm pretty sure about 90% of people playing 76 are more into the pve and story related stuff.
---
That's because the current PvP stuff sucks; the people who bought the game for the PvP drama Todd Howard talked about quit shortly after realizing he was full of it.
---
Bethesda already has the PvE fans playing, considering how they halfassed things trying to expand the player base at launch, I think it's far more likely that Bethesda will continue to release small content updates to keep the PvE fans placated, and focus the major changes on trying to bring in new players.
---
Why do you think that? I mean if they cant do that than wouldnt factions be out of the question as well.
---
You're quite welcome!
---
This...alot.
---
Wasn't working? Bugged?
---
I will try this thank you
---
Same with the enclave presidency
---
Pick up the dry kindling from the trees the quest points you to—only the dry kindling. Then go to the fire and push the button to add it.
---
I would love Bone Raider variants of T-45d and T-51b Power Armor!
---
The problem with battle royal is that all the time spent working on your build and weapons is wasted because you start the match with nothing. If I wanted to play fortnite I would bit I don't so I play fallout
---
I hope that is one of the changes introduced with the new gameplay modes, along with the factions.
---
But it's a really faint hope.
---
To be fair I've never spent any real money in the Atom Store, just earned atoms.
---
Depends on the type/level. I don't have it handy at the moment. I'm bad about remembering haha.
---
1v1 me and say that, you got xbox?
---
I meant cave not cage
---
This stuff right here is another reason to not implement. The problems with pickpocketing will outweigh the benefits, and the only behavior it encourages is a toxic pvp power hierarchy that already has enough problems in Survival Mode.
---

---
And I'm trolling people. Right. Have a good one pal 👍😎
---
Yeah. I could give no less of a fuck about battle royale. But I recognize I'm not every player, and some people will probably enjoy it. If it keeps griefers from fucking with pve even a little bit, it'll improve pve.
---
I'll probably jump in and check it out, but I'm expecting I won't care for it much.
---
Just FYI, you can come join us on r/fo76stores to promote your store!
---
Yeah, at the object random encounter above the overseer's camp
---
The challenges used to be a challenge. Going around the map looking for specific rare items, killing certain enemies, maybe doing one of the above while wearing a certain hat. The level up (3/3) is extremely annoying, not all of us high levels have the time to get 20k exp in one day and then kite around the last enemy so we can put on some christmas stockings and equip a protest sign while drinking expired milk before getting the last bit of xp
---
You ever kill another player? Take someones workshop? Actions in this case would be the dialogue. But dont base it off of the other games base it off of what we have in 76 to work with. Like teaming up with strangers or lower levels and helping others quest and defending there workshops events.
---
You can play 5 characters, if you focus on caps it's a bit over an hour to earn 8k caps per day, you can bump it up by selling ammo and other stuff in player vending. To clarify I'm not talking about separate mule account, just 5 characters you are allowed to play on one account.
---
I am 100% for this and I’m a high spender of FO76, even on the atomic shop. I want more interaction with people. I hate that there’s no community hub, so this could work if implemented correctly.
---
The event rewards are why most people do it. Why would you run this event if your not interested in the rewards? Do you really need that 3 or 5 scrip that bad?
---
So many people don’t actually read and absorb information in this game. 
---
These same people cry that the game has no story.
---
Np one tip if you pick up wet kindling it spawns mons aim for the dry kindling but that's not always possible
---
Unarmed getting double buffed doesn't really matter when you get one shot by an explosive handmade.  Unarmed and melee are unbalanced, but that's mostly against them because they can't benefit from legendaries, in the same way, someone standing still with a rifle can.
---
Unless you're saying you want them to balance it like real life, where an unarmed build will always lose to a ranged build? In that case, I disagree with you wholeheartedly, but you are right, it's not balanced like that right now, it's still possible to sneak up on someone and one hit them if they don't have their exploit-full god-mode PvP set on.
---
Here's what the events usually are nowadays:
---
Level up while fulfilling three arbitrary conditions
---
Finish a specific event while wearing a specific costume
---
The third one tends to be more random
---
Take a picture of a blue moon while a werewolf is fisting the scorchbeast queen in a nuke zone at 3am
---
Take a picture of a player taking a picture of said orgy while the player is simultaneously engaged in pvp while naked
---
35 lv 287... yea, they become useless past a certain point.  Just letting em build up now.
---
I would like this mode to be a harder version of adventure mode, replacing all normal and low level mobs with high level / hard / rare mobs.
---
It could be something like a new chapter after original story, where Appalachia reflects the effects of so many nukes launched by us, making changes to fauna, flora, enemies, even food and rad, added new quests and events.
---
All geared towards high end.
---
After all, last new mode was a pvp one, so a harder / endgamish pve mode would make sense
---
Glad to hear about the chemist one. 
---
As far as the pics of vertibots and cargobots then perhaps it's just my camera. I know the name has to be in the frame. I've done all the other photo challenges. The only time I could get a vertibot to register was by taking a workshop and lining up directly in front of it while it was on the repaired helipad. 
---
Cargobots I only see flying so no shot at that. I just think they need to examine the size of the "hit box" (whatever your call it) they have for photos on those two things.
---
&gt;two other high level of all trades
---
What does this mean?
---
Oh I'm on Xbox I would have given you my lab coat I'm sorry you're having bad luck I hope you can get the coat and backpack soon
---
Didn't even get bear arms...I also completed today and thought I got shafted until I checked my weapons inventory.
---
My problem is that I simply can't believe how its possible that somebody is able to hack computers but can't wield a backpack without proper initiation rituals :D
---
Alight! Got my Storm Pic. It was of a bunch of ghouls/wendigo while in a **regular** storm. Got lucky!
---
Hey if enough people want this bethesda will give it to us......eventually
---
OMG
---
I thought the robot was bugging out by standing on the fire and preventing us from clicking it.
---
Well if you have brahmin in PP you have other issues
---
That's another thing this game should borrow from Division 2. That one has a shooting range in the basement, and it's fantastic. It has 4 sections (damage test, damage test vs normal/veteran/elite/named with a toggle, so you can see how much damage you do to different enemy tiers, moving target test, multiple target test, etc. It's really great in helping determine is the item you just switched up to is an upgrade or not.
---
Plasma or fusion cores?
---
Yeah I get that, especially when legendaries involved it sucks when they get killed before I can get a shot on it. So I feel you there.
---
interesting how good is this build?
---
There are trees that have sticks at the bottom of them. Get the dry ones
---
 I almost did it solo without even knowing what was happening. Decided I would do it and figured out how to herd em'.
---
 Killed the trash with my knives and kept the herd going. As we got up to the farm another guy showed up and shot some trash and when they went in the pen the Sheepsquatch spawned. I had no idea that would happen and was amused. Pulled out the Bloodied Auto Grenade Launcher as I had lost some health to the trash, and blew it away just as another guy showed up.
---
 Got some stuff and left. ;)
---
Gave you a up vote for stating the truth. These people think Bethesda are doing there best to update the game. In reality they have 2 interns making real updates and 50 others working on the atom shop.
---
Yeah...gotta say I've pretty much stopped looking at the market reddit, because there's a few junk items and everything good is held by some high level hoarder who is trading super high end item for super  high end item or absolutely stupid amounts of caps. It's moronic.
---
it actually is partially the camp owner's fault. its also partially the game's fault. when i noticed possible customers getting stuck in the floor i re-designed my camp in a way that their spawn point isn't covered. 
---
its basically like if you own a restaurant with the sign saying it is open, but keeping the door locked and a window unlocked for people to climb through
---
It is broken with the following
---
Play a snar
---
Play a bass 
---
Play any musical instrument at watoga high school
---
Play any musical instrument at nukashine
---
Play any musical instrument at the rusty pick
---
I used talk to text it supposed to be high-level raids
---
Ohhhhhhhh I see what your saying Haha. Yeah man!
---
I can build a freakin fusion generator but I don't have the skills to build a stupid sack to carry stuff on my back.
---
“If you do,this”....... good,grief I want to know what build that is, what weapon perks etc cause I’m obviously going in there underpowered lol
---
Its just annoying that we have to do all that. It would be cool if i could just click on their name and select to kick.
---
What rewards 😂? A 150 dmg club or some stupid outfit that every 10 year old is wearing in the game? 
---
I do it to kill high level monsters with the chance of a good drop at the end.
---
True, but report them for what?  Playing within the limits of the game?
---
...If you don't give a shit about the event rewards, there are a fuckload of easier farming techniques. And no, not everyone who "gives half a shit about this game" can devote twenty hours a day to farming it like you apparently can.
---
Come visit r/fo76stores! You can post an ad for your store with inventory and prices, or you can search to see who is selling what and for how much. Makes it easy to avoid those who are overcharging!
---
I'd say they've been showing disdain for their player base pretty consistently since before release. Heck, even before the first public beta. Remember how the beta client erased itself, and most of us had to download the whole thing again? They just continue the proud tradition of not giving a flying fuck.
---
LOL.
---
Just giving advice, would you buy a 1* Furious Minigun for 3000 caps? Just want to help people actually sell their items
---
Melt the bosses. If you go to Arkos and you're doing anything but doing y our damnedest to drop as many enemies, especially the alpha, as quickly as possible, you're a fucking asshole.   
---
I've failed that event more times than I've won it due to douches like you. Elsewhere you say "everyone's already gotten everything". I haven't, BECAUSE of assholes like you.
---
I think that’s what the other player did. But the bot never dropped the supplies, and I’m wondering why ....
---
Well to be fair I just started playing around with it damages wise you hit harder for sure. You can swap to Meelee for mat farming which saves ammo. And nuke zones which was my main concern staying alive BC of the damage and it’s manageable with radicool and goulish and just diluted rad away Bc goulish heals your based on rad damage. You have to play a little smarter tho to stay alive but doable. Damage unbuffed with Bloodied is comparable to Explosive with demo before nerf in my opinion
---
Another post showing how people care only about tagging alpha and give a shit about alpha killing last surviving animal as only one person was loading food in to feeders while others are scouting are for legendary mobs that are spawning there quite often. 
---
That's actually really sad as alpha have the same loot table as any other 3 star legendary and he will never drop stimpack diffuser or back pack skin for me 😞
---
I see it frequently, but every time I show up,  I land in the mine as it ends, loose any junk I have, and rage-quit the game because idiotically incompetent quest design makes me angry.
---
Also, Mirelurks at Lake Reynolds, which is right near the Lewisburg Station
---
I only killed one player... and that is because he was lvl 6 and was trying to kill me for 30 minutes...
---
There's a much more efficient way to farm for steel that to fight super mutants for it.
---
I dont want bethesda to nerf my strategy (as they have been showing us they are more than willing to do with public information) so im going to be somewhat vague here, so forgive me if this seems teasing.
---
That being said. You should look into using your excavator power armor for Iron Nodes. There's a particular part of the map that a 2-3 minute walk should net you somewhere around 150-200 iron ore, that converts over to 1000 steal scrap before super duper. This is the only way i can keep up with heavy weapon and automatic rifle ammo conversion.
---
For me, the chokepoint is the Acid, but i built my home on an acid site, and occassionally take hemlock holes and kill the monsters at specific locations known for snallygasters.
---
Anti social behavior or harrasment, to start the list. Going from the OP post and subsequent posts. Block and report, let Bethesda desiden8f within game limits or not. Me , I block permanently and them server hop. After I have dvr footage or the players antics. Past that I don't let other interfere with my play time.
---
Just wait, kill robots as they spawn, it will complete by itself as this happened to me the other day. The bar was at 3% and only 1 chief that I let die and the quest marker remained above its corpse even though I had spawned a new chief. About 15 to 30 mins later the room went dark and the quest progressed, I was able to launch a nuke OK.
---
This isn't a single player game, where you can buy it once (possibly with expansions) and continue to play it forever for free.  There are costs to simply keep the servers online, not to mention all the other activities that go into an online game.
---
If there wasn't any income from continued sales and/or atom shop purchases, the whole thing would just shut down, and you wouldn't be able to play at all.
---
Get gud
---
The game's never worked right when it comes to audio for me. Team works, somewhat, auto works..half the time. Area? never works. I flat out can't \_hear\_ you if you're on area chat.
---
The kids love Battle Royals and there is more money there is potential for infinite money in it, so it wouldn't surprise me. 
---
Bethesda Austin's skill at balancing builds is basically non-existent and the fact they don't nerf builds that need debuffing, they nuke the builds out of existence IMO if they did do a Battle Royal  style mode, I doubt it would be popular with the people who are looking for that style of game play.
---
*Todd howard steps onstage, pauses in silence... and then says* " In fallout 76's Nuclear winter, ill be seeing you, On The Battle Bird!" *Gameplay footage coupled with a metal rendition of country roads blasts. The camera pans to the vertibird over a frozen ash covered West Virginia and air raid sirens blast. Generic 76 dweller jumps out over frozen charleston with like 15 others.screen goes black title appears, silence and howard says* "we decided that 76 BR just works." Crowd is totally silent.
---
I have them all. If you're on PC I'd be happy to slap mods on your gear for you, if you toss me the mats.
---
Scavvers need this desperately
---
This. This is the sole problem with the backpacks I have. If they were like the examples I mentioned - really really highly cusomised and personal - I would have nothing to complain about. The fact my character is too stupid to use a backack on their own is honestly degrading.
---
I honestly was going to buy one until I realized I had 10 that I have gotten from the SBQ lol. They are helpful
---
The false hit is pretty annoying, but I think there's more pressing fixes to general performance.  My advice for false hits are to anticipate them and always double tap. I use melee frequently and have few problems from false hits.
---
I'm currently having this very issue, oddly I cN mod robot armor. But not make it. 🤦‍♂️ 🤦‍♂️
---
T_T. Everybodys got duped shit but me these days
---
The one by top of the world worked for me. It's against the bluff edge bellow the top of the world, down from the train station.
---
I think half the player base plays with a single brain cell fighting for dominance, you could have a massive pink neon sign telling them what to do, and they would STILL focus on the legendary boss to the exclusion of any an all other objectives.
---
I'd say not having a karma system made 4 more realistic. By making one choice give you good karma and the other bad karma, someone has already marked one choice as a "good-guy" choice. By removing that demarcation, I felt that everything you do in 4 and 76 is objectively grey.
---
Yeah, I bought the game so I could play with friends, not get nuked by a level 140 player when I’m just trying to enjoy the story.
---
I've got one for people to just talk about PvP, some roleplay etc. Not many people though
---

---
here is what im currently running on my BGPA build. i do use explosive ammo from time to time, but i never craft it. 
---
i also carry well over 180 fusion cores, so i have to keep batteries included
---
There are clues
---
Run and gun, mix of rifle and melee.  I use hacking to fly by the reactor part.  I use 10-12 stimpaks since I don’t focus on every enemy.  Usually run through in 30 mins or so.
---
"Considerable" is abit strong. More like now and again, usually during sprinting attacks. For me atleast.
---
Nope. That was the first station I checked as it was near the grafton town vendor. You can get plenty of trapper mod plans from either of them, but shadowed trapper or raider wasn't in either of their inventories. They did have shadowed for combat armor, leather, metal, and robot armor though.
---
As everyone else has said...if you're not getting a count down, it's a crash, not a shutdown. It sucks, but if you've played \_any\_ bethesda game you know they are \_all\_ bug riddled crashy messes. You live with it or you don't.
---
That's what happened to me during the fake sheepsqatch event. I wasn't strong enough but had almost 200+ stimpacks. I ran around and got everyone up, ended up burning through most of them and we ended up losing but it was worth it
---
Okay, but the addition of a game mode doesn't retroactively make the game any worse.
---
There are people who still hate Fallout 76 and you know what? They're idiots who can't fathom why people can like something they don't. What's so different if they hate the game still?
---
pretty sure vertibot escorts are only for the nuke cards
---
I'm a stealth build and it usually takes me 45-60 mins to solo it, haven't done it for a while though. I think last time was around lvl 125, I'm lvl 140 now. I'm not quick about it haha, it usually goes south once or twice!
---
I have same issue and was wondering if there was a fix as well. Only happens with this game and constantly 2-3 times an hour. Almost like I expect it every 20 mins now. Error code 1:1:0 or something like that but just says “disconnected from server”.....someone please help
---
They are currently in the files as 4th and 5th star effects, which are not yet available. I believe the only effects that were removed were neverending (now quad and double) and the ones that involved slowing down time
---
The combat shotgun does substantially more damage *per shot* with a perforating magazine. If it's sucking more ammo then you're missing more.
---
I agree with that. I think if you trade for a TSE you are as much of a cheater as the person who duped it. I play 100% self found.
---
I went through and took a hard look at my files and installed games and made space. So annoying though.
---
I have the best gear in the game and only do PvP. I am a high level PvP player, and I do really well. I’m pretty well known on the Xbox Servers. And I can say this, ever since these bugs came up 2-3 patches ago, and with the Scout Patch now making enemies in the air 0%, Im one of the last people running Melee at that level of PvP. And even I have stopped using it primarily. 
---
The issue isn’t god roll armor, I’ve got god roll armor. The issue is that for a melee player, like every player, if you’re taking sustained damage you’ve got to kill quick. You have a very small window of opportunity in end-game PvP and with these glitches, rifle builds reign absolute supreme. It’s really unfair and they’ve ruined Melee competitiveness with these bugs
---
Found the console player. PC doesn't have this option at all. Also, yes, they are. I've argued with these idiots multiple times here.
---
I know that armor/underarmor doesnt stack with PA, but back in the day if you had armor or under armor that gave you DR/ER your power armors DR/ER would take a big hit. Like if you had DR30 armor you got in and the PA DR would drop 70. You had to ride naked/cosmetics only or take a big hit.
---
Glad that most of the other stuff is fixed.
---
I found it really difficult to find a team for new event, i can invite everyone from server and they will come but 90% of the time no one with mic or with any idea what to do what makes it no different then running this event solo, even on discord channels rarely anyone with mic is interested too join.
---
...Yeah no. The flux needed for that mod is worth more than what you think the max price "should" be dude.
---
SO many players are so young they expect a story to be handed to them in 5 minute long cut scenes every time something changes in the game state, they don't read terminals or notes and could care less what a robot is saying that tells why an event is happening.     
---
Granted this game does lack a story thread like the Elder Scrolls and previous Fallout games had, but it has a ton of interesting stories strewn about the world, I have a few incomplete holotape stories I would like to find the missing pieces of and notes that are numbered with some missing as well.     
---
This is where the games stories are, sorry to all the players who are new to this style of game and can't find them.
---
This guy, doing god's (Mothman's) work. TYVM!
---
I CANT PLACE A SINGLE ROOF ON MY CAMP
---
Good boy
---
If this is the case, then I’m struggling to know what happened when I ran the event one time.  I was watching over one of the Brahman. It had about 75% health, and there were no mobs anywhere close to it.  Someone threw a poorly-aimed grenade that landed in the vicinity, and I watched its health drop below 50%.  The Sheepsquach was maybe 100ft away; I didn’t think its area attack had that much reach...
---
You don't have to play it if you don't like it. Lots of people like Battle Royale and I think it would be a cool thing to have in FO76.
---
Agreed, I have no words for how glad I am that they nerfed TSE just made game stupid unless you're dumb enuff to spend real $ on a fictional gun to boost your assumably lacking ego.
---
Sounds like DM tdm and battle royal honestly they all sound coo if the weapons do flat damage or let us a run reasonable builds out of specific perks we have to earn through prestige of experience.
---
I have no doubt that I'm under selling them. I'll cop to that. But I really don't think they're worth 1.5k.
---
Fair point, though honestly I've given up on all but the most basic dailies/weeklies.  
---
Spent hours this weekend running around the ash heap looking for different enemies to photograph, stalled out at 8. Wasn't fun, just wasting my weekend for ~40c.
---
I hate this nonsense. It's up there with "Fifty non-legendary/fashion items" and "Sixty mutton meat pie recipes" used as bait on my list of frustrations with this system.
---
Well then do you really think making a post about it, will help? 🤷‍♀️
---
yeah. I'd say about 500-600, depending on the flux required. He's way to high, you're under-cutting yourself.
---
The only player I ever killed was a higher level when I was around 30 or so. I was trying to do some cooking or something while I was passing through Flatwoods when he started harassing me with slap damage while his buddy watched, probably laughing; when I got tired of it and tried to fight back, I got one-shot with a super sledge. When I respawned and came back for my stuff, they started again, so I dropped a plasna grenade at my feet and took us both out. Ran back, grabbed my stuff and jumped servers.
---
I have bunch of free ones and only used one to test out. I have too much junk that i need to use for something plus i prefer my weapons to be fixed to 200%
---
Too advanced. You need to think more Bethesda "Science Fiction": spear bullets. Maybe an under barrel slingshot for rocks. Tato Gun modifier. /s
---
They did introduce basic poison with the Sheepsquatch stuff. Would be kind of cool if we could get a modifier for plasma/energy like the Radium Rifle on other stuff.
---
We can always hope that ONE of the fucking morons will pay attention.
---
And fancy things to put on the crook.
---
I'm still surprised one of the top selling items is that fucking mutton recipe. I have so many...
---
30 minutes and I’m level 138.
---
It's a random encounter.
---
Just keep playing the main quest, you'll get there.
---
More like 3 times an hour.
---
I mean they were modifiers in fallout 4 im thinking more flexability for legendary weapons
---
I'll be available in 7 mins - dignite
---
Glad I’m not the only one :/. I’m still level 17 and have had the game since it came out lol. Haven’t leveled up because the game is impossible to play with the constant server disconnects.
---
You're the exact reason a lot of us do this, can only imagine the pay out
---
And that seems fair. I can see, with the grind for the materials, how 500-600 seems like a fair price. And, with the exception of like 1 person, that seems to be the general consensus.
---
I agree. I was making a joke. ;)
---
huh, my pip boy did not update. i guess its not important.
---
Hey u can do the event kill the sheepsqautch cuase he aint going anywhere And not fuck over other people u jabroni. You aint the only one there others might want the event rewards.
---
Pretty sure I know that spot. I had my camp there for awhile myself. Great spot for a balcony with a view.
---
The vast majority of events, the end legendary boss is the smallest part of the actual combat. Assholes who down that in 3 shots are, generally, the same group who sit through the entire rest of the event, not "wasting their ammo" on the _actual fucking job_.
---
Yeah I'm aware of that bug. I was just really hoping it was affected by those two perks. Based off how the cards are written I would also think no, but you never know a lot of cards have had hidden/unintentional effects tied to them
---
That would mean people would intentionally go demolish any base that has any defense. Because its really hard to get killed by a base but very easy to destroy one
---
You are missing the most powerful perk that will give you over 50% more DMG it's in luck and it's good with salt
---
yeah. What really grinds my gears, honestly, are the people who are selling non-modded base level gear for a 1k+ caps...the number of times I've seen that just...
---
I want to nuke their camps. I hate griefing, and i'm tempted.
---
This is the best answer...low level muties and a steel making workshop.
---
He owes the player base some contrition, at least. You seem to think I'm suffering from a sense of entitlement. I suppose you're right. I was entitled to a game that wasn't launched in a bug-ridden state and several months from genuine completion. However, I didn't get that, and neither did you. If wanting something that's fit for purpose makes me a 'whiny baby' in your eyes (might as well respond to both your posts here) and means I have an attitude, then so be it. 
---
The free DLC is neither here nor there, as that was announced before launch and the developers have 'given' it to me. I'm not aggrieved by them. They're doing the best they can in the shit situation management dumped them into. I'm aggrieved by management, and Howard is their mouthpiece at E3.
---
A while ago they said no human NPC's would be added back when people were begging for them to add them in.
---
Preventing people from vatsing you means you're bad at PvP? LMAO
---
I'd say the ones winning are the better pvpers as they're smart enough to follow a meta.

You ever heard of berry mentats and Tesla rifles? Clearly not
---
I feel your pain as a vendor, but your list is sadly meaningless in a fallout game because of the nature of how it was designed.  Bethesda does not care about social behavior unless it violates the terms.  
---
I wish I could report the 3 scorched beasts for attacking my camp.  But, it is part of the game.  Same goes with the freedom of actions allowed to players.  The same freedom of action allows you to harass this person, destroy his camp, or steal his loot.  Become his nightmare and he will ultimately return to mind craft...
---
I miss all the challenges.. so tired of the camera.. so very tired
---
Chances are the servers are fine - if they were all constantly disconnecting people, you'd hear no end of bitching about it.
---
Check your connection to the servers.  Find out which servers you're connecting to (you'll have to do a little sleuthing), and run a tracert to them, and see if there are any issues between you and the game servers.  If there are junctions that are performing badly between you and the game servers, it will cause issues like that.
---
I'm assuming you've checked locally for problems, and aren't using wifi for your connection, but if not, check those too.  Wifi *can* suck for connecting to online games like this.
---
Dont scrap your junk and radroach meat expires. The rest are junk items. Make roach meat the last thing you get.
---
I feel ya. I hate griefing as well and yet some of the crap that people do sends me into rage mode.
---
The benefit is that people can't get into my house...
---
Yeah this quest line is very glitched. It glitches at this exact point for many people; did twice for me.
---
Be careful when u scrap junk. Some of the items auto scrap with scrap all...I've done this more times than I care to remember lol.
---
Having a brahmin in your PeePee is also an issue by itself.
---
^^^^(jk I know it means Proyect Paradise)
---
Ah okay, point taken. You are correct, like 80 percent of the time there isn't enough people. Then when there is they are either under leveled or have no idea how to play an objective.
---
I just sold all my salt, pepper, and spices on my alt last night because no one ever buys them from my vending machines.

Sorry. Please don't down vote me. I need validation.

I tried (not at 15 but high Endurance) running Vaccinated 3 and found it made very little difference. I think the # of chances are so high that the odds being low still hit pretty regularly.

I don’t even bother curing most diseases any more ... just picked up Plague Walker on all my characters and only cure when I feel like it is actually hurting me too much to manage. Diseases are annoying, but most are not a big deal post-50.
---
I don’t think todd needs to get on stage and shit on fallout 76 and lick your balls fixing the game is enough for me but I understand you want more good for you I don’t care about Todd’s respect only that Bethesda is committed to fixing the game which they very much seem to be like I said tho don’t play fallout 76 don’t ever play another Bethesda game again hell don’t watch there E3 but I know you and the rest like you will to hell with your ego
---
Census violence is already in the game, Or death blossoms
---
This drives me nuts. I had to carry the whole event because out of six people I was the only one getting kindling. The fire goes out crazy fast with that many people.
---
I cant find anywhere where they've said they wont add any though, I know they said that they want to change the game depending on player feedback and Todd said himself before launch that "this game could be completely different in 12 months"
---
I run them in a melee config mostly, about 30 minutes. I tend to wipe / kill everything including turrets. No hacking for me.
---
There are so many things that it could have been with this game engine being as fickle as it is. Though I know that during the event it treats the brahmin as allies like other players, preventing friendly fire damage. The first things I did when the event was released as spray the brahmin with my AAE minigun and then tesla to test for FF damage, there was none. THOUGH, if the player was not a part of the event then they might be able to damage the brahmin. You can fail to join an event if you fast travel to a friend in the event but not to the event itself. You are also not able to join events that have &lt;2 mins left on the timer or have only a few enemies remaining.
---
They've already announced that the vault raid content will be 4 player based, so they won't be anything like the large raids from other mmos where you could have 20+ people fighting at once.
---
Oh wow for real??
---
I miss challenges that weren't overly convoluted and insane. I know it's technically a co-op game, but it's no longer fun if you HAVE to have another player to do all of the challenges.
---
What an over sight😂 thank you🙌🏼👍🏼
---
“Into Apparel more than most” ... 
---
Have you looked around? This game is filled with people who probably shop more for outfits than anything else ;-)
---
Came here to say this.
---
The reward for completing events is not as good as the potential loot from the legendary monsters
---
I can do it pdq both bloodied ffr or with ve railway.

‪#Fallout76 Someone has just come and destroyed my house and everything in it, and I’m not on survival mode either! How? Then they disappeared ‬

Most players end up getting rid of the nuky/ sparky mutations.  Even if they were affected by the perks, the risk is not worth the gain.  You will not miss them.
---
Aww don't you cry a little bit more? And you reading comprehension is pretty bad. Maybe you should return the middle school. If you re-read my statement I said when I play it solo I kill it when I play with groups I defend the cows. So won't you sit down take a deep breath and go wipe your tears

- Please go to the next chamber and collect some kelp or we'll lose

Thank you and I appreciate it so much
---
I found a stash of legendaries in the cash register in Whitesprings the other day, mostly trash (three star rolling pin, lol) but it helped with that day’s grind!
---
As Todd intended, it just works.
---
On PS4 and have a lab coat if you want it
---
Every time there's something in this game that you're not guaranteed success at you guys throw a tantrum.  Get over it.
---
Legit, the only PvP I ever did was when I'd accidentally catch a bounty when a stray bullet would hit someone's CAMP, and I'd ask them to kill me so I could go on PvEing.
---
You select the option to drop from inventory but it will prompt you it can't be dropped but will be destroyed instead

Yeah. I checked everything and didn’t get any of the new stuff. I’ll check again though. Also dropped all my stims previous because I got them mistaken for my spoiled veggies lol rip
---
When it wasn't broken... there was a period where we got it 2 weeks in a row and it was broken for both weeks where none of the flowers picked were counting towards the challenge.
---
Hopefully, but names can be deceptive. "Survival" for instance doesn't typically denote a PvP leader board game mode as much as it does typically indicate increased core game difficulty or survival mechanics
---
I think you’re being targeted man I’m sorry. A lot of us are good people and we get treated like scum
---
I have a lot of fun on PvP. It does seem that I am always with the same people. 
---
My teammate and I tried blocking each other and joining survival and we still were on the same server. I turned on my VPN and tried again, still same server with the same people  So now I just know who these players are. It's like a weird community where we kill each other. 
---
There are bad guys that use cheap tactics to kill anyone on the leaderboards. And I try to kill them. I do sometimes. It's fun 
---
My favorite fights are with folks who suck at PvP like myself. Or at least don't have sparkle guns and sentinels. Then we are hiding behind shit and trying to get a hit in. A good fight can last up to a minute. Attrition is a real thing in those fights. You can see people loosing the will to keep fighting.
---
There are some cheaters. I know who they are and I just avoid them until they leave. Most of them only stay on the server for 15minutes.
---
Which has the benefit of?
---
Yep.  The card says 'armor and power armor'.  I agree that the graphic is a *bit* misleading, but not sure how I'd fix that.  But it definitely works on both, I've been using it for quite a while whenever I repair.
---
I tried using a BE dragon with my bloodied build on a Sheepsquatch alpha but tbh it didn’t look like it was taking its health off the way I hoped lol, think il def have to go for more dps
---
im thinking it might make it easier for ppl to make traps? and ppl were abusing it in workshops, like my team would get a workshop, barricade all the entrances and nobody else could come and claim it but we could still ft inside.
---
cheating how?
---
Same ! 180h and i didn't even do the 'kill a player' trophy &gt;_&lt;
---
Thanks for the reply! I am using WiFi for it but my place is a tiny studio and the modem is near the PS4. I’ll try wiring it. 
---
Not sure what a tracert is but I’ll look into that.  Thanks!
---
I have this lately on PS4...never had any problems til I changed to team and now I no matter what setting I can't hear anyone.
---
&gt; By more substantial pve stuff I mean actual story. More involvement in whats happening in the world and not the sort of quests the game is full of now (which all of sort of feel very side quest ish)
---
How would that work in a MMORPG?  In a single player RPG (or RPG-lite) game there is story because the game moves at the speed of the player.  In a MMORPG the story never progresses because they never know who's on the server, where they are in the story, if they're going to stumble on the next part of the story, or who might get to the next part of the story first.
---
How the hell are you making 5k caps in 3 evenings of "casual" play? That's 1666 caps per game session of what, 4 hours?
---
Try to keep an open mind about new content. A huge majority of the internet thinks that Fallout 76 is a worthless game that nobody wants, but you and I know better than that. Just try to keep that in mind as the future unfolds.
---
I just got to level 50 and I've played alone the entire time (except to get that stupid tadpole revive an ally thing) and really enjoy. 
---
We'll have to wait and see what nuclear winter has in store and if it is a BR, hope they do something different.
---
Big bend tunnel, pick up everything as you go through it. There’s workbenches either end to scrap what you picked up
---
They likley work as perfect storm will show; I'm guessing they're just waiting in the wings for a special day.
---
Harpers ferry. Come out with like 20-30 assault/hunting rifles + shotguns. Equip scrapper and they’ll each get you around 10 steel
---
Yes but did you know that...
---
You have contracted Radworms.
---
I get a decent amount of kills in pvp, but every time I've been killed in the last month it has been by an explosive automatic rifle.
---
I've sold every ammo type for 1c each. It really isn't a big deal.
---
There is a difference between trying to coordinate a group event vs trying to tell people that the choices they make that effect no one are wrong.
---
Thanks for sharing though.
---
I really hope Nuclear Winter is a hardcore version of Adventure Mode with harsher survival mechanics, and more dangerous environments.  Not another PVP mode that's just chasing trends.
---
I've never played survival mode once. A battle Royal mode would just be another mode I ignore.
---
I've been 3 hours today jumping from camp to camp searching for that :P
---
I'm on PC.
---
~15 min, though I haven't timed it to be exact. 
---
I run heavy Gunner and stay in PA. This way I can just blast my way through the silo. Turrets don't do too much damage and areas that I'm in I can take them out pretty quick. 
---
I pick the door and hack the terminal instead of restarting the reactor. 
---
I use a Gatling gun with explosive and I can hit the consoles once and usually knockout the entire set of mainframe cores on the console. I used to use grenades but that takes too long. 
---
I always prepare my mainframe cores before hand. I usually keep 2 complete sets on me at a time. This way I can just plug n play when I get to the room. I do end up having to wait around as I've clicked all of the slots for the cores, but for lag reasons it just sits there abd every minute or so 2 or 3 will pop in there even if I'm running around picking up the lewt in the area. It's pretty annoying but I also get to loot stuff lol. 
---
Then I run into the control room, knockout the nearby turrets and assaultrons, initiate the launch sequence, then eliminate the remaining bots as the time is ticking rather than clear them first. I can usually knock em all out and the turrets before the next two bots spawn to assist the sequence. Then just kill anything else that spawns in. 
---
I should time this.
---
Just a thought, for anti bloodied build the best gamma gun will be Executioners, for +50% dmg
---
At your level, I'd pick up the scrapper card in intelligence (you don't need to keep it on all the time, just swap out when needed), and scrap all the weapons you find for metal.  
---
Wood can just be gathered pretty much everywhere (there is a perk card for that too, Woodchucker in luck), and when you finally get a stack of materials, Contractor in luck will reduce the building costs.
---
I wouldn't invest in those perk cards though until you get past 50, but if you're not in a rush to get overpowered, it's an option.
---
I'm not sure what the "popular map floating around this sub" is but have you tried using [this online map?](https://fo76map.com/) I use this one and it's pretty accurate most of the time. I think there were a couple things it wasn't accurate on but for the most part it's been pretty reliable for me. There's one by Big Fred's BBQ Shack that I was setup on for a while but it didn't really yield enough steel to be viable for me... I find myself netting more steel just killing Super Mutants and scrapping their guns, lol.
---
Quick runs in Westek kill mutants take their caps, ammo and assault rifles, sell rifles for caps. It's around 20 minutes per character, obviously it will take much more time if you don't have 5 high lvl characters, I have as i was testing different builds and as you know respec isn't a good option for that.
---
Yeah I dont' bother with pvp because it just becomes a 1 shot fest after around lv 100.
---
Do you mean items commonly found in vendor machines or those actually "sold" by player vendors (i.e. what do people actually buy?).
---
If the former:  everything and nothing
---
If the latter:  it varies ..... some things sold really, really well when vending machines launched and don't sell much at all anymore .... what sells is what is sold cheap (like essentially free cheap).
---
Tyler County Fairgrounds, you'd have to claim it.
---
Awesome. Thank you!
---
I bought some but I stay around 3000 atoms and have most of the attom shop already . I can't do the queen cuz I'm a hoarder and it's a long run (I'm working on it). They were handy while I was trying to get my armor sorted cuz my raider chest piece seemed to break constantly and there are just too many good agilt perks to run white knight for me.
---
You can't even pvp if your lower than level 5.
---
It's all good. I saw someone comment that everyone poking fun and saying people need tougher skin are the_donald posters when I've personally never visited that cesspool lmao. It's sad people get so offended about this shit and act like bitches
---
Try looking at the tea pot there’s normally a tourist on one of the benches near by
---
I do it to organize. I put a sign on each that says what it has (weapons, chems/food, junk/ammo, etc)
---
I don't even think I could repay you man, just goes to show there are incredible people out there!
---
New Important update, this bug has been fixed on the most recent patch. I checked for myself
---
and the quest has appeared in my side quests. I hope you fellow vault dwellers finally get to enjoy this quest!
---
If it's not the only game that does it, then it's more than likely your own internet connection. This game DEFINITELY has its issues, but if you're getting a similar experience with other games, then you should start investigating that. Sometimes psn has its days where it's just a monumental pain to get anything working right (or for long), but I haven't had that in a good while. How good is your connection to begin with? If it's below par, you kinda have to expect this kind of experience. Like, if you have at least 10 to 20 mbps download, you should be okay (unless you share that internet access with several other people where you live). Are you connected to your internet source wirelessly? The ps4 itself doesn't have the best wireless network card/chip/whatever (at least mine doesn't). The moment I said screw it and lead a long cable from my router to my ps4 after trying multiple wireless solutions, I had 6-10 times the connection I previously did... went from about 6 to 12mbps download to averaging around 54-64. So it was certainly eons better than before. You can also check to see if your ISP has been having issues recently. There can be multiple reasons why you could be disconnecting so heavily. but if you're not already, I REALLY recommend going ethernet.
---
I really wish there was a PVP mode that had no legendaries and no serum/mutations. Just regular weapons and armor, where skill would actually matter.
---
Can u drop them? I have been struggling to find 1
---
this game need text chat and chat channels
---
I don’t even bother with them anymore. It’s kind of nice not feeling the need to check them out because I know they’re going to be Fucking ridiculous, last one I remember seeing was get a picture taken by another player while you’re both naked in a nuke zone. Like
---
Wtf that’s not even possible
---
I have a furious handmade that is probably one of my best weapons.  I have it in semi-auto mode, not fully auto.  And I am a rifle build.
---
They need to have every event listed and let you track them. That way when it pops up you get an alert in the top left of the screen and you don’t miss events needed for daily challenges.
---
No plans, and mods are sold in enclave bunker in Generals armory.
---
You'd need to do that from a PC (not sure there's any way to use a console to do that), it's an old tool on PCs to check the network connection between you and a target system.  It 'pings' (not to be confused with the actual ping command) all the network hops along your path to see if any are under performing.  Google should give you a few hundred thousand examples, it's been around forever ;-)
---
*crickets*
---
There are a lot of reasons why it wouldn't work, but it being unfair isn't one of them. This is an online game with a lot of rng, very few people will experience every inch of content.
---
THEM NOT GETTING IN MY HOUSE!!! Caps for effect.
---
Also make the daily quests act like a real daily where it’s there consistently every time you go to do it so you do t have to server hop. Then they could all be tracked through the terminal as well.
---
Yes and no. I am really annoyed by battle royales, BUT if they copied The Division (1)'s survival mode, they would strike gold. 
---
For those of you who've never played it, you start on a random portion of the full map and are stuck in a massive blizzard with no gear and an infection timer which can be slowed by taking medicine. You have to collect scrap to craft clothing that keeps you warm because every time you go outside your core temp drops and when that meter runs out you lose health. You also craft gear, mods, and weapons as you toward the center of the map where enemy difficulty steadily increases.
---
The players work towards the center of the map and craft a respirator before they enter the contaminated zone where they have to find DNA samples and try to get extracted. After calling for extraction, Hunters (super hard PvE enemies) spawn they have to fight off.
---
This mode is matchmaking-ran and can be PvE or PvP, solo or team. Even in PvE modes, the environmental enemies are the biggest danger and you spend more time fighting or avoiding them than other players. In my opinion, it's the only battle-royale game worth playing. I think that game type would match PERFECTLY with FO76. One thing that all division players agreed, complainers and fanboys alike, was that survival mode was amazing.
---
TL;DR if nuclear winter was a clone of The Division (1)'s Survival mode, it would be kickass.
---
No luck.

Me, scrapper perk, and farm super mutant areas, or just run around WS gathering hangers for 170 or so scrap at a time.
---
i should make plague my next recipe pickup...
---
only thing i bother to cure is parasites, i dont carry enough veggies to outeat it
---
I wouldnt be bothered by it in the least..
---
I think for PvP to work we need new modes. As it is it's unsalvageable. Some might still enjoy it, but to me it's always the same: whoever has the best legendaries/bloodied build and gets their hit in first wins. It's boring.
---
I actually love PvP in other games. I love fighting games. To me the best way to make new PvP modes would be to level the playing field like a fighting game. No more OP legendary based builds, sorry Akuma42069. Obviously we should be able to choose from some style of fighting, but it should be like we're all level 1 and have the same stats. Team deathmatch with a level playing field and dangerous mobs thrown in? Yeah, I'd play that.
---
No selling when offline. You have to find a way to AFK. I'm on PS4 I crouch go into photo mode and spin the camera by hanging my controller by the right analog. Some players use a rubberband.
---
I don't have an answer to the camp is full.
---
So I guess you don't craft it then? You just have to purchase it?
---
Doesn't sound fun to me at all. Would be a poor new mode (but after all Survival is just that, a poor adaptation).
---
Just more of the same, killing players. For that I go play an FPS.
---
When I buy an RPG, online or not, I want to do quests, explore and improve my toon, not kill another player and brag about it.
---
But ofc I respect your opinion.
---
Camp is full means your stash is full or cant hold the item you are trying to put in as for the other no you can only sale when you are online from your vending machines..
---
And I don't, i will only say good for you 👍
---
Try the division (1) survival mode
---
It can't be a well-crafted BR if PvP in F76 is crap in the first place.
---
Bethesda would need to hire another team that actually knows how to balance and design PvP games for that.
---
Which random spawn did you find it at?
---
I thought I might be Morse code, 2 dots = dash and 1 dot = dot but I can’t make sense of the arrangement
---
. Can anyone see a way to group the information in such a way as to produce 4 digits?

Its only worth what someone will pay.
---
Theres a normal dog in the mire at the very top of the mountain overlooking Harper's Ferry across the river.
---
I go through the Pleasant Valley resort and cabins and sell all looted weapons to the vendor in the resort with Hard Bargain 3. A usual run takes 10 mins and gets me around 600 to 900 caps. Then I either server hop to max out or just play normally and sell meat (cook it first for higher prices) and extra stims I pick up.
---
Or, or... They are have been consistently trying to push socialization and talking since the BETA and the camera challenges often require you talking to someone.
---
Or, you're complaining about getting free "money".  Everyone's attention needs to focus on the challenges that aren't working than the daily challenges that work fine but are complicated or require talking.
---
Thanks. I appreciate the good info on this.
---
I run West Tek and loot all the bodies. Slap on Scrapper perk and those assault rifles give like 26 steel each. Plus I get a bunch of bone for serums.
---
Here
---
Just to reiterate what others have said, run West Tel or Pleasant Valley when it has super mutants and gather every weapon. Scrap with the scraper perk and you will get hundreds per run.
---
make a lvl 50 high capacity backback.
---
I have PS4 but I would paint the floor with you.
---
Well, this is because the game is half a year old and there is still not economy really established. They payers saying pricing is wrong aren't wrong, and the people pricing how they want aren't wrong.
---
All the issues of this type normally break down to failures on Bethesdas part.
---
Did you just assume the bot's gender? Triggered! /s
---
Its most likely going to be contained to that specific vault and not a whole separate thing. Plus a BR would remove the complaints that people have overpowered weapons in pvp
---
That makes no sense.  It uses one per shot...
---
In a BR you wouldnt start off with the weapons you own... so they wouldnt need a balance team
---
For 10 atoms!
---
An no VATS, amiright ?
---
Chanting? What kind of chems are you taking?
---
Thank you so much for that tip!
---
Doing Uranium Fever always leaves me with tons of steel.
---
Not sure if this works, but you are the landlord so if someone is in your machine and afk or whatever they do, try to move or store your machine. This should kick them out.
---
Perhaps meet in the middle?
---
Bethesda knows what they won't be putting back into the economy - why not allow the players that purchased those items to monetize them? There were many limited offers I missed out on, and only Bethesda knows and only history will tell if they ever come back.
---
If something NEVER comes back - obviously a decision made long after it's gone - I see no reason why a player SHOULDN'T be able to monetize them.
---
All of them? No, obviously that still puts a kink in how the servers are supported - instead of going to the movie theater people would wait for it on Netflix so to speak. I just know people would be unhappy if their one item they want to get, or sell, never becomes available... but it is what it is 🤷‍♂️ There's just as many more that will be sad to see their in game uniqueness vanish. 
---
But if something never comes back... why not be able to spread the love?
---
Why making them so easy, when all you just have to do is making some of them impossible to complete due bugs.
---
And at the end, guaranteed 3* legendary.
---
I had that issue. I think it's caused by the problems in the past with wires counting for camp budget. I have 83% of my budget used up (nothing stored) with 20 spare pounds in my stash and it didn't let me put in a plan until I scrapped some carrots
---
Huh. I'll have to try that out. I never spent much time around Pleasant Valley besides Rose's quests.
---
It doesnt... i tried. I actually disconnected the machine and moved it. The trade menu was still locked
---
My issue is with a plan as well. I was able to put in other items, but not the plan
---
I just posted this! TD1's survival mode is the best possible BR situation
---
VATS is at least something that every player starts with and can utilize. It'd be cool to have an ultra "realistic" mode, as far as post apocalyptic mutants and flying doombats can make it anyway.
---
Yeah, that'll definitely take me a bit longer with my two characters at 34 and 72. Thanks for the advice, though! I'll check it out next time I'm on.
---
Well done.
---
Usually under 15min with a two-man bloodied team, depending on server lag. Sometimes my buddy dies because he runs no defensive perks at all, so that sets it back a bit. Some speed tips:
---
1. In the first section, don't follow the markers. Instead, find a card and use the scanning booth first, then blank &amp; write at the same time, then register. You don't need to read the instructions.
---
2. Hacking the reactor room is probably faster than repairing, although we used to do the latter before running into server lag problems. This part's definitely easier with two players because one can lockpick/hack while the other covers.
---
3. Grenading the cores is faster than pulling them.
---
4. Repairing the mainframe cores is much faster than searching for them. Make sure you have a pile of circuits spare, and farm them from the robots along the way to top up.
---
5. In the last scene, head straight to the upper level and initiate the launch sequence rather than clearing the whole room first.
---
There is no ‘well-crafted’ pvp in a game with cheesy legendary armor &amp; weapon effects. PVP in this game is 80% gear-based, which would have to be resolved to have a meaningful BR. Hopefully they skip the BR altogether- just tweak Survival to lean into PVP even more
---
Ok That sucks then, I remember seeing video of the Purveyor and someone was hitting ppl with armor fist, witch moved them by bits and disconnected them from trading.
---
Thank you!
---
I had no clue he was a real person.
---
I have bought a Bloodied Explosive harpoon gun and a TSE combat rifle from player vendors for 310 Caps and 1600 Caps in the last week (I then sold the the harpoon gun for 15k caps). Things cost what the market will spend, and when things are so rare, the fact that there is a cap limit and do many ways to get caps in general means that caps become irrelevant at some point.
---
Same in german and after what i've seen on beth's official site, also for russians. it's better be fixed by tuesday or there'll be at least one person being really mad.
---
I did something similar at my camp. I put
---
Codes all over the place to make things work.
---
A few more bullets? You clearly don’t play🤡 Went from 4 shot with a TSE Handmade to 24... so where’s the “few” extra bullets?
---
Yes. The other enclave vendor sells pieces and enclave events can reward pieces. The new legendary vendor has a chance to give legendary scout armor and it may drop from enemies now but not certain.
---
I agree with them adding more story stuff and a long quest with interesting things. I think they need more wierd things like in fallout 3 when an alien ship would blow up above you and drop an alien pistol. Or when someone would run up to you and ask you to disarm an explosive colar on there neck but then they explode. They should add an event were you fight aliens in an alien ship.
---
Ahhh, you’re that guy
---
I think that it would be hot garbage. I play BR games and competitive multiplayer games and love them dearly, but Fallout 76 is neither of those. 76's pvp is currently REALLY bad and unsatisfying and ultimately a BR mode would be a waste of development time that could be used to improve the game with meaningful content.
---
When I go to the vendor if I'm going to get armor I always make sure I have enough script left to trade in for wood armor.  Past two days had two nice wood pieces that I would have worn but immediately traded in.  Today's was a Bolstering wood chest piece with +1 Perception and WWR by 20% :(
---
Hmmm. Horrible outlook on things🤡
---
It isn't dumb, 4 vending machines sell 30 things each.. much easier to organize, you can even put labels on the outside whether it's ammo/weapons/chems/armor..
---
What would be stupid is having 4 vending machines that all show the same thing, where you have to scroll through 120 things at once to see if they have anything you actually want.
---
This goes WAY deeper than just vendor prices. People here try to control everyone's play in every single possible way. 
---
"Don't one shot anything, because then I don't get anything!" - Tough shit. That's life. 
---
"Ugh stop making rad showers in YOUR camp" - No. 
---
"Ugh STOP nuking!"
---
"UGH. Don't build your camp THERE"
---
"Ugh. Don't build your camp like that, I don't spawn in front of the vending machine!"
---
So on, so forth...
---
If i want to list treasure map for 25k and jet pack plan for 50 caps I can and probably i will quickly notice that treasure maps are not selling and jet pack plan is disappearing as soon as someone come to visit me and then i can adjust pricing or ignore it. If you see something that's too expensive for you don't buy it, if you need it but you feel it's too expensive and no one want to sell it for cheap don't try to unload frustration here, it's like people complaining how over priced iPhone products are but they want them.
---
Its great because it's a high concentration of enemies and the vendor is right where you're farming so no need to do an overencumbered walk across the map.
---
Yeah, although I don't think the blast radius is very large. It's handy for topping up your rads by shooting at your feet.
---
Its more that alot of people want to fully immerse themselves in the world, or roleplay, which includes downtime in the wasteland.
---
Your build lacks focus, you can’t have a heavy weapons, 2H, and 1H build and expect it to do high damage at end game
---
Yeah I know. The others commenting are BSG dickriders so cant even argue they’ll defend BSG if they kidnap their whole families &amp; nerf them... about as crazy as the fanatics in the damn fallout games lmao
---
Pls no
---
if Legendaries with the affixes:
---
- Explosive
---
- Bloodied
---
-Anti Armor
---
were removed from guaranteed Legendary drops would you still feel the same and be motivated?
---
The Chaoskampf continues.
---
Ya I really wish they would fix it or take it out of the legendary pool.
---
Graham sells the plan but it is random when you find him on the map.
---
It was on the road going into Lewisburg right where the road forks.
---
I think rather than asking developers to change minor game mechanics, using market subreddit or many other places when you need to sell ammo is the way to go. I'd much rather have new content rather than a way to dump ammo, when you can always go sell it to players, just takes a bit more effort.
---
So its dogshit because you cant kill things with less than 5 bullets anymore? Like I said, just whining you cant play on god mode anymore
---
I like BR modes. Sad to say but I am in the minority.
---
I have heard that if your pet gets killed and you jump worlds your pet should spawn back with you. You have to do this within a few minutes of its death. Let us know if this actually works.
---
Likewise, if you're not done with it already just let me know and I can help (ign evaric714). 
---
Also, there's a back entrance through the underground garage where you only face a handful of enemies on your way to the lab if you end up needing to solo it.
---
Honestly it sounds great. The PVP is pretty good without BS builds and BS legendaries. The most fun I had with the game was a pvp fight between me and 2 friends and a group of 4 randoms over about 15 steel lol, all level 6 to 10 it was great.
---
I'm level 201 I've killed maybe 40 people. This was before PvP servers. They were always people griefing lower levels or they tried to pick a PvP with me. Actually 4 were level 20s that tried to basically mug me before the TSE nerf I was level 120. I've killed 1 since the PvP servers because he broke into my camp to use my work bench. Had to leave uranium fever early because it said my camp was under attack and I was pissed. I don't play on the PvP servers at all. Glad most of the trolls are over there though. Makes for a better game on the PvE.
---
Probably no
---
Make sure to unload anything you don't need before going there to carry more rifles to vendor and whatever your build is collect for yourself set of unyielding armour too boost charisma before selling (i like unyielding wood for my power armour character because it can be modded to shrouded and weight almost nothing)
---
That is literally what faschnaught festival was. And it was insanely popular.
---
What the fuck does that have to do with absolutely anything I said?
---
I think what you're experiencing is the free part of the content. 😁
---
Got to write that essay ;)
---
Go to the WS entrance (hotel, not the train station or the bunker), and check the hood of the red car right in front.  It's steps away from the spawn point.  That's the quickest place to server hop that I know of (no travel time).  Repeat until you find it.
---
I’d say just get the workshop at a power plant, set it all up with defence and All and them go and play the game- come back in a few hours and there will be a lot of stuff (lock your resources)
---
Honestly I like that group. Compared to /politics which is suppose to be nonbiased but should be renamed /the left or die.
---
Okay.... but tesla rifles in PvP shouldn't be allowed
---
Damn straight. I want the update, but 3 months later and I'm still salty. ;)
---
48. I’m level 189. Had close to 60 but got a nice Bloodied Explosive Gatling from the purveyor so I spent to mess with a heavy build

It’s seems like  it’s always vats users that want to take away legendary gear, stealthboys, chameleon etc but for non-vats players like myself, these items provide at least some balance when going against players with LITERAL auto-aim. 
---
btw I actually like the challenge of fighting auto-aimers. It feels like fighting above average npc’s without path scripting lol.
---
Would be too OP in the terms of 76's game design that mostly have melee enemies surrounding you.
---
That guy is definitely me
---
perhaps it is under Machined Guns... I’m unsure, though.
---
Pretty much every legendary I've come across in a vendor machine is too overpriced
---
what did you expect from a console
---
Or just something for your camp, like boardgames or a deck of cards that starts an event so people know you are getting a game going.
---
I hadn’t played in months, got on and tried out Survival Mode. Within seconds of loading in a player killed me
---
Ya know, you can just like, not play it right? They'll continue to support both ends, just as they have.
---
How would you know if you aren't reading a griefer's wall of text?
---
if anything hopefully it will be tiered
---
Okie doke. Thank you!
---
Ya they are. But it only lets me craft lvl 5 on these 2 and everything else is at lvl10.
---
I just want my name here to boost it. Like yeah, if they announce a fucking BR for 76 at E3 it’ll just invite a new wave of manufactured outrage/noise by the assholes of the internet. Even if Nuclear Winter has BR that’s fine just leave that for In The Vault
---
It has to be pvp related somehow. I hope it's a completely unique experience with coop/ competitive elements/ survival of the fitest with the looting and collecting of resources. It fits this whole theme of the game perfectly.
---
scrap guns
---
my guess then is the next available level is 15.
---
Yes, it's called the "Fujiniya Intelligence Base Scientist Corpse".  It seems to only spawn within a certain distance from Mama Dolce's Food Processing, which I've mapped out here: 
---
https://i.imgur.com/JH1N2Bz.jpg
---
I can't guarantee that it's 100% accurate, but those *should* be the only points where it can spawn.
---
Killing non-hostile animals, like frogs could be bad karma. Unless you are hungry and eat the frog legs within a certain period.
---
I'd like to see named reputations like from fo1 and fo2. Whether it is 'hero of thebwasteland' or 'graverobber'. The end game decisions that we make should result in some kind of reputations
---
Yeah I've gone on politics and political humor a couple times and it's definitely biased to the left. I've never fucked with the_donald because I've heard it's all cringe shit and incel shit which I dont fw lol. I hate seeing people act like fools when I share the same beliefs
---
I dont use VATS in game, and would be fine with a mode without it either. I don't like legendaries solely because there are people who will never find a TSE in game, possibly ever. I enjoy using rifles with iron sights/ red dots.
---
Love the tactical chef look! Who cares if it's not a perfect likeness? But, please, ya gotta tell us you carry a rolling pin, and also what legendary effects it has...
---
If you ever do feel like changing the outfit, though, the normal white skiing outfit is a near-perfect match. They're all over the ski lodge just east of Top of the World, and I hear there's also a clean one in the basement.
---
I thought they confirmed there would not be any battle royal mode ;w;,why Bethesda!!!! Anyway nuclear winter,I hope it adds a ice area to the map,as a map expansion would be awesome!!!!
---
That gun can only be crafted at lv 5/15/25/25/45
---
Isn’t the Camp Fire Tales event pretty close to what you are describing? Listen to a story, a scavenger hunt, do emotes and eat, and exterminate a few low level bugs that you could kill with a level 1 pipe pistol.
---
😒 ill have to see later tonight. Frustrating as 10mm is my everyday pistol and its falling behind pretty fast.
---
they need to add push to talk, and muting other players made easy for me to start using mic
---
I like how you described that!
---
"Grey" is how 76 feels right now. Theres no consequences for your actions (Reputation wise) in-game, people can flag your GT on all forms but thats it.
---
Seems right to me, about half the scientists left the base before the Enclave stormed it so it's pretty reasonable they would only get so far from the base
---
all i see in this thread is a bunch of sissies
---
God, I hope it isn’t BR! If I wanted to play BR I’d be on Fortnite or PUBG.
---
Maybe we shouldn't have builds and items that can one shot a boss then if this is going to be so much of an issue :P
---
They need to improve what was advertised rather than adding different games
---
Ok thank you! Kinda odd but whatever. I need a new one quick. Its getting tough to kill mobs at my lvl let alone the random lvl22 i run into once im a while.
---
Your comment is very insightful, thanks.
---
I will find it and message you - give me a few
---
I did read that, but forgot until you mentioned it right now. Had to log off and he went to doggy heaven. R.I.P. attack dog. I have never tried it, but will if I can find another one and get the chance. Any tips on camping in the ash where it’s less likely to spawn enemy’s? Do you know if I lock my doors with my camp unit thing inside if it will get out? Tried it with my mega sloth but the mofo was big and didn’t work.
---
Would work, but yet to see it done
---
Going to chime in here, i'm a big fan of pvp games as well. I'm nearly level 150 and i steer clear of any form of pvp simply because of how volatile it is - as OP said everyone seems to have a one shot build.
---
What makes pvp fun in other games is the ability to counterplay. Where's the counterplay to getting one shot constantly? Sure if a sniper blows your head off you dust yourself off and acknowledge it was a good shot. But it seems like in this game there are far too many "one shot builds" or weapons capable.
---
I mean as i said i'm nearly level 150 and i get one shot was people who are in their 30s - yet for some reason there are instances of me unloading an entire ammo clip into them and it's as if i do no damage. I feel as if the damage scaling system that's in the game for low and high level players works completely backwards.
---
This game was never intended for PvP yet for some reason Bethesda wanted to shove it down everyone's throat. The fact you had to add the survival mode option alone proves the point the community generally doesn't like the PvP offered in this game.
---
Having hundreds of hours logged on various BR, i can assure you if Nuclear Winter is a BR it's going to flop hard and FO76 will once again become the laughing stock of the gaming community. There are other BRs which have been released with vastly superior mechanics that have failed. 
---
And you know what the worst thing will be? They'll start balancing the game for PvP trying to fix one shot builds, which means a ton of more nerfs, which means almost everyone's build again becomes broken, game becomes a shitty grind.
---
If you want successful PvP, add small scale, instanced PvP with some sort of reward where everyone has the same stats/loadout.
---

OH SHIT IS THAT A SKYRIM PORT FOR MY MICROWAVE"
---
Grafton steel workshop pumps out steel like crazy.
---
Thank you so much! Switched out the Perk now! I'll keep an eye on the others though at some point! Much appreciated!
---
What a shit show a battle Royale would be haha
---
This is a question I cannot answer I have never tamed a pet myself. Although I am looking forward to doing so soon.
---
I have doors on my C.A.M.P. for aesthetic reasons,  but locking the doors? Never
---
This needs to happen so desperately! I just had to stop for a bit and chill after losing my workshop after a whole hour of having it thanks to a crash to home screen during a workshop defense event. I love just losing my resources like that before I even have a chance to collect from the workshop!
---
Depending on your perks and your intelligence (?), you can build/repair things to have more than 100% durability.
---
There should be a light colored bar in the middle of your durability bar on the item, that's the extra.  Once that runs out, you'll start to lose durability on the main bar.
---
It's intended, and a pretty cool feature.
---
Thank you, I didn't even know you could lock resources! I'll cut down my inventory and do this as I'm on for a few hours tonight now anymore!
---
Not me..
---
I think BR will be really good for the game, particularly in terms of combat balance. I'm pumped to see how it plays out.
---
Potential silly question, is the event located at Dolly Sod’s? And if so, will server hopping help me find the mission?
---
Selling stuff as a vendor to other players.
---
I’ve said this before- I hope it’s like the  Operation Anchorage DLC for Fallout 3, where you load into a simulation and have only what you pick up or predetermined loadouts and simplified and streamlined environments.  
---
I personally think this would be an amazing addition to the game.
---
There are plenty of people like myself that like to collect those rewards. What good loot? The one star legendary?
---
PvP mode is useful for extra XP, but basically nothing else unless you like trading 25 caps bacl and forth all day.
---
There are a few other weapons that are like that as well
---
I know all that but it wouldnt take any damage and i took off all those perks and still was 1 and a half bar
---
On [PC] I made 25k on one character from selling 1* low level weapons and armor, used to give it away but harder to find level 5's that aren't Alts
---
If you're going to run a respectable Chef build I must tell you that correcting people on the pronunciation of Boyardee is essential. There's an old commercial where the Chef tries to get people to pronounce it correctly in vain. It's not BoyarDEE, as he says, it's Italian so it's BoyARRdee. 
---
You're welcome.
---
Just sent you a message
---
High level enemies spawn there, so nuking makes them even better for XP, plus theres frequent legendary enemies, as well spots to camp in where enemies cant hurt you while you kill them.
---
I know right?
---
So it's still alive? Is it crucified on a plaque or something?
---
You wanna look for iron veins and there is Grafton steel workshop with 2 or 3 steel resources there. 
---
If you wanna equip the scrapper perk and hit Westek, I usually come out with 2 crap legendaries and about 609 steel from scrapping weapons. Added plastic from the laser rifles for about 200 a run.
---
Geez people still with this create a new account and move on
---
You can get the blocker perk for melee enemies, but I kinda feel you on the ranges department. With my BoS armor I’ve got something like 453DR and 393HP yet I still feel extremely squishy
---
It doesn't matter unless you want the plans for the melee weapons or their mods. Then it matters. Matters a lot.
---
I buy great rolled weapons and resell them. Yesterday I sold 2 junkies hunting rifles for 10k each and an explosive Gatling laser for 20k. Those cost me 10k caps to buy. While also selling many items for 1-2k for well rolled but not great weapons. Armor I sell ranges from 500-3000. 
---
I've now got a growing friends list of people who come by to shop. Today I'm basically maxed out on caps so I'll have to spend most of it shopping and hopping to restock. Yesterday morning I had 30 armor and 25 weapons for sale. Today it's 20 armor and 12 weapons. 
---
My main also has 2 full sets of armor, all with powered/sentinel affixes. While my alt has 3 great rolled junkies/bloodied snipers and 5 pieces of 3* unyielding. 
---
So mostly I've had success selling weapons and armor.
---
Masses, fluids, XP, and legendaries.
---
Again, broken armor isnt an exploit and being an owner of said armor I can tell you I got creamed many times while wearing it pre patch. Just because Bthesda didnt specify its weakness after nerfing it doesnt mean there were none. The armor worked exactly as it was designed to as well, then they decided the design was flawed. It wasnt en exploit an you have yet to make a single solid argument. You just keep screeching "Exploit, Exploit, Exploit!" without even knowing the meaning of the word.
---
The card says what it does ...
---
Iron ore deposits give steel scrap with an extractor.
---
Game has been unplayable at times since this last patch.  I too get this. I've cut back playing since the patch because the game is unplayable at times.  Interesting thing is some people claim zero issues where everyone I know has a boatload.
---
Since last update I'm experiencing a lot of freezes, i don't know why but every new contest they are adding comes with the price you just never know what it will be, this time game freezes 🤬
---
That makes sense, then. Thanks
---
So it isn't chess, but I do run a holotape game arcade on PC that has weekly events with the intent of meeting other players. I would love to see more social tools in the game, but we don't have to wait on Bethesda to meet others, we really just have to escape the loop and reach out.
---
We must have different feeds because mine is particularly positive besides the server instability involving the new event🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Having something OP doesnt make you better. Ot doesnt take any skill at all to pop and stealth boy and jumping around firing a Tesla rifle in all directions because you cant aim yourself. Get real.
---
Whitespring has every flux there except violet. It has a high density of legendary ghouls in one area. More than any other location. Most people don't do this, but you can even hit the power substation and the supermutant shack to include extra areas for possible legendary spawns. It's quite the anomaly.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only person that had that thought when the saw the blue door... extra bonus points to you for acting on it.
---
Alright give me a moment to find it
---
Honestly, I'm done if Nuclear Winter is battle royale. I'm already barely playing, and fully ready to let this game die. I love fallout. I still play New Vegas weekly, but I won't play a fallout with battle royale. That's not fallout, it's a cash grab.
---
I bet that they might get more glitches in the game when they release BR, and people might start to explode the glitches to an unfair competition.
---
Hell yeah. Upvote the shit out of this.
---
Adventure is your normal fo76. Survival is your normal map but pvp
---
"Do a spin move"
---
This
---
Where may I find a location like this?
---
Name some games where it takes 20 bullets to kill an enemy. I’ll wait🤡 (good games, popular btw not some dogshit indie game we don’t know)
---
If I see the event has already started (people at the cows), I actually go to the farm and kill in reverse, clearing the static spawns. If there's a legendary amongst them, I drag it back to the herders.
---
After that I let the cows and herders go at their own pace to the different trigger points where I have perches I sit and wait at where I have a good field of view to catch the trigger spawns.
---
You don't have to sit with the cows all the time if you know all the spawns.
---
At the end, you have a few seconds to grab a tag/aggro from the SS, before you can easily focus on the insects.
---
I'm on the same quest now. No option to collect the blood. Killed lots of them and no option on any. I guess I'll move on to something else until I know it's fixed.
---
Thank you all for this thread. This game is really good, even with its problems. The content that we've seen is phenomenal. I've had more fun in this game than fallout 4. The community-response team and content creators deserve a whole hell of a lot more praise than thus reddit community hands out.
---
I figured :-)  but it's hard to tell over the internet sometimes, and with all the miss information out there for various mental health issues, I tend to try and set the record straight whenever I can. No worries.
---
I ran around picking rhododendrons, but they didn't give flux. Is that normal?
---
Is durability the same as condition?
---
I appreciate not having to chase them around... Sticking them to one spot is a public service.
---
I'm lvl 125 mele build and I'm in and out in 25 minutes after lock picking and hacking through it.
---
If the problem was only with the weapons.
---
VATS, invincibility glitches, HP regeneration glitches, lag issues, teleportation glitches, invisibility glitches...
---
Insert obligatory "IM F2P AND ZOMG I DID ALL THESE IN THE FIRST 5 MINUTES OF GAMEPLAY AND HAVE EVERYTHING IN THE WHOLE ATOM SHOP THAT I BOUGHT WITH ATOMS THAT I EARNED IN GAME FROM THE CHALLENGES AND I'VE ONLY BEEN PLAYING 2 WEEKS AND ONLY PLAY 5 MINUTES A DAY L2P"
---
I really like this idead
---
How you utilize silos, Pvp and play solo or in teams. Gives you alternate versions of said titles Lone Hero, Heros of the Wastes (than factions) graverobbing raider(s), Enclave Enforcers.
---
It is common, they usually mutate, but sometimes the zone gets hit and the flowers won't flux. But most of the time they do and it's a bountiful source of every flux except violet.
---
Yeah I have all the dt perks. My character should be taking hits but nope most enemies can bludgeon me to to death. Especially Robot Steroid Bear X9000 aka Yao Gui
---
I'm on console, and I'd rather not flush 200+ levels down the drain. Thank you for the input though.
---
It’s ok, but eats up a lot of charisma for both wasteland whisperer and Animal Friend and tamed animals don’t stay alive very long. I wish it were easier to keep them alive.
---
Fallout 3, Fallout: New vegas, Fallout 4
---
You can still repair them in a work bench
---
High endurance vaccinated 3 and almost no difference, plus endurance from gear does absolutely nothing not even extra hp...
---
Edit: I’m so glad I didn’t try to go back and reclaim it since I was just disconnected AGAIN (30 minutes-an hour?) after the first time! If this keeps up, I think I’ll just get back on Witcher. This is getting ridiculous.
---
Hmm I guess not so much screenshots, but the photos from your in-game photo gallery. As for how, probably randomised somehow.
---
I played for 30 minutes and got the stopping of my movement and then disconnection 3 times on Xbox. My boyfriend was playing his Xbox upstairs at the same time and it got so bad that he was disconnecting within a couple of minutes of reconnecting so we both gave up playing tonight.
---
Did you have dry kindling?
---
No but it's not far off. I have sold 2 of them for 1.5 and 2k.
---
People are not ripping off anyone. The person selling it invested time and effort into digging up what ever item they are selling from the depths of the rng. The value of the item should factor in that investment since you are saving the buyer the hastle of grinding up westtek or whitesprings for it as well as the usefullness of the item. Furious miniguns are a fairly useful combo for people starting to get into SBQ runs with heavy build.
---
Yeah I hate how fast they hit sometimes, idk how to get tankier. Almost makes a bloodied build the way to go even though I’d rather not
---
Crossbow?
---
Yes.  Not sure which term is correct in the game, but we're talking about the same thing.
---
Damage mitigation is way better than DR in this game. Things like sentinel and cavalier armor, or perks that reduce damage taken
---
Jim Sterling will have to make another video if that is truly Battle Royale. Chances are it's going to be worse BR than Radical Heights.
---
You don't need a repair kit. Just follow the prompts for a workbench repair.
---
Yea I didn’t even think about the probability of someone uploading a malicious file. What if it just drew from the photo gallery in game, similar to how they use them for the load screen?
---
Either way it would be cool, but definitely not at the forefront of needed game features IMO.
---
You, don’t even need to do the mule/alt thing to hit max caps fast. I make anywhere between 5-15k a day JUST selling ammo.
---
Add in the 1,400 daily and caps made from killing and scaving...
---
The biggest “ballers” I know are serum guys making 10-20k A DAY. 
---
One of my buddies does pretty well mainly selling junk to crafters.
---
I had a code to crack but no one could crack it.... I didn’t even think it was that hard lol
---
Honestly I’m happy for you, but what are spending the caps on? Lvl 60 and I don’t think I’ve spent that much the whole time in game? 
---
I guess if you want god level gear that’s what you need to do. But honestly I’m getting bored one-shotting every mob under level 40.
---
you should be more condescending and obvious
---
I've used 5x powered for the longest time. The only ap refresh I run is lone wanderer. I have 200 max ap and Regen it all within 5 seconds from empty.
---
Yao Gui are the devil.  Which has been true since FO3 at least.  OP as mess.  But yeah sometimes i feel like im not wearing any armor even on PA
---
Either one you don’t want I would be interested in buying if you’re on XBOX.
---
Thank you! I have no clue when I’d be able to get on though probably sometime this week but if you can’t hold on to it and you want to sell it or whatever, you can. I appreciate it either way
---
I tried it and it's fun but it makes unlootable loot piles?  what's the point if you can't loot?
---
Okay good for you. And there's some of us that like just collecting legendaries 1 * or not. And as I said before, once again you're missing what I said, I said the chance of a good legendary.
---
I don't understand why you have to be so butthurt that you're calling people jabronies because they don't agree with your method. Seems pretty childish to me.
---
you can repair any weapon at a weapons workbench, repair kits are for when you are away and can not get to one. you can get repair kits from doing the SBQ event or get them from the atom shop.
---
Look at cdkeys I got it for £10 and it's always on sale
---
There's a responders themed skin for excavator coming. It's possible they release some for other factions including the scouts. Time will tell
---
Might be a bug, could be just a display error (which usually resets when you next log in).
---
Some weapons take a bit of use before they start to go down, though most are fairly quick about it.  Keep an eye on it over your next few sessions and see if it doesn't correct itself.
---
If you're using gunsmith perk (or the one for melee weapons, can't remember the name), that reduces the rate at which weapons degrade.  That's the only other thing I can think might be making a difference.
---
Huge amounts of predictable baddies spawn. Often legendary. And so much flux. Plus if you're getting properly fucked the robots kind of distract hordes
---
Yeah feels like I barely have any armor on. Wonder if it's a game breaking bug where the game doesn't register your Dr. Wouldn't put it past Bethesda

---
I bought a one star anti-armor hatchet the other day...
---
Yeah so fix it good allows for 200% condition and increased intelligence says higher durability on items crafted. Thought they were different.
---
Ad Boyardeeum!
---
It’s not bad PvE, horrible in PvP. Anticipate my ass, you’ve got to be right in a deadly opponents face, and make sure they don’t jump, to do damage. It’s like saying you have to fire off 10 shots and aim and unaim down the sights to make your gun work. 
---
Melee is already at a great disadvantage when fighting Stealthboy’d opponents when compared to an explosive gun.
---
google it
---
I did this
---
Yeah. Im helping my friend and its not working
---
this disease garbage is typical BGS idiocy.  i'm starting to hate them.
---
Lol I guess that's what I mean. I love collecting apparel even if I don't wear it
---
You're ignorance is astounding. When you can equip and unequip armor and give yourself unlimited carry weight, or have specific combinations that make you invincible, those are exploits. No different than figuring out how to dupe things. Though you will probably try to justify duping as well. No one is saying that the armor or weapons are the issue. Figuring out ways around the programming is a problem, and therefore an exploit. That's why you can see in every parch notes that Bethesda addresses these exploits. I guess some people like you just want to rationalize cheating.
---
That’s BS, the bug fix for locations is really hosed up for , Cranberry Glade, Hemlock groves etc. I think Bethesda should look at our map data and if it exists then credit the characters.
---
I like the game but I want my Atom Credits!
---
That's a fair compromise I think!
---
if you think they can, you drastically overestimate BGS competency.  These people can't even code a hitbox.  garbage.
---
Is there an easy way to get killed other than in a battle? I tossed grenade on the ground and stood on it, got killed instantly every time and went to the respawn screen, ‘call for help’ was never an option. Wasted 10 plasma grenades for my friend lol
---
 150 rounds fired and not a dent in mine.
---
Possibly the single best feature to add to player vending.
---
We can buy plans, but we can’t easily advertise the mods we can do.
---
Some people only want to buy a mod and not the plan for a jet pack or similar.
---
It’s the same idea behind mutation serums.
---
Please, I honestly do want a battle royale in fallout
---
Why don't you just use the Recent Players tab on Xbox to rejoin?
---
I have plans for sale, what platform are you on?
---
To everybody who thinks I’m either a crazy old woman or trying to rip you off selling “untarnished” or “clean” items: I’m neither. It’s storage for those items until display cases come out.
---
now we have PSA's for what the card already says
---
well done
---
If you’re on Xbox, I can make them if you don’t want legendary ones. 
---
If you have legendary ones but want them upgraded I can do that as well. 
---
Just need materials, let me know.
---
We have shot a lot
---
how about stop worrying about levels and just do quests / explore. Theres nothing good at the endgame
---
Like he said you can repair them just like always, it's just once in inspect mode (at a bench) you can either repair them the old way or use a repair kit. 
---
To answer your question, you can repair them when they are all the way broken or you can repair them when they are a little broken. The normal work bench way that is. 
---
BUT you can't use weapon artisan/fix it good with a repair kit. A repair kit only repairs to 100%.  beyond 100% you need an improved kit, those only drop from the scorch beast queen and will only repair to 150%
---
PSA: Stop telling people to stop telling people how to stop telling people who are stopping people to stop
---
6 months into the game, my answer is a strong and absolute: No.  They are making it worse with every update.
---
Let me know if you see a patern..
---
lol dupers
---
One guy was seeing through walls at whitespringns. There's videos of him moving through mountains near pleasant valley. I'm not witchunting anyone here so no names. 
---
I haven't seen him in a while but my teammate said he was in a discord group with others and he has been seen at least a week ago in game. 
---
Another dude is not using Aimbots or anything but he will shoot his sparkle gun at anyone on the leaderboards. Which is fair game. Except that that when you get him low on health he hits AltF4 real quick to avoid loosing his kill count. He thinks he's some kind of legendary raider but he's a joke.
---
There are others who are hyper good at aiming and one shotting people. I assume most of them are just good players cause I know I'm not good with that twitch aiming. And they are usually fighting each other.
---
Im guessing its just bugged
---
I could go Atom Cats as well..... bring them back, I say.  :)
---
Some people don't actually want to sell that stuff they just want to showcase it. Envy....
---
its around $30 at amazon..... I used this new invention called google to get that much needed information to you that will be $167.76 payable to paypal @mattola69
---
If I could upvote this twice I would
---
Ahh PC...I'm on ps4
---
If I was duping it wouldn't of just been Nuka Colas.
---
Pondering how many steps into inception I just fell and whether my top will stop spinning.
---
I understand the rarity of items and their usefulness, however my number was not far off. I have seen players selling 1* weapons for far more than 3k, and it’s outrageous. 
---
It’s more advice I’m trying to give. Why would I buy this 1* Minigun weapon for 3k when someone else down the road is selling a 2* Minigun weapon for 2k? Same goes for ammo, medicine, etc. 
---
People do have the freedom to price their items however they want, I’m just saying it won’t be efficient at all. 3* god roll weapons prices can be justified as their is a high demand, and low supply. But when you have a common 1* weapon you won’t have as much luck selling it for 3k as you would selling it for 1k
---
What in those games takes 20 bullets to kill besides a behemoth..? (Or in Fallout 4’s case a Mirelurk Queen) especially in F4 which has the same legendary system hahahaha. Here’s another one bound to leave you stupid: If 5 shotting enemies shouldn’t be a thing what’s your reasoning behind melee? I’ve seen builds that go well above 2k damage PER HIT. Why is that good for balance &amp; not TSE’s pre-nerf? (Btw TSE’s pre nerf still had a lower TTK than melee’s...)
---
Question: I know there are perk cards that enhance cripple and weapon effects that either cripple or focus on a limb. 
---
My question is if you specifically want to cripple and have maxed out the cripple perk card for instance do you need to target a specific limb?
---
Can it be any limb? Arms? 
---
I’ve crippled Goulds before but I was never sure what was the cause.
---
I once got killed by a guy with a rolling pin. It was brilliant.
---
Haha yeah that explains it!
---
Thank you!  I said this in another thread and people got all upset with me and humped all over me 🤷‍♀️
---
How long is this going on for? I cant be on for a few hours. Are there any rules? Weapons allowed? Or just fists?
---
You get raw flux which turns into inert flux and you can drink it if not used. 
---
You have to convert it at the chem bench into stable flux which needs a few other items like high radiation fluids and hardened mass...
---
this guy knows
---
I’m having this issue today a LOT. So far, it’s happened 6 times. I had the joy of losing a workshop the first time, so that made me super happy. Idk what is going on, but I’m thinking 76 is just going to have to go unplayed for a while if it happens again.
---
I lost the thread of the main quest months ago. I’m just wandering around and finding stuff out now.
---
The main quest line tells me to “Study Dr Hudson’s work”, but there is no target marked on the map or further description at all. I have no idea where to find this research, what to do with it when I do, and have just moved on. :-)
---
Sorry for the delayed response, blew up my computer this week, so a bit behind...     
---
It's a Push/Pull problem, they clearly are very interested in the viability of the game, seeing issues fixed, new content, etc...  
---
We cry for faster fixes, which results in things slipping between the cracks etc...   
---
Personally I'd like to see both more transparency AND honesty coming from them, as some of the recent "Bugs" were issues previously fixed, meaning it's a Revision Control issue, but it's easy to armchair quarterback.   
---
Regardless they are gaining momentum, and in my case reporting issues and getting attention to them is getting easier since the Community Managers started a dialog.
---
We do that already lol why would I wanna do it more
---
Guns either run 1, 10, 20, 30, and so on or 5, 15, 25, and so forth. 10mm is the latter.
---
genus
---
Hell yeah man good to meet another free aimer. :) Feel free to add me if you ever need another shooter.
---
Just to clarify I don’t have a problem with a non legendary mode...if there is no vats as well. :)
---
I know I keep spamming this, but I don’t care...90% of my kills were with a 1* anti-armor handmade. The rest were nuka grenades and a few 1* lmg kills.
---
 0 two shot/explosive weapon kills. I just don’t like using them and I think the importance of them in pvp is way overrated unless you are fighting pve/“food builds”.
---
 That’s been my experience anyway.
---
Have you seen it in weapons besides the Tesla?  
---
I've only been able to replicate it there.
---
Yeah okay, thanks!
---
I've had this problem before. It has gotten better than when the game first came out though. Hoping they finally patch it so that if an object is green, it will place.
---
We had about 8 people between 3 different groups and one team froze and got booted while the other was still there with no issues. 
---
When they rejoined our group we couldn’t see them even though we all were still in the same nuke area which was weird. (Toxic Valley area) 
---
No fast travel option but only a “join” option. When you pressed join it said that world no longer was available even though they were in it. 
---
Weird glitch
---
Putting it in either or both locations is good....   
---
Now to find a MIRV Grenade to replicate
---
ha ha
---
Those are the same people who can't handle the bloatflies and stingwings, so I lay into them while on top of the barn while they barely chip away at the Squatch until I come over and punch it to death in 4 swings.
---
It's absurd how many people can't figure out why the Brahmin die and we all get crap rewards as a result
---
Sometimes you can log out and log back in, or just server hop to a friend and can place things in those situations.  Never fails when walls bug, maybe it could help your situation.  Are you trying to place a blueprint?
---
An excellent suggestion. Someone should tag the CMs.
---
Green thumb in a nuked whitespring gets you 200+ fluorescent flux
---
Sorry for the delayed response, blew up my computer this week, so a bit behind...   
---
Can you outline the area you wanted the arch?
---
I expect the photo gallery in game is just using local files, which again avoids the issue because they are files you've placed on your machine, not anyone else.
---
I think the local-only version is a neat idea, but it would separate your game from others.
---
They could do pictures stored server-side (have the screenshot send directly at capture time without saving it locally at all). They could hand out say 5 picture slots per person and have micro-transactions for more. It would even be a sensible mtx: you can use more of the server if you pay for it.
---
Have you been living in a vault? Push to talk has been in the game since about the first update
---
I saw this [list](https://imgur.com/a/AR6e7Py) of top 10 items sold so far on the Fallout FB-page
---
Yep me too!
---
yeah, at first you can't find one- then they just rain out of the sky. Yet; you can't scrap them out so anything useful with them. I'll rage across Appalachia until they let me bring my love of Lomography to Wear Virginia!
---
Yeah but $30 is kinda expensive
---
Do them with a preorganized group and stop relying on random people to know what they are doing. They never ever will.
---
My friends and I were having that issue when we would go into elevators at any silo or arktos
---
I found pharma crashing when using the lift.  Reloading then using the map to join the event worked though.
---
Checked all Vendors, ditto.
---
I'd try it. I'd waste hours trying to crack I'd I had to
---
Yeah, such a purified water, screws, crystal, adhesive. No named items like legendary gear, more so survival and crafting items that are consumed often.
---
Sadly, it appears bugged as well. No players were listed under my recents. That was the only thing I could think to try. 😫
---
That make it easier. Glad you like the idea.
---
Sorry for the delayed response, blew up my computer this week, so a bit behind...    
---
\-Good info, will post, has it been this way since the beginning or a new version&gt;?  
---
\-Only seen that w/ other Players, old as hell and frustrating bug!  
---
\-Seen that one a few times myself, I'll include it in my Armor Page when I remake it (hopefully this weekend)   
---
\-Did he Die shortly after you found him, or just fall over after interacting with him?  Curious if it's the old "NPC's Fall over Dead" issue when people spawn in.  
---
\-Which patch did you notice this pop in?   
---
\-Resetting as mentioned above? (aka everything leaves it?)
---
I never said anything about melee, it is too overpowered especially unarmed. I suspect some sort of nerf will be coming for that sooner or later. But in regards to TSE, I think the situation has improved from my standpoint. Being someone who has never got one and has been on the recieving end too many times because of duping. Because of the sheer amount of TSEs in the game they had to be nerfed, and its still not enough as pvp is still broken as hell.
---
And for those of us who have the knowledge, we can make it where others get the items that they can't get easily. I mean why would you buy plans when you aren't going to building that often. I just buy or find plans when it's possible to.
---
I hate that, but it’s good to know it’s not just me then! I wonder what the deal is?
---
Quite a bit of yellow cake and florescent flux, actually. And it's one of the best places to get the flux making components. 
---
Mostly it's the legendary spawns, though.
---
Twice in a row here after attempting to enter. I just wanted to explore, darn it!
---
Get 20% more xp in survival, can steal people's xp in pvp survival if you kill them, but you lose some aid and your junk in survival and small amount of caps if your killed. There's limited traveling in survival also and you show up on the map if you top three highest xp in the server. Whatever xp you leave with applies I think after that day or when you go back into adventure mode. So just store any aid or junk you dont want to lose and stay stealthy, if you like pvp like me survival is a lot of fun.
---
Thanks for the response, some questions..   
---
Is this following a server crash and rollback? (Armor, PowerArmor, Weapons, Recipes Vanishing)  
---
Which Friends list bug?  
---
Different then weight reduction armor not carrying over into PA or is a Perk not working?
---
I don’t believe all that were suspended were duper’s at all! I’m positive many may have picked up items dropped when duper’s weighing a million pounds went into panic mode knowing the ban was coming. 
---
People drop bags all the time and people stop to pick them up... happens literally all the time! But as soon as you took everything in that bag and even if you dropped it all, it still registered as the player having x number of items. 
---
OR.... Duper’s also didn’t do it alone... they needed anchor friends to re spawn in on so even though the player didn’t dupe by a player having or picked up like I mentioned above items in question would have lead to the same outcome. 
---
We also know that there are literally thousands of duped weapons people have received in some way, shape or form. 
---
Somewhere in the data of the account has to be key info that they looked for but they can’t link that source of it to anything... like if you made 100,000 ammo you’d have a shit ton of lead and steel before that... if you didn’t... maybe that’s how you got caught (just an example) 
---
I’m surprised but not shocked that Bethesda hasn’t said anything. 
---
Put a ticket in and ask... at least you’ll know!
---
When you go into a nuked zone, try a hazmat suit instead of Power Armor, and tell us if you notice any difference.
---
Wow, I gotta say, there were some amazing pictures in there that I wouldn't mind having as a loading screen myself. Can't really say which one was my favorite because there were too many good ones in there, but I especially liked the one with the SBQ near the end. Amazing job. :)
---
I think resources will be scarce for nuclear winter which makes sense... less will be able to farm and more trading will be needed.
---
Let's just make it a 2d platformer with rock music and modern vehicles while we're at it. It ain't fallout 5 so it's not like it matter am I right? /s
---
Thanks.....   
---
Would have to think hard, some of the industry "horror stories" of 80+ hour weeks are intimidating.
---
Very common visual bug. You will see scrap components on weapons, healing stats on armor, etc.
---
So its just the PvP guard removed with more death penalty.
---
we need a fix :(
---
While you’re coming off a bit harsh, I do think a lot of people must not have played any MMO during launch, Fallout seems to be suffering from the same stuff. No company that hasn’t launched a huge multiplayer game before is ready for it, even the king of the genre, WoW was a mess for months.
---
I paid a low level 1000 caps to let me kill him for the achievement!
---
I have two random sets of 3* legendary urban and forest scout armor from turning in scrip. 
---
You can get it by turning in stuff you don’t want and selecting 3* armor but of course you could get other stuff as well.
---
The same is happening to me on PS4, it's a gamble every time I enter a building, most times it fine however the game has crashed twice today entering buildings.
---
So nothing. Got it.
---
You can find plans for marine armor in the glassed cavern, in a single train cart on the southwest edge of watoga (it has a skeleton with a smg and .45 ammo next to it), and a building on the northeastern end of harper's ferry (with a big train cart going through it and a guy with a missile launcher on top; the plan might be in one of the display cases in the building)
---
I'm fairly certain that you could have gotten over level 200 since you got suspended on a new account.
---
Getting back the duper is what all the posters like you want, and I hope that never happens, sorry pal.
---
Yeah I know i could do that but i'll still feel bad for killing him :(
---
Shoot me in the face?
---
WV Lumber... farm it daily... too easy! Flatwoods robots, there’s plenty of steel all around!
---
So you’re speaking in terms of PvP? I get your point from that standpoint but imo PvP will never be balanced in a game like this. Also if they ever plan on keeping EVERYONE happy PvP &amp; PvE balancing needs to be separate. Most people (me included) hate PvP, play Fallout for the PvE side of things. Nothing wrong with liking PvP it’s part of the game but balancing the game for both ruins aspects of both. With the amount of enemies you have the kill in PvE for some activities &amp; the fact that durability is lower than any Fallout game 20 bullets to kill something is just a bit much. Especially considering you’ll either have to buy more ammo or make it yourself which then forces you to grind materials. Idk, some things are flawed in this game.
---
At the bottom of a small cliff near the train station at the top of the world there is a huge skeleton that counts.
---
Ahhhhh, that’s right. I was looking for steel nodes in the maps, not iron. Thanks!
---
I hope they reinstate you.
---
Not trying to step on anyone's toes but if the ones who commented first can't mod buttressed or something you want, I can. but I charge 100c per mod.
---
No, no difference. If it is important to you....do it your fuckin self.
---
I didn’t get much traction. I would like to have a king of the hill style with just unarmed weapons
---
Seriously.  It's so damn stupid we can't get it off them and have to hope it shows up in a box randomly.
---
I have yet to complete this event, sadly, because of the 3 attempts (only 2 with a decent amount of people) all failed. Now it seems like no one is trying to do it at all. I guess I’m just SOL here.
---
Hey, thank you! I'm not sure what would happen if you took the pictures and placed them in the my documents my games pictures folders? Who knows maybe a load screen! Thank you for the lovely comment.
---
I’m usually on weekdays, morning and afternoon. I’ll hang on to it for you, let me know if you’ll be on sometime this week, I’ll log on and get it to you I
---
Nah I didn’t feel bad, I killed him then watched his junk as I waited for him to come back. He was real happy about it and I was too!
---
I've put in a ticket which is why I know I've only been suspended for picking up Nuka Cola. I've also put in a ticket asking for an update on the situation and that one has been unanswered for nearly 3 months. :/ All I want is an update to whats going on. Thank you for a reasonably unbiased response.
---
No diffuser is an aoe heal that looks like a really potent bilabial-fricative
---
I hit level 300 10'ish weeks into the game, and have avoided the insanely OP builds,'opting to have more fun (vampires, non low health build) while playing.   
---
Am also a medium sized "trader" so like checking other people's C.A.M.P.'s for good deals, average prices etc, and have blow 75'ish in the last couple weeks since Player Vending was introduced.
---
I saw a bunch of scrap in a suitcase last night, probably left by a player. I picked it all up and it had 455 steel scrap. I noticed after I went to my camp to bulk and sell it, that it had doubled itself in my inventory. 
---
I have no idea what's going on anymore.
---
Core assembly is power armor right ?
---
boards and pipe rifles don't mean anything, damage is dictated by the level of the enemy. level 68 warlord with a board will deal much more damage than a lower level assault rifle. Also, unarmed scorched deal about as much damage as an equal level deathclaw :)
---
As for DR, it works as a ratio in this game. You get about 50% resistance to an attack when your DR is equal to the damage you're taking. It slowly goes up or down beyond that, with far less effectiveness. To block out 80% damage for most high level enemies, you would need way over 1000 DR
---
Ever heard of administrative silence?
---
My under armor (BoS or Enclave, can’t remember which) also clips through the bomber jacket in a bunch of places.
---
That's too bad. Guy on ps4 had one too with a ring and prizes and stuff but think it fizzled too. Remember reading post about it.
---
70, at 288
---
If you got the collectors Edition i have good and bad news for you.
---
Others - nope. But don't worry, in the first weeks you better of exploring the forest area.
---
Hey, we love the game, least we can do is help each other out.

"Mothman"?

Brother have you heard the good word of "Rose"?   
---
Death could not stop her, after death she rejoined the world of the living clad in a metal shell of perfection, she is my Savior.
---
My account was not new. I played since launch. Even if it war roughly 3 months, I'd still like to not flush my progress down the drain. I don't understand the phrase, "Getting back the duper." I wish I could show you my inventory so you could've clearly seen I wasn't a duper though. :/ I was struggling to keep up on shotgun shells alone. lol
---
As I said, some are written in such a minuscule way that you can’t even read them, text is all buggy. SPOILER—&gt; You can expect a new Power Armor, the opening of Vault 51, you becoming the overseer till rank 186 (for now, maybe ranks are related to the Battle Royals mode ?), finding a girl waiting outside Vault 51 (female bot I guess/or the first NPC), new attachments, new Nuclear Winter bosses and camo paints. These are the readable ones for now. Some of them are really incomprehensible
---
Without pvp what is the future of 76? Another farming run around the white spring and checking on your mutfruit. At this point the apocalypse looks like joining the scouts and being a tourist.
---
It’s the fools who are doing all the talking while others work hard. Well wishes to you have a great memorial weekend fellow wastelander.
---
Thats fair, I havent tried to play PVP since probably december because everytime I get destroyed by a TSE. Its frustrating. Its interesting to think of seperate balancing, not sure how that would work.
---
Unless you bought the collectors, no map for you
---
I forgot to add that im on PS4, I looked every where in the Ultracite ammo and cant find it
---
I'm holding out hope myself. Thank you for the kind words!
---
I've tryed everything to combat this myself,serindipity max rank is worth it and helps I run a bloodied build with full unyielding armor and I've had some weird deaths from low level enemy's.
---
I haven't had much luck selling junk, and pretty much stopped. I don't think I was pricing it too high, since it was just above what I can get from a shop with Hard Bargain 2, so well below what the shop sells it for. Maybe I wasn't selling the right things.
---
Also, I try to keep plenty in reserve for myself, so by the time I get to the point of selling some, it's because I'm running out of space, so bulk sitting in my vendor doesn't help that.
---
Maybe I'll try again.
---
?   
---
I added it to the QoL/Tinfoil.. Section
---
Very true...
---
...I really thought this was just common knowledge cause it literally says on the card what it does. Yikes
---
I have not. Please enlighten me.
---
for endless hours of fun and excitement and a way to make new friends.... oh ok
---
Do you hear that noise?...that's the sound of atoms dropping...
---
Ohhh. for some reason I thought you were saying they added that feature.
---
Make a note of 3-5 player names who have vendors open or have workshops claimed. Then you can use them to rejoin the server.
---
I got the game on release but never really played much 'cuz I got bored playing alone. I am only lvl 11 or 12 I think. I am going to sleep soon so I wont be playing today but I am free tomorrow :D, i am also from eu
---
I did I looked for the materials Needed for it and I have all if them,  but it isnt there I re-checked it dozens of tims
---
I agree that they should address it! I’d put another ticket in then contact Bethesda Support on Twitter and openly ask them why your ticket is being blatantly ignored and give them the ticket number when you do. 
---
Telephone support literally only tells you to put in a ticket and offers nothing else.
---
Welcome home neighbor.
---
I would give you 7k for it
---
The negatives are unwanted people in my house...
---
...ok, so. There are walkthroughs for all these things out there.
---
Had this issue today.  Always failed at the same bouy, completed it finally by swimming to that bouy first, then on to the others.  Was getting annoyed!
---
I meant that as soon as you got suspended, on a new account you could have gotten as far as on your suspended one or even farther. Getting back the other toon just for the sake of it is pretty weird, when there are no classes, races or anything, you could have just made a clone of the one you lost and keep playing. You'd be close or over the level of the previous one.
---
And probably have even better gear since updates brought new stuff.
---
It's not "a bit deal" or a "small deal". People are asking for bulk ammo. That's all. It doesn't affect your prices one iota. You can still sell for 1c each to your heart's content, even if they get their way. But they'll be able to easily undercut you. Which they fucking should, because for example 5mm at 1c each is a travesty, considering the rate of fire the minigun has.
---
Nothing makes more fun than bashing a SB with a paint can. At least the first few hits.
---
I've run the event a dozen times and gotten unique rewards twice. If you give a shit about a random 3 star legendary more than you do your entire team of people completing the event then you should be the one not playing. 
---
I bet you never took pylons either. Dick.
---
I have to disagree. I have found, all in player vendors for less than 5k each. FE handmade, AAE assault, BE pipe bolt action, AAE gatling gun, and IE double barrel. I've resold all of them and made ALOT of caps.
---
unitialized integer
---
Who tf use grenades lol
---
Not really it's just hard
---
Should I take the quad I have for sale down or raise the price some more?
---
Damn I'll just print it off it's fine😂
---
Yeah PvP in this game will never be in a good place imo. Most guns even post-nerf can one shot you &amp; melee’s if nerfed big will make all enemies in PvE bullet sponges which makes for a boring experience. We’ll have to see👌🏼
---
I enjoyed reading that too much. You have a great sense of humour!
---
Mama Dolce. A front for red communism. 😂
---
Yes. My blueprinted base was on a cliff side &amp; now I’m trying to mount it on top or to the side of my mountain base &amp; it just won’t place no matter what
---
Yes it does stack. So if you have all 5 pieces with Assassin Legendary modifier you’ll have a 75% chance to reduce 40% damage from players.
---
Dick Shale disapproves.
---
Yeah if it was red there wouldn’t be an issue but it’s green which means it should place 100% of the time. I’ll live, just server hop &amp; see what happens I guess!
---
In my defense when it happened I read, "Suspension will be lifted in a future update." I figured it would be an update sooner rather than later. I understand hindsight is a bitch, and I probably should've just made a new toon. Thank you for the input.
---
How thirsty are players?
---
...either you replied to the wrong person, or you didn't read my reply properly.
---
Were you in survival because just staying in pacifist in adventure during events is enough too fix this as it's only an issue upon pvp engaging.
---
If you're on pacifist then they don't hurt you. The queen killed you.
---
That, I can understand. Though the way I like this game I couldn't have been over 1 week without making a new account if I were in your place :P
---
I can’t tame a fox... otherwise this would be different.
---
I found one in a footlocker at Kiddy Corner Cabins. They're around, but there seems to be no practical way to farm them at this point.
---
Yeah... I guess I should do those ...
---
I use them just to destroy the mainframe cores in the silos.
---
Not sure what you mean
---
The organization has really gone to shit by 2102.
---
Since player vending came out I've noticed something. In game prices are WAY better than the Reddit markets. 
---
I bought a bloody explosive harpoon gun for 650 caps. They sell on Reddit for 25000 or more. Bloody explosive gauss, 3k in game. 25k on Reddit.
---
Sure, you gotta look around. Might take a couple days to find a good deal. But, I'm fucking done paying Reddit prices. wont pay more than 5k for God role stuff anymore.
---
Right. So lets say I play on a screen 1920x1080. My friend however never liked those screens, uses 1650x1050 resolution. Now you have a problem. Then, don't forget that the screenshot is saved somewhere as an image.   
---
So lets say I post the first image here as a screenshot...  [https://imgur.com/a/xtrTaNh](https://imgur.com/a/xtrTaNh) and then replace it with the second. Every. Single. Leftist. Freak. Will. Spam. Them. That's nothing though, what if instead I start replacing the images with porn. Suddenly, it's an 18+ game. Then I start using this logo [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Montreal\_Canadiens.svg/1200px-Montreal\_Canadiens.svg.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Montreal_Canadiens.svg/1200px-Montreal_Canadiens.svg.png) and booom, they get pestered by take down requests.   
---
So the F team can slowly but surely do the image fitting. A college grad could. It's what comes along with it that's a problem. F-teams don't manage that.
---
How... what?
---
Aren't the spike board traps non lethal when unpowered? I have about a dozen of them, mostly so I can blend punji boards in on an incline - can't have them floating!
---
This game is pretty unique as far as players go. Most people want to help. I was running whitesprings earlier at level 55 and a high level tried to team up to help me, and even messaged me. On my high level character, my favorite thing to do is help a low level player join the Enclave. My stepson plays online a lot, but not this game. He was blown away the other day when he watched me play because people were waiting patiently in a line for a vendor. I play only PvE, and I look at it as “us” vs the environment. If I can spare something, I’ll happily give it away to a lower level.
---
Lol they're not even that good
---
&gt;typical
---
&gt;starting to

Follow the non-main quests some. Should get one to go up to Grafton. Should also have one to find Overseer caches. Explore, kill, loot, craft. COOK.
---
It really do be like that
---
Is it a murder fest. Mostly wondering if everyone is hungry for kills.
---
Doesn't each piece have an individual chance to proc now? They don't all activate at once
---
You’d have to bring them back like 200 years. They don’t exist yet in FO76
---
If you're a hardcore player, you can make about 7k caps per account in a day. 14k if you got a mule account. I understand some people are having trouble collecting caps(like me) but there are people out there who can make tens of thousands within like three to four hours of gameplay. So 50k for an item is justified

Radworms. Radworms never change.

Stop by the magic fountain at Whitesprings. It cures diseases for free.
---
What platform?
---
I admire your love for the game, and wish I had the same resolve to start from complete scratch.
---
Just block them and move on.

The only people that point out karma like it means something are trolls and assholes that can't get validation in real life. They're not worth giving a damn about.

Alot of people are not doing it cause it's laggy as hell when there's group of people in it or will crash , BUT it's not difficult to solo it I do it 10+ times a day by myself that way you don't lag at all, plus the boss it's a bullet sponge but I can still down it in less than 1 minute so not that bad...
---
pubg literally has none of those either.
---
Not quite, it's 5 individual chances to reduce damage by 8% each. It's unlikely to get the full 40% reduction but it's far less likely to get none of it
---
Crap if you're sick.
---
Yup, this \^. I actually pick up the extra bloodbug probiscus, the extra stingwing barbs, the extra bloatfly glands and the tic blood sacs and save them in my stash so that when i redo the quest daily i can just grab them out of my stash and only have to get the radroach meat. Another possibly helpful tip - theres a locked door in there where you get the quest , pick the lock or just marsupial over the wall and there is almost always a radroach in there that drops meat thereby making it that much quicker.
---
The only way I'd play it is if they gave me atoms for it
---
It was meant to be a joke but I probably should have put /s
---
And with exactly 7 mutations
---
I'm in the UK my game name is rych1981 hit me up if you wanna do some quests etc. I've been playing since Christmas, still discovering things but pretty much know what I'm doing now....
---
Handmades are rare though and bloodied explosive even more so, so some people are willing to get even just a bloodied one. This is not the same for all weapons. The handmade is just top tier.
---
I am Lol, I like taking xp and basically leveling up quick if I can manage to stay alive
---
I'm fairly certain they are dead and I'm also fairly certain that they make great night lights :)
---
So when you solo. You dont fill any feeders then just kill the main room boss?
---
Even knowing there's a cable powering the machine, it can still be difficult to determine which direction to follow it!
---
Be cool if you could through paint cans,...lol
---
No not server crash related it's when you log out then next time you log in it's gone. Also it doesn't stay consistent and then noticed yesterday that I can pull a weapon from my stash, but I won't be able to put it back when I'm done. Also nothing gets added to my stash in between when I take it and try to put it back
---
I'm still able to play, but it's just annoying having lag sometimes
---
Yes , each pieces has a 75 % chance to proc. Not as good as it was before but still best pvp armor imo especially if you can get a sentinel assassin or cavalier assassin.
---
Think I’ll start doing this too. I like traveling to find rare items for my vending machines.
---
Some servers have more pvp than others I noticed.. not everyone like the pvp. It likes the extra xp
---
Check out gatling lasers. Fusion cores are pretty easy to come by and with the right perks and the right gun you'll do some impressive damage.
---
Also, with player vending you do have access to good heavy weapons and ammo at the lower levels. This is a good time to start a new character.
---
But you can't say they are not good you don't even have to aim. It's basically Vats with no ap cost and you can hit multiple people at the same time
---
PvE is PvP gonna skin me some carebears. How about this for crafting, tan your ass into a pair of boots so I can kick your ass when I kick your ass.
---
Awesome! I took the same picture of that super mutant sitting!
---
My gunslinger guy. Took a couple points to make nuka nades. Really helps when "punching above my weight" or just catching a group is very satisfying.
---
I think it’s going to be arena battles like quake.
---
And no canvas.
---
Ahhh makes sense now!
---
no, just decide if punji boards can deal damage, then players can destroy them. Otherwise they can't deal damage.
---
In Fallout 4 they added arcade cabinets. I hope and pray that they bring this back and that they allow the machines to display the top 5 high scores. I could see people just traveling from camp to camp trying to get as many high scores as possible.
---
Junk launcher, making a return?
---
=D =D
---
The interesting thing is at end game pvp two people will be doing 0 damage to eachother until one of them doesnt have serendipity go off or they run out of ap for dodgy 3 and then they die in that one hit
---
He's famous now haha
---
Thank you so much! I can definitely be on sometime this week in the morning for sure. My psn is queen_of_psychos
---
It does build vats, or atleast it does for me, there is a rifle perk that gives a higher stagger change but if you really want to destroy a sentinel you need a fast fire gun such as a mini gun or Gatling laser/plasma and a stealth boy so they can’t vats you
---
Yea I’ve had it fixed before but can’t retreat it
---
If you're trying to grab a console copy, check Mercari. It's like Ebay, but I saw copies on there for 17 bucks-ish
---
Yeah I wonder if it’s because of all the crashes or if people don’t feel like wasting their time.. whatever it is it really sucks
---
For what it's worth, the only real instability I've had is when I've joined my brother. When he joins me, we haven't had any significant issues.  We've also noticed the people on my servers are generally nicer - I've had one or two jerks since beta, and he encounters them almost daily. 
---
We live about 25 miles away from each other - he's right next to a major city, and I'm pretty middle-of-nowhere. I suspect that's putting us on different servers or possibly even data centers.
---
As long as they haven't blocked you, you can add anyone you want to your friends list and should be able to hit their name then hit "Join" to join their server (they might need to accept the friend request). It might be worth adding a couple people from other regions just to do that and see if it helps. You don't join their team when you join their server, so besides knowing that they exist on the world there's no real difference.
---
Huh that’s odd, when I shot him in vats it showed the damage but immediately jumped back to his full health and didn’t affect my crit meter. Maybe it was just bugged
---
If your on ps4 you must press all 4 main buttons  to repair an triangle square x circle. Triangle triangle x square I believe to use a repair kit.
---
*you're
---
Gross. Old people music.
---
I dont see it as a failure, they're letting us decide what to sell things for. The value of everything entirely depends on what its worth to you and its great.
---
Pvp is always bugged :/ if you vats crit a sentinel with a rifle they would most likely die
---
Other online games have had similar systems. 
---
I wouldn’t say 0%.
---
I like to fill the toxic sludge one I can get that one up to rank 2 that makes it easier cause the spawn creature is stronger and only keep that one alive it's in zone B and down the boss and complete the event...
---
Mods.
---
Never said anything about using Tesla rifles, someone sound salty about a stealthboy user.
---
What you scrubs don't get is no one claims stealthboys take skills, however since anyone can drop someone with a vats crits very quickly obviously the community is going to counter it. The only difference I have while fighting someone who's using stealthboys is that I have to free aim. They aren't hard to track and I'd honestly venture to say vats crits are cheaper and stealthboys.
---
added you!
---
How cool would it be if certain areas of the world had plots of land close to each other that you could claim with your CAMP instead of the circle?  Have actual neighbors, with persistent houses?  And you could collectively donate resources to upgrade amenities for the entire town, such as walls, turrets, or resource collectors?  Some town with a single fast travel area in it to prevent players from loading into the actual structures people are building, that allows a more limited budget CAMP that you can use to build a neighborhood?
---
alright pm me your username if you want :)
---
75% chance is for all piece is either you have 40% when it's proc or 0 when it don't, it's the same with sentinel.
---
It's fallout just play. I've been playing alone since launch and have never had a problem. I treat it like a solo game that everyone wanted, just like fallout 3 or 4.
---
It's a really relaxing way to play to be honest.
---
What am I doing with my life, picking flowers in a video game?
---
Little did I know that I would come to fondly remember those challenges.
---
Love the tactical chef look!  But, ya gotta tell us you carry a rolling pin, and also what legendary effects it has...
---
Also forgot to mention the friends list doesn't show people on their that I'm friends with and they play the game.
---
Cool, I'll accept hen I'm next on, hopefully tomorrow 😎
---
I have probably 25 or 30 from events that I have just been using to use them and save repair materials. Not ever gonna buy any. Don't need them, but having them has been convenient.
---
no if they add br games dead
---
Be prepared for lots of death in survival mode. With loss of caps and junk.
---
It really is dude, sometimes vats just doesn’t notice the enemy even though they are red and not crouched, in plain sight. Gets pretty frustrating haha
---
Just jump over the board ? I do it all the time
---
I kinda like that there are still a few PvP trolls who don't have the memo about Adventure mode, where lack of slap damage and building damage means they just look like tools as they try in vain to provoke people.
---
Indeed which Is why I went the route of: shoot in their general direction with extreme force and they die
---
I’d rather have it enter my inventory precisely because of bugs like the one where the ISS would leave behind an invisible corpse.  I did that event dozens of times but rarely got to the boss’ body to loot it.
---
The game can’t handle one person on the screen at one time how is it gonna handle multiple people?
---
I curious what it is about this game that causes so many people to have that kind of attitude.  Player generosity and courtesy seem to be a given, not an exception.  I wonder if Bethesda has any way to track or monitor interactions like this, look at how many brown paper bags were dropped by 'x' level or higher player to 'y' level or lower in the vicinity of Vault 76, for example.
---
Part of the problem I have is figuring out what exactly to share.  (known) plans seems to be a given, but what about healing salves, purified water and canned stew?  Kind of makes me want to open up a ~~Loaves and Fishes~~ 'Sweet Rolls and Mirelurks' charity outside Vault 76, positioned to freely give away lower level weapons, ammo and supplies to the newbies emerging from the Vault.
---
I’ll keep an eye out for you!
---
yeah they earned their name
---
I can play 76 just fine without PvP... but that's what's great about the server split - now people can just play how they want without feeling constrained by the other playstyle.
---
Pretty sure it's invulnerable?
---
Is that true? Ugh. Bethesda, whyyyyyyyyyyy? You’re gonna get either crickets or laughter, not applause. Lordy.
---
Thats been happening a lot lately.  Waste almost all my ammo and nothing to show for it.
---
depends on what kinda sick i get if i'm getting the quirts or not
---
Seen them at harpers ferry vendor
---
I've never seen one there either. Pretty much the only body of water big enough to hold it would be that lake south of the tunnel connecting the heap to the cranberry bog, but I've only ever seen some mirelurks around it.
---
wait, is that a nude mod? I thought it was just the nuka girl outfit
---
I don't see why we need to overthink this: why not just have it so that the price you set in your vendor is the price for the whole stack of whatever you have. So if I put 500 rounds of ammunition for 250 caps, it would cost 250c for the whole stack of 500, not 250c per bullet. Honestly not sure why it wasn't implemented this way in the first place. Sure it's less efficient with vendor slots, but we get 120 of em, I can spare it.
---
What perks are you using to have the damage so high?
---
Nice try but you failed
---
Yeah, it's a nude mod.
---
Rifle and Pistol perks.
---
If the data-mining holds true, it is... but despite hating pvp in general I'll be fine if it's presented the way the leaks suggest it will be.
---
&gt;!Part of a vault experiment around choosing an overseer gone haywire, the original players dead and a rouge AI seeking to continue the experiment with players.!&lt; That seems Fallout-y to me.
---
Both will count?
---
I guess I shouldn't be surprised, the game's been out for quite a while at this point. I just didn't expect it
---
Nuka
---
Yes.  
---
With Adrenaline the damage goes up to 1k+
---
When people stop bitching about not getting to tag an enemy, I'll take this post seriously.
---
Man, ive been doing my shit all wrong
---
I never had problems with the loot before, just the enemies.
---
I got tired of them all being left open its a pet peeve of mine that I have to get on to my kids about all the time. Lol
---
People helped you? I have done it and I am always alone. Keeping them alive by yourself is so hard.
---
Any idea how often the cap pool resets?
---
I'm on PC. I'm used to the occasional bug with enemies disappearing before I can loot them, but that seems to be fairly rare. Would have hoped at least one of the Queen's would have dropped something!
---
It spawns on a hill near Welch if you nuke it. The only time I've ever seen one there and that was months ago.
---
Every 24 hours at a set time. Not sure exactly when though
---
Yes. Yes please. You just may be on to something...
---
Wat
---
why?
---
I was curious about this too, it turns out you only lose durability/weapon condition when you hit an enemy. This gets even weirder - if your weapon has multiple projectiles, each one that hits an enemy will degrade your weapon (it’s why Two Shot Weapons are less durable, and why the beam splitter on laser guns makes them break super fast). Also, if your weapon is explosive and hits multiple enemies, it will degrade for each enemy hit regardless of trigger pull. Weird way to calculate weapon durability but hey it’s Bethesda lol
---
Make sense
---
Well the nuclear winter hypothesis states that, in the event of an all out nuclear war, the large amounts of fallout in the atmosphere would block out the sun, causing, what is essentially, a second ice age. So likely. After all the name “Wild Appalachia”, refers to the large amounts of wild/feral creatures (silky radstags and sheepsquach), ghouls (the burrows), and robot (imposter sheepsquach), that were introduced in the dlc wave. It’s very likely that this same logic can be applied to the “Nuclear Winter” dlc wave.
---
For my sniper build i should have been using a pipe pistol...i didnt know that rifle and pistol perks would stack like that for it
---
So it’s not each individual. It’s if all procs or none ?
---
there are areas where Addictol spawns in the world. one of them is in watoga locked behind a master locked door (3) in the same area is a mini nuke, power armor, fusion generator, laser rifle. the Addictol has a chance to be another chem, but its a common spot
---
I'm the opposite. Whenever I see a CAMP that's locked, I try my hardest to get into it. Workbenches and chairs near windows or the brick windows that you can jump through are great.
---
I just enter their CAMP and leave some fertilizer on the bed, sofa, mat etc. Then I fast travel away.
---
it's not that I have a problem, it's just that I prefer to play in a group.
---
Same, Did it once and got one but not another
---
Unless they fix the perks, it's pretty darned close to it.
---
Hello everyone!!! I have always wondered about this very same thing..... do mods actually exist for this weapon??? Can anyone confirm? I have had the plan for this Weapon for awhile, and I have never gotten any mods from scraping. I really wish someone knew the answer.
---
But the xp is good! 2x better then mothman after eating canned stew. Plus fast travel is a death sentence. I just sneak around trying to do missions and kill supermutants.
---
If the server is full you prob never have to worrie about showing up on the map. I lived for 90 minutes just raking in xp till i got greedy and traveled to the train station. If there was no leader board i would only play survival!
---
Or you jump of the cliff they built over that's always fun.
---
Yeah they just started dropping as legendaries...captain noob made a video so everyone will want one now.
---
&gt;they just look like **tools** as they try in vain to provoke people.
---
I like to RP as Tim the Toolman and I literally sneak up and drill/hacksaw other players for max unflagged dps. Once they notice me I switch to using fire to obscure their shots. The build is overall designed for Siege damage. Mostly I just build a lot and piss off my neighbors.
---
Thanks a ton
---
2000 or so. I've only bought a few things for the camp so far. Waiting for one or two items to go on sale, but most things don't interest me.
---
Be careful. The plain old pipe pistol doesn’t benefit from both perk card types. It’s the pipe revolver rifle and pipe bolt-action rifle (both rifle modded stocks) that benefit from both rifleman and pistol perks. What you see in the screenshot above is the pipe revolver modded with a rifle stock (making it a pipe revolver rifle if it didn’t have a custom name).
---
Ballistic fiber and screws  I tend to buy lots of screws and ballistic fiber as-long as it's cheaper then the vendor bots. I turn it around and make lots of shielded enclave or bos underarmor for sale
---
Worth every penny if you long for some new fallout.
---
Nerf bloodied melee builds and melee in general first, but I would love this gameplay effect as well
---
Gotcha, that part i figured...thanks
---
Lol. Totally a Wile E. Coyote moment.
---
That has happened on xbox for me as well. Even after i dunped a few clips in the boss, body is there i hit them i know i had a part in killing it and ill search them and find nothing. But all the minions will be loaded with pre war monies and rad aways. I have gone from loving this game to hating it, back to loving it but im on the fence, if they do one more big Oopsie im prolly gonna call it quits. The bugs are not game breaking ....for me. Fuck... Im sorry i forgot what i was talking about im not gonna lie.. I'm pretty high right now... I hope your bug works itself out or they fix it though.  Sucks wasting the ammo, weapon conditioning, stimpacks, armor conditioning, for no loot. Sorry i couldnt be better help man. Good luck.

I meant class freak not starched genes

23.7% chance of 40% DR

You are getting at least 16% DR exactly 98.4375% of the time.  Not too bad.
---
When will this event take place?
---
9:00 est tonight
---
Or at least let us make handcars where we can push the levers up and down to move the car.  Let it make you super vulnerable so that it would encourage group use. Have one or two people to use the car and the rest to defend.
---
Diseases arnt to much of a problem the ones I hate are dysentry and parasites the rest I don't even notice.
---
If you dressed like Tim I'd find that amusing. Just make sure you fire off quotes fill of misplaced machismo.
---
Not anymore. Since when? I’m not sure. But over repairing your armor no longer ‘buffs’ it either.
---
^it ^means ^no
---
it used to be - .5 per special stat, but now it seems as if the game cannot go below -1
---
Can't get this to work what exactly did you do?
---
Yes and no. It makes the sneak buff upon disappearing stronger. Chameleon mutations gives "magnitude" 100 effect, chameleon armor gives "magnitude" 20 each. This is the same effect as on escape artist perk card
---
Its better to go for the effect as in sneak perk card, increase base sneak instead of going for buff bonus.
---
Yes, 5x chameleon is more sneaky than 1x chameleon, but less sneaky than 1x chameleon +2x harder to detect while sneaking.
---
I finally joined a discord server - I'm not into Role Playing, but there's bodies in them looking for the same thing. From nukes, SBQ, Arkos, and ISS - it's great to get able bodies into an event.
---
yikes,  last night i rage quit cuz some duo idiots decided to watch me fight a super mutant and scorch beast and die,  just to loot my 35 acid
---
Yup thank goodness for bird bones and I hugged the wall and hit a small ledge that wasn't at death height lol it was over in Seneca rocks.
---
Are you trying to kill an enemy with a rapid firing and/or automatic weapon? That can easily trigger this old “bug.” Only way around it currently is to not fire so fast (burst fire slowly instead of holding down the trigger for example). I have a few weapons in storage that I simply can’t use because they fire too fast. Either way, please add more detail.
---
The fountain in the gazebo by the golf area. Every drink cures one disease. That area also spawns deathclaws, scorpions, and honey beasts.
---
Display bug, sell something to the vendor and it will refresh to show the correct amount.
---
It's happening to trying to go up the elevator to the 2nd floor on the Top of the World mission.
---
Fast travel to WS resort. Go in the bulldog. Once in the building fast travel directly into the basement of Pharma by selecting the event “octagon” marker instead of using the elevator. This has always worked for us.
---
Neither did Super Mutants ......
---
What if their waiting to add that in with faction wars/customizable factions?
---
I know, I looked at all the "lore" around it. I don't know a single fallout player that wants a battle royale mode.
---
Same. Still don't know if there's a propper work around.
---
Temporary Expeditionary Node - Tactical-class
---
Probably wasn't suppose to be funny, but gave me a laugh. I'd rather hear it from them though. Thank you for the witticism.
---
sorry 9:30
---
He was so cute when I caught him, but now he's just sad and ugly squished into that jar.
---
Can confirm
---
Is this still bugged?  Or did someone find a workaround?
---
Sweet I’ll try that, thanks!
---
Nobody will play a BR in a game where PvP doesn't even work to begin with.
---
I just hit 7000. I've bought a couple of items from shop, but overall items from atom shop just not in my style (I don't like or use PA, but bought blackbird back in the day). It's wasteland, and I don't feel like it needs more clowns with plastic bats what is there already.
---
I mostly use a Tesla rifle or Gatling gun. Maybe spam clicking with the Tesla gun may start this bug. Which weapons are you avoiding?
---
As an older player, I think these challenges -- like achievements in other games -- are ridiculous activities. WTF do these challenges have to do with questing and exploring? They're just arbitrary busywork. If you enjoy it, good for you. But I say no thanks.
---
Wish we could build one in our camp.
---
Nice, thanks
---
That went well. We need a " go team reddit" emote.
---
Has anyone tried 4524. I dont play but im curious
---
expressing an opinion that others shouldn't express their opinions because you disagree with them
---
good luck with that
---
I always being the one who protect the cow in the last stage, missed two or three sheepsquash, just see how others melt the sheep, very rewardful
---
Would all my rifle perks work with it too?
---
Again, no one was actually invincible and the fact that you think so means you are lacking in knowledge which is the literal definition of ignorance.
---
If you get healing factor as a mutation, you don’t need much in the way of healing unless you’re directly in a fight. I stop by the overseer’s camp and drop off aid items, grenades, and spare ammo. I’ve given away a lot of legendary weapons as I encounter someone that’s level appropriate (usually 35). Fallout has always been a single player experience until this game, but it had a big following. I think everyone is just happy to share excess stuff and show off what they’ve built or skills they’ve acquired. Plus, this only helps people have a good experience at lower levels, which leads to more players staying around.
---
If you read my post I talk about survival and imbalances with weapons/armor a lot of which caused by rampant duping.  People like myself who didn't dupe are left in the dust for the most part or having to play 1 specific spec.
---
If this mode has no legendaries that could be cool, or if there is a balance of items the PVP in that mode could actually be pretty good.  Survival is mainly broken because of duping exploits, it should be very hard to near impossible to be running around in all god roll items.  Most people wouldn't even have 1 or 2.
---
I would love that!
---
&gt; the majority of complaints from initial release were wrong or gone.
---
But then they will realize there are all these other issues that were introduced in the last couple of patches and still not fixed, and are going to make another ten youtube videos talking about how bethesda sacrifices infants at their HQ
---
Yeah, a lab coat would probably be the best compromise.
---
Not gonna lie I get raped by the stingwings in Project Paradise \*staggers\*
---
*Calls strangers in the internet "scrubs"... for disagreeing with him.Ssomehow how feels accomplished and better about himself. Lmao
---
Why can't we PILOT the Vertibots?
---
I have 2 from drops. From... Somewhere? I have no idea where they appeared from. I've never done the SBQ fight. I must be getting them from events.
---
Inside whitesprings it would. One room should be a casino
---
If they have a BR in the works I doubt they are going to back out now however it's not going to be the only new content to come out so I wouldn't worry about it.
---
At this point I think I've never NOT had radworms.
---
It must be getting crowded in there tbh.
---
Just do what I do:
---
* Go to Slocum's Joe in the Forest;  
---
* Equip your Green Thumb perk;  
---
* Start harvesting Firecaps;  
---
* When you've got about 30 Firecaps (takes like 5 minutes if you know where to look) start heading south along the creek towards Flatwoods;  
---
* Pick Bloodleaf and Snaptail Reeds along the way;  
---
* Once you've got about 30 each of those, collect dirty water from the creek;  
---
* Head to the church in Flatwoods and equip your Chemist and Super Duper III perks;  
---
* Find the chemistry bench behind the vendor bot and start crafting Disease Cures.
---
Voila: you now have between 30 and 40 disease cures. Keep a few on you and place the rest in your vending machine.
---
Easy peasy.
---
lol
---
One of the things though is that those youtubers are keeping people from playing.  When they get their hands on the actual game their own opinions from playing will outweigh the terrible youtubers for the most part.
---
Because that was never implimented into the game so it'd be a whole new mechanic but in fallout 4 you could actually call them to pick you up and bring you places
---
So there you can see that the armor effect don't stick with the Perks :)
---
You can place things in commonplace containers. Popular locations include whitespring train station, any container by the stash. Other places are Watoga train station etc.
---
I rarely get kicked or even experience any of all the infamous bugs so publicly addressed. It’s so wild to me seeing everyone going through all of that while I’m just chillin in the Appalachia shooting Big Mean Bats
---
It dose. I think I have done it a dozen or more times and got 5 badges. One of them was from last night. I check the machine at the end of the event to see if one dropped.
---
They have their own little economy. The majority on the other hand sell for what they feel like.
---
Do the rest. The behemoth is probably a random defense enemy from one of the workshop. There is none in the wild in the ash heap.
---
Have all colours and except red I think just the hat I have
---
Sadly, this type of challenges are intended only to stimulate daily logins, not to provide atoms to players. Threat daily challenges as lootbox with 5 items. Some of them impossible with your playstyle, and some can be salvaged. Very subtle casino. You're stimulated to login to play a game, not to win something.
---
nope you are not alone
---
No I'm referring to people that complain about stealthboy users and insult them, while not using them themselves. You can't decide not to use an item or tactic in a game, then complain it's not fair when others do. That's being a literal scrub in every meaning if the word.
---
Can't wait for my cryo cryolator.
---
I'm done with you and this conversation. Even Bethesda admitted to this exploit.
---
If it’s like everything else, it’s not cumulative like that, it is additive. So you might get your 80%, plus a percentage of your 50%, or vice versa. So your final fall percentage might max out at 90% or so. I’m not sure of the exact figures.  AA effects and other effects work the same way.
---
Appreciate the help. I'll probably mess around with it a bit. It's not easy deciding on a good build lol
---
Plasma infused plasma thrower should be sweet
---
Fallout Battle Royale should be its own game.
---
Yeah but what I'm saying is that one day, in a perfect future where all of the bugs have been squashed, servers are stable and dupers have been banned - imagine if there was a quest where you had to find a downed Vertibird, repair it and get it functional and then actually be able to control it! 
---
Could carry a squad and have 2 player controlled door  gunners. 
---
This is a pipe dream of mine.
---
Xbox, ps4 or pc because my fix on Xbox was to clear my reserve space for fallout and start up the game again RESERVE space please don’t accidentally clear your save data.
---
Just play hit level 50 and enjoy
---
What build uses 15 endurance? Just curious.
---
Still bugged.  Tried it again yesterday.
---
But steel walls are pretty similar on both sides
---
It's no more. The interior of the airport has been redesigned and the vendor bot is no longer with us.
---
Thats wack. With 130% damage redux falling should heal me lol
---
I'll give a shot
---
Not intense if you have a decent shotgun and Enforcer max rank
---
I don't think you understand what nuclear winter means friend
---
I killed like 3.  One because the group I was in attacked him so we were all hostile and he killed me so I got him back. Another a level 200 was harrassing a level 6 with rads and shit so I just hit him with my super sledge. A third time was during sbq another fellow melee guy got a lil too close. Otherwise my friends and I kill eachother for fun and made a boxing ring for it too. Thats pretty much it 🤷🏾‍♂️
---
It's not only the legendaries. How many game-breaking glitches are in Survival?
---
In any other PvP game, having other players instantly regenerate HP after every shot, or a glitch that allows them to be invisible all the time would mean the death of said game if it isn't fixed.
---
But here we are in Fallout 76, where nobody cares.
---
That would certainly be nice. I like to have the max of lockpicking and hacking just in case my friends don't or if I play alone.
---
I know with my build I have a 45% to avoid all damage. Think that maybe what's happening?
---
Which is why I think they make it so that there’s no way you can do that.
---
Just curious - who runs out of steel?
---
What I'm saying is a buildable object to build in the camp. I dont wanna go somewhere to drop items. Put something in camp for it and players can check your trash at the same time they check your vendors. It's better, than dropping shit in random boxes around that maybe no one will find and possibly slightly happy for a suprise of 4 .45 cal rounds and 10 gunpowder. Trash doesnt save. "Dumps your trash everytime you leave the server." Doesn't leave excess data for the server for long periods of time. Exactly what the dumpster should be for.
---
People have been sleeping on my AAE Pipe Bolt Action for so long.  Same base damage as the hunting rifle with double the perk bonuses.  It just sits in my vending machine waiting for the right person.
---
With egg head there's still a display of &lt;1 on the status effects with class freak
---
1. Anything automatic ofc, assuming you're using Lck/Tormentor.
---
2. Good question I don’t know for sure - but I want to say no.
---
3. Increase? No. Have it’s own chance to trigger stagger? I want to say yes but can’t confirm atm.
---
4. Use the building tools at the workshop to your advantage. Make them work for it or distract them long enough to fall into your trap. Don’t underestimate grenades and mines.
---
Rapid firing weapons that can stagger will take them down the quickest as you may well have already figured out. Additionally, crits from vats are both guaranteed to hit and also bypass DR (don’t confuse DR with legendary effects which can still mitigate any direct damage - haven’t tested all non-direct damage there might be something useful there). A lot of pvpers know this and attempt to remain un-vats-able for that reason. Curses to that stupid chameleon bug. Bank that crit for the critical moment (for example, when a stealth boy goes on cool down and the moment before they reactivate another). And then there’s the most obvious solution: fight fire with fire and get some of that gear.
---
Hopefully someone with more experience can chime in about any other strategies.
---
And while riding a SBQ
---
and that's why it doesn't work that way
---
Unfortunately I've been trying that. Instead I'm getting "this vendor current doesn't have enough caps"
---
I would love to have the ammo conversion machine from the Pitt. Lore schmore, let's make it happen Bethesda!
---
Just sell stuff you can use and quit whining
---
I'm constantly making ammo so I can sell it
---
People have crappy builds then because I one shot 3 star legendary super mutants with my rifle.
---
Whoa epic bro my bad bro you alpha male oh heck I’m sorry
---
Adding to the PvE stuff, I wish they'd un-nerf my TSE guns. Just make them entirely ineffective for PvP
---
Atom Cats are a significantly smaller faction. They just had to throw in FEV to get super mutants.
---
Free range isn’t so bad with that build, but could you imagine like 2-4 of those guys beating the lights out of you 🙄
---
What the actual fuck. A 🐑 squatch horde??
---
Kinky
---
I feel the CRAFT should have been capitalised in your title. I love this idea, but just spent two minutes thinking... don't we already have these? Lol.
---
All in door locations are not loaded until a player enters them. Its the reason you can increase a Legendaey enemy from 1 to 3 stars if they are in a building ( ie has load screen, meaning you load in, its not loaded all the time), but you cant do it outside of buildings.
---
I could imagine it! And it’s terrifying!
---
DONT SAY HECK ON A CHRISTIAN SUBREDDIT
---
It's how I play in the other FOs and I don't really play MMOs either so it's difficult for me to decide. I want to be the jack of all trades.
---
Can I invite you to my Christian Fallout 76 server as a way to make up for it
---
Take elevator to 3rd floor, then in the room straight opposite there is a uniform spawn on one of the beds. Hit or miss what one it is, or if it is even there (someone could have got there first). 
---
I've been looking for months for the uniforms. Got all the hats but only ever found the weathered or white uniforms. Till yesterday, got the red one. Then got the blue one today, although that was in a different location as that room only had the white. My husband found it but I have no idea where except for one of the rooms on the 3rd floor.
---
I'm not even trying to make money, just wanted to let someone who wants a 3* mutant slaying guitar sword have one rather than me scripping it. Etc
---
I love that place
---
Lot of extra work to monitor text chats for abuse. Not sure it’s worth it.
---
I'm going to say that you reached your daily cap limit...
---
I would love that
---
This would be great , spawning under peoples structures is getting pretty tiring, especially when that means you end up under water.
---
I like the idea of only having the ones at workshops giving people more of a reason to keep and fight for the workshops
---
So you want it to stay on the server after you leave?
---
How much?
---
Still does.
---
Flatwoods monster isn't the only alien, either.
---
I waited 10 minutes then some lvl 57 wanders in and starts the event and proceeds to do nothing.  We spawned a bloatfly and lost in 30 seconds.
---
I feel like the solution is some sort of in-game LFG system.  That away we can get a decent group and actually have a strategy, not just a constant clusterfuck.
---
If you scrap the chassis, the armor gets dumped in your inventory
---
I mean, from Bethesda's perspective, 10 Atoms is what, 10 cents? Given the amount of work you have to do, those challenges are just not worth it. 
---
Meanwhile over in Hearthstone, you can easily get 100 gold each day from simple daily quests and playing the game, which comes out to about a dollar in value.
---
I'm not saying Bethesda should go crazy with the Atoms, but god damn, they could at least *try* to make challenges either much simpler and keep the rewards the same OR keep the current challenge level but vastly increase the rewards.
---
Something's gotta give.
---
Hey I appreciate the detailed response. Pretty sure tank killer staggers and tormenter gives a chance for cripple, but since people can run adamantium I’m not gonna invest points into that. Also I thought crits bypass legit everything? Who knows lol. Pvp in this game is very un-fleshed out and there’s a lot of mechanics that don’t have any information online. Banking that crit is a great tip tho! 
---
I’m especially interested in the explosive aspect, as I’ve staggered myself before when I shot an explosive too close to myself. Seems like no one really knows and it would be difficult to test. Oh well
---
I have never seen this happen before today. My game crashed before I could get there to get gameplay too😭
---
Yeah, they drop some awesome loot too lol. Bunch of scrip from that stuff.
---
What rifle &amp; what legendary effects? Also there’s a big difference between automatic &amp; semi-auto rifles in this game
---
That's just silly. We all "win" if the queen does, what avantage does that give **over me**? In reality, if we win, we all win.. no advantage over me, just a simple benefit that benefits be as well.
---
Besides, that's what improved repair kits are for, you know.. the ones you can't buy and can only get from playing the game.
---
Take your bad logic to a new subreddit kid.
---
I think your right, i've had a serrated cultist dagger for a long time. I just got a legendary cultist dagger yesterday that does less damage than my old one. Was pretty dissapointed.
---
It's hard to value legendaries. With the scrip machine it's based on the stars. But to put a caps value on weapons is tough because something that's valuable to one person is almost useless to another. Ex. My Anti-Armor super sledge is quite valuable to me but to a sniper build or a shotgun build it's not.
---
I'm not saying it's a bad idea. Just tough to implement. I think the scrip machine is a happy medium and if you have a good legendary you want a good chunk of caps for you can hop on reddit and find a buyer.
---
You don't have to check the machine. On your PipBoy underneath Stats there is a Collections tab that lists how many caps, badges, and legendary scrip you have.
---
They never called it an exploit. All you are getting is downvotes, have a nice day.
---
No more battle royals especially fallout. If they do a battle royal I like most of my friends will stop playing. We've already talked about it when we heard they was a possibilty. I personally wouldn't buy another fallout either as I would lose faith in Bethesda and their integrity to the fallout name
---
No, your trash should empty when you leave the server. If someones doesnt check your trash before you leave. Welp to bad, the dump truck came. Helps with massive amount of random dropped items cluttering the servers in a 24 hour period.
---
Go to a frat party and smash sorority thots
---
So you want the items to persist in a separate container other than your stash and not a world container that follows you server to server?
---
Yeah there's a tech lumitation here, plus people coukd attempt to embed malicious code in the photo files that are being uploaded to the server. Cool idea but not feasible from a net tech or security standpoint.
---
Smg as sidearm to lmg, mmg or hmg. Thanks!
---
It’s very sad
---
Bed sheets?
---
Agreed. There’s plenty of PvE stuff to do, and it’s not like they’re changing the whole game to PvP. If you don’t want it, just wait for the next update.
---
I was going to say is this new like today
---
Are you on PS4 by chance?  I'd love to find a group to do this event with
---
This makes no fucking sense dude. 
---
Surely if the improved ones are winning the slightly worse ones are also winning
---
##how the fuck are people not getting this. Imagine this exact same situation in Rust or Similar and you'd all be crying for weeks.
---
That's not how math works unfortunately.  Percentages off just dont add together,  you take one, and then whatever is left the second percentage deducts from that.
---
With all melee? I have noticed a few swings lately make the hit sound and no damage registers(with ghouls too, so I know it isn’t just a block not showing animation).
---
No I don't. If its trash why would I want it to stay it's being discarded for a reason, gives someone an option to take it easily if they want to. You can make it permanent. You arent allowed to take it out after you put trash in. (Cant be used as an extra storage space)
---
Tbh u sound. More butthurt than me
---
Stimpack Diffuser plans, Formula B plans, and Arktos Back plans.  Plus some other stuff I'm not interested in
---
I understand it's multiplicative, not additive now. Waste of 2 perk points lol.
---
Maybe try reinstalling the game because it sounds like your have corrupted files. Also there's a ton of pvp who enjoy pvp just because happen to not doesn't make your statement any where near being accurate.
---
Wish I could say I was even close to my limit,  I had sold 150 caps worth only. Unless player vending selling comes in to play ?  But that would work out at 500ish caps alone.
---
im not the original comment, but i find the machine more reliable, the amount of times collection tab has shown "0" across the board is to damn high
---
&gt; Trying to meet people and trade as a noobie and everyone just wants to kill me.
---
This question is weird.
---
PvP in adventure mode is voluntary,  Nobody can force you.
---
If somebody shoots you just use the puke emote.
---
So the same thing as a paper bag just a trash can?
---
Fuck man i hope they dont pull some Battle Royal bullshit on us.  There are games that do it better.  On top of that I hate BR games anyways.  Give me more PvEvP type of stuff or just good'ol PvE.  I want more quests but make them longer and more meaningful.  Instead of 20 fluff quests give me 5-10 long thought out quests please.
---
Haha, yeah. I like your version better though 😊
---
Did you check your inventory? It goes in your inventory it you don't enter back in after 60 seconds
---
It's not in your inventory as power chassis? Also you can make your own at level 25 excavator quest
---
Incorrect, look into how the creation kit and papyrus work for Skyrim modding. Fallout 4's engine, the platform this game runs on, is the same engine as skyrim, modified to fit fallout gameplay.
---
What at you are seeing is the inventory arbitrarily re-ordering itself, same way it does in fallout 4 and skyrim. A long-standing bug that has never been fixed.
---
No player vending should not affect your npc cap. If I'm not mistaken npc cap is 1500 daily.
---
Use fall damage reduction and bird bones
---
Or better yet, fall from high places in power armor
---
I really think they want to make 3* really rare. But if not always, at least make the queen drop 3* always. Because wow, all that and a 1* wood arm. Lol
---
I'm on PS4 I've got it listed for 8k.  Max Lvl 2\*
---
Baby's first mmo
---
My problem with this post is that it's impossible.  In adventure mode, if you haven't taken a public workshop, nobody can hurt you in PvP.
---
Whoa, I’m a 55 and just hooked someone up. What did they give you? I sincerely hope you enjoy it!
---
Well I mean the terminals state that the project is far enough underground that surface conditions don’t factor.
---
No, I'd be over-encumbered by it. But it hasn't shown up anywhere. 😭
---
I believe you can get a set of raider power armor in the raider part of Camden Park, i can't remember if it's a full set tho. :/
---
Yes it does. 
---
You are still going to take damage from weapons regardless of how high your resistance is, it just takes longer the more resistance you have. Even if it seems like it doesn't take long, it takes a whole lot less time the lower the resistance.
---
I couldn't say exactly how long time difference is, but I was needing to get killed today to fix the bones sticking out glitch. My damage resistance sits around 455 and energy around 550 (or something like that). Decided to let a supermutant shoot me to death and wondered why it was taking so long. Forgot to take armour off. So I took all that off and it was noticeable how much quicker I was getting killed.
---
So yes, it does make a difference.
---
The horde event has been a glitch since before sheepsquatch was even added. No one has had any proof of this event being what it is named.
---
Last time I walked through after the redesign the vender was laying in a pile next to their old post. It was a tragic end to the last responder stationed at the airport
---
i use cryo's in events, slowing enemys down can be amazing
---
Exactly but placeable in camp. Not moving. You have to go to the can and throw it in or litter if you'd like but I'm ocd. And I think its dumb that if I don't want to litter my camp I have to go somewhere to drop or transfer.
---
Yep. You need Animal Friend/Wasteland Whisperer (optimally rank 3 of both) and a animal/creature spawned from a random encounter that is completely alone. If those criteria are met, you can aim your weapon at the animal/creature and a "Tame" button prompt will appear next to the "Pacify" one. Taming a animal/creature will mark it as being owned by you and it will try to travel to your camp and stay there, acting as a guard. If you want to tame something, server hop a "Scene" type random encounter spot until you get one that is just a lone animal/creature and nothing else, tame it, and then pray that it actually makes it to your camp instead of dying on the way or just straight up never showing up.
---
There's actually a rather large variety of animals/creatures you can tame. IMO, Deathclaws are the coolest, but a Mirelurk King is the best if you want something that can actually fight effectively. Tameable Deathclaws can only be level 21 and tend to get rolled by the level 50+ enemies that will spawn to attack your camp. A Mirelurk King can be level 30+, do a lot of damage, have a ranged attack, and is surprisingly durable.
---
^balloon deflating^
---
One must consider the fact that we can force a 3* drop by simply spending scrip at the purveyor. Nobody wants to play a game in which everyone has the best items from simply playing for a month or two.
---
I agree with these except the one shot. If your doing an event and people are helping you and you one shot the boss that's just a d-bag move. There are like 2 unspoken "rules", don't keep trying to pvp with those who don't want to and don't one shot the boss. It's really not that hard.
---
I'm sorry. I've went to multiple and it's always been a mess of some other event happening or supermutant horde.
---
Locations, Recipe's, Plans, consumption, production... so many challenges are bugged.
---
I have around 2k worth of atoms I have completed but won't register.
---
100% agree with you but its likely too late, a lot of the stuff for it is already made. Honestly have no idea whats with this fascination with pvp from Bethesda.
---
Legendary scrapping is pretty spot on. Limited to 150 a day is really good. The only thing I'd like to see changed is being able to get legendary mods specific for primary, secondary, tertiary effects. But specific mods would cost 1000 scrip. So it'd take a whole week just to get one. That seems reasonable. They can make them nontradeable. Then you can get your "dream legendary"
---
This one worked for me finally, although several others did not.  Thanks!
---
Not even a /s can save you from downvotes in this sub.
---
The only weapons I have that are 3 star tho that are worth while and that I actually got from a 3 star are probably like 4. The rest I’ve bought from other players. There’s a million options out there for a 3 star to drop, I mean I’ve gotten plenty 3 star life regenerating left legs I’ve sold cause I’ve got no interest lol.
---
A must have for any heavy weapons buil is Bear arms. 90% reduced weight for all heavy weapons at rank 3. I carry probably 10+ heavy weapons on me at all time because they all weigh less than 2 pounds. Gives you options.
---
Technically no, but, if you have a foundation either side of a wall, *sometimes* you can place two brick walls back to back
---
King!
---
Mine was due to lag and one extra hit of the key board.
---
The shop needs 2 things
---
A more detailed view of the item. And on that second screen, the purchase option
---
it actually stops the robots from spawning.
---
Or the ever popular 1 star mutants wood left arm. Ugh favorite lol
---
Uninstall all data and start again
---
🤷
---
I mean I hear lots of sobs and whining from you so what do you expect.  You're the one crying about the event,  not me.
---
Huge download but heck it worked for me
---
Sweet!
---
And 50 atom points
---
Lost all my precious pics thou
---
They could drop the 3* wood leg and you he stoked about it, then relog and it's a 1* 😂
---
Last tip:   I finally finished this damn challenge.   There is a fissure site alllll the way at the bottom of the ash heap,look it up on a map if you havent found it yet, you'll get the scorch beast one if you kill it and there is a static deathclaw there as well that counts
---
Is.
---
There is no "winning" condition in this game, unless you play survival, this is a co-op game. We all benefit from anything useful, that's it. Your argument sucks.
---
Even in survival your argument doesn't make sense, because there is no "winning" condition, and repairing your weapon isn't going to help you "win".
---
This isn't rust or that other game, you can't pay to "win" in a game where there's nothing to win. What do you win? The answer is.. you don't.
---
It's an object of convenience that is made completely obsolete by the advanced ones you can only earn by playing.
---
You're ability to argue am argument is really really bad.
---
Yeah. It's tough for me to not sound a little hypocritical when all the context is gone.
---
I’d be so pumped to get anything 3 star lol.
---
What ammo sells that well? And are you not terminally limited by lead or other items instead of steel?
---
Okay this is a way better idea. I’m just tired of getting legendaries I have no use for!
---
🤓 I am the master of farming these outfits.
---
There are lots of kind souls on this Reddit who would replace this for you.  What platform are you playing on?
---
It's likely to be a max % that can take effect at any given time.
---
No I'm have tons of lead, I make tons of 556
---
They could however just include the original weight when you inspect an item. No extra buttons, just a useful stat.
---
My solution would be to keep the three star drop chance the same for regular enemies, but have it be guaranteed for the end-game bosses (SBQ, Imposter Sheepsquatch, and the Arktos Alpha). That way people would actually be encouraged to spawn them and will always at least get some reward for the resources they dump into beating them instead of getting worthless garbage like a 1\* wood piece or stuff they already have.
---
Exactly! XD
---
Most of the scrip legends I get from murmgh I post on the sub for trades. If nobody bites, I scrap em 😂
---
Unfortunately XBOX.  But I’d post something on this sub asking for ORGANIZED groups to play with.  It’s such a mess without it.
---
Good tip. Will keep in mind
---
Fair enuff, don't pvp personally. So my advice was for pve.

This may come as news but the entire f/o76 community is not on Reddit and may not have any idea what things are worth...nor do they see your psa...don't see what you want, move along please. No need to clutter up our reddit feeds with pointless whining.
---
Personally I haven't really played the game for about 2 weeks, one stopped coming back to game since the dailies were so bad and came back for event and went straight there but crashed 26+ times from trying to enter via elevator or fast traveling to event and just shut game off after a few wasted hours. Really hope the mini dlc is good coming up since they releasing battle royal as next major dlc and I personally hate pvp.
---
Missed connections :)
---
Sorry Werewolves aren't released yet so you can't do that daily challenge.
---
You’re not my dad.
---
You can. Just point your gun down range n shoot. Not too difficult.
---
Live and learn. I don’t have a 556 user and am usually dumping all my spare 556. I did spin up a 4th character going Commando and am experiencing a bit of a ammo drought, so interesting to see other perspectives. 
---
But I also have a Flamer boy, and honestly I’m not sure any ammo is as frustrating to make / keep as fuel.
---
Then show me the zetans in 76 as a battle-able enemy
---
Oh ....few....that's a relief. I was scared for a second that I would have to take you out on a family fun SBQ run and tell you to clean up your camp.
---
Unfortunately you can't trade or drop the broken camera for anyone else to pick up.  You've got to start it from the tourist, once you do you'll start seeing broken cameras everywhere.  I've got another 9 extras (Xbox) in case, I guess, I accidentally lose mine?  Or if I want to have different lens attachments?
---
Yeah I had microphone on and waited at the loot as well so he could find it. And this guy just waved at me when he respawned. I think he was actually quite happy with getting the bounty removed as well now that I think of it. 
---
But he was only lvl 15-20, so I wanted to show him good community anyways you know :D
---
I use a bolt action pipe rifle which benefits from both the pistal and rifle perks as well nerd rage that gives me a damage bonus at low health which I always have due to rads. I'm also a stealth build so I do 2.5x damage if I'm hidden. My bolt action pipe rifles damage is almost 500 and also has explosive shot.
---
if I tell somebody their prices are too high its bc I want to haggle. it's pretty realistic and will sometimes get you the thing you want at a lower price
---
Oh I use to love the lvl up one then they removed the Monster Mash event starting when a player enters the High School.
---
I've recieved 2x 1* troubleshooter rolling pins in the past 5 times I've killed the queen. 
---
Its really frustrating.
---
I stop with telling people to stop telling people to stop telling people how to stop telling people who are stopping people to stop...now.
---
Cool where do the stats show up?
---
I now finally see what the Mathyr perk is used for :P
---
My last camp was actually on the bridge at harpers with stairs down to resources below. Good spot, but busy. Was less of a good thing before vending and when your base could be destroyed.
---
They one shot level 300 also. There is no magical veil of defense granted at any certain level.

Bethesda "Bad news the daily requiring skanky outfit is impossible due to not being released yet, don't worry though you can buy those atoms from the atomic shop instead for real money".
---
No prices are wrong 
---
Says the person charging 3K for a one star legendary and 10 caps each for water
---
Lol. I've been to your camp. I saw the arrow and then fell into the "hole."
---
And I used to live there. Had my camp in that spot for 30 levels or so. And I fell in about 10 times.
---
You are part of the silent majority
---
so we need to equip good with salt rank 1 ? do it stack ?
---
Well that sucks. I found one a long time ago before the backpack quest was a thing. I either sold it or scrapped it. Ever since then I haven't found anything and I've been looking all weekend.
---
Damn, I just started a new punching sniper character too! Gonna keep an eye out for pipe revolvers and invest in pistol as well as rifle
---
Weenies, oh ouch man! Rule 4 is keep it civil!
---
Lol what's ur gt makes me wanna come take ur workshops
---
They just gotta give some cool mechanical types power armour anywhere, and an Atom Cats like group/chapter would start anywhere.
---
I doubt Bethesda would do that. It’s just not a stable system for that, nor does the lore back it up. I feel like ZAX might play a part of the nuclear summer update or some big PVE area.
---
Hell, we should be able to bulk ALL materials IMO. Why can't we bulk ballistic fiber or circuits but we CAN bulk lead? And why does bulking some things not really reduce weight? Isn't that the POINT? We need to be able to break down ammo and to bulk gunpowder as well. Gunpowder shouldn't be in our Misc. menu, it should be in our junk menu. Hopefully the next few patches will be quality of life and bug-fix heavy. We really need it.
---
A simple and cheap solution to event rewards requiring you to tag enemies.
---
Yep. I actually went off the rails today (unintentionally) being lazy one shotting at Whitesprings and PVPd a player and he killed me.  Sought revenge and killed me again. Then I realized I was the idiot for blasting everyone in sight.  Poor me.  But I’m not going to write a fucking post about it.
---
Yes... just yes
---
It's not by 2, used to be but now the extra projectile does just 20-25% damage I think
---
Just go to thenmothman museum and server hop until the tourist is there it's pretty common tbh
---
Yeah good question. 
---
I think it’s already added. 
---
But the multiplier has been needed to 1.25x damage I believe. So you won’t see much change. But that little bit is better than nothing for sure!
---
Well there are other kinds of broken cameras outside of the one you need to repair and use.  The only one you can use to repair and start the tourist quest is on the body of the tourist, which appears at different tourist destinations around the world (Wavy Willards, Civil war fort/cemetary, etc).  Any camera you've found besides those aren't usable, you can just break those down into components.
---
RNG is a bastard, I'd recommend server hopping on Wavy Willards.  Head towards the front gate, you should see the tourist's body slumped against a car in the parking lot.  If you don't see anyone by the time you hit the front  gate, disconnect and join another server.  Rinse, repeat, until you get the body to appear.
---
This is just my experience, but with 15 Endurance and 3 points in Vaccinated, I sometimes get swarmed by diseased ghouls and only if they wail on me a lot do I get diseased.  The diseased Scorch Beast barely gives me the blight anymore.
---
I set up a vending machine where everything costs 0 Caps and put "FREEBIES" in big neon letters above it.  I stock it mostly with ammo and common plans I inevitably pick up in my travels that I have no use for myself.
---
Beside that, I put a table where I put the "poop bag" of stuff that's leaving.
---
Seriously I'm sad how unfallout 3 the whole series has gotten. Fo3 is the best one hands down
---
Thanks for the help. Damn just wasted all my savings on a two shot combat rifle!!
---
But you're literally doing the same thing right now....
---
All right, thanks. I will try that.
---
Oh ok, that’s strange..
---
Reddit:  where great writeups come from people with horrible names.
---
DiarrheaBlaster is right.  As a separate game mode it would be fun.  Might provide much needed data for balance in other modes.  And an arena where people fight to the death for amusement fits in perfectly with the post apocalyptic theme.
---
I just hope we can watch in game and bet caps on who wins.
---
Damn are you from Nestlé? lmao
---
Try to find another armor with 50% fall damage reduction. 2 pieces will give you immune to fall damage, they additive with each other. Perk is useless.
---
It's been extremely good the last week or two.  Even swapping servers, which used to invariably cause some kind of crash down the road, seems to work fine.
---
I ran around the parking lot of whitesprings while my buddy killed the ghouls chasing me. We both found 10 legendaries on the same one ghoul
---
 Neither of us died either.
---
Please stop.
---
I have it, id just rather be able to use an,extra WWR piece :(
---
I will take you on crazy adventure to find u new 1 ma friend. 
---
But first. Lemme have some sleep XD
---
Same thing happened to me got a cool pic with it and then most of my pics got deleted for some reason. Cool photo though!
---
Nevermind. It was the fallout 4 disc that was causing it.... For some reason. I removed it from the disc drive and it solved the problem.
---
I had not only a double squatch at Free Range... but a nearby random event spawned a third Sheepsquatch... 
---
It was just the intensest thing ever and I won without dying! Felt bad for the 4 guys under lvl 80 with me though...
---
I mean, it's easy enough for people to ignore trolling... just saying
---
Cool
---
Oh god if I came across a radium Rifle suppressor or hardened receiver mod that would be godly. They would be so expensive though. I would love this!! Just make it cost slightly more materials to make the sellable mod compared to crafting the mod straight onto your weapon.
---
Eeeh you can't shit in a bag and leave it on the ground ! Ewwww &gt;:(
---
Love Fo3 so much still have to play NV because I came late to the party when I found 3 laying in a GameStop sad and alone and saved it. Now I’m an addict. Living sad and alone with my wife and kids and dogs. Unable to stop loving everything fallout even if its sub par.
---
I see this mostly the same way as you.  It's just going to be a silly add-on that I can take or leave.  My only gripe is that I assume that development time is a zero-sum game, and the time spent doing things like battle royale could have been spent working on new quests and traditional content.  But I think Wild Appalachia balanced it pretty well.  Survival Mode didn't detract.  We just don't know what's in store for Nuclear Winter besides the Vault Raids and Nuclear Winter itself.
---
Fair enough, but it’s more about just giving advice rather than whining. Why should I purchase 10 stimpaks for 1000 from person A when person B sells 10 stimpaks for 500. Simple retail business strategies. You want to sell your items? Don’t sell them from more than they are worth. And I don’t know how people wouldn’t know how much an item is worth, there’s various vendors around the map to give you some price points for certain items. 
---
Sorry my “whining” troubled you so much. And yes, I realize most of the Fo76 community is not on Reddit, so why not you link me to another Fo76 community with over 185k followers?
---
Sometimes the collections tab doesnt update it, the machine shows the correct amount you actually have
---
Agree with everything you have said. Love it when people who dont agree with you immediately get nasty.  You can disagree and not be a fucking douche.
---
I can't live on the internet without someone or three pointing out the little bit of hypocracy in my posts everyday. I am never going to win the internet's at this pace.
---
10?! Gamer!!
---
That doesn't stop players from being able to spend caps, they don't need power to work. The ability to lock them out is sensible.
---
Having a power switch (like I do) gives players the ability to turn off the power, having to make an elaborate wiring to keep players from accessing the switch isn't always feasible. Neither is having to manually disconnect the power.
---
I had great luck at Bolton Green.  The fountain right up front, one server hop.
---
I think that's easier than searching around the Waterpark from what others have said.
---
Excellent post and a perspective that definitely sees further than tip of own nose, I hope this will end up just as you described.
---
I go by what is says .. to me it looks like it tallied the total
---
Anytime m8!
---
Would be nice if you could also collect the small branches and scraps of junk laying around other folks camps and deposit them in a trash can like bin like you suggested for a small bit of exp. This would of course only give the player receiving the junk, wood and steel, but I believe it would more importantly promote visiting one anothers camps.
---
You mean throw?
---
The shooting range south of the Operation Tidy quest spot always has rad roaches, so I do that quest first then head over and get the meat. Then  fast travel to start and finish the quest at the same time.
---
I havent looked into it much, what makes you think nuclear winter is a battle royal? Is there any evidence suggesting it is?
---
Yup me too, I hardly any crashes at all on PS4. The frame rate could be a bit better but that’s all.
---
Somerset special and lots of schematics including miner mole gauntlet(?). I certainly have been! Its been a real turnaround for the game and im happy to see more people enjoying it.
---
A Behemoth King would make sense if you nuked WestTek. That’d be so fucking cool.
---
But how hard would it be to only allow images that come straight from the game itself? That would mitigate the whole swastika and porn and copyright thing, wouldn’t it?
---
Thank you for clarifying this.  I had the same question about Sentinel and Cavalier.
---
Not available yet. According to dataminers it's coded to unlock from completing a special weekly challenge. 
---
To avoid disappointment, the Beer Keg is just a Punch Bowl with a different model (you can mark alcoholic beverage items in your stash to put into it and other players visiting your camp can consume them when they interact with it. The functionality of the Punch Bowl got removed with patch 9 so they could sort out some issues with it).
---
You must be blessed by the RNG because that's pretty good for sbq fight.
---
Killing players / killing the boss before anyone else gets a chance / destroying other players bases / beating my friends to achievements ect 
---
These are all things I'd class as winning
---
Yeah I find shotgun shells, 5mm, and fusion cores will usually sell to some one. Though lately that business has been slow.
---
The Mire
---
Lol. Post got removed.
---
Oh I member.. yea I remember when we were told 10x the detail.. mmm I member when they said hrs of content.. I remember
---
I'll second this. It's a form of gate keeping IMO.
---
I’m not alone
---
I’ve only ever done it with a team that did it right every time. Frankly, I have no clue.
---
Just server hop or play in Pacifist. Are you playing in Survival?
---
I've noticed the melee bugs when I use one of my slow weapons, but I never have problems with my super fast power fist. Except for the vats thing with bugs, I can't use vats with melee.
---
I was agreeing with you.
---
Soooo... can I get some of that salt? I need it for one of the recipes I learned recently that gives plus +3 speed of arrival for the waaaambulance.
---
They contested your workshop wrong?
---
I am playing adventure with pacifist mode on.
---
Then I lose my workshops
---
Same
---
In the ash heap
---
No sacrifice,  no victory! Just server hop.
---
Would have loved scrap anything if it ever worked for me haha
---
Or give them a more specific loot pool that includes 2 or 3 stars, but leaves out 1 star, rolling pins, drills, and wood armor.
---
But all my vending is filled with valuable junk so that's excess space taken up by trash
---
Exactly
---
That would be cool.
---
Lvl 209, I am sitting on 76 currently. I sometimes pick cards to share to help out my teammates, or new cards to try with my build. Also have a few cards at different ranks to switch out as needed. But otherwise... they sit there banked. 😂
---
You all realise that the stairs are easily noticeable and don't catch people by surprise right? I have caution signs outside, I welcome people to use my workshop stations without locking them in, all they have to do is get up the staircase I made to originally kill off stray mole rats &amp; feral dogs.
---
Still grinding it?
---
The only explanation is if you dropped it instead of picking it up
---
Much appreciated, just took 5 pictures dead center of a Storm, none of them counted.
---
PVE pls
---
You're obviously not mechanically inclined enough to take apart those cars properly. You're going to have to use that 10mm pistol and a knife to build your fusion generator, sorry
---
I had the same problem with campfire tales everyone was concered about the enemies and didnt pay attention to the fire
---
What? There is already a mute player. Ez pz no extra work needed.
---
I suspect its how to sell to consoles as a worthy update.
---
And man i would love some area text. Wanted to help a guy get the food machine running at a workshop... There was just no way without going to root thru my desk for a mic. Frustrating. Not a big fan of mic only games
---
Point me to a legit source (not youtuber click bait bullshit) saying that they wouldn't add a battle royale mode.
---
Also, so what if they add it. Imagine spawning with no gear on a random part of the map and having to scavenge for supplies and weapons while a deadly rad storm closes in. I wouldn't play it all the time, but it honestly sounds fun as fuck.
---
Hey fam- I’ve been looking for more people to socialize with. I have no problem starting fresh with you. If you wanna use power armor I’ll support you. I wanna try melee anyway. So hit me up on PC if you wanna put some work in Appalachia. IGN: iGhostfire92
---
And 1 bulk screws.
---
Probably works on the same multiplicative formula that most other RPG type games work on. Which basically means you gain a huge amount of damage resist going from naked to having a decent amount of armor, but stacking more armor from there becomes less effective and less noticeable.
---
Kill me
---
PVE please.
---
PVP sucks in Fallout 76.
---
Open one of the vault for this event!
---
I've got my vending machines and a roll up door running off of a switch only I can access by replacing a wall. This let's me take them off the map AND close them behind a inaccessible door if I'm at or near my cap limit
---
Nobody ever asked for pvp, all anyone ever wanted was 'Fallout with friends'.
---
Moment of silence for our fallen brethren 😢
---
I will almost always buy shotgun shells at 1 cap. Depending on my ammo and caps situation I might buy them at 2 caps. If I'm desperate I might even buy at 3.
---
Plastic is time consuming to farm and hard to get the amount needed for serious crafting in general exploration, unlike gunpowder, steel, or lead. Caps are usually easier to get.
---
PC
---
Two armors with 50% fall damage completely negative fall damage however, so look for a second one of those.
---
This I can confirm
---
None of those are possible in adventure mode except for the second, "killing the boss before anyone else" isn't winning.. actually none of those are, they all sound more like "being an asshole".
---
Maybe the problem is you and how you play the game. I'm sure 99% of the player base wouldn't consider any of those winning, just assholes.
---
I do wish there was a better way to see how much caps items are going for on average. I never know what to price things at and my stash is getting full from sitting on items
---
Hi! That's me! I start high and go lower as time goes on. As the vending economy is taking shape, I really have no idea how much something should go for. So, I shoot high and accept low when it gets there. So far, I have sold 1 thing and that was the hallucinogen gas canister grenades for 25 a piece. No one has touched my 6k 1 star legendary, so I dropped it to 3k. Going to be dropping them again here soon. 
---
Prices are all over the place, but it is becoming more and more apparent that I am pricing things too high. Which is good. This means the economy is not royally screwed and inflated like so many other games (hence the high pricing to start). I saw posts with people saying they are sitting at max caps and don't know how to spend, so I figured everyone was flushed with caps.
---
I have a second one, was trying to switch it out for an extra WWR piece :(
---
If it’s heavy story content I’ll probably redownload to run it with friends. If it’s BR, in a franchise that shouldn’t be near that mode, I’ll probably drop the game indefinitely. They just haven’t been making good decisions at all
---
I'm level 100 and just accruing screws I have no idea what's going on lol
---
Ps4 sir.
---
Waaaaah!! My virtual world doesn't comport to reality. 
---
Think of them as perks. Seriously, how many levels did you have to grind to get +50 carry weight? Did those perks carry over to your other characters? 
---
And what game are you playing? It's all doing stuff for robots/AI/holotapes.
---
Must’ve been leftovers from a hoard event
---
Berry mentats aren’t exactly a counter. They usually just VATS you by the time you see the pink cloud
---
:c
---
I think you just have to be inside a storm not a rad storm cause im not in a rad storm, its just raining and i took a picture of 2 supermutants and i just completed the challenge
---
It would be over before you join them.
---
Hear me out: 50 players queue up on a server. Everyone spawns naked (other than their chosen cosmetic outfits), no guns, no aid, etc, at random points on the map. You have to gather whatever you can while killing other players and outrunning the deadly rad storm that's slowly consuming the map. Winner gets a 3 star legendary, 2nd place gets a 2 star, 3rd place gets a 1 star. 
---
Am I the only one that thinks that sounds fucking awesome?
---
Dude Fortnite is bad, first of all, because of asinine developers. Secondly, they’re “allowed “ to do whatever they want, but the vast majority of their decisions and designs are awful.
---
They kinda buffed the rate diseases trigger!
---
It just works!
---
Sorry, I’m on Xbox
---
Hey. Tesla rifles are known to do that. Spamming tesla rifles trigger the glitch and once it's triggered, no weapon can do any damage. It's been like that for at least 2 months now.
---
"I wish I could tell you the sisters laid off on Andy but His asshole was beyond repair."
---
Yeah apparently some people drop their armor instead of place it.  Apparently this 'works' and you can enter it, but you run the risk of, well, the OP.
---
Are you on PC?
---
Did you forget what the post is about?! Also Who do you see crying lmao I called u a jabroni and you got butthurt and decided to attack me over a playful insult. Its like calling you a nicompoop its a stupid insult meant to be dumb. No one uses it as a actual insult but yet here we are with you accusing me Of crying when obviously u got butthurt By a dumb insult meant to be dumb and took it literal. So I guess sorry for hurting your feelings? Also your arguing with 2 people thinking they Are the same person just a heads up
---
They could be stacking bobbleheads unless they nerfed that but it depends on the weapon which depends on the perks
---
Or... Pharna farma, I find I get loads from that!
---
“I’ll have you know”
---
The build trying not to get sick every 10 seconds, obviously it didn't work!
---
Radworms made Ghouls deadlier than Deathclaws!
---
Why am I getting downvoted. You people have no sense of humor. Friggin sjw snowflakes. Grow a pair
---
I can't either actually. I talk to him and he just spouts his rotating idle dialogue. Maybe because I'm still a tadpole?
---
Without wearing any "gas mask".
---
This! It's hard for people to trust you to mod their gear for them unless they're already a friend you run with!
---
There is nuance here.
---
I've been in situations where I've basically soloed an event and some twat has just been watching and waiting for the boss.  Fuck that person.  I'll one shot it if I can and they can bitch about me not being fair.  Want me to be fair, don't sit around while I take down three waves of ghouls then try to jump in last second.
---
I've been in situations where we all fight and I miss hitting the boss by a hair.  We all fight off waves, work together, and I just happen to miss the opportunity.  Yeah, it sucks, but shit happens.
---
I've been in situations like the first one, but the twat who was waiting and not helping ends up one shotting the boss.  That pissed me off a bit, but in that particular circumstance he ended up getting into pvp with another person who actually helped during the event and got obliterated.  It was nice catharsis.
---
So, I can agree that you shouldn't one shot the boss, but I'm not going to wait around in the heat of battle, especially if some twat is leeching off my (and possibly others') hard work.
---
Besides, it's not like you'll never be able to do the event again or kill the boss at some point.  Saying things like ," I could've gotten a god tier roll of xx armor piece I want," is bullshit.  You could have gotten a one star wood left arm just as easily.  Stop whining.  Hell, we have the legendary vendor now as well, so even a useless legendary can count toward getting something better from her.
---
Ah too bad.  I'm on Xbox and someone else on the same platform offered to give me my missing pieces.  Well, edit the OP to include your platform, and maybe you'll get lucky and someone else on PS4 will see this and offer to hook you up!  
---
Alternative is find a location for a raider power armor spawn and server hop.  Not sure if there is one in the forest or Ash Heap area, but as those are lower levels the loot that spawns in them should also be lower?  Personally I've been server hopping the Cliffwatch camp near Top of the World but it seems split between giving me lvl 45 pieces and lvl 15.
---
Pro tip for server hopping: leave the frame.  Only pick up the pieces you need, set your CAMP somewhere nearby.  Leave the world, join the game again to get a new world, and check the power armor container for pieces you don't have.  Rinse, repeat until you have all the pieces, then grab the frame if you need it.
---
And that's why it would be great for those of us who craft it and gives you the mod. I feel limited when I can't help out others all the way.
---
I need serum recipes so I can sell serums at low enough prices. That way everyone can be jumping high and having healing abilities.
---
The issue is, buildings spawn in long after the player renders, even pre built structures!
---
They have the code for both taking screenshots and texture converting. Implementing these is another case. Anyways, these things should be optional if users have internet / bandwidth caps else no news and email for a month (which is not necessarily a bad thing)
---
Indeed but I do get random players who hand me stuff at times to craft. I can understand where you are coming from with this view point.
---
No we don't have it because if we did then I would have read it everywhere on Reddit in the search menu.
---
Maybe I need give more flair with each word next time.
---
If anyone gets this one done, I wouldn't mind seeing it.. for reasons.
---
" Take a picture of a blue moon while a werewolf is fisting the scorchbeast queen in a nuke zone at 3am "
---
&gt;Name some games where it takes 20 bullets to kill an enemy. I’ll wait🤡 (good games, popular btw not some dogshit indie game we don’t know)
---
Most enemies in Division 2 take a at least half to a full clip unless you have a slow firing, high powered sniper rifle, and those enemies are supposedly regular humans. Is it really that hard to believe that some fantastical creature would have better inherent damage resistance than a human?
---
Try the whitespring vendor.
---
Here here! It's frustrating as hell getting a 4th lockpick card in two different packs.
---
That’s true
---
Pc player here but cant you connect your ps4 to modem? I cant imagine playing online games with wifi honestly but it has been years since i owned a console.
---
Sparta
---
Lvl 215 and never set foot in survival mode.  I've killed a dozen or so players that attacked my base, but never even engaged in PvP when in a workshop (aside from being sneak attack one shotted while doing a PvE defense).  They can have it if they want it.
---
Hope Fallout 5 has COOP because 76 ruined playing alone for me.
---
I don't u needed that mod to scrap cars
---
We really really need this.
---
Hardly anyone uses the mic in Australian servers, and there's hardly any Discord servers for Aussies for Fallout 76 down here.
---
And I've played a lot too.
---
Every time I see somebody running a blooded build I assume they're going to fuck me over on any given event. I've... I've been hurt before.
---
Here's a pro tip - if you strip the frame and leave it, it won't respawn another. But, if you take the 15 seconds to move the frame and drop it away from the spawn point before stripping it another one will respawn in time. This helps everyone on the server, or hopping, looking for parts.
---
No, it was 16x the detail and 4x the size if fallout 4. And if I remember correctly it had all new texture, graphics and lighting technology. I also remember how to speak English properly, would you like me to teach you?
---
Any link to them ?
---
Yes. In fact there is a post ranting on how it clips hats of you're wondering that too. 
---
At least the frequency of this question died down. Now it's a competition between "is 76 good now?" And "perk card load outs"
---
I'm waiting for massive organized groups to pop up who agree at what certain prices should be, and anyone charging less and wrecking their perceived market will have a hit put on them.
---
I reckon that we can judge how close to the mark you are by the responses from Bethesda after the holiday weekend. No response might mean that indeed they were planning such a mode. It would be incredible lame though. The market is supersaturated with such games.
---
The only people that would rather type than just talk are insecure about they're voice
---
Honestly if duping hadnt happed they would be waaaayyyy more. Imagine the value if instead of at least a few thousand BE handmades there were maybe 5? Im willing to bet they would be 200k+. Not saying duping is a good thing bcs it really isnt, and i got fucked over pretty hard by it (collected 125k worth of rare weapons, that are now worth 10k at best) but it does drive prices down.
---
If you play the game enough and trade or visit other vendors it’s not a big deal to set a reasonable price for items.
---
So when you say it clips hats, say, the Civil War Top Hat, you can see it bleed through said hat?
---
Bethesda is afraid of bad words I think based on previous events that have occurred within 76, although it's funny they thought people wouldn't SPEAK bad words into the game instead lmao. Nah, but since they apparently don't give a rat's ass about the PC community so to speak they decided it was better to just make everybody use VC because anti-social gamers NEED TO SPEAK UP am I right? Especially if you only get to play at weird hours because of your job, yuup a basic text-chat would have been great. Strange priorities at BETHESDERP.
---
&gt;The public opinion on the game just might completely collapse.
---
Who the fuck cares? People have been (often) unfairly shitting on this game since day 1, and yet tens or hundreds of thousands of people are still playing. No mentally functional human over the age of 12 should give a fuck what some douchebag "YouTube personality" has to say about the game, or what the salty bitches in /r/fallout say about it.
---
If you envoy it, keep playing. If not, go play one of the other thousands of games released every year.
---
Yes, you can wear hats with it, and no it doesn’t give any protection to environmental dangers which is silly. I bought it and that was the first thing I looked at.
---
I just take it upon myself to do the nuts and bolts work of the event, because 75% of the time the other participants get tunnel vision when they see a starred enemy.
---
Project Paradise is really difficult, because I can't really do all the work myself while everyone else is spazzing out on the boss, or random robots and not picking up anything to put in the troth.  At best I can get a friendly to rank 1 by myself.
---
Privacy? What are people doing in there? :p
---
Or ignore them and just deal. They expire eventually.
---
I once had a drone drop for me near Charleston.  I was running around the corner to the crate and someone had run up and picked the lock. He became wanted and I blew him away as he tried to run.  I have killed 6 and that’s it because I’ve had some people shot me and I retaliate and the friend shoots me and takes my caps and junk. Now I just leave the server and continue playing.
---
Locking purifiers is necessary
---
On Xbox, even in the early days, I rarely got kicked from servers. Now, when I do get kicked from servers, it’s when my WiFi decides to randomly stop and then keep working, making me curse at the fact that I can only choose from one internet provider in my area
---
If the newest one had a world wide notice I'm sure more people would join.
---
If there is only one person there I don't bother with it because it's a waste of stuff. As repairs and healing items take a hit when there is no one else for the lv 100 boss to attack.
---
Does the red one actually spawn at the Asylum or do you get in from an event like everyone has told me?
---
like if people laughing at my games or making fun of it would change my mind or something..
---
 it's not perfect but it's my shitty game
---
\+1
---
Given the historical nature of the mask, it both makes sense and is disappointing at the same time.
---
Wait this is still not in?? The heckers
---
We get it. You are too barbaric to enjoy things other than killing
---
The people you dealt with suck. That's why i said people who actively help. The fact that you can do the event again isn't the point. If your putting in just as much effort as everyone else you should get the same rewards as they do. It's not much to wait a few seconds to make sure those who help you get a piece. That being said if the boss is working you over and you have no choice but to kill it before it kills you then it is what it is. It's not whining if you put out just as much effort and supplies as the next guy and he one shots the boss esp when he doesn't need to.
---
Seems like you are just angry that no one liked an idea of yours.
---
Fail a speech check whilst wearing the Assault Marine Helmet
---
Why kill the stingwings or dogs that can kill the cattle when you can shoot at the squatch.  Makes sense right!!!!    :)
---
Is this the sims or fallout???
---
Do you have perks that reduce its weight or legendary armor that reduces weapon weight?
---
Full screen mode, without a doubt. If you play Borderless you cut your fps by half.
---
1440p on a 970 is doable but you'll need to play on Medium or below settings. Cut the SHADOW setting first as it's the most taxing feature.
---
Fusion. Honestly dont think iv seen plasma cores yet but my highest lvl is 31 so many things i havent seen yet.
---
It's fallout. If I want to play Farmville I'll go play Farmville. As it is the wastelands are surprisingly warm and fuzzy and a little boring.
---
You got that backwards my friend; reports &amp; bans work with chat-logs and then if you're reported they check the chat-log (which just records all the junk you typed into chat that they'll have and observe if you're being reported a lot) that is, if Bethesda was smart or clever - which they haven't been looking lately so probably no text-chat until they decide it's worth the time and money to implement (they probably will make more atom-shop stuff tho since that's worth their time and money) Sadly what I wrote might be all true.
---
Bethesda prove me wrong!
---
ha that is great
---
Haven't tried the combination but I remember a reply in that thread saying it does with a bowler of that helps.
---
Hopefully this link works fine

---
Terrible texture review on Bethesda’s part.  They just lost a sale.  Shame.
---
all pvp mechanics in this game are shit... PvE is not well exploited... they could make a BR but... with 20 players? I see it really hard to be true... however I also expected a more refined game on everything and they fail me so... I guess is possible.
---
Tbh the only thing I expect for the game are robo companions... I see it dumb to not have a NPC companions option on a world way more peacefull and full of robots than on F4 where I had the chance to make robot companions... but looking things missing like f4 elevator for CAMPs or a properly patched CAMP... meh...
---
Red can only spawn in the showers, but you’re going to be grinding a long time for it. I’ve only found one, with buying the rest of mine. I am not sure what event you’re talking of.
---
I'd rather they do a Dead by Daylight or Secret Neighbor style minigame in a simulation vault like Tranquility Lane. Have one player be picked as the killer and the others have to try and escape.
---
Huh. I made a post about this like a week or two ago, and here we are again. I love reddit lol
---
The Bethesda Fallouts have terrible stories. They keep reaching for what they think is low-hanging fruit, but it's just stuff rotting on the ground.
---
But what do they care? It makes money.
---
i saw some fan fantasy art....
---
Bye.
---
....
---
Why not just get your 1400 caps per day, after 10 days go to a player vendor and buy the legendary you want?
---
That's how I got my two shot explosive shotgun....
---
I have yet to play the event... I've been giving my low level salesman some screen time. But the more I hear about it the more fun it sounds.
---
It really sounds like more of a challenge than the queen or the sheepsquatch, requiring more coordination. Can't wait to try it.
---
*a loud BANGING sound can be heard on the second floor repeatedly *
---
Or and this may blow your mind. I'd rather type to people than have to hear them eat or drink or listen to the loud music they have playing in the background.
---
OMG, I would be there in a heartbeat.  Even if they're one star legendaries, I'm bound to get a couple gems to vend after killing as many as I can before the timer runs out.
---
Well... of your price is so high that no one is willing to buy then your price IS to high because it may as well not be for sale at all. Also if your bid is so low than no one is welling to sell to you then your price again IS wrong because you arent even shopping.
---
Goes well with the BoS Hood. Got that combo with the Pastor's Vestments :)
---
They spawn only on the third floor, in both bed rooms on the bottom bunk of one bunk bed, and on the bench in the bathroom by the showers.
---
Also did you really find the red one in there? People have told me you can only get it from an event and that’s it
---
I’m still playing solo and a bit pissed that challenges require teams. I can’t even complete the Pioneer Scouts because of the revive an ally and a couple of the other badge challenges requiring other players. Took over a week and multiple server hops just to find three royal jelly. Seems like every step forward has at least two steps back.
---
oh welcome to my world playing from latin america in pvp vs any player since beta, i never hit shit even if vats is telling me you have 90% chance or something, teleporting to the player but hitting nothing because he was there like a sec ago not right now lol 
---
only chance is manual aim and spray and pray 
---
so i just happily play pvesad
---
I have absolutely 0 interest in BR. If I want that shite I’ll play Fortnite. But as far as FO is concerned it’s a nope for me
---
Thank you for visiting and enjoying the local attractions! 
---
Did you by chance try the electric chair ride?
---
I've been stuck in that spot before during a nuke; wasn't fun and had to relog.
---
You have chest piece blueprint?
---
While it's nice, I'd recommend keeping your camp at a safe distance from whitesprings. I had someone earlier place what looked like a sloppy nuke until I realized he aimed it to hit three different camps in/near whitesprings.
---
Two shot EXPLOSIVE is still the meta.
---
Radaway can help with that.
---
Oof sorry. I never thought this post would get this much attention tbh and just posted it out of frustration of the idea and how it will go over to most people interested in Fallout
---
I literally have gunsmith cards from rank 1 to rank 5 individually, as well as 5 different demolition expert cards.  Makes for a lot of options, at least.
---
Broken for me as well. I was able to check off the creation of items, but playing them does not seem to work at all.
---
I clear it without power armor.  I use a silenced rifle and can usually one shot them.  If you mess up just run out through the main entrance which acts as a bottle neck which should give you sometime.
---
imagine when they all let lose, you will no longer be overencumbered.
---
melee weapons do damage once its kicked in from tesla...
---
Nothing else though.
---
Good call.  I was going to try the traditional look with a top hat and carry a wood stick (sledgehammer minus the head), but the clipping is a no-go for me.
---
They said this about Titanfall BR yet apex legends was huge...
---
Nobody trusts a skinny cook
---
Yes. I’ve been stockpiling level points now and fine tuning my build as I go. After level 75 there isn’t much use for the points unless you need to respec
---
Most underrated feature of this game
---
Block button. Hold it when they’re charging at you, murder them when they pull up short from the collision
---
With no rad resist on your normal gear, a L62 charred can hit you for... 74 rad damage if I recall
---
This is just what I’ve ben looking for.
---
Great job!
---
Would it be safe to say you’d prefer this feature to clean up your perk list? Haha
---
15 - 20 minutes with less than 5 stimpacks used, providing you're mutated with Healing Factor and some others.
---
Build is 2 hander, NON bloodied-junkie. 
---
Instigating 2h is what makes it shine. You literally one shot everything. Don't even need PA if your resists are 300 across the board (except radiation).
---
Any rain will do. Camera must take a photo of an actual character I guess (AI or human), unconfirmed if billboards or other quest objectives count.
---
Anyone else know?
---
What platform are u??????
---
I have 2 for sale in my vending machine for 75 caps on xbox
---
I have one locked and one for free.
---
Cause I can make u one
