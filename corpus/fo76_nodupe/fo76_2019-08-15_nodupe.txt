\&gt;I want bloodied nerfed to the same level as other gear
---

---
\&gt;but then there is no point in playing at 19% health
---
\&gt;deletes post
---
I see you're back at your shenanigans
---
---
---
“A little less” is not half.
---
This is why I stopped playing the division all together. Its just not fun at all wasting tons of ammo to bring down an enemy for what, a 100 xp and a nocturnal meat hook?
---
I had a teammate doing this during Guided Meditation so I kicked them and they rejoined so I got the satisfaction of kicking them again and blocking them. I know it isn't the best payback but at least they knew it wasn't accidental and that's a small victory in my book.
---
*Thank you for spending caps to get to my camp*
---
Afaik yes. I used to only farm my tech data from the Whitesprings bunker. There can be up to 4 at once in the desks of the main coms room, the one next to the nuke codes. Only grab 1 at a time. There is a bug that if you have 1 on you, the quest won't pop for a second one. 
---
Simple. Find 1. Turn it in. Repeat. It. Takes. Forever.
---
I've started putting all my excess plans at 10 caps, unless its something super rare which none of the ultracite stuff is, except maybe calibrated shocks. Its been nice to have these things finally moving from my stash.
---
After season 2, I'll be rebuilding my entire camp to accommodate the rewards
---
Have you ever considered meleeing it with your gun? Pretty damn easy fix right there
---
I need the BoS bunker in my life
---
I'm going to guess that the game sometimes forgets what choices you made during player specific quests as there a lot of stuff like that.
---
Beckett sometimes reacts as though you killed his brother instead of saving him.
---
Settlers will act like I took explosive charges to do raider 79 raid when I sided with the settlers on that char.
---
Lots of little things.
---
More atrocious stuff, yay.
---
Well look at that, I passed that post about someone wanting a hammock earlier and now here it is
---
vampire's, too. there are other viable builds, just not builds that output the same damage as bloodied.
---
rightfully so. what's the point of bloodied if you can output the same damage with any other prefix? makes no sense.
---
Youd think with as many legendary stats available there would be a decent variety.
---
Right, I run an Executioners/Furious/Junkies build and I melt shit just fine
---
\*Laughs\*   
---
High risk/high reward?Never was high risk.   
---
Right now I abuse the system I use a BE heavy or split/shotty with a piece of magic armor. I die more often from that than when I run a commando/rifleman build.
---
It’s the western duster, I’ve had it for quite some time now
---
Bethesda has not shown any level of awareness to any other part of their game thus far, why would they start thinking that way now?  
---
They cannot even fix basic, longstanding bugs; I honestly doubt they'll be able to balance EVERYTHING out. Not a chance.
---
And I see you're still upset that your Baby-Easy Build is getting a time-out.
---
Those and the hanging string lights were my go-to! I miss the string lights too, they had great light output and looked good too.
---
Yeah projector only does 180° instead of 360 like a normal one and oh yeah projects on the ground instead of the ceiling?!? Wtf Bethesda!!
---
Wall decor.  I finished the legendary run and I found in inwall decor section of build menu
---
Look why you gotta attack Ben Shapiro like that on a fallout reddit?
---
Berserkers don't use any armor at all: Fireproof, Adamantium Skeleton, Lone Wanderer (if you're not teaming up), Sneak/Escape Artist, Serendipity, and Ricochet. If your Agility is high you can also use Dodgy, you should have a high endurance with Life Giver at max rank and Rejuvenated for the HP bonuses (Berserker characters can also make good food builds), and Vampire's weapons are just as important as Berserker ones
---
Oh damn, now Pistol wielders will prevent the Queen from landing because of the shitty stagger* effect.
---
It looks like a texture off of the screaming eagle paint
---
that's not an argument my guy
---
It makes the game more of a challenge. Which could be a good thing in the end game! But generally, I’m very annoyed too. I would try things out and see if you still do well enough after the patch goes through, but it may cause some people to quit.
---
Exacty, all these folks cheering for the nerf will be asking for SBQ and Colossal Problem nerfs after they arent getting carried anymore.
---
[removed]
---
Apparently it affects more than just bloodied builds.
---
Junkies builds will make you super tanky
---
Which is bull that should be bezerker. No armor no legendary perks other than weapon. Bloodied os far easier than zerk.
---
As a simple half-health build (unyielding for the mild stat bonus and adrenal reaction cause why not) I agree. 1000 damage... 1400 damage.... 2000... Most still dead either way.
---
Game wasn't meant to solo the queen in 38 seconds or whatever.
---
I'm not any main build and I still one shot nearly anything 
---
*maybe shoot or vats faster?*
---
I might have to defect as well. Fallout 1 and 2 just do that to me oh!
---
Even if that was the case it wasn't working ***specifically with unarmed weapons***. All my other weapons were doing the same paper damage as before. Even if it was indirect it would still be an ***unarmed nerf***.
---
I believe through finishing the run. Not fo1st exclusive.
---
all five allies have occasional quests you can do. sofia and beckett's occasional quests may give you random legendary weapons, and if you romanced them then the "kindred spirit" buff from sleeping in a bed gets upgraded to "lover's embrace". basically the same as well rested, but it lasts three hours.
---
really, the "best ally" to have at your camp is whichever one you can listen to repeat their dialogue a million times and not want to blow their head off. basically, go with whoever you like best.
---
It’s not hard to control griefing in that zone. 
---
|S——S|This is a PvP zone—|PvP
---
|A——A|Do not proceed——|PvP
---
|F——F|Unless you’re willing|PvP
---
|E——E|To PvP. Danger!——|PvP
---
Basically anywhere in the SAFE zone cannot be damaged by another player regardless.
---
Anyone who crossed into the second zone by accident is physically stopped and a dialogue box comes up warning them if they move any further they will be labelled for PvP if they proceed (this zone could be 10 yards wide for argument sake), and anyone in the PvP area can be targeted and killed. This allows you to dupe your entire inventory if you jump into the yellow zone and die at the same time.
---
This game is not called " dont tagg all the legendaries" either.....sooooooo
---
Looks like the shopping center in the mire.  The name escapes me at this moment though.
---
What's there to argue?
---
Bloodied is overpowered and it's getting toned down.
---
You can deny it's status all you want, but that's what's happening.
---
If you're ahead of the other piece on the board you're on track
---
Damn, this is so cool! Some people's camps are so creative!
---
One of the best suggestions I've read was making all of the mounted heads known by default to all new characters and removing the plans from the game.
---
Yeah, I suspected that was a much bigger thing than the patch note made it out to be. They might have buried the lead on this one.
---
They made tank killer work with pistols too... damn man if you kept your perks/pistols it should be easier to swap back. I wish you the best.
---
That classic bos bunker shell is what I'm after
---
PC here.  It been a while for me as well. Not sure when it started, but it's been at least since I came back just before wastelanders iirc.
---
Another good reason for skins. Or just a lock favorite items so they cant be sold.
---
Level 77
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Nji1wR3q5hoHOKwKQWnK5p1qhtub7O64XPGZxeimpI/edit?usp=drivesdk
---
Always been like that
---
*you* were arguing that other prefixes should deal the same damage as bloodied with no real penalty.
---
which is stupid as hell.
---
More seem to show up during double exp weekend. It seems a little slow right now. Most the people I play with are taking a break and have finished the board and the event being pushed back didn't help.
---
Makes sense, since the BoS are heading in from the west, so this is probably themed after them
---
Oh I know where you’re talking about, a 3 star super mutant normally spawns and frags me with a Missile put front so I tend to stay away
---
Wish i had the time for that
---
Cool, thanks for the quick reply!
---
Sweet, thank you for the very quick reply!
---
[deleted]
---
Hey, so it may be a bug
---
It’s glitches though....with Patch 21
---
Then play WoW
---
what about those of us who have magic shotguns? may we be allied with you? or is this a magic heavy gun exclusive club
---
Ahahaha my TSE assault rifle will rise from the ashes once more
---
Pretty sure that's a stick in a cement pail
---
Sadly, I think it's just a normal sledge
---
Ok if I’m not wrong, 51 is Zax’s vault....if they’re preparing that vault for future content does that mean I can finally blow him to bits??
---
The bobble head foosball table is a interesting addition. Looks cool.
---
First come first served.
---
Pretty sure tank killer is just armor pen "on rifles".  Tormentor is the perk that adds a cripple chance.
---
And the not landing thing people blame on stagger effects like those found on enforcer and one gun army.  They both also happen to have the cripple effect, bit it's the stagger people dont like.
---
No no....he’s got a point
---
If that’s the case I... I don’t know. In my opinion what they should’ve done was maybe nerf bloodied &amp; junkies a tad and brought other legendary perks up to a similar if not same damage buff. ill still play to see how it is but I have a feeling this will fuck with a lot of people’s enjoyment of the game
---
I have 6 as well 😁
---
Whatever - guess I will adapt - but it is pretty frustrating to spend hours and hours and days and months perfecting and refining builds based on the existing game mechanics, and grinding to get the right gear for that build just to have them change those game mechanics  ... 
---
for me running bloodied is a lot to do with ammo conservation as much as the satisfaction of quick precise kills - - I agree with those who don’t want to spend all of their time in the game farming ammo :( rip
---
i think they only had that with the Wastelanders pts to prevent story spoilers. most of what's coming now is just gameplay stuff or events with minor, if any, stoy to them. i expdct it'll be back to "NDA needed" once Steel Dawn and Fractured Steel come to the PTS.
---
Yeah, they’re working on it the same way they’ve been working on the  challenges to discover locations in each zone.  That’s been bugged since day 1.
---
Shhh. It's okay to be upset. Let it all out.
---
Why not both?  More gambling, more buying and selling.  All seems fine to me.
---
The guitar girl?
---
Ffs they really hit Junkies too....
---
No sorry, still have it.  Like I said I have never had it not work but know it can fail on me at any time.  Just shoved it in there and hoped for the best throwing caution to the wind.  At the end of the day it is just 1's and 0's on a hard drive.
---
I think it was New Gad, that sounds right!
---
I am now disappointed on two fronts!
---
Still I love the rewards this Season!
---
How'd you get it?
---
Sorry, it was stagger you’re right. Tank Killer has both.
---
yeah, I'm checking the forums as well. having said that, now I'm curious as to what exactly the 'new interactions between buffs' entails.
---
even if it's just a bug, and that seems to be the case given a ton of stuff is broken, that doesn't mean bloodied won't be nerfed.
---
I think the backlash is a good thing anyway. shows a lot of players are highly reliant on bloodied weapons.
---
Oh no, it takes me 20 bullets instead of 12 to kill the tankiest non-event enemy in the game, the horror! Wait just realized that's a level 100 one, literally tankier than anything we have in the current version of the game short of the SBQ
---
they're still doing stuff for wood armor? yet there's nothing for raider armor, ffs.
---
2 servers it worked ...
---
Is Armor Ace really an appropriate name for season 2? Shit reeks of Communism
---
Thank you my Goodman
---
What i would love to see instead is a challenge unlock, that refreshes your daily challenge board or unlocks a more complex challenge with some decent score rewarded.
---
Daily is rough even for the hardcore player. Logging in every day just cause is a hassle even tho I end up playing for an hour or so. Ha, good times tho. Enjoy the game for what it is.
---
The old guy down stairs?
---
Holy....if bloodied does 175 damage what should I expext from my Anti armor? 
---
Guess i'll die.
---
In theory yes, but reality is daunting. \*Places Full T-65 set on display logs out...Logs in next day and armor is gone....Mole rats?!?
---
There's just five allies right now, the only "secret one" is the Settler Wanderer and she's a random spawn at a few locations
---
[](/ktwiconfused)Why did it gain range?
---
favorite Fallout moment in general is playing fallout 3 (my first fallout game), leaving Vault 101, and seeing the capital building and washington monument in the distance with noticable damage to them. that feeling of "wow. this is the US capitol, and its been fucking destroyed" really hit me.
---
then i saw a giant rat and beat it to death with a baseball bat, and thought "okay, so we arent gonna be THAT serious, got it."
---
really set my expectations for the franchise as a whole.
---
favorite 76 moment, and a close second fallout mlment in general, is the time in 76 that i ran out of ammo halfway through killing a deathclaw so i beat it death with a shovel. mainly cuz it felt full-circle with how i started lol
---
My TSE25 Handmade will be the pinnacle again!
---
Shotguners can also be part of the Magic club.
---
The event should be able to be completed by doing exactly ALL of the weekly challenges. Then there should be smaller very easy daily challenges, that are more of a bonus/catch up.  
---
Weekly: kill 100 scorched 
---
Daily: survive a jump off a tall cliff
---
Weekly: claim 5 workshops
---
Daily: make 100 caps selling to a vendor 
---
Weekly: survive for 60 minutes in NW
---
Daily: log in
---
That kind of stuff
---
Not gonna lie, I did something similar.  My main is a junkie pa hesvy tank.  I decided to make a stealth commando with some of the commando weapons and scout armor I'd found on my main.
---
My commando alt is now lvl 64 and I have no drive to continue playing them.  The only reason to continue would be to grind better gear, but I can get the best gear more readily on my main, and my alt doesnt know enough mods to kit out the gear they do get.  It all comes back to my.main anyway.  So my alt is more of another option.
---
Possibly place holders on the PTS servers, not necessarily final product.
---
I believe there should be an outfit and 3 new weapons to go with.
---
I found 5. Daguerre, Beckett, the wanderer, the Raider radio host and the old guy at Foundation
---
It could give luck another use
---
glad to hear it.  spread th word when this pops up again
---
So how about working some of that additive magic on mutant’s guns
---
also not an argument
---
That means their getting closer!
---
This!!!
---
they will... FOR SURE all new content thusfar has brought new currency... scrip, tadpole and possum badges, and now bullion.. I can almost PROMISE a new currency... They did say they would eventually bring in "expeditions" i bet the new currency is supply requisitions from the brotherhood earned on expiditions....
---
Why do devs feel the need to nerf good builds instead of buffing crap builds
---
I hope they do nerf it. Its exhausting having to deal with all the bloodied fotm players. It's so common and often ruins events.
---
Yeah nah it's not a high risk. Your only weakness is very high rads or poison, both of which are fairly predictable and therefore avoidable. In all other circumstances you can cheese it by sneaking right under enemy noses, one-shotting nearly everything, and tanking with serendipity/nerd rage/dodgy
---
I'm wearing a fullset of Vanguard SS armor and using a junkies build
---
I suggest using PA for thougher enemies  untill u reach lvl 50 then u can decide if u wanna use normal armor.  If u dont have the plans for SS armor i'd suggest scout armor. My full set of vanguard sentinel scout armor is a bit weaker than the SS set i have because it doesnt gives me enough rad protection against charred ghouls. 
---
With the SS armor i can wander into nuke zones with +17rads/s
---
I had this same issue, ask them to unlink you Bethesda account that was the only thing that helped me
---
Gotta finish the board
---
This isn't the first time I've seen someone talking about another companion. I can't remember any details but there was another post a while ago and the OP was 100% certain there was another one.
---
hitchhikers reference? NOICE!
---
So
---
The guass shotgun will regularly miss enemies that you could poke in the eye without moving but then drop an enemy that is behind a tree that you cannot even see. It will also take 3 shots to kill a level 32 ant that was fighting the level 91 deathclaw you one shot. 
---
You will also probably blow yourself up quite a bit until you learn to jump while shooting or take precautions like equipping fireproof. I jump a lot.
---
BUT despite all this i love it. It's very ammo friendly.
---
Maybe now people will stop one-shotting them. Seen it happen more and more.
---
But we're not arguing, so why would it be?
---
If I had to guess, next season the repeatable will be public events not xp
---
Believe it or not game development is really hard, and from what I understand the team on 76 are mostly new to the industry or at the very least this is their first BIG title. I show alot of leniency towards the devs because we dont know the work environment or how they do things. I agree they need to be more transparent but personally for a bunch of college graduates and some senior devs the game is in a good place.
---
Stop telling people how to play.
---
Ad Victorium, brother.
---
maybe you're not. can't blame you. no way to justify having prefixes deal the same damage as bloodied. better resort to snarky remarks.
---
Daily ops are not catered to new players either...
---
Well, time to respec to a "magic" build and kill SBQ in *seconds* instead of minutes. See how much these people are cheering then.. 😂
---
Bloodied and Junkies didn't need a nerf. It was everything else needed a buff! But people were too butthurt to care, and now the only real functional builds have been crippled just in time for everything in the wasteland to start scaling up to your level.
---
"Magic" builds are now the new meta, and the people cheering for this change are shortsighted.
---
I thought it was only if you were on top of the tent it bugged her out?
---
This is not a Bloodied nerf, this is an everything nerf. Bloodied is only hit the hardest because of the absurd amount of things that stacked on it. Junkies is also nerfed. Berserker is also nerfed. Stealth damage is massively nerfed if its 2.00~3.75x is now calculated the same way.
---
Two-Shot and Explosive are probably the things left standing most intact in the ashes because their damage doesn't come from more modifier effects but actual separate shots. Anti-Armor also may fare better now since it works by reducing enemy armor effectiveness instead of buffing damage directly. Likewise with anything that simply 'shoots more' like high-speed Heavy Guns.
---
If I find camps with them listed cheap I buy ALL of them and dump them either in the bottom of a lake/pond or go die with them on me in a fissure site. It helps with my sanity
---
I want a raid style event for Whitesprings! You mean to tell me there's sealed off rich people rooms and none of them have some fancy pre-war loot? The enemy infrastructure is there just let me piss off the robots~
---
I did Justify it. I can't help it if you refuse to accept the justification though. I also can't help it that this is getting under your skin so badly!
---
Cool town mate!  
---
Please, make a video too!
---
Bloodied is still the best in damage but can you imagine how much worse every other legendary prefix is gonna get hit? It's gonna get seriously bad across the board.
---
Bloodied was never a glass cannon.
---
What camp budget?
---
your post is not even showing lol
---
I don't know why you're getting all uppity like that. pvpers talk about pvp, pvers talk about pve, mmoers talk about, oh the horror, the mmo aspect of the game.
---
except they don't. nobody does. because there aren't mmo players around. not to any considerable degree. and that's saying a lot when even pvpers have a voice here.
---
people who enjoy grinding in Fo76 just don't exist. sorry but your opinion piece does not reflect the playerbase by and large. it's as simple as that.
---
The only thing that could make me more hype is if they brought back Goris the Talking Albino Deathclaw as a camp ally with a questline 
---
I don't care that it breaks lore just gimme
---
It's still pretty good. Won't work well on EVERYTHING, but it's still a solid combo, especially since they complement each other. The people who say TSE is garbage are the people who say that anything other than bloodied unyielding is garbage
---
Same, my stash box is worthless now.
---
I hope so,but it's not mentioned in the notes. Being just a bug fix, I expect it for next patch in september.
---
Ah yes, more communist outfits... this pleases me.
---
That's my point, they should have nerfed it by actually turning it into a high risk high reward class
---
The minigun is awesome have one that shreds through everything the plasma caster is good to,try and get a instagating or bloodied one and it's really good mine does 200 damage to the queen
---
we‘ll see about that. running my first one now.
---
Ad Mortem!
---
How did junkies see the decrease? Wouldn’t the decrease from junkies be the same as every other effect (except bloodied)?
---
you never did. you just deleted the post. there's no justification for mutant's, a prefix with virtually no drawbacks, to deal the same damage as bloodied.
---
there literally isn't.
---
Yeah because they already have insane damage while also having above average attack speed, they don't need damage perks and they're still OP
---
I work at night, sleep most of the day and when i get on at all i gotta rush to finish the dailes before the timer expires. Because when it expires i'm supposed to be at work.
---
These dailies are no longer gaming, and my life is a 24 hour chore. So i'd appreciate some understanding from those desk jockeys for those who actually have an exhausting job to make it a little easier for everyone.
---
Its probably just bugged in the pts, junkies lost some dmg just wait and see.
---
Trapper armor has also been excluded from both seasons for some reasons. Odd.
---
Damn, just as I rolled UNY SS Armor :(
---
Pip-Boy Foosball Table Rank 99 callin it now!

Every single change in this game is backwards. More bugs than before. More chores and grind. Less fun. They should just give up updating and fire all developers and managers.
---
Unyielding wasn’t changed. Just the way the boosts from it work, IE strength and int wont scale the same way. 
---
It’s still very, very good. Keep it.
---
It's about balance, the core of it isn't really changing.
---
Then I guess you missed it.
---
Either way, it doesn't bother me that it upsets you or that you want an explanation.
---
Stay salty my friend.
---
That isn’t true, the studio that made 76 was new but they handled launch in such an abysmal way that BGS had to step in and work on it for them.
---
At least Murmrgh won’t be the most hated NPC vendor anymore...
---
This. I hope more people see this. Sure, bloodied and junkies were the most *noticable*, but it’s really this.
---
Not even the community  manager knows if this is intended or not .  Here is his respond to the concerns ;

---
I suggest a wait and see appproch before panicking too much
---
So instead of bloodied builds it’ll be instigating adrenal nerd rage builds!
---
I BoUgHt ThE gAmE sO I sHoUlD bE aBlE tO PlAy aS I wAnT
---
thank you for helping our world spin round without the weight of these f’ing plans!
---
Grind don’t stop
---
Oh my god they made it garbage
---
Bro that shooting game looks rad
---
This is a really important point to make. I switched to a low-health build a few weeks ago, not because of bloodied but because unyielding armor gives a massive boost to intelligence, which is useful for getting XP for the legendary run and leveling up for legendary perks.
---
To expand on this, only Beckett and Sophia (astronaut lady) have a real quest line. You can swap them at any time by scrapping their camp item and building the one for the ally you want. Quest progress is kept.
---
I wonder if BE laser rifles will still be viable
---
there's no explanation. there's no drawback to mutants, unlike bloodied.
---
this is really all there is to it.
---
not to mention, if you want every prefix to perform like bloodied, then why not just play bloodied? it seems to me you're irrationally angry at a game mechanic.
---
Looking at their support page for that it makes it sound like I could lose progress, purchased items and currencies and is not specific for which games. That makes it seem very unappealing. What exactly do I lose?
---
I've scrapped more unyielding thorn armor than I care to count at this point. All I wanted was weapon weight reduction
---
Finally, my magic combat shotgun will not be laughed at by my Bloodied build friends!
---
Hopefully...
---
I know it didn’t change, but now that bloodied has been nerfed o don’t think the trade off of health for damage is viable now
---
This is only the PTS. This isn’t in the game yet.
---
Yes but the polar opposite? Basically years?
---
6 cards maxed require about 1000+ levels. I bet your friend list is full of people at that level. The avarage in any server is about 80....
---
Fixes for game-breaking issues take weeks or months, important features like perk loadouts are shoved off to half a year after they are announced. They are clearly very, very limited on resources. Is this really what they should be prioritizing right now?
---
Cool. I just got to level 35 on it I think. Why grind and bitch about it?
---
I'm done here buddy, bye-bye!
---
I hope you manage to grow up someday!
---
Hasn’t been invented yet, and isn’t found in casinos
---
You on PC by any chance?
---
It’s a grind. I had to turn in over 400 tech docs before I unlocked it.
---
Explosive shotguns work extremely well with VATS, not much good without but magic with.
---
I am a full health heavy PA and with this nerf, bloodied and junkies will still be doing for damage then me. 
---
🤷‍♂️.
---
Launch a nuke or two and spam the lunchbox emote. Pop one and hope others pop it. Have your ally xp buff &amp; any other food xp buffs you can get. I like to then kill everything at west tec, Huntersville &amp; then the steakhouse. Afterwards I switch servers &amp; kill those super mutants again. If your lunchbox xp buff is about to run out, you can always pop one more &amp; maintain 100% bonus buff
---
You act like it's not going to be viable anymore. It's still gonna be good.
---
Oh really? I didn't know that, assuming your right then the recent positivey is due to more competent devs. Sweet
---
Really wanted to take a break from Fallout 76 after Season 1 ended.
---
Guess I'm not doing that now. There's just TOO MANY COOL COSMETICS TO PASS UP.
---
its the new daily op mission location
---
i cant remember what its called
---
that's not entirely true. outside PA you're a wet noodle. serendipity is like tossing a coin and is the very definition of 'unreliable'. same with sentinel, even a full set.
---
not an argument, again.
---
yeah its super annoying having to fast travel away all the time just to play the damn game
---
All those CAMP updates without any expansion of CAMP capacity and/or STASH capacity is worthless.

Thnx, I’ll go super mutant hunting right away then!
---
Oof my armor doesn’t like the sound of that.
---
Bethesda: We shall not be removing dailies, in fact we are introducing hourly's.
---
I think that, in this regard (the mobile game style daily sh!te), it's more on the business side pushing this sort of play/reward system than the devs. I mean, it literally *only* makes sense to encourage/reward daily play if the game has a significant cash-flow from in-game advertising and such. But this game doesn't, which in turn makes the reinforcement of players doing trivial and repetitive "challenges" seem completely unnecessary. I dunno the facts, but I wouldn't be surprised if the product owner or a director level exec comes from a mobile game background because whomever made the design decision to push daily chores on a non-mobile MMO player base definitely isn't coming to it from a "traditional" MMO background. I would think that anyone with that sort of background would instinctively understand how much of a sh!t experience in-game chores are.
---
Yeah, but there is way more to mmo games than grind.
---
You showed your true colours by claiming that all you know about an mmo is a grind and that the only thing people who enjoy MMOs like is grinding.
---
It's judgy, childish and bigoted.
---
Then you better choose carefully, the system is made to be that way. Wouldn't be very special or important if you could grind it out in a week or 2. Your supposed to think carefully about your choices.
---
I’ll bet that’ll also be the instanced stuff so you’ll have a separate budget for the inside
---
Terminator, coming for revenge
---
*laughs in broken unyielding set*
---
Wait so it’s only a 60% buff now or it’s down 60% what it used to be
---
Some enemies have a minimal level I believe.
---
Don’t Nerf Bloodied Bethesda!!!
---
Yeah but now they do similar damage to a weapon with fast speed like the switchblade. My switch blade with same amount of perks points attacks much faster than any of my unarmed weapons only does roughly 30-60 less damage but I can use it in power armor too. 
---
That is with the talons mutation. 
---
A Mole miner gauntlet with extra blades is weaker than a switch blade. 
---
Its just makes unarmed weapons unusable compared to the other melee weapons. It cut unarmed weapons damage straight in half.
---
Perk Loadouts are coming.
---
Nothing, u less you make another Bethesda account instead of relinking to that one when you sign into the game
---
Is your camp at max budget of glitched? 🤔 Or your vendors near spawn 
---
It's kinda easy to initiate this glitch if someone really wants to get into your stash
---
Do you still have one, I’m still grinding for one.
---
Now we just need someone to be able to do Gregory chant
---
Inspirational (15%) 15 int, full unyielding, cranberry relish (herbivore) egghead, strange in numbers, herd mentality, cranberry juice, brain fungus soup, well rested and if possible 4 lunchboxes, leader bobble or int bobble  Before you load yourself up hunt for your own path. I have one that in 15 minutes yields over 30k exp, then I either hop servers or go to my alternate path which is about 20-25K.
---
One of the important factors also is that you can kill fast I mean stupidly fast to maximize.
---
Also if you know about the unyielding double stat glitch or you just randomly get it stay on that server and just farm farm farm nothing like 60-63 int.
---
93% from the int all sources (124% if double stat glitched)15% insp25% relish5% (well rest)5% juice(100% lunch)5% leader5% live and love 8
---
So 148-179% plus 100% from lunchboxes.
---
If I missed any since I am sure someone will cherry pick sorry this is what I normally run myself.  Though I think I am down to just two more bobbles.  
---
Edit berry mentats but kind of a waste unless you have 100% chem time perk but that is 10% also I have not seen a hard cap on int for xp. It is clear playing normal unyield vs double glitch.
---
Here to help if needed.
---
Stack all of the xp buffs you can and get your intelligence as high as possible. I use herbivore mutation and cranberry relish and get 25% bonus xp with Strange in Numbers. Also full set of unyielding along with brain fungus soup or brain bombs to boost intelligence further. Always well rested, stack lunchboxes when possible for the max xp bonus. Also join building teams for int boost.
---
Then run through Westek and Huntersville for nice xp. Also farm events. Line in the sand can be crazy xp if some uses the FO1st tent to cause all the scorched to spawn at the sonic generator.
---
I said that because this topic is about grinding specifically. I couldn't care less what you talk about or how you perceive yourself.
---
the point is that mmo players talk about mmo things. and grinding is one of them. mmo players are usually more favorable to grinding than pvers, too.
---
and surprise, surprise: nobody talks about grinding, or the mmo aspect of the game for that matter. unless it's to criticize it.
---
That looks absolutely amazing.
---
Bunker prefab? dark red Marine, Scout, SS and Robot Armor?
---
This is going to be the best fucking season ever!
---
Only worth it reward is the sheepsquatch plushie
---
Or even Harold as a npc... 
---
Gimme
---
Well they added a sink and there is already the chemical shower? You wouldn't enjoy that feature? Granted, I worded it kinda douchey but we all love building and more options for running water is always a fun thing right?
---
I made my first bloodied build like a month ago because I was tired of every enemy being a bullet sponge. Given the current season is almost over and I've pretty much burnt myself out completing it I'm content to just stop playing and find something else to play if this goes live.  I hate games with low lethality both ways.
---
There was one datamined a long time ago.  It would make your Pipe Rifle look like the Sten.
---
Hmm so only unarmed damage was changed and all other melee damage has remained the same in the pts? 
---
Hmm that is curious 
---
Idk, I hope they don't nerf unarmed into the ground like you're saying, but the less weapons capable of one-shotting everything in the game the better imo
---
PUNJI BOARDS, PUNJI BOARD STACKS, YOU WAN'EM WE GOT'EM, GETCHA PUNJI BOARD STACK HERE, 2 FOR 12,000 3 FOR 20,000!
---
If you’re using a heavy weapon that has a spin down sequence (I.E Minigun) you cant use a stimpack while it’s spinning down, but a single pull of your trigger (or click if you’re on pc) during the spinning down cancels the effect and you can use stimpacks again. Saved me from death by ghoul many times!
---
Yeah I will withhold judgement until it rolls out -
---
They need to make a cap gun similar to the junk jet. You can just blast gift players with 25 caps per shot.
---
I’m near the overseer’s home but just far enough up a mountain that all spawns are below my estate. I haven’t hit max budget either, this character is based more to power-level than to decorate- my other is the decorator with max budget though, but not the one this happened on, not sure if that matters.
---
Its my screenies, same load out + stats for both screenies
---
Actually, yes. Same name, camp currently just north of Whitespring RR Station.
---
I'm on and off. 🐻
---
Hol up I ain’t done yet.
---
What?? Someone did the exact same thing to me yesterday!
---
All of them around level 10. They bought absolutely everything. 
---
Luckily they did not succeed as I got plenty rich that day. 
---
But I’ll keep this in mind thank you!!!
---
Will it allow you to switch the points around?
---
Thank you for spending your caps to make more room for the same plans  *(~‾▿‾)~*
---
Keep wasting your scrip its hilarious
---
If you have the Future-Tec CAMP skin, that's your cause.
---
So happy im starting a new job before this next season, im gonna spend all my money on this stuff lmao
---
Wear broken armor. No damage resistance but you still get the perks, as far as i can tell
---
I don't think they have fully disclosed how it will work.
---
I'LL TAKE 12!!
---
That would be an amazing reference yeah 
---
Has he fallen into the FEV yet?
---
hmmmm
---
NEW META STRATEGY!!! CREATE A NEW CHARACTER AND KILL THE LEVEL 1 SBQ!
---
Still a shit option, one death, one rad zone and you have to repair it and break it all over again.
---
I''ve been grinding for two years mate. I don't think I should be able to max them all right away,but at least selected 6 should be. Then I would have to max the others if I need them.
---
Could have *
---
Still more dmg just not as much as before
---
Why am I not suprised. Hopefully just taking the skin off will fix it. Thanks for the fast reply!
---
Did you get the new skin for your ' my camp' from the event? Because it causes you to not have a camp icon you have to set it back to default
---
I did around 150-200 before I got it. Just saying lol.
---
IF they did this idea i wouldn't make it out of 7 i would make it out of 3 or something.
---
Huh? Once armor breaks, nothing repairs it till you do
---
Oh dear, I’m desperately hoping this doesn’t spread. It would be great if bethesda actually read my darn ticket, so they could avoid taking vending down and just nip it now. 
---
These guys were all 100+, which was honestly even more pathetic because I’m 97. 
---
Luckily I have my strongest weapons on my other char, but it sure does suck- and if it happened on her, I would be way angrier. 
---
I hope it doesn’t happen again and I’m glad you were compensated! :)
---
Already planning mine
---
Just invest in getting the secret service armor. When your level 50 and you get a solid set of that it's just as good as the medium teirs of power armor.  Plus you can have legendary effects.
---
Buy stuff for resale, serums for under 500 for resale to vendors, mags/bobbles, good plans, outfits, cryolators, tokens, and ammo
---
Country roads
---
Hopefully you haven’t put in too much effort into this new camp cuz it has to be moved again after you deselect the future tec skin. I got hit by this a week ago.
---
Oh yeah, think you are right.
---
I'm not mad about this.
---
I like this on my private server mostly because I kniw no one is one shotting those legendaries.
---
I feel like it might actually come in future updates, once the cap limit is ready to go
---
Sofia is the better kisser. Beckett has radroach breath.
---
Oh no, so I'm gonna hit for 10k Instead of 15k as a Bloodied Melee, how oh how will I find the will to live. 
---
/s
---
I hear you man!!
---
I’m gonna remove my vendor right away. I’ve spent too much time collecting every cosmetic in the game. If there’s just the slightest chance of someone entering my stash the vendor is gone immediately. 
---
And really because I imagine that Beth can’t do jack s*** about it. 
---
We gotta look out for ourselves here I guess.
---
Wtf is this.....
---
"There's a Lamp in my Boot!"
---
It is high risk when you only wear armor to make ammo and guns weigh less
---
No you don’t need to know the plan to get a legendary .50 cal.
---
That looks sweet!
---
Don't need the plan you've just been unlucky.
---
OMG
---
You were right, it was definitely lag. Just got the *privilege* of testing on a private server, my results mirrored yours.
---
That BoS bunker...Hngggggggg
---
I ran around just whipping it out to hear that noise.
---
The string lights were the best.  Great looking, sort of made sense in context.  ;-)
---
Dead ahaha
---
And instead of horse races they could add robot races like that fo4 settlement had
---
Same.  It was especially awesome to initiate combat with it put away using vats, and have the mysterious stranger show up during that turn.
---
I can craft. 500 caps with your mats or 1500 with mine (shocks only; if you don’t have legs already that’ll be a little more).
---
You can still one shot a lot of creatures with melee 1h or 2h. Theres the sheepsquatch clubs, I think the cattleprod and gutter can be rolled but I'm not too familiar, the nailer, etc, etc. 
---
Shotguns can still oneshot things with the right weapon/loadout. I suspect a lot of unarmed people with switch to shotgun. Even if its not the guass shotty the combat and double barrel are fun.  
---
One-shotting everything in game tho isn't ab issue specific to unarmed weapons and never has been. It just required less setup since mutations/theres not a of perks for it. 
---
You could one shot everything in the game with a guass pistol setup. Non-bloodied. 
---
You could oneshot everything in the game with pipe-weapons and probably still can. 
---
After this nerf you'll be ***still able to one shot creatures in melee*** but just not with ***unarmed melee.*** Like even if you maxed out all your damage with unarmed melee I don't think you'll be able to one shot a supermutant hound let alone a SB. 
---
***Maybe if you take nukashine*** but that would only get you to around the same level of damage as the average 2H swing.
---
Dope.
---
I'm not against a combat balance, but it feels poorly timed to do it at the same time as One Wasteland.
---
Do One Wasteland first, take a look at how things are, and *then* do a combat rebalance.
---
It's untill you take it off.
---
I moves??!?!?
---
&gt; That set was my favourite building set from FO4 so Im happy as hell to see that back.
---
The weird thing is that it's part of the Warehouse set in FO4. Not sure why it never came with it in FO76.
---
I've had that before, sporadically, on a PC that's about 5 or 6 years old with an Nvidia 780 (IIRC). I've tried defragging my HDD (no SSD) every now and then, specifically the Steam/FO76 files, and it's never really been confirmable if that had any improving effect.
---
While I don't run a bloodied build myself, I've heard tell that Junkies has been hit too and several other weapons have suffered damage drops - there was a mention of Final Word having taken a slight hit for example.
---
While I'm not on the PTS myself, I'm going to assume for the time being that whatever they've done has screwed things up a bit and needs tweaked and it's - not entirely at least - intentional.
---
I try pistol build but ended up switching back to heavy gunner 
---
The guass pistol break down every 15min...
---
I would say at a minimum take hard bargain off unless you are selling and replace it with tenderizer.
---
If you think bloodied is high risk you should have looked at berserker first; bloodied is full on easy mode and berserker is the real glass cannon of 76. Bloodied difficulty is a joke and it has ruined the game since it went mainstream; there is a good reason why 3/4 of players are bloodied.
---
And I just started running bloodied. Oh well. Magic shotgun it is!
---
None of that is happening.
---
Anyone think that might be the presidential t60 power armor?
---
I’ve gpt 5 or 6 instigating pipe rifles that benefit from both pistol and rifle perk cards, with covert operative and the instigating effect they routinely do like 1300 damage on a super mutant. I can one shot most enemies if I’m not in combat.
---
Not soon enough if you ask me.
---
Fuck
---
I’m just glad I can somewhat help warn people. I made this reddit just to create this, so not all is lost if I can make someone’s life easier. 
---
I’m worried Bethesda won’t do anything about my report, but I’m going to keep pushing. I love this game enough to spend much more than I should, but kind of regretting it now. Not going to let it crush my fun though, because then they’d win lol
---
Good, there needs to be a combat balance.
---
No body talks about the game they are to busy playing.
---
Damage is probably the smallest benefit of bloodied anyway.  15 INT, 15 AGI, 15 STR, 15 PER, 15 LUK is ridiculous.  Build for stealth?  Bloodied is better.  Build for XP?  Bloodied is better.  Build for melee?  Bloodied is better.  Build for crafting?  Bloodied is better.  Build for sniping?  Bloodied is better.
---
Johj
---
Agree, but I must also say as a level 498 with too much free time you eventually run out of things to buy, caps have very little purpose for us.
---
High end gear is trade-only, well, as far as there is a market left with all the dupes that have been, and the introduction of new top-tier items which are character locked. Which I think is a path BGS will go into more anyhow.
---
The OG Holliday gifts were nice cap sinks, lots of new plans etc, they should add more of those kind of things. And then yeah I suppose the proposed suggestion kind of gets there in a way, gifts were basically a gamble too.
---
I luv the greenhouse pieces. I remember using them in my vault build in FO4 to make a 2 story bar and restaurant. So pretty lit up.
---
I actually couldn’t server hop for what I wanted thanks for the offer
---
i mean .. they‘re not easy, but not hard either. but being level 50 would be good.
---
I just want to see bloodied balanced out, the era of bloodied needs to end for the sake of balancing the game properly.
---
Well they need to keep on nerfing then I guess lol
---
Thanks lol
---
At least next gen is all ssd!
---
There is a few posts on this on the forums.
---
I didn't realize a bad hard drive would cause so many problems.
---
SSHD are really cheap now.
---
you wont be disappointed if you change it.
---
the communist outfits... i think im gonna faint
---
I don't have a problem with the dailies. A few of them can be stacked (take over a workshops / do an event) and if you remember where to get bubblegum and where to find a hackable terminal that's easy. And need scorched? Clear out Morgantown Airport. Need feral ghouls? Clear out Morgantown. Like... The only hard daily might be the levelling up one, for people who are higher levels.  People should at least be able to achieve the 5/5 gold star. 
---
I come home from work, have dinner, and then log on and get the 5/5 dailies done in a couple of hours. I may not be able to play every day which may mean I don't finish this season but I'm alright with that.  People get too used to being able to have all the things these days, I know it's controversial but I'm actually ok with not getting the same level of rewards that someone else who grinded longer and harder than me did... That's just life!
---
monkey pog champ
---
Poor LMG :( that thing hasn't even got any mods
---
Got to love developers taking a shit on players.
---
That's an impressive use of Microsoft Excel. Looks like someone has been spending too much time at work, not doing work. Nonetheless, here (hope this works) is a screenshot of my Legendary Run progress. Only started a couple of weeks ago (or was it three?), but said this in another post, I ignore the challenges, just complete quests, events, loot, craft, etc .. and my progress is here: [https://ibb.co/y5mnSCb](https://ibb.co/y5mnSCb)
---
Then don't! Don't try to keep up.  Do what you can do, and get the rewards you get. Simples.
---
How about instead of a dedicated casino, they place betting games at various settlements?
---
there you go again with your circular logic. as I've pointed out before, that makes no sense.
---
True. I'm a high level myself and my build is overpowered as fk, but I always try to either shoot it with the most garbage thing I can find, or just simply give it a good old gun bash to the 4head.
---
Tho, I had lower levels instakill things in front of me too, mixed feelings lol.
---
I'd love some diversity in the builds too, **if** they made SPECIAL swaps a bit easier, but if you're a high level it'll take a while. Right now, I've been saving up to swap to a new build for...6 weeks or so, have 20 levels saved at level 255. I would love to experiment with new builds, but it needs to be simpler. Note: I play a couple days a week for a few hours, so I'm sure others could level faster.
---
Okay season 2 is going to be way better than season 1
---
You’re a good fellow!
---
To be totally honest with you I don’t think you’ll ever see those items again since Beth has said multiple times to other players that they can’t return in game items (even tho they did it once)
---
I’m so sorry for all the time you’ve spend on those items. It hurts just to hear. 
---
I do hope those suckers gets caught tho. 
---
And thanks a lot for the post!!
---
Am I the first one to request Mr Potato Head style accessories for the mannequin faces? Because I won't be the last.
---
This has happened over and over with no consideration for our time spent. You just have to roll with it and rework your build. Find some new guns. I’m numb to it now.
---
i mean at this point its a bottle of blood soda. so it should be pretty easy to do so.
---
Bulk ammo boxes that give you the crafting min. amount for ammo based on what gun you have equipped.
---
&gt;Well, time to respec to a "magic" build and kill SBQ in seconds
---
ah yes one shotting the sbq, the calling card of the permavirgin
---
How would anyone know?
---
Things tend to go in cycles and they have promised a rebalance in the future, so maybe you want to keep it.
---
Nobody here will shame you 
---
Half of us are working adults who can afford the disposable income but don’t have the time to play as often.
---
From rank1 to rank100 is about $150. If I were you I’ll wait til the last week to buy rank up
---
Thankfully.
---
I have had the best few days gaming since i changed it.
---
the fast travel was seriously annoying
---
i could put the Kettle on and make a Brew,
---
"Death from Above",the Queen had usually been dead a few hours by the time i got there..
---
Now it takes seconds.
---
Did it have communist floors/walls? A few ofy friends have them now for when I'm not on. I'm on Xbox, my GT is Black Sa1ami
---
Wonder if they then also fix the stack issue of certain pistols, not sure how or which, some pipe variant gets buffs from multiple perks for different weapon types, like the meat hook did in the past.
---
My normal experience is Tesla coil damage, even on public servers.  Then again, local connectivity and the wiring of your house plays into it.  If you live in an older home, your connection may suffer based on the way your house is wired.
---
Yes
---
so my tse assault rifle won't be useless anymore
---
No
---
So bloodied gets nerfed, dont quit. Lets be honest guys... youll just be back in a couple weeks/months anyways. I doubt Cyberpunk is as expansive as an Oblivion/Skyrim. I remember seeing strategy guides for Oblivion/Skyrim in stores when they were released and nearly shit my pants seeing how thick they were, was kinda a precurser to how much content and good the games were. Im gunna buy it, but with all this hype around Cyberpunk im fairly certain its gunna be less then what we are expecting.... theres always good ol 76.
---
That’s what I meant lol
---
Too little too late, bloodied should’ve been nerfed as soon as it became a thing
---
LOL I definitely don’t have nuka outfit! But if you wanna play let me know!
---
Also you could remove scrapper and chemist for 2 in nerd rage. Take green thumb off for one more tank killer
---
Wanderer is who I’m talking about
---
Im on xbox n the same thing happened to me I lost a couple good guns an ammo aswell to a glitch in the vendors not cool bathesda
---
I only made this account because my bf told this was useful to make friends for fallout 🥴
---
The companion I’m referring to is the wanderer. I’ve been roaming looking for her lol
---
This season's looking really good.
---
That's the only place I know of. I have never been able to get both resources inside the CAMP circle at once though. And yes the SB is a bit of a nuisance.
---
The overseer wanted gold, that's about it. Everyone else has moved on to caps for currency.
---
Purveyor. That's how I got my bloodied explosive three stars. 
---
I also got some other great combinations. I only kept the mutants 25 25 because it feels good and it allows me to stop being bloodied if I feel like it.
---
I’m really sorry to hear it happened to you, too. Know you’re not alone, and it seems to be across all platforms because I’m on PS4. I guess if we all eventually complain, maybe one day something will happen... right? Probably not, judging by what everyone has said so far.
---
Man I hope that's not something they really plan on doing.
---
I ready get so many stims, radaways etc that I empty the robot vendor and end up dropping the rest of it.. why do they think we need even more of those.
---
Most of us are bloodied builds anyway we have rads for breakfast and die before we can use a stimpack lol.
---
Mild over reaction lol
---
One wasteland is what they’re calling it but yea
---
Anti armor actually benefits slightly from this change, or at least it suffers far less.
---
So instead of multipliers on multipliers all your damage bonuses add up. But anti armor is not a damage bonus, so it still has a multiplying effect.
---
Lets assume you have a 100 damage weapon, nerd rage, adrenal, 3X20 weapon perks, (1.2,1.2,1.2,1.2,1.5)
---
Previously you would be dealing 311 damage with these bonuses, now you will be dealing 230.
---
Adding the 1.8 from bloodied would take the farmer to 560, while armor piercing only gives 1.3(\~at best) for 404
---
but now bloodied is addative, meaning you only go from 230 to 310, while ap is still in effect a multiplier, going to 299, only 11 damage short of bloodied.
---
So yeah, ap is nerfed because everything else is nerfed, but is actually proportionately stronger now on a more optimized build (against enemies with armor)
---
You know, in the World there are a lot of people who don't give a damn about you ... And maybe several of them play FO76 ...
---
Yikes..... Pass
---
Honestly this is for the better as a broad change - multiplicative leads to exponential problems across the board. 
---
Still, I’d rather they 
---
* fix magic weapons
---
* balance lengendary (move berserker to 100%, untuck mutants, move all type-based to 50%, update nocturnal/etc. to not suck as hard)
---
But maybe that’s more complicated to fix
---
Oh dang, I was hoping for more debate on the secret companion theory. I've seen her (and the other companions) at Lost Home numerous times.
---
Eh I don’t really want a “large pool” of weeklies either. Make it weekly, make it concise, but make it somewhat challenging or engaging.
---
Loot belongs to the wind.
---
&gt;pose literally no threat to players with complete builds
---
And we're getting legendary perks added on and won't even have to grind for them, just \*poof\* you're more powerful.
---
No, this is very much a pc problem
---
I guess, depends on your perspective. If you nerf things too hard people won't feel like they're progressing at all.   
---
If they make the damage difference between level 20-50 like 10 then people will ask "what is even the point of leveling up at all? Whats the point of playing?" ya know? 
---
Same with heavily nerfing a playstyle people will ask whats the point of even including that in the game to begin with.  
---
Typically with multiplayer games rather than nerfing developers tend to buff other things so players want to try them instead. **Power creep &gt; power cripple.** 
---
But I guess Bethesda doesn't really follow conventional logic, or much logic at all lmao. 
---
If they did something similar to what they did to unarmed weapons to every weapon in the game I'm sure they'd have troubles lmfao. 
---
There'd be complaints up the ass and people would say "So theres no point in playing unless I get a god roll+minmax huh kinda heavily limiting my freedom guess I'm done playing"
---
What bug?
---
If you are asking if you can hand in more than 1 at a time the answer is no
---
I resent the implication that those of us who are already finished used an exploit (I know you specified “a large portion” rather than all). Do you have facts and figures or other evidence to back up this sweeping generalisation. The only exploit I have ever used is the one where you hand over 150 atoms for a rank up. I pay for fallout 1st and occasionally buy atoms because I like this game, and customising my character and camp is part of that enjoyment, and as an ex World of Warcraft player who would purchase gold tokens from the AH (legitimately via blizzard implemented methods - I never purchased from gold sellers) to buy Armor and weapons I wanted as well as paying £9.99 a month to play the game, I don’t mind doing it in Fallout 76. Having finished and collected all of the rewards I will go back to playing as I did before farming rep and bullion and now scrap for the brotherhood until season 2 comes out when I will do it all again. I just resent the implication that because I am finished I may have used an exploit.
---
&gt;This has happened over and over with no consideration for our time spent. You just have to roll with it and rework your build. Find some new guns. I’m numb to it now.
---
Why should they consider your time spent when you were exploiting an imbalance in the game system that gave you a clear advantage far beyond what others could achieve.  You should be aware by now that updates will happen to address this eventually. Your time wasted is irrelevant to the over all health and balance of the game.  
---
This has been the rules of online games since their release.
---
What bug? Forbidden Knowledge is working if that's what you mean.
---
Ngl this is just garbage, a combat and balance update sure, but really?
---
Another absolutely boneheaded decision by Bethesda, fucking up any fun in the game.
---
Caster until you unlock shotgun
---
Goodammit I was just changing my build from commando to a bloodied unarmed build now it doesn’t even make sense to play this anymore
---
So instead of multipliers on multipliers all your damage bonuses add up. B
---
Lets assume you have a 100 damage weapon, nerd rage, adrenal, 3X20 weapon perks, (1.2,1.5,1.2,1.2,1.2)
---
Adding the 1.8 from bloodied would take the farmer to 560,
---
but now bloodied is additive, meaning you only go from 230 to 310,
---
It still provides the biggest damage bonus, and you can get a lot more damage bonuses by being low health, but the bonuses no longer go absolutely loopy with stacking on top of themselves.
---
Guess i'll die slightly less then. Can't believe you took the time to do the math for a random on the internet.
---
Not that, but whenever I complete the quest if I leave the server and rejoin the quest with pop back up again
---
Again bloodied isn’t nerfed. The way everything stacks is nerfed. All builds. Bloodied commando will still be the best dps
---
What’s atx
---
That’s my actual hope tbh. Shorter amount of total chores, but things that are more engaging, like “Hat Trick - Successfully complete Project Paradise, Encryptid and Scorched Earth” as a weekly, something a bit more fun, and less tedious crap: “scrap power armor” or whatever nonsense.
---
I'm fine with the dailies except for the level up one.  It's difficult to level up after 100 or so.
---
Bethesda, what a bunch of STUPID ASSHOLES.
---
STOP trying to fix the game by ruining things people like. You've nerfed the fuck out of so many things that I'm not sure why anyone really wants to play this piece of shit anymore. I've been running on fumes as once you buy it, it's there. So I can pick it up and chew on it for a bit, but that's about it as it's INCREDIBLY BORING. I pick it up to shoot shit, which is \*distracting) fun for about 15 or 20 minutes. But... Now Bethesda wants to increase the amount of chore this "game" is.
---
What a bunch of FUCKING STUPID ASSHOLES.  Here's the message for you Bethesda, that people have telling you over and over that you DO NOT HEAR:
---
THIS ISN'T A MOBILE GAME, STOP TRYING TO MAKE IT A MOBILE GAME.
---
Fucking assholes.
---
We're getting mannequins?
---
Get ready for some creepy CAMPs going forward.
---
Sounds like a bug everyone would want to have.
---
God I hope they don't go through with this, melee already sucks enough as it is
---
Personally I think this is an improvement from season 1. Only critiscm is that there is like 20 icons. But I like the new structures.
---
Me too!!!! I'm on 60 or 61 right now. You? 
---
I'm pretty sure I can make it to 78, contingent on my work schedule.
---
So it hasn’t happened to anyone else?
---
Wasn't this speculated and 'done' in the past? On PTS that is.
---
More likely they just 'fixed' something again, by breaking 2 more things =/
---
be careful about being vocal about the nerf, some buthurts on the bethy forums are reporting anyone who so much as tries to argue its healthier for the game to be more balanced since the damage scaling being additive instead of multiples, shame people are actually being destructive in their need to keep being broken :/
---
Instigating one shots everything what are you talking about? First year I was a full health build with an instigating shotgun (1*). Had no problem farming. Bloodied is more about the unyeilding armor.
---
Have you actually used a bloodied build?
---
Edit: besides using my shotgun I had a instigating deathclaw gauntlet and farm was cake even with out food/drug buffs.
---
Sounds like an entirely justified nerf to me.
---
Thanks for the answers, all.
---
In the wasteland you take what ever pounding you can

---
 
---
So for everyone talking about a bloodied nerf no bloodied itself was not nerfed. EVERYTHING was nerfed. All of these effects are now an additive multiplier instead of a multiplicative. This makes damage more easily calculated and verifiable, BUT it's a massive nerf to damage output. Let me quickly explain:
---
Bloodied at &lt; 5% health gives 95% more damage.
---
Adrenal reaction at &lt; 20% health gives 50% more damage.
---
Let's say your base damage was 10. Prior to this patch your damage would be calculated (currently just based off these 2 buffs) as 10 \* 1.95 \* 1.5 which would be 29.5 damage. Now with the changes damage is calculated as 10 \* (1.0+0.95+0.5) or 10 \* 2.45 = 24.5 damage. The higher up you go the higher the damage disparity. At 100 damage it's live: 292.5, pts 245. It also seems like this isn't working as it should either as damage numbers seem even less than that.
---
All these effects now use the entry point of "Mod Weapon DMG Modifier Mult" instead of "Mod Weapon Attack Damage".
---
P.S) This affects Perks, Chems, Bobbles, Magazines, Weapon mods, Weapon legendary effects, Food, Drink, and basically anything else you can think of (except the explosive legendary effect funnily enough). 
---
Yeah I suppose I don't want the weapon class as a whole to be nerfed, but I do feel like the maximum damage output from min-maxing needs to be dialed down a bit
---
Min-maxers should be rewarded for sure, but the power gap is rediculous as it stands currently I feel like
---
Yeah whenever I see someone straight up doing it on purpose I head right to the Nuke silo and their camp goes bye byes
---
Ooh, love that ship in a bottle and the Brotherhood bunker.
---
Yes, I’ve actually used a bloodied build. Did not like it. Preference is because of low health, I dislike being at low health. 
---
Yes you’re right, sometimes instigating does one shot, but most times it bugs out for me. Sometimes the first two strikes don’t even register and it takes a while for me to even start chipping at their health.
---
just got a forum warning for telling a guy his broken build was being adjusted for balance sake and i was reported for personally attacking him on the forums while he then replies with "i dont mean to be offensive but... maybe you need a better build" and as all intelligent human being know "i dont mean to offend" is usually followed by something offensive and hoping for a reaction.
---
the more toxic side of the game are showing their faces now that their broken god modes being nerfed.
---
Thank you. This.
---
[I also run a Stealth-Riflemen Build! Here’s what I’m thinking of using](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwMOAwQCDQoBAQEAKOUBBBADpgEDpwEDbAO7AQODAQMYAdUBA9cBAW8DQAXFAQPNAQFCAusBA/ABA8QBA0UDNgIA)
---
You are so lucky to get an Instigsting Explosive rifle (I think fixer?) I’m stuck with a quad cap +33 vat hit chance Fixer
---
They made all robot vendors in game to be inside WS so that is your best bet for mods unless you like hopping vendors all the time
---
it's a everyone problem, it's cross platform meaning pc hackers will ruin everyones experience
---
You do realize the reason they're making the changes is to put all players on an even playing field, right?
---
The only people that ever cry for "Stronger enemies" are people that use over-tuned builds that oneshot enemies that are not meant to be oneshot.
---
They're making the game act the way they intended it would seem.
---
You can get excavator inside WS, it's how i got some of my mods
---
So my strategy is reliant upon mutations. I use marsupial, scaly skin, and speed demon to outrun everything and attack from a distance. I've never been a big fan of armor, but with a combination of the scaly skin mutation and the Chinese stealth suit I have pretty good protection against radiation and can take a few hits before running. That said, I also have been the same gun for over a year now- an instigating explosive pump shotgun. If I enter VATS, I can take most things down at mid range. If you can spec into stealth, or even just use the Chinese stealth suit, it can give you a really good bonus on attacks.
---
its mostly cosmetic stuff anyway   some repair kits and lunch boxes are handy though but meh on the other stuff
---
I know what you mean they really need to fix this bug because I don't put stuff in my vendor because I dont want this to happen again but they really need to look at some ways to fix this but it doesn't even look like they have even attempted.
---
Haha, I cant unsee it now!
---
Yeah I was pretty disappointed when I first got the warehouse set and realised the nice glass pieces werent included. Its only one of many exclusions that make no sense
---
Yay melee weapons are even more shit now thanks so much Bethesda
---
There's always more than a few dopes that can't comprehend how someone could have strong and valid criticisms about something without discounting it entirely. I think that the direction FO76 is going with the player experience is 180 degrees from what it should be, there's no clear reason why shit like dailies should be part of the core gameplay in a game like this. Because of that sort of design decision and how utterly dull it is, I've stopped playing. But I still have a little hope that Bethesda will come around and course correct before these crappy decisions financially ruin a game that clearly has immense potential.
---
Oooh.  I definitely like.
---
I killed Athena too, but have never seen her second coming.   I guess my faith is not as strong as yours.
---
I love the G.I. Joe vibe. Brings me back to my childhood.
---
A buddy of mine has the same bug but he is only other person I know of ...lol this is a bug I wouldn't complain about
---
If you have one stored inside your stash before you could get the quest it’ll bug out and give you one every time you relog into a new server once you can get the quest.
---
Someone on Xbox said they're a mod here and that I'm lying about this
---
Well?
---
Edit: I'm basically saying this guy is a liar.
---
I had the same thing happen once with Ward's daily and since I have a portable power pack in my inventory I was able to complete it over and over again. Eventually the quest didn't start up again, but I got half way through the last reputation level in one day. You should complete Forbidden Knowledge as many times as you can to get the Elder paint in case it stops working like Ward's quest it did for me.
---
It's not taking a shit on players its fixing their broken game since bloodied was too good and allowed you to have weapons like gauss weapons that hit for over 1000 damage, whereas other weapons would barely break 100. This change lifts lesser guns up and gives players more build choices.
---
Also they probably wanted to up the difficulty of the game to be balanced more around working together in a party to take something down.
---
This game is not cross platform multiplayer....
---
Lmao You are woefully misinformed
---
I don’t understand nerds in a predominantly PVE game. This is the same reason I quit Borderlands. I spend tons of time trading and grinding items for my build and rather than buff other builds to keep up the devs nerf everything to equal mediocrity. I’ll likely loose interest and quit again like I did 2 months after release. I don’t want to build something new just to have it be the next target.
---
I'd also suggest maybe look around in the various of community groups that are out there. Great way to meet new people to play with and by doing so you may experience a whole different game again. Finding people to play with sure did help for me quite a while ago and now for the last months I've been playing with this same group of now good friends and we're having a blast every day really.
---
I have a plasma caster and a gauss shotgun. I love both for different reasons. The shotgun can lay down any normal enemy pretty quick. When the SBQ is in the ground it does massive damage to her head. While airborne it does virtually nothing. The plasma caster does a lot more damage while she is airborne and considerable damage while grounded. The biggest difference is the charge of the shotgun will lower your dps.
---
Bugs, the biggest bug for me is that with any Gold Bullion weapons my left arrow will not allow me to switch to a GB weapon. Also sometimes the shotgun forgets it’s charged while you are holding the trigger. Like people have said you can expect collateral damage in close quarters with the shotgun.
---
Sorry, what? I’m pretty sure whoever that was was BSing you.
---
That's just melee combat being bugged with net code issues and not instigating. They should fix issues like that before needing everything across the board.
---
they have said stuff like that before.  you can server hop to get it done  or do it on a private server.  if someone did it recently on your server, it glitches
---
.
---
read above comment, i‘m talking about the daily ops. 
---
i was overflowing with radaway and radx at level 10 already. it‘s not like the forest is some kind of irradiated wasteland. bethesda‘s choices are damn weird.
---
Definitely. And when you pay for Fo 1st, it doesn’t make it appealing to keep AT ALL.
---
Yeah I’ve been there.... basically the Fallout 76 equivalent of Dunwich Borers/Building lol
---
Lol
---
and dont worrt if you dont get the blood sample back it will show up
---
I know that's the point lmao.
---
If he was, he'd know about this post.
---
Uh... Am I the only one that immediately thought that looked remarkably like what the mole men are wearing?
---
I will use scrap kits.
---
I’m full up on repair kits from queen / encryptid. Wish I could drop them for other players.
---
I think there's a number of people that work long hours but have enough disposable income to buy atoms to get more enjoyment out of the hobby they find time for. No shame, no judgment. 
---
Also. We all spend our money on something we "shouldn't".
---
The Kovac-Muldoon. An amazing piece of machinery but a...poor conversationalist. It is our...little Enclave’s...ace in the hole.
---
Problem is when they add some new challenges whole Reddit is on fire. So its like double edged sword.
---
Just play in your own pace like me, I will or not complete daily doesn't matter. I skipped every NW and around 10 days. And I'm 1 hop before Zorbo.
---
Most of these dailies autocomplete when I do quests, farm mats or just explore.
---
It isn’t out on the pts yet lol
---
👍
---
I’m sure the noise it makes will be next level too
---
I wonder if players will try to make rustic houses with the new greenhouse walls
---
You can see Enclave APA Mk2 "horns" protruding from behind the jetpack image. It's definitely the Enclave jetpack for that armor that's been lying around in the files for ages.
---
Also hate that armor and cosmetic clothing have the same tab in that way, can't blame a new player for not knowing what is what but its a bit frustrating to find 5 broken hazmat suits and tons of other random and quite useless clothing, if you are looking around for actual armor.
---
Like, there’s this scary pandemic outside.
---
This isn’t a game. This is prep.
---
If they considered the time spent then they wouldn't be allowed to properly balance their game so more build types are viable. This pushes down bloodied but makes all other weapons and builds more viable. It's also no fun having players one shot everything. More challenge is welcome they want to have incentive for working together more.
---
Haha dont get me started on Fo 1st jesus lol😂
---
Lots of things to be pleased about in that lot. Not seeing anyone comment on those weapon racks. Im actually pretty keen for those. They look much nice than the plain peg boards, although they have their uses too. Hopefully they wont be shoved in a bundle of ridiculous shit I dont want but we'll see
---
Yeah I understand. I’m sure I hurt some peoples feelings by not liking bloodied, but everybody has their preferences. 
---
I run vanguard with all armor perks WO PA, with either AA or Instigating weapons with faster swing speed. Unyielding is just such a grind to get a full set. Takes a while. I like being at full health and being able to tank a lot of shit without breaking a lot of my armor or weapons. 
---
Bloodied was fun, I’ll admit but I was dying so much lol.
---
I use to fill up the icebox at the golf club because I just didn't need anymore legendary gear. Miss the old days.
---
Wow! Good move devs! Giving people what they want!
---
Kinda glad because game wasn't challenging and w shottting enemies was terrible design.
---
np m8
---
Did you compensate for the arrow arch?
---
Finally some meaningful balance changes, I was afraid that the TSE nerf would be the last one.
---
HAHAHAHA what are they, a dog? Trained by the little rewardong *ding* when you finish a challenge
---
I been waiting on that sucker for months ..I have 4 or 5 I need the crock and the sheepsquatch one
---
The only ones who complain about bloodied, are the mard arses,who couldn't be bothered optimisizng their own in game build.Or simply dont want to put the hours in.
---
I have nearly 400 levels in this game every weapon in my Stash is bloodied.
---
Full unyielding Armour set took me an eternity to grind.
---
We run on nearly zero health to do maximum damage.
---
I can drop a Queen in seconds but get killed by a hatchling.
---
You take away the rewards for running with no life you will literally kill the build.
---
Very well said
---
I LOVE THAT ONE! But IMO there are a few good ones. There are maybe 10 that I really liked
---
And considering that when i load in I have to sort my inventory then yeah it becomes a pain.
---
I deleted it, I will drink on their tears when its nerfed
---
I'm actually more stoked that the greenhouse is in pieces. That means full-size windows on regular buildings! Skylights!
---
Why? Doing dailies and weeklies got me to 91 so far
---
My enjoyment of the game was broken since I started playing with those those bloodies and melee guys 1shotting everything.
---
I had the same bug with Ward. Unfortunately Id already maxed out rep with Settlers. It was still nice for the T Notes
---
Thanks for another post where someone tells us how we have to play for their sake.
---
And I don’t even sell the mounted head plans because they are so over common.
---
I recently started a new character just to see how the initial 35-40 lvl character with imperfect build was different from 300 lvl  Bloodied\\ Junkies build.  And this game has become a complete routine. You have to shoot tons of bullets at enemies before they die. And these are not some "unique enemies". These are the good old super mutants and ghouls. Combat is tedious long and boring.  And in past games it was not as noticeable as here. Maybe because you didn't need to clear the same location every day to get XP.  
---
They don't improve on previous builds, they just nerf damage your character can do, that's all. Even more, I don't see any point grinding for the future good weapons and gear. Because they just going to nerf it in the end.
---
I found her walking the road just north of the Nuka Cola plant.  Don’t put her in the Grognak outfit either, girl needs a shower bad!
---
So you spend all this time to level up, then the update drops you get all 6 perks and if you don't wanna level them up then you're done, kinda defeats the purpose don't ya think
---
Please god no. I’ll admit as a bloodied build bloodied weapons def need nerfs but not 60 fucking percent.
---
I too really want casinos and there are casinos in wv hesr commercials on the radio for it all the time so it would totally fit in
---
It’s additive rather then multiplicative now. That’s why bloodied and melee were hit the most damage wise. Str and int were multiplicative per point  before.
---
Pretty sure exp boosts got hit as well.
---
This is good. Balances builds more. They need to bring explosive weapons up to par. People should be mini nuking the SBQ.
---
Fuck, they put the Communist armor in the score season 2. Disregard everything I said. I owe my soul to Bethesda I guess.
---
&gt;What's with all the Spade symbols? Does it mean something
---
Yes, it means it's BBC only.
---
Worrh it for people like you wasting caps fast traveling
---
Nail in the coffin.
---
Bah, I see a nice long post of new features to the PTS, and it's not even live yet. 🙄
---
Maybe those are just placeholders time keep some of the new season a surprise
---
I run explosive weapons with grenadier. It doubles the blast radius and I just shoot the ground around enemies. Or the wade in and bash melee player that always shows up (with pacifist on of course)
---
Not all of us wear dresses, and cow fur suits
---
its not that its bloodied personally its that one build should not be able to single handedly be the only option because it can do everything better than several seperate builds at once.
---
for instance bloodied tanked better than a full vanguard/sentinel setup, healed better than a medic setup since you cant heal what cant be damage and it did more damage than ACTUAL glass cannon builds like berzerkers.
---
if it was genuinely a glass cannon i'd be fine with it but it wasn't, it was more like a titanium ion cannon
---
Yeah good point. Blooded builds will probably still be the best. Except maybe TSE ones
---
Pretty sure it is. Grinded for it when wastelander came ouy.
---
Probably this. I’m sure they’re like to keep somethings back so they can announce it
---
What’s the change?
---
same thing happened to.me   i was at the purveyor and it auto completed because someone launched a nuke.   you can still run a nuke silo and the quest with markers will show up everytime telling you where to go.   just dont be an idiot like me and do it monday night at 9 pm ct having the nuke codes change 3 hours before and your one and only nuke card get eaten by the machine.
---
Daaaaamn! So much to be stoked on. The classic BOS bunker, greenhouse walls, commie paints aquirable outside of spending capital, and finally power armor and clothing displays! I know what I'm saving my atoms for.
---
Oh I get it. Are Bloodied and Junkies the only two getting affected?
---
No I have server hopped a lot it’s still gone
---
I wish we got more perk cards for energy weapons like boosted plasma damage or laser rifle. AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE LET THE PLASMA FLAMER USE PLASMA CORES INSTEAD OF CARTRIDGES IT DOENST MAKE SENSE!!!
---
I'm really sorry that happened. It's gut wrenching.
---
Fair enough 👍🏻
---
Couldn’t have said it better myself. The game gets really boring after a while to the point where killing things is the only fun thing to do and now they’re making that nearly as fun.
---
This helmet with a clean suit, might make for a decent Dieselpunk style
---
What build do you run then?
---
I really appreciate it. It’s a bummer. 
---
I canceled my Fo1st, and just going to keep on rolling, you know how it goes :)
---
Here’s my stealth rifleman build. Nothing too fancy. 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=4f34a9b&amp;d=sb1s01pd2pk2p62pp2pl2eo2c72ib4ic4ar2an2ao0a51l71li2lt2lu2
---
ps just go to the nukacrypt site to get the weekly nuke codes since u went through the hassle of decoding the nuke codes already
---
Fuck yeah! With hookers! And booze!
---
Same problem for me too! Some BS
---
You say no thanks, then please leave the game, I personally don't want to be playing with ppl that just complain and whine to no regard and half the time doesn't make sense its just that they want everything handed to them. That's the other thing if you complain and whine and non stop talk shit, it can't be fun to play so why do those ppl play
---
Figuring out how the game works and taking advantage of it is not exploiting IMO - I get into the math and how to maximize damage, how perks synergize with each other etc - that’s all
---
took one guy 3 hops.  another 20 minutes of server hops.   are you on ps4?
---
Finally, my CAMP will have guards. Mannequin guards, but guards none the less.
---
That’s a pretty fair question? Why were you downvoted lol??
---
I refuse at this point.  I have a life and other hobbies.
---
I don't know, I'd kind of like if many more builds are viable. They should fix things that are broken.
---
good, now balance the rest of the game
---
He would be 30 as he was born in 2072 and fallout 76 is 2102. He was originally on the west cost from vault 29 but traveled to DC by 2207 for fallout 3. He fell into FEV sometime before fallout 1 begins in 2161. Before that he was a caravan master in the earlier years of the hub. He could be a traveling trader npc like Grahm. 
---
(Feel free to correct me, I might have remembered years wrong)
---
EDIT: he became a trader in 2090, he was exposed to the FEV sometime between June 23rd 2102 (date he and  Richard Grey broke into Mariposa Military Base) -  June 27th 2102 (when he was found by traders and taken back to the hub) actual date is unconfirmed within these timelines. 
---
He left the hub in 2162 and arrived in Gecko in 2238. 
---
After the in between 2162 and 2238 it is known he traveled as far west as Texas before the events of fallout 3. 
---
Before that he traveled through New California only. 
---
So no, it's a lore break sadly. :(
---
Nope got both mine without knowing any plans because I was too tight to pay for it
---
I always tell people that bloodied Unyielding means hardly ever dying. Low HP is irrelevant when you avoid or tank all attacks. 
---
My vanguard dies more often than my Unyielding.
---
There’s a bridge in Point Pleasant leading out of Appalachia
---
Hey, would you be able to do a TS or TSE damage comparison. I'd think it would be extremely similar damage but I'm just curious.
---
Who knows, I stopped questioning downvotes
---
Not my pic, and I’m unable to currently...
---
That being said, others have and they said TS/TSE is now better.
---
I could be wrong as I’m a pretty basic rifleman/melee full health build, but I feel confident that anything similar, won’t be hit as hard since it’s not dependent on 8 different multiplayers to be top tier (not that it is but keeps me alive at least)
---
1, everything is the same but you'll be alone (or with your friends)
---
2, not quite sure what you mean by that, but I refer to #1
---
3, if a friend who also has FO1ST is in the server it will remain active until the last person with FO1ST leaves the server, then there will be a timer and then the non FO1ST people will be kicked off. Note that you can not join the world if the original owner is not in it.
---
Also, if you plan on transferring items or so, 1, use public containers, do not drop things, 2, to be extra save ask a friend to keep the world 'online' while you switch. (There have been unlucky cases where the worlfs just reset or refreshed when people switched charatcters resulting in a loss of deposited items. They do stay active for a while when you are out if it though)
---
Yup that’s reddit. 
---
Well I still don’t know what was changed either lol
---
So you think people will flock to use an obvious glitch once their imbalanced build is reduced to slightly better than the others?
---
Perhaps, but the glitch will get patched and the tears will flow anew.
---
Lol it’s not tho
---
why even waste your precious time on replying to the post?
---
I'd suggest Concentrated Fire instead of Ground Pounder.
---
I only grind events these days for T Bonds.
---
I see it from both sides.
---
Some players want to play how they want.Fair enough.There is no law says they cant.
---
Others think there should be a common in game courtesy with Legenderies,which credit to Fallout 76 player Base mostly there is..
---
Personally i think the ones that one shot Legenderies,get a kick out of triggering the in game "Karens".Who will spend the rest of the event,following them around, throwing thumbs down/vomit emojis.
---
Umm I searched that and yea, you are right. I had friends that mentioned controls keybinds, I assumed it was crossplay, they must just use controllers on their pcs.
---
I could be wrong so don’t put me on blast like you guys always do but I think it was a drop for the mole minor lunch pales. ?? Not sure if it’s in the atomic shop. I know it is a plan you can trade for.
---
It came to my attention that it is the plushie and not the back pack. In that case it is an atomic shop mate. Not sure when they will release it again.  Good luck. 
---
I love that plushie and it looks good on the bed.
---
Sept 10
---
What a weird, stupid reply.
---
Oh I get it. Your one of those “players” that spends more time playing the game market then actually the game. How much real money do you make of this game?
---
Same for the OP.
---
Here’s an upvote for you. Don’t see why a question would be downvoted. Lol. I’d like to see more about the change and why.
---
Minmaxers are always going to be stronger than the average player it kinda can't be helped. They will take advantage of the benefits developers made to help new players while avoiding the pitfalls they put in for higher level players. 
---
The gap though was and always has been created by Bethesda's balancing it is never the player's fault for playing the game in a certain way that was intended by Bethesda. 
---
If they want to close that gap rather than having invisible numbers/factors that minmaxers will eventually discover and exploit they need to make things more transparent/simpler. 
---
This unarmed nerf won't effect 99.9% of minmaxers but casuals will most likely hate it immensely.
---
I drop all my extra plans/ low level PA parts and junk mods into the intersection at the Wayward
---
This is an mmo. Keeping players engaged long term is the point. ESO is the same.
---
I don’t run any bloodied builds but I just want to know how much this will effect full health builds
---
Don’t shoot the queen in the air and get off of your damn tent!
---
Heres the explanation https://bethesda.net/community/topic/423746/all-damage-modifiers-were-nerfed-not-just-bloodied-explanation-inside?language%2525255B%2525255D=en&amp;language%25255B%25255D=en&amp;language%5B%5D=en
---
If the icons replaced Scrap kits I'd say that is a plus. Utterly useless 'reward'
---
You say it doesn't make sense that someone would rather talk about doing the thing they enjoy rather than just doing it
---
Not that it matters much. But are you on regular or PS4 pro?
---
Server hop to complete the quest   don't server hop looking for the blood sample again cuz you won't get it. But it'll show up when you find the right server.
---
as someone who used bloodied for a short term i can definitely agree thats the case, its fun for a short while but the novelty of being god mode wears off within a week at most and the only times i would actually die is due to carelessness.
---
I’m actually ok with health kits, I burn through stims as melee tank.
---
Thanks, it’s like Titaniux said “that’s just reddit”
---
Hopefully the change doesn’t hit non-bloodied builds too hard
---
Yeah same. Never ran Bloodied. 
---
But the game really could use some difficulty again. Just hoping they listen to the players on pts
---
Good thought!
---
Odd. Never heard of this one. Am on pc though
---
I didn’t think I would see u here
---
“Griefer bad, am I right”
---
I do unfortunately. I cancelled 1st recently for similar reasons.
---
But I will finish this damn legendary run. 😂
---
My build is entirely bloodied so it’s pretty discouraging.
---
Delicious, finally a good fucking mask.
---
if the Toaster Vendor isn’t a maniacal raging talking Toaster then there’s no point to it
---
It's Tragic: the Garnering, then.
---
I mean, the shop would still be linked to reputation, so people wouldn’t be able to buy stuff right away. Same with the other factions.
---
Good!
---
That’s exactly what I tried to write but my brain is to smooth so I gave up
---
That’s sus
---
Can confirm, I saw a massive decrease in paper and in game damage on my bloodied rifleman.  I can casually bodyshot lvl 68 super mutants with my be lever live, and that same character now takes 2 headshots to kill a similar level supermutant.
---
I also noticed a noticeable decrease in damage on my junkies character though not as dramatic.  paper damage on jffr handmade with 50% damage boost from perks and 5 addictions ent from \~120 to \~100.  ttk seems about the same though so I have to wonder if maybe enemies are less tanky now with the "one wasteland" update.  
---
But yeah I'm just glad I only have 1 bloody character :P
---
I’ve wanted greenhouse walls and ceilings for SOOO long!! ❤️❤️
---
What’s your Free States reputation?
---
Guess we wait and see if beth adjusts the numbers back or not now
---
If you do Sweetwater’s daily he’ll send you to collect honey. He needs ten, you get more than that.
---
Damn. I went afk when couple low levels were staring at my vendors, but I haven't checked my vendors after that... 
---
Is this somehow related to pvp? Since I'm always in pacifist mode - does this means I'm safe? 
---
Do they can take items from the stash? 
---
How to protect yourself - just turn off vendors and hide them?
---
Looks like a steampunk ranger helmet
---
Ok. I’ll buy all your weapons for caps then if they’re worthless
---
Great. A big damage nerf to all weapons is going to lead to a major ammo crisis. It’ll take more bullets to kill everything so lead, gunpowder, and steel will be much less common as people will take it. People who sell ammo probably will sell it for several times the normal amount. And we can’t just switch to melee weapons and have everything be ok. Why? Because melee weapons are hit the hardest!
---
Helvetia around one of the shacks out back.
---
The question really is why?  My guess would be to fix the David blaine "Magic" weapons
---
Where the little rocket ship is
---
Do Monster Mash every time you see it. I’m usually the only one there, ghoul after ghoul to mow down. Yesterday I leveled up twice in one event and got five legendaries for my trouble.
---
I'm so excited! Do they have airships like the prydwen at this point in the lore or are they walking lol
---
RISE TSE Handmade club!
---
High endurance stealth bloodied build with high agility and decent luck. Run born survivor or autostim armor. Bolstering armor or sentinel armor. Sentinel armor with dodgy, born survivor, Ricochet, serendipity, flame proof perk, lifegiver, adamntium skeleton, blocker. Use only super stimz. That's suuuuper tanky at low health
---
That’s a strange and unnecessary judgement call. How do you know when they made this?
---
i cant test it but this type of chamge will make balance changes much much easier for sure.
---
bloodied will still be the best build wont it?
---
The event Irrational Fear is north of Raeligh Clay's Bunker near the pylon, if it's not up you can still go there to collect quite a bit of honey. If you want it for AP reasons sugar is a lot easier to make.
---
Might be an unpopular take, but I am around rank 80 by doing all the dailies and weeklies and some grinding of XP for the repeatable SCORE challenge (didn't do any of the Nuclear Winter ones) and even I'm not sure I'm going to make it to 100 by the end of the season. Especially with ranks requiring more and more SCORE points to get next rank (requires more than 3000 SCORE past rank 80). Feels like a lot more work than the 1-2 hours per rank estimation as per Bethesda's Seasons FAQ.
---
With three weeks left of the Legendary Run, I'm not that confident I'll make it at this rate. I know some people here have already hit rank 100, but I don't know how much they play, how they play (I guess high intelligence and efficient XP farming runs to get all that XP SCORE), and how hard they play (I barely get 20k XP per two hour session just to level up and its really not that fun). With only 70 days from start to finish of the season, I just can't see how anyone can casually play and get to rank 100 with the way the daily/weekly challenges are set up, let alone with the numerous auto-finish bugs people are encountering. 
---
This Legendary Run definitely made me question whether or not I really want to do this again next season, since it definitely requires an every day commitment that would be pretty hard to maintain. I think it's better that you just aim for the reward you really, really want, but it's better to play at the rate you want and have fun rather than feel like this is work (like how I'm feeling about it now). 
---
I'm not sure if others feel pretty confident they will be done by Sept 8th, or if they are like me and feel uncertain. This may be the only game with a Season Pass that makes me feel like I need to play way more than 2 hours a day if I want a 'shot' at finishing the season; max rank is not guaranteed even if we do all the daily/weekly challenges. Even though some people will say, 'well it was free and you didn't pay for it,' something about it just doesn't feel right.
---
So far, never. It was a possible reward from the mile miner event, and the plans for one we’re going for around 10k caps back when the event was live. It’ll likely be reward again for the next time the event comes around, and maybe even for Christmas.
---
Even if they do "play 30 min a day" and nothing else, some people will complain that they can't do it, or not everyday, i mean, that's on the player, not the game. I have a trip soon and i will not be able to play for a week, is not Bethesda's problem lol. I just want them to fix bugs!
---
Already am!  Couldn't find a half decent bloodied to save my life
---
I’ve been tempted to make a bloodied gauss pistol build but I don’t feel like building a third character. With this nerf I just hope it bridges the gap between builds since I think the only other build close to Bloodied is a Junkies build, and personally I don’t like either
---
Oh I didn’t realize it’s a plan
---
Max 😎
---
Standard “no chat” greeting in multiplayer. Basically a light version of saying hello.
---
That wouldn't be fun. Even though when i am helping newbies this is what i do to help get them some credit.
---
I think op is talking about the camp item and not the backpack skin. At least that’s how I read it lol
---
Can confirm that NOTHING is working for me, Xbox player! This is ridiculous
---
Hopefully they don’t get hit too hard but with how much better they are compared to just about every other build I’m not surprised it’s getting toned down
---
My camp is built on the course and I'd rather not have a broken window from you wastelanders
---
This game has been going downhill since Wastelanders.
---
I love, "I miss my momma..." as I sneak up on them.
---
This is worth grinding for. The working flashlight is a major cherry on top. Looks cool, but is unique enough to create some snazzy outfits and costumes.
---
I may have fudged the math on anti armor a little bit for simplicity sake, the 299 is a bit over simplifying, it's actually 230 with enemy armor efficiency of 460 damage, which is slightly less than 299, but 299 damage with no ap should be comparable against enemies with 300ish armor. (100 base damage weapon, 150 armor for a 50 base damage weapon)
---
On the road to grafton from Morgantown junk yard, north of the mechanics shop, there are several hives under the overpass.
---
*Gwiefor bad am I wight*
---
Yes I know so weird to find a gta griefer play another game
---
I might give away all my bloodied godrolls and keep my instigating revolver, nothing else. 
---
Refreshing, really.
---
So you're telling me I can't play through.
---
The pts just opened up on pc we won't get the patch until like mid September. What's coming next week is just the colossus problem event and meat week next weekend.
---
Isn’t op referring to the camp item and not the backpack?
---
Or was there a crocodile plushie to place in camp in the mole event also?
---
They will mist likely be nerfed with the coming of one appalacia, which is not this tuesday. They are safe for now.
---
In fact, forget the casino!
---
#VERY
---
this really sums up my feelings atm too. Im a father so finding time to play is already difficult and i wasn't expecting to get to the very end but this feels like if i want to get any where on it i need to stop doing anything else and just do dailies and weeklies. I gotta say that its boring as fuck
---
 The presence of **chlorophyll** in a **potato** means that a glycoalkaloid poison named solanine is also present. A defense against insects, this nerve toxin (which is in the nightshade family) can result in headaches, vomiting, diarrhea, and even paralysis if ingested in very high amounts. 
---
So insulted him, and you tried to poison him!
---
You won’t be hit to much 
---
For example a handmade with a base dmg of 45 will now do 72 instead of 77.76 with 3 max perkcards. 
---
But if you use a psychobuff the 25% will be counted towards the base damage of 45 instead of being toward the currents damage the gun has
---
The changes come with patch 22 which is said to be going live in mid/late septmeber, it will likely be later than that or like patch 21 only part of it will be introduced then.
---
What would you do if you didn't have dailies?
---
Yeah but new Vegas was made by a far superior developer ;)
---
When you know that one set up has a clear and over whelming advantage and you utilize that to the max that is exploiting the game logic.  It is a subtle but important difference.  And when you reach the point you can solo a boss designed with a build in 70% damage reduction designed to take on large numbers of players in only a few minutes that has gone to the exploiting game logic level.
---
Remind me, the 33% VATS hit chance makes most weapons magic, right? Because I'll be using a two shot magic .50 cal
---
Interesting.
---
If that's intentional, then I guess it would be more beneficial to have a few BIG bonuses versus a bunch of small ones like currently.
---
In one way, it keeps different weapons in a tighter range, so there isn't SUCH a big gap.
---
But on the other hand, they might need to almost DOUBLE the base damage of all weapons to keep up with how BEEFY enemies in One Wasteland will be.
---
Nothing looks better than full Unyielding leather. Not heavy: sturdy. Fantastic appearance.
---
The farm north in the Forest where you get cranberries, Aaronholt** Homestead I believe it's called.
---
There's a little wooden hut with about 10 hives.
---
Nah they’ve worked on mobile games before clearly. Or else 76 wouldn’t be so similar to it
---
I hear you. Also really wanted to make a pistol build. But nah imma stick to my main. 
---
I just hope that all builds will be playable and they will each have their own pros and cons. 
---
The meta is too strong imo. There shouldn’t be such a huge gap between the meta and the next best build. At least that’s my opinion
---
Just saying people still buying my mounted plans to this day , sorry if you think every player has mounted plans but it's just not true new players will come and they will see these mounted plans and just buy them so easily i say keep selling mounted plans to players or be so kind to just drop it for someone
---
I hate to burst the bubble, but be aware that currently, literally EVERYTHING in the PTS has been nerfed to the point Bloodied melee does 1/3 its original damage. Junkies took a 30-40% hit and nearly every prefix is affected. Melee has been hit the hardest but this is about pistols. We now have anti armor effects, but we just took a huge knock against damage output for everything across the board
---
Take it easy on the bandwagon, you might fall off.
---
New to game what does TSE mean?
---
Seems like a good direction for the game.
---
No one playing bloodied will care, they’ll just bitch and moan and cry. Get ready for the countless “Bethesda you’ve gone to far I’m  quitting” posts.
---
Oh dear, more Chinese stuff.... Just when I thought I could finally take a little break.
---
If you have a non legendary weapon and just use perks you are effected.
---
so if you take the 1 star damage perks for your weapon (10%,10%,10%), your damage bonus drops from 33% to 30%, 3 stars version goes from 73% to 60%.
---
Everything is hit, but things that stacked a lot of different bonuses are hit harder.
---
Junkies, bloodied, stealth, and melee are hardest hit because they had ridiculous numbers of bonuses stacking.
---
But do I grief in this game? No too much work into a build/weapons/armor/aid 
---
What do I enjoy? Building, collecting plans/rare outfits, and grinding for new weapons to sell and profit
---
More often than the rideable buttercup I've been waiting for...   
---
I think it was last March maybe early April that the plushie was in the shop.
---
Lelelele
---
if this goes through it wont matter because bloodied will still be the best legendary effect for raw damage output
---
Those days were awesome. Go trade and scrap stuff inside, then go back outside because someone got the glowing ones to respawn
---
Only unique weapons that are hidden behind a quest like the fixer will need a plan to start unlocking the legendaries. 
---
So no. Not for the .50 cal. 
---
Hope you get one soon!
---
cannot believe they're nerfing bloodied
---
How about a game of gwent to pass the time.
---
So you don’t have any technical data on you?
---
yes
---
That’s not how they will see it.
---
Wait what about TSE weapons? Won’t they be as good as if not better than Bloodied weapons?
---
&gt; A big damage nerf to all weapons is going to lead to a major ammo  crisis. It’ll take more bullets to kill everything so lead, gunpowder,  and steel will be much less common as people will take it. 
---
I think you are over exaggerating on this here.  It doesn't take a lot of bullets to kill things as it is.  Scrapper perk can get a ton of steal out of a lot of events with a lot of weapon using mobs and lead can be mined in large quantities.
---
But u can’t grief in this game, other than nuking someone’s camp. Do u play nuke winter?
---
Good thing I didn't go bloodied, and have all my tse weapons still.  I got a bunch of them.  I am glad they balanced things, placing me back on top.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Hmm, somebody is jealous of all my tse weapons apparently, and that I am better than them now...
---
Just shoot her, that's a permanent solution, oh and don't forget to loot her after
---
Sorry dude, I have to downvote. It is not high risk. I have 2300 hours in, played all builds, and bloodied is a powerhouse. You avoid or tank hits, fights are short because of your damage output and only die if you do something stupid like dropping from a cliff. 
---
I agree the magic shotguns and melting miniguns need to be fixed, though. A shotgun with no perks hits heavier than a rifleman with all perks.
---
.... I feel you, but there has always been a weird juxtaposition between posts like this and ones complaining about the 1* rolling pins and the scrip/gold/cap limits.  
---
"Ugh, another rolling pin for the pile..."
---
"Ugh!!! That could have been another rolling pin for the pile!"
---
Just another question. How do you change the skin on the CAMP?
---
I haven’t figured it out yet. Same with tents
---
Don't mind it. Game is just too easy as it is. No challenge.
---
One thing that drives me insane about these these counter-complaint complaints is that they tend to be centered on shaming the user for their behavior instead of focusing on the medium and its design problems. I am level 53 in the season and I have purposefully NOT been looking at the challenges (I bought a few levels here and there when I was close to a milestone like the raider tree or when the next reward was 150 atoms). I likely will not complete the run and get the end rewards because I refuse to gather wood and deal with dumb objectives. You know what a good weekly challenge is? Discover 5 new locations, Blackout on Nukashine 5 times, Freeze the queen using a grenade/cryolator. You know actual gameplay mechanics that would likely expose you to things you never thought to do on your own. You know what is shitty and un-fun? Gathering 100 wood or "break down materials to make X", or capturing and building up a workshop 5 times by following their crappy cut and paste design spec that requires a dresser/shelves/stairs etc. THAT is what the complaints are centered around. If the score grind was the same or you earned score 1:1 with XP and the challenges had some substance, nobody would be bitching. But here we are because they designed it to be boring because they dont want people no-lifing (Which is insane to me because gaming for hours a day is becoming very very normal and only benefits the game and their bottom line). 
---
"Nobody is forcing you to play the game for hours and hours a day", except when you look at the math for some of the item drop rates or obtainable goals (like max rep for ammo converter), the math works out to a serious grind for just about anyone who wants to focus on this game specifically or on specific obtainable goals. There is a huge market for casuals, ask anyone familiar with EA games. BUT they play all games the same and its akin to a flavor of the month "whats new" mentality and that leads me to questions like "Why would you gate X reward that a dedicated player really likes/wants behind a 0.001% drop rate?" Why punish investment? This behavior should be encouraged. You want people spending as much time thinking breathing and fucking dreaming about your game but to feel fulfilled while they do. The opposite and problematic experience I see and even feel myself sometimes is "Fuck this thing only spawns in green footlockers 0.03% of the time so I guess the next six hours (well into the night when I should be sleeping before work the next day, dont judge me) is spent on a stupid fucking server hopping spree checking footlockers for a clean mr handy fuel. For some asshole reason human psychology is like a badly run business. The actual values/practice don't matter as long as you follow predatory marketing practice and work on peoples subconscious lizard brains and never budge and it works well until it doesn't and everything collapses which is why mobile games are top of the world in every market for 3 months and then fucking disappear never to be heard from again. The games that succeed for 20 years later (like wow classic for a good example) have solid and fun core design with monetization done smoothly. The way the atom shop/1st/and now score work are blatant and unfun. 
---
If you think about it, its counter-intuitive. If you increase the reward for time invested proportionally you create loyal long-term players en mass who invest accordingly both in atoms and other mechanics/characters and enjoy their treasure trove of obtained loot. They tried to do this with fear of missing out in the atom shop and in some ways it works well because people flocked to the thanksgiving displays like crack addicts to a drug dealer. You want that as a side dish, not for EVERYTHING. 
---
Most of the toxically positive people literally come up with excuses on Bethesda's behalf for why this game is not more massively popular. I have heard some dumbass reasoning like "Oh its because Fallout is niche and shooter/rpgs/mmo fusion games are just not hot right now" and its hilarious. Guild Wars 2/Runescape/Wow would like a word. The reason the game is not more massively popular is in order: Lack of content, bugs, too much grind. In my opinion this is what creates players like me who generally stick around through the storms (Except when they disabled vending I had to break cause it was such a core part of my experience). The rest turns into what equals a badly run company with high turnover. You can attract new employees with the flashy marketing like gamepass for example, but anyone that spends a couple weeks in your environment quickly gets burned out but that doesn't matter because theres another batch of demographics that will take you up on your offer and the cycle continues. If you bring it up to management they go "Well profits have never been higher, how could this be a problem!?" even as their most loyal workers pack up and go home never to return and then eventually shit falls apart and the big brains are left wondering what happened exclaiming "we did everything right" riding their golden parachutes to their mansions. Its not good game design. The content is not centered around fun and worrying about monetization after. Its literally designed at its core to waste time with nothing while offering very little in return except for the weird people like me who persist through the burnout and have a lot of nice shit to show for it. That is without factoring in that the majority of the bugs are serious and game-breaking for a lot of people in big ways. 
---
The end goal is entertainment and satisfaction. Majority numbers being satisfied is good. Pigeonholing players into a time-gated and otherwise limited experience specifically at a transparent attempt to have their cake at eat it too, is the problem. I am an MMO veteran I've played Guild Wars, Wow, Runescape, Rift, etc and the list goes on. Some of them for Thousands of hours. They all have grind and I have come to accept its a part of the genre and some of them handle it exceedingly well like Guild Wars 2. That being said, the reason you see so many complaints is not because everyone is a closeted nerd nolifer its because the systems in place are badly designed and its affecting enough people that the majority that participate in communities like this feel a need to validate their feelings. The ones who dont just stop playing and fade away as quickly as they started. Nothing is designed around the highest quality player experience (score/legendary perks/the queen fight etc the list goes on). They are designed from a top down, scheduled, technical and mathematical breakdown which is where the "devs dont play" thing comes from. 
---
Just my two cents.
---
Fallout Fore
---
[](/filthysmile)I usually only hit caps limit when I have first(since my stash no longer has to accommodate junk for a while, so I have space for vending), so I use those proceeds to buy bulk junk from vendors to float me til the next time I re up for first.  
---
  
---
I suppose that isn't too fun sounding is it?
---
Don’t work for COVID, don’t work for the wasteland
---
Your anger is misguided. Bethesda designed it.
---
Grief/PvP I mean there are ways to initiate pvp *(if they're not in pacifists mode)* in this broken game
---
Yes I do currently at rank 44 which unlocked the pink sprinkle pa which I **TOTALLY LOVE**
---
&gt; I don’t understand nerds in a predominantly PVE game.  
---
Because it is an online game that has other players in it.
---
&gt; I spend tons of time trading and grinding items for my build and rather  than buff other builds to keep up the devs nerf everything to equal  mediocrity. 
---
So in other words you exploited game play logic and got upset that they balanced everything and closed that loop hole.
---
Seriously, that’s a big gripe of mine. I wanna have fun but some builds are so strong that if they see the legendary first then there’s little chance you’ll actually get any damage on them and that kills events
---
Travel along the whole west coast. 
---
From north to south. 
---
I haven’t seen it not working yet. Almost guaranteed spawn along the way.
---
Okay that doesn’t sound too bad
---
AD VICTORIAM, BROTHER
---
Have to do a certain amount of dmg
---
Is the thing that looks like a steal plate the underground bunker?
---
Thanks for posting this link :)
---
You have to cause 1000+ worth of damage.
---
It's not exploitative if it's literally the balancing mechanics. An exploit involves using something other than how it was intended. Like magic weapons. I understand what you're saying, and the balance should have been a buff to other builds, not a nerf to everything, but we'll see how it turns out.
---
Would be better for them to just remove clipping restrictions for everything!
---
How did I exploit the game? I just said I grinded and traded for the gameplay experience I wanted. Bloodied isn’t the PVP meta so what I play doesn’t effect anyone else.
---
More pellets.
---
With the excavator PA you can go to Lucky Hole Mine and farm lead. The Excavator can mine 4 times the ore you can get with your bare hands.
---
I just wish that they would add a new map to nuclear winter.
---
Not the SBQ, look to the Fallout 4 nod that turns SentryBots into Thomas!
---
Exactly. 
---
I really just started doing everything in private servers. 
---
There’s just too many people that are afraid not getting a hit on the legendaries. So they usually just melt them right away. 
---
I never do line in the sand anymore because of the spawn glitch. And there’s always that/those guy(s) with a bloodied build killing everything. Really not fun at all.
---
Two-shot Explosive. The OG god-tier gun.
---
Mind power Steve, mind power...
---
Ima leave u with this, Mothman is the worstest cryptid
---
:0
---
^/s
---
Ah the good old "have to sort my stuff, don’t mind me for the next 30 min" lol. 
---
I prefer to do it at the end of my game session: repairing weapons, sorting and selling things, converting and crafting ammo and chems. 
---
But yeah it is time-consuming when one does not have, well, time to do it. Hence why i think the ideas of weeklies only is a good one for the next season.
---
I agree. I logged in earlier this week with all vendor items de-assigned for sale. That seemed like a big warning sign
---
To be clear, you’ve *always* had to do a minimum amount of damage, and thats true of every enemy in the game. I don’t know the exact amount, I’d guess between 1-2% of their health.
---
Aight so uh... how exactly are we supposed to go about getting this item and WHY!?
---
I was leveling up an alt last week and revisited there following the overseers quest.  I had forgotten how amazing that whole place is, it’s so massive!
---
Great idea :)
---
Take me home
---
Pistols are now affected by tank killer perks allowing them better piercing along with rifles now. So they just gave all pistols a buff.
---
I wonder if this was a necessary step towards the One Wasteland  that's coming out in the future.
---
I wish I had Fallout 1st for the private servers. Sounds nice
---
Guess I'll just sit on a corner and cry please dont nerf unarmed it's my favorite melee especially the deathclaw gauntlet, why doesnt bethesda just buff instead of nerf :(
---
I like that 😂
---
This is a problem with every live service game that I don't see changing any time soon. And believe me, if they made the change, you'd actually have the younger players complain that they don't have daily things to do. Closest I've seen to user friendly is GTA Online. They only have one thing that's daily and if you don't login for a few days, it doesn't restart your challenge streak. Imagine if we could grind for atoms for doing anything in the game like getting caps. In a perfect world, I guess.
---
Honestly, the score offerings have been generous. I've skipped many days and I'm at lvl 69. What's not generous is the 5k less potential atoms in the ten weeks each season lasts for.
---
Damn.   I was excited when I thought it was a nerf to just bloodied.
---
FORE!!!!
---
So nothing substantial, got it.
---
I have a two shot explosive minigun. It is fun. And you will not kill as fast as a Bloodied commando, but... You will kill.
---
yeah, I don't like this. this is gonna screw over melee builds so hard.
---
Oh that’s nice! Good decision from Beth. 
---
Thanks for the info
---
If they work as multipliers, yeah, if they add to the total damage an divide across their components, nah.
---
If they add 50% total (25 ts,25 e) and split the damage across 4 parts they would be mediocre
---
If they add the explosive damage twice for 75% total they would be as good as bloodied in total damage with all the drawbacks of two shot.
---
If they multiply by 1.5625 (1.25 X 1.25) they are probably the best in class by a decent margin at the durability and accuracy cost (1.3 for armor piercing)
---
If they multiply the damage by 1.875 (two shot + 2Xexplosive), yeah totally broken op
---
Any idea as to whether tenderizer got effected by this change? Currently tenderizer gets processed last since it’s an effect assigned to the target and gets applied to all damage (base weapon and bonus).
---
Semi-permanent, until she respawns.
---
Yes you are, you are dealing with people that understand your mind better than you do. Corporations are conditioning us every day in small silent ways. But you wont ever notice because you think you are too savvy to let that kind of shit happen to you. 
---
How you think your mind works and how it actually functions are two seperate things.
---
I’ll try my luck there thanks
---
There used to be SO many ghouls that poured out of the golf club. It's LAME now.
---
Weirdly i am having issues with one weapon in a positive way.
---
Bloodied shredding minigun is melting everything in the game.
---
No idea what has happened.
---
Sheepsquatch used to be a Bullet Sponge,now they go down just as quick as a death Claw.
---
No idea if it is Perk related.
---
I have a Zealots explosive 50 Cal with 30% extra damage to scorched that theoretically should be the Queen killer.
---
Does not come remotely close.
---
I get the bloodied minigun on the Queen her health melts.
---
That’s the Aaronholt Farm IIRC
---
It’s literally the only thing that keeps me paying I think. I don’t even use the tent as much as i’d hoped for.
---
I’ve been to the west coast between the raider outpost and I think workshop there
---
Make the game tougher/spongy/Grindy by dumbing down all weapons....by far the laziest way to make something seem challenging....smh
---
Found a stash of bufftats.
---
tenderizer works as before. that works based on the incoming damage to the enemy. they only changed things that are outgoing damage
---
So FNAF meets 76? Great....now I gotta go massacre killer clowns
---
I agree that bloodied needed nerfed like crazy but this screws over so many builds. I'm high health melee and this is gonna kill my damage output.
---
You are correct.
---
Yeah it's just straight up Lost Hills' entrance from FO1, and i love it. 
---
hope that however they are doing the shelter system, it just let's up put down an elevator entrance in our camp so we can see people try to recreate it
---
So you grinded for your lvl, that was one of the options I listed. 
---
As I’ve said before, there are only two options right now if you want the rewards, grind or cheat
---
Only grinded for 100+ hours for good bloodied items, traded god tier guns for bloodied weapons just so I can comfortably gather materials for me to build better camps. Gonna be kinda upset if this goes through :/ I understand nerfs and balances but when I’ve invested so much time into grinding for stuff. It’s gonna take me so long to farm for a new build.
---
I changed it back to default but I had to move my CAMP again to make it apply. Of course the blueprint wouldn't place so I'm at square one again lol
---
You meant to say FILTHY guitar girl.
---
I know of the location of which you speak...
---
She is sooooo hot! Why would you want to get rid of her? I like to believe that when she talks about needing new clothe that she is flirting with me....
---
I’m talking all the way from top map to bottom. 
---
I found it on first try for 2 of my buddies doing that tactic. 
---
Hope you find her!
---
I encountered something similar this morning.
---
Did 2 SBQ fights, but the quest never started for me both time.
---
I unloaded into her at point blank with a Bloodied Minigun dealing a fair amount of damage, well more than 1k.
---
But when she died, I couldn't loot her, and since the quest never started for me, I got no quest rewards either.
---
I figured it was likely some server issue and sever hopped, but haven't run across another SBQ event yet, so not sure if it's all better for me.
---
You can always get free wood from her, which is a plus.
---
That would have been my guess. Thanks for responding. This change actually makes tenderizer even more powerful conspired to other perk cards now.
---
Nope.
---
This post explains it pretty well.

I heard melee saw a nerf as well. Any details on this from the PTS?

I start killing it all if someone does it first.. know ducks gidbinn.

Yay Nightfall!

Can you please explain what this means? I see lots of people talking about 'magic' weapons but I don't know what that actually means.
---
Just intuition, because I do the same kind of stuff at work with MS Excel, and Excel is mostly used in work settings, so yeah, I could be way off base, but something tells me I'm not.

I wonder how many bases are gonna use this bunker and those chain link fences shown earlier and just recreate Lost Hills in the desert in the north of the map lol
---
I know I'm tempted to
---
People are calling it a bloodied nerf because bloodied is all they know. It's not even that much of a nerf because bloodied is still top lol, it's just top by a slightly less ridiculous margin
---
Leader of the pack gives you low level legendaries
---
"Long.. Live.. The King!"
---
Probably, considering the way they described it in the notes. If damage is easier to calculate and predict, it will be easier to scale mobs to that damage.
---
Why?
---
3 different golf courses actually!!
---
Golf would be fun as hell!
---
I’d probably only use the tent for the faction dailies to save some caps
---
There's so much flat ground up there too so it's a good bonus haha~
---
Top notch rebuttal, friend! The fact that many players in this community see basic criticisms of this game as appalling, is quite ridiculous, honestly. All good developers understand that criticism is a very important part of crafting a great game, and experience, for their players. So if the only response you can muster, to my very valid criticism shared by many others in this community, is “stop whining and leave”, then please see yourself out of this comments section.
---
Reminds me of that unique marksman rifle from new  vegas. The all-American iirc.
---
This is not true at all, she lands besides/in top of the tents all the time.
---
The problem is the stagger effect, just don't shoot her when she is in the air.
---
😭
---
ATX?
---
Now rejoice - we'll get to scrap all our perks for legendary perks! Hope you won't scrap the wrong ones depending on patch XYZ which will fuck up your whatever build!
---
It seems that melee might have an issue due to the new field they added to do this damage mutliplier not existing in the esm for melee weapons. There is still testing that needs to be done on it before we have concrete evidence about it. all weapons got nerfed in general so theres that
---
does the .50 cal needs a FFR to be magic?
---
Because I’m tired of seeing bloodied builds.   Everyone uses them, no real variety in what people use bores me
---
Wait I thought the change was making damage multipliers adders instead
---
Yeah it’s a cool spot!
---
Welp time to switch to shotgun lnfao only tse I got
---
How does the build another player uses affect the way you play?
---
mr gutsys over Lt. with rifles are broken
---
it will still be exactly as worthless as it was
---
Probably not considering Nuclear Winter takes place a few years into the future.
---
So how does this affect Junkies, Furious and Executioners?
---
You think I’m stupid? I still have non-bloodied weapons that are really good in case an over nerf like this ever happened. I know how shitty and incompetent and sadistic the devs are
---
And it sucks.
---
I ran a silo, just to see what would be like under these new settings.  Normally, my Bloodied Riflewoman breezes through it in about 10 minutes, most things die in one hit.  I'm obviously not expecting that, but I wanted to see just how different it was.
---
So, most robots are going down in a couple hits.  But the Laser Turrets?  Good gosh, they need 3-5 shots apiece.  They aren't difficult enemies, but you can't really leave them be either.  It would probably be worth it to hack and turn them off in the future and save myself the 200 bullets.
---
I launch on the SBQ.  When I arrive, there's already a 1-star Lv. 100 Legendary Scorchbeast floating around.  I open fire on it.  It takes a full clip from my Bloodied Explosive Sniper Rifle to budge its health bar.  This isn't surprising - what was normally north of 1,000 a shot is now 40-140.  I get bored fighting it.  It's not worth the ammo expenditure for a lousy 1\* thing.
---
The bomb drops and the SBQ shows up.  Again, I struggle to get above those numbers.  I don't think anyone else is having significantly better luck either as the health bar slowly whittles by.
---
And then here comes Mr. Explody Hacked Gun Man, who barrels up and melts her in 3 seconds flat without breaking a sweat.
---
Yeah, you know what?  This sucks, Bethesda.
---
Some of you might cheer that it's a Bloodied nerf, but across the board, everyone will be dealing less damage, and there is this one-two punch of having enemies that take significantly more damage in return.  The exploiters will continue to have a field day while we are stuck crafting and farming resources for ammo we'll never have enough of.
---
And here's the thing - none of this makes the game more challenging.  I didn't die more often as a result.  Didn't even come close to it.  Instead, you just made everything slower, a lot more tedious, and frankly, un-enjoyable.  These are still the same enemies, running the same tired routines we've had almost two years to learn.  Only now, in order to take them down, you've made it into a battle of attrition.  And attrition should never be confused with difficulty.
---
Idk, I thought it was just the 33% vats
---
So instead of multipliers on multipliers all your damage bonuses add up. 
---
Effects that still act as multipliers are pseudo buffed by proxy. Armor piercing, explosive, tenderizer, ect.
---
Wow! And they’re introducing a huge buff to all weapons so you’re basically fucking screwed!
---
It was a reward for completing a Colossal Problem.
---
This is a good point - for super drastic changes likes this maybe we will get a free respec :)
---
I'd be interested to know... I can hear other people but I can't speak unless I've got my headset on, and for lots of reasons I don't always feel like wearing it.
---
Erm. And the bloodied weapons will still be the highest dps. This affects every build. It’s a damage nerf. Bloodied will still be the highest dps just now with a top melee build you’ll 10k a hit on the queen instead of 18k
---
Other builds getting buffed up to compete with bloodied/junkies or bloodied/junkies getting nerfed to be brought down to other builds what difference does it make? Games easy as hell any way you spin it, something needed to be done idk if this was the greatest move but it’s something. Maybe itll require teamwork to kill the queen now? Yeah yeah magic weapons I use em too I’m just sayin
---
I usually turn it in and it takes 10 from me. Works just fine to me.
---
Yeah I totally agree but Bethesda is doing a major nerf to all weapons in the PTS. Enemies will actually be too good
---
Some of the bobbleheads are hidden in downright insane locations. Places no one would EVER go or look without that perk. Have you seen the one in Mount Blair Trainyard way up in some scaffolding that requires you to be a goat to reach it?
---
What do you do to crunch XP like that? What's your playstyle?
---
She can bug out if she gets nuked during the event. Once she’s dead she can be looted only that one time. If a silo is run again the next event will trigger and she can be killed but won’t drop loot for the remainder of the server. Might be what’s happening.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Still legendaries. Still scrip.
---
I think I've been to your camp, haha
---
I'm not really a fan of lowering the ceiling, but this could be the ground work for balance changes in the future. Lowerng the ceiling but also raising the floor.
---
Instead of having to find a balance for a large amount of multiplicative bonus, they would now have a set amount of addative damage they have to account for. Which would probably make it much more easy for them to bring underperforming perks up to speed without having to worry about accidentally make the next TSE/bloodied. Unfortunately that is being pretty optimistic, and I can see this going both ways sadly because this is Bethesda we are talking about. A little input on their end would be very welcome, and get rid of the rampant speculation, but again, its Bethesda. And as one traitorous scumbag once said, "Hope is the first step on the road to disappointment."
---
Bro STOP
---
No but ill check it out. Thx
---
Don't be. Really, I tested it earlier, don't be. &gt;!;\_;!&lt;
---
So I'll have to use two bullets to kill something instead of one now?
---
wtf bethesda this is bullshit but I guess this is just how things go in Drumph's America.  Thanks, Obama.
---
^/s ^if ^it ^wasn't ^obvious.
---
Ok witcher
---
Why doesn't Bethesda just dip the legit 76 players balls in honey, and stake them to an ant farm?
---
So long as you have a teammate. The +2 is the bonus you can always control.
---
Yasss this is so helpful! I haven't picked the magazine perk yet, I have it in my perks collection when yet but I'll grab it after I'm level 50 (I'm lvl 44 now).
---
&gt; fix magic weapons
---
Now that will fuck up my non-bloodied bloodied build. At least I have something that's appropriate to their bullshit "endgame" content currently. One wasteland, expeditions and other raids will be fun when they're scaled for non-existent builds.
---
I really hope your stuff is still there. 
---
I’m also in pacifist, so unfortunately that won’t make you safe. 
---
Nothing was taken from my stash, but I immediately signed off as soon as it began to happen and I realized I wasn’t having any cap updates- they still cleaned my vending machine out, though. 
---
So far, the best thing it seems you can do is just take vending down- and apparently Bethesda won’t help on this, if you are stolen from :(
---
As I read the title, it instantly reminded me of this https://youtu.be/YBDTU96QQvE
---
Unsure about vortex, I'm using quick config. Depends on which mod. The glowing item mod requires a lot of work/manual labor.
---
definitely still counts for daily and weekly challenges
---
*Edited to fix autocorrect
---
This would cause complications with the ESRB rating seeing as gambling is now a factor in the game. Seeing as the game is already M it shouldn’t be a big deal though
---
Dunno about Xbox, but that’s how it works with my headphones on PC. My mic only acts as a mic, I don’t use the headphones for audio, it all goes out through my Pc speakers.
---
It would be great if they would let us tee up a golf ball and swing away at a feral ghoul's head, lol
---
Good on you, but funny enough, I watch matches after I die and wouldn't you know it, those noobs are also generally the winners. So forgive my aura of doubt.
---
Agreed! Heck keep the gouls and whatnot, I dont even care!
---
Unfortunately Bethesda isn't into producing games that people enjoy playing.  They are mostly into creating games that people WANT to play, and then ruining them so no-one wants to play it anymore.
---
I hope you never hear of it! 
---
Time to invest in pc, especially after that next PS launch lol
---
Go to Youtube. Search "angry turtle magic weapons".
---
Because one-shotting endgame enemies was never intended?
---
Well you’re missing out!
---
I didn't know heavy magic armor existed, what is it?
---
As substantial as your "proof" that everyone hates it.
---
Not with the damage calculation changes, lol. If they kept pistol damage calculations similar to how they are on live, sure. But if all pistol damage switched to additive, output is going to fall far behind.
---
Just make another character as a mule..that’s what I do
---
I really hope they do because I made the newbie mistake of ranking some of my perks up too high and now I can't use them because there's no room for them plus the other perks I want to use instead.
---
A lot better than what it use to be. If I remember right it was only 300 at release.
---
My current run looks like this.
---
Spawn into base.  Two Sloth spawns outside;  (I seem to average about 1.2 or so per login).  
---
Warp to Cave Cricket Cave.  Run through - kill those 10-12 guys.  (very quick kill - net's close to 2k exp).  Warp to my tent- which is set next to Pylon V-13.  Normally either 2 level 75 fog crawlers, or anglers, or something.
---
Kill them.  Go clear mobs (including behemoth) from the abandoned bog town.  Claim it.  Go clear west tek.
---
During that time, if Uranian fever, Lode Barring, Nightcrawler event, or Swamp Fever pop - I'll do those.
---
After clearing - I'll either take a 5-10 minute break from the game (to clear private server reset) - or hop on a public server to see if any public events are up.  Or - if I'm not in a rush, I'll go do other random things.
---
But I'll do that quick run (takes about 15 minutes) every fresh server.
---
Well great, except for that part where they didn’t reply to me, yet still work behind our backs like we’re children. Sorry your vending is down, but I’m glad you have your items!
---
No, then unyielding would have more use....
---
They apparently have ridiculous vision too. I just finished the Belly of the Beast mission last night and I’d managed to sneak my whole way through the bog, past the scorchbeasts and almost to glassed cavern. Then somehow a mr gutsy spotted me from 100+ metres away, causing two scorchbeasts and dozens of scorched to come at me... luckily I managed to sprint into the cavern door before being ruined 😂
---
https://fed76.info/a/limb-damage-bug/
---
How would one go about that?
---
Ugh instead of nerfs to make us burn more ammo how about FIXING THE GODDAMN REGENING HEALTH OR THE SCORCHBEAST QUEEN. 
---
Besides blooded already has the massive negativebof requiring low health to be effective. Where a level 1 radroach can kill you quickly.
---
This is entirely corrent. Thank you for this wonderful explanation!
---
Because good builds weren't suppose to be oneshotting everything and killing the queen in under a minute
---
Not everyone has fo1st or people they can trust.
---
The SBQ is, in fact, fixed in the PTS.
---
I downloaded a glow mod and even then I nearly miss most of the bobbles/magazines.
---
Exactly as it affects bloodied. overall damage is down everywhere
---

The Chinese were sent MG34s the MG42s older brother, could also reskin it to look like the MG08 maxim which the chinese had their own version of. Would kind of fit the theme of heavy weapons since it's a water cooled belt fed machine gun

Worse, 200 in "beta".

So there's an opportunity to shut down the bots at the beginning of the event (see link) but it has pros and cons going for it.  Happy to try either way and see what works with the team

[easier PP](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bseezr/project_paradise_guide_for_an_easier_event/)
---
Never said that. Also why are you still replying when it's obvious you only got your fantasy silent majority agreeing with you to back up your statements?
---
Show me were Bethesda clearly wanted the SBQ to be easily soloed in like 3 minutes.  Or to one hit KO mobs so hard if the damage was distributed to other mobs in the area you could get 2 or 3 kills from one shot.
---
Explain how boosting other builds to this level of power is a good idea when even non optimized builds are able to kill everything without any trouble.
---
I'm hoping changes like that are a next step, but I think this is the correct first step.  They need to get the underlying math onto the new model before balancing specific underperforming properties.
---
This is a good change, it reigns in runaway combinations.  From here they can start balancing individual outliers.
---
Either fo1st or using someone you trust.
---
Agree, they need to buff berserker damage and make bloodied more vulnerable.
---
Nope! Keep them as is!
---
Does it effect bloody mess? The whole reason it's good is because it's a multiplier.
---
Explain exactly how Bethesda wanted you to be able to deal so much damage you could kill 2 or 3 mobs from a single hit if it was distributed.
---
I remember it being 200lb.
---
That plush and the Giddyup Buttercup ride are the two things I want the most. The waiting is killing me. I wish I could have everything in my camp themed after those two.
---
I deal with it. Even if they raise it to 1500, in two weeks it will not be enough.
---
I mean in terms of playing with two characters at once.
---
oh nice, i'll have to remake my Vault Dweller SCIENCE!-ist when that and one wasteland goes live, my old one morphed into a stealth suit Fixer assassin a long time ago :3
---
plus with What's Rad, getting hit by my Gamma Gun's radiation will be less of a pain this time too.
---
I will say, if the shooting gallery game actually works, I'll flip my shit.
---
Active camo? Reminds me of the Energy sword elites from Halo 1 ._.
---
That’s a great marketing plan, maybe they can fire their writers and hire you instead- guaranteed successful content.
---
It affects what I see in vendors, what sells from mine, it affects every public event, and it forces you to play a bloodied build if you want to pvp since the meta is so broken.   I mean, it -is- nice that when I get a bloodied weapon as a drop or from the purveyor that it’s basically guaranteed caps, but the game could really use a rebalance in terms of legendary effects.
---
ITT: people who are new to MMOS(or online games in general) and rebalancing. Guys this happens all the time, we'll adapt, we'll overcome. We always do.
---
He is probably not even.
---
That’s true..as a fo1st I rely on private server but yeah good point
---
Agreed.
---
They're probably the ones doing it.
---
It looks like a shack. I think you can even see a bit of the interior
---
You right I was just thinking I had too many scrips already I know lots of people don’t, just wasn’t thinking
---
Patch notes. Again, a clear lack of balancing is not the same as exploiting game mechanics outside of their intended purposes. It's just that they didn't start balancing until now, and they're doing it by nerfing builds instead of buffing them, which hasn't done favors for any RPG, historically.
---
Yeah that’s a good point
---
So, we play the game for years. Then one day it's decided to "reset" everything and "screw" the loyal players. Doesn't make sense.
---
No it’s a major nerf to all builds. Too major especially considering that enemies will be tougher for people over level 100
---
Explosive and two shot are not the same type of damage bonus. The main shot that you fire does not do more damage, instead you are adding a second hit that does an amount of damage relative to the first shot.
---
Explosive seams to still be a multiplier, dealing 25% of the main shot, and benefiting from all the other damage bonuses. 
---
If two shot is dealing 25% of total for the first shot, or 25% of the base damage, I don't know at this time.
---
Armor piercing is also multiplicative because again, it isn't actually a damage bonus, it reduces the effect of armor. 
---
Tenderizer modifies the damage enemies take, meaning it also acts as a multiplier relative to damage dealt.
---
Yup. It still multiplies your damage by the amount but it is added to all the other multipliers instead of being on top of them multiplying against them
---
Sadly that's the only reliable way, and fo1st private worlds are even 100%.
---
Next best thing is store stuff into a container that's secluded and hope you can get back on by joining a game from someones gamertag.
---
While I agree with you, they still have to do a proper rebalancing. They put out content that's appropriate for OP bloodied builds and glitched weapons constantly, I'd like to see them sucking less at game design and implement a more sensible damage/difficulty scaling.
---
Actually, now would be the time, because they can balance end game enemies around the new (and easier to predict and scale) end game damage output. What they are doing now is a good thing.
---
but why though
---
Was it really? I do not remember that, though I repressed a lot of the game at launch out of my memory.
---
Personally, was hoping for a SCORE vendor since it allows players to obtain only the rewards they want and grind as much as they want, but the next Season will be similar to the current one.  Weekly challenges would allow someone to play for only one day per week which is preferable to playing forced content daily.
---
Isn't that just for testing in the PTS though?
---
"To make it easier and more efficient to rank up, we’ve greatly increased the amount of S.C.O.R.E. you will earn from Challenges in the PTS."
---
S2 looking pretty damn interesting. Love the Cobra Commander inspired villain.
---
I’m sure those are only for the PTS and won’t go live. Just a way to test the system quickly
---
This isn't the first time they nerfed everything at once...
---
Bug abuse is the new meta you mean; magic damage is a confirmed bug.
---
That's because the game is tedious by design. You just happened to work around it with a broken build.
---
Well just make to different builds and playstyles. I have one for commando and other as a heavy gunner
---
Because there needs to be tough enemies. And Eminem’s that you have to use some thought and tactics to get past.
---
Murder hobo with an axe can’t be the solution every time.
---
This does go with one wasteland. And neither were really needed, considering actual annoying stuff like the VATS issues and the fast travel bug are still very much there.
---
This is why we need an Auction House like the vast majority of MMOs.
---
No. Magic weapons are of course not being fixed so now it’s an even tinier item Pool that everyone is going to actually be wanting
---
To my understanding its additive now instead of multiplicative. Essentially the more buffs you use the more the change will effect you.
---
&gt;Patch notes. 
---
Oh? Which specific ones?
---
&gt;Again, a clear lack of balancing is not the same as exploiting game mechanics o
---
When you know the game is unbalanced and you use that to your advantage it is an exploit. 
---
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exploit
---
to make use of meanly or unfairly for one's own advantage
---
Using imbalance set ups for your own advantage is the literal definition of exploit.
---
How is it that you feel a named perk that has been active in the game since release is an exploit or unintended. Bethesda purposefully chose to put this perk in the game that’s why Nerd Rage was added, why unyielding and bolstering were added, that’s why bloodied is in the game. Games like this are meant to have METAs there will always be a best build. What I play doesn’t effect anyone else I’m not one shotting you while you scrap gear and I’m not one shotting the SBQ. So why don’t you explain to the rest of us what vendetta you have against bloodied builds.
---
May have to grab an Anti-Armor Hunting Rifle to see how it plays out after the patch if this is the case.  May turn out better then Instigating with my sneak attack critical.
---
I like the Beckley Mine Exhibit workshop because it's easy to defend just by putting some wood walls and turrets up along the sides and there's three oil deposit nodes there (plus a gold and a crystal). I package the waste oil to resell plus you can kill robots in Beckley for steel and lead.  I'm kinda a new player so maybe I'm wrong but it works well for me!
---
Because I'm having a conversation with you on Reddit.  Why wouldn't I keep replying to you?  I appreciate your highlighting your social ineptness though.  I will keep that in mind in the future.
---
But im literally going to be weaker. Im being punished for having this build.
---
Why not just buff other builds? And buff certain enemies etc?
---
Rather then penalise people that have literally spent hours and tons of levels perfecting a particular build?
---
I feel like the drawbacks could outweigh the positives now, and if thats the case. Well....
---
Instead of making viable builds broken they should make the game less tedious to play in general. I would happily accept a bloodied nerf if they were to buff other aspects of combat in general. It just feels like history is repeating itself like how Two Shot or Pipe builds were nerfed.
---
Correct. Fisrt store in the left. The faction name is written right below the bot vendors in WS. This one have "Responders"
---
&gt;you're arguing that in almost 2 whole years, against all odds, not a single hardcore mmo player, the ones you most commonly find in online communities, showed up to talk about the game in any capacity.
---
&gt;I guess they're just that invested in Fo76, playing 24/7. the obvious explanation is that they don't exist, but no. let's go with yours, that defy all logic.
---
What I don't understand is why every time someone talks about wanting more space they always get downvoted and lots of negative comments. There sure are a lot of masochistic people on here. Other games I play have increased stash/collection limits numerous times as more and more items are introduced. It only makes sense, yet people on here just say deal with it or bring up how much lower it used to be as if that's relevant 2 years later.
---
Agree with all these ideas.... Green thumb perk + corn, tatos, mutfruit and a water purifier is all you need to make vegetable starch which you can sell for excess adhesive and I make enough for my self plus sell that in my vendor machine.
---
Ah ok. I’d have helped I with some gear. Ok. Your problem is basically u have a build that priority is based on carry weight. The only perk u actually need in carry weight is bandolier and that’s only if your shooting things. U want to get full unyielding armour. Even 1 star stuff is fine. Then, at your level I’m sure u have loads of the perks already, put blocker in strength and serendipity in luck and take radicool in endurance Drop to 19% health by standing in a river and getting rad damage  and check your carry weight. Should be 400+. Unless your a junkie u dont need all the drugs. I also don’t need to be carry 150 stim packs and food is everywhere so don’t over load on food. Once you’ve figured that out you’ll free up a lot of perk points. The trick to low health is mitigating the damage not tanking it. Blocker and serendipity do this. Things like green thumb, unless your looking in a nuke zone for plants, take off and use the 3 commando tank killer and concentrated fire. The way to then over boost your damage is in agility. Sneak perks like covert op and sandman will give you 3.5x damage. Take adrenal reaction serum because your at low health to further boost it and nerd rage. At that point without crits youll 1 shot everything. If u can get hold of a bloodied weapon that’s another boost but no necessary.
---
I spent over a month to get a stealth commando, grinded and traded for unyielding and bloodied weapons and now their just going to nerf it
---
Bloodied is shit for PvP, Junkies is the meta for PvP! Bloodied is PvE meta!
---
Bloodied/Junkies both need a huge nerf
---
Same here. It should have been this way from day 1 honestly.
---
I agree, the more and more I think about it the whole One Wasteland concept is kind of annoying. The enemies and their level are completely fine as of right now.
---
i agree with that statement but i'm not talking debuff them to a level 5 scorched with a pickaxe like basically reduce the fire rate or cut the damage in half from their attacks.
---
I go to white springs kill everything. Then to Charleston Capitol building kill em all. Lobby hop rinse and repeat. Boring but effective.
---
Yep, don't bother with the ammo converter, sell unwanted ammo for 1 cap each and it will go.  Buy ammo from players as well, but that perk that helps you find extra ammo is really good.
---
This looks a lot like the Secret Service helmet you buy from Regs, just with a different skin on it. The light works on it , too.
---
Bro I honestly didn’t even think about this and I have literally said it about every game I play.... but poker in fall out needs to become a thing. Even if it’s In a seedy back room somwhere
---
I don't think they do at this point, however sometime between Fallout 2 and Tactics they did find [and then crash] an airship or two!
---
Man this is a pretty good idea. Except I never see it active lol.
---
Just remember its on the pts, so it may not happen or may get changed due to feedback. I have 3 bloodied characters &amp; the commando has just become boring as its to easy to sneak &amp; one shot everything, so I think some changes could be good. Bloodied still does the most damage from what I've read in the Bethesda forums &amp; so it should.
---
Lets be honest here, most people are just worried about the value of their trade items, but that could also be a good thing.
---
Granted this article is from January and I have no doubt the numbers have dropped since then, but several hundred thousand players for an online game is pretty damn successful.  I'm not so so many people would keep playing a game they dislike for this long.
---
&gt;At the time of this writing, the player count for Fallout 76 is an estimated 22,000 to 34,388 players online for the PC version of the game, with console users for XBOX One and PS4 ranging at an estimated total of 400k users across all platforms, showing a decline from the 1.4 million copies sold at launch.
---

---
Guy, literally every patch since they nerfed two shot and explosive, but left every other build alone. Knowing that game developers did not balance an RPG properly does not violate the terms of service, or use the mechanics "meanly" or "unfairly." It's not an exploit.
---
Mines completely full with things I don't wanna remove soo...
---
Look up "magic weapons" on YouTube. There's a video explaining what's going on by angry turtle.
---
Radway is better than scrap boxes... At least I can get caps for them...
---
Bloodied was completely broken for a long time now. I'm glad they're starting to fwork on balance, but just nerfing bloodied isn't enough - other prefixes ad perks need serious buffs, too.
---
Why not?
---
I'd like to have some challenges
---
The only thing that can kill me at this moment is only poison and if I miss spamming stimpacks
---
It's also not good when you can solo kill sbq and should be able to solo kill colossus (haven't tried that yet)
---
&gt;How is it that you feel a named perk that has been active in the game since release is an exploit or unintended.
---
Because developers do not and can not come up with every single possible variation. This is why games like Magic the Gathering have ban lists for tournaments because massive advantages.
---
&gt;doesn’t effect anyone else I’m not one shotting you while you scrap gear and I’m not one shotting the SBQ. So why don’t you explain to the rest of us what vendetta you have against bloodied builds.
---
No you just one shot mobs during events that keep people from getting exp and drops and one shotting legendary mobs before others can tag them.
---
It also undermines the game and creates issue for new content. As bloodied builds would require massively OP mobs to deal with. Which then creates problems for everyone else. So scale back the problem build. Otherwise you have massive power creep.
---
I’ll go test it again, but I was pretty sure that a solo team didn’t meet the requirement of ‘teammate with a mutation’.
---
*Edit:  Just tested. No change in any of the seven stats while on a solo public team between having SiN equipped or not equipped.  My original point stands; you can control the +2 solo. You must have a teammate with a mutation for SiN to have any effect.*
---
I mean it’s nice that some of them are boosted to lv. 100, but it is a weird change that wasn’t necessary by any means. The same good locations from before are still the best
---
That seems a little absurd
---
Everyone will be running to their camps and pulling their TSE handmades off the display boards brushing off the dust and slapping the dense mod back on their armour.
---
The timer starts at the point everyone loads into the location I think  
---
I did one daily op and had a time of 8 minutes 15 cus I got lost and 8 minutes is the best time there is with biggest rewards.  
---
I also didn't have any server lags with the objectives and the locations Bethesda picked don't contain any loading screens. You just teleport there from anywhere on the map and once you load it the timer starts and you do your thing.
---
Yeah but not this big. Also, Magic weapons are now going to be the only weapons people really really want, no longer bloodied/junkie’s. The already incredibly small pool of desirable weapons is going to get even smaller when all people want is magic weapons and legacies
---
This was my understanding as well
---
Il be done with the game. That will be the nail in the coffin.
---
If the route they want to take is nerfs. Nah man. They should try making interesting enemies, be creative.
---
That along with the constant burnout feeling cus the daily bullshit. I will be done.
---
cheers for that.
---
I think everyone is over reacting a tad. If they reduce the damage bloodied kicks out with a handmade by 75% I’d still be 1 shotting almost everything in game. A head shot for my build is 2300 a hit. IF they implement it in its current state bloodied would still be the highest dps it will only really affect queen and wendigonand sheepy fights. Instead of solo killing the queen in seconds it might take a couple of minutes. Might be a little more fun not being able to to just blitz everything with ease.
---
Yeah I 110% agree. Video games need to be challenging. I recently played Fallout 4 on Very Hard and loved it. They just don’t need to nerf them this hard
---
It's only available to PC players through the Bethesda launcher
---
I usually just lower my prices a little and space gets freed up pretty quick.   Like 70% of my stash is chems
---
The nerf *should* fix the “magic” weapon bug, too
---
Have they bothered to fix magic? Just wondering.
---
They are literally re-balancing the entire game so you don't get 1000 damage Gauss weapons. You are not supposed to be able to solo the scorchbeast queen, yet some players do enough damage to do just that despite the 70% dmg reduction built into to fight to make it so players have to fight it in a group.
---
Certain builds are already insanely overpowered. This is a step in the right direction.
---
Whether the windingo colossus fight is imbalanced or not is a whole other ball game.
---
ITS FUCKED
---
Now that you mention it a level 15 was doing something similar- really odd acting. I ended up server hoping and he followed so I blocked him and hopped again
---
I had my camp around Vault 51 for awhile, was fun to build against a Vault door!
---
I’ve tried plugging a mic into the controller and into my wireless headset. Didn’t work. There are adjustments in game and in the Xbox settings but nothing worked.
---
What about areas like the Forest? Can you still pretty much just breeze through as a high level?
---
Well I already want to blow that raider scum’s head off so I guess I’ll give the astronaut a try
---
Ohhhh ok thank you.....Dammit I was excited to play that RIP......I hope we get access to it pretty soon or just the events and legendary perks
---
To the place
---
I enjoy it when the conversation moves to the point they are trying to alter the definition of words to justify their actions.
---
Exploiting imbalanced gear has nothing to do with ToS. But it is still purposely utilizing a broken build even though you know full well the build is brokenly OP.
---
Oh goodie...more skins I will never use.
---
Make Caravan Great Again
---
I think that they're testing the values there now and if they're going to be good then they''re gonna stay. I guess they need to find that sweet spot  
---
Since there is no point in ranking up in PTR cus you can't claim rewards and they don't stay
---
&gt;The problem is agree with both of you. What's a real solution for both answers?
---
To focus the core game on the things that make MMOs appealing within the framework of the game itself rather than on more or less arbitrary and artificial repetitive tasks with no real connection to forwarding the "world building" or narrative.  
---
Instead of "get x crits" or "harvest x corn", maybe implement procedurally generated, instanced, scavenging sites/quests. Or combat "dungeons". Or "baking contests". Or hunting expeditions. Or some sort of building challenges. Things that actually belong in the setting. What we have been offered is an Excel spreadsheet.
---
You shouldn't be testing the game in PTS if you missed the part where they say that is for the testing purposes only.
---
Same
---
Man that sucks. Need a budget upgrade. Plus I will be xboxless for 3-4 weeks after this sera son ends...
---
No worries, mate. 
---
I know I maxed out today and plan on dumping all of it tomorrow. I tend to farm this event and Uranium Fever.
---
I wasn't even crying about wanting more space, when I came back to the game after a year of not playing I was blown away by having so much space, I just wanted to have a discussion.
---
But this is not the same game that is used to be 2 years ago. Back then we had no viable way of trading and players would often sell everything to the NPC vendors unless it was a god roll and they would sell it on a trading community, but now we have more reason to have extra space. I am sure we will go to 1000lbs some day, with the dwindling playerbase most of the users are dedicated fans, fuck 90% of players I find have or atleast have had Fallout 1st at some point, and the rest of the gaming community scoff at those who would get Fallout 1st. But I am getting off topic.
---
It is Reddit, if you have a different opinion you can't just scroll past you have to downvote the post.
---
Two cents? That was at least $3.50.
---
So one level we will get 12 Nukashine???? WTF is the point in that? What a waste of a level.
---
Id rather have the care package of junk.
---
I already specifically cited Public Teams earlier and then clarified to you: *So long as you have a* **teammate.** *The +2 is the bonus you can always control.*
---
I’m not sure how you got confused but I’m glad this got cleared up.
---
Literally 99% of why I sided with Foundation
---
I’m fine with this change.
---
Oh great more stuff that is useless to me because I don’t have the camp budget.
---
They’re not going to quit. They’ll sulk about it and start playing when the next big update comes.
---
This effects everyone not just glitched budget camps, all it takes is for the glitchers to have slow laggy Internet!
---
Or buff other builds so you don’t alienate your player base by making the time they’ve devoted to playing valueless. What incentive is there for me or any other player to continue if there is the constant threat of our build being the next nerf. Bloodied is first to get nerfed, now junkies is too strong better nerf it. Now sneak crits is too strong better nerf it and so on until we’re back to bloodied being out of line again. Buff other options to keep your players who have stuck with the game playing. If the game is going to grow then enemies need to get harder the level 500 should be able to find a challenge not be stuck fighting level 80’s forever. If this game is to continue growing culling and reducing isn’t going to aid that. What you propose will breed stagnation. 
---
Just so you know since you’re devoting so much time to saying how im the problem for killing moleminers before you can hit them I rifle bash and emote.
---
Unless your buying bloodied weapons it makes no odds what you buy in vendors. In fact it should make life easier because your build weapons and armour will be cheaper. The only part of your statment that I agree with is a rebalance. Nerfs to damage output doesn’t do that and neither would reducing just the bloodied perk because it’s the low health and sneak perks and mutations that give the insane damage. Bloodied just over boosts it right now. What they should have done is tweaked the effects on other weapon types. Things like make nocturnal 100% more powerful at night building up to the max and dropping off and in the day dropping to a minimum of 20% more than a normal weapon. Not as it is where in the day it’s weaker that a standard weapon which makes it pointless.  Maybe Tse explosive will become super overpowered again
---
Magic weapons are probably now not magic anymore with the fixes, it seems they added the changes to the way damage multipliers not to nerf certain builds, but for other reasons. One of them is definately server-side damage calculation.
---
If the supervisors are level 100 does that mean that the gear you get from their corpse would end up be able to be level 50?
---
Yeah, it’s still easy. They seemed to mess up, though, and the forest caps out at lv. 25. More XP though I guess (when it works properly)
---
Personally I’m fine with skins as long as they are for weapons without many skins, or good armor skins (the red communist ones are pretty decent) but I definitely feel like there are a lot more actual quality CAMP stuff in this one compared to season 1, where we basically got some wallpaper, a tree, a piece of playground equipment, a crappy star projector and a secret door, which sounds like a lot but half of the stuff just isn’t even that good
---
Yep. It’s a huge overreaction. People don’t like change
---
I want things to change up daily so that its something new to do every day. Weekly would get boring and I disagree with your idea completely. You don't have to log in every single day to complete it, nor do you even have to complete the season at all.
---
 Enjoy the game, but don't take away from those that are able to log in daily just because you can't
---
That's a good idea
---
Atom shop.
---
And are they increasing everyone’s C.A.M.P. budget for this? 
---
Yes, I know, I know, wishful thinking.
---
Did you check if this change has fixed the effects of 'magic' weapons? It seems the change is down to damage calculation accuracy.
---
F*ck one wasteland. Who wanted this? First enemy scaling. I place my camp in the forest for a reason, I don’t want to deal with BS. Now nerfing weapons? How worse can this get?
---
I disagree. That means bloodied builds would get more healing because they do more damage (adrenal reaction mutation ). Maybe heal based off base damage of the gun without multipliers? Even still both ways would make automatic weapons get even more healing and still leave slow weapons behind
---
Shouldn’t be a problem with the broken legendary perks coming.
---
&gt; I just said I grinded and traded for the gameplay experience I wanted
---
Be honest, you grinded and traded to play the game in easy mode. As we all know Bethesda or their Fo76 division sucks at game design and balancing, which lead to one half of the players one-shotting legendary max level enemies while the other half is struggling.
---
I have no problem with endgame enemies being endgame challenging, but the imbalance of difficulty was pretty obvious.
---
Oh yeah, I often sell everything dirt cheap. In my mind there is next to nothing that is worth more than 5000 caps, most of the things I sell is around 50 - 800 caps, unless I decide to sell a god roll item like an Explosive Bloodied weapon where I would obviously sell that for like 3000 caps or something.
---
If that's what it takes to make the game enjoyable for everyone, including new players or players that don't shovel 8 hours a day into the game, then sure, go for it.
---
It happens, especially in games as directionless as this one.
---
Been playing since B.E.T.A. with 900+ hours played, and I have ZERO problem with them trying to balance things like this. 
---
Although they should definitely beef up BASE weapon damage with how Damage Sponge-y One Wasteland enemies are going to be.
---
it was never 200lb. it was 400 then 600
---
I hate it, I always hit the limit constantly and have to dump stuff that I don't want to get rid of.
---
Junkies might be the new go to for PVP, but I wouldn’t say it’s better than Bloodied. My friend and I who both run and extremely strong bloodied build kicked the shit out of some junkies who could barely scratch us
---
Good that chinese ironman mix looks so dumb.
---
it would be best to have an official transfer option so that people can just use alts to stash.
---
Why nerf the fun builds when they could buff other builds to make them more fun? As an end game build I want to be able to run around and one-shot ghouls and super mutants. That's why I'm a bloodied build. If there were other options to allow this I would give them a try too. 
---
If I want to take on a monster for a serious fight that's what the SBQ and wendigo collosus is for. More enemies like that would be great so long as they don't often get inbetween you and your farming.
---
Making every encounter a challenge just makes the whole experience Painful.
---
Bloodied pvp is vulnerable to radiation damage so if they know ahead of time that you're bloodied, there is a counter.
---
Uh, I could swear I’ve gotten those from events. As for which I dunno, sorry.
---
When is season 2 coming out?
---
With legendary perks, you’ll still one-shot pretty much everything.
---
It’s almost like the SCORE board is for all players and not just the super hardcore ones. Who would’ve thought.
---
Yes only the hardcore will reach level 100 but there are a lot of players that will get decently far into the pass who are somewhat new and still in need of these supplies. 
---
Yes from my perspective and yours it’s shit but to some players that may be a Godsend
---
Buddy, who are you talking to? My point is, according to even your definition, it's not an exploit. It is neither "mean" nor "unfair" as it is accessible to people through normal gameplay mechanics.  Is the build balanced? Nope. But when you call this an exploit, when there are clear examples of things being used as actual exploits (again, magic weapons) you're missing the point.
---
So does this mean magic weapons are fixed? They have either done this to nerf outgoing damage or they have done it to be better able to calculate damage server-side and provide more accurate damage counters.
---
How would bloodied builds get more buffs from this or you suffering from *bloodied build bad*
---
its a significant nerf to junkies and bloodied, as well as making most everything else slightly worse, while at the same time making enemies more spongy. 
---
its not even harder, its just fuckin annoying now, with this and the rubberbanding its starting to be too much. as if we didnt have enough grinds, now the entire overworld is grindier.
---
Seriously, how is a nuke weaker than a melee hit.
---
Nah dude this stuff deserves a nerf. 
---
I know you spent a lot of time getting the stuff you got but you knew this nerf was coming. If you didn't know this nerf was coming then welcome to the experience.
---
I knew keeping them would pay off
---
I mean let's face it, this was bound to happen at some point. Hard to make *anything* new to the game a challenge if you can just melt it in 5 seconds with little fanfare.
---
you‘re telling me you had to fight radiation in the forest and were always low on radaway? yes surely it‘s a godsend for sooooo many players. if you need more radaway than already in the game, you‘re doing something wrong. low level or high level, no matter. people low on radaway are clearly too lazy to explore.
---
I just farmed multiple spawns of ghouls in nuked whitesprings less than a week ago?
---
Game city!
---
It's always the case of "which one is it?" when I see them, if at any point I hear dakka over phizzle then it's into the backpack for the sponge suit~
---
Does anyone bother to wear raider?  Or wood?
---
A toaster is just a death ray with a smaller power supply!
---
Actually they did, we PVP’ed with them a for a good two/three hours. So they could clearly see our health. They tried using a gamma a few times, though it didn’t do much cause both my friend and I have SS and had on lead lined
---
Only if it has Blackjack like in New Vegas.
---
As long as it's Witcher 3 Gwent and not shitty spinoff Gwent
---
What? Bethesda made something that looks good? Good on you guys.
---
I grinded and traded to play the game with the weapons I found. I didn’t find good junkies weapons I found good bloodied ones. I play the game with the best build I can. No one is going to pat me on the back for putting my bloodied guns down and instead use mediocre weapons with an unoptimized build. “Easy mode”... I’m playing with the META this isn’t a new concept. Destiny, Borderlands, League, even COD all have them. And if the other half is struggling nerfing bloodied doesn’t change that. It just means everyone is struggling. That shows that making other builds viable is better than making all mediocre.
---
Oh yeah I forget to mention laggy internet on there end
---
Everything else was nerfed too lol. Bloodied is still on top.
---
Again, adrenal reaction mutation gives damage boost the lower your hp is, on any weapon. Damage boost with OP's suggestion means heal boost.
---
👏
---
No they didn’t.
---
its horrid..
---
Umm wasn't it 200 at launch?
---
&gt; Instead of making viable builds broken 
---
You got that backwards, the build was broken, they're trying to fix it now. But I agree with the rest of your post, nerfing something to make it non-OP is not enough, they need to implement serious buffs for other prefixes/builds to really push diversity.
---
It does just not this much. And yeah I know it was. That’s why I’ve been saving a few weapons for when it does
---
Maybe an in game pvp and pve arena bets could be placed on
---
Nah I love being a GOD
---
True, a good chance that this could also fix the magic problems.
---
Precisely what I do. I wear WWR armor on most of my characters, and I can dish out 1 hits on most enemies while also being one hit myself. I'm fine with this. I'm rewarded for keeping distance from the enemies.
---
If GTAO was anything to go by, it'd get banned a lot of places.
---
yes, better than scrap boxes. but still there are better alternatives to radaway and radx, alternatives that would make every player happy, no matter low or high level. for example more lunchboxes, or rewarding XP right away, or more ammo scrap kits, etc. radaway and radx is pointless, lbr. no one is low on that.
---
Too many people swept this bug under the rug and poo pood it because they just assumed it only effected glitchers without really investing the threats properly because "they're goody two shoes" who can't possibly get hit.
---
Of course lol all damage builds including Beserkers got hit.
---
I guess the point is that it doesn’t really matter.
---
Yup, hopefully they get removed.
---
Yeah but they’re not. Everyone’s going to be after those Magic weapons and not bloodied, junkie’s or really much else. There’s already a tiny weapon pool that people care about and it’s just getting even smaller
---
Oof. Hope it doesn’t stay.
---
5 pieces of unyielding armour and low health... yeah you can waltz into that casino and get kicked out 5 minutes later.
---
Yes! I would love to see this as long as they wouldn't try and implement Caravan somehow, still have nightmares about getting the achievement for it.
---
I just hope the SBQ fight won’t be annoyingly long because of it, and that bloodied is still strong enough to one-shot most enemies as long as you have the right perks, mutations, etc.
---
 I want that Brahmin costume that was leaked so bad.
---
How does Furious work now?
---
Some people don’t spend hours trying to optimize their radaway and rad-x gains and plenty of new players do not have enough of either. 
---
I already said it’s shitty for people like us, but I also have a suggestion for you. If you hate the rewards so much for the pass why play and complete it? Because we all know you’re going to when it’s comes out. You’re bitching around and complaining when you know you’re going to do the pass to completion and claim all the rewards no matter how lazy they are.
---
I understand their lazy but it’s happening and at this point it’s your own fault for expexting too much from Bethesda
---
Also running bloody unarmed, and have done this exact thing a couple times. Not sure if it’s an inherent event issue or specific build bug, but can confirm it definitely happens.
---
Glad you like to get off on others misfortune.. what a sad sack.
---
Finally, someone with the guts to post the reply I was waiting for!
---
Good to hear, thanks for the feedback.
---
Similar to what I did in NV. 9 luck, bought implant to get to 10, then played blackjack at max bet and always double down on 1st hit. Cleared out all casinos in about half an hour including loading screens
---
I think the Protectrons at Responder's Train Stations sell Pew Plans?
---
This is good potential news.
---
The current system - would have made it extremely hard to continue to add incremental improvements - as everything would result in massive upticks in damage.  (think, diablo 3).  On the same hand - while you are right, it's not a bloodied nerf - it does hit harder on things like bloodied which stack multiple buffs.
---
50% and 50% turns out to be 125%.  And so on.
---
Yes, but the effort falls short if prefixes like e.g. mutant's, medic's and stalker's are still inst-scrip. Nerfing the one OP build doesn't change the fact that other builds still suck, or suck even more because they're also affected by the nerf.
---
You need to be a mod.  You like to be in other people's business and try to get them banned for things you only think they did. 
---
You're usually not very nice to people on here.  The mods could be doing a better job of watching your posts. I'm not sure I've ever seen you post anything helpful. 
---
Tyber messaged me and when i told them to leave me alone, they said i was stalking them when they were the one messaging me first.
---
They have a chance to spawn at Welch Station.
---
IIRC, at Aurum in the Whitespring also check the Charleston &amp; Morgantown vendors
---
dude, that‘s literally the purpose of the PTS. giving feedback. and seeing that a lot of people agree, i don‘t understand why you gotta paint me like the bad guy now. i can‘t be bothered, honestly. some people in this sub have their mind already made up before they make their first comment and it shows. i’m sure your fucking high and mighty ass never complained about anything in their life. kudos. bethesda makes changes based on PTS feedback, as shown with the legendary perks. but blah complaining is so pointless. have a good one.
---
lmao this made me laugh a lil, dw man just play with some of the sheepsquatch stuff.
---
A lot of times things get nerfed... then nerfed again. This might only be the start  
---
its good you have a back up plan
---
Been playing a lot since around March. I think if that’s the case I won’t feel like playing anymore. Not only because of the nerf but because I feel like as a player I’m both worn out and I also feel like we’ve all put up with a lot of shit that wouldn’t fly in games made by other companies. As you said it’s the last nail in the coffin. But like I said though I’d be willing to see how it actually is in-game but it really doesn’t sound good at all, all weapons getting damage nerfed and along with addition of one wasteland where enemies are up to level 100... doesn’t sound very good.
---
Yeah and they’re not gonna do it. Take Berserker’s for example. Imagine how great and challenging it would be if you did like 300% the damage of your weapon but had pretty much no DR at all. But no instead of buffing this they’re nerfing it
---
Low health builds can already do this with automatic vampire weapons, why not let them use other weapons too? 
---
Also Vampires with low health will get less out of the effect, since they have less health that to heal. They would probably rather use a bloodied weapon since a couple good hits kill them anyway, why bother healing?
---
Why do people pretend that Beth listens to their user base? I suppose it’s comforting to pretend the love is real I guess.
---
Screw one wasteland...fix VATS!
---
What they changed is that they made it so bloodied will still be the best since it has the most amounts of synergy and boosts, but it will be like 10-16 points of damage stronger, instead of hundreds. I think that is more balanced than a 1000 dmg gauss rifle compared to other effects that don't even break 150.
---
All dmg effects got nerfed, meaning perks, chems, everything that boosts dmg. So every time you buff through dmg buff it's multiplied by the base damage, instead of adding on top of the new numbers each time you multiply.
---
So this closes the gap.Even if you are not going with the best, you won't feel like you are so outclassed by the best.
---
Remember that SBQ is supposed to be a group fight that's why there is a 70% damage reduction for groups. Any build that lets you make that fight a joke is a broken.
---
Pirorities, now they are again nerfing the shit out of melee. If this becoes final im surely quitting lol
---
no
---
Make it 1600 lbs, and two more tabs for bobbleheads and magazines. And store items, as in if your selling it in your vendor than it will only be visible in its designated tab.
---
Have you ever done a low hp rad build? Vampire weapons or stims overheal (and that overheal is lost really quickly). They get the same benefit but loose it as soon as they stop firing
---
I did the math with a BE vs. a TSE .50 cal and even with level 3 nerd rage and adrenal reaction at 20% health for the BE the TSE will still does more damage. So yeah. Bloodied weapons are going to be shitty and it’s all the devs fault.
---
That’s not what they said. 
---
With those numbers, we’d max out the board in about 10 days. 
---
This is for testing purposes **only**. Just like when they gave everyone a bunch of perk coins to rest the legendary perks out as well.
---
Thanks.
---
You are evil incarnate.
---
My gauss mini and magic minigun still melts the imposter in seconds. Thank god
---
Plus the company
---
With the bloodied build nerf (well, just damage nerf in general) I think it should be a little more difficult, but wouldn’t doubt people would still be able to one-shot.
---
How would bloodied use vamp weapons? You mean anyone with adrenal reaction? Also why not get more health regen if their health is much lowers?
---
Feels like enemies might have been nerfed as well though.
---
Through all of the wastelanders dlc characters responded like I made different choices. So thanks Todd, it just works
---
Yeah, have a exploding golf ball mod
---
Bringing a whole new definition of being teed off at something.
---
They've only confirmed they're working on it which they also said when the game was in beta so I'm not hopeful.
---
Legendary perks don't add damage save the one that boosts sneak.
---
I know that. But still, one-shotting lvl 62 ghouls and other endgame enemies with full auto is not working as intended and is cheesy easy mode. That their content is improperly scaled towards broken builds and glitched weapons is another problem they definitively have to work on.
---
“Fix this, fix that. Never seems to end.”
---
Sorry, I'm using bloodied to refer to full unyielding with adrenal reaction mutation. And more hp regen just makes those builds safer instead of the trade off its supposed to be
---
Box priced w/ paid expansions (caveat, said expansions must be significant, prices on a sliding scale dependent on their value-add), with an optional "grind" for atoms available so that players with more time than money on their hands can still "earn" their expansions (which are purchased in the atom store).
---
DDO worked(works?) like that and it seemed to me to be a pretty solid approach. Each expansion cost anywhere from $5 to $30 bucks in the "DDO Store", players could pay straight up or use "DDO points" that they earned in-game for doing various things which mostly blended well into the game and felt "natural". Toss in a variety of store-only utility items, some of which cost upwards of $50 bucks and more or less equated to paying a premium for conveniences, which helped level the field between hardcore players with infinite time and players like myself, who can stand shoulder to shoulder with a hardcore player skill-wise, but have more money than time.
---
I know a lot of people get all twisted up about "pay to win", but I think a reasonably considered avenue for plunking down cash money to compensate for the lack of time to grind should always exist. It doesn't make sense for me to blow off $100/hr actual work for a game that, in the form of game-only "currency", only pays me like $5/hr. All things being equal, if I spent $10 on an item or spent 2 hours grinding for that item, at the end of the day the game is that much better off because now that unemployed guy avoiding his depression by spending 12 hours a day grinding loot is going to have a larger pool of other players that can contribute to end game content. Which really points out the true problem with FO76, there's really no end game content. No real reason for that 1337 rare power armor grind, or perfect 3 star legendary, all of the "end game" content is doable with player crafted gear.
---
Ideally my % based damage heal would be on par with how much healing automatics get now, but slow weapons while they have less dps and therefore less heals would still get some health spikes when they are hitting
---
I’m hoping it’ll let us pick up holotapes and access areas in there, so we don’t have to do it in the lobby.
---
I’m well aware of how Strange in Numbers works. Which is why I said the +2 is the only part you can **directly** control. 
---
You need a **teammate** to get the other +1. Therefore you cannot directly control it solo. 
---
My point didn’t need any addition, and it didn’t need a contradiction after I clearly explained it. 
---
Thank you. Have a good day.
---
And goodbye. Try your *‘Ackshually’* B.S. on someone else.
---
*youre lol
---
I understand the rad kits are shit but what else are they going to put there? They’re not going to whip up a ton of new rewards to replace those in the 3 weeks before the season starts. I’m not painting you as the bad guy, I’m simply saying your complaining won’t do anything about it. And honestly yeah I’ve made up my mind. I’m doing the pass until I get the PA display. That’s the one reward worth it to me in the pass so I’ve made my mind up with what I’m going to do.
---
Full health new servers, no change just repeated Mutant's an assassin's and more nocturnal. I'm done, I'll just wear my standard armor. A waste of scrip. 
---
The game's RNG is weighted or out right rigged.
---
Seems like we’re all experiencing odd behavior. 
---
Good on ya!
---
On any other day, I wouldn’t have stayed on that server, but they happened to catch me at a great time... for them.
---
Take my money damnit!!!! 
---
Brotherhood bunker camp item at **LONG LAST** hell fucking yessssssssssssssssssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
So like a heal based off fire rate so of the weapon fires slower it gets more heal per hit? I could get behind that
---
I actually do I have a BSS Sheepsquatch staff and Club very fun to use and cool looking with the burning mod. Just sucks one of my favorite looking weapons might potentially be nerfed depends on how the people in the pts react . If no complaints then I can see people using different melees now i guess that can be seen as a positive
---
Exactly dude. Hopefully the fanboys will recognize this
---
Building public team + events
---
I am neither bloody or junkies and I one shot everything I point my gun at. This may or may not effect me.
---
Never gonna happen bud
---
Unfortunately, that's the rookie Bethesda MMO approach for you. They just plain suck at balancing, otherwise things like OP bloodied or 100% bonus dmg two-shot would never have happened.
---
At least i do t get shit legendaries from the purveyor over and over when i do t have to. Thats the real sad story.
---
Ah... so 100% of the time with no bugs whatsoever
---
So... it’s a GI joe parody. Nice
---
Ten bucks says his name is Commander Commie
---
Dunno if I need harder eminems. He goes pretty hard...
---
E: pls give harder eminem.
---
You're welcome :D
---
I’m a bloodied build and I’m not quitting and as OP replied bloodied will still be the best legendary effect for raw output
---
One guy certainly melted the SBQ in front of me when no one else even came close to doing that, so I'm tempted to say no, they haven't been fixed.  I've heard speculation that some specific cases may have been, and perhaps this wasn't one of them.
---
Another player tried to do the same thing to Earle in A Colossal Problem.  I'm not entirely sure what was going on there because while Earle's HP was taking a nosedive, it seemed to be rubberbanding just as quickly.  Kind of like when someone shoots at the Imposter Sheepsquatch while it's invulnerable.
---
It is easy enough already, it should be a grind to get to the end. Its purpose is to get people logging in every day &amp; that worked
---
They added them to the drop pools last patch. If you know the plans they can drop for you
---
I would have expected them to address the magic shotguns, but they went for something else instead. It's weird. I don't use the bloodied Unyielding combo for the damage, but for the special points, but it is easy to imagine 100% of magic weapons being used.
---
Shit - I’m just excited for glass roofs. Skylight, anyone?
---
Oh damn that is so awesome. I can't find anything that said they can now drop but I guess i should've read the patch notes.
---
It’s only been 25-26 years after the bombs, I’d assume that Maxson loaded as much gear as they possible could before taking off to lost hills bunker. I think at this point in the BOS history is when they would have the most amount of equipment and supplies at their disposal, just think of all that gear just sitting waiting for war ammo, rations, vehicles and the parts needed to repair them.
---
I hope so
---
It’s not just bloodied. Literally all legendary weapons.
---
No it was 2 star executioners and faster swing speed
---
So like I said, pc problems
---
"We all glow around here"
---
No I'm not addicted! Ive just been putting points into luck so I should be better this time. Really! I swear!
---
So if this is what Bethesda considers a rebalancing, they need to go back to the drawing board. Balance occurs when there are more than two metas in the game. Given that the fucked up the legendary perks,  why am I even surprised they can fuck up rebalancing the game.
---
Well we're inching closer and closer to Instanced CAMPS, so we just need to hold out until then.
---
Beth are fucken clowns.
---
If you're gonna cripple our builds you need to let us re-roll our perks. I'm not grinding another 75 levels to give myself a playable build.
---
3 two shot explosive handmades,
---
2 two shot explosive 50 cal,
---
two shot explosive dragon,
---
two shot explosive combat shotgun.... yet, I just pulled a bloodied tesla yesterday and a bloodied 33 handmade today.
---
get a .38 vampire 90 weight reduction weapon, a pipe rifle, a combat rifle or a fixer. even a 10mm autopistol or smg. 
---
even if you’re not specd for commando you can just switch to vampires, heal yourself and htan switch back to main.
---
no player is editing their vending machine
---
Open a support ticket. If you did accidently buy something they can see your transaction history. Maybe get a refund if thats the case but not guaranteed.
---
No one here can help you.
---
Well, alongside the bloodied nerf it might work occasionally.
---
Grey camp is displayed once player has just joined the server, after a minute or so it will be active. 
---
Stuff you see in vendors is kind of a bug, usually helps me to reopen the map and try again
---
Edit: didn't notice its out of the map boundaries, either using some glitch or I don't know how that's possible
---
No. They’re still leaving magic weapons out! So that and legacies will be the only weapons people give a shit about.
---
&gt; Thats just being facetious now. I've seen plenty of posts complimenting the game. Just because you ignore them doesn't mean they don't exist.
---
Ah so the addatives add together and the multipliers add together then multiply the base+addatives by the collective sum multiplier?
---
I’m pretty sure it’s a consequence as it was a change across the board
---
Junkie’s had a 30-40% nerf
---
The issue I have with armor skins is my character never has it exposed. He always wears outfits. So skins are never seen. I dont play in 1st person either so weapons skins are barely noticed by me too. So for me personally theyre something ill never use. Same with power armor.  But I agree there does seem to be more quality camp items this time. I also get a lot of players arent into CAMP building so could care less about those items too. Im hoping this time they improve on the SCORE system itself a lot so its less of a grind because I still have 10 squares to go in this one and Im over it. As much as Im excited about some of the rewards the next one has Im not super keen in jumping straight back into a second round of heavy grind so soon after the first
---
&gt; are now an additive multiplier instead of a multiplicative
---
Nice.
---
bloody mess now uses the same entry point as all the other effects do which means that it just adds to the multiplier instead of multiplying the already multiplied damage from all the previous buffs
---
Should be ammo points or scrap
---
I believe so. Basically anything that isn't food or drink
---
Clickbait post title. This is a everything nerf across the board not a bloodied nerf just some dmg calculation readjustments
---
Kind of looks like a Wendigo dressed up in a clown costume to kill you this time.
---
Have you seen the Animatronic Clown CAMP item on the PTS though?
---
Yep. Think of it as a replacement for 3* Traveling Pharmacy.
---
I'm probably gonna dip if they nerf everything. Lately I just find myself staring at the map wondering what to do, where to go...
---
Bloodied will be fine. It’s the only build that is actually a build lol
---
Could we finally be able to see again the team leader active quest?
---
I don’t mind a nerf in general. In fact I actually welcome it. Just not this extreme
---
This. Just sneak your way into the cave and do it fast. You don't even need to kill the scorchedbeast in the end.
---
I feel like maybe don’t nerf bloodied like this just nerf the multiplier and buff everything else also I think mutant weapons should deal more damage the more mutations you have not just 10% no matter if you have all of the mutations or just one
---
That or make it based off a % of the weapons base damage and not take into account mutations, perks, and chems
---
Ok are speaking from what's been posted or have you actually experienced the change against the enemies?
---
you remember incorrectly
---
Yeah I understand you, I’m super burnt out on this game and have been for like a month now, only playing for dailies and weeklies and not even doing those sometimes, I still have 25 squares left, and I won’t make it doing just the challenges but I want to get to max rank so bethesda is going to Get even more of my money. But when it comes to skins on things, it all depends on how a player plays, a PA build would love more PA skins that they don’t have to pay for since they are normally absurdly expensive, but other players wouldn’t care, just like how a PA build or someone who always wears an outfit wouldn’t care about armor skins
---
Is this why people put pie for like 25K caps as protection?
---
There is/was a big casino with a dog track in Charleston. It’s definitely plausible.
---
I just want to caveat this.
---
We have no idea at this point how much of this is a work-in-progress and how much isn't.  For all we know, we're looking at a first pass, where they just copied the existing numbers over and didn't really tweak them to fit the new algorithm.  Some of these high-level enemies made not have realistic HP numbers either.  Valseek warned that clarification may not happen today, and it didn't, so maybe we'll get some answers on Monday.
---
I also want to make clear that I think that shifting everything to an additive approach *does* make more intuitive sense and makes things easier to balance.  I actually don't have an issue with Bloodied being nerfed to some degree, as it is ridiculous (albeit cathartic) that I can run around one-shotting everything in a silo.
---
At the same time, I think about the players who *aren't* Bloodied, Junkies, or who may not be running any kind of build at all.  After all, if *I* find it tedious, and I'm familiar with the ins-and-outs of the game and am gifted with these Legendary advantages, what is *that* player going to do?  How are they going to stay on top of these resource expenditures and grind the ammo they'll need?
---
This also goes to the core of the direction Fallout 76 ultimately wants to take.  Are we reasserting this kind of wonky survival game, where you need to count your bullets and question whether or not something is even worth killing in the first place?  Or are we maintaining the current as-difficult-as-you-want-it-to-be sandbox game where you hang out with friends and shoot a giant bat every now and then?
---
Really, only Bethesda could tell us for sure.
---
They literally just have to port the UI for caravan and black jack in FNV and then they’ve got it. Also having the roulette and slot machines from that game would be nice too. If luck helped your chances that would be great too, based off of all the VATS builds that are most likely running tons of luck crit perks.
---
I dont want it at all man.
---
Save time in the future and assume you’re wrong. 🤙🏽
---
If I just started doing the pass, could I finish it before it ends?
---
Some things should be better with certain legendary effects than others.
---
I like base damage. More fair overall
---
Why do all people saying this also happened to them have a fresh new reddit account? 🤔
---
OP, you had plenty of chance to record a video of that. It's only one button to push on PS4.
---
Technically you’re right but given how shitty the Devs are I know they’re gonna screw it up and I will admit bloodied weapons need a nerf just not a 60% one
---
Seems every 2 weeks or so they have a week where they have only got like 1 or two items an a bunch of trash to throw up.
---
Don’t expect them to address bugs ever.
---
I think they’re just being extra every time I see that, on the off chance someone with a dozen mules humors them. Because with this, they can steal that pie immediately, and seemingly everything else. But I can’t speak for them lol
---
This isn’t new it was on the over a month ago
---
Honestly this would be a great location for roleplaying and would add so much more to do. Imagine playing poker while a nuke goes off nearby lol.
---
Well dang, there goes my vendors! I was wondering why my Bloodied Assaultron Blade dissapeared without getting caps. Thanks for the heads up!
---
Fuuuuuuuck that! Uh uh, noooo thank you.
---
What’s been posted. I used a weapon DPS calculator online made by a dedicated fan. I’m not high level enough on my PC to be a proper bloodied build
---
Same. I carry a lower damage per shot  gun Bc of that
---
Oh no.. theyre nerfing bloodied?... its a good thing I didnt invest all my time and effort into a overpowerd build knowing that it would some day get nerfed, but then again its on the Public Server so if you crybabies act now and throw enough temper tantrums it will..... do nothing... come on guys it aint that bad... dont quit
---
If you follow the river bank north you can get out off the map

People think the Disciples in Fallout 4 are creepy, wait till they see this...
---
As a Hongkonger and a designer IRL who dislikes communism as much as the westerners hate Nazi, these are my 2 cents on the communist theme from a design perspective:
---
* The font type of the chinese slogan is not good.
---
* Having a anti-USA slogan printed on every armor is like printing a 'Communism sucks' slogan on every Enclave armor. It is lazy stereotype and it looks bad. It is like seeing westerners not knowing the Chinese language having weird Chinese phrases tattooed on their body.
---
* The big red star is already a clear and elegant symbol as a motif for communism.
---
* Design-wise, I am actually fine with the outfit with the flat cap and the one with ushanka and mask. It captures the spirit of what the people, and the Red guards, would wear back in days during the 60s/70s.  (Wiki the red guards - brain-washed kids that did horrible stuff back in the days)
---
5. I would suggest Beth not to continue emphasizing the communist theme if the original intent is to sell it to Chinese customers. It is a scarred reminder of the 10-year Cultural Revolution even to them. Well, maybe not to the young Chinese customers because probably they don't know their history well due to censorship. Keep pushing these communist skins for me is like making a Gestapo skin. It may look nice, but some people are not going to be happy with it.
---
follow the road east of foundation, to a wood resource deposit next to a stump with small woodpiles. an NPC will spawn there. usually its some form of woodcutter, but i've occasionally seen the raider punk, settler forager, and wanderer there.
---
Another avenue for micro transactions, of course.
---
It's not significant to them and slightly to everything else, it is exactly the same nerf to everything.
---
You're still going to 1-shot everything anyway.
---
and as I've already replied to that, before you decided to throw a fit, how many of those posts belong to mmo players? none. or virtually none.
---
pvpers for instance are constantly giving their opinion, from a pvper perspective, in the current state of the game. but mmo players never share theirs. and no, it's not because 'they're too busy playing the game'. it's because they don't exist. otherwise they'd share their opinion, from a mmo perspective. the same as literally every other human being playing this game. especially being subset of hardcore gamers who are usually very active in online communities. and if they existed within this community, they'd have already made themselves heard, at some point, during the past 2 years. but they never did, not to any meaningful extend.
---
this conversation has grown surreal. you're making obnoxious points that defy all logic. and here I am, repeating myself ad nauseam, like a caricature. I honestly don't know what's with you. are you just having a giggle? because the bottom line is that no, the playerbase by and large disagrees with the point you made originally. period. there's nothing else to discuss.
---
FOMO. Fear Of Missing Out. now next time you see it, even if it isnt on sale, you're more likely to buy it.
---
I am all for harder enemies and challanges, but making things even more bullet spongy is lazy and weak.  I hope they reconsider these changes, because this camel can't carry all that many more straws.
---
corrent = correct + coherent  
---
You invented a new word, I like!
---
And you can't tell if they belong to mmo players, no matter how close minded you are about them
---
Vegan Teargas? LoL
---
No, you don’t. It was **never** 200 lbs, even in B.E.T.A.
---
It’s a myth that has been continually perpetuated. 
---
Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/X5XUj_ZKBqs) from pre-release. Four days before, in fact. 
---
The stash limit was 400. Not 200.
---
Watch out, now! Don’t hurt ‘em, kid! 
---
So, who said I didn’t record it? And what’s even your point? 
---
This is obviously a community issue, and whenever someone feels like talking about it, that’s what the platform is for. 
---
Now if you actually read my post, I submitted a ticket, with my information, to bethesda, the end. It’s a DISCUSSION, mmmmmk?
---
How about they spent the time and resources on not making a half ass golf sim inside the game and use it on fixing bugs and adding real fallout content.
---
A casino ? It's the apocalypse not an amusement park they said before.. lol
---
I have my tent there for fast travel. I don’t have a jet pack or marsupial so I do not even get on the top of my own tent. If the SBQ doesn’t land for awhile I move the tent to get people off it. They always seem confused but then go climb on top of wherever I replace it. I don’t get it...you are level 300, what are you afraid of? Why are you on the tent? Come down and fight scorched mirelurk kings, Yao Gui’s, and scorched deathclaws like the rest of us.
---
No, it wasn’t. It started at 400. It was never 200.
---
They might add some new skins that makes things look brand new
---
Nope. 400, then 600 then 800. It was never 200.
---
Oh nooooo, I’m sorry to bring the bad news :(
---
It’ll all come back around eventually

I can, because they never share their opinion from a mmo player perspective. for example, there are dozens of posts a day complaining about the grind, the time gates, the artificial limitations. things that are all too common for mmo fiends as we've already established.
---
but there's never any mmo player actually defending these decisions and their skinner box, like you're doing right now. there's never anyone actually calling for *more* grind.
---
and before you say it, no. it's not because they're too busy playing the game.
---
You are getting a flat free power boost with Legendary Perks.  This included a perk that doubles your ammo production.
---
The game will be more challenging with daily ops.
---
We just got an ammo generator with Wastlanders and an ammo converter with Legendary Run.  Ammo was never a problem before, now we're swimming in it.  I can't imagine complaining about using 200 bullets to run a silo, your stupid ammo generator will have made 200 bullets by the time you get back from SBQ.  I don't even make bullets to shoot anymore, I make them to get rid of the stupid lead piling up in my inventory.
---
What platform?
---
Yeah, I was a sneak rifle who recently went bloodied part of it was the ammo conservation, I spend so much more time now playing instead of counting bullets and farming to make bullets.
---
The other part that bugs me is the time put in to get decent gear to be a bloodied build... I'd be less hurt if getting good gear wasn't so RNG based.
---
I didn't know that. But I never saw a grayed Camp like this. Probably per being in an "not authorized area"
---
You can get out the map sure, but as far as I know it doesn't let you build a camp out there. Although, it'd hardly be surprising to know someone figured out a way how.
---
Pipe rifle does not benefit from both perks, only the pipe bolt action and revolver do if in rifle form
---
I've got 2 Xbox's and 5 accounts...limited stash space are my mule's problem.
---
Mad Dog Malone has escaped again
---
You get goooooooolllllllddddddd
---
....Oh, shit, you’re right. I completely misread that.
---
Thanks for the info about vendors items. Never wondered why it happens from time to time...
---
It just works
---
I wonder if the spiked club is a sheepsquach skin or another grognak or super sledge skin
---
She doesn’t land enough because no one bothers to run into a clearing and aggro her. I’ve been in so many events where she doesn’t land for a long time and the second I run into an area without tents or buildings she lands almost immediately.
---
This is fixing a day 1 bug.  Damage mods never should have been multiplicative, that is idiotic.  This is the proper way to do it.
---
Actually, I misread what you typed. I thought you were asking about the backpack. To answer your original question...I don’t think even Bethesda knows. All I know is that the super popular things go in and out a lot more often than everything else.
---
plus the  5 nuclear keycard reward... who needs that?? I mean i can shoot down a cargo vertibot in like 30 seconds. That is not a reward worth crap.
---
It will still be better with higher dps weapons, but slow weapons will still get bigger spikes, but much less of them. 
---
Right now, a .50 cal heals about 19.2 hp per second, while a supersledge heals 1.1 hp per second...how useless
---
Same.   Psn is boredomshaman
---
I play pretty much every day starting 3 hours ago if that matches up with you?
---
And there is the discriminatory bigotry again.
---
Tag says PS4... so maybe PS4
---
XD I'm just going to leave it like that
---
I would play the shit out of fallout 76 golf, ngl. In GTA V that was all I did most days, once online started to suck.
---
that's not an argument.
---
1. You sacrifice your soul to Pennywise after he catches the Scorched Plague.
---
2. *_Because NOT getting it is not a valid option in this world._*
---
*laughs in Bethesda*
---
oh so it‘s you‘re high and mighty ass? is your ass a seperate person or something? at least you tried. if you wanna correct others, learn to read first. :/
---
well well, lots of new items is coming, some of them are really cool. I still hoping they will add a fish tank with beautiful fishes.
---
Then stop acting like mmo gamers are less than you with your pretty insults.
---
Which is silly IMHO. In a post apocalyptic world anywhere there are 2 people, a deck of cards, and a bottle of whiskey there WILL be poker. Hell they'll make bets over who can hit the empty bottle with a rock from the furthest distance.  
---
Gambling is in our soul.
---
Yes my friend, game on.
---
I don't think ammo will be that much of a problem. The game throws ammo at you from every direction now, and the further you progress in the game, the more ammo options you have: events, ammo boxes, enemies, workshops, scrounger perk, ammosmith perk, super duper perk, scrapper perk (for mats), ammo converter, raider ammo factory, collectron (with atoms).  
---
At this point, I drop a ton of ammo after every play session and I don't even pick any up willingly unless it's my type. I'm using an AA heavy guns build.
---
All events say 35+...
---
that's also not an argument. I couldn't care less about how you feel about my choice of words.
---
Bloodied will still do the most damage compared to any other class regardless after this nerf, if it even happens because its still in the PTS stage.
---
Not actually as horrifying as you might think, mostly wacky 'boing' sounds, and a donkey noise.
---
It’s much easier to simply farm the materials and craft your own.
---
This is the way every other game in existence does it because it's the proper way to do it.  Being multiplicative is idiotic and why people could 1-shot the SBQ by stacking so many melee buffs.
---
This is fixing a day 1 bug and is good.
---
Haven't seen anything on sneak damage though, is it additive or multiplicative?  Hopefully that didn't slip by them or sneak flamer and Fixers will still melt the queen.
---
Aren’t you able to join any event on every level?
---
We need a community event for the Whitespring like the one for Atlas. Deliver X materials, earn rewards along the way (Whitespring flowers for our CAMP, a palm leaf suit.) At the end of the event the cottages reopen, allowing you to rent one for 24hrs with a customizable instanced interior. The internal rooms reopen with some special vendors and such. Other floors of the hotel open up, with rentable static rooms.
---
I would love extra legendary modifiers. Durability and weight reduction for sure. Some extras: + specials, poison dmg, incendiary dmg, bleed dmg, cryo dmg, rad dmg, rad resist, poison resist, disease resist, deflect dmg back, accuracy/hipfire/range/recoil buffs and so many more.
---
I read the sentence as “you’re high” lol. I guess civil discussion is out the door
---
Only tried 1 and got murdered lol, count even kill anyone at 40+ levels so I guess yeah I can join
---
unarmed went from 1400 down to 400 dmg. while muties leveled up to 75 and 100. so no. not anymore. that is if you can get a hit to even register.
---
damage from commando got cut in half, and junkies for hit for about 30% putting it back down to meh tier.
---
most other stuff sees and effective 6-10% drop, making everything else slighty worse than terrible.
---
This is actually what the BOS materials were for
---
I’m on the fence on the one wasteland situation. On one hand, having a auto leveling system allows you to farm other places besides west tec BUT it kinda takes away from seeing obvious progression (like even stuff in the forest isn’t super easy to kill.)
---
Kinect
---
and they sure as shit didnt need to nerf everything else too.
---
This, right here. This is background work to go along with one wasteland, which is essentially going to be rebalancing the game anyhow. Once they do this, future balancing efforts will be much easier to deal with.
---
Considering the noises the Santa makes that’s a surprise
---
Lol, well the SH bonuses are borderline nonexistent on public servers for me currently. I may as well stick to T-65 for now, all I'm getting from SH is Meat Sweats Lite.
---
Yeah and the specific day in September is the 8th for those who were wondering.
---
So the brotherhood is gonna come back to a fanboy whose made millions of clown costumes for all of them... that would be the biggest F*ck you in the history of F*ck you's.
---
Just join, tag some enemies and grind events, you’ll get to like level 50 in no time, don’t forget to sleep, play on the instruments to receive xp buffs, eat food to increase intellect in special, cause it affects your overall xp gain, and do side quests
---
You for sure saved me from more lost items, and im sorry about your lost weapons too! Thanks for the solid heads-up!
---
Exactly lol everyone is like "HuUrR so glad I only have 1 bloody class and its going to become useless" no, its still going to do the most damage/dps than any other class. It lost a good chunk of damage and so did all the other classes, its still going to be king, just not over powered.
---
What if the brotherhood was just a dream and we instead accidently helped a maniac?
---
I still think it should be higher. Either that or the Fallout 1st Scrap Box, which is unironically Pay-To-Win, should be given the everyone for free
---
It wasn’t all for nothing after all, I got to help some rad people! 
---
Right on!🤙🏻
---
sneak damage is still multiplicative after all the additives
---
*Todd disliked that*
---
the pts is on xbox?
---
2+2=5 I guess
---
I agree, and I have Fallout 1st. No player should have 10k Steel.
---
Tell me more.
---
100% this, no farming methods just pure seek and reward
---
Pretty much the state of it 2020
---
Thank you! Explained very well and hope to stop seeing "BlOodY BuIldS ArE UseLeSs NoW" lol its still the best and will always be the best until Bethesda starts buffing other classes like berserker. Oh wait lol they nerfed that too in the PTS.
---
And I love how it was so heavily advertised in the pre-launch videos
---
It isnt very far from the truth at this point like seriously who needs that much shit? where is he putting it all? Wouldn't the brotherhood bring there own supply's? Why would we want them back anyway they aren't exactly the nicest of folks?
---
Goddammit berserker is hard enough. What’s the point of it if it doesn’t do damage anymore
---
I agree. They need to buff other primary legendary effects such as Berserkers and bring it up to spec with bloodied builds (which in turn should receive a minor nerf cuz of how OP they are maybe like 20%). Seriously imagine how fun Berserkers would be if they buffed it. You could do like 3 or 4 times the damage you normally would but with virtually no armor. You could one shot so many things but in turn you could be one shotted really easily. But nope instead they had to nerf it and everything else under the sun
---
I like the idea but I could also see how they'd try to charge real money to buy chips and turn it into a grindfest and that makes me nervous
---
balancing is what people have been crying about for months and months.. 
---
why is everyone complaining about it now?
---
maybe next time yall will be careful of what you ask for..
---
just sayin...
---
Inb4 is becomes the new Red Asylum Dress lol
---
hell yeah this is the kind of stuff I want if bethesda is going to hire almost exclusively artists anyway
---
100% AGREE.
---
feeling forced to play otherwise you will missout on rewards is the worst feeling ever for gaming... makes the rewards more of a burden than a reward.
---
I get incredibly burnt out if I feel forced to play &amp; grind dailies for rewards I will otherwise missout on if i do not do every challenge without fail... it just doesn't feel rewarding or fulfilling and especially isn't fun, its a tiring burden that zaps the fun out of whatever game it is. 
---
honestly becomes so draining that I just end up not wanting to play and get extremely burnt out (goes for any game). the season pass on fallout seems to have the most draining dailies of any game I've played with a season pass.  I've missed so many dailies and weeklies from being burnt out... its now impossible for me to grind it out to get all the rewards. 
---
at least with RuneScape's seasons it gives 50 levels, each with 2 tasks to choose 1 from to complete to get to each level and you can do them in your own time &amp; pace, granted you do them within the seasons time span of course. while some tasks can be a pain and a grind, i have the freedom to pick and choose when I want to do them. some much more relaxing and stress-free.
---
I really like the idea of putting an arcade in, plus something like a safety deposit box to allow the transfer of items between characters, and I’d like to see a trade hub, the trade feature between character is awkward, so something straight forward and simple
---
That’s exactly what I do too, sad that it comes down to that. 
---
Bethesda’s thought process is: “Does it benefit us financially? No? Ehhh it can wait and be delayed a few times”
---
I'm totally down to play a Gwent inspired Fallout card game
---
Time to farm the fuck out of the event
---
Lots of hidden potential locations honestly
---
This was before I understood what was done. I can’t, in fact, change the post title.
---
I would like to disagree. I play unyielding for my main character and I have to be so careful with enemies, especially ghouls. They one shot me. Do good damage but die so easily to some enemies. Can't do nuke zones either because power armor and stealth armor take my buffs and slow me down. So for at least me, unyielding is not overpowered. Well not entirely.
---
balancing is what people have been crying about for months and months..
---
Wait around.  Had an... odd server once where the event started up maybe 20 minutes later.  Wait around elsewhere that is.
---
“The Grand Heist on the Whitesprings Resort” 
---
...would make a great mini DLC update
---
my purified water storage is gonna overflow with the amount of tears from whiny little kids that cant accept change.
---
had a kid 'order' me to farm stuff for him cause he 'needed' more ammo... while he was jumping around mag dumping his bloodied gun. its not the first its happened.
---
Or u can give her free wood winkwink nudgenudge chucklechuckle
---
Everything that deals damage has been nerfed, people assume bloodied because only bloodied is used
---
This sounds fantastic but sounds like Bethesda would rule it as “something something too complicated with the net code to implement”
---
As a melee character who frequently role plays as a mad golfer ... I approve this message.
---
Thank God they nerfed bloodied, it is an interesting and useful build but not when literally every single person is doing it.  Every single time I join a group every single member of the group but me is bloodied build.  That completely prevents the purpose of a healer build which would be great for hard fights.  But when you all get 1 shot killed every hit, it's ridiculous.  But the damage was to insane not to go for it for most people.  Best possible group I've ever been in is with a dedicated tank build who can keep aggro, a healer, and a variety of dps.  The problem is Fallout really doesn't have very many fights where it matters what you are.  The scorchbeast queen is on a timer and she has was to many HP plus she flies around all over the place.  The Colossus is the only fight that I can think of that can be done by a great team.  I wish they add more team content.
---
Alright thanks
---
You’re correct. I should have specified that. Thanks!
---
I’m not a fan of any of these items sadly
---
Never used it, does it highlight them or something?
---
I dont think you will notice the Armor pen much since everythings getting nerfed as it seems....
---
Ya that happen to me and never showed up
---
Do 7 get sleepwear 8 ball and implant. Or you know the almost perfect perk but that’s the long con.
---
They should make the pool tables playable. That  type of feature was available in GTA San Andreas.
---
Imagine if u had tournaments and could win loot if u won
---
Weird I see people mention it when stash is brought up
---
How sad and stupid from beth
---
Can you see all the rewards? I'm trying to find out if those green house walls and roofs are actually in the  rewards.
---
The architecture already exists, it’s just a matter of developing the world updates and the reward items. Really comes down to where their priorities lie and what they envision for the future of Appalachia.
---
Nah, I get kicked out of the casinos around level 8-10
---
buffs being multiplicative is such a noob move... Beth whos your theorycraft team? have they ever played an RPG before?
---
I haven’t been crying  about balancing tbh. Yeah, the game would def be better if it was but most things people ask for the devs don’t listen and the things they do listen for they screw up, balancing included. They’re over balancing things. They’re making everything a bullet sponge and the only great weapons will be the magic ones.
---
Quick question mainly because I don’t really understand What has and hasn’t been nerfed due to numbers but does this affect Unyielding ?
---
Yeah they’re need more builds. To do this they need to add more perk cards. Like an accuracy build (add perks like +30% HS damage while outside vats) make weapons/a mutation that are called sharpshooters. (The effect would be +35% accuracy outside of vats. The mutation would be +50% accuracy outside of vats -50% accuracy inside vats) there could be other perks that could be “your automatic rifles automatically reload if every bullet in the magazine hits (does not work with vats)” or “your sniper rifles deal an extra 15/30/45% damage and stagger an enemy for .5/1.5/2.5 seconds on a out of vats headshot”. Just something to add more builds into the game.
---
Honestly... that sucks.
---
But it's for the best IMO.
---
The Meta in this game is ridiculous and it ruins the game for every single person who isn't wiling to kill their build in favor of actually staying alive.
---
Hopefully after they Nerf all this stuff though we start seeing a blanket buff to sorta help even things out.
---
I know if this isn't evened out queen battles will be even more awful.
---
First time I've seen it.
---
No. I got bored of it long ago.  
---
Any game is open to criticism good or bad.
---
Kind of. Just the amount of bonus +3 strength/int gives. Basically, keep on rocking.
---
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY ATOMS!
---
Well, bloodied builds lead to the player (especially melee bloodied) to die a lot more so I think the massive damage is justified.
---
Hey I’ve already gotten two perfectly preserved pies from the vendors since launch! Although one was in the loading vault for Nuclear Winter so I didn’t get to keep that one.
---
I miss gwent.  You have me tempted to spin up a new game of witcher 3 now.
---
I think that was me doing the plan and stuff drop. One of my fav things to do is seek out players who are low level. I batch up what I am going to drop one person at a time. Then spend the next couple of hours running about dropping stuff. It is fun to do.
---
Oh no we cant have the boss bugged lmao
---
I agree. Free earnable stuff of good quality is what the game needs more of even if its something that doesnt appeal personally.
---
Its always hilarious to kill them while their still playing. Cause even though their head is in twelve different pieces they still find the time to finish off the sick beat instead of stopping abruptly.
---
Why have prefixes at all if guns do around the same damage...this one size fits all narrative is getting old from BGS, just like everything newer being character bound and non tradable...they give us options to trade and then take the option away because of 3rd party trade sites, BGS is salt because they can't sell guns and armor for cash without the community blowing a gasket...so now we all suffer with weight we can't move and time gated scrip....nothing BGS does ever makes sense.
---
I hope doing the BoS stuff will move you up in ranks in the BoS, like the other FO games. As you move up in ranks, you get access to new equipment from their vendor and the appropriate PA paint if you haven't already gotten it from Forbidden Knowledge.
---
Typically, Super Stimpaks heal more than a regular Stimpack.
---
It seems too low to me too - compared to the things to buy.
---
At a minimum bump it up to 100k;  that gives us half a million per account
---
Back before legendary scrapping, it also tended to be a legendary swapmeet. People would put spares in the till or the garbage can at the artisans location. See something you like? it's yours. Got something neat but not useful to you? leave it for someone else to enjoy.
---
You also used to find legendary weapons and armor in vendors, sometimes a ton of them if someone was unloading after a good haul. I got a junkies explosive gatling plasma from a vendor back when they were still lootable for around 400 caps froma vendor, and it continues to serve me to this day.
---
What do you mean by typically?
---
Ohhh was that the joke?
---
Ok so you should probably wait and see what people say. These changes may be a proper way of balancing since the enemies are supposed to be getting a rework.
---
It should be double or weight of most items, especially weapons and armor should be reduced.
---
17-20 pounds for a handmade is ludicrous.
---
  In every other Fallout game they were present in, they've healed quite a bit more than a regular stimpack. I've honestly never used them in 76 so I cant say for certain.
---
Where was it revealed?
---
I love it! But it does make me a bit sad, they NEEED to do something about the camp budget because I want to show off ALL the thingsssss
---
Hahahaha
---
Finally, TSE will once again reign supreme!
---
I have patiently waited for this moment!
---
How long before the community fix the game for bethesda?
---
Ohh gotcha, I figured they would heal more due to older games in the series doing so. Who knows here tho lol
---
Wait my intelligence is gonna be affected?? Nooooooooooooo my Xp gain :-(
---
That gas mask, the Ranger outfit and a shovel. Then I can do a Death Korps of Krieg costume. Can't wait
---
I am usually good about this, but there is one exception: Radiation Rumble. It can be so hard to spot the buggers in the horde, and I am killing nonstop to stem the tide. If there is a bunch of people I'll swing a tesla rifle to ensure I don't accidentally murder one, but when it's three or four folks? Sorry, mate, not on purpose, but it happens.
---
Right lol. Other games they also rebuffed your strength by 1 or 2 points as well, if I remember right.
---
I'll stick to FO4 if I want a body mod experience.
---
FO76... you do you? I guess? What are you even doing? Are you okay? Do you need help?
---
I assume it's asking for shit
---
Probably not. With all the information that was shared between the Appalachian chapter and the main force at Mariposa they theoretically have the ability to manufacture a vaccine. Otherwise yeah, they probably just pop'd a nuka and carried on.
---
Magic?
---
So I tried without and heavy gunners and ot still Put in was much work as a gatling lazer so I'd say perks definitely help
---
Fix? What's that? Never heard of that around these parts.
---
I agree, even survivors need places to have some fun.  Would be great to have some sort of robot dealer blackjack tables, slot machines, and toy horse races.  Omg how fun would it be to bet on races.
---
Nerfing again? Might as well refund all of us the money and time we invest in the game and stop developing the game.
---

Yeah I deal with it by finding other, better, games to play. It just works.
---
I like harpers fairy, go thru, kill all enemies and keep all the weapons they drop and scrap em all within harpers fairy. There's a chem bench near the vendor bot in the center. Or uranium fever, land a shot on as many enemies you can, loot every body after the event and scrap it on your way out
---
These rewards actually have me excited unlike this season. That all red Communist paint for the secret service armor looks awesome  and the scout mask gets a red paint job as well. That is definitely replacing my camo skin. 
---
And that brotherhood bunker. Is going to fit right in with my brotherhood base on one of my characters.
---
In the atx pictures. the picture of a gun rack with the double barrel shotgun sitting above the rifle. Is that a new commando weapon or just a skin for the handmade?
---
You can relog to the same server to fix the lag and loot
---
You kno, after getting a better look at the gameboard and the rewards on it i this is in fact the BoS themed season they talked about. At first i felt the rewards were to heavy on the commie side to be it but after seeing the BoS prefab is actually in this season and that the final reward is the Ace Full Assault PA skin i changed my mind. It doesnt have a pic of it in the datamine bc i think its already in the files and is being renamed. I think this is what the Virtabird PA skin will be, which makes sense bc its uniqueness is on par with the captain cosmos one from this season. Its still clearly Gi joe themed but i do retract my statement that season 3 might be BoS themed as well, cud be, but this seems more likely to be it.
---
Yeah bloodied is getting nerfed into the ground... I understand why to move the meta, but I dislike how
---
Edit - well it’s not JUST bloodied. All damage is getting nerfed. Forgot to add that.
---
Here's my take 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i8thv1/changes_id_love_to_see_with_one_wastelandbos/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
None of that is going away and your hard earned bloodied toon is still going to be the king of the hill, but now damage calculations will be more predictable and "inexpensive" to calculate for the game. This in turn makes it easier for the devs to put together encounters that work for a broader range of builds. As opposed to the "just add shitloads of HP" strategy that more or less requires any given team of players to all be dishing max damage (bloodied builds). Some less obvious benefits of a simpler damage calculation might be server stability, bug mitigation. It seems, in FO76 anyway, that the complexity of damage calculations at scale are definitely a significant factor in application performance.
---
I wish I’d known this before I made my post. It’s not a bloodied nerf. Thank you.
---
Equip the scrapper perk and scrap all the weapons from uranium fever is my go to.
---
I like scrapping guns to get extra steel. I like to run through west tek research killing the super mutants and looting the guns they drop. If you have the scrapper perk card equipped when you scrap I usually leave with a decent chunk of steel. Another good one is doing the line in the sand event and looting the scorched afterwards
---
Yes it does
---
We already have one! The Rusty Pick.
---
Are you serious? The fact that enemies are getting the type of rework they are makes the situation much worse. Enemies can only scale at a max of level 100. So for anyone at or over level 100 is going to always have to face level 100 enemies. Normally this would be a fun challenge if they didn’t nerf guns so fucking much. Unless they make significant changes (which I’m betting they won’t bc they’re 76 devs) the game will revolve around getting basic items like ammo crafting materials and stimpaks/aid. So people who don’t like to grind and just wanna kill things are forced to grind because they need the very basic things to kill enemies with.
---
The new rewards look awesome, for a free battle pass this is some good shit and I think your being a little entitled here.
---
I know my stealth sniper gets absolutely mauled if I am on the ground. I don't even shoot the things, they'll just decide I am delicious and chew on me. Still, I got into the fence habit some time ago, I'll give the grass a go again and see how it ends up.
---
Totally!!
---
What really there’s three? I only know of one
---
Ghouls cause rad damage. You can clean the Whitespring with a Bloodied character and no DR (hazmat suit). If you are sneaky, you can avoid ALL damage. 
---
Test it: get it by ghouls while wearing a hazmat suit. It just works.
---
You need the right perk set. Blocker and Adrenal Mutation, just in case. Dodgy to tank and Serendipity to avoid. It is really, really, really hard to die when you build it right. And if you add Chems, then you have no excuse. 
---
Bloodied Unyielding is so broken, that it even allows you to get better prices and pass all dialogue checks, whatever your special points. It's God mode.
---
You can exchange missing Foundation equipment for bullion
---
This isn't a hope lol. This is what they will do for sure, or at least some variation of what you described.
---
Wholesome
---
I just did a lucky hole mine run today in excavator armor.
---
Got 455 lead ore.
---
I haven't seen any footage on the damage Nerf, but I'm all for it.
---
I have six characters all with different builds/ play style and there isn't much that they can't kill in seconds.
---
Do try the suggested fix of analyze blood sample before putting the T-type fuse in, apparently only the first person per server can successfully analyze the sample until they fix this. I had a char stuck on it too but tried it and it worked brilliantly.
---
For raiders I don’t feel bad. Most settlers are just innocent people trying to get by so I don’t fire at them.
---
It is not Bloodied builds melting the queen, it is hacked and magic(bugged) weapons.
---
Yea I remembered incorrectly. You all can stop harassing me now thanks.
---
Just put one of these bad boys in front of your camp’s fast travel point, then sit back and enjoy the show.
---
Balancing is a good thing but it's sad they're being lazy about it. This is the easiest way to fix it, by nerfing everything, rather than be creative and try to bring up other builds. 
---
It's also really clear that the rumors about the dev team are true. Either they're cycling people in and out when devs have downtime, it's an extremely small dev team or all brand new and inexperienced. 
---
Oh well. I'll still play but not sure for how long. It's such a grind in the first place with dailies, score, reputation and now knowing the armor/weapons you grind for can be hugely nerfed means it's not really worth it. 
---
I got my monies worth and am happy, just sad that what this game could have been and what it is are so far apart.
---
A deserved nerf
---
Hell yes! My number one complaint about this game has nothing to do with devs. It’s just that I never have anyone to play with. My gamertag is NimbleKitty9490. Anyone here add me and say you wanna play 76. I welcome anyone and everyone
---
It’s bad but i personally think there are worse issues in the game.
---
There are some problems with this becuase some countries wouldn't allow the game anymore.
---
Gta went through a whole debacle about there casino dlc
---
I don’t do a massive amount of flux farming, but when I do farm anything with a spoil rate I always equip max level of the good with salt perk under luck. This perk keeps your food/flux good for much longer, and I’ve never had problems with flux spoiling before I’m able to craft it.
---
A lot of people aren’t looking at that weight set. Not only does it look cool for like a military training center, but it also gives strength
---
wonder if shotguns still do stupid damages in vats... even if they nerf my 3k gauss shotgun (with all the buffs) it's still doing tons of damages heh
---
yes me and a lot of other players are acting entitled because we‘re receiving radaways and radx. truly awesome rewards, yeah. 
---
not talking about the indeed awesome greenhouse or BoS bunker here, you know that right? it‘s about FIVE RADAWAY that you get as a reward for ranking up. i‘ll find you 20 radaways by going through the Whitespring Resort ONCE. how am i and many other players entitled? the devs are just lazy. and this sub keeps having the two to three people who keep excusing EVERYTHING. progress, yay! if it wasn‘t for people „complaining“ and acting „entitled“ your legendary perks that are coming soon would still be shit and you would almost get no perk coins to level them up. :)
---
School starts for me in a week or so, but I’m on almost every day
---
It’s a bug that occasionally happens, It sucks
---
Thankfully I still keep my screenshots since they are copied to my PS4 capture gallery but the reason I take them is to have them as loading screens
---
Ouhkaay thank you
---
I only added glow to stuff I need, lead, screws, etc.
---
Shit. There goes a years worth of memories...
---
It's not a punishment its balancing. No one can really argue bloodied has been too powerful, making every build OP obviously isn't the right decision and making enemies tougher would still mean youd be less damage to them so theres no difference
---
Ok I'll add all u guys my psn is Xxjthebeast23xx
---
Psn is Xxjthebeast23xx
---
Not all of us are like that tho
---
How does that work?
---
I mostly bought the ones that gave me atoms, so spent 150 and got 150 back. I also bought a few that gave me somethin I wanted like the chicken coop and peace pipe skin. It would of been doable for me with the double dailies and extra payouts coming soon but I don't feel shamed or regret buying maybe 9 in total
---
It's only happened to me once tho lol, prob ran the event over 500 times
---
The difference is the advantage you get for lowering your health to a point where you can super easily die is suddenly a lot less. Instead of 3x more damage its more like 2x. My pipe revolver went from headshotting a lv68 super mutant for 3400 damage to 521 on a lv100. Thats almost 1/7th of the damage before. At that point i might as well just go full health, the bonus damage isnt enough to be worth insta death
---
How do you get to be first person in server? I've relogged over a dozen times and still try every log in...no luck
---
Make a sub or smthn
---
If you mod through Vortex, i don't think you do, but there are some mods that vortex cannot load properly.
---
SFE is one, that has be to be manually copied over to the .exe folder.
---
Some others, where there are multiple options, like the glow project, vortex also cannot handle. These have to be manually added to the custom.ini file
---
I mean bloodied builds can easily melt the queen as well. But all damage across the board is getting nerfed pretty much. It’s all additive on the PTS instead of multiplicative as it is on live servers, it’s just that bloodied is getting hit the worst (about a 50%-60% nerf).
---
Happened to me when I reinstalled the game as well :(
---
Are you on PS4? I don’t know about other platforms but if you’re on PS4 check your capture gallery, your screenshots will remain there
---
Sadly, I’m on Xbox.
---
The whole list of Season 2 is in a datamined album from the PTS. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i9t3zv/update_22_pts_atx_and_score/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
If Xbox have some sort of section where your saved clips and screenshots go to then I suggest checking it
---
The damage nerf is good. Everyone wanted a challenge, and now that they made EVERYTHING more challenging everyone is pissed. They just can’t satisfy these salty meta users can’t they?
---
Dont worry they will patch out been able to fit more than 2. This is a open world game, you cant do what you want or enjoy that would be anarchy. You must play how Bethesda has calculated too mean you are most likely to buy atoms.
---
So stealth melee builds are basically going to suck now?
---
If you are talking about the ammo card I’m looking forward to that - I think it is a better balance than what we have today... I have friends who spend entire gaming sessions farming flux/ lead/ then have to server hop to find enough acid to smelt the lead - it’s rough
---
Just saying that the armor skins look awesome and the new paints and camp items are looked forward to. You can’t have solid paints or camp items every single spot on the board. Having filler things is literally part of it. Deal with it and quit complaining about not picky shot. There’s worse things in this game that need more attention than your need for something other than rad away.
---
I completed it during double score week, without buying any levels. I grinded a LOT of line in the sand during double exp weekend, going from rank 51 to 82 during that time then getting the rest via double score weekend.
---
Possibly burnout. After I finished the season I just jump on to cash those treasury notes and hide in my camp hoping for sales while I play AC.
---
I’ve been unemployed since March 15th due to Covid and it’s been great catching up on collecting and grinding stuff but it got tiresome.
---
Hopefully once Meatweek comes back it’ll feel like home again.
---
Yeah they should make somwthing with that idea.
---
Any armor with the 15% Blocker effect will turn any shotty magical, even non-legendaries.
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
I heard someone say that so I put a couple up for 30k. I doesn't hurt to try.
---
Yes, I wish they would just buff every other build to its level. And yes he showed it that it was the overall game “balancing” damage
---
Oh, hi Prada -)) Well, right now Daily Ops gives SO much ammo in drops from mobs and from the event itself (and you can do it repeatedly as much as you want) so crafting may become redundant for many people with strong ammo-efficient builds if they keep the rewards intact.
---
For example I went in the pts with 6k flamer fuel and walked out after 3 events with 7.5k. And I didn't even bother collecting ammo from every mob killed, maybe from only 40-50%.
---
How does this affect a covert sneak better crit bloody mess tank killer rifleman?
---
Are sneak attack and crit still multiplicative? Is bloody mess additive now?
---
Which means more loot! (And lunch!)
---
I...want...Caravan!!!!
---
With the Cannibal perk, every food delivery is always buy one, get one free!
---
Yeah, 95% of my good gear I got via trade. I feel ya. Every time the SBQ gives me a rolling pin, I want to strangle Todd the God.
---
I like you.
---
If you were on PC I'd give you a ton. I am throwing steel away.
---
Vampire shotguns are great
---
That's a good suggestion.  It's like turning your toon in to Blade!
---
Sorry I'm a noob, but where/How can I get this?
---
It takes 2 shots to kill a level 75 super mutant and only a little bit more damage to kill a level 100, at max adrenaline you'd probably one shot most things. I ran the collosus event 2 times before and killed it in under 5 minutes both times, obviously the people on the PTS know how to play but it shouldn't be too different to SBQ after people are used to it. Kill sharing is easier for the most part which is nice. If those numbers are true it'd be nice to spend points on QOL stuff instead of damage for me.
---
Do you have all the regular plans and camp plans and the event plans?
---
Also faster and weigh more
---
Somebody’s been watching Mythic Quest.
---
Probably not the game for you
---
It’s not insta death. You have a bunch of ways to improve survivability and improve damage. Get lone wanderer, armor that revives it improves dr, doge chance when low hp, and ect. Berserkers is a glass cannon that still doesn’t compare to a standard weapon in terms of damage and risk.
---
Mmmmm....my bioshock boner is tingling
---
everybody gangsta till the mannequins start to walk like they did in skyrim and fo4 xd
---
Oh ffs, can they get any lazier
---
Dude, I get where you're coming from but in this situation you're missing the mark. Players didn't exploit any unintentional game defects, Bethesda simply didn't thoroughly think through the ramifications of the various gear/perk/buff synergies that feed into a character build optimized around a particular weapon property which resulted in a set of synergies that can be utilized by players to produce an outsized/unbalanced build. And, because of their lack of thoughtfulness, any player wishing to accept the playstyle imposed by these synergies, and willing to put in the effort to grind all the various RNG gear to make those synergies happen, ended up with a toon that out DPSes any other combinations tried thus far.   
---
I know it seems like everyone runs a bloodied build on forums like this, chock full of "power users" (or min/maxxers), but that's mostly because the entire fun of a game like this for a min/maxxer is finding and grinding the build and gear to support maximizing whatever capability has the most value in any given game. In FO76, that's damage output because there's literally no other stat-based alternative. Sure, you *could* min/max on Charisma or Intelligence, but there's not actual pragmatic value in doing so, so you min/max damage. It's a symptom of a poorly conceived game more than an unintentional property being exploited.
---
Necessary change. As many have said, multiplicative was dumb and broke any challenge the game had. Even as a AA build I was still doing a ton of damage to enemies. I’m happy Bloodied got toned down the most because it was frankly too strong no matter how one tries to justify its squishy nature, or lack thereof. 
---
This is a really good step in the right direction. Now if they can tone down unyielding so other armors can be buffed and included in more builds, then the game just might have something akin to a cohesive balance for once.
---
So pretty much nerfing the usable ones , making the already terrible one even worse.
---
Its sucky but I feel like if it were any bigger the game would probably melt itself lmao. I’m no coder but I feel like a good idea might be to have different containers available in your camp that act like a stash (nobody else can get things out of it) And have the regular stash as an important item container for easy access at stations &amp; survival tent... maybe. Don’t know how that would perform on the servers though but I do know that the current stash is crazy lagged.
---
This is a great comment - yeah if it makes the damage calcs simpler that could do a lot of good for the server stability and lag issues in complex fights ...
---
Yeah i was exaggerating a bit, but still you are significantly squishier than a full hp, especially if you go for sneak rifles. It just seems not worth it any more, maybe bloodied heavy guns tank would be good still but the benefit really just isnt there so much now. I feel like vampires might just be better most of the time
---
At least a rolling pin can be fun if it's got good perks. Wear the chef's hat, perk cannibal...
---
I had first for a month and now it's a pain to store so many things.
---
Duck tape (over the mouth) mod
---
Check whitespring shop and trainstation
---
I think it would be a fun little quest to get the ingredients so that Sunny could have ice cream for his new fridge. 
---
also make some other little quests based on what other residents of Foundation or the Crater say.
---
I buy serum recipes that I know; I also buy any rare plans in vendors (fixer, circus wagon, rare shielded, etc). Not sure why I keep selling stuff.
---
I'm completely burned out too, thinking about just buying my last ten ranks because I'm just over it. I'd love to just not play this game until actual content is added.
---
hey V :) 
---
yeah i noticed the same during the daily ops. pleasant surprise. even with ultracite ammo. but the ammo reward is just an example, in my opinion anything would be better than 5 radaways and i don‘t understand how some people refuse to see that. it‘s the pinnacle of laziness and i hope bethesda hears the feedback and decides to change it. 
---
the fact that people come here and comment that there are worse problems in this game that need adressing .. while that‘s true, it‘s also whataboutism at its finest. another problem does not make my problem less valid, lol.
---
Is that how you get them in order?  For season 2?
---
I’ve been buying mediocre Fixers from player vendors just to turnaround a put them in my vendors later for no particular reason. It works. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Yeah, I was just barely able to squeeze 4 mutfruit into the center and 4 corn into the corners. All depends on what you use and how you place it.
---
I know this is 3 months late, but did you ever figure out how to fix this?
---
They want to nerf weapons and scale enemies but will they fix anything that benefits the players? No? Vats? Still not fixed? The ghoul I shot that was 12feet away from me that still gave me a disease?
---
Im on ps4
---
I want to say I have roughly 90% of regular plans that you have to find and a good portion of event plans. I understand I may have to camp vendor hop if I want to buy them all. I mostly meant as far as default in game static capsinks
---
Looks like this is bugged again. I'm at the power armor and she's just glitched out and won't open the door so I can't continue. This is the second time it's happened. I switched servers once to try and reset her (having to start the entire chain from scratch) and it bugged out a second time at the same place.  
---
\^both times on private servers if that helps.
---
Yeah you can just be the asshole in front of the other assholes. That's how to society.
---
As long as there is a clear space to land and fight, she will
---
They should just refill the lake the flooded Charleston and make New Gad into a floating island to relax, gamble and bet. That and it might make building a camp around a full lake attractive
---
How is the timed difficulties? Do you need to do max damage to have a chance?
---
After all this time... Your finally roped back into new vegas. Just accept it bro.
---
Wait what? You have expendable caps?
---
I used to go to the Mountaineer every weekend back in like '07. Was there working on the power plant in Stratton. We never went to Wheeling Island though :(
---
You start hearing a beep when youre close then beeps faster the closer you get to it
---
yes there are worse problems in this game, problems that are already being adressed by the team. idk why you gotta come with that whataboutism. this is about the PTS and feedback. literally the entire purpose of the PTS. the PTS is not here to report the fast travel bug for the 100th time while knowing it‘s not going to be fixed anyway. the PTS purpose is to test the new changes and give feedback on stuff that‘s still open to change again. other problems don‘t make my problem less valid. i paid the same amount of cash for the game as the next person. if this particular problem doesn‘t bother you, cool, i’m honestly happy for you. but this is my feedback, because i‘m playing the PTS right now and it‘s not just one rank that gives 5 radaways, there are a lot more. A LOT of the players would rather have anything else, even lunchboxes.
---
And then after realizing we are being scammed just point the other guys at point blank with a fatman, sounds fun
---
People that are optimised for Damage dealing will have 0 issues imo. But the players already struggling ? I see it every day...lvl55 players getting raped by Mutants &amp; Scorched ...lvl 255 players struggling , Seen it both ingame are here on Reddit.
---
With Junkies weapons and full Health theres not much that can take me out but im pretty sure a very large chunk of the players are ones that play Fallout for the adventuring and so on.
---
Players that run 80% QoL perks for example will run out off ammo even more often.
---
My point being will these changes keep em playing or moving on ? 
---
We "optimised" players are not the only ones playing
---
I'm still ganking level 100 super mutants in under a second without a bloodied build, hell even on my pistol build I can still take them out in 1 shot.
---
From an IT perspective I can probably take a very good educated guess at this but you're going to hate the answer.
---
How about damage boost at night, DR boost during the day.
---
I have several characters with bloodied and one with berserkers. As berserkers with proper broken armor enhancing my stats and having optimal perk cards for damage and defense (but with no dr). Ranged sneak builds are still very very strong but instead will focus more heavily on min maxing with AR’s. Berserkers in the other hand is terribly hard to use throughout. Forces you to put a lot of time in it for literally no benefit when you can get a straight power up via any other effect. Any lvl enemy is a legit threat that can one or three shot you and when devoting yourself to a berserker build then you’re no longer able to enter a nuke zone. Until we get the legendary perks I haven’t been to a nuke zone in ages. There is no contest between berserkers and anything else.
---
Same here.
---
What does this have to do with dolls?
---
Four. 4 chances, exactly.
---
I mean, come on, 5 makes no sense, and 3 wouldn't make a lick of difference.  Obviously 4.
---
Depends.  I’d thenstuff will happen, but in its current state who knows.  
---
The fact damage changed could very well be an accident, trial balloon, intentional, way to make the game “harder”.  This is Bethesda anything can happen.
---
Ok Every vault dweller wants to complain about This Bug This Glitch This who give a crap Problem ....but no one Points out this one I know I'm overcumber with my scrap but when I die I drop It .....SO WHY THE HELL DO YOU SAY IM STILL OVERCUMBER WHEN I DROP SCAP WHEN I DIE????????? In return I can't. RESPONE WHERE I WANT?
---
When does this take effect? My bloodied damage hasnt changed yet
---
But we “optimized” players are the ones getting hit with the nerf. The nerf is affecting how damage is applied, it’s no longer multiplicative. Low levels who use a non legendary gun and just the damage perks won’t be affected by this. People like me using junkies, adrenaline, bloody mess, heavy gun perks, etc. will be hit the hardest. And guess what? I don’t mind, and neither should the other optimized builds. It’s finally something a bit more challenging than just spraying bullets for a second and having everything die. It’s the same reason I switched from JE to JFFR, the games too fucking easy
---
I think most of the whinging is coming from people either misunderstanding the change or, more likely, scanning the hot-take of "bloodied builds nerfed" at face value without reading on and then tossing their completely uninformed drama queen takes into the pile.
---
One time I had a VE mini gun, god that thing was great
---
It's not. A good bloodied build makes you a demigod with all of the stacking bonuses. This nerf only lowers the damage you deal, it doesn't even tackle any of the other issues like unyielding or serendipity, which were always the real reasons for why bloodied was so overpowered to begin with. Bloodied is still easily the top-tier effect, we had a post [earlier today](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i9u2lu/spoiler_pts_changes/) being able to kill a LEVEL 100 SHEEPSQUATCH with a single mag from a bloodied rifle. It's still hilariously overpowered in the PTS
---
You should probably read what the change actually is. It's not a "nerf" to "good builds".
---
Because what this game needs is more RNG.
---
This is a fucking horrible idea.
---
i hope that‘s the case, but i doubt it. this is how bethesda would‘ve released the season if we didn‘t have a PTS and i think we can all agree on that. it wouldn‘t be the first time and it surely won‘t be the last. that‘s why we have the PTS, for feedback. so bethesda can turn around and maybe say „oh, we totally didn‘t mean to give you radaway packs even tho the ranks all have designed icons just for the season, these are totally placeholders“.
---
Is that what's not working? Or others as well?
---
For anyone freaking out about the changes to damage output, remember that this is day one for a long-needed (though I wouldn’t say of the highest priority) update. Legendary perk cards were introduced a while back, have gone through several changes, and still aren’t in the regular game.
---
Sure, I’m going to miss how crazy a bloodied build can be, but no one should be killing the SBQ in less than a minute.
---
Rank one stops nocturnal from lowering during the day. Rank two locks you to always night. And a possible rank three would give you double benefits at night
---
that‘s not how they handled it for season 1 tho.
---
Where I belong!
---
Sorry it was supposed to say silly....my bad
---
*up to five.
---
I got that haul the same server I got my X-01 targeting HUD mod, and I had a teammate that happened to have a survival tent at the camp.  Completed five runs in just over 20 minutes for about 50 caps!
---
I paid for that karma, though.  Zero on a private server, twice today.
---
It’s proposed, currently unknown if it will *at all.*
---
Agree and disagree.  It won’t hurt unoptimized as bad, but it will force optimization that much more, or send people either more to melee or more to ammo farming than they already are, because things got even more bullet spongy.
---
I’m a-ok with this if it is part of a true weapon rebalance and more importantly weapon affix rebalance: the game sorely needs that.
---
Making the game harder because everything takes twice as many button pushes as before?  I don’t call that harder, it’s just, well, lazy.
---
Very frustrated with this as a new player. Glad I got this on gamepass and didn't pay a full 40$ for it, because from what I'm seeing, this game... really doesn't deserve that amount of money. Especially not with how hard they're trying to monetize it.
---
Just as I was about to post this, I tried again and got lucky (third day in a row) but it's ridiculous it got broken and their first priority wasn't hotfixing the game to make it right again.
---
I have so many tbonds at this point that I am angry that I can't turn in more at a time.
---
Its the guy on that icon using a pump!?
---
Wait, you guys have caps?
---
Unfortunately it's a later reward as its the only thing I want out of all of it.
---
How many shots should it take? 3-4 sounds reasonable considering it’s a pistol.
---
how do you get screaming eagle?
---
Im not saying berserkers doesnt need a buff, but i wasnt talking about that. Bloodied is obviously still the best damage effect, but i dont think damage effects are worth it really, apart from maybe junkies since it has basically no downside.
---
In live, by focusing my perks on sneak and damage, i can get my pipe revolver to headshot a super mutant for 3400 damage, before adrenaline or chems. On the pts that same revolver with the same build sneak headshots for 521. Thats barely over half their hp, and i die in probably 5 assault rifle shots, why would i run that over a heavy gun that has a similar time to kill, since i cant 1shot now, and the time between shots of pipe revolvers is fairly long (not crazy, but enough to be a bit annoying). The actual boost you get just ends up being so much less now. Its still the best, but its the best by a much smaller amount, compared to the minimal downsides of junkies, or even the healing of vampires.
---
I probably explained it badly idk
---
Neither Junkies nor Bloodied is decreased, stacking is.
---
Bloodied builds usually stacked more with Nerd Rage and Adrenal Reaction so will see a larger overall damage decrease but will still be ahead of Junkies.
---
That’s a player named handmade. Used on an atomic shop skin. Not sure if the skin is still available, I don’t believe it is.
---
ah but were the legendaries random or were they a unique weapon?
---
Just a question. How does the arrival of the BOS work together with the game's lore? Weren't they supposed to stay in their bunker for the next couple of years?
---
Good thing I didn't go bloodied, and have all my tse weapons still. I've got a bunch of them. I am glad they balanced things, placing me back on top
---
Random.
---
Is there a reason you are trying to be nasty to me as my original comment does not need this hostility you are showing
---
yes, can confirm those. have fun ranking to 93 for one (two if you count the BOS bunker) good reward(s).
---
Why are all of you griping about the dailies? I can usually get mine done within an hr or two usually. The only ones that give me any issues are finding a bobblehead, survive in the storm (nw), and kill x number of creatures (nw). I agree you shouldn't have to be doing them every day to keep up but people act like they take all day to do
---
Yes, Anti-Armor isn't in the stack so is significantly better in comparison than it was before.
---
What did I say that was hostile exactly ?
---
Triggers my autism. Make it 1000
---
Bottom left might do it for you my guy~
---
So it's additive then? Basically does the exact same as a rank 2 damage perk?
---
That's a good way to look at it.
---
Tons of tech data needed.  Best place is Military Wing of WS Bunker.  Next best is Control Rooms of Power Plants, followed by the top floor of Arktos.  Best I did was 12 in a day across all five locations.  I've probably done 70 and just yesterday unlocked Knight.
---
Welch has a ton of moleminers and some supermutants.
---
Of course they did, no scrapbox and only 400 weight meant space was at a premium.
---
Finally. It deserves it
---
I feel your pain, and in sorrow we are together.
---
Wow holy schnikes, thought for sure those would be ATX miss labels from the data mine. Thanks for the response.
---
I'm experiencing this as well. If anything, I'm reloading *slower* and I'm sure as hell not experiencing increased movement speed.
---
&gt;EVERYTHING was nerfed
---
Nothing was nerfed.  Damage stacking was fixed.  No other game uses multiplicative because it's idiotic.
---
This is an awful and unnecessary change. This hurts the actual players who utilize these damage buffs to have strong characters. The hackers with their god weapons are unaffected.
---
I totally agree with what you wrote in op, generic rewards like aid items are a little bit over the top to say the least. You don't even need to search for that stuff, it flows like a river if you just do events, wander around and occasionally (god forbid!) loot some mobs.
---
The season 2 overall does not seem very rewarding to me, I don't know whether I'll grind it away this time or not. All those filler rewards really could be something more substantial.
---
I think it’s fine to have that much, but everyone should be able to, not just subscribers. The fact that a subscription even exists while the game is still a buggy mess is beyond me, but that’s another story.
---
Grafton has a bunch of greenies

I kinda hate the fact that we know how it all ends. Maybe there is a huge plot twist where Nuclear winter was us in virtual pods or something.
---
So twisting somebody's comment to say they ate bitching just because you want to attack them is not being toxic?
---
Nice of them to have a pts for that then
---
It nerds everything. My berserker build is still not as good as bloodied, and worse than it was, and it was already hard. I like it for the challenge, but if it’s made harder then why stick with it if bloodied is hard too and does more damage
---
They’re not ready for that conversation
---
but with the addition of the fertilizer grenades you only need one to two types of a plant anyways.
---
I thought it was just me. I’m getting motion sickness from playing and have had to step away just in the past week.
---
During the sale I got a second account. That second account is my bank. I have about 3 characters, each dedicated to certain items. Then a third that afks and hosts my shop while I play on my main.
---
Despite having tons of weight reduction and offloading most of my stuff. I usually sit at around 100/300 on my character and 400/800 in my stash (w/ a junk stash) I can slim down to 300 if I really tried but you get the idea.
---
I fill up constantly....my banks are nearly maxed in stash and in character. I don't understand how you most players deal with it.
---
The mods that add fire damage give a little extra oomph to the laser weapons, and the heavy plasma weapons are in a good spot 
---
But yeah, some laser perks would be very welcome
---
It’s not twisting words and I’m not speaking about any one person. If you’re taking a generalization and applying it to yourself, that’s on you. 
---
None of this changes anything. Finishing the season isn’t a requirement nor is it a need. It’s unequivocally a want.
---
Bloodied needed this nerf. Bad. Outclassing every other build while being stupidly tanking is the antithesis of game balance. And no, buffing everything up to bloodied wouldn’t fix anything, it would have just compounded on the problem. 
---
Enemies needed to live longer, now hopefully they will. This is a step in the right direction IMO. As others have said, if you want high risk high reward, go play Berserkers.
---
What gun is that?  Looks like a ar-15 
---
Is it new to game?
---
i would have asked earlier but reddit was being a bitch, anyway how'd you get 4 legendaries on the weapon? most i can get is 3
---
It’s a prime receiver, and it’s not my picture.
---
They're making loadouts eventually, it is in the future updates with brotherhood of steel
---
Depends on what you want out of the game but my tip? Be very active in chat. It's how I met some awesome people. Events are the most fun I had leveling up.
---
The game is kind of a hot mess but it's still fun and the community is great
---
Nah these are good changes, the power gap between legendaries and normal weapons is way too much 
---
Legendaries should be stronger, but atm nothing in the game is a threat 
---
Damage across the board needed to be nerfed imo
---
Liquor and whores
---
Cigarettes and dope and mustard and baloney
---
Being able to break the ‘aid’ category down into food, drink, chems, healing, bobbleheads, and magazines should not be understated.  Same thing being able to find an unread Plan in my ‘notes’ stash without having to scroll through hundreds of other things.
---
Wow that's amazing, thanks for telling me. Link by any chance?
---
100% agree
---
I thought the rewards couldn't get any worse than the first season but I stand corrected. I'm actually happy tho because it means I can take a break without missing any good shit.
---
Yeah I’m quite upset. I feel like it works 1 in 15 times I load into a world. Then if I fast travel it goes away
---
This is a bug fix.  No game uses multiplicative because it's idiotic.
---
Eventually caps become "worthless" and you're forced to get into trading. You need to buy decent weapons and armor you can find in other vendors. Buy/farm flux. Pretty much anything with value that you can bring to a trade table.
---
You can eventually trade for just about anything.
---
I am so sick of hearing “How NOW brown cow” 😅
---
Ooh yeah.  Bring on the Macho Scorchbeast Queen, yeah!
---
this time i would‘ve preferred the greenhouse and bunker to be ATX so i don‘t have to grind this flop of a season for them, but welp. itiswhatitis. np :)
---
Its a step in the right direction that's for fucking sure I'm actually really excited about this
---
They are nerfing weapons.
---
It’s not by a small margin of an increase it’s best by far. You have adrenal reaction which is a base boost, bloodied which by itself is a 2x modifier while everything is 1.5, and nerd rage giving an additional amount (don’t get me started on mele unyielding which gives strength and allows you to deal insane damage). It hasn’t been mean this 2x diff is unbelievable (even though that’s an issue as well), the real problem is every single thing being based on hp status stacking over and over making people literally deal infinite damage and still having great survivability compared to the most squishy build. There is only ONE enemy with armor pen and several with poison. However, you will one shot literally anything so it’s not an issue.
---
Its not a generalization your words are there clear as day as your reply to my comment please leave me alone you dont know me and your attempt to assume you know me or know how I think is ridiculous and you get all of this from my few lines replying to somebody's post
---
Leave me alone unless you can act civil I'm not here to get into a debate with a troll
---
Bloodied will still be good, but instead of doing 1000 gauss damage now it will do 600. Basically there is a less of a gap between best and subpar, making multiple builds AT LEAST comparable,
---
Would you feel good if your favorite build was 200 damage points apart from the most powerful, or 20 points of damage apart?(non automatic)
---
Getting the same issue here! Any idea how long these bugs typically go on for? I could do some side quests. I know there is a glitch to getting to the other side of doors with putting your power armor on in an elevated position, hopefully I can remember it.
---
Edit, nope, just popped me out on the other side of the building.
---
I am at max level and was going to be moving on to a game sooner or later and I guess it's sooner. About time I gave Witcher 3 another shot. I was a few hours in a few years ago and tried it again but forgot the plot setup, I should just start over.
---
I’m sorry if the truth hurts your feelings. I don’t know what you want me to tell you lol.
---
I had forgotten all about you til you just relied....

Ammo farming is made much easier with legendary perks. Just swap in the 50% more ammo perk when crafting, even if it’s not upgraded
---
In other words, it was amazing
---
You are at the awkward levels right now. Stick to the Forrest, Toxic Valley and Ash Heap until your 30s, at least. Then hit the Savage Divide. Save the Mire and Cranberry Bog until 40-50.
---
For food, focus on pre-packed. It doesn't spoil. Use the Can Do perk in Luck and sweep every garbage can you can find (Whitesprings and Wavy Willard's are good spots to farm).
---
It will get better. Just give it time.

What are caps?
---
I'm guessing the rad kits will be replacing atoms for the rewards next season?  And, given that their new content, if it ever gets released, will happen to take place in irradiated enclosed spaces, I'm sure they'll be for sale in the atom store as well, along with the other exciting prizes like the scrap kits that I haven't even claimed.
---
Yeah and you see posts about people helping out others and having a really good time and that’s never happened to me. I’m leve 125.

“Daily limit of one spin per day”- God Howard
---
indeed. if we didn‘t have the PTS we would probably still have bugs that allow players to steal your entire inventory and stuff. we‘d have legendary perks that are an absolute letdown and we would never have enough coins to rank them up. i‘m thankful for the PTS and bethesda listening to feedback once in a while, i‘m not thankful for the always same people in this sub who like to belittle the problems of others simply because it doesn‘t concern them. but now i‘m ranting, sorry :D
---
Said it before...its kind of a shame players have much better ideas than the ones making it 😁
---
SOMEONE GET TODD
---
You’re ok
---
I set up camp on a steel node (fills up to 20 before it needs emptied) and just run around collecting and scrapping everything. I have FO1st so stash size isn’t an issue for me, though.
---
I notice it breaks if I get into and then leave power armor but after that a weapon swap fixes it.
---
No don't tell them. Let them scorch.
---
Its only the most popular drink in Appalachia. You'll never know which 76er's blood it is but that's half the fun. Sharing is caring.

I list Serums for 100 (and that’s all serums) and it’s been sitting in my vendor for about 1 1/2 weeks. And my fusion cores at 25 and they’ve been there about a week.

no, atoms are still up as a reward. i think the same 1500. meh.

i don‘t think they would go as far as selling radaways on the atom shop, but you never know. lunchboxes are definitely coming.

I posted this here in hopes they'd see it and know that I was thankful for them being nice!
---
Bad players(or players without any resources to get bloodied gear. same garbage tbh)cried about “nerf bloodied” - got nerf to everything. At least 1 thing makes me fun - bad players suck now and will suck after nerf and gonna keep cry. :)
---
Alright I'm ready to move camp so I'll just move up there and see what's up
---
My camps at a random assault encounter,  I usually gain extra rep by rescuing raider or settlers from a pack of mobs, then kill them after for extra loot. 
---
They don't fight back once you're friendly.
---
Thats fine with me man. Game needed a big shake up. Ive been collecting virtuall everybhandgun roll for months in preperation
---
As a bloodied build, it’ll be nice to have more of a challenge!
---
Its a material not a color. He can feel it.
---
Nail on the head. Balancing is good and needed. But can we also tune the HP of enemies to be reasonable? And fix the bugs that allow for one shots?
---
Well if he’s blind he can’t see color. He can however feel the corduroy texture.
---
I seen a couple people talking about it/showing it off during the last PTS.
---
I’ll tAkE yOuR eNTIre STOck!!!!!
---
Armor and weapon plans will have just what it is as the plan name, i.e.: heavy combat limbs or sturdy leather chest. 
---
Mods will always be listed before the armor piece, i.e.: pocketed combat limbs or pneumatic metal chest. 
---
The mod plans can be applied across all types of an armor class. So for combat, metal and robot armor you have lightweight, sturdy and heavy classes. You’ll need the plans for each class/limb/chest to craft each. However the plans for the mods like strengthened, deep pocketed, aerodynamic, etc can be applied to all classes. So you won’t find a plan exclusively for deep pocketed heavy combat limbs or aerodynamic light metal arms. It’ll just be deep pocket combat limbs, aerodynamic metal arms.
---
Loving the new adjustments
---
Yeah I have to unequip then re-equip my weapon to get the speed increase.
---
I don't hate the limit as much as most players do. I don't have 1st and usually start every play session with give or take 100 extra on my person and 100 extra in my stash. At the end of each play session I try to have 3 3* weapons and 2 2* weapons to trade In for scrip the next day. Everything else gets sold in my vendors for CHEAP or to the robot vendors. If it's a really good weapon I'll store it in my mule that honestly only has about 20 weapons that I couldn't bring myself to get rid of. I have a pretty good grasp of what I will need to keep rolling for better secret service armor and make the ammo I need so everything else also gets sold or dropped at the overseers camp if I see a new player near there. Endgame players like me don't need to keep mats to repair anything because of the repair kits that you get from doing the sbq. If you don't feel the need to hoard everything you can possibly pick up the stash limits really aren't that hard to manage.
---
I used to not use PA but I recently started. If I use PA does that mean I’m screwed?
---
Oh okay good to know. Does it have anything to do with PA?
---
There is currently a mod called "perk load outs" and it's everything you could possibly want.
---
Path of exile uses multiplicative modifiers
---
Bethesda really needs to fix their lighting, or the way metal textures look, maybe even both.
---
That image of the fridge and stove in the room with the shiny tiles and metal walls looks fucking awful.  I really can't even find myself to use politer words to voice my criticism on this one, because it seriously just looks *that bad*.  I don't know what it is they had to change in Fallout 76 from Fallout 4, but seriously, reflective surfaces look awful in like every lighting situation, and it's high time they made an effort to change it.
---
Curious how you acquire the plans for this?
---
Every now and again, if one or three people hit Jackpot within thirty minutes of each other, PVP is enabled strictly inside the casino and you can kill them for the caps and they have to get outside the boundaries of the building to be safe.
---
You dont 1 shot anything in pts though. I just said my 3400 per shot revolver went to 500 per shot, thats half their health bar.
---
Currently bloodied is a 1.95x multiplier, which is stupid crazy good. On pts it just adds .95 to all your other multipliers. Sure you might end up with double the damage compared to a full hp junkies build, but it still gets 60% from perks and 50% from junkies for at least 110% more dmg. Bloodied gets 60(perks)+95(bloodied)+50(adrenal)+20(nerd rage) for 225%. Its obviously still way better, but its less way better than before. If you include sneak and headshot multipliers suddenly the gap is a lot less, since, at least in my testing, those seem to be addative now also. With 2.5x sneak damage from the perk junkies sneak headshots are doing 360%, bloodied is doing 475%. Thats suddenly not a huge difference. Only 1/4 more damage for a bloodied compared to full hp junkies.
---
I might be wrong about those sneak numbers, but my pistol on pts has about 300 listed damage in pip boy (slightly higher), but only headshots for 521, with 2.5x sneak damage perk thats should be waaaaaaay higher if it was working normally (1500ish, since itd be about 5x more like it is in live)
---
Speaking as someone whos got 1300 hours in game, and about 1000 of them as sneak pistol/rifle, if you get detected you die. Maybe thats less squishy than berserkers sure but its still pretty damn squishy. Just because i die in 2 shots not 1 doesnt really mean its good.
---
If you think I won't fight someone to get an Animatronic Clown, you're dead wrong, Pal.
---
Maybe I dunno. I try to reserve PA use for tougher events, maybe its the in and out that angers the speed demon.
---
You should probably read the thread. It's pretty evident that you only read the clickbait thread title and made a whole set of assumptions without a shred of basis in fact.
---
You don't run your fucking game this way for almost 2 years and decide to change it all of a sudden. This isn't the proper way to do it.
---
How will instigating be affected by this change?
---
*Nods silently*

Nice joy boy moment

If you are playing on xbox one you hit me up(Deliciou5) and join my world, i built a camp to be newb friendly where you get free whiskey and left all the nodes open for looting.

Got a junk,lead,water purifier,crops,and collectitron you can all loot! I also sell all my ammo/newbie plans for super cheap!
---
I really only experience the reload slowing down when I swap from a melee weapon to a ranged weapon. Another thing that’s been talked about is needing to un-equip and re-equip class freak if you’re running that card.

Ah sorry qwq I play on PC, thank you so much for the offer though!!

That’s understandable. I just hope Beth fixes it eventually

Put every single legendary I have inside vendors for real cheap in order to remove some weight issues made 14k caps lost 200lbs did encryted, and sbq 3 times after and at max weight again.. my mule is sitting at 400lbs my 242 is maxed and my 255 is maxed

I use a controller because I’m old.

I help out players all the time! However a lot of content is too easy to outside of boss battles, i think the one wasteland update is going to be huge for group gameplay since everything will be harder for all players encouraging cooperation.
---
What point do you get the bunker?
---
Getting gradually better and smarter is one of the joys of the game. I fondly remember what you are describing, now it’s “do I really want to burn ammo fighting his creature? Naw, I’ll go around” with almost no fear
---
Don't park to close or they won't spawn. But the still kind of do. I'm on a spawn spot on a cliff. The spawns happen a lot when other people travel there and so much when I do. I get the leftovers. :( But I have some double sided walls and refuse to move now.
---
No just equip the perk and youll just start hearing a funny beep. Then start searching. Same with caps and magazine finding perks too
---
Does the tank killer perk effect laser pistols or just kinetic pistols?
---
ah man :(
---
Take another downvote since it's what people are doing lol sorry mate
---
Grafton steel, grafton dam, Welch, black water mine, anywhere in the ash heap and savage divide for raiders as they’ve taken over a lot of the spots. Look for the blood eagle icons in particular.
---
I assume it works for in game chat, but it definitely works for party chat. My friends and I party up and play and I can hear them through the tv/surround system and the microphone on the Kinect picks up my voice. Microsoft dropped support for the Kinect device but it still functions. This is probably the only thing it does right.
---
IT's okay! I love helping new players out i see them all the time on xbox since they added fallout 76 to gamepass.
---
[Here is a good resource.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bsyukf/new_map_of_random_encounter_locations_found_by/)
---
Makes sense. That’s why they nerfed it by 20% to fix it. 
---
2+2=5*.8
---
It's happened to me and I know I did the damage. Sometimes I get just queen loot and no event rewards, sometimes I get just event rewards, sometimes I get nothing. I mean most of the time it's fine and a normal event. But other times I definitely don't get what I should at the end.
---
Okay I’ll do that!
---
What do you mean, this game only has features! It just works. 
---
I mean, *16 times the detail!*
---
It looks like it was meant to be some sort of Air Force armor but then they decided they were going to put in the Secret Service so just called it Secret Service armor.
---
Yeah, id say add em in a bunch of major places, maybe keep scrip to train stations, and even more so see if we can move it to a robot vendor beyond a machine for immersion.
---
It would be fun to setup a driving range in CAMP and kill attackers with exploding golf balls.
---
Forgot to mention that just swapping between two ranged weapons seems to fix it most of the time. For the reload speed at least. So if notice I’m reloading really slow, I’ll swap guns and swap back again and it fixes it. As far as running goes, I got nuthin.
---
While I think the nerf was warranted to an extent, they need to rethink %’s if everything is going to be based on a flat number now. It doesn’t make much sense that TS remain unphased, or in a better state when Junkie’s, berserkers, and bloodieds all have to sacrifice something important to get the necessary stat buffs to their build. At the least, prefixes that belong to a specific build type should be stronger as it requires a lvl of commitment to creating your character that way. Meanwhile TS can be used by any build without any need to sacrifice one’s stats-albeit some weapons work much better than others. 
---
And melee builds will just be useless if these changes aren’t thought over more before release
---
That's pretty much the MO for much of humanity, see the oil industry, or big tobacco.
---
Lol good going hacker!
---
As a web developer I have a general understanding how something seemingly unrelated breaks something else and it's frustrating as hell.
---
Is there some channel that we can check for when this but gets resolved? I would rather not go back and try the door every few days, especially if it takes weeks to fix.
---
That's a much better idea. I hadn't checked to see if I could. Thank you
---
It's pretty common on xbox, kinda like a pay it forward comunitee on my second character I was doing my thing leveling and what not a level 100 showed up gave me a butt load of ammo and a few guns and took off, later during fasnacht some1 nuked the area and i kept dying and a level 70 something gave me a rad suit. So for awhile I was crafting sets of armor, a few weapons some ammo and what not some clothes you cant get anymore the Insurgent as well as the treasure hunter and chasing new players around. It was all well and good till I gave 1 I took under my wing a furious faster fire rate plasma gat and they turned around and sold it for 100 caps
---
Yep, unless you see something in a vendor for cheap that you can use.   Many events reward or have a few legendary enemies that drop them.   Relax, explore, level up etc and worry about finding the right legendary, build, etc after 50.
---
I’ve went for pistol builds before but their only saving grace is damage per shot. In this game pistols do poor dps when compared to other weapons even though bloodied increases it’s damage significantly. Rifles will still have bloodied as their to go choice but the meta has always been legacies and bloodied for pve since the damage increase is insane. The new PTS lowers everything’s damage but still having the best option is best and that’ll still be bloodied. You only lost out a good chunk of damage but still have a lot of survivability. I also brought out the point of berserkers since it’s really hard to set up a proper endgame berserkers viable build while bloodied can use pretty much any perk card and armor for the occasion. All in all using a pistol is meh dps wise and doesn’t do well in groups.
---
Dammit just when I figured out how to do even slightly decent melee damage I'm gonna go back to having to TRY again? Man I know this isn't supposed to be a relaxing game but I'm so used to just chillin' and cruising thru on very easy mode in the other fallout games
---
I'll report this one. Thanks everyone!
---
That is ideal for your first character. You can join events or vendor hop for gear at lower levels.
---
All weapons took a significant hit, certain melee weapons will actually be more powerful and balanced than before since melee has a higher base overall and weapons that were powerful because of other factors now can't boost their damage in the same way as before.
---
So how it used to work would be that it multiplies dmg numbers repeatedly,(45&gt;49.7&gt;98.2&gt;324.2&gt;684.2&gt;etc.) so you would get boosts into the hundreds through multiplying effects.
---
NOW it boosts your damage based on the base damage instead of multiplying the new number. So each  20% boost off of 45 base damage will now give you 4-5 points of damage, whereas before you get HUNDREDS since the new base damage was used for each boost.
---
So melee gets more benefit from boosts because all damage boosts are actually based on base damage of weapon, so the higher the base damage the better the boost. So 2 handed melee is getting major upgrades. Not that it needed it in comparison to other melee weapons.lol
---
Rose would be a crazy, maniacal, perfect casino owner

I like this very much.
---
I was assuming that the Fallout Shelters would be big open chasms you can build normally in. Maybe not on the scale of the one in Fallout 4, but a similar idea.
---
Are there Vault Walls/Floors/Assets as well now, too?
---
They should add poker tables
---
It depends. If you can find a 1* or 2* low level legendary weapon for cheap, then go for it because it’ll make playing the game easier. But don’t invest In expensive meta weapons or overall 3* weapons with good rolls unless they are level 45-50
---
What the actual hell.. Why would they do this... They would ruin the fun... I stopped playing neverwinter and the division because of damage sponges... The enemies freaking hurt.. this is stupid.

FILL YOUR CRAVINGS AT THE CIRCUS OF VALUES
---
You can buy all the Bow Plans, I guess. Foundation and Crater Vendors have them. Otherwise you can just buy Bulk Junk that you find yourself short on.
---
Grind levels, buy atoms, spend atoms to progress on the board.
---
Well then, guess I need to do some extra hunting when they invade.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Long_pew
---
Yeah that's fair, maybe I was just overreacting, but what about other weak melee weapons like the shishkebab or machete? Cause all melee weapons paled in comparison to the powerfist, will this make the power fist more stronger or balanced?
---
It's probably going to be the same rate as it is currently.
---
The hyper rates on PTS are just to make sure the progression works.
---
I think it's level 80 something? and you only have 3 weeks worth of weeklies/dailies left.
---
I mean, it's possible if you spend the next 3 weeks grinding like your life depends on it. as each 10k experience is worth 100 score. but based on the weeklies and dailies alone, no.
---
or you could just pay for it I guess.
---
I didn't see any.
---
From level 1 not likely. Make a new character for leveling up and repeat that even the 10k xp is a grind for only 100 score. So youll have to use atoms for the coop. It only provides fertilizer.
---
No idea. We’re going to find out.
---
Following up on what a couple people said already. I’m new to the game, level 42. I found it very useful to level up quick, find a way to make a lot of caps, and go player vendor hopping to buy legendary items. I have found the higher the player ranking vendor the cheaper items seem to be listed. So much so I now tend to buy cheap legendary items from these vendors to exchange for scrip. i have 500 scrip doing this and event hopping as well.
---
I can accept a nerf to an extent, but this one is frustrating. I’ve spent 60 something levels messing around with getting my bloodied right and despite what non-bloodied keep saying I still lose constantly - the last patch that fixed the magic healing glitch made sure of that. Like others said, if they want bloodied to stop being the best it should have been bringing us all closer together not dropping bloodieds down. 
---
I’m gonna wait it out and see what actually gets released but if this goes live I’m wasting tons of perk points just to fix my build. And now i’m sure my bloodied gear has already dropped like a rock in value. Gonna try to stay positive, the devs all run bloodied builds so maybe once they notice how useless a glass BB gun is they’ll bring our dmg back up and put more work into how this additive system changes pretty much every item in the game...
---
Oh I fully expect it to be the same as now minus the added dailies. Just hoping they maybe double the gain so its more forgiving when the season goes live.
---
Does the Vault Generator have a built-in-base still, or have they changed it from 4?
---
Is that the story how they went to Chicago and crashed there? Or is that the plot line of tactics?
---
When you're calling something that has been in the game for almost 2 years a exploit I can't take you seriously.
---
Some clues here in case anyone else has issue, gonna attempt dx9 😂 https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/3766
---
I'm pretty happy with my VE 10mm smg the way it is.  Rapid heal.
---
I can agree to that. I shoulda been clear i meant from specifically a non auto rifle / pistol perspective, since they play about the same, in that your whole goal is to 1 shot anything you see, dps is not your focus (so not great at queens), and this change makes it so you cant do that, basically making the build redundant. Bloodied is yeah still goto for sneak auto rifles, im just salty bcs i really enjoyed sneak pistol / rifle. (Im using pipe revolver, gamma gun(that has over 900 listed damage not including radiation, and hits for less than the 600 listed damage of the pipe revolverbcs idk thanks game), and a radium) i just have a lot of fun with my build and the fact that it just doesnt work at all now is annoying as hell.
---
If I were you I'd do all the dailies and weeklies until the last day of the season and just buy the rest of the ranks since the higher ranks require more score to obtain.
---
Sounds fun!  Welcome to the wastelands.
---
Honestly, every Faction should have a Collectron, for people that associate with them. Raiders have one and the Brotherhood is getting one.
---
We still need a Responders, Fire Breathers, Free States, and Enclave Protectron. Possibly a Foundation and Secret Service one as well. The real dilemma is picking what they collect.
---
I would also like a Nukatron, possibly using the skin from Nuka-World in Fallout 4, that collects Nuka-Colas.
---
This.
---
Yes, thank you devs. Been hoping for this since beta.
---
Go ahead and downvote me all you want, but this will actually balance the game. Bloodied will still be superpowerfull, but not overly powerful.
---
Well all weapons will be closer to each other now since the gains will be smaller, so it's a start. There won't be as bad of a build gap between best and subpar.
---
So what you’re saying is Bethesda is fucking up their own game even more.. huh. Who would’ve thought, they’ve never done that in the past
---
Int is nerfed for XP multipliers?
---
This is true I as well have lived right behind the church since the BETA. Didn't think about the potential of my CAMP being trashed.
---
Yes, it has the same base (if I remember correctly), which looks like it connects to other floor pieces just like in 4.
---
Too many variables? X,y,z
---
A cube also has a center point.
---
We use square foundation and flooring with a snap to grid building system but inside a sphere to waste lots of ground
---
Yeah it wouldn't hurt to boost them. Maybe not DOUBLE, but a little more wouldn't hurt.
---
I'm at 91 now, having only skipped the NW Dailies that require killing Players, and only earning the 10,000 exp as many times as it took to earn a level that day. At this rate, I'll finish next Thursday, when the Double Dailies start.
---
God i wish they would buff them. My plasma rifle does ok but i got an allmost perfect ultracite laser rifle roll for my commando but they suck so hard I can’t use it in higher level areas. Not when my handmade wrecks everything in sight. 
---
But out of curiosity are you just speculating on a future legendary effect nerf or have they actually said it a sure thing? If so what legendary effects did they mention ? Not trying to be rude this is just the first iv heard of a legendary effects nerf.
---
Grafton dam has super mutants that respawn fairly often.
---
So how do I upvote this to infinity?
---
It depends on if you're someone that grinds and can level up fast or if you take your time and are slower to level up. Legendaries are very easy to come by once your higher level so its not really a waste of scrip. I'd just try to get something fun now rather then wait but that's just me.
---
I've actually made a good few friends just from being stupid. I'd get bored and then follow people around at their camps or go into game chat and "stalk" people and pretend I'm voicing a documentary. There's plenty of people out their try many of the discord servers or check Twitter there's plenty to try besides the lfgs. God's speed.
---
Ppl shouldn't kill the messengers.
---
I'm dragging my ass on the legendary run. Don't play as much as I used to either. Not sure if it's the legendary run or not. Just kinda bored running around repairing things and trying to replenish the ammo I never seem to have enough of. Idk there's a lot more to keep track of in this game than the other fallout games.
---
Definitely love a lot of things about this game but I have been kinda bored with it and tired of all the organizing and repairing and grinding for everything from food to script all the time. Not too much to enjoy in this game but a whole lot of shit to keep up on. It seems unbalanced if that makes sense.
---
Well Thank God we get so many Hunters Rolling Pins and Nocturnal Pipe Guns
---
However, Legend cards allow you to buff some SPECIAL stats allowing you to potentially add more +dmg perk cards to your build as I understand it.
---
No thanks
---
A screaming eagle skin for the fixer you can get from the atom shop?
---
I’m at level 60, waiting for the last two days to drop my stockpile of atoms on.
---
Awesome.
---
But Rad away?
---
I’ve got ass loads of that.
---
Exactly...
---
The place that was Wheeling Downs? they'd have to map out another section north past the toxic valley for that though, or else make it one of their expedition locations.
---
Dog tags are already in the game at some old outposts from the Appalachian chapter
---
30,000 is the Cap limit, mate. Why the urge to get that much?
---
I can help you. Find marine tactical helmet plan. Make around 30-50 and sell to vendor for 1400 caps a day. Dont pay real money ever 🍺
---
I just found one, yay!
---
I always try to run up and just bop it with my gun so other people can take a shot too. It’s worked out pretty well when joining the event with other people not on my team, too, thankfully.
---
I don’t know bro, I am just trying to get enough caps for settlement stuff I guess.
---
Do they really sell for that much??
---
How many camp items and skins does it have compared to s1?
---
If I don’t get any weapon skins and armor skins, outfits etc I don’t think I can justify logging everyday
---
GIVE US AN AMMO BOX and things will be fine, and reduce the weight on chems/food like why is every food item 1lb
---
I think it is fine. With proper management and not hoarding everything you get, I have little trouble keeping my stash below limits. Keep a few weapons and armor, 150 of junk you use regularly and 50 of stuff you rarely need, and it’s not hard. Don’t store chems and crap and smelt all your ore as it weighs less,etc. 
---
It’s doesn’t matter what is was at launch or yesterday...either way people will complain it is not enough. 
---
People hoard weapons and armor they do not use and never in the hopes of scripting it or trading it or have 1000s or pounds of junk and wonder why they cant add anything. 🙄. 
---
If you pick up that much stuff scrap what you can and sell the rest or just drop the 💩. If you don’t want it chances are others do not either. 
---
I think the stash limits hep to keep the game level as too much and there wouldn’t be enough stuff moving around the game, IMO. But I know I am in the minority, at least on this site. LoL.
---
30 caps each depending on hard bargain and charisma. minimal junk edit: super duper ;)
---
Mr. House was still around too. We could maybe see some story about the platinum chip even. Idk just spit balling it would a dope way to nod to NV tho
---
I just used double since it felt like it would let people miss a week or whatever and still be golden. Im at 85 myself with using an alt for levels on days I felt too lazy to level on my main so I know I'll be finishing early, but I'd still like the grind to be easier. Just not pts easy as I'd actually hate that despite how much I want the damn beer steins.
---
Source? Last i heard mod support was a very long while away.
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
I feel like the queen will still be able to be killed in less than 3 mins. Especially after seeing her killed in 41 seconds with no adrenaline. Noob’s Damage went from 130-170 with the commando perks in the PTS. Add 3.5/3.75x sneak Damage, tenderizer being multiplicative, adrenaline. Plus the legendary sneak perk. You could definitely still get a good time. I just wish they went a different route. Especially since playing fo76 on console made me switch to PC because of the frame rate drawing back Damage output already.
---
“It just works....”
---
All you have to do is look up other posts asking this same thing. It’s very different establishing a radius that goes the same distance in all direction vs a cube with the landscape. It has a harder time handling elevations shifts and other objects that would more or less require devs to manually address each landscape based on that parameter. If it was as simple as changing from sphere to cube it most likely would’ve happened by now.
---
Except in this case it made the game bearable to play. If we're going back to the days of 20+ bullets for 1 kill, then we'll see an exodus greater than the builders.
---
Buy what on eBay? Weapons?
---
I agree. Although we are in the minority for sure. Bloodied builds shouldn’t have the ability to do so much damage compared to the rest.
---
Uhm One Wasteland kind of is the combat rebalancing.
---
I thought charisma stats and hard bargain didn't effect player vendors. And I'm just wondering I feel like I'm under selling my items. As I sell mostly bulk junk at 35 caps a bulk
---
Eh GTA was able to do it pretty easily. All that happened was the casino element was restricted in countries where online gambling was illegal.
---
No you sell to robot vendors at train stations. Every day you can get 1400 caps from them.
---
What settlement stuff? You mean plans?
---
It doesn't take rocket appliances to see where this is going.
---
That area wasn't a settlement iirc, but a good idea nonetheless
---
My bad. I misunderstood
---
What are the differences between the two?
---
All good op was talkin about ebay i had to say something haha 🤙🏻
---
Pts has a current nerf since they are changing the way they do damage calculation so everything is loosing damage if it has a multiplier
---
Just get rid of the debuff on it. During the day, nocturnal gear is worse than the vanilla counterparts. Get rid of this mechanic, and make it so that it's normal during the day, and buffed at night.
---
In contrast, bloodied weapons don't get super weak when you're at full health, - they just return to normal damage. Nocturnal weapons should function the same way. It's silly having a daytime debuff on it.
---
You can sell purified water to the robots that's how I get part of my money.
---
Ah, do you mean Atoms for the Atomic Shop, because unless your buying the resources from vendors or players shops surly you can scavenge the materials for settlement items while your playing?
---
A settler is just one bad day away from going raider, save yourself the trouble next week and just kill em today.
---
That would make certainly make them more viable. However, currently I'm finding them very useful. My V33VATS Minigun is crazy good but my V50LIMB Pump Shotgun is also (and one shots muties). Also, for f'ing around and conserving ammo, I can kill the muties in one hit from my level 40 VE Harpoon Gun with the flechettes mod. My HP jumps by like 20-30% with each firing of that weapon due to the multiple explosive projectiles. It's kind of comical when I shoot something right in front of me and I get shoved by several feet from the force.
---
Yes plans like antique chairs, couches from the resort resort furniture and brick an contemporary house plans
---
Yeah that’s true. Don’t get me wrong I’d love this but I feel like there would be some legal complications. Banning it in some countries would work though
---
Caps dear
---
Imagine that with a fatman, if you dont die you will go from 100% to even 1% then to 100% (I mean you should include the damage done to everyone, even you xd)
---
Be active in chat? I wish xbox one had a chat box mod, right now you can only xbox message them or use a mic. I don't always feel like talking, in fact most people i see don't have a mic.

This is really needed game was really easy at a certain level.
---
&gt; They are hard to find in shops 🙁
---
Man it's so weird how different people can be playing the same game and have wildly different experiences.
---
I see Fixer plans in nearly every vendor I come across. The downside of this is that the plans don't sell ...because everyone knows the plan already.
---
I myself have had a couple of Fixer plans in my vendor for several weeks, and they just don't sell.
---
&gt;Literally all the evidence they provided was a "trust me bro, it's bad." So yeah, for all the other factions knew, they weren't, hence "pretense."
---
The Sorched were widely known to be an actual threat; the Scorchbeasts devastated Harpers Ferry early on, and while the Brotherhood were able to contain the worst, the Responders still knew about the Scorched.
---
&gt;Also, I wouldn't say the Brotherhood was the only faction fighting the Scorched. That devalues The Firebreathers and the vaccine the Responders created as well as the Free States' tech wizardry to actually contain them.
---
I don't think the Fire Breathers had much value to begin with, honestly.
---
&gt;Both of those factions were far closer to beating the Scorched than the Brotherhood and they didn't even have a warning.
---
&gt;The Brotherhood's last attempt to beat the Scorched was going to be what we tried - a nuke on the Prime Site - and that clearly didn't work. Meanwhile if the Responders had literally a couple more days the main threat of the Scorched - their disease - would be eradicated, which would allow the Firebreathers to continue their fight - which was just as effective as the Brotherhood's. And the same goes for the Free States - a little more time and they'd have been able to set up the pylons that would act as Scorched magnets, which would've prevented them from spreading, and then they could've finished their deterrents, which from the sound of it would've made Scorchbeasts nearly harmless when combined with the attractors.
---
You're making a lot of (very generous) assumptions here. While the vaccine was certainly important, it alone wouldn't stop the Scorched, merely hinder the plague in the local area. The Scorched detection system and accompanying gadgets would have been handy, but it wouldn't have completely neutralized the Scorchbeasts as a threat.
---
Calling the Fire Breathers as effective as the Brotherhood is... dubious. Operation Touchdown saw the Brotherhood killing multiple scorchbeasts and a Scorched Mirelurk Queen in a single prolonged engagement, and ultimately resulted in clear skies for months. The most action the Firebreathers ever saw was fighting Scorched in mines - and they lost.
---
Moreover, neither the Free States nor the Responders would have ever gotten close to their goals if the Brotherhood hadn't been containing the Scorched for years.
---
&gt;Of course, if you meant "at the time", then that's even more laughable because that was their own choice. It's not like they bothered to actually tell anyone about it; bit hard to fight against the Scorched when literally the only thing you know about them is that the Brotherhood are robbing you to fight "something bad".
---
Both the Responders and the Free States were well aware of the Scorched for years before the Brotherhood fell. It wasn't a secret.
---
All three groups let pride and mistrust of others get in the way of stopping the Scorched. Was the Brotherhood sometimes offensive or coercive? Yes. Is that a good reason to *not* share information and supplies with them? Of course not.
---
Ahh screw the whole thing.
---
I’m still gonna play but tbch I won’t play every day. Maybe every other day. I still have stuff I want to do, weapons to try, trades to to etc. 
---
I just hit 82 or 83. I’m havin fun with camp etc but that won’t last forever
---
its a visual bug, you can leave the map border, but you cant place your camp
---
Not to kill the fun thread, but have to agree that the Dev’s have better things to do, like fix all the broken quests keeping my new character from progressing thru the main story line.
---
Honestly, just get it.  Get max rank class freak and it's -12 hp.  Essentially nothing at all.
---
take 2
---
It's fine. What isnt fine is missing an acct wide storage. It wouldn't be so bad if we could move things between alts In a shared stash box.
---
The displays for PA &amp; armor/outfits, the greenhouse, and BOS bunker all have my interest. The PA skins look neat as well. I generally liked S1's rewards, but these speak to me a little better. That said with these editions I might not end up really using the CAMP stuff until the Shelters finally release.
---
I wanna make sure I’m understanding this right. As of now the pts is testing an update where Bethesda not only nerfed the damage bloodied/ junkie builds  can dish out but every other type of build now has its damage output reduced?  So all this does is make every build weaker and still not level the playing field in terms of bloodied/ junkie vs other builds. Basically fixing nothing but making everything harder to kill. Forcing more people into bloodied/junkies to be able to keep up.
---
Save as much as much time as you can
---
What does she get you for being at your camp?
---
That is what you get for whining and asking for bloodied nerfs for months and months. The new damage calculations hurt the bloodied the most since it uses number of multipliers. Good job everyone!
---
i ive spent most of the day actual testing, its a shit show. there is no point to using anything less than the best now, and bad builds are just slightly worse.
---
hard to judge enemies, they are higher level, but rubberbanding is even worse now. they are very spongy compared to where they were. its not harder in any respect, just more annoying and less fun.
---
I’m just suggesting a change that would make the game’s camp building make more sense and enjoyable.
---
If it means hours of dev time then be it, take some of the atom shop and fo 1st money and dedicate some hours to change it.
---
Its not going to happen and I dont need to read the technicalities, its just another thing that makes total sense and bgs wont give us.
---
If we could play texas hold'em at tables in our own camps, I'd make the rootinest tootinest saloon camp in all of Applelatcheyaw
---
I found her today and got it for some people
---
Damn that jet pack looks disgusting.
---
Lol what I’m trying to explain is that mechanically it doesn’t make sense even though it sounds better on paper. It would be a lot more than a few man hours and ultimately Bethesda and fans would be better off just increasing the radius over reforming it into a cube, in terms of time and money.
---
To be clear, it’s not just take a cube and drop it in. Sounds simple but it requires more work than that. It’s the same reason we can’t replace our camp’s on the same ground. It’s not that the objects changed, but the way they interact with the landscape is a totally different thing. Same way. A cube would have to be handcrafted at each point by a dev to make it work seamlessly with the current system. We’re talking months if not years of development time. Not laziness or being cheap. We’re talking a total overhaul of a very basic building block. There’s a reason no other games attempt this sort of restricted game mechanic or just pull a Minecraft and make everything based on a square grid. The second you start proposing dimensions that are more difficult than just (x distance from center) it becomes a snowball effect of other issues. It mechanically just doesn’t work.

---
Give this a read over. Yes, Bloodied is taking a big hit, but everything is going to be in a much more concentrated range in terms of Damage output. 
---
The real issue is going to be not over-tuning the enemies, as right now on the PTS, they are VERY Tanky.
---
Fixes are  myth from back in the old  days, probably before your time.
---
It is easier to nerf things across the board with a single mathematical formula than implementing changes for each legendary prefix right? Right?????
---
Hey looking to play with people too. I've got a character at 108 and another at 5. Would you like a bodyguard or be one. Also I like to think I'm pretty chill.
---
yup been saying this since bloodied became popular. all that extreme damage should come at an extreme cost. I figured they’d buff the disadvantages of being bloodied rather than nerf the advantages but hey, whatever gets the ball rolling
---
I wonder how this will work with One Wasteland?
---
Go fight some folks, use area chat, even disboard for groups. This is a social game, find your crowd. If you have thick skin and like cancer, raiders are a good choice
---
Wow

---
Third post from the top on the "Hot" section.
---
Anyone know if the water/food GUI is still there? Or they removed it completely?
---
Im not worried about bloodied, if you read what I posted I implied everything is being nerfed. They choose to do so instead of rebalancing the weaker weapons and effects thus making them even weaker
---
I don’t understand the majority of the perk jokes
---
Nice work ! Is it possible Romero could be Moreno, he was responsible for communications. LH= lost hills?
---
Oof, maybe I shouldn't have bought 20 levels worth of score with my 400 hours of accumulated atoms
---
It’s glitched AF. It’ll be fixed...
---
Eventually. It’s an everyone thing. Ignore it, not an issue.
---
Just got a TSE90 50Cal from the purveyor, woohoo
---
Maybe the assholes responsible for this asshole behavior (via not having shared loot off rip) are to blame
---
Read the link, dude. 
---
This IS a rebalance. Instead of cranking things up to Bloodied's level, so everyone would be one-shotting anything in the game, they're tuning things down so the experience isn't too different between someone without any Legendary Modifiers, and a super developed Bloodied build.
---
Instead of all the Low tier gear being cranked up to the High tier gear, the High tier gear is being cranked down to the Low tier gear.
---
Again, the only problem now is that enemies aren't being adjusted to these levels as well. Yet.
---
That explanation doesn’t make much sense though. Yah, the math sounds nice now that bloodied’s aren’t 200% stronger, but in order to have their perk at full power they need 5% health... 1/20th of a mutant’s hp. And they only have 1 defensive perk that isn’t available to any other build... so why is it bloodied’s dmg is only 70% stronger now when their health is 5%? Not to mention all the special points that are now only additive too, making melee builds useless and all other special stats pretty unimportant only weeks before we get legendary perk cards made to increase those special traits...
---
And that isn’t even just bloodied. All specialized builds are just shot. While they are stronger, it’s specifically because berserker has no defense, bloodied has no health, and junkie is taking random hits to stats plus a ton of upkeep to maintain effectiveness. 
---
I’m not saying nerds weren’t necessary but this was way off the mark. Specialized builds should just be better than generic ones. A TSE can be used by any gun well enough. A bloodied requires a very certain set of circumstances and perks to be effective and so on. I know it’s just the PTS but they should have seen how far off the mark this was.
---
I mean they just have to enter photo mode to pose too
---
and any 200+ firerate heavy gun too
---
Security!!!!!
---
70% more damage is still a LOT though, especially given how much smaller the range of damage will be now. Yes it's not the almost 200% difference it used to be, but that vast difference was very frequently complained about.
---
Considering the explanation for why "magic" weapons are, well, "magic" (i.e. the exploitation of an inadvertent side effect of essentially giving the server side too many concurrent, and unnecessarily complex, calculations to evaluate at scale), and the overall difficulty of properly evaluating multiplicative percentage based calculations, I wouldn't be surprised if the switch to additive calculations wasn't entirely pragmatic. There's a reason why pretty much every online multiplayer game predominantly uses them for their most frequently evaluated calculations. It's just plain easier for everything involved to do, the server, the client, the developers, the players, etc. From a pragmatic perspective, "cheaper" calculations equates to less intensive resource requirements server-side, which in turn can help mitigate things like the "magic" weapon bugs. As well as potentially enable "downsizing" of expensive server-side resources (the servers, the VMs, etc.)
---
Lmao what I’m trying to explain is It totally makes sense mechanically, Maybe not programming and maybe not man hours budget wise, but using rectangular shape building blocks inside a sphere is a waste of space no matter how many times you say otherwise.
---
Again, they are not going to change it, its just a wishful thinking approach, and it makes no sense spending any resources changing it, people will continue to play as is so they wont bother making it better.
---
But you can’t argue that using cubic and rectangular shapes inside a sphere is efficient  use of space. I will accept that it is a lazy, fast and cheap/cost effective way, but thats it
---
Cheers
---
Thanks for replying. I don’t play on the pts. So appreciate you letting me know whats been going on. 
---
As for the nerf 🤦🏼‍♂️ I swear Bethesda is just pulling ideas out of ideas out of their butt. Things need buffs. Not nerfs. I don’t even want to see bloodied nerfed. Just make it so other builds can compete at a similar level. Hopefully they will rework it before pushing the update out. Otherwise I predict this actually hurting the game more then it helps. Especially if enemies retain normal damage resistance while we do less damage.
---
All the players complaining that the other builds should just get buffed meanwhile my full health excavator power armour and anti armour vats crit fill rate gatling gun build can 2 shot most enemies in the game.
---
With a sneak attack I can go over 900 damage with no sneak perks, no instigating and no damage boosting mutations
---
Whoever implemented the F1 Brotherhood Bunker props to that guy keep that employee and also greenhouse walls finally! I also notice more of a military theme and more cosmetic/camp items this time around so im not gonna complain on some non themed military items because this one has more stuff to put in your camp now they just need to increase the camp budget.
---
When a majority of people in a population is using it, it's cause it's BROKEN! Bring its damage down in line with other builds so you have to hit things twice or three times like any other build will allow for diverse play and unique builds. You don't have to use that one build that one streamer is using anymore!
---
Magic damage still happens on the pts with the same accuracy it happens on live. It has nothing to do with too many server side calculations it has to do with the effects from furious being triggered on high fire rate weapons that have effects in the same list as furious.
---
Bringing other builds up to something broken is how you get power creep and begin losing any trace of PvE difficulty that's left.
---
Bethesda is the worst company I’m existence for fixing any issue in their MMO
---
I play ESO for 6 years and they just repeatedly ignore the community they are working from a a cave of ignorance
---
Expect it too get worse when they just new pile content over existing flaws bugs
---
You fail to realize that its not only a problem of balance between weapons, its mainly a gear\game content balance problem.
---
As the game was too easy, as the SBQ dropper in 20 scds and could be soloed in less than a minute, its perfectly understandable rhat the powercreep as a whole had to be fixed. Thats the same in any MMO, and its perfectly fine as People are getting better and better gear.
---
I’m gonna go out on a limb and say probably not. It seems that they’re referring to someone else but unless but I don’t know who. I’m gonna explore the game a bit more to see if I can find a character that fits that name. 
---
Also, LH almost appears to be a rank or title, so I’m really confused about that one!
---
Several people has pointed out the grassy area yes yes yes wait till she goes in that direction follow and make sure you can hit Karen hard in the head you now have her attention and will land for you.  I have taken her away from 10 to 15 other players doing just that.  And no you can't cripple her right now but you can stop her from landing also she hates fire grenades watch when people throw grenades and shit at her she will take back off fast as hell
---
I’m just not gonna be bloodied if I can still be 2 hit but I can’t 3 hit enemies. I can do 400 with the right heavy gun. It’s balanced for a high end. I can’t function if I’m down to 300, and the plasma caster is now... garbage with these buffs
---
It sucks because I really enjoy these games too
---
I see, I misread the explanation on why that works. Thanks for clearing that up for me. Though even with that, I can see how that too could cause some high "cost" on an async client-server transaction.
---
I've seen this a bunch of times! It seems to be where people's camps load in before they're set in the spot that they're supposed to. The same thing happens to nukes, they load at the Raider mill in the corner and toons load just north west of The Whitespring.
---
And no gatling plasma skin. And no gatling laser skin. And there are more weapons without skins.
---
Do you use Lock and Load? This definitely happens with that card, been bugged forever.
---
Seems that its not the case, as you allready have some legendary damage perks that are not multiplicative like 2 shot and explosive
---
Zenimax handles ESO, not Bethesda.
---
Which is fine. 200% is a lot I get it, but once again. All it takes is some simple math based on the numbers Bethesda is giving us. You need 1/20th of your health to do 5/3rds more dmg. That doesn’t add up. 
---
A mutant player could kill a bloodied 10 times over by that math before being taken down, and that isn’t a specialized build. Almost everyone is a mutant and it requires 0 optimization to run. If your prefix doesn’t require optimization to maintain then it logically shouldn’t be the better prefix. 
---
And even when people say that you get all these perks and legendary effects. It’s true, but those also deny us lots of other cards that are just as helpful just to ensure we can be at the same lvl as other players in stats where we’re weaker. I have to devote like 10-12 perk points just to keep my defense at 75% of someone who uses no defensive perk cards. There was already a good balance, it just needed to be refined more and buffs applied on a case by case basis. Not sweeping changes that effect each build in drastically different ways.
---
i didnt even see an option to use atoms to progress ill have to see how much thatd cost me thanks for the tip
---
I just tried my old way and looks like it was patched out. Ah well, who knows
---
I know Zeni is the studio but but Bethesda still publish both games
---
The next season rewards look amazing! HYPE!
---
I think about 30% damage taken from bloodied builds would make them pretty fine. But why why why should I play when I can’t have weight cards and I still am 2 shotable, and I’m only going from 2 shots per enemy to 5. I don’t know, this’ll just suck. Don’t really want to have to spend another 200+ hours grinding for gear to go non bloodied or anything else
---
Bgs solution: carpet bomb everything to make the late game even more grindy than ever thank you Todd :))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
---
i might try the new character thing and i figured it was just for fertilizer i just love chickens lol weird i know
---
im going to try to grind as much as i possibly can i really want it lol
---
gotcha thats really smart that way i dont have to buy too many atoms thanks!
---
Also besthesda softworks is a subsidiary company of zenimax I’m sure they have people crossing studios
---
Everyone complaining about these nerfs and there's me who's never had a bloodied, TSE, or other meta gun. I'll make do with my rifleman perk cards
---
We should bet on arena fights. 20 ghouls vs 1 deathclaw.
---
You're misinterpreting the Anti-Armor effect as actually adding to raw total damage. Anti Armor only gets you closer to your true raw damage potential, that is: 100 + 37.5 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 15 = 212.5% damage. 
---
You can never deal that full amount of damage to an enemy, because of their armor. Instead, Anti-Armor applies a 1.28 multiplier to whatever your damage is after its been mitigated by their armor. 
---
Look at it this way. If I had a gun that deals 100 raw damage, giving it the Anti-Armor legendary does not mean it suddenly deals 128 damage.
---
EDIT: There's an old CaptainNoob video that demonstrates this quite well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIWryyf5NZM&amp;t=106s at the 3:50 mark. 
---
In it, he's using an AA-25-250 .50 cal, back when the 250 reloading tertiary effect would remove the 1st legendary prefix effect after reloading. You can see prior to reloading, he's dealing 71 damage, post-mitigation to the Super Mutant. After reloading, and subsequently removing his Anti-Armor legendary effect, his damage drops to 55, or a drop from 1.28x damage to 1.0 damage.
---
Of course there are far more practical uses of development time, BUT, if they went "full Scottish" with a golf DLC that includes kilts, and those goofy Scottish golf hats, and bagpipes that sound horrendous until you complete a ridiculously long and tedious questline that rewards you with bagpipe skills, maybe a CAMP putting green? It'd be almost forgivable that I can't fast travel 3 out of 5 attempts without a relog...  
---
A Raider nemesis, Shooter McGavin...
---
there's a player cool down. 40 minutes I think. if you swap toons to drop the next lot your first toon should be ready again.
---
I’ve resorted to no mans sky in the mean time it’s not
---
Perfect but infucjing love it
---
I play bloodied because I like being casual and not blowing a ton of ammo, and a relaxed game. I don’t like sneak so I just go ham with non power armor bloodied heavy guns. I don’t want the game to be harder so I have to have all damage cards for casual play
---
I think I’ve seen juice head talk about it and maybe ox?
---
probably still a few pts patches out before we really have any actual idea what the shelters will be like.
---
Thank god they finally added a timer for the lucky wheel
---
Basically It's a Bethesda property, but the development team is completely separate from Bethesda's staff.
---
Publishing a game is nothing more than providing the money it needs, no development or design.
---
Mostly just wondering about whether there's any effect before 50% hp. I tend to heal up out of habit if I notice my health that low.
---
Can i have your stuff?
---
Part of the upcoming Killer Clowns From Outer Space season.
---
Fully charged. From Stealth. For a \*GAUSS\* weapon. For most other builds, that's a one-shot. You take off the stealth damage, make the enemies move around, and that's eight-ten shots while you are being shot to gibs by all his pals, and then you still have to kill the rest of the gang the same way. Please, tell me how reasonable it sounds to take ten minutes to clear the West-Tek Courtyard when a Junkies Commando can clear the entire place inside-and-out in less?
---
It's an online title where builds are supposed to have some balance. Being basically a cheerleader for the heavy gunners and commandos in a team because you wanted to be a gunslinger, a viable build in every other Fallout, is in no way reasonable.
---
There's a scavenger that hangs out by my camp but everytime I load into the game my turrets kill her for no reason lol. Maybe try that, just plonk a turret aimed at them.
---
This. It already sucked being a (discount) Stealth Commando with a slower weapon. Now I don't even feel like that on the PTS.
---
You on Xbox? If so I can toss you a bunch of Xmas presents. You’ll get a bunch of caps, booze, plans, and junk from opening them.
---
This is a pleasant surprise. I totally figured this was only going to be an atom shop item based on previous datamines. Glad there is going to be an regular obtainable variant.
---
I think its pretty spread out, even a small amount of health loss increases damage.
---
I run a shotgun build without any interest in a Bloodied build and there's no way I can kill a Scorchbeast unless it lands (but then I start chewing it up, although I need a ton of shots). No way I could do the SBQ alone, but then that's a public event.
---
There's a distortion between the public nature of the game and what's intended to be solo and I'm not sure it can ever be adequately fixed or balanced.
---
Oh I thought you had something silenced, actually being able to kill them in 3-4 shots. I wouldn’t know what it like to use stealth with a gauss pistol since I don’t have one. But tbf, it’s a pistol which is less than subpar, especially since it’s a gauss pistol. However I understand your frustration since you’d expect gays to be extremely powerful.
---
Is bloodied getting nerfed?
---
I can help u with that. Feel free to add : ayes23
---
Good to know I can take a break next season and not feel bad. 👍
---
I legitimately have 6 mutfruit on a single farm tile. I didn’t use any tricks or glitches, just kinda rotated them to fit. I could only get 2 gourds  on a tile though.
---
Damage overall is. From what I’ve seen effects are going from multiplicative so additive. Taking damage numbers from 250 to 150 from what I’ve seen. I think melee has been hit the hardest
---
Let me explain it better. 
---
Bloodied is strong because is synergies with different perk cards and mutations. I’m fine if they lowered the damage a bit. However bloodied is still doing the most damage output pre nerf and everything got weaker. This gives more players the incentive to play bloodied. 
---
I was trying to say instead of giving everything a flat nerf why not give different builds something to help them out to an extent. This will make them more appealing and viable
---
Edit: Wording
---
Bloodied didn’t get nerfed everything got nerfed all damage
---
Can I get some? Lol
---
Um.... any build should be way better than one without legendary modifiers. That’s the entire reason we kill the same SBQ 3 times a day. Even more so if you spent half the game just optimizing your build so it only works with an extremely specific set of buffs and cards. That’s not just for bloodieds. The reason the old system worked, minus some needed refining, was because the top builds were all optimized so half their perks cards were built around that build. There’s no point going for an optimized build if you can keep your cards and perks the same between 10 different weapons and still see comparable stats. 
---
Everyone’s just going to go for the same generic gear now...
---
Bloodied got hit the hardest, and I mean, if it’s a rebalance bring up the bad effects.
---
With this and a pickaxe you could do  some good My Bloody Valentine cosplay.
---
I wanted to try it out since it was released but never got around to it. I think that’s what I’m going to play next haha
---
Papa romero is millitary code. They use a phonetic alphabet to encode words. Papa romero is a millitary call sign for paladin Rahmani. 
---
Shes the leader who is coming  from lost hills to Appalachia. I know that much but haven’t really checked out any of the other stuff. 
---
I think This is an encoded message where lost hills has lost contact with paladin Rahmani and fears the worst. It is also telling any survivors to divert from the original mission and reestablish communication.
---
Also first exi Edition Ark Force could be first Expeditionary Force. Expeditionary  Forces are a term used to describe military force dispatched to fight in a foreign country. Or in this case sending a bunch of bos from lost hills to Appalachia. A foreign place. 
---
The bos at this time is made up mostly of former military so it fits pretty well
---
Edit: for anyone unfamiliar or just wondering about the military call signs. Some country's have their own but this is probably one of the most widely used.  
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet
---
All of them are. Not just bloodied.
---
Off-topic and very dumb question? What weapon is that in game? I can’t figure it out. I love the m16 look so would love to have it
---
Raiders to me, foundation was boring tbh. Raiders aren’t fully primal evil, but it’s a prequel very far back from 3 and up, so seeing their decline into madness is more interesting.
---
Bloodied got neutered though, and nocturnal, assassins, etc are still bad
---
Handmade Rifle skin. Pretty sure it isn’t available now.
---
One-shotting almost every mob in game is soooo fun.
---
Same happened to my dailies. Timer reset but no new dailies available. Ffs bethesda fix this buggy mess
---
I do, but stealth isn't perfect, and even if it can be kept to 3-4 shots it used to be 1-2. On top of that, Gauss weapons have to be charged for a full second every shot while keeping your aim true, it shakes subtly at that point, so it's less accurate, and as such it's far slow than it sounds. We aren't talking 4 shots out of an auto weapon or even a 44.
---
Thanks for the very quick reply. I’ll look out for it in the atomic shop
---
All got nerfed yes, but bloodied gets it worse as it uses multiple damage multipliers.
---
The Halloween season looking to be lit between this and  the mannequins that totally aren't going to be moving around like in Skyrim
---
I was wondering that as well. Someone tried to spread a rumor about a fake inventory steal glitch about a month ago...
---
Good, honestly. Some of these builds were getting downright rediculous in their damage.
---
Don’t get me wrong it’s not NOt perfect but is amazingly detailed and immersive can’t wait to see the future of this game moving forward I give up on Bethesda they have two amazing titles ESO and FO4 prolly my favourite two games and they just greedy fucks who don’t give two shits about the company i al avoiding anything good to do with zenimax now
---
And need to stay that way. There needs to be bad prefixes and good prefixes, not everything can or should be equal. EDIT: And bloodied did not get "neutered", it is still the best prefix / build type.
---
Ultracite and T-65 do not have Headlamp mods.
---
It’s like when a kid bugs for something till you give it to them then suddenly they don’t want it anymore
---
I’ve wanted gameplays and it looks really fun. It would be cool if it was for the VR to make it feel even more immersive. 
---
I see why you’re saying with Bethesda and Zenimax, they’ve made very questionable choices in their games
---
Because you can buy GTA cash. You can’t buy caps.
---
You can 1-5 shot most enemys just with stealth and proper limb targeting. Not a big deal just gonna take more ammo imo bloodied will still reign supreme
---
Ok so now when I look back on this post I see that it's quantum spamming that is broken, not legacies, all quantum spammers have legacies but damage by legacies can be reduced but quantum spamming cant
---
I figured that Papa Romero must’ve been for a paladin but I couldn’t think of anyone besides Taggerdy in 76, my knowledge off the first couple of games is pretty much non-existent unfortunately (I will fix that in the future). What you’ve said makes a lot of sense!
---
thanks for the reply!   oh well.  guess im just using the vanilla light then.
---
It very much did. Bloodied is no longer the king, and why add bad effects, it just removes diversity of builds. There shouldn’t be good effects and bad effects, just different ones.
---
This defeats the purpose of legendary weapons, when it’s only 4-5 effects out of all of them that are even usable. This is a horrible change for the game, because they won’t bring things up any, just leaving them down.
---
This is fucking dope dude! Love the use of the weapon racks on the shelves!
---
*"and look forward to breaking out the good old AA weapons"*
---
Why? AA is still in the same place as it used to be when compared to other prefixes.
---
Haply cake day!
---
And your exactly right
---
Ooooh I loved this in New Vegas!
---
Not with heavy guns and without power armor. Sneak isnt an option, and the guns that need bloodied, like the plasma caster will suck because even now it’s good, after perfecting my damage on it. And it’s got one of the most expensive ammos in the game
---
Ssssshhhhhhhh, dude, keep it a secret
---
What if I like that tho?
---
Thank you for this, was wondering about it
---
Works for me.
---
&gt;Bloodied is no longer the king
---
Omg :DDDDD of course it is :D Still by a quite a big margin
---
Thank you. It is my misunderstanding.
---
can you even farm the RBV anymore? I get the same items when i try ever since wastelanders came out.
---
I have voice volume turned off in-game but it's still annoying cause I had to hear the damn Slocum Joe vendor jingle every two seconds while at my camp. I ended up scrapping it.
---
Yeah i roll a hybrid stealth commando/heavy pa build 2-2-2 on damage for each weap to have the points. Honestly w emergency protocols,
---
dodgy, action person, and corn soup rofl
---
Literal waste of time just like this comment
---
Yeah it changed I should delete the post
---
When I had a camp on that farm land in front of Charleston station all three companion stopped by in the space of a week, I’m a new player I had no idea they were hard to find.
---
I’ve beat both the questlines for Beckett and sofia so was gonna do the raider next (but no quest lines for those three right?)
---
Ad Vicotriam, Brother.
---
Why leave it then? 😉
---
^ This.
---
Because all the people crying out that "The Game should be harder" didn't actually want that it seems.
---
If someone takes the time to make a bloodied build, they deserve the damage, but if all damage is reduced with already bullet sponge enemies, where does that leave the game? Weakening bloodied by this much is way too much while neglecting other perks. 
---
Bloodied is high risk high reward, if they wanted to nerf it nerf serendipity or radicool. But now junkies will feel it, all others feel it and this is the worst way to balance the game
---
When?
---
Is it time for Berserker master race? (no but I'll keep dreaming with my god rolls)
---
My inventory is based on what the game has been giving me, I sell well below market to move product, and those 15-25 cap plans move fast
---
Yes and no. If overall damage is down but eneemy DR has remained the same or increased kn some cases (lvl100 muties vs 68) and AA DR reduction has remained the same, than AA is more effective than it was when being compared to thenother effects, bloodied/junkies in particular.
---
I am happy with the changes and I find funny that people cry about the "bullet-sponge" enemies that dies from 2 bullets...
---
Who wants to always have combat perks on in a game about scavenging and collecting. I need weight reduction and bloodied is how I can recover from missing out, by being a weaker bloodied. I feel like where I sit with my bloodied is perfect (400 on BE Gatling gun) and on other guns like plasma caster I can have (250/250) and it gets better with adrenaline to make the plasma caster feel fun, without it it just sucks
---
Ber probably feels it less since it's unlikely to be stacking multiple sources -- no adrenal reaction, for instance. Although maybe some people play low health berserker!? &lt;shrug&gt;
---
Is Junkies an extra nerf because each addiction is multiplicative?
---
When my regular crew and I have a first, we all use photo mode to get group poses.
---
PTS. It’s not live in the actual game servers, but can be played on PC. Part of the next patch
---
Because nerfing damage isn't the way to make a game more challenging,  there are so many ways to making fighting enemies challenging and giving more variety to builds but what they did was lazy .
---
Well time to start building full sets of armour to display
---
There was already a post about this by smarter men than me, doing multiple calculations and this AA thing you describe was debunked. I tried to find the post for you but apparently it got deleted for some reason.
---
I use the camp fire for crops.
---
2 bullets of a perfect bloodied build. If I didn’t have my bloodied I’d be at around 5-6. A huge difference
---
I still have qol perks like bandolier and batt included and swap heavy guns perks into more weight reduction when i stealth farm. I  just constantly changing my perks
---
I like change. But it feels like we’re just going backwards
---
"Already bullet sponge enemies". What? You can oneshot most enemies, post-nerf you will kill them with maximum 3 bullets. Where is the "sponge" part?
---
hilarious!
---
I just want to enjoy the plasma caster as it’s ammo is so expensive and I took forever to get a B33. But just now it’s good but not op, so if it gets taken down, it won’t be worth the crazy pricey ammo
---
I dont think it will show much of a difference on normal enemies considering they usualy die 2-3 hits with AA depending. 
---
But it WILL be super noticble on the SBQ and Earl due to their builtnin % damage reduction and high DR
---
Lol!!! 6 bloodied builds did not like your public service announcement! Don’t worry dude I got you down one🤣🤣!!
---
I jump in PA for groups as they always ruin stealth anyway and its nice to just lay wood in pa w a heavy when ur normally a squish.
---
Gotcha thanx. Just took out the Queen in 42 seconds so I was like that can’t be in affect yet. 😃
---
Super mutant warlords with non legendary weapons, ever tried it?
---
Ruberbanding has been around longer
---
My Q33 DB will finally get the love it deserves
---
My console can’t handle even opening the perk menu anymore so I try to minimize it
---
Last  PA skin that did it was the Settler PA iirc.
---
They'll certainly fix it.
---
Bloodied is a legendary weapon...
---
I’ve screwed mysefl and without my backpack and armor I’m 600lbs over
---
No, absolutely not. You know good and well they’re gonna take this post as a green light to do it, and they’ll find a way to charge you real money.
---
Becuase they arnt "godly" anymore.. take away that feeling of superiority in the virtual world and theyd have nothing else otherwise. Can you imagine if Bethesda added in girlfriends? Theyd never leave thier parents basements... lol... if your mad enough to downvote, then you know exactly why.
---
yah i lose carry weight even in excavator
---
Yup.. you ever tried using a non legendary weapon against them. They are tanky unless your build is tuned
---
That should be changed, but like general casual bloodied shouldn’t
---
ps4? i got room hehe
---
because it's not harder, its a ammo sponge now. i don't want to lose 3hrs for one good fight it's crazy. harder it's not more expensive !
---
edit : and if you dont know the difference between legacy / hacked and magic, don't come in these threads, you spread misinformation every time.
---
People would not mind to see harder enemies with bigger health pools... People hate to see lowered damage numbers on thier build. That's it.
---
I’m surprised people are actually arguing over this and calling people names... all I can say is lol. It’s still in the pts, and mod support will be out sooner or later 👍🏻
---
Be able to bet on nuclear winter matches and I’m sold. That would be sick. See the stats of the match players and make a bet, then sit back and wait.
---
Nerfing bloodied is easier then reworking every other legendary effect.
---
I just don’t use it anymore. I don’t know why I’m gettin downvoted so much. I’m mad that if bethesda makes bloodied less viable I won’t be able to try something new and exciting... but people just love downvoting me (garuntee they are mostly bloodied stealth commando)
---
No problem. Feel free to ask any questions you got about the lore. Also i recommend checking out shoddycast or oxhorn on youtube they both do decent fallout lore videos and have covered the brotherhood extensively. 
---
As for 76. Rahmani isn’t in the game yet. Iv seen her brought up on reddit a few times. She is from lost hills. Its where the brotherhood ended up settling down after roger maxson formed the brotherhood of steel. At this point most the brotherhood is over in lost hills. With maxson reaching out to create chapters across the states. I think lost hills is sending a party to find out what happened to taggerdy. 
---
 Come to think of it they probably have no idea taggerdys whole unit fell as I believe they lost communication with lost hills shortly before operation touchdown.
---
Does that means it’s better for the game?
---
I don’t even know what’s so heavy
---
I would love a players trade section.
---
a 'Maroo;s bazaar' for Fallout 76 would be perfect.
---
even just an item trade ability added instead of caps only.
---
You cry about the "huge" nerf to bloodied, then you start to talk about non legendary weapons...
---
So, show me a standard enemy that is a bullet-sponge with bloodied build. You mentioned it, so, please, show just one.
---
They know every1 is using bloodied. The stream had every1 using bloodied. Popularity will always get nerfed e.g. new OP champions in LoL or overplayed SSBU characters
---
But I didn’t expect them to nerf everything
---
haters gotta hate bud 🍺
---
The Enclave approves of this.
---
😂
---
Pretty much. Wish I could see how far down my post has gone
---
Of course not, just proof that theyre kinda phoneing it in. It would be a better player experience to actually have a balance, but that takes work and work cost time and money... -edit: Granted they are kinda working from home, but bugs go unchecked and simple things are still broken.. so i dunno anymore
---
I wish we could just kill this fucker and any other NPC like Ward... &gt;\_&lt;
---
I'm really curious about this too. Do turrets all stay low level? I hope someone can answer. If they don't scale up somehow... Well, I don't think it's going to be a good time for my sloth.
---
his names apparantly the subjugator
---
What a strange way to nerf bloodied builds. Bethesda should have just made it so, unyielding and adrenal reaction did not stack with its damage.
---
Is someone really on LVL 705
---
very late, i think around 80ish
---
I've been told it only works for guns with proper scopes, not just iron/reflex sights.
---
Naw. i'm fine with this
---
Sheepsquach, anglers, fog crawlers, mirelurk queens. If get out of stealth they are actaully a pain in the ass
---
Even worse, I couldn't see what he has for sale..
---
Exactly... if they made bloodied kinda eh, but made other build viable that didn’t exist before... I’d be all for it.
---
This is just lazy and people are mad at me for saying it
---
Sorry but I THINK (kinda forget) they were solved about a month or 2 ago but great work.
---
Yes nerf bloodied builds by nerfing everything. Great strategy
---
You are added
---
You be around tomorrow? I’ll gladly drop you some of these heavy motherfuckers 🤣
---
Indeed my friend indeed, hopefully when the new consoles drop theres also a push in quality control for game experience given theres gunna be alot more options for console players to switch to other games.
---
Forget the clown... How did you get the camp budget bar in you UI?
---
Sheepsquatches are no standard enemy, it is a boss-like, its a mini-boss. They have to be harder than a ghoul.
---
Anglers dies in 2-3 shots, hardly sponge...
---
Mirelurk queens are mini-bosses too. Again, they have to be harder than the normal mirelurks.
---
Wait, you call an enemy, that dies from 3 bullets "sponge"?
---
I want everyone to make a post like mine, get mad, make them hear it. I know I’m probably addicted to the game so I won’t just stop playing, I just want to still have a good experience
---
They didn't just nerf bloodied. They nerfed **all** prefixes by changing how damage is calculated (from multiplicative to additive). Bloodied just gets hit worst as is uses several different multipliers. But it is still the best prefix/build.
---
All melee builds are getting hit hard. I don’t use stealth so I’m scared to see my damage if this goes through
---
Three bullets for you? I have around 5-6 on spam enemies. I’m not playing fallout for a challenge experience I’m playing it to relax. What part of that is hard to understand, I don’t want to have to just point and click at things and wait
---
Tbh I’d be disappointed in the community if this hadn’t have been solved sooner. I figured that it must’ve been but I hadn’t heard anything. I do know that a clear version of the Brotherhood broadcast has been found though
---
If you are commando, ffr plasmas are very strong, if you are rifleman flamer is very very strong.  Prime it for more dmg and ammo efficiency.
---
It will be available as a &gt;!Treasure Hunter Pail reward, who have also gotten a revamp.!&lt;
---
I’d say if it’s under 2-3k and it’s good, get it. You can use it past lvl 50 anyways
---
lol
---
If you want we can play i am currently lvl 70. Killerskull2822
---
So shooting 5 bullets is an extremly hard challenge and takes way to much time for you. Allright.
---
One lesson every wastelander should walk away with, open-source 🍺
---
How about TSE vs Junkies?
---
Thank you for that! I will check those two channels out. 
---
I don’t see any reason as to why the Brotherhood would know about Taggerdy’s unit falling, most of it happened very quickly. I’m stoked for this DLC if I’ll be completely honest. I’m just recalling enjoying being able to watch this whole storyline unfold and turn into the world that we all know from the previous games
---
In my 620 levels of playing I've never experienced rubber banding because its due to lag and I'm only using a 2.4ghz net card.
---
Yay this thread again!
---
Oh gosh it's more complicated than I had thought! I appreciate the heads up about this
---
All I can say is I notice a huge difference in recoil with a handmade and longshot
---
All have thier issues, but Bethesda is in a class all of thier own. We used to think they were the worst, ya know, before that abomination Anthem took the crown, but these clowns are still renowned for their shit coding. You should look up some YouTube videos on it. Really fascinating.
---
Okay? Obviously not everyone runs that
---
Nerfs are not the way brothers
---
Because of exploits - ppl would scrip unlimited legendaries - unlimited rolls for "godroll" weapon. :( I think they should just increase the limit... At least 300 a day. Or 2500 a week. :D
---
give you a reason to play once
---
I am level 602 and was the same... BUT about 3 weeks ago it started. Once a time it goes WILD, I cant do anything basically, because it wont let me. :D
---
Suppose, just sick of the limits it's like they only wanting us to at for hour a day.
---
yeah, after yet another 3 weeks of season grind since all that glasshouse stuff is at the end of the seasonal run...
---
I'd Love to have a DLC with the blue ridge caravan and have our own caravan!
---
With all the amazing things apparently coming in season two they could replace those health kits with piles of dog shit and I wouldn't care.
---
2.4ghz is cheap $12 network card
---
New Vegas doesn’t have a lot going for it, what with being a single strip of civilization in a massive desert of nuclear aftermath.
---
Let’s not take the only thing that keeps the place worth going, outside of the delectable food over at the Ultra Luxe. They have the juiciest, leanest cuts of steak in the wastes. Grahm could learn a thing or two from the chefs there.
---
As long as they don't fuck with unyielding armour, bloodied is still gonna be great.
---
You cant stop the tide, the Brotherhood will roll over Appalachia like a storm of fire and leave nothing but thousands of faschnaught masks that no one wants and the insultbot becuase hes kool.... youve been warned of the future.
---
There's filler and then there's something that's literally useless. Caps and scrip and a bit of crafting materials are filler. 5 radaway and 5 radx is useful only to a character that walked straight out of the vault and hasn't done any quests, and even then they can actually play the game and get that many within the first few intro quests and a bit of exploration.
---
"Fixing" it could imply, at least for shotguns, adjusting their normal stats.
---
I liked the 400lb limit because it actually made you prioritize.
---
Paying for storage is a hilarious example of scrubs that can't cope forking over real money for something the game makes them do, but they don't wanna. Matter of fact anyone that can't cope with 400 alone is a scrub. But that's most of you so whatevs.
---
Not everyone plays on pc dude
---
Fun Fact.. if people are complaining that something is lacking, and that that thing has been added.... chances are... it ain't the same people complaining both times.
---
It's a magnificent increasy. Btw, doesn't fireproof only work against explosions?
---
Also maybe a feature to fiannly fix the god damn outer wall, if rather donate my concrete to that as they have been working non-stop and apologise for the inconvenience
---
we just ignore the colosus and farm screw and xp off minions.
---
Currently it is not worth the effort or ammo.
---
That is prob why folk were not responding
---
I love that mole miner. She gave me a bloodied fixer last week!
---
Great use, comrade.
---
While i wish they would have gone with something else because the brotherhood is in every single fallout game. I am excited just to see what happens. The brotherhood is all about the preservation and safe guarding of dangerous technology.  I highly doubt they are going to be cool about us dropping nukes or about the giant vats of FEV in west tek. 
---
Even though this is years before the events of fallout 2 and the reveal of the enclave on the west coast. kinda hoping they stumble onto the whitesprings bunker just so we can get the enclave brotherhood war started in Appalachia.
---
Good job, but you're late to the party. Also you might want to check [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gyd9db/all_transmissions_decoded_an_update_on_patch_20s/).
---
Great news! I remember your thread a few days ago where someone argued it should not apply to handguns because there are no real life anti armor handguns... heh
---
Thanks, looks our opinions aren’t popular
---
Definitely need instanced camp with all that.
---
Tbh bloodied seemed like the only meta you was forced to do to actually be strong and I'd rather it be nerfed so that it gives a chance for more builds to stand a chance
---
"Take 45% less damage from explosions *and flame attacks.*"
---
Although given the nature of this game, it's entirely possible that it's broken.
---
It’s not even locked behind the atom shop... those bastards
---
Ugh. I'm dreading this update. My Dad plays, and bless his soul.. he's terrible. He's gotten better, but he's just not got the reaction times.   But that's ok, cause he sticks to the low level areas and stays in his power armor when I'm not around to help him out. I'm very much afraid this is going to make the game unplayable for him unless I'm there to protect him. &gt;.&gt;
---
Nerfs are fine if they fix the rewards that were nerfed becuase all our asses were OP. Restore the serum plans as drops. Give us 3 star legendaries as drops from the harder events.
---
Make the reward equivalent to the risk. Don't just nerf an already demoralizing grind.
---
I’m sure they would like to, but that would be illegal in a lot of places and could lead to the game being banned in those places. So it’s unlikely.
---
They should have focused on content and fixing the bugs first then worked on damage and weapons AFTER the fact who cares how you balance a weapon when we are all tired of killing the same things over and over with it
---
Did you even read the post, about brining other weapons up so that we can have variety? Or are you trying to flex on me how amazing you are that the game
---
10/10 would buy something even if I didn't need it.
---
Hey, had a look at the axe, it's a lvl 50 with vampire, +50% limb damage and +1 agility. Let me know if you want it, otherwise I'm putting it back in my vendor. You can have it for free. My PSN is Aramor.
---
Love that game, it’s sooooo relaxing
---
I usually give them the pimped deep pocketed light leather armor, pimped vault suit, maxed shotgun, maxed suppressed 10mm and suppressed hunting rifle, with a few stims and random drugs to boot.
---
Yeah but this game has insane RNG (and bugs) on drops to the point where certain things are basically impossible to find, and inventory space is too limited and annoying to manage between characters to really hold onto things in case 'metas' change.
---
Yeah I was low on stims but I gave them some food and drink instead
---
Lol yep! Thought about that exact post and laughed to myself
---
Or, Beth invests in cheap sock puppets. 
---
Who really knows?
---
https://www.nortonlifelock.com/blogs/research-group/identifying-sockpuppet-accounts-social-media
---
Even if they want to nerf it (all), Bloody 'should' still be the strongest considering having to sacrifice most of your HP to use it, otherwise it'd be a stat as meaningless as Stalker melees (which still wont be fixed I'm sure).
---
Great detail!  Really well done!
---
holy shit these people are actually crying that their instakill weapons still instakill just not as hard anymore.
---
I watched this guys live stream on YouTube i believe his name was captainnoob. He was soo incredibly disappointed and upset by "how much they ruined the game with their nerfs" while simultaneously two tapping a level 100 super mutant. Then called them bullet sponges straight after. Are you serious? What the fuck are you all upset about you still insta kill everything in sight
---
Just because the hit indicator number isn't as high as it used to be doesnt mean you arnt destroying everything with a single click of the freaking mouse.
---
This is just ridiculous. And I completely understand why bethesda is doing it. especially since they just announced the one wasteland update which makes enemies scale to surrounding players level instead of fixed per spawn location. Be a pretty pointless update if most players can just insta kill anything in their path with their overkill bloodied explosive 3657 Damage output gattling lasers.
---
Dunno about rifles, but as a junkie's heavy weapons guy I can still kill supermutants and standard scorchbeasts instantly at optimal range.
---
You could play the game and earn the plans? They kinda toss em at ya from quest and events.
---
I’m alright boss I think my sledge suits my build more
---
Thank you! That was awesome to read through
---
What is going on? i leave it for 2 days and now people are talking about death threats? IDK
---
Regular PS4 but from what I've read, it affects PS4 Pro as well
---
How can I be as lucky as you
---
I hate the brotherhood update
---
It’s different people. Some wanted the game to be harder. They don’t complain now. Others didn’t - some of these complain now.
---
What? No... next we'll get loot boxes for atoms.
---
They have something called "piercing gaze" now that makes them more perceptive. If that means it they can see me in CSA I am not doing ops it seems :/
---
To be fair, it was a while back that they said they were going to balance the weapons in the One Wasteland update. They just neglected to say what form that balance would take.
---
Is Resilent mutation enemies reqires last hit with melee or deal entire damage with melee?
---
Are these like... lvl 200 super mutants?
---
Lol. And I usually message them with something along the lines of I may have helped you but I will not hesitate to kill you over a workshop
---
Nah I checked many times and it is a lvl 45. I’ve been disappointed a lot by the level cap lol
---
No idea if it is related to your problem, but for a while one of my characters was 'hard locked' (server not responding) whenever he tried to access a workbench. After extensive use of google I deleted all .ini files in the install directory and in documents/my games/fo76 and let the game recreate them at next start - fixed it for me. Maybe worth a try.
---
I don't really need to explain anything, Bethesda should just go look at how Warframe designed "Nightwave" to see how to do a non cancerous "battle pass."
---
Do you have a magic gun tho?
---
So, the truth is, the game is WAY too easy even with a nocturnal weapon. And all and every weapon will get adjusted (you call it nerfed, lol), so the damage buffs are not multiplicative, but additive. So, it is not X×1.6×1.8×1.5×1.2×1.15, but X+.6+.8+.5+.2+.15. As you can see, bloodied has way too many synergy, way too many buffs and makes the already way too easy game even more easier.
---
For quaility enjoyment, it has to be a bit harder, and changeing the damage formula from × to + is the very first step for this.
---
Some of the people in the comments really said:❌🧠
---
I want to know too. Im not sure what to turn too if bloodied just doesn’t work for me anymore
---
Haha yes, I was thinking the same when I evaporated the level 9 with an explosive laser rifle lol, just cause I helped doesn't mean your in the clear
---
Well depending on if my account gets taken from me permanently, I don't think luck is the word I would use.
---
Oh jeez that’s good
---
What....? I never said anything about them sending death threats
---
That’s pretty good
---
I have some dog tags on me. Where is your camp located? ;)
---
Then we need other perks to be good in the first place, can’t say I never said that. Bloodied perks need nerfing, like serendipity not it’s damage
---
Benefactor, not savior right?
---
Guess it’s bad RNG
---
Nah ur good, they can most likely tell you didn’t do it. Might disappear tho
---
Yes, albeit horribly buggy I'm sure, but fun (probably)?
---
It works and its still the best but it seems everything is calculated differently so everthing is nerfed. I wonder if my fragile CSA rifleman can play anymore....
---
Think so
---
No I haven't. They sound terrifically terrifying.
---
Yeah the exact same issue and I have no doubts they will, but is this just a regular fallout 76 thing we accept now? Buy broken product in the hope of a fix later down the line? Last one I had was the secret service camo under armour that is bugged and I'm unable to mod it. Still waiting for a fix for that too. This type of bullshit just seems to be the norm for fallout 76 products it's a disgrace really
---
How?.. Ive made tons of friends since public teams was introduced, specificlly becuase of it. You gotta mic? I "talk" to people instead of just using emotes like everyone does. It makes one seem less like a random person, and more like someone your willing to team up with.
---
I... never considered that.
---
Bloodied rifle build, and I one-shot most things.  The number of times I've missed out on a legendary because it was dead by the time I switched weapons is greater than the number of times I've accidentally one-shotted one.  This fixes that.
---
Fallout 76 does not need a casino. Terrible idea.
---
Well right now if I’m tired I die pretty quick... and if it’s worse I don’t know what to switch my build too. I hate addictions, I hate power admire, not sure what to do. Want a new kind of build but they aren’t changing old perks
---
It was cracked and posted on Reddit more than a month ago :)
---
How do you know for sure? I assume they have some sort of bot that scans for stuff like this and seeing something so obviously modded in as a level 50 handmade would surely set it off right? I would assume these guns have a different ID than normal handmades.
---
So in the new patch what health level will have to be at to get max bloodied damaged &lt;5 %?
---
Logs in next day, armor is wandering around the camp. (ref to an old skyrim bug)
---
I was using my JE gatling gun on super mutants. Even my M79 took them out in one or a couple shots. I think I used my J25 LMG on the scorchbeasts, so maybe it's magic.
---
Yeah, you get banned for life. You better pack your socks because FBI and Bethesda hand in hand are going to get your ass.
---
Level 100.
---
Seems like you have to go in in PA, w/o having excessive weight, have perks for PA sprinting, come in quickly to your first location, then go to those sites and secure them, and then go out.
---
I have no idea how to win this thing w/o PA.
---
a special readjustment to max your intelligence , well rested, canned meat, berry mentats, PA headset intelligence boost equipped. Unyielding armour and run at a third health.
---
Stay in building teams.  (+4 intelligence)
---
All those on, knock off daily's and weekly's, SBQ, Rad rumble, Line in the sand, surface to air, Monster mash, P paradise every time it pops, Burrows and Whitesping runs and you will be climbing quickly.
---
I have traded alot of stuff for a long time (since beta) that I promise is suspect. Never personally sploited anything and still here.
---
AA is not changed in itself, but is made marginally more effective compared to before on higher damage builds, and is significantly more powerful compared to other damaging effects, even if it is still not the best. 
---
Some napkin math
---
So for a 100 damage weapon, against an enemy with armor N&lt; anti armor acts as a \~30% damage multiplier. N is an amount of armor that is enough to cut the damage by 50%&lt; after calculating out armor penetration (so Dx2).
---
With just your three 20% damage perks the damage works as follows (1 sig. fig.)
---
Before - After
---
172.8 - 160
---
With junkies (5 addictions, 50% damage)
---
259.2 - 210
---
with bloodied (80%)
---
311 - 240
---
Armor piercing (normalized theoretical damage)
---
224.6 - 208
---
The actual damage numbers for armor piercing are the same as just perks, but the effectiveness of armor is reduced by a factor that makes it like firing a higher damage weapon. So for 160 damage you get the same effective armor as firing a 320 damage weapon, so a 208 damage weapon with no ap would deal the same damage.
---
Enemies with less armor than twice your weapons damage will not be as effected by the armor piercing as significantly. 
---
The more damage bonuses you stack the bigger the effect of armor piercing, if you stack a total of 267% damage bonus the armor piercing theoretically matches bloodied at 80% increase, assuming you have a low damage weapon or extremely armored enemy.
---
It was really nerfed? I played several hours yesterday and noticed nothing different from other days or weeks. I do also use combat rifles, hunting rifles and knives
---
Have my upvote before others downvote lol. I agree with ya man
---
What are your damage numbers per shot?
---
Makes tons of sense, there are only so many fo4 assets to reuse (or resell to us).
---
What kinda damage can you do?
---
Also, try a vampires weapon. I like a vampires shotgun
---
Would have helped if you had stated that at the beginning
---
No, the damage output is insane, and there is no risk at all, even without serendipity. Only poison can kill you in bloodied build, but you will have a legendary perk card for that.
---
The damage nerf is fine, fair and long overdued.
---
I smell a fallout-verse GI*JOE/COBRA analog coming.
---
For sure, just tell me when your on, ill meet up with you
---
"Residents of Foundation, there is a nuke incoming! Get to cover!"  
---
Residents response, "Hmm I'm going to ask Sunny for some Water Ice."
---
Someone gave me a recon rifle and some heavy leather... Little did they know I was on my mule account 🤣 felt bad scrapping it but eh, shoulda known no actual new players are on this game
---
Yeah but it seems this will be a factor that changes. It requires people to adapt to different strategies instead of cloak in corner and shoot.
---
Place a flamethrower trap or pungee boards in the place she spawns.
---
I heard you need an adobe license to edit/mod the files, downvote away billys kiddos
---
It was 129 on a headshot last I remember. I don't think I had any damage boosts other than perks and maybe adrenaline.
---
Haha, I just like to help people, it does feel bad though when someone goes to some effort to make you some good stuff but they don't know I have v2525 10mm in my stash v25rw fixer, BE stuff but despite that I still do it as they could make some use, like maybe they will learn a new mod😂😂
---
Melee: instigating &gt; Bloodied
---
Anti armor still exists as well it's gonna be fine.
---
Because not everyone can log in every single day.  If I have to travel for a couple days, or have obligations outside the game, or just feel like taking a single day off of the game, I'll miss out on score I can't make up by playing a little longer another time in the week.
---
Exactly right - this second seasons has at most 2 decent rewards ( the BOS bunker being one of them ).
---
My instigating Gauss Rifle can make around 800-900 when I shoot intp the supermutant's head. And this is when my Expert Rifleman perk was 1, not 3 (didn't notice that). With ER3 its around 1.2K damage into the head.
---
The problem, however, is that there are simply way too many enemies. I literally can't shoot them fast enough cause they come and come.
---
Update:
---
It takes two-three full charged shoots to kill one mutant. Given that they freeze their targets, my movement is slower, and it takes way longer to shoot them then usually.
---
lol, everything has been heavily nerfed. You are not even dealing half the damage you used to do before.
---
Just did a SBQ on the pts. Was doing around 20 dmg with my BE handmade. Headshots. Used to be around 200 damage (without sneak criticals).
---
I’ll check it out
---
It's still restricted by zone, unfortunately. For instance, I think the Forest's max cap is level 25.
---
And there goes my char down the drain :P
---
How have they nerfed bloodied? You rant alot but don't explain what they have done? Is this on the pts server?
---
Implying that a single shit will be given about consistency?
---
Despite it being solved I genuinely enjoyed reading this and your excitement for it. You could have researched on Google what the message was but you allowed yourself to dive into the game and enjoy it from within. I love the energy from this post. Thanks for sharing!
---
Why would they go down the drain? I doubt its not a permanent ability for these events. Its like encounters in other video games where there is a cycle of buffs the enemies gets so you dont just use the same meta weapons everytime you do the encounter. I prefer this to just going in and just 1 shotting everything every single quest i do.
---
Great post - my thoughts exactly.

You just need to check this reddit or the pts forums, everyone is talking about this.

---
True enough. Being low level is hard especially trying to have enough ammo to tag enemies. I made a new account for level up challenges and without the ammo blueprint glitch doing events or quests would not have been possible. I forgot how frustrating this game is at low levels I'm surprised people make it to 50 🤣
---
They shouldn’t have nerfed the damage numbers can, they should’ve only increased enemy health and dr to our levels
---
I did 3 queens 15 hours ago and reached ~350 sneaking with a bloodied railway rifle and ~100 with a combat rifle. I didn't feel any different
---
This will be like the vault raids then. 5% will do them.
---
pts?
---
St. Peter don't you call me cos I can't go, I owe my soul to the company store.
---
Looks great!
---
The question is what's the best strategy here. So far it seems like PA is the only viable way to survive long enough.
---
I once emoted a thumb down to a such person. He started emptying his all ammo on my face without waiting millisecond. Some people are so full of rage, no place left for brains.
---
Hows the SCORE situation with the adjusted points?s
---
Bloodied zealots love to paint the narrative that they're fragile glass cannons when really they're more like ceramic cannons. 
---
There are so many synergistic ways to improve survivability that it's not that big of a penalty for the significant bonuses reaped.
---
Bloodied aren't that fragile. This is coming from a bloodied player too.
---
What’s this about freezing?
---
They freeze you when shooting. It's like cryolator effect.
---
We had this happen when someone launched less than a minute after the SBQ died.  Nothing spawned, everyone was mad.
---
Sounds like you think that only bloodied can one shot?
---
Is this a new thing or like a modifier for these dungeons?
---
We shouldn't resort on such things to bypass bad design.
---
I'm glad to see that Bethesda is addressing the issue of combat balance.
---
I don't know if this is the answer but at least it's a start. I look forward to a game where end game bosses are actual challenges and not an afterthought that can be taken down in fractions of seconds.
---
Without magic, shotguns aren't really viable at endgame sadly and yeah this'll just end in magic guns being more necessary for SBQ and colossal and having stuff die in 5 seconds, is worse than current bloodied, junkies and melee builds
---
So we are supposed to "skip" the events in low level zones because they wont give as much reward? Not great imo. :(
---
I am a power armor build and I have friends who play the game who can tank a lot more damage then i can with combat or metal armor. Of course I havent played the PTS so i dont know if this will have changed or not but it seems to me if sneaking is ineffective, perhaps a team of people, one tanking the damage in powerarmor if that is needed while others try to complete the objective, it doesnt appear that this event was meant to be done solo and if you can do it solo it will require a specific way to do it, like power armor. Since it takes place inside the valley galleria there is a top and bottom floor that can be used to a team’s advantage. This along with the many stores inside can allow for easy kiting of mutants if they are that hard to put down.
---
Yeah, I definitely agree with that person, it has to be realistic. Like my plasma flamer. 
---
What? Do you *not* have one? Poors.
---
It's the norminal word there.
---
Unlimited junk storage is the reason people pay for Fallout 1st.  They're not changing it.
---
I have legendary drop alts.  I also use them on days where I can't play for long enough to level.
---
Wait really? Well I guess I'm no longer going to move my camp. No point moving back to low level areas.
---
I would definitely go there but Bethesda would need to up the cap limit quite a bit 1st
---
I want to know this too.
---
I'd love if we could put our displayed items and vendor items in a different storage.
---
No idea. But no matter what they use, they freeze me. They are literally called "Freezer supermutants" or smth like that.
---
My stealth bloodied sniper can resist/avoid hits from a deathclaw 91, not saying the nerfs are needed or deserved  ( Who am i to even claim if a thing is balanced ? ) but the fact anything kills us is over exagerated.
---
Ah so it’s not like CSGO now... good. That would be bad. These could be interesting. If they are rewarding
---
Give us more Whitesprings content. Maybe an Event where the goal is to hit ghouls on the greens, dressed in golfing attire
---
Nah, even I can one shot with my non-min-max build if I wanted to, just usually not in full battle mode. But bloodied builds can run through the event like death himself. There's also unyielding meelee, though at least they have to run over. And of course there are godmode weapons, which I also have but don't use on legendaries.
---
Workshops do have a square build space though?
---
Wtf ? I thought the point with scaling was scaling ?
---
A question: how are shotguns doing? Was the bugged aspect fixed without boosting the dmg? Also, what about gauss vats bugs (first shot missing) and other gauss weapon bugs (getting locked and being unable to reload/sprint/use items)?
---
Calm down.
---
We don't know yet if it's a nerf or a bug....
---
(history of bethesda Fallout games let me think it's a bug)
---
The weapons are not the thing that is really nerfed, it's largely the ridiculous perk stacking.
---
how much damage should you do with your 3 20% damage perks, nerd rage, and bloody mess.
---
Previously you were dealing 238% more damage.
---
They now stack together in a linear way to get 195% total damage, a 43% damage loss, 18% reduction overall.
---
The fact bonuses no longer go completely bonkers means things can be balanced and changed more reliably.
---
Bloodied to the biggest hit because they had the most dumb multipliers. Add 50% adrenal and 80% bloodied bonus and you get 325% damage. Multiply them as previously and you get 644% almost double and completely out of whack with everything else in the game. Take away the perks and bloodied/adrenal by itself is only 270% damage, which isn't that much in the grand scheme of things, but add the other stuff and it gets out of hand fast. 
---
I haven't even calculated how the multiplier amps when factoring in strength, chems, food, alcohol, and all the other garbage.
---
Well we will be getting instanced camp rooms soon. I imagine that's why we can have real displays now.
---
No you will not only see those weapons. In fact I hope we will see more variety as I’d argue those are the only ones we currently see due to bloodied being way to OP especially as dying has no real penalty to balance the trade off.
---
How do you not know that there are console players though? 🤔
---
We want stuff to be buffed up to bloodied. It’s pretty unanimous. We don’t want nerfs of any kind.
---
The thing is aswell how can you break ESO and FO like how stupid do you have to be the games stand the test of time to this day I regularly play F03 and NV fucking amazing.
---
Microstransactions monthly subscriptions zenimax made this Model of mmos on
---
Consoles becuase they thought they could whore out the game franchises and they achieved it but at what cost as much as people want to argue at the end of the day they published it they want a return it’s an investment to draw people in and invest heavily on the game through gear grinding. Don’t get me wrong I love it the grind but the most they will refuse to fix major changes that need making.
---
Becuase they don’t have the time to fix content only make new content to put over broken one to bring more customers in the game this is my opinion
---
Well said. It seems grind has replaced difficulty in a lot of newer games. That's prob why Dark Souls was such a hit - good old-fashioned tough gameplay you have to 'git gud' at.
---
I assume so, iirc monongah is 50/50 ghouls/mole miners
---
Not a big problem for machineguns but for snipers and such with long reload time after each shot (like hunting rifles), their effective damage nerf will be too much?
---
So what builds should we get into now? Two-shots or anti-armor + explosive?
---
Intelligence will still work for getting extra xp right? So going full unyielded will still gives about 30% increased xp?
---
They can respawn but it requires a brand new player to enter and appears to be on some timer of sorts. Gone are the days when you could alt+f4, rejoin off your team and instantly respawn them
---
I agree 100%
---
So unplayable. Ok.
---
How about...
---
Leave the weapon damage alone.
---
The higher the level, the BETTER the weapons/damage they can deal out.  EG;
---
Scorched - Heavy guns and PA, pieces missing like helmet but still powered.
---
SM - Heavy guns, full metal armour.
---
Raiders - Heavy guns, sniper rifles, plasma grenades.
---
They all fire far often and dont just run at you dumb style like most do.
---
Time doesn't excuse an exploit. And trying to use time it has existed to validate it is a fallacy.
---
New plans?
---
telephones
---
I just picked up one yesterday with +250 dr while reloading and +50% limb damage. Average secondaries but stacked healing
---
Just because they did it one way the first time doesn’t mean it’s going to be the same this time. 
---
I’m sure that they will announce the all the rewards before it goes live.
---
Holy shit! Are you for real??!! Did you capture any of it?
---
&gt;. Players didn't exploit any unintentional game defects, Bethesda simply didn't thoroughly think through the ramifications of the various gear/perk/buff synergies that feed into a character build optimized around a particular weapon property which resulted in a set of synergies that can be utilized by players to produce an outsized/unbalanced build.
---
So what part of that isn't exploiting unintentional game defects?
---
Nihil Ad!
---
Rule 10
---
You. I literally quoted the definition of exploit and you try to change the definition.

My tip would be NOT to mess around with the client. Fo76 can not even handle the switch from 5.1 to headphones w/o staying muted and refusing to utter even a beep.
---
Yea I was in the same boat haha. I’m just past the chicken coop, but plan to do as much as I can from now on, so I feel pretty good about it.
---
Plus if we do end up getting another double score weekend, that’ll help immensely.
---
Whitespring, Bolton Greens and Hemlock Holes.
---
If rhey did it once a month it would give me a reason to.play more. I dont play too much these days because my stash is full of 3star legendary items I dont  want to drop and can't sell enough each day.
---
Damn. I figured there'd be a minimum level cap, not a max level cap. So much for opening up the whole map again
---
Ah, I see, I never did that when I played a year or more ago
---
I can kind of agree with melee getting to be useless, I personally use unarmed and I stack loads and loads of aid effects for damage, this allows me to be a glass cannon in a way where I do a lot more damage than gun users but am vulnerably as I need to get in close, now I don't really think the trade off will be as worth it. Guns will just be plain better, not to mention that the new best damage effects aren't available for melee weapons (assuming it is indeed TSE) But I am not saying this is how it'll play out as I haven't gotten onto the test server and I am also not saying melee will be so awful that I'll switch away from it.
---
No just thought it'd be cool 😅
---
&gt;Or buff other builds so you don’t alienate your player base by making the time they’ve devoted to playing valueless. 
---
Power creep. You only get power creep by buffing everything to ridiculous never intended levels.
---
It is clear that no game intends for players to be this strong. If you have ever played ANY video game besides 76 you should have realized this. You chose to exploit this poor game play. So no real sympathy for you.
---
tagging op u/LuisMacarandan
---
What about non meta builds. Did they also get a slight nerf damage wise?
---
NEVER thought I’d be back in Appalachia.
---
PC ganggg yo if u ever need help add me; SamwichPringles
---
It is less because the weapon perks like commando are probably also additive and not multiplicative. 
---
In your example the multiplier would be
---
1.95x1.5x1.6=4,68
---
Vs
---
1+0.95+0.5+0.6=3.05
---
So it's only 65% of the damage before... 
---
that's a lot less, and I think a lot of people have to rethink their build's. But I think it's not that bad as more builds will be viable =)
---
I wasn’t paying attention I though this was fallout76 marketplace
---
Really good explanation. I'm not playing the PTS since i moved the account to Steam but...
---
I read a few times now that the new max lv for enemies is now 100. I welcome this change tbh. BUT! Can we then have equipment that goes to higher levels as well? This would be the correct way imo AND would eliminate the dupers. Of course the legacy weapons would still be usable as the difference isn't that high. What do you think?
---
Most weapons don't have skins. You also can't have an explosive plasma rifle, even as a legacy. Plasma rifles were bugged and only dropped as 1* before they removed legacy energy weapons. Also plasma rifles can be quite good. Stick a flamer and pulse capacitor on it and see what happens
---
Is that a fallout new vegas owb reference
---
Like is was fixed in the patch notes,  went live and wasn’t fixed?
---
I think Todd said, “who knew in an apocalyptic survival wasteland people would be nice to each other?” Good for u, I enjoy helping as well 🍺
---
It works perfectly fine in RDR2 online with a currency not tied to peoples' wallets.
---
if melee took just as many hits as a rifleman or commando for example, what would be its use? That would be a lot more risk for no reward, I play unarmed, rifleman myself.
---
I can go in and expose myself for one-hits or stay a lot safer for two-three shots with a rifle (on large enemys, most mobs are still one-hit there), so I felt it was fine. 
---
The enjoyment is only sucked out when people instantly kill things you want loot from during events as an example, but any weapon can do that, there is no need to gang up on melee characters.
---
Pm me your gt and I’ll message you on Xbox
---
There is a creepy new clown statue that iv seen.
---
No, you are going to see even less weapons.
---
I'm not talking about other legendary prefixes. Nobody would ever use a shovel for example, because is a damn shovel, but thanks to bloodied they were still kinda viable and (most importantly) fun to use.
---
But now anything that isn't a handmade or a fixer is going to be crap and unusable. They just killed all the weapon variety and everyone will stuck only with a few weapons because all the rest don't have the damage. Doesn't matter if they are AA, B, J...
---
I think by submitting a Ticket you'd rather risk a ban...
---
Cool 😎 Can u please tell me where to find this banner in the build mode? I can’t find it anywhere 🤪
---
Fast firing heavy guns are made for this
---
Everything that deals obscene damage probably deserves to be knocked down a peg or two.  The only problem is I don't believe Bethesda will be thorough enough to knock down everything that deserves the same treatment.
---
But if they do manage to be more thorough in the future, maybe then the better balancing efforts can go through a lot easier once things have been more or less equalized.  Perhaps through a general nerf to enemies, or a buff to under-performing weapons.
---
This sucks. Not the update I wanted at all.
---
Honestly the reason i don't play with the people im in a team with about 90% of the time is because exp isn't shared unless you tag the enemy. I play as melee so I either get all the exp or none of it.
---
First Exi Edition Ark Force......Almost certainly "First Expeditionary Force" given the context.
---
Got yourself a deal - idiot ;)
---
Thank you for your kind words. I do enjoy the opportunity to solve the puzzles within the game, in fact for a while there, I knew nukacrypt existed but I was still trying to hunt down code pieces and manually solve the nuke codes as well.
---
Pal, you addressed a third party like someone else was part of this. At no point did I change the definition.  I stated that it was neither an exploit in violation of the ToS, nor was it unfair or mean. Again, not an exploit, in any sense of the word.
---
This^
---
Everything got nerfed damage wise
---
If they’ve fixed her being able to be crippled then she will still die in under a min.
---
The stash size limit causes some players to stop playing 76 (such as my former team members) because they have to spend too much time doing inventory management rather than playing.
---
Any claims that this is necessary for server stability are bs. It's an effort to keep people online longer.
---
Yeah, because the BOS has such an easy time stopping Super Mutants in the future, I'm sure they'll deal with Appalachia just fine!😂😂😂
---
&gt; I never cared about the meta.
---
Riiiiight.
---
&gt;I only played bloodied because with it you can pretty much use anything and still be able to clear any dungeon easily.
---
Loooool.
---
I agree. Sometimes it's so bad, I dump half a mag in a supermutant and it does not even tickle him. A few seconds later I kill him with 2 bullets...
---
They basicly ignore all my armor and cripple me within a second most times. Which sucks because im a melee character. Whereas my ranged character dosent even get seen by them.
---
if bloodied is too strong, then buff the other effects, dont kill peoples sense of progression
---
once we have felt what its like to have a powerful build, it is not fun to go back and struggle to clear wes tek etc
---
Bump it to 1,000, seems like a nicer number to me.  Ideally 1,200.
---
I never really hoarded too many things like heavy armor, weapons, or all my ammo, so 800 gets the job done with the prioritized junk gathering and sorting.  I don't plan on relying on the scrapbox crutch anytime soon
---
That being said, I wouldn't mind one last expansion or two just for the sake of being able to keep some reserves a little higher.
---
This💪 I just butt it with my weapon.
---
Perhaps the solution is to not put all your rad toad eggs all in one radioactive basket? 
---
Maybe have your melee build carry a couple stealth boys? Or that escape device you can make with one?
---
Yeah I experienced it the first time this week, after the Server crashed in the middle of a queen fight. On the next Server I had a cooldown on the same silo...
---
It happened to me in nw. Imagine my misery when I died because of it ☹
---
I am sorry that is the case, I am a bit newer to the subreddit and just wanted some opinions
---
So far legendary enemies, scorch beast, and even sheepsquatch have been instantly killed due to excessive high-power damage from players. The special enemy should be mighty. I agree to nerf the damage.
---
I got a Vamp Gat Plas here, and it is a lifesaver during queen events!
---
But knowing what they are like, you can go in prepared. Like there’s been a couple fights i start with hitting myself with a super stimpak.
---
I didn't do that event so I needed them.  I recently bought 2 of every plan at a vendor who had them for 2 caps each.
---
I literally gave you the literal definition of exploit and you claim that it isn't how you define exploit because of ToS. You can exploit something without violating the ToS.
---
Yeah!  It annoys me how other people play the game as well. Has a massive impact on the way I play and my enjoyment.....oh wait a minute......no it doesn’t. At all!
---
Yeah I’m on Xbox, please let me know when you’re available.(Sorry for responding late)
---
What's rule 10? Is it like rule 34?
---
How would they go about nerfing bloodied but nothing else?  It’s the build. With my bloodied build I can run a normal fixer and take out SB in seconds. The bloodied weapon is just the cherry on the top.
---
Golf.....
---
Yeah. I understand people not wanting their characters to do less damage but some of the reactions here are pretty overwrought. I did a bloodied character for a couple weeks and it was sort of boring to push buttons and watch things fall over. This will just add some spice to the game, as they might fall over a few pixels closer.
---
I have the same roll and love it. Been really trying to find a quad explosive one instead because I know they're going to nerf magic effects eventually.
---
The King is dead.
---
Long live King Junkie
---
Well you may say it's grindy but i think it will make the game more fun, most things die too easily as is. It's kinda hard to make enjoyable group content around overpowered builds.
---
I hope it will be discontinued like survival mode and vault raids.
---
If you think that melee is fine kind sir you are absolutely wrong
---
I only started playing about 2 weeks ago, so I’ve only never encountered it at the 800 limit. 
---
I’ve found it very restrictive and a strong anti-fun mechanic for me.
---
Early on, I have no idea what is valuable or not, what I’ll regret dumping later on, how the build challenges will work out, etc. 
---
Having such a restrictive cap has really had me make some choices I’ve regretted.
---
I love my repair kits for when I'm at the queen and my cyro breaks.  Rad x is ridiculous thought, I don't even use it, I use blood packs
---
So u traded for a glitched weapon and then miraculously found another 3 in a vendor lol. Wonder how your duping again now. And can you please flood the market with Uny sent:ap combat armour as well please
---
Gentlefolks, the correct term is always "yore". Even when it is not, it is.
---
Oh, well thanks I guess but Idk I thought most weapons have at least 1 skin. and I'm surprised that there wasn't any explosive Plasma rifles hmmm i should do more research
---
then executionner might be one of those bugged prefix on the heart
---
If I wanted a difficult game I'd be playing ESO, I like having one character with one specific build that I can play, win, and go play something else. If I have to constantly not switch cards, gear, and weapons for each different scenario I'm just going to uninstall and forget this game exists.
---
We already have Mole Mama Mumbles game of chance.  House wins 99% of the time.
---
Bloodied hasn’t been nerfed. High damage has. Bloodied will still be the meta. Bloodied melee instead of doing 25k damage a hit on the queen will now do 20k. It’s hardly the end of the world
---
I would love it but I would see ir happen that people with high luck increase their caps supidly fast or something like that
---
For Xbox I wish we could send out a message to everyone like "hey let's do project paradise! Who's in?" Because half the time when it pops for me I'm in my menu, or doing something and I don't notice.  Lots of times people show up 3\4 of the way in.  This is for all events, not just PP.
---
True endgame = flexing bis in trade. 
---
Domt care 5 paragraphs worth of feels for a game is me final answer 🍺
---
Well they are adding card loadouts so theres that. Also having friends helps.
---
Struggle with west tek?  Ya mad?  If the reduced the damage I put out to 25% I’d clear west tek with ease lol. It’s not even going to be noticeable for a top bloodied build unless your against the queen when the fight takes two minutes and not 45 seconds
---
Fuusball! All those power armour paints look amazing!
---
Yeah.. well.... your mom!... and such
---
Hey, if it's across the board, I'm excited. My only concern is that Bethesda will walk back the changes before I get to experience them
---
Erm. Wrong. It’s on pts. It’s nowhere near live in the game and like everything on pts May or may not be implemented or look anything like it is. They might do this and reduce bloodied to 50% damage. Or buff nocturnal to 1000%. In short. U wouldn’t have noticed any difference in the game yesterday. Today or tomorrow. Because there isn’t one
---
What about Instigating, anyone knows of this is affected as well? Or ist a flat100%  buff after all other buffs?
---
Junkies is nerfed too on the pts.
---
They're perfectly capable of wearing armor pieces. Take the late David Thorpe for example: he's decked out in Heavy Raider Armor by the time you encounter him on the quest "Key to the Past". Hell, even the perk card 'Incisor' shows a Scorched in Combat Armor.
---
Too bad Bethesda hasn't considered using it much after that, though.
---
LOVELY!
---
It's what we wanted. Teamwork and No MORE CAKEWALKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
WOOOOT. Much excite :)
---
how could that be a good thing that enemies are bullet sponges? Do you want to craft all my ammo for me? If the only challenge to a game is how much longer it takes to hold down M1 on an enemy then the game is shit.
---
"Th..ks f.. ... Steel... Dummies."
---
Stealth boys don't seem to help much as they seem to still spot me. And even if I do sneak up on them I get one hit in and they swing around and start blasting me usually ending up in a crippled limb or death because they stagger me
---
The new metal eagle as well would be nice.
---
I'm not going to get too carried away yet, I understand the changes and I'm not too fussed about the impact that they'll have. I'm aware that this will mean slightly increased ammo usage but I don't really have a problem with that.
---
We don't know much about one wasteland other than that it's a rebalance attempt and so far it's not terrible.
---
Are people going to get mad that they can't kill the queen, goatsquatch or Earle as fast? Yes! It will definitely up the challenge factor of end game builds but only marginally. I can't see it being something that we (the players) won't adapt to quickly.
---
I'm hoping that in due process the "magic damage" bug gets ironed out. I'd rather be a bloodied build doing slightly less damage with the trade off of high stats and low tankiness alongside junkies and other high health builds not doing crazy "magic"  damage than for things to stay as they are currently.
---
Maybe in the long term people will start to consider not only their own builds but also the builds they want to play alongside for boss fights and raids - actual party dynamics are fun - that guy will the full health bar over there in the power armor, yeah he doesn't do the most damage but if we're nice to him he'll res us when we need it etc
---
Let's fuck the game. AGAIN :D
---
That’s the thing. I didn’t know I was trading for a glitched weapon. I didn’t actually discover that it was glitched until after I got it and everything was said and done. When I looked in the vendor I knew it was all duped gear, but I wasn’t going to pass up on any of that stuff. Duped gear is one thing, but hackspawned items are another and that’s why I’m afraid. It looks suspicious as hell but those are the only identical weapons I’ve ever even had in this game.
---
Not really the case for a heavy gunner as I have all the damage perk cards now any extra special would just add slice of life cards
---
I have to see how quickly/easily you can swap the card loadouts on the fly before getting excited about it. Solo play all the way for me though, I just don't like playing games with others at all.
---
I had server crash problems since I changed my internet provider, then i switched from WiFi to Ethernet and now everything is fine.
---
As a non bloodied mediocre junkie I am very concerned. I suck already and this will make me suck even more. Not good. And god knows what more they end up breaking.
---
Lol. U duped. Dunno how but there’s clearly another one going around. It’s on pc tho so maybe u just figured how to glitch weapons
---
Every time I see a legendary I try to bash him as I can't even kill a level 5 scorched on a single bash. If it is inside a blob of ghouls, mirelurks or other kind of enemies and I can't get close I just equip my explosive combat shotgun and shoot at the floor. I never one shot any enemy with it and almost every shot means enemies with crippled limbs so they won't go away. Immediately after that I select the "come here" emote and wait. Sometimes while killing blobs I've accidentally killed a legendary (little bugs or low level ghouls), but I never do it on purpose. As I have a shotgun build I can't never get legendary scorched beasts loot as other players with heavy/rifle builds kill them while they are flying and I can't get enough damage, I have a really short range even with long barrel shotguns :(
---
I've been on this forum since Beta and I've heard a lot of crazy shit but buying caps?
---
Pulse grenades and mines work great against all robots. The adamantine perk prevents broken limbs or if not that at least drinking a White Russian reduced the chance of limb damage 25%.
---
And I think there’s perks that reduce stagger?
---
But I’m guessing there’s a reason why you can’t use those.
---
Damn it. Well, I still refuse to get rid of my junkie’s single-action revolver. One of these days....
---
I hope they dont do this. It will just break everything even more.
---
A core game mechanic that adds an element (lite) of resource management to an overall easy game.
---
Get FO1st if it's such an issue. 
---
downvoted for the yawn
---
How did it feel playing it? Its hard to tell how bad it is from numbers they are a lot lower just wondering how it was actually gameplay did it feel like everything was a bullet sponge or was everything dying quickly?
---
It's for the handmade not the fixer.
---
The problem is all the weapons got nerfed most builds outside of J/B is already underwhelming as is and not everyone wants to play as a team in this game all weapons should have got leveled out evenly then added or subtracted base on build and buffs not just hack damage and call it a “rebalance”
---
fuck
---
Did you read my post? I'm not complaining about I can't oneshot everything with my bloodied handmade now. I'm saying that they made most weapons (weapons, not legendary effects) useless with this change.
---
Most weapons (specially weapons with really low base damage) could be used thanks to bloodied and all the multipliers you could end having for running with low health, but now that they've changed those multipliers and the base damage for those weapons are still the same they've made them unusable.
---
They've killed all weapons that weren't considered op weapons, killing all the weapon variety.
---
Well, did this fix magic damage at least or is it still there?
---
great post. You get it. bleaters be bleating
---
I feel you, I really do but ultimately we just looking at using a bit more ammo which isn't really the end of the world! I've found that playing in teams it doesn't really matter that much, I mean farming won't really be affected much... a few extra shots needed. Big deal. Everyone will just be doing whatever they're best at. I'd love to have some tankier teammates - junkies, medics builds would be cool... Nobody wants to pay someone that guy/girl that one shots everything anyway...
---
If you have the video please post it im sure we would all like to see it.
---
It's just hard to believe because I've never seen anyone produce a video of this bug. Other then one but the person wasn't at their base.
---
I'm not saying it doesn't exist or you're lying. It's just in the early days of the game there was a rumour that you could take everything from players with some type of trade glitch. Because of those I ignored trading for the first year or so of the game. That rumour turned out to be untrue.
---
lol. right on
---
Make it a player camp item.  
---
Let me set up a slot machine with my own rewards that I can put in.
---
Also make it a separate "stash" for caps so that we can let people play, and pick it out later so that we aren't going over the MAX constantly.
---
law suit here we come. if you thought that loot boxes was funny business, wait until they see this.
---
No. Just learn to play the game without focusing solely on getting currency.
---
Im already there :P It takes me 4-5 shots to down a super mutant. Maybe 3 if stealth bonus decides to work. In events I do extremely little. And now I get to do even less? This will not be fun.
---
Bloodied &amp; junkies should do more damage due to the negatives. I run 3 bloodied characters &amp; think the changes are good. You shouldn't be able to one or two shot everything in game.
---
Because they are bleaters.
---
I am very excited for these changes.
---
Bloodied main myself.
---
Looking forward to blinging out PA properly now.
---
You're not wrong, some weapon damage balancing would be great! Hopefully this is just a starting point to make all of that easier in future...
---
Am I to optimistic?
---
No. It’s because you only want to engage with a same aspect of the game. Namely grinding out for gear to make your character Uber one shot kill wonders. 
---
That’s what these complaints always come down too.
---
Okay, cool!
---
It would be fine if the weeklies just held most of the score 90/10 or at worst 80/20 and doing all weeklies guaranteed you to hit 100 but if people wanna do bonus dailies they can
---
Sounds fun
---
Yes. This will break everthing. Doors will not open anymore and your stash will be lost. Ghouls become invulnerable execpt when shot with a 44 etc. This is Bethesda.
---
All you have to do is go read the reddit forums for those games and find out for yourself
---
I do I play all day everyday just end up with loads of scrip weapons even after having loads away and selling them to vendors. I'm sitting on 1087 bullion tickets the current system does not work.
---
That doesn't mean can can't do awesome crowd control at events... That helps! You can take pylons at the encrypted event, that helps too!
---
Well I just got to work and wont be home for 7 hours. Gt is rammadeus. Just send me a message on xbox when you're on and I'll get back to you
---
So well said. Fallout 76 is a great game with an epic setting and tons of funny stories.
---
What is current ruining it, is players playing it a way is was not meant.
---
We see a lot of OP builds, being it bloodied or what not. People playing this style are taking the fun out of the game.
---
It’s not fun to see a queen go down in 10sec, it’s not funny the see legendary creatures going down in 1 shot in events.
---
The game was not designed to be played like that.
---
Yes it’s possible, but why do it, why remove the challenge and the fun for the other players.
---
I welcome Bethesda to nerf the damage output, let’s get the game balanced and back to what it was intended to be.
---
Post the recording that you‘re claiming to have. Thank you very much!
---
You can buy bulk steel from all vendors(if youre not worried about caps) or i usually farm liberators at vault 76
---
&gt; Most days, the challenges take me 10-20 minutes.
---
I just wanted to ask you about this specific part. You go from 0% XP towards the next level, to 100% XP towards the next level, in less than 20 minutes?
---
Is this with a massive INT from an Unyielding build and all the possible INT buffs, and +100% from junkboxes, or is this with a regular (&lt;=15 INT) build and just the +5% XP buff from a bed?
---
Or, are you rolling throwaway alts to go do the levelup and if so, what's your route?
---
Also, just out of curiosity, do you also go from 0% towards the next Overseer level to 100% towards the next Overseer level in under 20 minutes, and if so, how do you manage that? I personally find it taking something like 10 minutes from hopping in the queue to loading in to the actual action in a Nuclear Winter match.
---
I'm just curious, because the level up and raise your Overseer rank -challenges seem to take me quite a bit longer than just 20 minutes, so I'd love to know how I can get them down to that kind of speed.
---
Also...
---
&gt; Stop complaining about how burnt out you are from the Legendary Run.
---
It's called "feedback". It is what Bethesda asked, and wants from us. They've said several times that this is a game that they're trying to change and fine-tune based on player feedback.
---
If people are getting burnt out because there are challenges that are available every day, and only for that day, that award points towards rewards, which then makes people feel like they have to do those challenges or they'll miss out on those rewards, because it's not immediately apparent how many days and how many challenges we can actually skip to still reach level 100, then they're absolutely free to point out that they're getting burnt out by the system, and in fact, that's what they should be doing.
---
Let me ask you... Can you give me one reason why you would rather have challenges and/or other reward-based content that is only available for 24 hours and then if you missed it, you missed it forever, *instead* of those challenges and that content being available for example for the remainder of that ongoing week, so that if you've got a life, work, school, and so on, and can't log in every single day, you can do the content you missed on, for example, the weekend?
---
I was thinking (and I'm sure a million other people before me have thought of this as well) of a system where the daily challenges pop up daily, just like they do now, but instead of them disappearing daily, they would remain until the weekly reset. Would that be a worse system than what we have now, and if so, why?
---
Finally a reasonable person, I personally don't utilize any meta build, I try fun things. like right now I converted from an instigating lever action/Explosive Handmade to a Gatling Explosive. I found someone who was selling a 1-star Explosive Gatling Gun for 2K caps, its been a great experience using the weapon. I can 4 or 5 shot pretty much any enemy without needing worry about stealth. I gave my cousin a two-shot Gatling Gun that i had in my stash and we have been having such a great time. The Gatling Boys. I perfect build isn't need it to enjoy the game, i don't even have a full set of matching Armor. Level 182.
---
Many such cases as well. Laser rifles for example still break down extremely fast, especially with the bugged beam splitter. Sad!
---
Oh yeah and the queen will always be immortal t-posing...
---
Should build on the roof of your base using the upper floor tiles. Saves alot of space
---
Yay? (I have no chance of surviving that :P)
---
See I agree that bloodied is too op, one-shotting an enemy like deathclaw or behemoth is quite insane imo since they were quite tough back in fallout 4. Being able to one-shot those big creatures certainly made the game less challenging.
---
BUT A "60%"(∈ ℝ) DAMAGE NERF??? WOW, see I get that they nerf all the weapons, and I get that bloodied is still one of the best build after the nerf, but 60%?? Many players spent hours and hours, thousands and thousands of caps on collecting a full set of unyielding armor, leveling up to get perks for bloodied, scripping for a desired bloodied weapon, etc. Now they are just gonna nerf it?? Listen, the correct way to nerf bloodied is to nerf a bit of damage (30% for example), then most importantly, nerf the SURVIVABILITY of the bloodied build. Bloodied build is op not just because of the damage of a bloodied weapon, but also because of how tanky a bloodied character can become. Make a bloodied character die easier, instead of making every enemy a  bullet sponge again. See in Fallout 4, I don't mind enemies being bullet sponge, instead I try to make them bullet sponge by using difficulties mod. But that's because im Fallout 4 I can use whatever weapons I want without worrying about the carry weight, I can become an all-rounder, I can use cool mod weapons. But in Fallout 76, it's obvious that the game wants you to be specialized by implementing this perk card system, which I don't mind except it's really stupid that we can't reset our perks all at once... Anyways, I like the idea of being specialized, but what I expect from being specialized and giving up being an all-rounder is that I'll perform REALLY WELL by being specialized for a certain build. If I want to be tanky, I should be able to survive attacks from 10+ charred ghouls at once, because I give up the choice to do insane damage and kill them before they ever notice me. If I want to be a stealth commando, I should be able to kill any enemy quickly, because I give up the choice to be super tanky. This is a simple concept where if you make players forgone something, you have to give them something back in return. In the case of bloodied players, "damage" is that something that they desire for.
---
I understand that they want to make the game more challenging to extend the playing time. But this is NOT the endgame we asked for, the endgame we asked for are things like new boss events, new enemies... It'll be really frustrating for many players if they can't defeat an enemy that they have already defeated before. To he honest, I would be much happier if they just buff enemies in certain areas instead, make enemies in certain areas more deadly, this is a better way to bring motivations for players to get better gears, to play longer. I remember a game I played when I was a child, what that game did to make people play longer is that they make our damage looks 10x more, but also make hp of every creatures 10x more, so there was no difference really, but it did make quite some people play the game for a longer time. The key takeaway here is that: don't try to take things away from players, instead add new things to the game to trick players into thinking that they are gaining something.
---
(But honestly they can do whatever they want to the game since I haven't played fo76 for two weeks and the only time I logged on was to build my camp so this combat system overhauled won't affect me. I'm fine as long as they don't remove the double wal...... 
---
wait...
---
oh fridge you Bethesda)
---
I need a place to spend all my caps on drugs, alcohol and hookers. Dont look at me like that you'd do that to in a nuclear apocalypse.
---
Probably :S
---
I didn't grind gear I grind outfits and use weapons as trades. But I respect your opinion
---
Seems like a very lazy fix for this unbalanced game. As usual. Well... many are getting fed up with all the chores in this game anyway. This might finally push me and others the better games. So might be a good thing
---
yeah. this is just one big really bad idea.
---
But this is not the way of balancing the game. Especially since it’s introduced so late now.
---
This will surely piss of the entire playerbase
---
Not really. Nobody and I mean nobody was seriously using a bloodied shovel in melee seriously. And the less the base damage. The less the overall decrease in damage. So most heavily reduced in damage will be the handmade and the powerfist less so the combat rifle and the shovel.
---
Afterwards you can stir your bloodied mates - they can't do their thing without crowd control... Goat doesn't die if nobody grabs a pylon
---
Dont do this Bethesda!
---
Fixer Base Damage + Hardened + Riflemen + Rifleman 2 + Riflemen 3 + Bloodied Mess + Reverent + Adrenaline + Adrenal Reaction 79% HP (Strange in Numbers) + Junkie’s
---
48 + 12 + 9.6 + 9.6 + 9.6 + 7.2 + 24 + (4.8x6=28.8) + 4.8 + 24 = 177.6 
---
Original Damage = 406.08
---
43.7% Nerf (Give or take a few rounding errors)
---
That being said, if this is what there doing to junkies. This game is lost. 
---
All they had to do, was nerf bloodied effect by 50%, nerf junkies by 1 addiction, and nerf berserkers by 25%.
---
Buffed Slayers 20% and buffed mutants by making it per mutation with a steep curve and go from there.
---
Once again every build gets nerfed because of the one primary problematic build.
---
No such thing as a 1* explosive Gatling. Explosive is a 2nd star effect.
---
Lone wanderer is useless now that Public teams and inspirational exist
---
What!? That’s an amazing find! Have you let bethesda know, I’m sure they have no idea about this...
---
Does this mean that anti armour weapons may become a better alternative?
---
Rather than nerfing things they should buff the others. 
---
Assassins should be increased to 30%
---
Mutants should give 10% per mutation up to a max of 60% (or 6 mutations)
---
Beserkers should have  a significant increase of up to 100% if wearing no armour, meaning that it will be a good option, but at a cost.
---
The opposite of bloodied - purified. Does more damage the higher your health is (but up to 60% extra so that it isnt as powerful cause you dont have a health deficit)
---
I’m actually stoked for the daily ops, it sounds super challenging so I hope there’s some good rewards
---
This. Exactly how a dungeon build should work
---
Gonna be trying this out later
---
Sure i'll join some adventures, but if it gets weird im out lol PSN: GamerRKO
---
Ahhhh so technically its still the best just everything hits less now?
---
I hope junkie is a still very good option otherwise i stop playing it dont wanna waste another year just for farming and trading the same weapons with other effects. Just no beth
---
I need this
---
"Nobody". Okay. I did, because I was able. With this change I can't.
---
You buy them with gold. Have to finish the wastelanders quest first. The guy Sam in Foundation sells them.
---
oof, yeah.  That's like 70-90 lbs of stash space per suit if stored as pieces depending on type.
---
Awesome, thank you so much. :)
---
I think these changes will kill the game probably
---
Go with carrots, they work amazingly well.
---
The overseers camp might be better as all knew players go there. Also around Flatwoods or the Wayward.
---
I'm with you, I'm not a regular here, nor am I a "hardcore" FO76 player, I simply have too much real life to invest that kind of time and effort into the grossly mutated, mentally debilitated, incarnation of my favorite game franchise. Hell, I half flat-out hate Bethesda for FO76. All most of us wanted was an MMO open world version of FO4, or NV if we're being honest, instead we have some jackass' detached interpretation of what FO fans like, wrapped up in a bunch of nostalgic iconography lifted and then misunderstood from FO1 &amp; 2 by a corporate marketing division, and then "slathered" with a hefty portion of mobile, ad-based, gaming paradigms.   
---
It became crystal clear within 3 months of general release that no effort was going to be spent in evolving the game, one that potentially could have been groundbreaking, great, and universally beloved, into at least a semblance of the consensual "ideal" of a Fallout online game as communicated for **years** by the fan base. And many of us poo-poo'd the initial harsh critics (who themselves were speaking from a position of deep disappointment, themselves being fans who also understood the vast potential being flushed). But man, in the past year or so since release, as a person who very much wanted this shit to work, all I can say is "fuck."   
---
At first it was easy enough to disregard the blatant cash-grab qualities and quirkily irritating bugs that affect even the most basic and fundamental mechanics of the game. Because we could still more or less have a pretty enjoyable time ignoring the "game" while wandering around the map or building a camp up. But once these (completely out of place and more or less inappropriate) "battle pass" changes kicked in, it just fizzled. And, now, seeing that the second battle pass season is literally just a massively uninteresting grind with the sole object being to get rewards for wasting one's life in the form of cosmetics and junk, I mean what the fuck eh?

So thanks Bethesda, for buying up an incredible IP and over a little more than a decade, destroying that IP. You've made a mockery of the entire premise by dumbing it down to be appealing to the lowest common denominator while outright ignoring, and at times denigrating, a passionately involved fan base that have, at every point, indicated with specificity basic actions that could have been taken to make/keep such an amazing opportunity as FO76 a profitable and respectable game. The simple logistical decision to hand this game over to a bunch of industry nobodies/newbies itself was a slap in the face. The conversion to what is almost guaranteed to become an ad-driven "free" game is just icing on the shit cake. Bethesda is not the company it once was. And it is extremely disappointing that they own the rights to such beloved game franchises as we can never expect to see anything worthwhile produced by them.  
---
Fucking RadAway and Rad X as rewards. Insulting.
---
You used, as your main weapon, all the time, a shovel.
---
Probably is what they were wearing before the bombs dropped and that just a pristine one not being used by a mole miner.
---
Just like everything else would since the game launched. 
---
Maybe it’ll just get ride of the crappy players who only know how to spray billets everywhere while always in PA and one shot legendary killing.
---
I'd love a slot machine vending machine that can award prizes set by players... But it sounds like it would be really subject to cheating.
---
So I’m new to fo76 I played a few free plays in the past and now play on Xbox game pass brutal I don’t see the issue with nerfing these builds many a time before purchasing fo1st I would be farming one violent night with my group on for some Tesla rifle or nuke wielding ass hat comes in and one shots the night stalker and most of legendary Enemies that spawned with it.
---
This is awful
---
Thanks
---
I would love this!
---
" It also seems like this isn't working as it should either as damage numbers seem even less than that."
---
So has anybody so far worked back through the figures by taking off the damage multipliers separately what with there being so many with Bloodied builds, checking the damage figure each time, all the way back to when the only thing they have adding damage is the weapon legendary effect itself, then one without mods, then a normal non legendary version of that weapon, to see how all the figures match up and what isn't actually working?
---
Never said that, but clearly being downvoted got you upset enough to not read. I'm done trying to debate whether or not using the game's mechanics the way they were intended is an exploit. Even the Miriam-Webster definition, claiming it has to be "mean" or "unfair" is not met, but you're going to latch on to me also mentioning that it isn't an exploit in violation of the terms of service. What an absolute waste of energy. Best of luck with your semantic debates.
---
This is not as bad as you'll think it is.
---
They are doing the Ground work for One Wasteland probablly. It was about to happen anyways, Some builds  are insanley OP in the past few months -in order to make challanging end game, you need to adjust things that player cannot one shot anything they come across.
---
The Dmg Output Gap between a Level 40 and a dud Level 60 with all Mutations and Unyielding Armor and Bloodied Guns are too afra from each other.
---
On one side you want a strong-ish Charaiter Build but there needs to be a normalizations for further balance.
---
Dont see this as a final nerf and a nail in the coffin but rather a nuking to start from scratch.
---
I would definitely love the option to make legendary weapons of regular craftable weapons like Pump Shotguns or Miniguns, spending 5 or so Legendary Modules to get a randomly rolled 1\*, 2\*, or 3\*, just like the Wastelanders armor and weapons.
---
Would make good use of the resources I never use in my Stash anyways.
---
My best haul was 89 legendaries (kills, not found loot). I still use my Vampire tesla that I got from it, all other were junk.
---
This is a tough nerf, why didn't they nerf bloodied and Junkies a little bit and just buffed other builds. That mutants legendary effect sucks ass, it doesn't need to be as good as bloodied or junkies because it doesn't have big negative effects but instead of 10% it could be 30 or 35%. Or give a 8% damage boost up to 32% for every mutation you have.
---
Probably because M.O.N.E.Y. smh...
---
I’m sure they know first part and they didn’t fix it on update 21
---
They don’t have the damage in comparison to bloodied no but that’s because that’s way OP. I run full health heavy on my main and easily hit 70-80 on the queen which is fine when I’m dumping 150-200 rounds a minute. And I’ve never seen anyone really use anything other than handmades and fixers on bloodied. Maybe this is what’s needed to make people try different builds and different weapons. I’m sorry it’s taking away some of the joy you got from your build but I think it’s needed to readdress balance across builds.
---
That one guy that duped 690420 dog tags is one happy cunt.

I'll check when i get home from work.

Are you on Xbox if not I will do this for you on Xbox
---
Ran the Colossus on the PTS earlier. It's still entirely doable, nothing felt particularly spongy
---
Meta builds aren't "needed" for anything. It's nice to never have a Queen fight fail, but it's by no means necessary.
---
well so far its only in the Test servers and from all i heard, noone really enjoys the change
---
so its definitely possible that when the devs see the negative reactions they might overthink the changes
---
The difference between bloodied/junkies and everyone else is just becoming narrower. Those two are still the best, just not by the huge margin they were before.

My god! Explosive pipe revolvers will be meta
---
Or, I could have a current conversation with people here...in a Reddit forum.
---
You are completely incorrect!!! There have been so many post debunking this theory. I"ve experienced only one constant in all the fights since patch 19. RNG....
---
How about we leave nukashine at the overseers &amp; the loot at all of the places you can teleport to.
---
I'm just laughing at all the people who paid real world money for bloodied 25/25 guns right now 🤣. This post is why you NEVER spend real world money on changeable things.
---
People are more than welcome to dump your caps to me, and I will then draw cards over the mic for you to pick higer or lower, if you get it wrong I keep the caps, if you get it right, it costs you the caps to play....

Only your going to get a very skewed view of this game vs other games. Take duping in this game. It’s a problem. Yet even games like Animal Crossing has problem with duping. 
---
But here it seems like people think only this game has duping problems.
---
I like increase stash and reduce our carry weight to make game more real
---
Pipe...  
---
Pipe is life.
---
Thats the point. People only talk about bloodied but dont understand that evers dmg output got nerfed. Sorry i dont wannt to farm much more lead and sorry there are so many mobs spawning  at some events 
---
I dont want to struggle with evey no armed melee scorched
---
Haha, I've encountered it once too. There's also a dead body with a peculiar note on it xD
---
Sounds nice, until you realize that communication in FO76 is nearly non existent.
---
Yes, there is speech-support, but it seems that the audio engine is fucked up, too.
---
On the fly switching to headphones kills the sound completely. Thinking about using a second soundcard or an usb-headset while the game sound is on the the loudspeakers? Not going to happen.
---
While I'd love to get more teamwork, I'll see loads of frustration ahead, until every one learned the mechanics...
---
I made a post asking for if bloodied was knocked down to lift the neglected ones and got downvoted to hell lol.
---
Someone, a junkies heavy, yaknow magic damage, was saying that 5 bullets isn’t too much for an enemy. With the plasma caster, it is.
---
I strongly believe the devs dont thought about it
---
I think maybe reducing the multipliers would be good I don’t know what they are and I think buffing mutant weapons would be nice like +5% damage per mutation you have so it’s not just +10% no matter the amount of mutations
---
Maybe allow us to have stash perks weapons wait reduction or chems etc.
---
I ran like 6 of them today, bloodied commando with thorns armor and vanguard commando with SS. It's tough, it's hectic, and it's totally doable. Actually got a paladin rank solo with the bloodied one during a freezing supermutant round. The toughest so far fast a round with robots that could only be killed with melee. I could damage them down to a sliver but had to bash to kill. Really enjoyed them a lot!
---
All damage was changed on how it’s calculated. Not just bloodied.
---
You didn't know people play on Console?
---
If you bother to read the PTS notes you see that they nerfed every single prefix by changing how damage is calculated (from multiplicative to additive). It's not just bloodied.
---
I sell all my rad-x pills to npc's as soon as I get them. Have zero use for them.
---
Radaways I sell about 100-200 per week to npc's. Seem to get it all the time from all over.
---
Really do not need a new way to get them.
---
Thought that was your listed damage and I wasn’t believing it’s that bad. That seems reasonable
---
Logically, they add leg perk to make 90% more bullets, so, they must nerf everything to take 90% more bullets to kill. Bethesda thinking.
---
what do you mean the update nobody wanted?
---
we all wanted more challenge and content.
---
Pulse capacitor, flamer barrel, Rifleman perks. Go nuts
---
Oh really? So everything will drop in relation? Meaning bloodied will still be on top for damage output?
---
I saw someone post a photo of bloodied handmade and before the damage was 297 and after nerf its like 179!
---
It's just about like you can expect them to make the worst decision 75 percent of the time.
---
I really need to see what taking up so much space in my stash I took all my weapons and I was still at 600 ish but I collect outfits maybe need a dump of stuff.
---
I just drop stuff that no high lvl really want (apart from those assholes who take everything and resell 10 times overpriced) in luggage next to nearest train stations, some plans, water, booze, unused ammo, don't drop meds/chems tho, only personally. But a lot of players actually prefer to make their way on their own, so did I when I started playing so I don't give too much, otherwise the feeling of survival is just lost.
---
Reduce the damage buff from things like nerd rage
---
I do this in UF. Bash a legendary, use the 'come here' emote so everyone can get a hit in, watch as one guy one instakills it anyway.
---
Hope you don't mind my raider trader stealing this idea.
---
This is why I kept my best nonbloodied gear.  I never trusted them to NOT screw up bloodied someday.   Or anything else.    Will be pulling my two vampire pieces out of vending into my own stash just in case.
---
Which affects any buikd that runs low health. Which is the meta. Not just bloodied. Junkies low health build is really high damage. Nerd rage and adrenal reaction paired are a massive boost. Now it’s just been reduced somewhat but it affects every build at low health
---
English is not my first language... What does "detriate" mean?
---
You're hopeless.ever heard of buying something with your saved currency? Whatever, enjoy your 4 years grind.
---
Im with you buddy
---
And actually i would like to see some balance improvments but tbh i dont think that the devs can do it. Because nerfing everthing is just a bad way do balance a game
---
Edit: they need to take a deep look into every weapon. I know this is gonna need much time but its the only way imo to improve the balance in f76
---
I have it on console?
---
Yeah I’m on xbox my gt is sugarqueen18518 if that’s ok
---
Nice, I also finished my blue ridge store a few days ago but this build really puts it to shame 😅
---
congratulations?
---
This kinda happened to me in NW or something similar I just couldn’t fire and kept aiming down sights no matter what then I died cause I was mid fight
---
Magic weapons still work.
---
The wallpaper bug is unrelated and super old.
---
What's changed?
---
I’m lucky and got a few decent guns, like a VFFR gauss mini, and a variety of AA, many explosive guns etc. but getting as many BE weapons as possible will be sad when they are no longer pure gold
---
Wow man, even if it's already solved, A+ for effort. I put less work into college. Good on you.
---
sarcasm, right?
---
I don't why but this reminds me of a meme with that white cat behind a table and 2 women xD Great shot!
---
Pazaak though...
---
Sure,I bet you legendary player can support the atoms shop and 1st by yourself. Let's get rid of everyone!
---
I imagine a lead dev is afraid of spiders
---
I totally understand this "balance change", definetely something had to be done, but was this the best way to do it? I don't think so.
---
This balance change is really lazy. They changed how the multipliers work without caring about anything else, expecting that everything was going to remain the same and it isn't.
---
They should have revisited all weapons and see if their base damage should be tweaked to match better this new change, and actually rebalance all the weapons one by one so most weapons don't become useless after this change.
---
And One Wasteland isn't helping neither. Who thought it was a good idea nerfing everything, and right after that make all enemies are even harder to kill. It only makes this problem worse.
---
bethesda needs to remove the hard cap limit first.
---
it used to be you could always release an arrow at any time you released the trigger. Now, you can only release in a full draw, which when you dont exactly pull it to 100%, it just cancels the shot... it is as frustrating as jt sounds
---
So much drama! Lol. Look people have been making all kinds of doom predictions before the game was even launched.
---
Lmao so am i, nothing id love more than to absolutely melt one with a gatling laser
---
Hey! 1 type of arachnid is enough!
---
Low health builds did benefit the most from the multiplicatively stacking buffs, for the reason that they have the most of them. And the change makes the ceiling lower in general, because there are diminishing returns compared to how it was calculated before. In other words, low health will still have the highest damage, but by a smaller margin than before. All in all, I think it is a good change overall, even if it does not make a really large difference. Similar modifications could also have been made to how damage reduction (by a percentage) is applied, so that by stacking it the player does not become almost invincible.
---
Sniff sniff ....

I’m glad we don’t have snakes
---
I’m up for it.  
---
If it encourages us to work as teams more (even silent teams in public parties) - Good
---
If it encourages us to try different strategies and maybe every rely more on consumables - Good
---
Not All of my characters I play are bloodied (only one is) the other 3 I typically play do fine right now.  If this pushes me to try to refine my builds, make sure to hunt down the best armor and weapon mods - good
---
Nice!     
---
How did it occur to you to take the first letter of each word?  How did you realize it was a Caeser cipher?
---
I wonder the same, I once found someone's loot bag with lots of junk, I picked it all only to find 5k large handmade presents in my inventory among all junk. I confess I never was lucky in this game so this felt like Christmas. I didn't use them tho, but kept the junk and learned some plans, dumped the rest. Now I wonder if I'm at risk of ban too. Oh well.
---
wow. that seems terrific.
---
Time to actually think about my power armor build!!
---
BEAR ARMS....dust yourself off boy!! you're up!!
---
This on ps4? Yuck definitely gonna carry my be flamer around with me now took me a lot of luck and trading to get that and even with the damage nerf coming thats probably my best weapon, cant imagine how heart wrenching it is to find all your weapons and armour you invested time into getting just disappearing like that. Any tips on how to prevent it?
---
I'm putting my money on the death claw. Now two yao guai against a death claw, you got my attention.
---
Yhe anti stealth is a permanent perk in the ops.
---
The level 35 can’t 1-shot me if it can never find me, I still say unyielding is a bigger issue than the bloodied damage.
---
It needs 2 Casinos!
---
One run by a savvy but ruthless Englishman, by the name of Ellis Cussengen who runs an established casino, 'The Ruby Tavern'
---
The other by a newcomer in town, Mom Tiller, running the 'The Stellar Fraternity'.
---
Assuming several guys in PA don't completely block your access to it.
---
Could we have PvP card games please? Just simple ones like Blackjack and Five Card Draw.
---
So f annoying.
---
Don't
---
CHEERS
---
Whats the point, they Will never increase cap limit again...
---
You mean the MG08/15? That one can be carried and operated by one dude.
---
Yeah but i wholeheartedly agree with you! We need more chinese commie themed weapon skins. Imagine a Chinese commie Shovel and Pickaxe skin! XD
---
People don’t like being punished for behaviours people do like being rewarded for behaviours 
---
In other words reward your players for doing what you want instead of punishing them for doing what you don’t want them to do
---
&gt;But a lot of players actually prefer to make their way on their own, so did I when I started playing so I don't give too much, otherwise the feeling of survival is just lost.
---
Like the saying goes, give a man a fish - he eats for a day, teach a man to fish, he eats for a lifetime.

I personally prefer to give advice to new players rather than outright give them gear.

This makes me sad and yet explains so much about many of the people who play this game.
---
It's how she asserts her dominance.
---
Thanks for your comment in a sea of negativity due to a fear of the unknown.
---
l'm a Xbox player so don't have access, but I see this as a positive move. Lets face it, the game is way to easy if you have decent items &amp; build. When players can solo the queen in 50 seconds or less - then something needs to change.
---
Australia, probably
---
Yeah, exactly. If my friend is starting to play I do exactly that (with some extra loot but still). It's kinda hard to do with random newbies tho, because you don't know if they speak English or even have their voice chat on. But I totally agree with you.
---
I have recently been playing Obsidians Grounded game. The spiders are terrifying in that game, even though they’re slightly cartoony. The game actually has arachnophobia settings to make the spiders look less like spiders for people with genuine fear. 
---
I think they’d be brilliant in this game and even more scary.  I’ve had this conversation before, they could climb shit to negate jetpack/marsupial cheese or web you up.
---
Those fuckers are in Australia. And I'm not just talking about in the Fallout universe.
---
This would be awesome as a Halloween thingy. Have Wendigo's  walk around in clown consumes and the like.
---
Irradiated spiders?
---
Fuck right off!
---
What is jet pack am confused. Is for t-65?
---
Well, good news is bloodied is still OP haha
---
Yeah it's quite dissapointing.
---
It feels kinda dumb as Scorched humans wear nothing but Civilian clothing, yet they are able withstand Gauss gun rounds...
---
They would look more intimidating if they could wear armor pieces. I mean imagine a Scorched wearing full heavy combat armor + helmet and wielding an automatic assault rifle on one hand. Scary stuff.
---
Thats exactly why we need them, nobody wants to encounter them, you thought running into a wendigo was bad...
---
ive been testing this with my high and low health builds. its much less fun, its not harder. its just more grind.
---
its not the bloodied people who really get screwed either, sure the nerf is dramatic, but its the people will builds that just get by with general mobbing that get hurt, not low health.
---
this change pushed everyone down, and that means tons of builds and gear right on the margin just got wiped out.
---
Build a man a fire he will be warm for the night. Set a man on fire he will be warm for the rest of his life.

Sorry, I couldn't resist.....
---
Mid level players?   They're high enough to do a silo but don't have the really good weapons/perks yet to bring down the vertibots that easily.   I remember getting the card was pretty difficult for me when I was doing the main quest line.... hundreds of levels ago.
---
enemies you kill drop the ammo they‘ve been killed with now, did you miss that? did daily ops today on the PTS, and any mutant i killed with ultracite 5.56 also dropped at least 10 ultracite rounds each. we‘re getting ammo, don‘t worry.
---
Aren’t the ants adorable though?
---
Yeah the LMG aka MG42 needs some love!
---
* Few mods
---
* A commie themed skin
---
This is an amazing news in all the other bad ones.
---
They aren’t nerfing the ones I use.
---
Oof
---
This update should have been day 1. As a level 20 I should NEVER have to fight a level 60.
---
make sure you report it on the PTS forums. sounds like a bug to me
---
Guys, it may not be lazy as much as not knowing for some people.
---
those get effected too lmao
---
Interesting how doing less damage arrived nearly at the same time as the legendary double ammo perk ;) the only thing that's gonna have my bloody char quaking in my boots is a group of high level anglers or floaters as it is gonna take longer to drop them all. Ah well at least I wont have any extra stimpacks anymore gonna need them XD
---
They actually are. It’s a shame to kill them sometimes, except when they’re stealing your shit. 
---
Once they add the ability to pet them it’s GotY.
---
That's on you not loading out properly for the silo run.
---
We need them to be at least more challenging. not less.
---
Not this again. "Muh wep got nerfed so I'm done"
---
I have always wondered if I was a good or crappy player as a pa heavy guns build. Now I know, thanks.

Spiders?.. I see your Spiders, and raise you Centipedes...

When listening to the Encrypted Broadcast, it just sounded like a variation of the phonetic alphabet was being used (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta etc.) and I know that when you use the phonetic alphabet, you’re only using it so that the first letter of each word can’t be misinterpreted.

For the Caeser cipher, that’s just the first cipher to try when decoding things, it’s the most basic out of all of the ciphers and luckily for me, it was the one that was used too.

DON'T
---
I'm also xbox so I'm in the same boat, but I agree the "magic" weapon thing needs to be fixed. I'm a bloodied stealth cammando with B2525 fixer which imo is the strongest biuld out there and It still take me like 5 min per queen the 60 sec and understand shouldn't be possible
---
I heard theres a time limit to get the better stuff, would you say it's fairly achievable for the average player to do comfortably or was it a real struggle?
---
I remember that dlc on ps4. I was super exited to build a vault,only to realize I had a massive cavern but the budget could have barely covered 20% of it.

This time i'd rather have a premade interior I only have to decorate and fill up to the brim.
---
I’ve seen you on my platform killing queens , you are a beast !
---
Then ...  my berseker E handmade is good now?
---
no you don't.
---
didn;t get any myself for a while, the yesterday 3. crap effects and rolls but still....bodes well for the future
---
Party time!
---
oooor they could just revert and not make the changes this way. maybe actual attempt to make other builds better *before* nerfing the living shit out of everything and calling it a day lol.
---
Let’s see what ranged three star weapon I’ll get this time!
---
*gets a Broadsider*
---
Awww damn....
---
Short version.  It’s totally inconsistent. 
---
It’s not while at night. It’s not during Heart of the Swamp. 
---
I’ve personally had the most success during Verdant season, but even then it’s at best 50%
---
The only 100% guaranteed way, is to have a character that’s at the stage of the quest to pick Strangler blooms, but they don’t pick/ craft Radshield. That way every time they log in, the game has to make them bloom for the quest, then other characters/ players can pick and craft them.
---
Tell them your feedback. This is important
---
Next season friend next season
---
Well every event I go to, the players in PA with their heavy guns sit there and spray ammo like they are trouts in mating season. And tend not to be that effective. My favorite was at Line in the Sand. The guy just stood there trying to kill one scorched that was taking cover. 
---
He just blew through so much ammo. Because his idea of how to play. I revived him twice. The third time he went down I just stood next to him but didn’t revive him. 
---
He was level 240+
---
And he’s not the first time I’ve had this experience. 
---
The players who think murder hobo is the solution to everything in the game tend to be the worst to play with.
---
I looked at your post history. Lots of adds in the market for ammo. So yeah I get a sense of how you probably approach everything in the game.
---
If you can’t be bothered, wait for double xp and grind events. I went up 20-30 levels a time doing that.
---
My vffr 10mm auto pistol is my favorite sidearm. Use it to tag legendaries as well
---
And what exactly are those "so many ways", given the current engine limitations? We have enemies that are more difficult to hit/damage for periods of time (SBQ), people complain that she isn't always on the ground for them to whale on. We have a boss that requires teamwork to damage (ISS), and people keep complaining about that being too hard on bad servers. The vault raids tried infinite waves and timers, both of which showed to be a very bad design for a game as buggy and laggy as this. 
---
This didn't affect bloodied nearly enough to make people switch, it's still the #1 damage dealer and still has all its synchronizations like unyielding and serendipity, but now the gap between a bloodied build and any non-bloodied build is slightly lower. At least that's a baby step in the right direction
---
As I understand it from the datamines, you have the same loot pool with all tiers, just higher chances at the rare rewards. And it's certainly tough solo. I frankly didn't expect to get a sub 8 minute run that quickly but I'm also pretty well geared out (all uny thorns armor, b2525 fixer). It's a good level of challenge, but it's not unapproachable. I would expect to see most people able to clear it in the sub 12 minute range without too much hastle
---
seems like it.
---
high levels enemies were levels 50 75 and 100.
---
the lower levels areas seem to not scale correctly at this point however. capping at 25.
---
Meh.

The main one is people on top of the roof or fence at v9. You can tell as she is staying up in the air facing said characters. As soon as she changes target to someone in the open she tends to land

If you’re in a Team Chose a Perk to share (on Pc access your perk deck, select a perk and press T) might seem lame but it is actually very useful no matter what perk you share.

Well a couple of weeks ago i decided to make my first bloodied build, I guess since they will probably make the change before i complete it I won't really miss out on much
---
Oh I got my first pie yesterday in The Purveyor!!
---
one of my builds is junkie commando and big gun, its seeing an effective damage output reduction of 15-30% depending on the scenario. its not insignificant, in fact its enough to make the build overall, much less fun to play. its by no means not usable, but its just less fun with nothing compelling added to it.
---
It makes damage differences between builds all around lower. That in theory already encourages trying more builds, since the player is not punished as hard for not maximizing damage buffs at all costs. For example, if Bloody Mess 3 now only adds 0.15 to the overall (already high) damage multiplier, rather than multiplying it by 1.15, then it becomes less of a "mandatory" perk, and those points could also be spent on something else instead.

there's a Power Armor display in the ATX for the upcoming releases.

Sounds doable then not as high damage as that being a heavy gunner pa user but it all being in the loot pool means I should get there eventually thanks for the reply :) quick question on the thorn armour though is it decent? I always thought it was more for melee users or does it add damage to range attacks?
---
Mr. House was sleeping by the FO76 time period. From what I remember he “crashes” while protecting Vegas from The Great War and doesn’t wake up for 61 years.
---
I find that when Heart of the Swamp is going. Not just available is when Strangler Blooms are available. There’s only 5, in the river next to Dyer Chemical. 
---
And I say when it’s running because there have been a couple times I went for the plants, and they weren’t blooming. And I noticed that no one was doing the event. But it also could just bug sometimes.
---
Go, kill the Gulpers and possible ghouls. Harvest with green thumb on. Make with chemist and super duper on, get 20 radshield or more when done.
---
I’ve done this many many times when Heart comes up, I’ve had up to 180 radshields, so I always put some up for sale in my vending and it never fails to sell.
---
It's better than the 200 we started with, but really needs a boost!
---
Getting to know, identify and avoid all the bugs in the game.
---
Nope, they can keep their fucking Spiders. In seriously, it would be cool if they introduced them at a later time, but how would they explained that Spiders can be found here and not anywhere else in the Fallout Universe. Spiders are a common thing.
---
have you looked at your character with that thing on?
---
I am surprised you don't get herpes from it. Literally looks like a dirty panty on your face.
---
they should really fix this because it is a game breaking glitch that locks behind a LOT of quests for lvling up, better weapons, etc and this is sad knowing that this post was made 10 days ago and it's still not fixed
---
the first one is free, that's how it works
---
Already working on that😂
---
Nooooooo that's bloody awful
---
My 3 x TSE Handmade liked  it
---
actually, it seems like the perk cards might actual be broken with the change, along with lots of other things like unarmed melee ect. lots of fuckery with this update. expect 2-3 passes with changes, or a straight revert. this isnt going over well for anyone really.
---
The creator of this post obviously doesn’t have legacy’s
---
The PTS is to test things. Not give you a sneak peek. Hopefully you reported these there.
---
This lucky mucker... Ain't!
---
It's a known bug and should be getting fixed really soon. Should be releasing a hotfix
---
I don't even bother with rep dailies at this point. I'll be taking a *long* break after I've completed TLR, so don't have any inclination to get rep if I won't be making use of it anytime soon, if ever.
---
Why? Just pile them up, set them on fire, and watch them burn! No need to waste caps.
---
Have chems and boost been nerfed to? If that's the case it's not good at all.
---
Whenever I see a teammate using the 'come here' emote, I immediately fast travel to them.
---
I also send messages to teammates when I find a bobblehead, etc.
---
There’s more than 5. I’ve got 8 at one point (16 blooms, 32 Radshield)
---
But, it’s rare that more than 4 will bloom
---
The way I worked out my damage additive instead of multiplicative has my Junkie's build dropping to only 81% of my previous multiplicative damage. That's bad but not as bad as I thought it could be.
---
Got my son the PS4 VR headset for Christmas and one of the games is a first person shooter and has spiders attack in the first part of it.  He screamed. Ripped off the headset and flat out refuses to play that game. 😂
---
When you see / hear a player has good line on the Queen and is unloading a .50 cal, minigun, gatling etc at her...don't run across/ in and out of their line of sight trying to melee a mirelurk hatchling in the grass.
---
Charred ghouls were all Olympian sprinters once.
---
Mirelurk Kings are not friendly or prone to petting.
---
Could be worse guys, just saw on another post that legacy plasmas and Flamers are broken in a bad way as they arent benefitting from any perks anymore so you are snookered if you spent time getting one (yes I'm salty my be flamer is going to be useless now gonna enjoy it for the next few days before forwvwrnin my stash box :(
---
It’s not a bloodied nerf it’s a damage buff nerf
---
My dream weapon is the V/E Laser Rifle.
---
Throw a beam splitter on and you're doing some good damage and heals for days.
---
So it affects bloodied and junkies right ? It’s even worse than I thought
---
Yeah it’s not really better. I came up with my own work around till they change it for better.
---
I take all the ammo I want to convert. Any I don’t I put in my stash.
---
I take a pic with my phone.
---
I go to the AC, and start at the top and work my way down. 
---
Say your concerting shotgun shells. Once you select an amount to convert, hit back. It’ll go back to your amount choice. If you have enough select the amount again. If you don’t and can go down do so.
---
You’ll know you’ve converted as much as you can when you don’t get the message of ammo being removed.
---
Then move on to another kind.
---
On PS4, to leave completely, press and hold the circle.  Which works for any terminal by the way. 
---
It made using it less of a chore. 
---
But can still be way better.
---
But... What about camp budget 😭
---
Agreed vamp lever was bad, vamp 50 cal is just shy of immortality
---
yes all games are buggy and suffer from Duppers and all the stuff you see here. If you only visit this reddit then its going to feel it only happens to Fallout 76, but no its everywhere almost every community suffers from this. Animal Crossing Time travelers, duppers. Call of duty cheaters, Fall Guys is suffering from cheaters as well and that came out last week. Just try to avoid the topics and try to ignore the bad, makes life and gaming so much better.
---
Buy the mutation serum recipes again and sell them in your vending machines for a loss.
---
Looks like my not build build of just using fun guns i like and not really stacking bonuses cuz im too lazy for that and the game isnt so hard that its necessary isn't looking so dumb
---
Even worse it also hits damage perk cards and chems 
---
But the worse of all is the melee
---
i am new to fallout 76 so what is a pts
---
Yup they need to have an inkling of balance to produce new types of content. They were balancing things around broken builds where you one shot everything. This fixes that. Maybe some numbers need tweeking ,but we shouldn't go back to 1k+ dmg on gauss rifles.
---
Junkies is weird, right now as soon as you equip the weapon it will add 50% multiplicative across the board damage (even grenades seem to get the 50% boost as the only other weapon you can equip whilst equipping a Junkie's weapon). I think that's why they call it a magic effect because it's like a self enchantment or something while equipped. So my 236 currently turns into 354 if I equip my Junkie's weapon so I don't think each separate addiction right now work's multiplicatively anyway but additive upto a 50% boost.
---
What did they do to melee ? I literally just started a bloodied melee build
---
But that’s not how you make things harder 
---
This is just gonna make the game slower
---
Why, exactly, do people need to calm down?
---
If they don't like it, they should say so, loudly, before Bethesda actually implements it because, at that point, it's too late.
---
Note: obviously though, since the change affects all builds and all weapons to one degree or another, referring to it as a "bloodied nerf" is inaccurate and should be avoided.
---
I want content as well. Challenge? For Bethesda challenge means bulletsponges and enemies that can see though stealth and freeze you... They made vault raids over again and thats great for the 3% that can do them but for me its awful :D
---
I’ve always only ever gotten 5 blooms. Do you think maybe a few times it might have been verdant season? I’ve had that once and got more. 
---
Data mining sites show only 5 blooms possible.
---
Perhaps I’m missing something, but the way numbers work, whether you, for instance, add five to everything else, or subtract five from the other, either way, the change is the same. So if you buff everyone else, or nerf bloodied, the result is the same which is
---
a narrower distribution of damage across the builds.
---
Make the whitespring great again! I miss the real legendary run.
---
Agreed. In the forest. Not outside it.
---
Because feelings get hurt when people hear viewpoints that conflict with their own.

Took me a few minutes looking to find it this morning, it's under floor decor, it's quite a dark icon so it's easy to miss.
---
Btw I think your comment is being doing voted because Reddit loathes emotions.
---
We already have a slot machine in the game
---
And allies!
---
BIRD BONES
---
No absolutely not. Having the map level divided was a dumb decision. All players should fight enemies their level
---
The GTAO casino was banned in many places because you could buy $ with real money, so it was actual gambling. You can't buy caps so 76 should be fine
---
How do I know what is the standard format?
---
Not yet but with the current damage nerf going on it seems intended to me. We'll see.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/423746/all-damage-modifiers-were-nerfed-not-just-bloodied-explanation-inside
---
In short you’re gonna do lees than 400 damage bloodied and +30strength
---
I'm feeling the exact same way; the grind isn't fun anymore and the amount of bugs just adds to the feeling of being disheartened.
---
A few ideas comes to mind,  let's say super mutants:
---
They can carry heavy guns more often, like miniguns, 50 cals or gatling guns , make them throw floater grenades and have more floaters inside West Tek . Super mutant hounds are dogs and dogs have great tracking skills, so increase their perception to allow better detection of their environment 
---
Assultrons and Gutsys are already fun to fight.  Even in power armor, those auto ballistic guns hurt and don't get me started with the laser beam of the Assultron. Sentry bots need armor penetration in their attacks  
---
Humans like Blood eagles or anything humanoid in general can start throwing plasma grenades and equip automatic weapons more often  instead standard semi auto .
---
Oh No...
---
For the sake of argument, what possibly would you add?  
---
Also, people will be so desperate for more damage that any damage adding card will become pretty much mandatory. I suspect, given the push toward a meta that always happens, that this will reduce build variance significantly. Meta builds arise because they are better than other options.  Most people won't intentionally choose a weaker build, or use other perks when in their mind, they are already behind where they already were. That's not how humans, in my limited experience, work.
---
Two shot sacrifices accuracy, and being unable to hit small targets!
---
Dont run away from players try to communicate. This community have a lot of nice players
---
I prefer set zones. The main quest should have been such that it lead you to where you needed to go as per your approximate level. (It is to a point that I suppose.) The bugs this alone will lead to...
---
You see, aaaaa that’s why we need to panic aaaa
---
So this mean that they are trying to comunicate with the old BoS that now are all death?
---
Reports from the PTS, magic effect still works.
---
Ima head outb
---
Making damage buffs not stack multiplicatively is a good idea for overall balance, but (based on the previous patches) I would not be surprised if One Wasteland and related balance changes were pushed back, possibly even to 2021, in response to the complaining.
---
Public test server, it's runs the next patch of the game for bug fix and fine tuning purposes.
---
Their approval is finicky though.
---
Best to avoid their gaze alltogether really.
---
Level locking parts of the base map should never have been a thing. I should not be forced to stay in one area, and not explore or see all the cool areas and enemies because I'm not high enough level. Its a stupid practice.
---
Just did the daily ops in the Galleria, guess what, being in a darkened room with 4 invisible Colonel Gutsys tearing you a new arsehole isn't fun or challenging Bethesda :-(
---
My fighting platform works just fine 80% of the time the other 20% we cut her out of the sky, adapt to her bs or fail. Tents aren’t the problem, people who get pissy she isn’t dead in 90 seconds and leave are.
---
Wow. Is it official?
---
Not as bad as assaultron aka iron man v2
---
If you get hole-in-one the ball should blow up into a mushroom cloud like the mini nuke
---
Formula P can be stacked.
---
He has been on it every other day for the last few weeks, doesn't reply to any messages asking if he got fire place or any new videos planned question (guess he too famous to answer us low life's)
---
Just wondering if he got a ban for duping and is starting a new character
---
Intended or not, if you aren't reporting things, then you're using the PTS for a sneak peak, instead of what it's meant for. So no real room to complain about bugs in the game if all you do is go and play and but not report or give feedback.
---
Which is a pain in the ass to craft!
---
Or you could run almost straight there and get kicked out level 4-5 whilst picking up a whole armful of skillbooks and stuff on the way. Getting kicked out with your pockets full of caps and buying the MF Hyperbreeder Alpha right away and according to wiki "The MF Hyperbreeder Alpha can fire a total of about 3,995 times from full condition before breaking" as well as having infinite regenerating ammo.
---
I have 1400 hours in NV.... I don’t want to think about how much of that was black jack and save scumming to win at roulette
---
I don't love or hate it. The limit in general is a necessary evil to keep the the game stable, but they also spent the last few games turning us all into a bunch of hoarders, especially with Fallout 4. I would like a little more leeway at maybe 1000,but if it doesn't happen any time soon I probably can't complain as mine is mostly manageable at the moment.
---
Nope the standard MG08 is what i meant, weighs over 100 lbs with a full water jacket but we've already got people walking around with miniguns and gatling guns.
---
That is standard game practice sine the days of yore.
---
She only gives me pipe guns I think she is trying to tell me something 😂
---
Stuff from season 2 look so much better...
---
Just give them Nuka-It's Got My Blood in It. Problem solved.
---
Hopefully Vault 51 will be given a quest line in adventure mode. I want to take ZAX down at some point.
---
I vote minigun, doesnt need gunpowder just lead and steel so ammo isnt too bad to make. The shotgun is a close second, really great gun and ammo friendly but a pain in the rear with scorchbeasts as barely scratches them in the air or you are close to to them, I want to annihilate things within seconds of seeing them not eating for them to get closer or land
---
Looks like they are using the underground camp mechanics to give us underground camps that don’t need a bass or computer to enter , everyone is gonna live in the side of a mountain and spawning at camps will be even more of a nightmare lol
---
I’d be fine if they kept dailies but didn’t have them reset each day. Like have the weekly challenges and then on Tuesday have a set of dailies open up and leave them open all week just stacking each day. This way if you play daily you have the new challenges unlocked and if you want to grind out a longer list every few days or at the end of week you don’t get penalized for not playing every day. I really do hope they do something to change it up because while I’m committed to the grind for this season I know it will not be possible let alone fun to keep going.
---
What games have been that way? Also, not all games had a fucking garbage fire of a launch like 76 did.
---
i guess that is nice, lets people catch up with some of the non-skin rewards if they missed out
---
I'm actually genuinely excited for season 2, I think some of the cosmetics are much better. There's a lot in season 1 I wasn't interested in.
---
Nobody likes being made lesser.  That's just the rub of it.
---
It seems that they might be trying to communicate with one branch of the old BoS, which are all dead.
---
Welp, Modus! ARM THE GIANT DEATH LAZER OF ANNIHILATION FROM SPACE*insert tm here*!
---
Unless you consider everything that does not increase damage outright useless, spending several perk points on &lt;10% extra damage should definitely be less attractive than much higher damage increase for the same points was before. If enemies are damage sponges, that is an issue that would need to be dealt with separately.
---
The patch notes state "piercing sight" is always on on every enemy in the ops. So yeah.
---
That's fine, it would be a shame for people to actually miss out on the ammo converter otherwise.
---
^ this
---
I get the complaints but alot of people don't even know how it was in the first year.
---
And still we learned how to manage it. Right now I'm running around 600-700 of used weight space and that's because I have alot of things in my vendor, otherwise it would be much lower.
---
A fairly advice to all the new players: don't stack too much stuff in the stash, there's no need to.
---
Try to have 20-30 pieces of every material if you have to, or just scrap everything composed by abundant material such aluminum or iron, and keep the rare things only.
---
Don't stack rad x, radaway and stimpacks, you find them basically everywhere and try to use the diluted versions.
---
And pistols build will be unplayable. Awesome.
---
Wait today??!!!! Damn thought I would get at least one more day to enjoy my flamer before it became broke :(
---
Would you consider assistance from... our little enclave? *in a bright and cheery voice* We have a giant death laser from space!
---
Also I think there is one for Season 2 rewards but more like a display case then a mannequin (or vice versa)
---
Huh. Guess I've skipped that. Thank you!
---
Nice reference!
---
Don't be discouraged[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i5ufmh/quakecon_twitch_eventwhat_a_joke/g0rlwna/)  
---
There's plenty ~~of new ones added with every single patch while the old ones are left unfixed in favour of fixing photoframes~~ of content.
---
Mixed feelings. See, personally I like the idea of items having a limited time entry into the game. It creates variety and uniqueness to camps and character appearance. 
---
But adding new items to what can be bought with gold is good.
---
At least you get to respawn, I keep getting the 360 camera swing with my body on the ground for 10-15 then it’s a 50/50 chance of it letting me pick a spot on the map. I’ve lost so many mats due to this lol
---
Forget spiders, no giant snakes?
---
Season 2 will have those. Saving atoms to buy ranks.
---
I get the changes, they're not so terrible. The day where the damage bonus would be additive instead of multiplicative was due for a bit now. We know it was going to happen.
---
Yeah it's not that cool, but even if you run a bloodied build that supposedly can do 29.5 damage and now does 24.5, you're still oneshotting everything.
---
If not, two shots are all you need.
---
Maybe the queen will take a bit longer to kill but I wouldn't bother that much.
---
Also sometimes I'm bored that there's no really a challenge because everything you spav is dead meat. If this gets the combat a bit exciting then why not...
---
That is actually pretty sweet looking
---
Healthcare is fubar because corporations are free to treat every patient as a revenue stream to milk.  The same thing has happened to the prison system, where private prison corporations are motivated to keep inmates in prison to keep the quarterly reports looking respectable, instead of rehabilitating the criminal.  The inmates are treated the same as diary cows or civets.  Special interest bribes have slowly eroded our morals, obfuscating what is truly important.
---
Wow so exciting
---
There is always complaining about any changes in the direction of making the game more difficult. Hopefully the devs will not listen to it, but I do worry they cave in and delay One Wasteland and the balance overhaul to 2021, similarly to how the legendary perks keep getting pushed back.
---
Lol,  you triggered the essential oil using members of the fallout community. Soldier on reddit rebel , just be careful, fighting in an echo chamber will give you tinnitus
---
This makes me wish that the junk jet was in 76, but then how would ammo work? Would all the junk just be dropped when you die? Or would all the junk currently loaded in it stay in it? That would be an interesting scenario, if the later was true then everyone would be carrying it just to carry their junk without a chance for any of it to drop.
---
Not gonna lie, that sounds much more realistic. But I get how it’d be annoying in game.
---
well Power Armor Displays are coming!
---
Or skins we buy that work on legendaries.
---
It would look kinda chunky if it comes with the tripod.
---
Also if this one would be a skin for the MG42, it would have to be held similarly to the MG42 in game.
---
Hmm wasn't it? You might be correct, been quite a while since I fired up that game.
---
Vendors should use their own stash. If you don't use  Fo1st then you'll probably use 700 out of the 800 just for junk, leaving no space for your vendors.
---
Also, the StashBox &amp; ScrapBox from Fallout 1st are outrageous pay2win mechanics. Have your stash everywhere (so no need to carry spare items just in case) and you can just loot everything after an event and insta-scrap it unlike someone else who is limited by weight limit. I tried Fallout 1st for one month and my wealth went up dramatically as well as the amount of vendor sales (because I had more space for actually selling).
---
Imo the best way to deal with this is to have a second machine with an alt account just for selling and storing. Also make a PackRat alt character just for carrying 6000+ LBS in junk (lvl 1 with 3x packrat card + maxed out carry weight afk in base). This is also cheaper than Fo 1st BUT requires a second machine. You can cheese this even further btw.
---
LONG LIVE OUR SENTIENT SUPER INTELLIGENT AI LEADER!
---
Them smoking pipes...
---
I'm pretty sure that when I played I had to download a mod to build there
---
I solved this the day it started broadcasting and almost posted, then discovered some guys had already datamined the game and posted all the solutions to this and all future encrypted broadcasts as well.  Felt like a damn clownface going through all that effort.
---
The internet is great, but we lost something too...
---
Actually it was only banned cause you could buy money on gta, making it too close to irl gambling.
---
Yeah I get it, especially with one wasteland (something I really didn’t want) as what’s the point in levelling up and getting better gear if the enemies scale so I’m only hitting equivalent as hard as a lvl 20 something unless I have miss understood how the scaling will work.
---
Although I agree we would have had nicer results tweaking each weapon individually it’s also something I knew would never happen with the effort and time it would take for the to achieve when they struggle to even provide what the patch notes say as it is.
---
i think they should finish the game before releasing any thing else
---
High level players should always take the time to assist lower level players.... Goes without saying. 👍
---
Would Faster Fire Rate be affected?  Since FFR increases the number of shots, not damage, wouldn’t that have to be a whatever your damage is x 1.25 multiplier?
---
Yeah good addition too. Seen some PVP like suggestions too about the new dead content arena in Watoga, so many possibilities.
---
Why are you crying here, kids? 😂😂😂
---
Bloodthirsty Uncle Todd would take your favorite blood guns? Ahhhh, what a shame and disappointment. Everything is lost. Game should die😭😭😭😭
---
I kill any alive creature including survivors max in 60 sec. Ok, let's say this time should be doubled. Well, so what? Waste some more rounds? Then to hell with it.
---
Where is the interest in playing a game where 95% of living creatures die from the some shots (my special greetings to SBQ. This beast do needs some hundreds ammo🤪) and the remaining 5% (survivors) are afraid of pvp like fire?
---
Im Bloody commando &amp; I do only appreciate such changes in game. It should give a chance other nice builds (Berserker, Mutant) to go alive
---
Im really tired to read endless “...wtb bloody something” on FO76 Market😂
---
PLEASE.  I can't do this shit again.
---
a giant pile would also suffice
---
I understand why they don't have a separate Stash for vendors as people could just sell their items for 30k and hide the vendors behind a locked door just so they can have the extra space.
---
Interesting plot twist there at the end LMAO.  I didn't figure this out until like my tenth level which was so close to the start of the game anyways that I just deleted and started over to make a better character with what I had learned.  At least after 400 something levels you have had enough extra points to fix yours as well lol.
---
There is indeed no way around the fact that low health builds used to deal more than triple damage, in addition to all the other benefits. If enemies are given enough hit points not to be killed too easily by those, then they are damage sponges for everyone else. Changing how the buffs stack shrinks the differences all around, so that a full bloodied build now deals "only" double damage compared to a simple non-legendary weapon at full health, rather than more than triple.
---
It’s because you are on Xbox , my PS4 community is awesome my best friend played with my friends and bought the game for his XBox because he fell in love . He played for three days and hasn’t touched it in months because people on Xbox were complete dbags 24/7 to him
---
I recently ran West Tek during the day with a nocturnal hunting rifle and cleared it one or two shotting everything. Damage levels really do need addressing. According to reports melee has been hit the most which seems reasonable as it reduces the chance of seeing SBQ being smacked into oblvion the second she lands.
---
It's designed to get people to buy FO1.  Simple enough.
---
too low
---
Nice and... Direct. Eh 🤣😅🤣😷😷
---
Gutsys are challenging and I like that. So learn to take a challenge
---
WTF Lunch boxes 100 bullion, that just sucks. Would have been way better for the economy if you could buy them for Caps, We desperately need more Caps sinks.
---
Great, you play with a carbine or a machine gun. You kill everyone for 1 shot. What should I do? I play with pistols, in order to kill a simple super mutant I need to make 2 shots in the head out of stealth! This update will simply destroy my pistol build! How should I play further? Spend 10,000 rounds of ammo fighting the queen and kill her in 20 minutes if you're lucky? You remove the damage - improve the pistols, how much you can already ask, they are now at the very bottom, and Bethesda is in a hurry to bury them.
---
Yea.. That's the thing isn't it. How do you know who is the "New" player or not?
---
That player could have a level 500+ just waiting to come back and rip you to bits 😖😖😖
---
I think there are enough lunchboxes handed out in the legendary run honestly, I wouldn't spend any caps or bullion on them.
---
How is that more realistic? It's the opposite
---
That is definitely a bug.
---
Because what Damage Perks apply is handled by the Weapon not its effects.
---
My captain cosmos dark matter is shiny. The lamp is quite buggy. Sometimes it projects, sometimes it doesn't. Season 2 is a massive step forward though. Everyone has something they want from it.
---
Edit: kinda shiny. Not as good as they advertised.
---
I recently moved 3 camps and I am yet to see that wallpaper bug people are talking about. It always redirect me to the store as intended.
---
Thanks lol it was a real facepalm moment for me, but I also don't think the game makes it very clear (e.g., only displaying certain cards).  Maybe I just missed some instruction early on.
---
Turning enemies into bullet sponges doesn’t mean making enemies harder get that through your thick fucking skull
---
Well as your base damage is nowhere near the same as a handmade coupled with the fact it’s the perks and mutations that have nerfed in the way the react it’s not going to make a massive amount of difference to a build like pistols.
---
Quality review.
---
&gt; Having a anti-USA slogan printed on every armor is like printing a 'Communism sucks' slogan on every Enclave armor. It is lazy stereotype and it looks bad. 
---
You probably have missed the whole point of Fallout universe.
---
i.e. It is an exaggeration of all bad aspects of US culture and Capitalism, including Red Scare. Fallout 76 continues this from day 1 EXTREMELY well (both lore, and atom shop wise xD)
---
As long as you rush the objectives it’s possible but it’s impossible solo from what I seen in this daily op to get elder tier. The objectives require you to stand and guard points and the more players around the point it adds additional multipliers to the speed to said objective  as long as players are around it.
---
Thus speeding up the mission. Paladin tier is possible solo if you rush.
---
They added a new public group that is specifically for daily op. Hopefully that will allow solo players to get elder tier as long as you have competent teammates.
---
I’m ok with it , seems fair we got them for free why not let people who didn’t have an option to buy
---
And are u claiming u can solo the queen with a pistol build currently with less than 10k rounds or even achieve it?  Please share that build
---
Yes still the same.  They also have discounts in atom shop exclusive to fallout 1st. But Idk if that was there from the beginning or not
---
Also there is some glitches/exploits with the survival tent in certain events. Line in the sand is a much better event now for xp.
---
This game, potentially, could go on for years. Just wait til the £££ DLC arrives with offers of special weapons/armour etc.
---
It's been very cheap to date and, I think good value too.
---
the S2 reward seems to be a power armor station, but it would be cool if it was a display stand. I kinda like the one from the ATX images, its just the mannequin style, just plot the power armor down.
---
I always do.
---
It's in atom shop now?
---
Because some people traded their firstborn for a weapon that will soon be meh?
---
That +50% limb damage is a magic effect which will melt the SBQ btw
---
Good for you 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
---
I think they might have. The past few days I've not gotten it to work either. Odd
---
I started to put my vending machines in the Seedy Shack/Shed so that I could lock them up when stuff like this happened (or when I hit cap limit), but then I realized they could still be accessed via the windows.   So I built an addition to the house....without windows.   It took me awhile because I'm just horrible at electricity.   Now I'm glad I did it.   All I have to do is turn off the electricity so many fewer people will even see my camp and lock the door.   True, someone still may glitch one way or another, but hoping this takes care of 90 percent of players.
---
It's extremely disappointing that we have to deal with this AGAIN.   And that so many people are a$$holes that make it necessary.   We've had to deal with two heartbreaking felony thefts in real life recently, and I don't find this stuff amusing at all.
---
The way I feel with the pts nerfs all I can say is enjoy your new weapons.
---
Sounds about right smh
---
I agree that caps would have been better...but, I’m just happy they aren’t on the atom shop and can be bought with an in game currency
---
But nothing like that. Damage is cut as a percentage. By about 60%. Now my 10mm does 200 damage per shot, which means it will be 140. Instead of 2 shots, it will take at least 3-4 to destroy the enemy. Instead of 15 minutes of the battle with the queen, it will take 23-25, which automatically means that the pistol is no longer capable of destroying the SBQ alone, unlike carbines and machine guns. You can kill her with a carbine in 5-8 minutes, with a machine gun in about the same. Pistol? And why do we need a pistol, let everyone play with carbines and machine guns, who generally needs variety
---
Good sportsman ship. I battled a legacy laser with a chinese stealth suit and dcg the other day and I swear he was getting really mad because he couldn’t see me coming. Good times in pvp against legacy players.
---
Yeah that is a shame in a way! I was glad to find out in another comment that there were more broadcasts and there was more to it than what I had found, but at the same time, it does seem like wasted effort. 
---
All I can say is, I had fun doing it by hand and I don’t regret doing so even after finding out that people beat me to it so long ago
---
Yeah, so it won't be that hard.
---
Hahahahahaha a lmao to that comment.
---
Sorry BTW. Couldn't help myself. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😅😅😅😷😖👍
---
Yeah, I also carry a tesla so good luck, haha, legacies in PvP but as soon as stealth boys are out tesla come out aswell, good job though
---
I hope that BOS bunker in season 2 is available to buy later.
---
Well I'm maxed out on all my characters,  Caps have no value, and been reminded that I'm maxed out every other second really starts to get  annoying.
---
Just use the firework glitch for much faster reload 😎
---
Even makes double barrel shotguns much more fun too.
---
See, I could get behind this. I could get personally invested and understand the need right away, like I could sympathize. But there should also be an option to light them on fire and throw it in too.
---
Actual question here but I’ve been hearing a lot of people saying that most MMO/RPGs use additive % and only some of the weaker ones use multiplicative. I think Borderlands 3 uses both but most are additive.
---
Don't worry, Todd will put a cap on it of like 500 caps you can win in total.
---
You know what, I hate to be so anti-fun but they won't have seen it happen. Physics interactions are calculated client-side in fo76, so your exact position on your screen being subtly different to the server and hence their screen, means that any physics interaction such as pushing a ball will ultimately end up with it playing out significantly differently to every other player.
---
#**GWENT**
---
Actually it is still banned in several countries who have gambling laws. Only difference in RDR2 is that it isn't using purchasable in-game money.
---
Why do they show as not learned- have you not unlocked on the playing board? Also you said once the run is completed; will these appear once the season is over, regardless of run completion?
---
Misspelling of deteriorate. They are saying the weapon condition gets worse much faster than other weapon types causing repairs to be needed more frequently.
---
I have bloodied ffr tesla as back up too. I usually don’t pull it out until the other guy. I like to fight as underdog. Getting stabbed in the back I’m sure sucks.  If they still had it to where you can one shot people I would still exclusively use dcg and stealth.
---
Honestly surprised ,I always thought it would be pretty toxic
---
Lasers work with respective perks, well commando do, demo expert still doesn't work and I haven't tested bobbleheads
---
Honestly, just so it’s a more round number, I’d like it to be 1000.
---
Are we due another upgrade? Eh. I’ve been around since the start, so I know what it means to have no space, but I also know exactly what’s going to happen to that space if it gets added - within a few days, I’ll have it filled with junk.
---
As for when I bump the cap, I just drop a rather useless junk item off at a robot vendor.
---
U run low health and adrenal reaction with pistols. And from what I’ve read it’s nowhere near 60%. It’s also on pts servers and is being tested. Just like the legendary perks which have changed and been tweaked. I shouldn’t worry about it until it actually happens. And even then I wouldn’t believe what u read on here. Earlier I saw a guy claim his 2000 head shot fixer was now dojng only 180 on normal servers and it’s ruined the game.
---
Racing radrats.
---
A lot of this is down to the lack of usage of microphones to interact.
---
The emotes are awkward and so is trading with individual players.
---
Just how I see it.
---
Noice, finally some resemblance of a ghost of a balance.
---
Though I expected Bloodied to be fix in a way that health % was calculated from available max health (including decrease from radiation) rather than max health without deductions (i.e. radiation).
---
Yeah, I used to always use my tesla which I found boring as even if they quantum spammed my q50ld tesla just cripples them and I can circle them but I don't waste my ammo on them
---
Yeah, legally speaking if the game allows you to gamble with purchasable in-game money that's a big hell no. But, if the currency used for gambling isn't purchasable with real money, then you are getting there. GTAO technically does this as you must convert cash into chips in order to gamble. In RDO, you can't buy into poker games with gold so there isn't an issue. I mean yeah some countries still ban gambling nonetheless.
---
Just use the Chinese Stealth armour.. Its a breeze.. Plus a few plasma grenades of course 😎😎😎👍👍
---
Given how few people use those perks already, I think people place a much higher value on the utility of killing things than the utility provided by being able to carry more of some specific things. Would people just keep super-duper or scrapper on all the time?  A lot of people have F01, so you can bring your tent to you nearly anywhere - why waste time on weight mitigation, or food spoilage perks?  
---
There are so few perk slots, relatively speaking, that efficiency pushes us toward damage. That's why bloodied has been so transcendent in terms of usage. These are not the sort of changes that make things more fun. Like most of the other changes recently (hello double wall exploit fix?), they're not what the community asked for; they're change seemingly for the sake of change.

Build in the end of video
---
Anyway, I kills SBQ in 11-12 min. When update is coming, I will need at least 16-19 mins to kill it WITHOUT deaths. Event time - only 25 mins, so, if you die - the event  will be not finished. Pistols will be absolutely trash (it's trash now, when update will release - nobody will play em)
---
We do have a foos-ball table (or table soccer/football to some of you) along with a shooting gallery coming in. They're just interactive and play out the animation, but it would be nice to get a playable game.
---
Your claiming over a 50% damage reduction?
---
20 Str. Means you’re getting a good deal of damage output. But if it’s not multiplicative anymore, then that’s gonna hurt you the same way not going Bloodied is.
---
PvP animal friends battles!
---
Awesome. I’ll watch the video now. Didn’t know u could get that much damage from a pistol build.
---
Edit I just saw it’s at the end of the video. All good
---
And really, once you have your gear, there isn't much else to do with the bullion.  I cleaned out the raiders and settlers and am working on the USSS list for lulz. (But I've made a nice sent in their list)
---
It'll be nice to keep the lunchbox love flowing 🤘
---
Is that Angry Turtle "Magic" effect gone then??
---
This is awesome.  It seems like a big f/u to all those who bitch that Beth doesn't listen.
---
How far are you with the Raiders? I ask because if you can land yourself the ammo machine it helps. From there as for stims, either make them with tick-blood and blood packs, or go stealth and pop the heads off mothman cultists, for some reason those guys lug around so many of them. I mean I get it, they are human NPCs after all, but one guy had about 5 stims on him!
---
I watched what the rewards were, played enough to get the ammo machine and went playing The Division 2 while waiting for One Appalachia.
---
Why not both?
---
nice, this is cool
---
Yeah, it took me a long ass time to get my armor and weapons for a bloodied build. And a hell of a lot of caps. Plus the amount of hours and ginding to change around my perk setup.
---
Im finding this game tedious as it is. If its now going to be more boring and tedious doing farm routes etc i just wont play any longer.
---
Yeah no, it really should have been nerfed.
---
Take a damage produced by lvl5, 55, 105 and see the difference, now scale 55 and 105 with bloodied, this is just like US wealth distribution today.
---
Not even taking into account bonuses that unyelding set provides (max condition legendary loot, max durability loot, max stealth bonus, max carry weight, max experience from intelligence, max shop discounts) and exchange it with power armour bonuses (40% damage reduction, flat radiation resistance, can't sit on chairs)
---
Would u mind posting up your build. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks. I’m now very intrested in making a pistol build on an alt
---
I just played on the PTS, being full health not Bloodied or Junkies I am ok with the damage changes, I hardly noticed.
---
What wasn't good was the Galleria Daily challenge thing.
---
As if Colonel Gutsys arent bad enough, they are totally invisible and it is quite dark in there, so you end up with 4 or 5 of them tearing you a new arsehole, and as soon as you kill one another spawns in right in front of you, it's virtually impossible lol :-)
---
Good job killing that level 19 player

You thought the rewards were useless before? haha.

I cant donate much stuff to bos without fo1st, game is literally Inventory simulator, fuck that crap
---
Way back in the dark ages I didnt realize you had to equip perks, I thought you just got them automatically when you opened a pack. I think I got to level 12 or so before I figured that one out.
---
Finaly now game would be harder and more enjoyable at least for me and my game friends who playing from the start wihtout any diference in combat gameplay
---
Actually...imagine that entire Top of the World interior place being emptied out by some construction robots and retrofitted into a casino with each one of the old shop stalls being turned into another gambling hall, bar, etc. Could even have the floor design changed to mirror a roulette wheel. She could then have us help her acquire some "muscle" to act as security. Hijack some Sentry Bots as bouncers and give them a bit of personality like her. Then find some Mr. Handy's to work as dealers and bar tenders. I could see her saying something about how this is far more lucrative than just waltzing up with a gun and demanding someone's caps. Instead they come to her and just hand them over! Could even have her make references to the old Vegas strip and mention wondering if it survived the nukes.
---
Used to have my camp there with cave entrance tucked behind Nuka machine door. Had my brewing station setup down in the cave.
---
I mean yeah I am sure if it is 1000 I will just be upset again later on, however I think the players deserve an upgrade for sticking around this long.
---
Gaaaaa....
---
Thanks. Makes me wonder how some people can still post using T6 and not the built-in spellcheck.
---
Yes. This is what a live service game needs. A casino. Like lootboxes. That sounds nice.
---
Yeah it's just shiny black paint, but not the silvery black that was advertised in the picture. That picture makes it look like the red rocket paint, which is reflective and glistening. Just a real letdown that the final rewards are so underwhelmingly done.
---
People *are* (to my understanding) overblowing the damage to bloodied. 
---
Most are upset b/c the items the worked for a long ass time to get and are worth way to much thanks to the state of the games economy are less valuable/useful.
---
I’m still really not looking forward to it on melee. I don’t care about one shotting, but depending on how much my damage drops, I’m going to frustrated if my build gets hit that hard.
---
You can mod plasma Gatling to be flamer, so it makes sense
---
start saving up those Mr. Fuzzy tokens at camden amusement park!
---
My XO1 looks badass with the arms and legs from the dark matter paint and regular xo1 silver head and chest , I know it’s a silly thing but I love it
---
I am being sarcastic only,i am fine with the changes just every other post is about how they need 1 or 2 more bullets to kill something on the pts :) oh i can imagine the gutsys in there lol
---
I was also disappointed. I only wanted the t65 paint and the wallpapers. Other than that I wasn't too bothered
---
This is fine, honestly. At people can still get these.
---
I disagree on the lunchboxes, though. I don’t see why those need to be able to be bought. They could’ve stayed in the seasons where they belonged.
---
Well they nerfed it, specifically to make sure that bosses aren't a bullet sponges for everyone just to be balanced with OP build.
---
Though I agree on the way nerf itself was done is not right, they should have instead changed formula to take adjusted maximum health instead of possible max health (under current stats)
---
I thought like it too when i was first started the game always running from players. But then some high level players emoted like gifts or follow emote, showed inyeresting places and hunted with them. they also gave a lot gifts. But there is a few toxic player too so i offer u to not carry around ur valuable junk items. Use ur stash box for it.
---
Member, we do not talk about the approval process.
---
The damage stacking was completely out of control, the way it was calculated really tied their hands when it came to introducing anything new because it would add more over the top to existing over the top.  We may not like the combat change but it was 100% necessary and for once they attacked the correct problem, stacking, rather than nerfing bloodied into the complete irrelevance.  I think the changes will need some getting used to but its for the better.    -- a bloodied player
---
Not claiming anything just making fun of it tbh,cause every other post since pts went live is about dmg being to much nerfed! :)
---
New community project to acquire concrete, steel, wood, etc to rebuild the dam?
---
Actually what if we did a community project for the Whitespring resort to get it reopened. With the inflow of guests and the limitation caused by the ghoul guests at the golf club, we could propose to the head to turn the old dance hall into a small casino. Maybe even get the movie theater up and running playing the movies we see advertised throughout the fallout games.
---
Sweet, But will that swap over on the live servers?
---
I personally love the idea I might be able to farm anywhere on the map I enjoy for exp.
---
Now imagine even worse bullet sponges when bosses are balanced for OP builds, and then not everyone is using that OP build
---
I know you were being funny :-)
---
You can also get some season 1 rewards so most likely it's staying.
---

---
Oh your post reads as though your on the pts server and your now having to use two shots instead of 1 to get your damage the same
---
Japan is the paradise of soft drinks. But Fanta Melon will always be my favorite ever.
---
Sadly no, just some overall settings.
---
My work around is a programmable mouse with a setting for sniping and normal play each.
---
Oh don't worry, already taught Grahm a thing or two at my old clinic. Today's botched surgical patient, tomorrow's iguana bits!
---
Again? When were they actually nerfed last time and how?
---
24bit/48000Hz seems to be the standard, but in some cases like in the post I linked above with wireless headsets it can be different (depends on the soundcard, if it can handle the bitrate - guess the wireless connection of thoose could not). 
---
There is no harm to switch it to for example to 16bit/44100Hz (CD quality) and see if it works, you can always undo the change. If you don't have the absolute hearing abilities of a trained musician, you won't notice a difference anyway :-)
---
That's not purified water, it's irradiated toxic sludge

---
Well what can I say but we will meet again in Washington
---
What you talking about? I can fit 4 per titles, one on each corner
---
Edit: well corn at least that all I keep on my base
---
Bruh why would they even nerf anything. The game is good, what they should adjust they don't and what they shouldn't touch they destroy.
---
Nerfing everything means one thing, value of weapons will go down and legacies will become even more expensive. With these new gauss weapons it was pretty much a tie with legacies, but if this nerf goes into the final game then you might just scrip your stuff.
---
Back at launch they nerfed shotguns, now they're pretty much useless. I guess it was just a matter of time before they nerf everything. Why not just go around with non legendary weapons, they might eventually deal more damage than legendaries.
---
What's their reason anyway to nerf every build, what's the point of builds if all you get is penalties and nothing good in return. Where is their brain?
---
Nope, just did the event few minutes ago where someone had glitched it. Still working.
---
Season 2 will make me grind again. So many good things.
---
Looks pretty cool
---
Buy plans, power armor mods, mutation serum recipes!
---
Complain to the manager?
---
(Sorry, I had to because of the name)
---
Yeah the gauss shotty. But gauss minigun is gonna become useless
---
She likes you, she's hinting that she wants you to, you know, give her *your* pipe weapon.
---
is that achievable with a razer one? how you do it, like just in fo76 when you right click it changes dpi?
---
I haven't seen anything about S2 yet, afraid to look and get my hopes up.
---
I have done the SBQ hundreds of times, ive never seen it insta killed. I doubt if a bloodied build is insta killing it. It normally dies in a few minutes sure, but id rather that then be hanging around for 20 minutes while it aimlessly flies about. The event isn't engaging enough and rewards aren't worth enough to warrant twiddling your thumbs for 20 minutes.
---
And i can insta kill a Sheepsquatch sure. With a magic weapon...
---
No I don't think so. It came in a bundle.
---
Good idea with the pic lol
---
I have a lot of ammo I just wanna convert but then I noticed I have to keep pressing O multiple times to backtrack all the time I converted to exit the damn thing
---
I won't be using it anytime soon
---
Still working a few hours ago.
---
Nah sorry if i misslead you,its just to many people are unhappy about it and i dont see the reason,comming from a guy who is playing since beta,and running bloodied build since the era of dinosaurs.I like the changes on the pts tbh
---
Praise Fuzzy
---
I received "The Gutter" plan from one run. The same  assaultron blade you get as a quest reward that has a vampiric effect and extra damage build in. I didn't have modules to craft/test but it requires 2 legendary modules to craft so i would imagine it gets random legendary effects when crafted on top of those already build in.
---
Other run gave a me some camp item signs plan, a burrows something something i think.
---
By the time I was level 20, I was one shotting Savage Deathclaws with the Deliverer from Sneak because it is just that much more powerful than other pistols. In 76, I was one tapping a Deathclaw from behind at level 16, because Deathclaws are way too weak in this game. And Behemoths are too rare in 76. In over a thousand hours, I only came across one. *One.* But the endgame is tuning your build so you *can* one shot the Queen, or you *can* one tap the Imposter Sheepsquatch. My melee character could put out 8k damage a hit, but his build wasn’t finished yet. I reckon I could have had it up to 30k+ given the right buffs. But that’s the entire point! I’m not done until I can one tap that SBQ.
---
I think you missed the point that damage buffs now make relatively less difference. That is simple mathematics, less benefit for the same investment. For a full health player with a basic non-legendary weapon, there is like 10% loss in damage, while for a full bloodied build, it is almost halved. If this is not enough to affect decisions in practice, that just means even more changes would be needed. I also get it that those with the "meta" builds are upset, but it is not always a good idea to only listen to what the community asks for, especially when it comes to balance, since people usually just want the game to be made easier/more rewarding for themselves.
---
Interesting that lunch boxes can be bought with bullion
---
I'd actually love to use golf-clubs like a ranged weapon with that. Maybe also let us play baseball, albeit there are not baseball fields...
---
Tbh I dont mind the ammo convertor being sold. Lunch boxes are a nice edition too. Would be better if we had a receipe to Craft them tho.
---
They were bullet sponges for non bloodied builds, now they are even more so because THEY NERFED EVERYTHING!
---
Armor and power armor displays, BoS bunkers. Wow.
---
It's a marked location, but not a settlement you can own (without mods.)
---
It was datamined a long time ago and it seemed to have an atomic shop tag in the code. Maybe it was a different variant.
---
Guided Meditation, too.
---
Can you blame him? The Wendigo is just trying to get his daily treasury notes for that T-65.
---
I kind of feel what you're saying because most of these rewards do look very good, but if there isn't enough new content for me (especially story related content) I think I'll still take a big break (if not outright quit) until there is more storyline to pursue.
---
Grinding for bullion and score every day isn't my idea of fun anymore.  I'll probably just finish off this first season "just because" and see how things go.  Definitely leaning towards quitting though.
---
I have only so many hours in a day, and I want to play other games.
---
Welp, that's going to be the main feature of my nightmares going forward.
---
They scale to your level, but it stops scaling at certain point. I'm level 690, and the highest level I've seen so far was a level 100 super mutant. As far as I can tell, that's their max.
---
It feels very inconsistent tho. In the same group of enemies, one can be a level 100, another a level 75 and another a level 50, so not every of them scale to their max level. No idea if it is a bug or if it is intended to work like that.
---
Also, some regions seem to be bugged atm. The Forest and the Ash Heap aren't scaling to the max level, only to level 25.
---
And I think is the same for low level characters, enemies have a minimum level. I haven't tried it myself because I only have that level 690 character, so no idea how it's working.
---
They used the example of a megasloth. The minimum level of a megasloth is 20, so any megasloth you find while you are under level 20, for you it will always be a level 20 megasloth until you reach that level, and then it will start scaling along with your level (or that's what I understood).
---
I know this game is a exaggeration of capitalism and red scare, and this is the reason why I love this game. But i am just thinking aesthetically more thought could be put into designing a stereotype communist Chinese soldier. The text 美帝必敗 literally means 'The USA will fall', which is, imo, a pretty lame slogan. I think having a big red star is alright already.
---
Seeing the slogan on the collectrons and the armors remind me of watching p0rn one night and saw some weird Chinese text tattooed on the back of the actress, something about lemonade, I guess she just google-translate the 'when life gives you lemon' idiom. It is so distracting and I am like, wtf... ??
---
Sure it’s better to lower the damage of op weapons/builds. Giving enemy’s more hp/resistance would fuck up the game for player who don’t have this op shit. A good build and a good legendary weapon should be the cherry on top and not turn every enemy into a trashmob.
---
Genuine question but do you mean buffed to just blooded or buffed to fully kitted max bloodied? I ask because isn’t the latter basically a 1-2 shot build?
---
razorgrain flour has same ap boost and weight as sugar and you can grow it in your camp EDIT i forgot it uses concrete too
---
Im a bloodied build. Not completely efficient for damage output, because of a necessity for other perks too. But fairly efficient. The only weapon I have that one shots enemies is my bloody plasma caster. And thats just mobs. (unless adrenaline has kicked in) I see no reason why if you have a powerful weapon and you spent hours grinding to perfect your loadout, you shouldn't be able to one shot mobs. 
---
I agree about enemies like the Behemoth etc. But deathclaws are garbage in this game anyway, just like in Fallout 4.
---
So, any buffs to explosive weapons? Like the laughably bad Fatman? Nah didnt think so.
---
Holy fuck season 2 looks incredible. Commie Cobra Commander is something I couldn’t have predicted but I adore. So many rad as hell items. LOVE it.
---
As with all things on pts it’s a change that may well not not look anything like it does when it actually goes live. If it’s even implemented. I agree some of the comments are ridiculous
---
Like someone said above, it'll still be banned. I play RDO and a lot of people in other countries were bummed when they released poker because even though you can't buy in using real life money, it's still considered online gambling.
---
I am using a razer Kone, it has 2 dpi switches on top. I just went and gave the software only 2 possibilities to switch between .)
---
Demo Expert didnt work on legacies for ages even thou they are explosive.
---
I totally agree with you ;)
---
Definite need.
---
For small price of not having budged for any decent quality of life perk cards, with legendary I perks I theoretically can take 5 of the strengths, and increase my charisma from 3 to 8 and have shitload of QoL cards in there, or a bit more in luck, and so on and on
---
phew, i really wanted the chicken coop so it’ll be nice knowing i don’t have to grind to 78 now
---
I agree. Finally starting to be able to shop for armor in the wake of all those damn Fasnacht masks.. but that wasn't all that came from that event.
---
Camp plans  
---
Weapon/armor/mod plans  
---
Recipes.
---
Maybe even equipped items moved to their own tab, and not visible to be scrapped or sold.
---
Interesting. I’m fine with that. As long as it’s not atoms.
---
Honestly all the theories are just that ,theories.
---
Reality is that each and everytime you find them ,is because someone on the server is at that point of the quest.
---
I have my mule right at that step of the quest and can spawn them in any server anytime.
---
No, you didn't miss anything.  It's not clear at all.
---
The Queen dies that fast due to a glitch, not due to bloodied builds!
---
Once I figured all that out, it was actually ok to use. I got rid of a lot of ammo. And I will just keep adding till I get close to the 100,000 limit. Then I'll start pulling ammo from there. It's like a stash free ammo machine once you fill it up.
---
Whenever the opportunity presents, strike at the profligates. Pile body upon body.
---
Firstly they are coming across the US, past mountain ranges along destroyed road ways. They'd likely only have what they can carry or what they could fit on a commandeered pack brahmin or the back of a suit of power armor. Plus they've been marching for about 6 months if I recall. As for what purpose, there was a screen-grab showing the built fortifications of the base. Steel plating on the dome, on the walls, walls seemed to be mostly metal based with some wooden platforms. etc. Also the Brotherhood wasn't always the same brotherhood. It changed over the years. The first Brotherhood of the west coast was sincere in their intentions. Tagardy's Thunder were also okay for the most part, although they did butt heads with the Firebreathers and Responders on how to deal with the Scorched and took a more direct approach which ultimately lead to their downfall.
---
Thats really good tbh,now people can spend gold bullion if they have everything what they need from faction vendors!
---
&gt; Those season pass outfits look clean af
---
Bit bummed we don’t have the blue one seen on the board and a few reward previews...

1 - Where did I complain
---
2 - Where did I say I do not report it
---
3 - This is some kind of report as well

All the irradiated spiders went in vacation to Australia

Yea that how I see it too

It just an ammo vendor you can buy and sell ammo too with special currency...  It annoying to use for us because we are high lvl with 1000s of ammo but for newbie player it is perfect
---
Dude, that is the bloody best ideea, I have my 2nd level 53 character and I will not complete the quest with this character, jump into my pvt and bham, thanks man, will try
---
I think the risk reward has been taking away they removed the life giver regen glitch that helped us stay alive and now they damage has been reduced. So more hits to kill multiple enemies will result in more deaths. I've no problem with the changes but make them fair instead of damage reductions the other weapons need buffing. I know I can't really talk I never experienced what AA and TS were like before the nerf before when they were two bullet not 1.25 bullet for example. But I think buffing other weapons and rebalancing all weapons. Then see how one wasteland goes before debuffing damage
---
I have an alt for alternate weapons and playstyles.  I also had 2 months of 1st to build a giant stash of scrap in my junkbox.  That said, it's amazing how fast newer components use up the weight limit in my regular stash now that I can't just throw in my scrapbox.
---
I've given up on everything but big guns on my main, and put my best weapons in the vending machine.
---
It's still not enough, I'm going to empty out most of my outfits (especially armors) soon, and will have to sort through and throw away or bulk up and sell the low priority scrap in my stash.
---
Honestly, since I don't really feel like paying for Fallout 1st again, this'll probably be the straw that breaks the camel's back.  Once this season's over and I have all the score rewards, I'll likely take a long break or outright quit.
---
I finished all the story content for both sides (made an alt to do the Raider vault raid) so unless they add a bunch more, I don't really have anything left to do but grind, and that's not why I play Fallout.
---
Not really upset by those. After all, the chicken coops fits the settlers and I know people would want it for its compact nature compared to the Brahmin pen. On top of that the ammo converter has such a built system it wouldn't make sense to isolate those who joined post-season 1.
---
Dang it , Bye bye my beautiful Mansion, hello military camp.
---
Key ring
---
That's actually not a bad thought as I sell plans in the vendor showing its not a stack of mounted heads would probably attract more visitors.
---
They are in Skyrim and the teams were largely the same up to the launch of 76, so it's not likely that's the reason why there aren't any. Or why they aren't in 4 either.
---
I seen someone get vault 94 ( or is it 64? Can’t remember)stashbox plan on elder tier.
---
Junkie's iirc is apart of the magic bugged weapons
---
It’s bullion, not atoms. It’s no different than buying canned meat stew or any other buff from a vendor
---
Its got it's own cult status, whenever me or my mates find the pipe we all rush to it's location and form a circle, do the mothman dance or kneel then say pipe is life. 
---
If a friend hasn't used it before they get initiated but otherwise we take turns to sniff the pipe.
---
It's the little things like this that keep us amused atm lol
---
YOU CAN WHAT!?
---
I have ditched so many Plasma Gatlings because I didn't see them as worth-while and you tell me that!?
---
Did you miss that part of the questline where they acknowledge caps aren’t sustainable and that’s why they create the new gold economy?
---
I got no issue with that, especially the ammo converter
---
What is this "fast travel" you speak of?  Got to keep the vending machines stocked - Volume, Volume, Volume!  Keep on trudging, my brother, and keep some Vintage Nukashine around for a "quasi-fast travel" experience.
---
I don't know why I can't just carry everything I own with me like I do in every other Bethesda game. Where's my companion? Last time I saw Star she was trying to get the shopping carts through a sandy area. Pull, not push, I say, but she won't listen.
---
the gutter is becoming a legendary craft? finally
---
I've been able to place 4 Gourd per dirt foundation on Xbox - I angle them so the convex side is aimed at the corners, and make a gourd circle.
---
You can't put anything in the middle (minus a Mr. Pebbles plushie to oversee their growth and wellbeing) but it helps to maximize space useage!
---
It might be that they are fixing "magic" damage by looking into ways to optimize server-side calculations, changing how modifications stack is probably easiest as it might have been overly complicated.
---
no nothing in the game bullet sponge except bosses with true build
---
Fix is coming Tuesday I believe
---
It’s also because each run of encrypted costs 1800 and the plan has a 1 in 15 chance of dropping.
---
It’s basically cheaper to buy the plan.
---
Edit: oops I’m sorry I didn’t see how old the post was.
---
The harder it is to get, the cooler you look having one.
---
That's just how trophies are supposed to work.
---
Had to downvote, nothing personal. I understand where you're coming from but I don't agree with you. I don't think they should let us buy levels either, fwiw.
---
Hate it.   It would be so cool to be able to collect specialized weapon and armor sets for different types of enemies, but I'll never have the stash space to do that.  
---
I already keep different types of weapons because after my experience with the legacy TSE gauss, I don't trust them not to completely ruin a specific type of weapon.
---
A few thoughts, just about damage. A lot of your perk slots are taken up by weight reduction perks. If you're able to clear out some stash space/manage inventory a bit differently, that will clear up perk slots for damage perks instead.
---
Upgrade Tank Killer; unequip Green Thumb, only equip it when doing farming runs.
---
Move a point from Endurance to Agility. Drop Aquaboy, upgrade Adrenaline. The closer you can get Adrenaline to 5, the better.
---
Only equip Hard Bargain when selling/buying. Those three points could either be used for Tenderizer or Suppressor, or reassigned between Perception, Agility, or Luck.
---
Swap out Luck of the Draw for Bloody Mess.
---
Also, /u/Chipper7773's comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i9xzrk/i_dont_have_a_specific_build_but_feel_i_could/g1ihj0a/) is full of good advice.
---
I've got various friends complaining about the sheer amount of ammo they need to expend.
---
With no legendary weapons at all its a real grind, specially if you can't get to full build till you reach lv 50 odd, 25 for unarmed melee but then they've never had an ammo problem.
---
Them nerfing everything just makes it harder for players who haven't finished their build yet. Or haven't gotten lucky at all with a decent gun.
---
It might be better than atoms, but I still disagree with the concept of having these items be bought. That’s my perspective, and there’s the fact that bullion is much more fun expensive to justify using on a consumable. Of course, if you have every item you could ever care about, then I suppose it doesn’t matter.
---
100 seems a bit steep
---
It’s cheaper to buy it then pay for the assultron cards to run encrypted.
---
I would rather pay for a plan that costs 10k~ then run a event that costs 1800 each time with a low chance of it dropping.
---
This is misinformation. It was never 200 pounds. It was 400 in both the Alpha and in the B.E.T.A.
---
I agree it should be raised as much as they can though.
---
Ah fair enough, exaggeration still needs to have some artistic limit to invoke intended emotions about it, too much does make it look bad
---
I played in the B.E.T.A. It was definitely 200 before it was 400! Most people forget because we had an infinite carry capacity and infinite stash glitch at the time!
---
They mentioned it in this week’s inside the vault for a potential fix next week.
---
So the word ‘m a r k e t e d’ gets the post removed?
---
Seriously, mods...  you completely ignore the posts where people as saying they’ll buy or sell something, but you remove a post that has *that* word in it?
---
I asked if you had reported it yet. here's what you said:
---
&gt; Not yet but...
---
The PTS has a forum specifically for reporting, so all the information is there and easy for them to collect. Instead of coming here and having to read through post to find information. You didn't even tag anyone from Bethesda.
---
As for complaining. I should have been clearer, that I was making a statement more in general rather than you specific.
---
Yea I mean it’s available if people want them, and if they don’t, they don’t need to buy them. I respect your opinion. I’m just pointing out if it was atoms that definitely would be bad!
---
It would have been a nerf it they would have changed the formulas to take adjusted maximum health instead of possible max health (under current stats).
---
Which I still see as a bug since Fallout 4.
---
Ok well I guess I’m doing other quests for now
---
I said dream requests not actual heaven.
---
I'm pretty sure with change like that they accounted for complaining already
---
Sinks and candles and catbushes, all in front of a machine gun. The invaders like sinks so it's all very efficient, like Ed Begley Jr did camp designs.
---
Lately I've been putting the catbushes higher up, out of harm's way.
---
This. I mostly play on private servers with my friends and between 6 of us who were all bloodied and level 200+ we struggled.
---
The LfG reddit discord is pretty active and fun on Xbox
---
.... I would say yes... But when they add new creatures they don't animate em properly.... Ever crippled a death claw?  Drops cleanly.... Ever crippled a sheep squash?  Just one leg it starts glitching.... Also golpers go cripple one, it'll give you ptsd trying to head shot it without vats, like it can't decide weather to stand or crawl...
---
Season 2 seems much better
---
https://youtu.be/xnF-wmAliXM
---
I used neither of those glitches. The stash space has only been increased twice. Once it increased from 400 to 600. Once more it went from 600 to 800. 
---
It was never 200. My friends and I played everyday of the Alpha. It was 400. Go read the old Inside the Vault article where they announce the Stash size increase.
---
😆😆😆
---
Prepared foods separate from raw foods.
---
It's horrible and I was going to buy Fallout 1st when I thought it would be something like $10-15 a month. In Australia it's $23 a month so screw that! Even buying the year sub it's still $180 ($15 a month) and I'm just not committing for that long.
---
Well, they either have to make enemies bullet spongy to balance with OP builds in mind, or simply fix OP builds so that enemies are not hypersonic bullet-spongy for the rest of the populace
---
and thats how It should be without finishing your build game shouldn't be easy I am using mutant fixer and mutant bow fixer is 1\* mutant and bow is mutant/33 vats and right now game is easy even to me I can kill everything even with only %10 buff from mutant effect we really need nerf and they finally add it
---
Ya cost to performance is pretty bad. I don’t mind if someone already has all the plans but not everyone has every single plan yet. I bet that they will continue to add gold bullion plans in the future.
---
50 gold per buy seems more reasonable.
---
Theors a difference between challenging and fun gameplay vs making everything a grind bullet sponge.
---
It seems unarmed was hit super hard. My gauntlets are now doing about 80% less damage where my shotgun is about 45% less. 
---

*dont*
---
Either it's fixed or it becomes desolate wasteland of a game
---
Full health all Vanguard armor build with Ironclad prevents most problems, combined with a few good rifles and keeping your distance from major threats prevents even more problems, combined with mutations and public teams (+3 to all stats with Herd Mentality and a team with teammates) prevents even more.
---
Im so glad we can still get lunchboxes
---
I love that these are challenging. I hope they don’t nerf them because people complain.
---
Someone showed me that the other day. A few Molotov cocktails for your low level buddy and some quick power cleanup afterwards, and they will skyrocket in levels.
---
That's why I play with damage numbers off.
---
I also give my characters a little backstory and then use gear that fits it, not just "DA BEST."
---
It's more fun when I'm not driving myself nuts over how to do tweaks to maximize my numbers, and I don't lose my mind and make a bunch of posts about quitting because my numbers might potentially be changed, maybe. 
---
Like, damn. I thought video games were to have fun, not a spreadsheet balance stress simulator. Some of those people need to find an accountant sim.
---
I think they need to divide the cost and rewards of all gold bullion stuff by 10, so you get 1 gold bullion per note and things that are now 100 cost 10, going off what we pay as it is gold must be virtually worthless, a gold bullion is a lot of gold :-)
---
Don't see a problem when I say.
---
Not yet. 
---
Lemme translate: NO, BUT I WILL DO LATER.
---
Other than: No. Or: No I won't.
---
I'd like to have both, the higher cap so I can safe up for more than one serum recipe at a time and am not scared to hit the cap with my player vendor and the second for when I got all those ungodly expensive plans and need to dump caps until there are new ones
---
Gives people reasons to continue with bullion. I just finally reached peak reputation with the raiders so now can get some nice things. Almost feel like I wasted all my bullion on secret service armor that I probably won’t ever wear
---
You know how the build perks are also being nerfed right? They're nerfing EVERYTHING! Meta powerful guns will still be powerful, but lesser guns will have to waste much more ammo.
---
Absolutely nothing lol
---
I struggle with this, nukes went off all over the place, everything gone to piss, however, the golf balls remained untouched🤦‍♂️
---
I like that confetti on the wall too.
---
Please tell me it isn't as rough to get as the last events items were
---
gregorian? lol gregory chant is now my favorite artist
---
They should 1000% update the UI for the pip boy menu in future releases. Like from oblivion to Skyrim was a MASSIVE upgrade. But fallout has had the same  one, but more shit since 3. I don’t want to push the triggers or scroll through 30 other sub-menus tbh. And in a game like 76 where it’s online it’s like if you need something in your inv, with any speed, you’re fucked
---
yeah, and considering your post and comment history.
---
Not yet really comes across as a way to cover the fact that you have no intention too. Since you also said that posting it here counts as bug reporting. When it doesn't.
---
So from your own words, I have good reason to doubt you. Your one of the market players. You spend a lot of time there. So you use the PTS server as a sneak peak on how to get the best stuff in game to for your market game.
---
The stash size was never 200 it was 400 to start with.. Here is the very first Inside the Vault Article: 
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/6OWNNxTBMAsMmIwGOs8U8/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-november-27-2018
---
Here’s a quote about the first patch to ever hit Fallout 76. 
---
“Stash Limit Increased: We know many of you have been asking for an adjustment to the Stash storage limit, and we’re happy to share that we’re increasing it from 400 to 600. While this is somewhat conservative, we plan to increase the storage cap further once we verify that this change will not negatively impact the stability of the game.“
---
Anyone saying otherwise is either lying, and they never played the Alpha, or has a bad memory.
---
No, this is good. It balances weapons and builds while still keeping bloodied at the top. So you only do 2-3 more damage than others and not 10 times more.
---
Stop whining, you will still be powerful.
---
Just did it and it still works.
---
Do you even need to buy stims? I sell 20-50 every day after doing my daily routine (maybe 1-2h) They drop constantly from what I played and you are way better off making ammo instead of buying it, get yourself the ammo factory perk to increase yield (super duper too if you are that far), also I hope you are only buying at players as most people just sell ammo for a cap each instead of anything more as vendors might
---
Hopefully, this will egg Bethesda onto the path of a "respec" button for your S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats for those that wish to modify their playstyle without grinding 30+ levels. I'd personally enjoy being able to modify my stats/load out to be better equipped for each encounter
---
don't worry about it. honestly. your numbers are too low to flag any auto ban though you might find your weapons missing at some point.
---
just enjoy the power while it lasts.
---
It could definitely be explained in better detail. However, the menu buttons at each step do show the options available.
---
There seems to be a divide between people who don’t like challenge and those who like a sense of accomplishment.
---
3 lunchbox means %75 more xp and certain buff It is fine
---
Doesn't it use plasma cartridges?
---
If you're upset about using too many of those, I guess you've never used a plasma flamer, ha.
---
If betting on NW was accessible from Adventure that would be really funny to me, lore wise they'd probably need to say it's a "simulation" for it to make sense and as we know it's not that's kind of hilarious and dark, unknowingly participating in funding a murder-game
---
i once met a random in whitesprings (when explo shotguns still crippled) we took our time with the ghuls then started a random driving range like golf competition with explo guns.
---
felt like driving with a sandwedge but still... good times...
---
Generally yes. However, if this is your first character and you plan to run others up to level 50 so you can hit the purveyor with multiple players - especially during sales (you can save up 1000 scrip on each character and then hiit during a sale)- a few low-mid level legendary weapons and armor can be "hand me downs" and make the new characters advancement easier and more fun till you get at least 4/5 characters over the level 50 line. At that point sell (they have value to low level players) or scrip the low level legendaries. 
---
It now makes sense to leave a character very low for easy "level up" challenges and recycle them frequently to keep them babies for this purpose. 
---
I personally recommend this strategy. However if you are very keen on legendary perks (if they ever arrive) you may prefer to just drive for higher level and more slots on your one character. In that case wait till level 50 to buy.
---
I just go and activate it and it shuts up.
---
Being an inconvenience is a lot different than being completely unable to do something. Berserker and bloodied can’t tank dmg. TS just requires a chem. Junkie’s builds have to do 5x that and give up multiple perk slots to achieve the same effect.
---
I think it is a combo of two things, the Wiki is a pain in the ass to navigate, and a lot of older players have left.
---
Additionally some info is rather hard to access like previous atom store items as they change weekly.
---
Dude it is freaking working, you sir are a master, let me ask.smth, in how much time they will regrow? Considering I remain in the same pvt server?
---
This is me with my Quad explosive harpoon gun with most enemies at mid to close range.
---
I agree they should have, at least in theory.
---
I was taking poetic license. It works for vegetables in your camp as well as nuked flora.  Good good for pumpkin house as well.
---
Workshops have a defined build space. Not square. If you want more information please read through what I have already said. It’s not impossible to do a cube, but you have to create each space by hand. Workshops boundaries don’t change.
---
Yeeeeah, if that's going to Live then I ain't playing the Ops.  It'd be one thing if it was only certain enemies (like Mutant Hounds) being able to sniff you out of Stealth, but every single enemy?  Nah, fuck that.  I despise AI cheatey bullshit like that.
---
Do you really "hate to be anti-fun" cause it woulda taken exactly nothing to not say that
---
maybe add in a few human NPCs as visitors too, which can give you some quests, tell interesting stories or just give you tips for gambling \^\^ in general it's a great idea for the top of the world but they'd have problems with the story as the interior is needed for that and making it an instanced one which is specific to your group would be less fun as you wouldn't get to meet the other player visitors
---
Bloodied is the best tank with the right gear and perk cards.
---
FYI I think it will be available to buy with gold
---
That's over £60,000,000 worth of gold IRL assuming a 12.5 kg bullion.
---
Oh my, that's 6 lunchboxes a day.  Look under your chair!  YOU get free XP and YOU get free XP and YOU get free XP, YOU ALL get free XP!
---
150 atoms per level
---
exactly this. for those of us who can't play everyday, having a weekly limit on currencies makes much more sense.
---
They can't legally charge you real money in any way or they will loose entire countries player bases, it would also ensure that they will never be able to sell us caps or make atoms convertible into caps at any point
---
Just because it was a beneficial glitch doesn't make it any less a glitch, though. If you're permanently running on just a sliver of health to get maximum boosts, dying easily, and therefore a lot, is kind of the point, otherwise there's no drawback to running a bloodied build.
---
You are doing God's work reporting this :)
---
Be careful, BoS fangirls may come after you.
---
I think it’s more to push 1st because of the Scrapbox. I don’t buy the server stability bs either, especially given that 1st is an option and I’ve seen duper’s with 100’s of thousands of an item with no noticeable server issues.
---
And weirdly good teeth....
---
Poison resist, bud.
---
Poison resist.
---
no, check the profile icon 100% early teen
---
I'm talking about scorch beast, not SBQ.
---
It's not just that though the health regeneration on the mutations has been debuffed as well as stimpacks don't give as much of a boost as they used to. They are taking everything away.
---
I play pretty irregular hours and don't usually talk a lot but you sound fun. I'm LargeWoodenRabbit
---
I personally believe it to be a glitch:
---
formulas to take maximum health without adjusting to max health reductions, such as radiation.
---
Play the game maybe? That's why you buy a game in first place.
---
I'm only upset because now I gotta unload the bloody weapons I've been waiting to trade at a loss.
---
They could have it as a location off-map with the expedition system and have NPCs at the faction HQs which you can talk to to bring you there, similar as to how they did it with DLCs in FO4 but not at such a large scale, might work but there are other in-map options, I really don't think it's unlikely some wastelander would want to open a casino, it's just such a post-apocalypse thing to do
---
And I had stated somewhere else that I’m hoping, as many of the devs are bloodied build who appear to prefer lvling like the rest of us, they’ll see how much they’re inconveniencing us. But that’s the thing! Even out are mutations doing less for us, the food and chems that can boost our str do less now, and even the str skill is worth much less, those numbers boosters are so important for us to achieve the amount of dmg most players consider unfair that now we’ll have to carry around every chem and meat item just to stay competitive, and I guarantee bloodied will burn out fast if that’s the case as the biggest draw to that vs junkies was it required less work/items to upkeep.
---
Exploring and piecing together information on how to git gud are main aspects of any Fallout game and so it is for F76
---
Reminds me of the small bunkers in Fallout 2
---
When does this hit?
---
Now I want more clowns, enough for a full creepy-clown themed camp.
---
Also... the greenbrier has a casino IRL
---
Oh I definitely like all the super mutant ideas! I feel like they need to be a bit tougher.
---
I have quite a few, and I'm all for this.
---
Though I am biased since it barely affects my builds.
---
If they're as crazy and challenging as op says then I'm happy im one of the ones that loved vault 94 and grinded it to oblivion and I've been jonesin for some more challenging content. Its what this game needs for players like us and HOPEFULLY people won't complain about how hard they are because there's plenty of easy content to do anyway. Personally I just want my character to die more I want to actually feel THREATENED in the wasteland again.
---
After playing Grounded, I'm good. The experience of fighting a giant fucking spider is terrifying
---
I would really love to find it and taste it in japan.
---
Atta girl!
---
I have seen 0 improvement with lone wanderer. Should stats or effects change when it is equipped?
---
Yes. I food and aid for sure. Don’t see a problem with armor and clothing either.
---
Just change server and you can start again,then go back to your private. Just remember to never complete the quest step with your character.  I have no clue on regrow timers.
---
VATS drains power cores quickly in PA.
---
Yeah, I'm happy about this, I get it when people don't agree with a change like the walls for example. But this is a very very tiny thing to sacrifice so all levels can enjoy the whole map again. 
---
Bloodied is still going to one-shot 90% of the time, people just get upset by tiny changes.
---
Im trying to compromise.  Of course I remember before, its the only reason I logged into this game every day to do them. That was fun for me. I wont log in daily just to earn score.  It would be a acceptable middle ground between what we have now vs what we had before.
---
People have proven that wrong so many times. With all defensive perks cards vs a full health build the bloodied’s hp is still only worth 75% of a full hp build. It’s less than 40% once they equip the exact same cards. You don’t even need to be a tank build to outclass us in health and dmg reduc
---
Yeah, the fact that things on display or for sale count towards the storage limit makes no sense (i.e. my doors and walls do not), and just feels like a cynical push towards Fallout 1st.
---
maybe the radiation did not make them bigger but SMALLER.
---
Nano-Sized Rad-Spiders everywhere...
---
I’m not sure how to answer this. It said it was pocketed. If you want just the raider arm plan you would buy raider arms.
---
Always felt Bloodied was wayyyyyy too OP. 
---
Good to see instead of nerfing or buffing over effects. They nerfed everything. 
---
Wonder what the new meta will be
---
This isn't an exploit. It's how the game is and how it multiplies damage. Stop being ignorant.
---
Very interested to see what we can do with some of this items like the shooting gallery, train set, and foosball table. The prefab looks nice though. Oh and the workout bench is very cool.
---
And you haven't seen the ones that are invisible untill they attack you. No sneak or vats on those lol.
---
Nice thanks :) anyone know when this starts ?
---
My apologies, yes you were right. The weapon is 3 star. Explosive, +50 Damage Resistance while aiming and +50% more damage when target is below 40% health.
---
pipe, pipe is always the same.
---
also its life
---
the problem I see is a raider on psycho would kill them, take their stuff, and kick the bench over
---
I like it and you do already find lone, non-hostile raiders as random encounters, like the one who wants his picture taken for his kid, so maybe there's a chill raider out there, keep looking
---
I know there's fishing overalls buy I don't remember when you find them
---
I hope it's a vault you can build, it's all I did in FO4, going to be such a huge let down if not. I'd even be happy if it was a pack you had to buy from the atom shop.
---
Yeah I think those ones are in whitesprings, but there is another type that look like farmers ones. Thanks tho!
---
No....just no
---
800 or 8000 doesnt matter, I'm a horder so I'll always be close to my max.
---
Guessing you're using an RX 5700 XT or similar?
---
I welcome the changes, there needs to be more back and forth between players and pve, and damage output is way too high atm for any exchange to happen in the first place.
---
Losers love to pretend spending more than a bullet on an enemy means everything takes ages to kill and leads to infinite ammo grinding.
---
Now they just need to reduce sneaking efficiency so you're not virtually invulnerable by virtue of being invisible all the time and add a reason to not care about dying.
---
Been here since the xbox pre beta. I remember in a qna beth said they couldn't give us more storage, its one thing being able to increase that number later but being able to store INFINITE junk if you sub to fo1st is inexcusable. They shouldn't have to prop up their membership program with the ability to pick up everything you want and store infinite junk items. Screw me for wanting to collect weapons right. Because of them I have to choose between collecting weapons and storing junk when a fo1st user gets to store 800lbs of guns when I only have about 100 if I want to keep a decent stock of materials, all because he decided to break out his wallet. Beth should be able to moneitze their live service games, but only through cosmetic means.
---
Some really cool stuff in here, but honestly.....WE NEED MORE HANDMADE RIFLE SKINS.
---
The clean toilet is already in the files, there is no excuse for it not to be released.
---
God I'd love some sensitivity sliders
---
ran out of things to buy for bullion ages ago, glad to have a reason to still hit up smiley and turn in treasury notes
---
Agreed. Though I will mention that they’ll be giving out chems, stimpacks and radaway in this next season as more filler content.
---
I play a bloodied melee sneak build, and am fine with the change.
---
I'm sure it wont be the end all of their tinkering either. Will make it easier to put in more meaningful adjustments from this new baseline moving forward. 
---
The spongiest enenies in this game arent even half as bad as some are in other games. And dont forget soon it will be easier than ever to maintain high levels of your preferred ammo.
---
would love to see other build become more viable and bring some new potential builds to the playing field.
---
What I'm really hoping for down the line is that legendaries and area bosses get buffs to make them more of a unique threat. 
---
Especially bring deathclaws, sentrys and other rare cryptids up to the level of the sheepsquatch at least, for starters.
---
While enemies being tankier isnt necessarily sexy it's a start that can be built upon in the future.
---
Some adjustments for the loot tables wouldn't hurt either, to up the draw of putting in the effort to down difficult enemies.
---
I never got to play the older fallout games, but hearing how area boss mobs used to be these incredible threats that instilled fear into players when they showed up is really appealing to me.
---
I crave encounters that force me to think a bit more about how I'll deal with them. 
---
There will be growing pains to reach those preferred balances but they will be for the better in the end.
---
&gt;He was soo incredibly disappointed and upset by "how much they ruined the game with their nerfs" while simultaneously two tapping a level 100 super mutant. 
---
Yup, dude also did a daily ops, managed to get Paladin rank on his first go, having no idea what he was doing, solo, and whined and bitched the entire time it was too hard then said he'd never do it again.  LMAO.
---
It's meant for a party and he breezed through it and complains it's too hard.  Christ these people.
---
Finally a good use for all that gold bullion thats been building up.
---
Displays cases, ally clothing and player vendor stuff should appear at the BOTTOM of the stash list.
---
Are you sure you didn't accidentally use a diluted stimpak or something? Because that's happened to me before. 
---
I only carry supers but sometimes I forget to get rid of regulars or diluted from rewards and have to spam the hotkey when one gets used instead of a super.
---
They said in the ITV that it will be patched on Tuesday IIRC
---
Patch 22. We just don't know when that will be released.
---
I always thought that a cool idea would be to have a prefab "warehouse" or "shed" that you place at your camp and it costs budget, but in return, you get a reduction of wt. Like food/drink weighs nothing if you build the "Food Storage Shed" and as a little bonus, the shed would visually update and have little food items appear on shelves, etc. 
---
Same thing for ammo, chems, scrap, plans, etc. 
---
I hope some kind of storage solution is in the works or at least a way for non-1st members to deal with scrap.
---
I'll did through my collection latellr today and see if I can figure it out
---
Im a bloody build and I dont mind it at all. It will still out damage all the other stuff. Hopefully some newer builds will be viable.
---
Please add /s lol
---
Straight snitch.
---
So slow but
---
Thanks! No stress tho
---
It was fine how it was before. We also knew what the best gear was to get the highest damage output possible and grinded our asses off to get it, and now it’s basically the same as any other combo thanks to these changes. Making a build around certain weapons also barely increases the damage anymore. That’s pretty much 9 points in strength, perception, or agility that adds like 30 damage. It just feels like a waste compared to what we had
---
Dude...
---
Gotta find a good set with that on never realised how deadly it was until met a group of te one day ouchhh
---
Yea I don’t really see the point in that, but also 100 skins and camp items would just be too much haha
---
Now we just need the exercise bike.
---
They could add escort missions at various locations throughout the map, and the further you go the higher the reward
---
So what missions can we play in the meantime? Am stuck on main quest just like half this mob. PLEASE ENLIGHTEN US ALL, What missions are playable at this time?
---
I believe this way would work out better though.
---
Considering basically this games meta is be bloodied, not well built or anything. But just being bloodied and very little won't be one shot, what isn't one shot goes down so fast it may as well of been. 
---
I can't see one wasteland changing that because at best with out a rebalancing, low leveled characters would still have most of their issues being some high level has the damage of a god.
---
i'm the other 1  
---
the pipe revolver in 4 had a .308 receiver and the comfort grip from the normal pipe pistol  
---
please bring those parts and other missing weapons and parts into 76?
---
It's not nerfing damage, it's fixing a bug, it never should have been that way in the first place.
---
It's not making anything more challenging, you're still able to one-shot shit.  And with One Wasteland it will be higher level shit so you'll get more XP while one-shotting it.  And with easy access to lunchboxes it's going to be even more XP.
---
So they just made shit so much easier and you're here derping that it's the opposite.
---
But as to your "they could make things challenging other ways" yeah, it's called Daily Ops and stuff is more challenging there in a variety of ways.
---
They very nicely put the actual challenge away behind an optional mode because had they ACTUALLY made stuff more challenging with mutations people would be throwing a hissy fit.
---
the ratty skirt also spawns on the counter at 'live chic'. camden amusement park is a good low level area and you get the camden employee skirt for a quest there. you can find the civil war era dress at the battlefield and the witch dress at freddy fears house of scares
---
When was the last time you played?
---
I think First should have better benefits such as being able to save the state of workshops, unlimited stash, and much less limited CAMP budget.
---
First should basically be like Fallout 4.
---
We’re used to playing that way, and were fine with it. If you didn’t like it, play a different build. Besides, Beth nerfed everything, not just Bloodied.
---
Weaker legendaries compared to end game ones will become closer damage wise. Ex bloodied and junkies was so far apart damage wise but now their closer. Bloodied still being the most damage.
---
Ofc damage was nerfed on everything, But, that’s expected when they change buffs to stack additively.
---
Well they are adding them to tank killer perk card pool.so it's a start
---
Pay me with stable cobalt flux and I'm game.
---
The meta won't change.. contrary to all the bloody-haters opinions, it will just take more ammo for everyone to kill anything.
---
Still grinding paradise?
---
Oooh how about parasytic spiders, that when you unknowingly kill an infected mob they burst out and are these ridiculously tall monstrosities that chase you around relentlessly. 
---
Could even make a cursed effect where after being bitten your body spawns small spiders for a period of time after for a duration similar to the poision / acid , or could make it a disease.
---
Could make an advantage where the disease has a spider limb grow randomly somewhere on your body giving additional mele damage. 
---
Then when you eventually die you spawn another massive spider to that area similar to the bloatfly syringer effect. Ah and speaking of add it as a new syringer effect!
---
Man I need to start making my own games.
---
He’s right it started at 400 in the Alpha. 
---
Very first Inside the Vault article talking about the first Fallout 76 patch:
---
i agree 100%. you should make that a seperate post, enjoyed the read. very comprehensive and true.
---
Big talk.
---
Pistols get a bump as the armor piercing perk tank killer now applies. That’s a huge bump in damage specifically for pistols. Relative to other weapons, pistols will actually be better than before.
---
It really isn’t that bad. Do your research on what armor is going to work best for your play style and only worry about the plans that will best suit you for that. Alternatively, if you go to grafton station you can just buy the brotherhood of steel armor upgrades for combat armor, which is the best upgrade for damage and energy resistance you can get for all combat armor classes. Or grind out to get enough gold bullion to get the secret service armor which only has one class which has the highest damage/energy/radiation resistances so far. Regardless, most people will stick to one armor type. Once you’ve sort of maxed out your character you’ll change your armor as much as a turtle changes its shell.
---
Giant snakes filled with even gianter spiders!
---
I wish I had your stash space
---
I will take it as joke, btw the legendary rebalancing is on the right direction, but they should buff some underwhelming weapons 1st
---
Not really, just a fact.
---
I agree so much with you.. sometimes i hate to read comments or posts from the community because they don't know what they want.. Right now the game is super easy.. For example, my girlfriend play for the first time of her life an action shooter game and after 3 months she told me that there is no real challenge in the game! She is not a pro, she was super excited at first because she (we) had so many things to do in game. 
---
Now we log in and we do only the daily/weekly challenges and we log off. Nothing interesting to do or to see. Personally, i have craft full SS armor with mods but she feels that there is no real reason for an end game armor..
---
Would like to see it upped to 1000, just because that seems like a nicer number..
---
In game there’s fishing overalls, farmers outfit, and miners uniforms. Otherwise the rest are all atom shop.
---
Cool, thanks.
---
You don't really need any perks, it's already powerful and completely spamable.
---
I wish there was a way to flag items as "favorites" so at least you get the chicken box.
---
This is why I refuse to watch any gaming related YouTube videos, they're all obnoxious overdramic idiots screeching about nonsense to get views. I don't understand why people go all fanboi over streamers or even watch them in the first place. Maybe I'm just too old for that nonsense, I dunno.
---
I just finished my entire Blueridge outfit collection and got my pepperoni roll recipe. We need more Blueridge asap.
---
It does look pretty bad
---
I think the armor and green house set are pretty cool... and that bunker
---
I cant keep up with all these changes. I'm a casual player who doesnt have much time.I guess ai nwed to read up on the stuff. We can now scrap perk cards? How does that work?
---
I think one or 3 per pack might be a bit more interesting, making it so you have to quickly identify who has the sight, nail them, then book it to a safe place.
---
I really dig the game board and the general style of the season two stuff.
---
Hopefully they have better ways to earn score this time around, because the slog for season one really turned me off from the game and I decided to just put it down for a few weeks. If they made it like Call or Duty’s/Fortnite’s battle passes, which you pay some points upfront but you’re not limited on advancement it would be much better. There is no way I’ll spend an hour and a half a day grinding XP to do the season two stuff, even though I think the content is rad and the art style is great for season two. That honestly ruins the game experience. If they made events/quests/dailies/legendary enemy give out score then people could continue to enjoy the game while still ranking up. As is it’s a choice between grind and enjoyment and I already work long hours, I shouldn’t need to slave away for something intended to be fun.
---
Cool Ty
---
Well the good news is most items will remain rare/unique. I think it’s ok if players want to use their in-game currency when many will not have anything to do with it soon enough. Especially since those items did actually provide a useful service, would be a shame if others just never got them.
---
That’s true. Even though they’re gonna make all weapons garbage too so you’ll have to spend time farming ammo. And you can’t switch to melee bc melee weapons have been hit hardest.
---
a wrongly places nuke suddenly  exposes an underground network of caves...
---
Event: Kill it with FIRE!!!!
---
That might be the steel worker outfit, I think it was farmer.
---
Edit: [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Steel\_worker\_uniform](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Steel_worker_uniform)
---
greenhouse set is indeed nice, but... it's available on rank 99 to bait people buying the missing ranks.
---
That would be awesome.
---
Link?
---
Freak out much? 
---
Best for longterm game play. Everything is effected by this in the same way. It’s just that the more bonuses you used, the more it will effect your build. Also, pistols got a buff by being added to the tank killer perk.
---
that shoots spiders when it hisses at you.
---
They already did it with the honey beasts.
---
Dont remember mod name, check wiki, and they are worth while for sure, good starting heavy gun and cores everywhere
---
agreed. like I said. mixed feelings. 
---
I just am never fond of how FOMO makes it so gaming companies have to offer everyone everything. The whole collector mentality of must have, even if it's of only cosmetic value.
---
And now with teams we can more quickly build a group to do them.
---
https://discord.gg/Bqg3nP
---
There are loyal players who aren't relentless min/maxers.  Maybe not as many as there should be, but that might be because those of us who don't ruthlessly squeeze every possible buff out of the game design aren't having as much fun, because of the extreme power disparity.  Which is what they want to fix.  The ideal game design lets power gamers feel some tangible benefit from their fine-tuning, but not so much that it discourages other types of players from enjoying the game.
---
I dont think there is a stagger perk but the xhest piece I have reduces stagger for its mod which helps a bit. I can't fit any more perks in anywhere without breaking my current build but once legendary perks come along i should be able to solve that problem.
---
As for the pulse grenades I don't find enough of them to be that useful because I come across these robots way too often but it is defently good advice.
---
Based on my experience, if this goes live, Colossal Problem will really live up to the name.  If you get stuck in an instance with mostly unoptimized players, Earle is a PITA to put down.  This is just going to make it even worse.
---
I can see why they opted for this approach, because magic weapons are now omnipresent at every event, but an elegant solution it is not.
---
Or just complete the season like normal. 
---
If people want to spend atoms they can. That’s how they make money and afford to develop new stuff for the game.
---
I have all plans except two super rare plans on one character. I'm not doing it again on the others.
---
Yeah but those are smol bees
---
So what you are saying is i need to completely respec just to launch a nuke?
---
As does just about anything in PA does. 
---
That's what cracks me up about players living in PA. it's often more work than what you get out of it.
---
I'd more likely loudly scream NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooooooooo.
---
I do think I have a mild case of arachnophobia.
---
That subjugator outfit will look great on gramps as he becomes a guard in my communist re-education center. There wastelanders will learn to assemble Huawei cell phones. It will have free healthcare for "voluntary" sterilization, a shower room and 3 incinerators for "waste".
---
This is disappointing.
---
Yup. I'm at that point on all my alts. They're all specific builds, so *most* bullion items aren't in their interest. My full health unarmed build picked up Solar armor, gauss shotgun, and the Gauntlet (haven't used it since I've got a godroll powerfist, but...) and that's pretty much it, since that's all he has a use for. My main HW/PA dude already has Minigun, Caster, T-65 (which I don't use since I've got a legacy Ultracite set), and that's all he needs. My Bloodied Melee and Bloodied Rifleman each got full SS... and that's all they have a use for. So for them, Lunchboxes are perfect. And they're cheap! It's like 100 bullion for 3. Which means each day I can buy *6*
---
They really should just steal the better inventory mod and make it standard for all. That way console players can also benefit from that mod.
---
Q.Q ^(no...)
---
Do
---
Not everyone is as lucky as you are. And yes I’ve had a mic for years.
---
YES, I use both of them and love them, they need attention
---
you are right. No perk to reduce stagger. Maybe there in in the Legendary perks. but there's certainly mods that help.
---
Try and find the plans for the pulse grenade.
---
Ah man would have fun making people chase after me with all my speed perks on XD.
---
It feels like it because we are going backwards lmao
---
It makes sense to me.  Seems foolish to create all those skins and assets only to have the disappear after the summer ends.  Bullion buys are a great idea.
---
how could i forget? some loser mentions it like every 3 hours
---
The fatman of Appalachia
---
with the current system which is also on pts players have to play at least 5days a week competing all challenges INCLUDING 4x double S.C.O.R.E weekends.
---
if you miss one week with double score due to vacation or any other reasons you can't play each day straight for 3 months, you are forced to buy in if you want the rewards. the system is implemented to generate money out of people who don't want their "work" wasted only reaching rank 60 or something. it's psychological, human beings don't like unfinished projects they worked for a long time.
---
supporting the devs will be much more popular once they fix this shit and stop screwing with us. they charge 15€ for first, a premium subscription for a buy2play game without signifcant advantages or a propper customer support. every other game with subscriptions is cheaper, more polished and has a working support team.
---
I can’t tell if you’re joking or not.
---
To much duping?
---
Idk, I’ll have to check. Probably the same story though.
---
I don't know if bloodied was the main problem in the first place. It's the fact that unyielding is so incredibly good that I can't NOT be a low health build anymore.
---
The incredible carry weight and incredible AP is so hard to pass up.
---
How about I kick you in the nuts you give me all your caps leaving you the feeling like you lost at the Casino :)
---
I don’t mind it much. Some of my characters don’t need 90% of the plans available for gold. So I have a pile of gold slowly inching towards the cap. It would be nice to have a consumable to spend the gold on.
---
Drop em
---
No, not 2 bullets of a perfect bloodied build you liar, crap dies in 1 shot to no build gimp just walking around.
---
If you're running around not stacking damage YOU WON'T EVEN SEE A DIFFERENCE.
---
For fuck sakes people, THIS IS NOT A DAMAGE NERF.  This is a STACKING BUG FIX.  If you're just running around and not stacking things like bloodied + nerd rage + adrenal reaction, THEN YOU WILL NOT SEE A DIFFERENCE.
---
Secret service
---
Fast food!
---
That is big news, be nice to see some new craftable weapons.
---
I’d go for stranglers heart
---
Nope, you can only drop them
---
Shoot the legs, cripple it.
---
Which one ?!?!!?!?
---
YES!!!
---
They didn't nerf anything, they fixed a stacking bug.
---
If you aren't stacking multiple effects YOU WON'T SEE ANY CHANGE AT ALL.
---
Is it a lot better?
---
^ this. Why focus on ‘rebalancing’ something that’s already bugged? It’s never occurred to them that fixing the bugs would probably address the ‘unbalanced’ nature of much of the game.
---
deposit them in the nearest overseer stash.
---
I really hate this idea.
---
If you call being able to 1-shot stuff an ammo sponge, don't come in these forums spreading your idiocy.
---
I’m not interested in going back and forth on this. You aren’t happy. I get it. Some people just like to enjoy the game.
---
It’s confirmed that the perk works for pistols?
---
That's a good solution for Season-exclusive items. Even buying Lunchboxes for gold is a good idea. It gives a way to spend gold for those people who don't have anything to buy for their characters.
---
Do you use the perk that lowers the amount of resources it takes to build camp items?
---
Maybe blueprints don't work with that 
---
Just asking cuz I'm curious what the bug specifically could be lol
---
And I'm assuming you only have the 2 generators and nothing else in the blueprint?
---
Going to have to test this to see if it's repeatable. (need to build a camp on a low level alt anyways)
---
In its current state, this update is basically forcing bloodieds into a box that was already pretty tight to begin with. I always thought the optimized builds deserved some more attention to be comparable to us, but now people are already buying catch-all prefixes like mutant’s or TS. I don’t understand why non-optimized or farm builds think their stats should be comparable to someone who has thrown half their perks cards into maintaining their build type. If the rewards isn’t there where we’re visibly more capable then no one will want optimized builds anymore and favor generic play styles
---
Yeah, that's what contractor is. Regardless, it wouldn't be possible to have 3 gears be used in 2 generators since they couldn't possibly take 1.5 gears each
---
No. Stop right there.
---
At least someone got it lol
---
You still could at 50 each :-)
---
I don't care what game you're playing but if you ever find yourself needing to use a glitch to stay alive I think it's time to rethink your build or strategy.
---
Just 2 medium generators and a connecting cable between them
---
I bought every buyable plan on all 5 characters because there weren’t enough cap sinks. You still have options
---
Commando, expert commando and master commando is a stacking buff!
---
Those crappy rewards will be helpful for new players. For vets though it’s shit.
---
The difference between strangers and secret service in defense is not that noticeable but having that set bonus proc with strangers is nice
---
yet another person who don't know how conversations work using a platform where people are intended to have conversations... let me guess, all you want is to post your opinion without any intention to actually give a fuck about others opinion or at least accept them, right?
---
i know your point, but it sounds stupid compared the whole gaming market. also it's dumb since you support how they act with us and don't resist if they fuck with us even more. that's the definition of ignorance imo.
---
we all want to enjoy the game for obvious reasons. but if the devs don't make it enjoyable for so many players, aren't this the biggest sign they are doing it wrong?
---
"We heard your complaints about the filler and decided to give you MORE FILLER!!"
---
If you feel the need to just go around reporting people for having an ammo plant I feel sorry for you.
---
Are you looking for marsupial?  Or just not part of your build?
---
I've gotta say, the BoS bunker looks cool, but i cant say im gonna change my camp around to add it and everything else is just mehh.  Im not going to use the red chinese version of Combat armour any more than im gonna use the ghillie version.
---
Thats not my issue, if they could do it awesome! But I fear they cannot...
---
I don't it's just an observation just changed my  play style that's all and it's not just the lifegiver bounce back. They have nerfed the regeneration from mutation and stimpacks the initial boost is gone.
---
First that’s not what a hoax is. Save the drama for the stage and your mama.
---
But I think this would be a good time to try multiple reward options at some spots. Would you like rad kit. Health kit, or vault tec supply crate.
---
I also don’t think that list is completely season rewards. Some of it is BoS themed, and is probably a bundle from the ATX
---
Well, if you bought most useful plans and don't feel like you need anything else. This is a cool addition. There are a lot of things you buy with bullion that aren't worthy to me.
---
I bet you are one of those who begged dupers for a fixer a month ago
---
I would be a pistol user if they didn't suck.  I would love "That Gun" to come back.
---
Not sure but dilutes used to give a little boost at first.
---
That's a good point lol weird
---
Didn't help :( but one thing I did notice. I can't find Fallout 76 music folder anywhere
---
Edit: I find sound folders do you have any idea why they doesn't work?
---
Well, because of 1 wasteland, enemies are going to take more hits, but they are also gonna give more xp, deal more damage themselves and drop better loot if you’re at a high enough lvl. So that sounds better to me. If enemies are higher level, that sounds like a cooler challenge. But if you want to view damage nerf and level increase as things are now more spongy go right ahead. At the end game, your concern really shouldn’t be ammo. If it is, then trade away a semi decent gun or two that you never use for ammo or the junk to craft it. Just last night, I traded a gun for 7k lead, 2k steel, and 3k caps. The LMG is probably one of the least ammo efficient guns in the game (second only to the minigun), but if that’s what you run, that’s a choice you make.
---
Too many refunds? You should have replied that it was due to the fact that what they sell you has too many problems, hence the need for refunds...
---
If you want a bullet sponge...
---
try the new Colossus. 
---
I'm not sure how much is the damage nerf and how much is just his resistances.
---
But I was hitting for 23 damage on headshots with my B HW/Explosive build with a Primed BE 50cal.
---
That's compared to roughly 100 damage to the queen.
---
I burned up a toooooon of prime'd ammo downing that bastard (it was me and 1 other dude who seemed to have an infinite supply of mininukes... I don't think they hurt the colossus much but they helped keep the adds clear). Should be better with a full team.
---
On the upside, the daily operations? Replenish your ammo! Especially if you're being efficient as a damage dealer! I gained more ammo than I lost with my BE50cal.
---
Enemies drop the ammo type you hit them with, or the ammo type of your equipped gun; not clear on which but I was getting huge stacks of 5mm when I was using my gatling gun [I think it's tuned for minigun] and decent enough stacks of Ultracite .50 when I used my 50cal, to the point where if I made sure not to overkill, I finished the run with more ammo than I started. Which after downing Earl, was a huge relief.
---
Yes, PS4 and apparently Xbox, but not PC yet (that we know of). 
---
I really wish I had tips, that’s part of why I made this post, to find a solution or to see if someone can help. 
---
All I’ve seen so far is to take vending down, some have even had theirs disabled already, and one player suggested not to have your camp at max budget because it makes it easier to be hacked (but I’m not sure how this works, but I’ll try anything to keep my stuff).
---
All in all, it’s a good idea with the upcoming and recent updates, to CYA
---
Just to warn you the letters on that sign take over 40 items or walls of your budget.
---
well, excuse my spelling, i'm not native englisch. for me a hoax means bullshit, a set up thing which is just faked.
---
Super excited for dungeon like system, the increase difficulty and the legendary perks!! Yeah!! I wanna see the vault 94 as a group raid with unique loot combined with some new weekly challenges in there!! 
---
Now i hope for new named weapons as a loot with unique look and legendary effects as the new meta!! 
---
The most boring part of the game is the end game with the gold bullion farming and the same dailies all the time.. 
---
We need new activities combined with interesting loot..
---
Here’s your violin.
---
y'all need to play on PC. Mods make this game waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better.
---
Honestly the damage part of bloodied isn't even the part I thought needed nerfed. I think unyielding needs nerfed. Getting +15 to every special stat is ridiculous.
---
Um...... Ok
---
It’s something I hope Bethesda will work more to fix. While I think continued play deserves reward, this idea that you have to play a couple hours everyday is detrimental. kids in Scouts, person in the medical field, or anyone else with odd schedules or commitments to be away for a long period of time have no way to make up for it later. 
---
The xp bonus is nice but way too small. Personally I’d prefer do play a larger factor or we just do mostly weeklies with only a couple dailies to encourage people to log on. FOMO can be similar to the same mentality as gaming, while some people are just whiny about it there are others who really have a compulsion issue that makes them feel like they need those rewards. The problem becomes that those people either get overly addicted to the mechanic or burnout completely. Either way becomes detrimental to Bethesda as many games have had PR nightmares lately trying to explain away addictive gaming trends or best case scenario they just lost a customer.
---
It’s just something that could be made more elegant and still achieve the same result.
---
Finally! I can hang a gun on the wall without the ugly workshop background. It looks more natural then the current wall displays.
---
8 down votes for calling them a snitch. 🤣😂🤣
---
I'm not complaining about more or less difficult.  If I want a challenge,  I play nw solo with an auto and semi auto guns. I can't just engage full squads directly, I have strategise,  check what weapons they have. Be alert at all times,  etc.
---
I just disagree the way Bethesda is approaching this weapon thing.
---
holy shit, it's basically a Fixer for 1h melee? That thing would be godly.
---
Sounds good. I support this change. Some build were just too good.
---
And no, this doesn't make enemies more spongy for the sake of prolonging the fights. It just removes the easy mode.
---
This is why you should stop trying to fight with petty weapons and [ascend to the master builder PvP experience ](https://streamable.com/eou107)
---
And as a bonus you can also have double the frustration at the ammo converter :P
---
Wendigo drider!
---
I thought the exact same thing.
---
They could’ve buffed the shit builds but instead they nerfed every damage dealing one to make them worse. That’s like trying to make everyone equal height by chopping off the legs of a 6 foot tall person so he will be 3 feet
---
You’re welcome.
---
Edit clarification: I made the correction after hitting send but this person wanted to make sure I knew I had done something wrong.
---
Isn't that the fog crawler?
---
I’m very excited for the rank 99, I have waited for that since the game was released, and it’s not even all broken.
---
Wait wait wait.... Are you trying to tell me that you ROLE PLAY? What’s wrong with you? /s
---
*you're
---
For my low level alt, medium generator is 3 gears.
---
So 2 generators would be 6 gears.
---
I'm guessing contractor perk might take it off after materials are totaled.
---
The floating orb weavers are far scarier than them being a spider!
---
That’s funny, you don’t look like op
---
Honestly? Not much of a difference to me. I still plow through everything. The only difference is the sbq/colossus taking double digit damage. So that hurts, general playing though? I welcome the challenge
---
I just recently started playing, and it drives me nuts. I have never been low enough to fast travel and I haven't been playing long enough to warrant an alt yet. Maybe I should look into that option.
---
Now I finally have somewhere to spend my 5k gold bullion. Lunchboxes.
---
That explains randomly getting radiation out of nowhere!
---
I legit saw someone being mad that a turret now required 2-3 bullets instead of 1. The absolute state of some..
---
I’m not sure, it definitely works but you can’t be on any teams
---
I hit my dailys most days in 20min, I missed two weeks from being naughty, didn’t get on for the double weekend at all and not bought any ranks and lvl 71 so far. It’s really not an effort.
---
I f*cking screamed as I died to one in that game just seeing a spider way larger than the player running at you is scary. Vr for this game would give me a heart  attack.
---
It doesn't, you spend all 3 gears. More efficient to place 2 gens rather than a blueprint of 2 gens
---
Wow, you gave him a 450 shotgun and fixer.
---
So back to the dust heap basically haha
---
one wasteland yo.. its all getting nerfed
---
&gt;bAlwaysActive = 0
---
This would achieve that. No idea what kind of side-effects you're going to run into, though. Not a tweak I personally use.
---
450 shotgun ammo and a regular fixer
---
*You could kill me... or you could get that level 100 hellfire armor, I know it’s what you desire*
---
Everyday, now that the the run is over for me, I get on, scrip, gold, caps, steel,  lead and acid run. Logoff. It's about 30 min before I go to bed. Sucks it has to be this way but I'll have plenty of resources for the next DLC.
---
I'm glad I quit playing this mess before players finally started being able to hack EACH OTHER.
---
there is only one item related to the brotherhood, and this is indeed in Season 2. [https://i.imgur.com/bui8B96.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/bui8B96.jpeg)  
---
don't mix up ACE and BoS, they can be look similar.
---
What’s the value of a Handmade Rifle with powerful automatic and the 3 perks?
---
Flamer barrel absolutely shreds (ammo also, but it’s worth it)
---
People are salty that their easymode was nerfed and they'd need start paying attention in combat, instead of just oneshotting everything.
---
I suspect that my stealth sniper would be hit somewhat (the stealth multipliers), but I accept this change as needed to tone down the easymode of bloodied. When one build is able to dish out so much damage, it limits the design space. And then we end up with bullshit resterictions like allowing only 8 people to fight the Wendigo Collosus in the new event.
---
The best course of action would be to apply this change, but buff some standards multipliers like weapon perk cards so that normal builds would remain largely unaffected, but Bloodies would get toned down.
---
Bet we just turn in tons of junk
---
at least they're listening 😂
---
Or a level 5 pipe pistol for ranged. It just takes a minimal amount of effort and consideration.
---
Yeah, that makes no sense.
---
Finally getting the PA display stands........ some of the rewards look good to me. The video game and foose ball table look cool and the BOS bunker...
---
JFC, its like this game is managed by chimpanzees.
---
Absolutely not
---
I just got a vamp explosive pump shotgun. If every pellet hits the torso it basically heals me to full in one shot. Lol
---
Bro chill lol
---
Because with the current system most the map becomes obsolete once you level up.
---
i always pick casual team for the +4 luck because i figured that was the most useful in terms of getting decent loot. am i wrong on this?
---
Yup. It's a prefab building. I just watched a video where they went through every reward spot. There's 1 spot for stimpaks, 1 spot for rad-x/away and one spot for nukashine. 
---
So hardly that terrible if those are rewards once. There was also a 5 cards to launch a nuke reward.
---
Oh wow, this is a great idea!!! Yeah, I’m definitely going to invest the time in this, that’s fantastic thinking! 
---
At least you have options, if nothing else! But I think this could very well work. 
---
I was so disappointed when they took vending down a couple months or so ago, because I didn’t realize why they did it (I had just started playing at the time, we all start somewhere lol)- so now that this has happened, I can definitely see why it was such an issue. Some players spend WAY more time on collecting items than I do, so if I can save anyone the heartache, I’m happy to do that. 
---
I don’t know what compels people to do these things. I just want to have a good time, during a pandemic, in my own home, without having my stuff stolen- that’s pretty simple!
---
Kudos to you for offering to help folks with this! Good to see someone help folks grind it out the intended way and not just shortcut through it to get to the control room. Have my upvote nice person!
---
It's possible to solo it with a magic weapon. Otherwise, as you said there's just not enough time for that specific mission
---
Ha ha this is in fact very true.
---
Why this game has insisted on being pretty much the only MMO to not have a respec station/vendor and no bank to transfer items between your characters is baffling. At this point I’m inclined to believe that they are just not capable of implementing these things due to the nature of the core game files/engine/etc. it makes no sense at all that they would intentionally or ignorantly ignore these two core aspects of any MMO unless they just weren’t able to do it.
---
Yeah, but the best places are still the best. People are going to still grind at West Tek, even if the Jail is now a high leveled place. I guess Forest events are better now, but that’s really about it.
---
YOU WILL BE UP GRADED
---
YOU WILL BE COME
---
CYBER-MEN
---
Fantastic work guys.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Thos wolf spiders are one of the scariest things in a game ever, especially when they're silent. I didn't expect it to be a horror game but it absolutely is.
---
With the way things are going so far, it looks like we might be joining you 😓
---
should not have to server hop to complete a quest if some one else did it on same server.  that is bug they have to fix.
---
Check my history.......not really in the duping market.  I also don't bend a knee for a criminal.  Have a good morning bud!
---
Scorpions are bad enough
---
Was he wearing a red power armor? Based on my observation, his shotgun spread is pretty narrow. My best guess is Master Shotgunner + Skeet shooter + grenadier + explosive + frog legs. And the last one is probably bloody mess or fashion finder or tenderizer.
---
If he's not wearing power armor, you could just run very close to him but you and him will get down instantly. Just make sure your non bush camper teammates are nearby. I managed to get a gauss shotgunner down this afternoon but my teammate was AFK.
---
I pull, enter Vats, wait half a second, release. That works.
---
In FO76 they’re in a category I like to call the “Gimmick” Weapons where they look and function quite well but if you really try to think about their use in combat they wouldn’t be all too useful unless they have an absolutely god tier roll.
---
Unless you're an experience player or have somebody to carry you certain parts of the main quest such as the wendigo cave were massively overtuned for the level of the quest resulting in a stop of progression. I like helping out low level players when I can so having more of them in areas I'll be in is a nice change for me. It does suck level 100 enemies don't give a good chunk of experience though.
---
With legendary perks coming it maybe better to start a new character. I know my 
---
Level 480 swapped a few times &amp; it will screw me over legendary perk wise.
---
They never got added to the legendary pool like the dragon. So they added them to the raid to give more reason to run it I guess. With the removal of the raid they became legacy and I imagine they are holding them to be a reward for something in the future.
---
And you've thoroughly tested this?
---
Buff bad builds don’t neuter good ones. Rip Bloodied and Junkies 2019-2020
---
Because im sick of the same few places. I want to explore and loot stuff all around the map. I enjoy just walking around looting everything that isn't nailed down. The low level areas I havent been to for a very long time because I know even if i find a 3 star legendary it will be usless to me no matter how good rhe weapon actually was.
---
Move them to a mule until you need them
---
To be fair, quite a lot of weapons could fall under that category haha
---
Been about 2 months that I've been constantly 200-400 lns over my carry weight. If the vending machine items were set to say, 50% against the storage limit, or a fixed weight per line item, or something that could help restore some sanity.
---
&gt;not an afterthought that can be taken down in fractions of seconds.
---
Oh don't worry, the magic weapons are still quite magical. 😫
---
In the “gimmick” category I’d also place the Chainsaw,Commie Whacker, and the Mr Handy Buzz Blade. I think all those weapons are fun to use but really don’t work well for builds or damage after level 30
---
It's looking like there's new vault 94 stuff on the PTS, maybe they turned them back on for that, I hope so anyway
---
Things I would like to see in regards to stash limits:
---
1. Vendors are a separate stash. Once you put an item on sale it is no longer counted against your regular stash. Could possibly deter future glitches that allow people to steal from someone's stash via the vendors.
---
2. Ammo should be a separate stash with a 200 lb limit or in that area.
---
3. The weight of food and chems are too high. I feel like it's the bobby pin issue part 2  
---
4. eta There's no reason not to make the scrapbox a regular part of the game. Find other ways to make FO1st appealing and just give everyone a scrapbox. It's past time.
---
to be fair, imo, everything besides the "filler" and icons looks great.
---
Nah, that would have been completely arbitrary.  You don't balance things by singling out one stat and saying "Oh, in this case, that doesn't apply anymore."
---
I haven't gotten unique drop yets (only did 1 solo run to Paladin rank) but the 2 legendaries I got from completion were both... I wanna say 3star, and solid rolls to boot! (may just be luck, but hey). Executioner/SS/90RW Super Sledge and something else
---
Buy assaultron recall cards from vendors, can't non stop spam encrypted but they are a good sink
---
😂😂😂 The last 2 points had me laughing
---
Just yesterday I m turned around and a charred floored me in one punch, those little shits never fail to make me jump
---
Wholeheartedly agree!
---
People who really really hated it stopped playing, People who play still don't really mind, especially if they put in the work to get to that endgame build. I don't mind though. to hell with bloodied/junkies meta.
---
As a level 350+ I can't even go to most of those places you've listed, without there being a 50% chance of things being under leveled. We either needed this setup or a complete dismissal of levels all together and no damage multiplier increases with level ups
---
Fair enough. I just think any glitch that gets fixed is a good thing and a step in the right direction.
---
(ADDED) An Ounce of Prevention: Players may get stuck at Collect Blood Samples (0/3)
---
STATUS: This will be addressed in Patch 21.
---
I think he did. 
---
Especially since it’s possible to get infinite caps without using any glitches and through normal gameplay. 
---
People seem to forget the method of ‘make an alt, give them stuff to sell, get the 1400 caps transferred over, delete alt, repeat process’.
---
You can’t do that with gold bullion. You have to be *at least* level 20 to get to the vault raid, and the currency isn’t transferable. 
---
Which makes it far better than caps for a controlled and sustainable currency.
---
Thats really awesome, and credit to Bethesda for implementing something like that.
---
They heard the call. I like everything I see
---
With the fire damage mod on a chainsaw, it makes a decent side weapon even against max level enemies (except scorchbeasts obviously cuz of their fire immunity)
---
Even considering the fact it can't be a higher level than like 30 I believe 
---
It's one of the best options for a sniper character when they get swarmed imo, since it also doesn't require perk cards to do decent damage
---
Yeah I remember juicehead on YouTube discussing how people solved it from when it was initially data mined. It took them only a few days I guess. Still, it's cool to see people get excited to figure it out on their own.
---
Thank you. Even after posting a video link from the BETA timeframe, I still have people arguing with me.
---
In fact, reading through by hat reminded me about some of the other early fixes/changes they made. 
---
Two Hour slowdown from a Cryolator?  I’d forgotten about that!
---
I want to play with the fatman and missile launcher but I can't without slow walking everywhere
---
I know this isn't related too much to the post. But if you enjoy solving puzzles and that I highly recommend the show gravity falls. Each episode starts with a cypher that alludes to something in the future and its really cool to see it peice together
---
This isn't a trophy, so bad opinion
---
Bethesda like taking the fun out the game what's next removing guns
---
Dangit need help with my first, wrong console haha
---
the raider and settler lamps bug like this as well sadly
---
It takes the same amount of bullets to kill a level 50 watoga robot and a level 100 super mutant demolisher, so pretty janky. Level 100 mole miners are still one shot though. we'll see what the serious testers find out about it.
---
Foosball table and Shooting Gallery. Absolutely amazing to me
---
I live in Wheeling. Deathclaw Island is Wheeling Island. Plenty of open area in the north west portion of the map. The game map and its locations are not 100% accurate, but they tried to get things semi close.
---
Toxic valley (Ohio valley) should run north to south not east to west. 
---
The only thing north of Morgantown is Pennsylvania.
---
Both the prison and the winding path are about 20 miles from Wheeling.
---
Yes.
---
Bloodied/Junkie still do more damage than the rest.  But the difference isn't as pronounced.  Instead of damage in the thousands, you're back in the hundreds.
---
The thing is, you get this one-two punch of also having the One Wasteland update, which includes Lv. 75 and Lv. 100 variants of many enemies, and some seem to have the same damage blunt that the Queen does, in addition to a massive HP pool.  And, remember, your weapons are also dealing less damage.  So the end result is an extremely tedious, time-consuming fight that some players will probably forego because it's not worth the resource expenditure.
---
Thanks for share!
---
The only not matching item is the BoS bunker. They have to change the logo to the Power Patrol one, and it is cool.
---
That’s frickin awesome!
---
Kinda wish I wasn’t as salty as I was back then...
---
I didn’t play it originally because it was MMO &amp; not my single player Fallout,&amp; then I was like,eh maybe I should try it,&amp; got double salty because of no NPC’s.
---
Now I play far more then my wife would like me too,Lol
---
honestly, if it just didnt show options to sell ammo i didnt have, it'd be way less tedious to use amd i'd be willing to accept it as-is. but im not gonna keep a mental note of how much of each ammo i have, and im not gonna back out of the terminal to check if i cant remember, so i have to go through every option. and that sucks.
---
Just saw someone using bloodied going through a nuke silo on the PTS.
---
 They where 1 or 2 shooting everything.
---
They also glitched through the doors so they only spent about 30 seconds getting to the final room. Thought bethesda would have fixed that by now.
---
Who even use that thing?
---
West Virginiaaaaaaaaa
---
I have been using a 1 star bloodied 50 cal that is only level 35 for ages waiting for a better max level one to drop for ages.  A random ant dropped a 3 star version for me at scorched earth this morning finally and when I went into the pip boy to check it out...level 25!  Wtf.  Loot dropping at the end game fight that is only half of max level is some bull.
---
Strangler
---
- After 350-400 on resist stats you hit a point of diminishing returns, paired with all PA having a ~42% Reduction(full set) on all damage prior to resist stats make the defence comparison between any PA pretty much meaningless
---
- rad resist # is a useless stat, all PA(full set) has a 90% rad reduction (hazmat/stealth has 99% redux
---
- strangler has an extra (but weak after nerf) set effect boosting its offence, no other PA has bonus effects
---
- an argument could be made that SS mods are easier to obtain (bullion compared to queen drops) but SH and the effect would beat SS out if you get the mods you need/want.
---
This is normal behavior in any online game (MMO, Moba, ARPG...):
---
1. People figure out the build the overperforms everything else
---
2. Many people flock to this build
---
3. It creates many problems with the game People with this build consume content at an alarming rate and then whine that they're done in two days. People using normal builds have trouble competing - they get denied from parties and they have issues playing the game when others oneshot everything. It also limits design space and devs have to create measures that quite often impact normal players just as hard.
---
4. The developer nerfs the amazing build
---
5. People are salty that their easymode got killed and they lost their feeling of superiority.
---
6. People invent excuses why they are entitles to having easymode builds in the game.
---
With my stealth sniper build where the only thing that boosts my damage is Instigating on my hunter rifle, I'm able to one-shot any supermutant in the game. If this average build can breeze through most of the game, then any argument on "bullet sponges" are invalid.
---
If you wanted a challenge, don't be Bloodied.
---
You can still get 1* ripper and dragons from the monster mash reward machine. They're still only a max level of 40 though (the ripper that is, the dragon can be max level)
---
Oh! U want to be able to respec your character? Ok, we at Bethesda will start nerfing TSE weapons right away
---
I reccomend just starting a new character, you can get to level 50 in a couple days once you know what you're doing, maybe even faster 
---
That way you can just swap characters on the fly
---
The one sucky bit is of course you can't share learned plans, what I do is just send all rare plans to my "main" who's mostly a builder/crafter since that's what I enjoy doing the most 
---
And I have my other characters to play different builds to mix up the gameplay while doing events and quests to get rare stuff, which I keep on sending to my main lol
---
\[*The Brotherhood of Steel will remember that*\]
---
*VILIFIED* 
---
*For your overwhelmingly monstrous behavior, you have become vilified by the community.*
---
Dont know what to think of this. The fact that someone actually gives 1 very good example how indeed the world sticks together this days, well formulated and accurate. Get downvoted that much!?? God, hope its not a indication how rotten the world trully is! :-\
---
Battles of attrition aren't really "challenging."  Given enough time, the player *will* win.  The question is whether or not their patience will hold out.
---
I think Chad in Camden park sells what you're looking for.
---
Just feel like other builds could be buffed and bloodied and junkies could be nerfed a tad
---
Only with junkies and 200+ firerate
---
i mean, we have radscorpions. technically still arachnids.
---
Oh shit really? A vampiric one would make me so happy
---
Do you know how much candy it takes?
---
I think what this game needs is a bank.
---
The appeal of the stash is that everything you put into it is available at a moments notice, but that's not nessesarily required for all items. Having a bank system I think would still allow 1st subscribers to retain their advantage of having an unlimited stash, while alieviating a lot of the restriction placed on peasant users total storage.
---
Could even add currency storage, and maybe a cheque system. Item notes akin to the ones in Runescape... Lot's of possibilities.
---
Gold bullion dump everyone has been asking for with those lunchboxes
---
because bethesda is lazy and wont implement several weapons into the loot table. its nothing complicated, just lazy.
---
Yes, it's not something they would add to just to test.
---
I tend to trust posts like yours more, a lot of posts seem to be people just going off data mined figures not actual experience of it
---
I dunno if I could look like a weed all day lol
---
Guess I'll find out soon, I was maxxed out last night
---
I can't be bother with all these challenges. I'm playing at my own pace. why need to get so stress out with it? it's just a game. After a year plus of hiatus from it, i came back because i was burnout in The Division 2 (boring daily grinding chores) and also recently COD: Warzone (skill based match making sucks). They don't offer the casual adventures that Fallout always have. We choose our adventure. Enjoyment is the key. Just play the game the way we wanna play. all will reach to the end game subsequently and some if not most of us just wanna fool around in alternate reality of Fallout 76 to our real daily life.
---
I think that the ammo machine production rates definitely deserve a second look as a result of this.  There's no reason why that thing spits out 5.56 like no tomorrow, but struggles on things like .45 or Fusion Cells.
---
I'm also curious where exactly we're supposed to stash all of this enemy-specific gear.  The reason why people go Bloodied or Junkie is because it's kind of a build for all seasons, no matter what you're facing, in a game where inventory is heavily constrained.  But if it turns out, especially for Daily Ops, that Slayer gear is something useful to have on standby, where is that supposed to go?
---
Alright fair enough it's not the best but as items with actual gameplay value (including the chicken coop) it'd be nuts if future players just had no way to get them.
---
God.  No. Nope. And o look nope.
---
&gt;unlimited stash
---
Definately not, unlimited junk stash is already pushing the limit of pay to win.
---
It would be the Bethesda thing to do. Either delay it to 2021 and then make out like they were doing us a favour by doing so or rush the release broken and then take a couple of months to fix it anyhow.
---
I am 212 now. I have 140 levels saved....
---
I mean it's not like I have low ammo issues already haha
---
Haha I dunno if it's laziness per se, they probably just haven't noticed since it's an obscure weapon and all
---
Wondering about this too, stashed all my IE and TSE weapons on another character just in case. Instigating fast firing weapons may be viable.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/S.M.A.R.T._choice_machine
---
Pistols in F76 - weakest weapon. And most hard to play. Do you still want to play with em?
---
Yeah, it is simple--to just have a good time.  :)   Preferably without having to deal with thieves.
---
It was my solution to taking things in and out of stash/inventory because of exploits, bugs, and cap limits.  The other solution versus a locked door....which people can easily pick....is just replace that entire door/wall with just a flat-out wall.   It only takes a second.
---
Are you serious? The ammo converter is amazing. After uranium fever, line in the sand, or just a west tek run you can get upwards of 1k steel. Convert that to railway spikes and you'll come out with close to 700 (can be way more depending on event) and then that can become several thousand of whatever round you like. I can just throw out all of that super heavy gunpowder now! No more mining runs for lead! It's amazing.
---
Here’s the issue with this video- on the top left corner of the screen, you have a clearly identifiable player name who is purchasing my items, I open my pip-boy to check my caps, I am at 3047 caps, and as this person continues to purchase, you can see, just as you normally would, their name continuously popping up on the left, yet in the middle of your screen where your cap animation adds up (unless it’s stuck, sometimes I find that happens, which is why I checked my pip-boy), there is no animation, and my caps did not increase in the slightest, one of my items was priced at 500 caps, my ammo is typically at 1 cap- regardless, no dice on compensation. And I left the server, closed my entire application. 
---
My last post about this was taken down because I was very vocal about their names (this was my first reddit post, I didn’t realize witch-hunting was in the guidelines, until that post). That being said, as annoying as it is to see that one hater (not you) on a post clearly being discussed by many who are having this similar disheartening issue, posting that will just have the video and the entire post taken down. 
---
I don’t know anything about a previous rumor, I’m sorry. All I am aware of is what happened to me, what could happen to you, and has happened to seemingly many. My intention for this post was to find a solution, get insight on how to contact Bethesda further because I have been ignored, and has instead become an awareness post. It is your choice to take it as a warning or not, the chances of it happening to you are hopefully slim but I have no clue how it works behind the scenes, hence why I’m here. 
---
Best of luck to you, there may be YouTube videos with further information, maybe even reverse engineering to do it yourself, I’m just trying to finish my legendary run.
---
I feel like people should not have to rely on alts. I have considered doing so but it just feels wrong to do.
---
And there kids is the Raider in the room. 😀
---
Neeed help on Xbox :( for my first one
---
That's also what's most important for me, I just loved the lunchbox openings at the end of events and such and now you don't need to feel as bad because you can actually get more on demand, especially for those late-game who already got a lot of the gold bullion plans and are stockpiling bullion
---
I mean that kind of is the only way to get these weapons if we exclude random luck or duping really.
---
Yessss
---
Thanks man, I was just about to check there, sorry I bothered you with asking lol
---
 it's not like I didn't know where to look up that info haha
---
There are no sound files (mp3, wav...), as far as I know all music and sound effects are embedded into .ba2 files in the data folder. There is probably some way to extract them, but I never looked into that.
---
As for your sound problem, sorry, can't think of any other fixes at the moment. If you can borrow an external usb sound card (a cheap one would do, they start at \~8-9$/€) from someone for a test it might help to verify if it is your (onboard?) sound card or a windows/game related issue.
---
Maybe post in the steam or bethesda tech support forum, or send a support ticket?
---
Wendigo are the creepy enemy of the game, specially when they Jump off from tree in the mire
---
Yep, a &gt;!Cyberman !&lt;with a little of &gt;!"Are you my mommy?"!&lt; on top.
---
Im getting my Jangles backpack today. I like some of the rewards from season 2 but I cant see myself committing like this again. If its the same bs timegating I am just doing them when I play and I go as far as I go.
---
Pipe is life
---
They can make it look at base Luck, like how perk sharing looks at base charisma now
---
I used to love to run shotguns, now all these idiots going shotgun for an overpowered peice of garbage irritate me because of how everyone reacts to "I'm a shotgun build" now.
---
Anyway, master shotgunner, skeet shooter, bloody mess, tenderizer, explosives damage card, frog legs, fill card (most people say grenadier, but I notice next to no change with the weapon)
---
&gt;My pipe revolver went from headshotting a lv68 super mutant for 3400 damage to 521 on a lv100.
---
I think there's something going on with the Lv. 100 variants where they have a damage blunting buff like the SBQ does.
---
Which, as it does on the Queen, just looks broken, imo.  If they want a beefier enemy, give them an appropriate amount of extra HP.  Don't do something that makes the player's damage numbers look arbitrarily ineffective.
---
So to clarify, even if you didn't reach the goals in the legendary run, you can acquire the plans? That makes me happy, I really wanted the chicken coop :D
---
„Knarrenheinz, is that you?“
---
Well when I say should not have, I mean players do not need.
---
I enjoy having a bulk of junk that I can always access, but I have over 3000lbs of junk, they should make junk weigh less when put in to a players stash, or have things like C.A.M.P perks or something.
---
It certainly feels unfair to those players who play without it.
---
How hard are these ops? I have heard of exploding enemies, enemies that freeze you, see you even if in stealth, never stops respawning and more. Is it another Vault raid scenario?
---
LOL
---
the appalachian enclave is dead. its just MODUS, some robots, and a random vault dweller now.
---
I am shotgun build and, single shot rifles on another. I've never played pistols but, I have seen a lack of love for snipers in almost all games and, for some reason shotguns in this game are only good if you have a Gauss shotgun. I love my double barrel.
---
Very well rested for 25% xp boost per lunch box (up to 100%) for 1 hour...also check your pip boy under effects
---
&gt;your stupid ammo generator will have made 200 bullets by the time you get back from SBQ.
---
I see someone runs with 5.56 ammo.
---
News flash: the production rates of certain ammo types are significantly higher than others.  When I did the Legendary Run, I basically had to switch to a 5.56 weapon to remain somewhat ammo neutral.  Didn't have a prayer with a .45 weapon.  This felt completely arbitrary, because it was.
---
It's just like in real life yo haha
---
I bet you were the kid that asked the teacher if we had homework right before the bell rings.
---
Bethesda only gave people the tools. Some people decided to be assholes.
---
True men understand each other without words. they just grunt. ;)
---
Think there are far many other real problems with the game that need fixing. But I know where you coming from.
---
Nice
---
Ah thanks
---
On the pts damage has been nerfed
---
Rad kit is the only thing that irked me. Greenhouse set...I like that idea. Bunker floor and walls. Yes please. The ship in the bottle is favorite decoration
---
Use escape to get out of it.
---
Lunchboxes for gold is great
---
I'm afraid to try mods. I worry that I'll get the wrong one and it will earn me a ban or mess up my game. Am I overthinking this?
---
I know, i say that in the post...
---
Had that too a few days ago.
---
The guy even kept following me and wasting mag after mag. I got pacifist mode on so nothing happend but maaaan was he mad
---
one wasteland yo.. its what "everybody" wanted...
---
now you can enjoy the whole map with your pals no matter what level..
---
el oh fucking el...
---
That is how it is, I sell everything for dirt cheap and when I am hitting the Scrip or Caps limit I get forced to spend it and then the cycle continues where I have way too many items.
---
Sounds like ZA's good ol' loadshedding!
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but wouldn't the nerfs have zero effect on non legendary weapons and non damaging perks?
---
With at least some armor penetration perks and mods, maybe some firerate, it shouldn't be that bad
---
I've had to play with normal weapons whenever my legendaries break while exploring and it was alright
---
Edit - are the downvotes because I'm wrong or are people just salty lol
---
Really worried about this going live.
---
Having little experience in this arena amongst many seasoned players, I was unsure of what to expect, but will now be taking further precautions as this seems to happen every now and again in various ways. 
---
I will definitely take your suggestions, this is the best approach I may have gotten thus far, as all you can really do it suck it up and move on- and just server hop next time haha 
---
Thank you so much for your input!
---
No prob, also here’s a link to a page that lists all the possible effects you can get in addition to the xp boost: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Lunchbox_(Fallout_76)
---
I never thought to use steel to make spikes and then convert the spikes. That is genius
---
13 items that seem great for me.  I've reached the point in game play where my CAMP is more important though as I have done it all at least twice now and aside from 1 SS piece I have everything I have been after.   
---
As for your "fancy" comment that is subjective, to me the arcade shooter is pretty fucking fancy same with the foosball table.  Though I am a glutton for interactables.
---
You have to hold the back button, or tab on PC
---
Should be B on Xbox controllers, and circle on ps4
---
No. No. No no no no no no no.
---
The legendary prefix doesn't matter if it has +50% crippling limb damage. But fire rate +200 is required, yeah.
---
Wondering the same. I've seen some posts it was nerfed in patch 1.0.6 to not provide any damage boost until below 60% health now and the full 50% boost at 10% health. Wondering if that is true or its still spread out starting at 89% health. It's still useful but less so if it doesn't start until 60% now since i'm not brave enough to run bloodied.  This might not even matter since it appears they are again changing damage calculations according to the test server. Sounding like at least bloodied is getting a major nerf from current testing.
---
Here is a link to the PTS notes with the damage changes mentioned in it  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i9skcc/new\_features\_in\_the\_pts\_81420/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i9skcc/new_features_in_the_pts_81420/)
---
If it is not junk, it is weapons and armor that people sell in their stores that take up all the room.
---
I hadn't even thought about that.
---
Due to RSI I play most games with a controller plugged in so the button prompts are all related to that.
---
I'll give that a pop next time!
---
One wasteland is fine, if it works, but it is too much. Shouldn't be scaling up this much.
---
I'll try for holding the button down next time. Thanks.
---
It still feels very unintuitive!
---
Great way to use luck and charisma I'm honestly let's be real does anyone even do PVP on adventures? We have Battle Royal now so all we have to do is get rid of the PVP adventure and replace it with casinos.
---
Personally, I enjoy the game having to choose what fights to fight, and what to run from. I’d say I’m mostly a lucky V.AT.S. build. I use a “magic shotgun” and it takes two shells for many enemies but is useless on large enemies unless I’m very close and completely useless on mirklurk Queen. Then I mostly use anti armor legendary 10mm sub with vats  low usage. I don’t know these bloodied and junkie builds always seemed like they’d take all the challenge out of the game.
---
I'm all for, "this reload time is exhilarating!" I would love a lever action modded to be a pistol. I've always wanted the short barrel short stock hunting rifle to count as a pistol but, a small increase to firing speed to make up for the range loss.
---
Win what? I don't understand the advantage, other than to enjoyability.
---
PvP is barely a part of the game anymore, and regardless, having an unlimited stash or the current scrap box don't seem to be able to affect a PvP battle.
---
PvP outcome, as far as I can tell, is still completely dependent on level, equipment, build, and aim/reflexes, probably in that order.
---
Not really. Pretty much any weapon that is being sold traded that is ultra rare or legacy is duped, why? Becuase you have to ask yourself why would the person be getting rid of it? Why are so many people getting rid of it and where did they all get their hands on it? 
---
Now I'm not condoning duping in any form but people who buy these weapons would be better off duping their own or find players who are duping. It's really not that hard. Streamers can't help themselves as they need the views/likes for thier channels so they will churn out any info they can, including dupe methods. When people buy these weapons they are setting a demand, showing the dupers that people will buy them, which leads to people duping more.
---
So if you think about it people who buy dupe weapons are not that much different to people who dupe. Therefore everyone should dupe one item they really really want. Again I'm not condoning duping but doing so will slow the demand for duped stuff and overall calm things down.
---
good on you for not putting your actual camp in the street..
---
if your circle is in the street tho.. you should move it so its not IMO
---
On the contrary, if it'll stop people from 1-shotting every legendary in sight, then fucking bring it on.
---
Starting in 2 hours ish
---
Sounds like my high health build was the way to go...
---
Sheepsquatch don't really have claws though 
---
They do have those weird spikes, maybe a weapon incorporating that would be cool
---
I feel like the sheepsquatch mace looking weapon with the horns used to bludgeon things with already is an awesome way to weaponize them atm though haha 
---
I would rather a hermit crab skin for the deathclaw gauntlet that gives me lobster hands
---
Nononono, the issue is that during leveling, it is WAAAY more than 2-3 hits.
---
Oh I had my times mixed up.
---
Not entirely (I haven’t heard of anyone getting banned, but people occasionally get messed up configs).
---
But I’ve  been running a few essentials basically since the game launched, and I couldn’t live without them. Better inventory, perk loadout manager... save everything, better health bar...
---
It feels unintuitive until it doesn't haha
---
I guess I've gotten used to it
---
What is the best location to obtain a power fist?
---
you don't get something for completing the challenges? that would be the trophy. not sure how you're seeing it but free to disagree
---
Bloodied is still going to be the best build, they didn't nerf it directly, they just nerfed damage across the board.
---
I think they should add a skin for the Deathclaw Gauntlet. But also add a weapon for a Sheepsquatch Gauntlet as well. Maybe it's covered in quills, does poison damage as a mod. 
---
Though what would a Deathclaw Gauntlet skin look like?
---
Nope I placed it by the tree so the camp limit just barely reached the road.
---
I make a point of only having one type of outfit just for the sake of collecting and things like one of each Nuka Cola. Everything else I normally often purge such as spare ammo, aid items. My stash is mostly full of legendaries that I sell for dirt cheap.
---
It's that but mostly because of private healthcare firms backed by the government. They can charge exorbitant prices because the lower income family with government healthcare (Obamacare, medicare ect) will ALWAYS pay the asking price without question. It's basically a government handout with extra steps. There's no market influence to drive prices up or down, because as long as government healthcare pays a 16k dollar hospital, they can keep raising the prices
---
You are a genius. I now have a reason to put the converter back in my camp.
---
What impressed me is how you managed to capture the smell of a real comic book store.
---
That kind of bugs me as well.
---
Smart.
---
It won't be the best build, it'll be the highest dps build 
---
That's a pretty good change imo
---
You should post this over in the Falloutsettlements forum. They'd love it.
---
upvoted for sheepsquatch gauntlet firing quills and regrowing them like the needler from Halo
---
Thought it was "Papa Romeo" if using standard US Army phonetics? I understand some LEO's use different signs, but lore wise I'm pretty sure they have already used "Romeo" a lot in various transmissions and recordings.
---
Source: OIF/OEF vet
---
Completely agree. A rifle should weigh 6-8 lbs.
---
The vendor in Camden Park sells a clean version. There might be one in Garrahan Mining hq too.
---
The trick is to make your traps so obviously traps that they just assume you're an idiot
---
They are correct but it also lowers their guard
---
I don’t recall anything about them murdering farmers for food, unless your talking about 4s brotherhood which is both different and as said many times teagon was not authorized to tell you by any means, he even tells you it’s off the books, he’s a evil slimball that dosent represent the brotherhoods interest
---
Which is fine by me. I invested in Quad....so I’ll do just fine with my Q2525 Handmades and Plasma Rifles
---
Fair enough
---
Yes, I haven't got to the chicken coop yet and the plans are available for me to buy.
---
Because they paid $17.99 (plus shipping and handling) for their weapons on a market site to be able to one shot Legendary Mole Miners in Uranium Fever
---
Removing the food debuff is going to reduce the need for food unless you are a food build.  Ammo boxes sound great.
---
We both know they wont scale anything
---
The thing I want most of all is the [FNV Power Fist skin](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power_fist_(Fallout:_New_Vegas)), but the [Fallout 3 Deathclaw Gauntlet skin](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Deathclaw_gauntlet_(Fallout_3)) would be cool too.
---
I also really want the [Railroad Armored Coat](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Railroad_armored_coat) to be added, considering the Blueridge Caravan Outfit is just a recolour of it. There was different recolour of it in the datamine of patch 21 so I'm kinda holding my breath for it
---
Hold down the back button on the controller, does the same thing.  Instantly exits out of any terminal you use.
---
Yeah that’s exactly what needs to happen!
---
At level 360, I want to grind levels at Poseidon Energy or Wavy Willards. Seriously. I like going to Westek, but at lower levels these were some of my favorite locations to visit... just not for xp.
---
Well the Wendigo Colossus is the closest we are going to get.
---
What’s to stop people from adding erroneous data, either to simply be malicious or attempt to alter the value of items for their own benefit?  I understand that a couple values on the far ends of a bell curve are outliers, but if a large discord group makes a concerted effort, I could see values being skewed.
---
I’m not disparaging your efforts, just curious if you have ways to combat this sort of thing.
---
They can really do anything with an animal theme for it. Look at Stanley which is a mod for grognaks axe.
---
Those power fists from fallout 1, 2, and new Vegas with the built in shotguns in the knuckles would also be cool lol
---
\+1
---
Yep. This sounds fishy. Too many people have a hateboner for Bethesda and in the past have tried to sabotage their games. Until a video proves this exists, I'll consider it as another such attempt. 
---
What is also suspicious is that this is the first report of this exploit, yet suddenly we have several people "confirming" that this happened to them few days ago. Where are the threads about this exploits from that time, huh?
---
Damn, I’m impressed you managed to fill up a couple magazine racks and still have space left to build the building and whatnot.
---
(Seriously, magazine racks take up so much space when you fill them up. I was able to build a second floor to my house after I did away with a full rack one time... It’s pretty dumb.)
---
I haven't got the chicken coop so makes sense that's not unlocked. As for the ammo converter, the score reward unlocks the item not a plan for the item so I guess the plan doesn't come up as learned.
---
Personally I'm more a fan of pazaak
---
Lucky 8 ball isn’t in new Vegas tho
---
They do and they don't if you look at the wiki picture you can see they have wider talons
---
In all fairness I was a fan of being given the Repair Kits, they were quite convenient.
---
The problem with this game is that unless you plan on wasting an insane amount of ammo you can't really use anything that isn't a BE, AE or TSE anyway and you usually obtain these by trading other similar gear (Which you won't have unless you get incredibly lucky) or again by just buying them really. 
---
For real the only actual OP weapon I got without trading so far has been an AE lever action and i've been basically playing Fallout 76 from the beginning too, people that aren't as lucky and haven't been playing for so long are basically fucked unless they have some friends that can lend them stuff really.
---
This isn’t one wasteland
---
And the greenhouse stuff.
---
Ever heard the inflatable snowman? (Hehehehehe-heeeee) is what is sounds like in a high pitched laugh.
---
I thought they were gonna put them in the atom shop.
---
Communism.
---
I kind of stopped, not because of inventory management but because I don't have a reason to play due to it. In other Bethesda Fallout games just getting stuff (even if meaningless) and storing it was fun so I did that a lot. Those games were basically "Wasteland Recycling Plant Simulators" for me.
---
Let’s say it does 5% of damage dealt.
---
A Vampire’s super sledge healing 500 damage? Not acceptable, because that would make vampires useful!
---
Yep I don't know why they take up so much camp budget, I still have about 10% free camp budget though so I'll be filling in some gaps when I find more magazines.
---
Stackable items like most junk has no impact on stability.  Having 1 steel or 40000000000000000000 steel has the same impact on the server because for the server it is only tracking “steel = x”.  When it is tracking 50 different items with individual paints, stats, builds, and conditions that is when it strains stability and causes lag ir when there are many separate items to track eg each inert bomb or copy if a key gets tracked as individual items.
---
If you doubt this try picking up 100 articles of clothing and see how much more lag you have under apparel.
---
Why anyone would trade with a stranger is beyond me
---
Yeah I do that as well. Currently rping a dweller that joins the Army, progresses to Army Ranger, then joins Taggerdys Thunder.
---
Sheeps have hooves not talons...
---
I largely reject the camp system but I'll start looking into it.
---
That 100%. So many people just say go t65 it has the best stats! When the difference is about nothing with the damage you actually take
---
Yeah. Lesson learned I guess.
---
Bear in mind One Wasteland isn’t about improving the game or introducing a new mechanic, it’s about making the game more accessible to assist word of mouth recommendations and FOMO type marketing. It’s to shift copies of the game. They used the same technique with ESO
---
Pipe...
---
You've hit the nail on the head there. It isn't so much that guns are so rare it's more that people hoard them and sell them online for best prices (understandable I suppose, but not for me). It's a problem that isn't just unique to Fallout, pretty much all online games are like it now such as Destiny with paid Sherpas ect. Everyone wants to make a living from staying home and playing games. 
---
You hear people bang on about the community in games but for me it's always 2 sided, on one hand you have the community who like to give things, drop things help and guide others then you have the o there side of the community who like to hoard all the stuff, get good and then charge for their expertise.
---
It's hard to tell whats where when you play TTWL for thousands of hours.
---
Yeah it’s one thing to freak out at live but this is pretty clear cut on what they’re trying to do and they’re seeing if this fixes some of the calculation issue related bugs.
---
Likely going to see the modifier values edited before they come to live
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Sheepsquatch, based on this image they don't have hoofs
---
As someone that hunts (hunted it has been 3 years now) with a bow I can tell you that is not realistic. Yes you want to have full draw for maximum power but realistic is you have tension and let go that arrow is flying even if only one foot.  I use half draw often when keeping pace with my kids when they are practicing in the backyard.    
---
Though I would never expect Bethesda to have physics that work correctly they could at least revert this change.
---
I really don't mind it too much I am just a bit scared for melee and especially unarmed as you stack a lot of different small modifiers from aid and strength to get your damage, and if you need more than a few hits for things like scorched beasts it will be increasingly annoying as you need to wait for them to land, with normal mobs it would just make you that much more vulnerable, so ranged weapons just become that much more powerful in comparison.
---
And the thing why people are scared for bullet sponges is because with one-wasteland creatures are supposed to spawn at higher levels, all that does is increase health, with a simultaneous damage reduction that could just be tedious and less fun instead of actually harder as most people want it, the collossal problem event was a good start for harder bosses that aren't only bullet sponges as it has many interesting mechanics but this just goes against the sentiment, it\`s like saying "you die more often, so i's harder and more thrilling, right?" that is in fact not the case
---
Rename it, so you don't scrip it.
---
This isn’t one wasteland lol
---
This was for the calculation bugs
---
It is an expression...
---
Paying to have an unfair advantage over other players, especially in a full priced AAA game.
---
You're saying people who literally can't play certain days shouldn't have a fair shot at completing it? Nice argument.
---
That\`s just because each pellet does the heal effect. Having it scale with damage would be much better because all weapons would be equally as viable whether they are high rof or high dmg/hit
---
I’ve just done 2x2 runs for science. More testing will be needed. 
---
1st run, stage one, 5 blooms, stage 2, only 3 blooms, two of which weren’t in the same location as those in stage 1
---
2 run, stage 1, 3 blooms. Stage 2, 4 blooms 2 of which were in the same location as stage 1, one of the ones that were in the same location couldn’t be picked for some reason. 
---
Conclusion, there is absolutely at least 7 locations where they will spawn (possibly 8, but I’m not confident on that) on this limited testing, only 5 blooms so far at any one time.
---
As mentioned, more testing needed.
---
Edit to add. Just got a solid 8th and 9th location. 
---
Only 3 bloomed on this run, one vanished just before picking with both characters (it had been previously picked by both on earlier runs)
---
once you finish the chain quest related to nukashine you will learn the recipe to craft it (and unlock a daily that gives you recipes for other drinks). Is pretty cheap to craft, I always have my nuka cola vending machine full of nukashine for people who visit me and wants to take a trip.
---
Hemlock holes could be made into a mini-golf area. Watch out for that radioactive cesspool... and that one, and that one, and that one...
---
&gt;You've hit the nail on the head there. It isn't so much that guns are so rare
---
I mean guns are definitely very rare in this game if you are talking about getting them through legit means, it's the immense amount of duping over the years that has made OP weapons relatively common really.
---
I've been saying this since 76 came out. Also we should be able to play the board games in fallout.
---
You got too much time. end this here.
---
Yeah and that mindset leads to cheat, and not everyone is OK with that as People want to one shot kill everything, while some want a challenging game
---
I for example am un happy with a 20 scds endgame boss fight that requures literally 0 skill
---
I'm using an unstoppable monster so it's already renamed
---
it's not bloodied, it's the way bethesda changed the way perk cards and buffs works...  
---
 "Additional Changes Combat  Bonus Damage: We’ve made adjustments to the way damage bonuses are calculated to make the resulting damage from multiple buffs more predictable and allow future improvements. This may result in some changes in damage output for some combinations of buffs. "
---
Ooh very nice, glad they made some of this stuff available after the run. Lunchboxes too, I would have settled for them being an actual useful utility item on the atomic shop but this is way better.
---
Now if only they made skins like dark matter and blood eagle and whatnot available in some way too.
---
As a FNV vet I may have a few somewhere...
---
If I didn't scrap them all
---
enemies didnt get harder we will just waste more bullets on them aka only thing that changes is that we will need to waste more time grinding ammo
---
Or some caravan
---
It did. It just didn't show in the pip boy
---
No.
---
Please, give us a mutants buff.
---
I like the idea but the price seems ludicrous.
---
I also assume these plans are per character?
---
I really hope they adjust limits on gold acquisition. It taking weeks to have a good amount and there being so much to spend, it’s very tiresome
---
I am mostly worried for melee to be entirely honest, melee just needs the damage advantage to justify the disadvantages that come with close range (and ammo isn't really an argument imo as it is really easy to get)
---
And if you can't kill a Scorched beast with its first landing it just becomes frustrating and annoying, not harder.
---
I had a knife character. It was my favorite build. I have 55 unique swing speed knives. I would choose a random prefix and knife each day and run with that one. The new nerf wiped the character off the map. Each knife does 1/2 to 1/3 its original damage. The strongest one, BSSS Combat Knife, is the only “viable” knife and it does about the same as my nocturnal knife did during the day
---
i worry it will make my medic commando useless.  I already don’t do great damage with him.
---
Is there a subreddit for FO76 Life Pro Tips?
---
Hell I run around with a nearly unbounded minigun (it's a mutant slayer legendary, only buff to damage it has)
---
My biggest challenge is stopping my shooting quick enough so I dont waste ammo, because everything just dies.
---
Assaultrons and scorchbeasts are the only real common "threat". Assaultrons are cute and thin so a lot of bullets miss; scorchbeasts just have a lot of HP.
---
Both still die in less than a full magazine.
---
big event bosses are the only thing really capable of killing me during normal play, and it's kinda sad sometimes :/
---
It's really fun if you spend a while in a workshop making different blueprints for different NW situations
---
I really thought he must be sarcastic 2, untill i read his response!
---
coherent is an actual word I am kind of confused, am I missing a joke?
---
In an attempt to create challenge and combat the bloody vats commando meta, they’ve made Daily Ops very difficult for that particular play style.  
---
Stealth builds in general are poorly suited for Daily Ops, at least from my limited experience.  Bloody unarmed is more or less useless, even with ridiculously high stealth ability, secret service DR and % based defensive perks like Serendipity, Blocker, Dodgy, etc.  Danger/frozen/dead/repeat.
---
Without sneak attack multipliers, riflemen and commandos are pretty weak.
---
I was hoping they would do that that way, having a "late comer" option is always nice especially with an unique utility item like the ammo converter.
---
It does not only show up in the pip boy it also doesnt show up in damage numbers displayed when hitting enemies. So unless it magically works like tenderizer and is only recognized on the other side I cannot say that it ever worked. Is there a video or proof in like a pvp test?
---
But it also creates a huge atmosphere of FOMO and requirement to play everyday and all content lest you miss something.  The game company may like that, but players don't generally.
---
Eh I’m stopping at handmade skin probably. Not sure yet
---
Because virtually every weapon sucks and it’s much worse than everyone thinks. Especially now that enemies are being buffed.  And they’re not fixing magic weapons either so everyone’s gonna be wanting those instead. It’ll also lead to a huge ammo crisis and grinding for even the most basic things like ammo and aid.
---
convenient during the lowest levels maybe, because we don‘t already get three even better repair kits each time we kill a queen. those repair kits were definitely needed, yeah.
---
&gt; Here’s the issue with this video- on the top left corner of the screen, you have a clearly identifiable player name who is purchasing my items,
---
You can put a watermark over it?
---
Hah yeah, if that gets fixed you wouldn’t have any nuke zones to enjoy.
---
Everyone, Buth in my case it was one-time only!
---
If you still have fixer plans to give, would love them to help finish my character
---
Worse is when you spot the Legendary, use the “come hither” emote and the next guys one shots it. He then runs away and the others turn up and assume you did it. Lots of confused emotes. It’s happened to me a couple of times now. We really need a “it was that twat” emote.
---
Melee weapons are devastated and are the hardest hit. Just saying
---
If you’d taken the time to read my post, you’d see that I updated it with that info.
---
Ooh I know of Wheeling Island! I used to pass through there on my way to doctors appointments in West Virginia once a week.
---
Honestly it’s a real sh*t hole, It’s the only place besides Columba’s Ohio that I feel like we’re actually gonna get robbed if we stay there too long. Even saw a drug deal go down right in front of the school... A few feet away from the sign that says no drug deals on school grounds. It was funny.
---
If they ever fix it they need to give us a key to bypass all the crap after we do the run officially so many times.  Maybe something to grind for the enclave. Not being able to speed run a silo would ruin endgame content as less people would invest the time to launch nukes for queens and wendigo.
---
People wanted a gold bullion dump? How have they already bought everything?
---
I agree but man I have been used to magic guns since November 2018.  The only gun that has never been magical is rifles (which is why the whine from most people).  Also it is fun to come in late see the queen near full health and a group struggle as I pull out my B25 LMG while having magic armor on and killing her in what feels an instant.   
---
I mean literally they have had since BETA to fix the magic guns. At various points they would fix either a gun itself or the methodology but it has always been there and the more they try and fix the rubber banding issue the stronger the magic gets. If I didn't delete it I have a video where it took me 15 seconds to kill the queen back in Jan 2019 with a magic 50 cal.
---
If you have perks that stack damage multiplicatively, your gonna get hit.  Even though most of my weapons are not junkies yet, my non junkies damage is gonna get hit by about 25 percent if my math is correct.  It's just an across the board hit.
---
Bloodied is getting hit the hardest, but will still be enough to get most one shots I presume.
---
Hey man I'm sorry I totally forgot!! I can jump on later today and give them to you if you wanna send me your PSN.
---
But ideally I like the idea of a white one which is why I suggested the sheepsquatch. Albino could be cool for it though
---
I would not mind one iota if they kept doing this or even added the cosmetics to shop bundles down the line. Still got cool free shit
---
I also disagree because it’s easy to do and free, making almost everyone have this stuff
---
We get to do it all over again for the same rewards with season two. Another game board with useless skins. I wonder how many of them will be broken.
---
It’s morning for me, I’ll hop on and check I was maxed like 6 hours ago
---
Only amno I use is 308. I converted 10,000 5mil into something like 700 308 so I dont think this is going to help me out to much but I'm going to try
---
I run a minigun; If theres a horde running at me, imma hose them down.
---
If the notification for an enemy mutating pops up I'll try to slow down and pick my shots; but it dont always pop up
---
LUNCHBOXES FOR BULLION?!?
---
Please tell how much! Forget the plans, I want the lunches lol
---
Well only SS can be Vanguard or Unyeilding or anything else.  Strangler is only poison not legendary but needs modules and vault steel. I went with strangler on second char and hard regretted it.
---
posts voicing reason such as yours get downvoted to the nether, posts defending disingenuous business practices get upvoted to the point of earning awards.
---
'just don't play it bro lol'
---
ain't an excuse. some people in this sub need to get their head checked.
---
Pduch70 is my psn and fo name. And no worries, haven't been on lately either,damn work sucks
---
I agree, after the fix it's become my favorite weapon skin. Regular gatling was ok but even after the fix to the sight aiming it was still kinda blocked if you used the drum mag, the new skin doesn't have that issue.
---
Honestly in my opinion it’s good that they did this. Junkie and bloodied builds are overrated and part of the reason no one PVP’s.
---
Everything they want. I'm personally buying plans just to have them currently (like I'm not a PA user but I'm starting to buy the PA plans to not hit max gold bullion and lose it)
---
Also, you dont need to buy every mod for guns, just the ones your gonna use
---
Thats what i was saying, but gor downvoted for it.
---
Honestly the best skin they could do for that death claw gauntlet is add the Mantis Gauntlet as a skin for it. Real easy to do to say the Brotherhood brought it over from Vegas to
---
Same, im barely lvl 32 on score and I just realized levels get longer...
---
I'll make my own casino, with blackjack and hookers.
---
Most likely. I kept my build very straightforward, with minimal reliance on stacking, if any at all....yet I can still solo Encryptid and stand toe to toe with the Queen until she’s dead.
---
I’ve made it to level 538, I’ll be just fine.
---
I do not mind the filler, but the cosmetic rewards are quite good for those that do like them.
---
You should have mule characters just like any other game. One with weapon weight reducing gear and perks( I also keep my extra armor on this one because there is plenty of room), one for  aid items. I have mule just for flux components because masses weigh too much.your only limit is your own creativity. And I guess social circle bc it takes a friend to transfer items.
---
Your right that it won’t affect your weapon as long as you don’t use any buffs or perks that affect damage in any way.
---
Most people don’t have the IQ to process what is actually being affected.
---
Anti armor legendary, armor piercing are much better now along with TS and instigating.
---
Yeah maybe or as I said in a comment above do OK ne based on the albino deathclaw
---
I know you're not a sock puppet account but you do a great job at passing for one.
---
Yeah ss is cheaper and seems less of a hassle and also I’m not down to be grinding for the mats.
---
Are the daily ops instanced?
---
Uhhhh... i guess go play in the wendigo cavern? Or nuked zone? I think thats the closest you will get to a dungeon experience right now
---
Anything camp related is great :)
---
The only downside to SS is trying to get the pieces you really want sometimes takes forever but at least you're only buying modules not Vault Steel as well and to pay that much and not even be able to have it as unyielding was a deal-breaker for me. I crafted the torso that was it .
---
This really isn't a bad thing, crucify me if you want. It was extremely boring killing everything in the game besides a few of the boss type enemies in only a few hits. I haven't even carried stimpacks on me to do anything but fight SBQ or imposter squatch in almost a year because the game is so goddamn easy with junkies and bloodied. Hell, even without those its like playing any of the other fallout games on very easy
---
Maybe you reassigned the key for ptt to another function?
---
Yes but that’s a legacy weapon and virtually no one has it. Plus if you have demolitions expert that’s getting a nerf.
---
I would say overall, the atom store assets are better for season2 than 1.
---
Then you’re not even seeing what is actually happening?
---
I’ve been trying to do comparisons with my full-health junkie’s melee build, and... There’s more going on. I’m having a hard time pinning numbers down because I swear they KEEP CHANGING (I’m running Live and PTS dual client), but unarmed took a HUGE hit. 1h took a small hit. And as best as I can tell, 2h is actually... the same. 
---
I’m guessing they did something to affect scaling of damage for 2h weapons differently than 1h, but damn...
---
Also energy damage is like 40% of what it was, at least for my melee weapons that have energy components.
---
Does it still break?
---
be careful.. you might get what you wish for...
---
Morgantown high school always has mongrels. Like every time I've had to do that challenge that's where I go
---
Big if true
---
I get the Division vibes. I'm excited about this
---
The internet sometimes makes it hard to avoid spoilers, and it seems like a lot of mysteries don't stay mysteries for very long. datamining the game to get the puzzles ahead of time seems pretty cheap to me, personally, but to each their own.
---
Good thing is, if you can put aside the fact that the solution is a search away, there's nothing really stopping you from enjoying the mystery and taking a stab at breaking the codes yourself as they are revealed in the game.
---
I'm still on it is 10:30am
---
there's the Burrows. look for some manhole covers new Harper's Ferry.
---
most "dungeons" are gonna be buildings thay have no actual quests associated with them. just exploration.
---
Except magic weapons. All this update does is make the tiny weapons pool that people care about even smaller.
---
Personally T-65 is better simply due to the modifications being far easier to obtain than Ultracite, which are used for Strangler Heart. If you think you can get Ultracite plans for Emergency Protocols and Calibrated Shocks, then go for Strangler Heart, if not, then go for T-65.
---
&gt;One Wasteland — Creature levels throughout Appalachia will now adjust up or down on the fly to more closely match your own level as you come across them. For example, if you and a much lower-level friend both encounter the same creature, its level will simultaneously adjust to be higher for you and lower for your friend. Enemy loot and XP also scale when their levels are adjusted this way, so you won’t miss out on any rewards. As a result, you and your pals will be able to adventure anywhere together—even if there’s a level gap between you.
---
combination of the two
---
Great tool btw. Thanks. A few times i have went to scrip something and then checked and its shown to be worth like 10k.
---
For some people there's not much to buy. I'm not interested in the gauss minigun, T-65, solar, or strangler heart items. I've bought everything I want and I've got a tonne of bullion and treasury notes.
---
Probably the reason the added the ammo crafting legendary perk, and let it work with ammosmith and super duper.
---
And the ammo machine, and the ammo converter aswell.
---
It’s the only fun way to use missiles. It’s not a great system, and I ignore it most of the time. It’s more satisfying than dropping them at least.
---
Solar
---
I'm a melee build would be screwed if this is actually added to the game.
---
Bloodied was hit the hardest along with melee. If you know how math works then junkie, anti armor and instigating would be a better choice now in pts. 
---
OFC bloodied would do a bit more damage then junkie but it’s not a large difference between the 2 now.
---
I welcome this change even though I use bloodied build.
---
I'm sure  you've benefited from people doing that as well. If that gets fixed, I'll never launch another nuke.
---
What’s says the power armor “display” I’ve  heard mentioned,Is in fact a “display”,&amp; not just another skin for the power armor workbench jammy...
---
Like the other various ones we already have?
---
Does it say it’s a “display” somewhere that I haven’t seen?
---
I personally think it's too high, a 200 limit is more then enough /s
---
I thought games were meant to be fun? In a game where it plays out like single player but with other people around, why should it matter if one person is playing easier than others? If they wanted a challenge they could remove their perk cards and give themselves less damage output. People play the way they do because that’s what they like. That’s what they found fun. Like my knife build which just lost all viability
---
This question's answer is 100% of the reason why it took so long ;)
---
And this is why we only did that once we had a baseline calculated output with multiple values against which the gathered feedback could be compared automatically. There's a lot of stuff going on in the backend with this Price Feedback feature in mind.
---
There aren’t really “dungeons” in the traditional sense. Just locations to explore.
---
I love dropping lower levels a full set of deep pocket armor, a BOS rifle, and if they are high enough a fixer at the closest level they are at. The funny part is getting them to understand what's going on and actually grab the gifts. I roleplay a Responder in game. If you are on PC it's the same screen name.
---
It seems i got another Grudge that goes into my Book.
---
Glad to hear.  Best of luck!
---
How would I trigger the chain quest
---
No, I emptied a few hundred rounds out of it before realizing I never had to repair it, especially being explosive.
---
Please not again... I'm still recovering from the last time. 
---
I still freak out he pulled the pin man!
---
Server hop, thats the name of the game
---
I can make one!
---
Edit: r/FO76ProTips
---
Nah I love playing it but idk
---
Go to the tattoo shop near VTU 👍
---
..camp budget monitor UI
---
I feel like a lot of the metamancers are trying to make *everyone* feel like they're also being effected, when in actuality it's just closing the power gap from the casual and min maxing players, which is a welcome change imo
---
The game also has some really fun fights but many never notice because currently the meta builds are insanely strong, enemies like the Grafton monster have interesting attacks and movesets but you would never know cuz it's so easy to kill them in under 3 seconds 
---
I really don't understand why people are saying they are just adding damage sponges, like enemies are way too fragile at the moment, to the point it actually hurts the game
---
I don't know what the opposite of a damage sponge would be, damage paper? Lol 
---
Whatever it's called, that's the current status of the game, and I'm glad they're doing something about it
---
nice to bring it back as content that you can play and earn if you missed, respects the effor people put into the legendary run in the case that you need to farm gold bullion and uses a system that is engaged in gameplay, nice, they could just added to the atom shop (the lazy greedy way) but they chose not to... nice.  
---
lets see if this comes to the game and not only on PTS.
---
Yeah. We now have to shoot them twice instead of once
---
Well yeah, you went from one of the easiest to get lowest conversion rate ammos to one of the highest conversion rate ammos so if course it wasn't much.
---
Railway spikes are 300 for 1k points. I can get ~900 spikes from one of the events I listed so 3k points. 3k points is usually good for at least several hundred of any other ammo. I save up and do 10k points for 2k flamer fuel myself.
---
I just explore the land, kill shit  to feel like a badass and scour everything for lore. I'm a simple raider.
---
Unyielding and adrenal reaction will still be the meta, it seems that the only change will be two shot explosive making a comeback,someone tested it and it seems that it now makes more damage than bloodied explosive, also legacy weapons are still OP making them the best option in game, when it comes to messing things up Bethesda is the best.
---
Yup I agree.  I use a bloody build and this change will allow me to rethink what I want to build as rather then the only choice being bloodied due to the large damage difference.
---
I have mixed feelings about it. Like I like that items can be bought in game, but it also makes it lose some of the speciality of doing it then. I like the way Final Fantasy XIV does it, two years after the event they make it available to buy. That makes it so people can always get the items no matter how late they started, but there’s also an exclusivity for people who did it then. Granted, XIV makes you buy it with real money, which I’m not a fan of, but I like the delay. I do think 2 years would be too long for 76, but 6-12 months might be good, and then items like lunchboxes are instant. Maybe have them rotate out with future season rewards could work. That said, I only started 76 a few weeks ago, so I may not have the best grasp to make this opinion. I’m just going off things in other MMOs. That said, this is much better than them not being available at all.
---
They are just pissed cause their builds are getting nerfed a bit more than other builds
---
Because farming ammo ingredients every day is not fun, and bullet sponge enemies are not fun either. Its not HaRdCoRe or anything, its just tedious. In their classic manner bethesda screwed every potentially good change in the patch. Instead of carefully balancing perks and builds they just mindlessly changed the whole formula for everyone, making low damage builds just laughable and even more pushing people in the single broken/overpowered meta. Defending this approch means defending beths incredible laziness and incomprehension of their own game. Thats why we are stuck in an endless loop of broken stuff and dissapointment every patch.
---
And let me tell you something that ruins all your logic. Magic weapons and legacy are still in the game and they oneshot everything. I was using fun and goofy weapons all the time, but now I'll just stick to my oneshot shotgun since "good old AA weapons" are even worse now than before.
---
I wish I could up vote again. Finally getting pistol buffs
---
I would love more weapon skins. I don’t think Bethesda fully realizes how much money they could make by making some high quality weapon skins and armor cosmetics. There is a reason those types of mods are so popular in their other games.
---
People have been wanting a balance. They nerfed literally every thing. People wanted other effects to get buffs so they could come close to bloodied. Instead they just made every effect worse. That's why people are upset
---
No, the fog crawlers are crustaceans
---
&gt; How else would BGS encourage that area to be used?
---
1. Add some more or rare rewards to the loot list of enemies in that area. 
---
2. Disable V.A.T.S. against other players in the pvp area so that it can't be using to discover other players by spamming V.A.T.S. 
---
3. Remove other non-players except teammates from the compass while you are in the pvp area. 
---
 Gives me a Runescape wilderness vibe.
---
I thought it was just me.  The last week I've been apathetic, I jump on for 40 min in the morning, do 2-3 easy dailies, get my gold and sit hoping to sell my spare ammo. Lol.
---
Cause other people are out there actively hunting them down for dailies, obviously
---
berry mentats?
---
They're steam users that haven't created a bethesda account.
---
It really isn’t much fun killing high lvl enemies like the queen for 1,2, rarely 3 * rewards. They need to give us better incentive to do those high lvl events instead of making it harder for me and still give the same lackluster rewards .
---
Huh I assumed they were insects.
---
Honestly since I finished the run a few days ago, I’ve barely played 76 now. 
---
I don’t have to log on every day for score points now, or to get atoms from daily challenges. There’s nothing to drive me when I hop on to play anymore. I tried making a new character and that kinda staved off the boredom a little bit, but I’d still rather have some daily stuff to keep me logging on.
---
Usually I log on, do my daily chores which took about 20 minutes that gave me some kinda gain, then by the time I’m done I usually find something else to do. Now I’m feeling like I’m gaining nothing by logging on and that’s kinda took the wind out of my sails.
---
...I don’t missing having to play hot garbage Nuclear Winter once a day at all though, f*ck that game mode and the challenges tied to it. Finally free of that bullsh*t.
---
Someones been chewing that maca root..
---
That takes longer as they don't have the perk cards or gear to kill things quickly enough.
---
&gt;What I don't understand is why every time someone talks about wanting more space they always get downvoted and lots of negative comments. 
---
I'm pretty certain at this point that Bethesda employees have phony accounts on here.  There's elements to this game that don't make sense and are simply impossible to rationalize or defend, and yet you see posts  rationalizing them. 
---
There's many posts defending things  that no person who actually plays the game could possibly defend.  So I am convinced that Bethesda pays people to do it with using fake accounts.
---
Not that much of a bump given that everything else was nerfed, so no they will not be better than before. They're actually in worse shape now.
---
Nerf the damage out put. They get upset. If Bethesda had made the bosses tougher with a buff. Those same people would get upset. I welcome the change. It is a step in a direction. Good or Bad. It isn't stale. If it doesn't work out they can adjust things again. I'm glad there is change. Change is good. I'll still be in the wasteland.
---
This
---
More than you think. Armor piercing is still multiplicative. It’s also relative to other weapons in the update.
---
I really like that we can use Gold Bullion to buy Lunch Boxes!
---
Damage disparity did decrease a lot with this patch. It's these bloodied fanatics that are freaking out cause they are seeing a big amount of decrease in their damage output while others aren't seeing much of that
---
Yeah they solved it on the PTS before the message even came live lol
---
exactly , at least something to play at lvl 300+
---
Pretty sure that’s what this is for. It makes the calculation easier
---
NO THANKS
---
I run 4 characters .. My highest is 74, my lowest is 71 .. I am confident I can make it for sure. I think you good at 60 .. we still have 2 - 3 weeks if not longer .. so you should be fine if you keep doing most of your dailies and weeklies ...
---
Read the fraternity party poster found at every train station.
---
Also some train stations have a poster about a party.
---
I shouldn’t have to make 4 other characters just to hold stuff for my main character... That’s my thoughts on the matter.
---
(I’d day we’re due for an upgrade to 1200, or the very least 1000.)
---
disgusting
---
And adding on to what your saying two gutsy is certai N death because you punch the first one but you don't mange to kill it they both will attack you
---
Great attitude man. Completely agree. Nice to see some positivity
---
Well you can just get a moove on then
---
I’m having the same issue, without 02 spawns for me, 01 never does
---
They should be a bit cheaper, 50 gold would be a more fair price I would think.
---
Fallout 76 doesn't really have Dungeons, there are world events you can join though. Most events start as soon as you enter the zone but it gets broadcast on the server.  So keep an eye on the events notifications on the top left of your screen, it will usually give you a recommended player level - but you will have to find the yellow event on the map and click on it to join.  
---
Another fun thing to do with your friends is to take over a workshop because you will get to build defences and mine for resources and your workshop will get attacked usually every 15-20 minutes or so.  Not all the resources are worth it but have a go and see what you think.  :)
---
thats what yall get for bitching about unneeded "balance" for months now..
---
good luck farming for mats in low level areas.. 
---
el oh fucking el.. yall got what you asked for...
---
I have money, I still wouldn't pay to level up, just not in my blood, I guess I have more sense .. I get as far as I get. Again, if it were 7th Sep or whenever the season ends and people want all the rewards, I can see them wanting to pay or use atoms, but not do it now even if you did lack time. Paying $150 is just silly no matter how you look at it, but you right, if you got money to waste and no sense then go for it I suppose.
---
never even thought of that haha
---
How is this balancing the game
---
Level 35 really isn't a position to judge, enemies have always been like that without builds and gear. That would be the point of builds and gear. The changes, which really are needed, are more aimed at the high level and damge players. What would be the point of adding things like daily ops etc if players can kill them in a second?
---
Yes you could have :)
---
Lol imagine buying the ammo converter for 1200 bulls
---
ill try that cheers
---
There is some stupid stuff I want too but I'm fine with it never getting in I just hope we get less of the same stuff like the SS skins they did 2 and they are basically the same
---
I will add you, my name is BeSerious.   
---
What type weapon do you use?
---
Alright, I’ll be on for most of the day.
---
i think there's a certain percentage of the player base who are *always* unhappy and will always complaint, and Bethesda cannot win with them.
---
This means valid complaints often disappear in the mix
---
Again, it’s fine if you don’t like a challenge/sense of accomplishment. No need to get defensive.
---
What I mean is, most of what stash affects is the amount of your time you have to waste looking for things you had to throw away previously. The only advantage I can think of is being able to enjoy the game more. An unlimited stash would not make the quest lines easier, nor rarities easier to find, nor bullets any cheaper to build.
---
Ultimately, if I finish the quests slower or faster than anyone else, neither of us win anything. I guess I don't see the relevance of pay to win in a game where most players have PvP disabled.
---
Let's say I could pay money to have the most powerful character with all the greatest weapons and armor. That's no different than being many levels higher than another player, and currently, it doesn't affect anything other than which of us can kill monster faster.
---
There were some overall PvP things planned related to the in game presidency, but those were apparently canceled.
---
that's not true at all. check the official forums. unarmed, melee or otherwise, is now essentially useless. fringe builds are now even worse. people are wasting 2 to 4 times more ammunition in general.
---
" why they never stop coming? "  
---
Because there would be nothing to do if there are no Enemys.  
---
" why they can still see me when I'm sneaking in the Stealth suit? "  
---
Because it would be more then broken to just hide from Enemys and leave them with no clue where you are. And thats a good think that they can spot you even if you have a Steahl Suit on.  
---
"" Update 3: One of the mutations is resilience meaning you can only kill enemies with the melee attack. In my case these werensupermutants. With 14 strength, and supressor super sledge, I was unable to kill even one of these supermutants at all. Feels like for us who collected lots of weapons during the first Legendary Run these Daily Ops are like hit-n-miss. I mean, melee perks are in Strength, if I adapt to melee I won't be able to sprint. ""  
---
And thats the Point from those Mutations. A similar thing in WoW with the affixes they have in Dungeons. To make it a little bit more spicy.   
---
""if I adapt to melee I won't be able to sprint.""
---
So you need to think different for this situation in the Video Game, how bad.
---
What is season 2 exactly? Is it just the stupid BoS thing at ATLAS Observatory? Season 1 was the board game which I completed, just want to make sure the BoS is "season 2", and is there any more to it other than dropping stacks of materials? Super lame unless I'm missing something lol
---
Those foam #1 that people use at sporting events and whatnot.
---
I usually get worthless heavy weapons. All the time 3/5 of my rolls are heavy weapons with horrible affects. 
---
That 3 star bloodied fixer, while not god tier, was a complete game changer for me. It is wonderful. RNGesus usually hates me in games, and usually does in this too (I imagine pretty much everyone feels this) 
---
I feel like I willed it into existence. Was the first time I went spending scrip knowing exactly what I wanted, and lo and behold I got it. On my first roll too! I freaked out a bit.
---
Idk. Some of the costumes and Chinese stuff is pretty cool. I prefer this season to the last one, if not due to the fact i like GI Joe more then Flash Gordon
---
i dont think they could fix it without complety reworking netcode lol
---
I feel sorry for them melees. They weren't that good in the first place other than big damage output. Hopefully Bethesda will come up with something as a compensation. But bloodied meta gotta go. Way too much damage. This is how it should be
---
I get it but we said this years back on them going ham on the atomic shop prices then the sub same thing people said and now this lol. How much do they need imo
---
“STOP FOLLOWING ME DEMON!! Leave me and my family ALONE!!”
---
Jangles: * *Stares Menacingly* *
---
Yea maybe. I only started playing in feb of this year...there is still stuff for me todo I just don’t have the desire todo it...launching a nuke and the imposter Sheepsquatch missions is all I really have.
---
Sorry... I’m just exhausted. I tested the PTS for the first time last night, saw my damage, and immediately lost all interest. I’ve been wanting to stop playing and I only got on to do the dailies so I could finish the Season. But seeing my favorite build get wiped off the map like that... I don’t want to keep playing. I enjoyed what I had. Yes I could switch to a stronger weapon. But that’s not what I had fun with. I loved running around with knives or rolling pins or lead pipes and doing adequate. It wasn’t even over powered. But not only is it nerfed, but there won’t be any more low level enemies to play with these tools on since they’ll all scale up. So my favorite build just got fucked. It feels exhausting
---
That's due to the Dental Plan that all ZAX AI's receive.
---
This is fine with me. I finished the run, let ppl that didn’t have time or whatever to be able to grind for gold and get it.
---
Glass...building...tiles
---
And the nuka cola lamp.
---
I like the idea of high levels everywhere. Borrows and WesTek may arguably be the best, but I don't want to be restricted to those. If I fast travel to places like the Forest, I'd really hate to encounter a three star legendary chicken that's level 1...l
---
Plus I have 24 lunchboxes still
---
Depends how much new content and development people want.
---
Being a new Vegas veteran I’d say this would be another way to make caps lol
---
Well, in Fallout 4, there was the settlement system and settlement supply lines you had to set up, then you needed to have a lot of materials in order to build all of the settlements. 
---
You could build elaborate settlements with tons of stuff and have many sets of power armor on display and plenty of materials in your toolbox for whatever.
---
I got used to that, and I liked it, so I think it was a mistake to change that.
---
The best ways that Bethesda could improve Fallout 76 is to rethink the ways they strayed away from Fallout 4, and go back to superior design decisions.
---
I have but the door is chained
---
Give them away or transfer to a new character via the Private Server.
---
you always try to defuse genuine criticism with passive remarks. no, the problem isn't that they're getting 'defensive' or that they 'dislike a challenge', don't be disingenuous about it because you can't argue against it.
---
That seems fair. 200 gold for what's basically a double xp boost seems cheap... But by the time you Max alliances with the settlers and reach the late game grind, the boost is more or less needed.
---
So, yeah. 50 a piece seems good.
---
They made min maxers and casuals more closer in damage. It also helps the devs due to being easier to design mobs using a system that is addictive then multiplicative.
---
This change also changes bloodied to be not extremely op compared to the 2nd best build which is junkies since bloodied relies on multiplicative multipliers.
---
This is a much needed change which should have been in the game at the start.
---
&gt; This was not JUST a Bloodied nerf. Just about everything got nerfed
---
Ok so everything got nerfed so the crappy builds are even crappier now
---
Isn’t that exactly the sort of thing they are wanting to get feedback on and the purpose of the PTS?
---
Im one of the admins on the datamine discord ;)
---
You got a video of someone one-shotting the queen?
---
I think if they plan to actually implement these changes it should come alongside with the Ammo Factory Legendary Perk Card.  Ammo management for everyone will be more annoying so it would be nice if we could mitigate that.
---
I reckon Point Pleasant will be fun too.
---
I was under the impression that part of this was so that low level players aren't screwed over when a high level has graced the area.
---
I remember this when I was leveling up on my first character.
---
Go to do some story stuff, at level 30-40, and having to fight off level 62 ghouls or super mutants.
---
It wasn't too bad for me since I was a stealth sniper at the time, had to line up those starting head shots. But for others, who rely on VATS, they would have rage quit after blowing all their ammo.
---
I have a Vampire Explosive Laser Gatling. As long as it's pointed at something, I am invincible.
---
I'd agree if this was your usual, run of the mill mmo. but that's not how Bethesda handles it nor how a good chunk of the playerbase sees it. what you're saying is akin to 'I think explosive should be nerfed in Fo4' because a lot of people play solo. there's hardly any competitive content.
---
I see little reason to nerf things in what's essentially a coop game.
---
That's great, I was hoping they'd do something like this.
---
Been around since Beta. This game has changed so much. In all honesty they have pushed the engine and their servers beyond breaking point. Without an investment into better servers and a new engine there will always be issues with this game.
---
If your stuck on analyzing the blood sample what worked for me was trying a private server.  You can also try analyzeing the blood sample after putting the T-fuse in the fuse box, so you have to do it before.
---
It’s not that bad of a grind . It’s not like I’m trying hard to lvl right now . I switched my build and I’m lvling super fast
---
My AAE handmade is currently doing about 200 more damage per hit than my b2525 against harder mobs
---
Does this mean enemies will match our level? Me being level 213 and highest enemy is a 90 something deathclaw, will they match me? What about gun level? Will those match us too?
---
Better get a lead lined condom
---
I nuked WS last weekend, got 7 legendaries first run, 3 legendaries second. Was like 3 ppl on a server (night time) and noone came to WS, all ghouls was mine
---
Ehm and leave all other fucking good rewards out ? Like the Bunker or the other Camp Buildings and the Skins ?  
---
Not to mention that the Med Kits are not useless. There are Players that can use them, the same for the Caps or other rewards in that list. I would agree if this would be content for High level Players but its not. Its fitting.
---
It seems to be a lot slower to trigger than it used to be.  Do you run rank 1?
---
Thanks for the sarcasm and such. Really appreciated. 
---
My mistake is that I didn't read patch notes. 
---
Its fine to adapt and so on.
---
The only really bad thing is that if you have lots of legendary weapons that you don't want to sell, and your stash is full, you are stuck with overweight when you get into PA. In PTS I had to scrip some of the lesser good legendary weapons to be able to sprint at least in Excavator PA w/o PA.
---
Yes, and I’ll be sure to send in my feedback, but it’s important to note that this shows they have an intent to nerf damage. Sure it might not be that they want it down this far, but it shows that they have this in mind. Overall they want to stretch out every aspect of this game. They don’t like things being able to be completed quickly. It’s better for analytic numbers if people get on everyday. And lowering damage will drastically increase play time when every kill takes slightly more time than before, since this entire game is killing enemies (1,000 enemies that take 1 second to kill is 1,000 seconds. Now make it 1.1 seconds and you’ve now added 10% more play time. This is much more than 10%). So realistically, I don’t have any hope that the change will be drastic enough to make my build viable by the time they finish
---
That's actaully a pretty good idea. Congrats Bethesda, you get one clap... but no more.
---
Sounds about right for Uncle Sam. We give him all our money, and he gives us crap.
---
After seeing that video where all the big devs were talking about the changes they want to make etc, I actually think a lot of this is just down to the fact that these people are sat working from home and they're limited in terms of communication and time in general.
---
They all looked so tired and just - human! If you know want I mean, so I do feel sorry for them that covid is kicking them while they're down.
---
See how I got YOU talking
---
This nothing, It could be amazing if people where more communicative but it feels lonely out in the waste
---
I feel like my luck sucks on her. However I did get my magic shotgun from an event a while ago so now I run Chinese Stealth Armor shotgun build one shit everything in vats except scortchbeast and Colossus
---
Oooh! I use your site guys. I love it. It helped me understand the value of the item in my hands. It's like that antique road show they give some incite if that item you got from garage sales is something. I always knew my one weapon was pretty good. I used your site and it said 24000. It is still my favorite weapon to use too. Thanks.
---
😂😂
---
Fallout 76 lucky wheel where instead of a car being the grand prize it's just a good legendary roll
---
Yes I do, I keep testing it and it doesn’t heal me when I fall from height
---
Nice, the first raid vault is probably going to be turned into a dungeon, and we might finally get the chance to kill that smug POS Zax.
---
DO IT! JUST DO IT! bethesda please.
---
I don't think they will ever change the engine, for some reason Bethesda are set on using the Creation Engine no matter what, even with Starfield they've said that it's gonna use the same engine, but I don't doubt that with enough people, time and money invested they can do whatever they do with this engine, despite how old this engine is and how easy it can break it's a very easy to use and flexible engine.
---
I don't necessarily see it as a nerf. I see it as balancing it's just that they chose to decrease damage output rather than increase cause mobs are already way too squishy in this game
---
Wendigo riding a rad-spider.... just saying.
---
Just killed 4 there myself
---
There are better ways to f&amp;$k up a person's camp without any two minute warning.
---
Literally can't play? The servers go down in your part of the world for 24 hours at a time? I digress.
---
I get that the suggestion is they give more time to complete a larger SCORE; they already did that once. Now you don't have to do NW and you can still finish ahead of schedule. Even leveling up can be done with a new toon in about 20 minutes.
---
If you want something for everyone, that's the beret and flagpole. This is cosmetic crap\*, the armor and weapons and tech are all bullion and you can do that at your lesiure. It doesn't help to hurry, you get 200 a day max anyway. People complain about that shit too.
---
Don't worry, it's all going to wind up in the atom shop, even though I get the problems with pay to not play as a model. :D
---
\*much of which is buggy AF
---
I personally dont mind the change since my build isnt super focused on damage anyway and I like more of a challenge, but I know some people who feel like all the work they've put into their build will go to waste with the update(which I dont really agree with since they'll still be doing a shit ton of damage)
---
The planetarium definitely projects constalations as well as plays classical music. Seen it in multiple camps.
---
I play on ps4 so idk if there is a chat. Ill try that next time I play tho.
---
It doesn’t trigger even when I’m at 5% health with no rad
---
Wait, you hate the bos but you gather technical data for them?
---
To me, more than stash, it’s camp budget. Because there are workarounds for stash (mules, scrapbox) but there is no workaround for camp
---
IT
---
You're right in that some of the loudest voices will never be happy, but (maybe I'm optimistic) I like to think that is a vocal minority. I think the OP is also correct. I normally just scroll and read and rarely ever post, which I assume more of us in the community are like. 
---
It also just seems odd that they make changes/"fixes" to things that seem so minor too. Like Ward wandering or double-sided walls, etc. Yet we still have broken vats, fast travel issues, hacking in NW, stash space, massively delayed content, and other QOL issues just persist whereas the atom shop will always be updated.
---
I agree. I hate seeing a death claw and go wow this guy is pathetic and dies in one hit. Now it takes 3 or 4 and people are freaking out.
---
Not trying to be an asshole but 98.7% of suggestions made in this subreddit are just plain stupid or unrealistic
---
Next season, you will be able buy it with gold from one of the factions.
---
Because this isn’t a single player game. People one shotting  legendaries in public events makes it less fun for others. Nobody cares about glitched OP guns in Fallout 4, but you need balance in multiplayer games.
---
They could go the gta route and just not allow it in certain countries. I really don’t think gambling is a good idea to introduce
---
They purposely made them 0.1 lbs because ppl duped them by the millions....shit was funny cause it was unannounced and ppl went ballistic cause they had to get rid of so many
---
Nope nope nope nope nope.......... the cave crickets are bad enough with those legs and the way they move
---
You’re about 1/3 of the way through. It is possible to solo, I’ve done it as a stealth build.
---
Your sense of community is misguided. We are working with the tools they gave us and your putting blame on something we have no power to change. Support your fellow player it feels good, I promise.
---
In the great words of Mr Rogers "Look for the helpers."
---
Good news for you bro, it is actually paint for the super sledge!

---
Has anyone seen if the "magical" weapons still work in PTS? Because the changes to all DSP nerfs seems like players may just gravitate to those weapons next
---
Even before Covid it's obvious that each dev was and still is doing more than their share of work, they are clearly understaffed and it's not right, and now on top of that they are working from their homes instead of having a break, why do they work from home anyway? They don't have to as far as I'm aware, other studios like Capcom delayed content for their live service games during lock down, so why does Bethesda devs have to work?
---
I Hope that spider will never exist, I am yet frightned by the ghouls
---
[PIPE IS LIFE](https://i.imgur.com/ivoX75r.png)
---
When I first found FED76 a few weeks ago, I'd see something like "This weapon is worth 3000-6000, but some buyers could pay over 6000" or something like that. Now I'm seeing "This could go for 3000-6000, but some buyers might pay over 20000"
---
That's a big jump.... it seems like the "some players might pay..." used to be a little higher than the top estimated price, but now it's much higher. Is that intentional? I mean, I know these are all just estimates, but it's odd.
---
I sent them a message over a week ago. Still waiting for them to reply.
---
My clips constantly reload halfway empty. Or reload, fire 1 shot then auto reload again. Extremely frustrating!
---
Where is this vendor?
---
To be honest I don't know any country that for sure allows online gambling but that's just my ignorance. I still think they should add a casino, as it fits with the theme, other games in the series had it and it's not like there isn't already gambling in the game, I do see why one may worry though.
---
It’s fucked up man idk why it’s so complicated
---
I admire your optimism
---
I think you buy 3 for 100 gold
---
Take a look at Season 2. It gets worse.
---
Finish the pipes and you are about halfway through.  It can easily be soloed but the first few times will probably involve a lot of getting lost and not knowing exactly what to do.  After a few runs it becomes pretty easy and quick.
---
I solo them all the time. Takes longer though
---
More of them spawn later in the match too. I had these same spawn questions a few weeks back.
---
Please no, the scorpions are scary enough :(
---
There are other ways to combat that and that’s about the only excuse people have (PvP is the only other excuse) for nerfing other players around them. They could have it be that it’s range based tagging so if you’re close enough you get loot anyway. Teams already do this so it’s 100% possible. People act like the only solution is to reduce damage. Then people like me who don’t use an overpowered build but just get by with something fun get hit. This is the most negative solution if the goal was to fix that issue
---
E: especially an issue that you aren’t going to be encountering more than 90% of your overall playtime. This nerf you’ll experience in about 90% of your overall playtime
---
Honestly it's probably just anger from people who spent a lot of time or caps for their perfect roll. Personally I'm happy with the nerf, anything that gets rid of anti-fun, overpowered builds is alright in my book.
---
Too bad 3 missiles give a very low amount of points
---
Genuine criticism is fine. Calls to make the game easier are kind of silly. I think I’m allowed to voice my opinion and criticism that I think the game is too easy. Is only your criticism allowed?
---
Just gotta say as the Australian here, there is one place we fear and that’s South America and it’s spiders
---
Doing more research and there’s one time you get those. One for health, one for rads, and one for nukashine. 
---
So it’s not really that horrible getting those.
---
That could be grounded, maybe.
---
I think it’s a bad idea. FO76 is turning into a millenial “prizes for everyone” group play event. It should be a game, where failure has consequences. Where is the tension, if everyone wins ?
---
So they are like literally every other company. Thanks.
---
can you do it solo, (you can skip this part too(pipes))
---
the best is to be prepared, you have a lot of youtube videos if you want.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qyLyUPAIB8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qyLyUPAIB8)
---
Thanks people :)
---
Oh, hadn't noticed that.
---
In that case, 100 gold is certainly a fair price imo.
---
It took 5 minutes of following him yesterday to see his items. Only after a ghoul attacked him did I finally see his wares.
---
I have no use for a lot of the available items, so I’d rather spend bullion on lunchboxes that will provide some benefit.  I don’t want some of the unwanted weapon plans to water down Purveyor rolls either, so I’ll never buy them even if I hit the bullion limit.
---
If it really is just *one* of each, then IDRC. At least it’s not scrap kits
---
I have done this only 2 times at level 40. The First Time solo and was Easy, the second time with other 2 people and was terrible, if You are in team then Will spawn much enemy than when You are solo and You Will spend a lot of time, so I suggest to do this solo and in team only for fun.
---
I’m still curious as to how that would work.
---
A lot of it is the thinking of "With all of the shit that is wonky in this game, THIS is what they spend their time dinking with?"
---
We've been asking for card and legendary prefix rebalances since release.
---
For new Players its nice and i dont see any problem with Scrap, Caps or the other Stuff. Not every Player swims with those Items. Not to mention that (besides the Communist skins for me) all other rewards are more then worth to get them. For me alone the Brotherhood Bunker is resone alone to farm for it.  
---
"" taking away our atoms ""  
---
And replace some of that with new Camp Stuff and more then enough Skins ?  
---
There is a actuall use to some Players for those Med Kits, Caps, Gold etc. But the only complain that is left from you is just "i dont like it, i want something else".
---
If there aren't dungeons, what are the leveled instances? I've found 2 now. Both at the Charleston Capital Building.
---
Its clearly 3 in stock for 100 each
---
Should be aboot 20 mins
---
I also use it. Mine is called #####MONSTER##### so it stays at the top of my inventory . Rename it.
---
Hey they finally after nearly 2 years have gotten around to nerfing bloody builds that people clamour for, granted it nerfs all weapons.   
---
Also hey mannequins finally that only took nearly two years also.  So interior walls will be 2022 maybe?
---
Apparently a load out system has been in the works. I think they brought it up again in quakecon but I don't think we'll see it til winter or 2021
---
Shortly after they turn it into Randy Savage.
---
It’s not about the game being “stale” this change does nothing but make the game more grindy. It’s not like they added any new enemies or changes the health pool of enemies, just nerfed everyone’s damage.
---
This literally hurts everyone who doesn’t have a duped weapon.
---
I also don’t think the game should be completed quickly, you miss a lot of the story and then people get bored saying there is nothing to do. My first play through I did this and was disappointed. I played a second time and took my time and enjoyed it a lot more. I personally think the game is too easy. Too easy makes it boring IMO.
---
Just checked and that isn't the case.  
---
Thanks anyway.
---
I feel like a hoarder in this game. But, as I have grown. I see that it's ok to literally let go. I don't think about the legendaries I throw away. I don't scrip it, sell it or give it away. I find a nice empty field and drop it. If a lucky player should find my hidden bag. It's theirs to enjoy. I do wish I could hold onto my bobble heads and comic books/magazines without them taking up too much budget. I enjoy building. So I wish I could put more things on display. Same with junk I mostly bulk and sell. I know where to find most things so if I need to build something. I get what I need and that's it. Vending I put things people will need. Nuke cards. Flux. Food (mostly xp boosters) I don't do ammo. Too many people sell that. Crap I throw ammo away all the time. If I play the game I end up with so much ammo. Anywho I'm rambling again. Does anyone know if a green nurses outfit is rare? Found it yesterday.
---
You can solo the silo, it is pretty easy, just lots of bubble guns and robots.
---
Be sure to post about it on the bethesda.net PTS forum, maybe they'll tweak it.
---
Except they have listened on many occasions. I'm not saying they can't do better (because they could) but things like adding voiced NPCs, player vending, dialogue choices, speech/skill checks, more customization, etc shows they do pay attention. Unfortunately they just seem to have too much of a plan setup to make changes usually. But don't forget they've delayed content on multiple occasions to improve quality. Again, they've screwed up alot, but saying they never listen is inaccurate. 
---
Hell, they even apologized and said they're gonna reverse changes made to camps in patch 21, that was them listening.
---
Ahhh nice
---
Yeah. I crushed this season but was underwhelmed with some rewards (looking at you perk cards and caps) but the next season looks waay better
---
Ok but thats you. I don’t care for the story and even if it was harder I wouldn’t go out and explore it. Some people don’t want to do that. Making things harder doesn’t change that. The people that want to experience it will. The people that don’t will bypass it no matter what. Dealing less damage doesn’t translate to going out and looking up terminals or listening to holotapes now
---
or if they do listen youll hate what their solution is..
---
im looking at you 1wasteland...
---
Doesn't help the people presenting them present them like assholes, i know I hate it when people tell me how to do my job,I can't imagine being a community manager
---
Post about it on the PTS forums and they might listen.
---
Why would you open them at the end of events?
---
No more new contents until bugs are fixed, bye see u no more
---
Give your feedback on the PTS forums and maybe they'll fix it.
---
Dang, but no nuke was launched before this one, I'm hoping a was just a one time glitch and that I'll be able to kill more today
---
Thanks liked and subscribed :)
---
To be honest most online games comparable to Fallout 76 have balance updates all the time. This games last big balance update was when a base, no perks/stats adding damage, TSE handmade did around 3000 damage
---
Or picklock the door and hack and walk throw
---
It all depends on the item/effects combination. Was it for the same weapon?
---
And yep there are items in this game that majority will consider scrip but educated buyers will pay legacies for. We changed this last line today to provide more text and less numbers.
---
Heavy gunners seem like the best overall for ops. They have the str ( perk slots ) to deal large damage if Enemies can only be damaged in melee and run and gun if it’s  anything else. 
---
Don’t forget about the legendary cards. Those added stats with perks or added abilities will make a big difference.
---
&gt; It lost a good chunk of damage and so did all the other classes, its still going to be king, just not over powered.
---
Thats the problem though.  A weapon rebalance that nerfs everything across the board sucks.  Other weapons and builds should be brought up rather than having the best builds brought down.
---
Ra Ra
---
The raiders vendor is inside the Crater core, and the settlers vendor is in Foundation near the entrance to the underground section.
---
This glitch is still present, this post is still helping. :)
---
Bethesda have actually added a lot of things as a result of player suggestions. Hell, they even added content based on a joke YouTube video a player made. Generally speaking companies are under no obligation whatsoever to pay attention to these things. It's their IP to do what they want with. Try writing to a tv studio and telling them how to change their shows or tell McDonald's your burger ideas; it's the same principle.
---
Beth are guilty of a lot of things but this isn't one of them.
---
Sounds like a good idea, since the game just gets progressively worse to play over time if new players are just deprived of more and more gameplay as time goes on (as well as players not constantly keeping up).
---
Well, sometimes before them too, just for the fact that a lot of people gather there, so more people get the bonus and a lot of the time others would open more if someone started, so everyone gets the 100% exp boost even if they don't play with a 4 stack which could coordinate it. And generally it created a celebratory atmosphere after beating an event, which was nice.
---
Two-shot explosive.
---
 A bunch of nonsense. You know you sound silly, stop trying to justify punishing players for not being able to do the seasons
---
It can be a gold sink for the future to buy lunchboxes.
---
I’ve got grounded on both, and class freak...same character comparison. 
---
Unless grounded isn’t affecting class freak. I guess I could compare with rad-x active, or on a character without grounded.
---
Is their an image of the board? Not the reward but the one with all the ranks?
---
Balance balance balance since forever,nerf bloodied it needs it, nerf bloodied; they finally do it and WAH WAH WAH they took my damage and lowered it WAH.   
---
I said it a long time ago and I will say it again when they nerf bloodied all guns would be nerfed since they are to lazy to change each prefix after the whole TSE balance scream fest. People still complain about the TSE nerf, well when the forums and reddit are flooded with it what do you think happens. Same with this nerf, people since the TSE have been calling for a bloodied nerf it comes in waves and here it is...Thanks you whiny assholes.
---
Screw it, bethesda add a gail, deathclaw and feral ghoul romance
---
I enjoyed this post.
---
Great work, vaultdweller.
---
people be finding out they dont really want what they been wishing for...
---
This is what I was looking for! Thank you!
---
So there's enemy's that are only damaged threw melee? Huh I'll have to invest in a good melee for my heavy gunner haha
---
Edit, Just remembered I've got a j ss grox axe so I'm good haha (not that you care though XD)
---
I must have missed that comment at quake con. They certainly have added a lot of features based on community feedback (backpacks, purveyor, brewing, instanced dungeons, etc)
---
Good luck trying to get through to people, without getting mass-downvoted.
---
It should be obvious that damage is overtuned right now, when you consider all the legendaries that get 1-shotted in most of the events.
---
One wasteland is so bad. Nerf things, fine. Nerf things and make higher level mobs and then buff those mobs, great.
---
Make everything be the same for every level is so fucking dumb. It's like Oblivion. 5 hours to kill the first rat. Once I've leveled and picked my skills, that rat still took 5 hits.
---
We need hard areas that low levels shouldn't go
---
Locations to explore that were instanced with Wastelanders. They aren’t traditional dungeons (there really aren’t many in this game, if any) in the sense that there’s no “big boss”, no “epic loot chests” at the end, etc.
---
Those are instanced just because of the wastelanders quests they added.
---
Lol you too
---
It’s one of the enemy mutations which is randomized I believe.
---
Welcome to the club. Happened to me once when I first spawned into the world. Other times it spawned me in too high and I got my legs broken.
---
Pro tip about the silos, you can keep the damaged mainframe cores and repair them all at your camp so you dont have to hunt doqn the 15 in the warehouse each time.
---
OP said Corrent not coherent.
---
Nah, just only killed through melee. You can shoot all you want, they just go to 1hp. A gun bash is all you need to finish them off.
---
Clearly not if they just nerfed one shot bloodied builds.
---
Heh, I figured it worked that that this entire time, neat.
---
Gotcha. I'm really excited to try them out. I miss 94 a lot haha
---
From elevator to the launch room in 4 minutes lol
---
&gt;We need hard areas that low levels shouldn't go
---
we have that now.. everyone cried about it..
---
now look what they doing.. lol
---
be careful what you wish for
---
I'm glad they're not an atom shop item
---
Wait. I've played the run just because I wanted chickens and you're telling me I could have just bought them! Damn.
---
oh thanks :p
---
if you have questions don't hesitate.
---
you're not posting criticism, though. you're not making an argument. you're just being disingenuous in trying to defuse *their* criticism without any actual evidence, or even making a point.
---
you essentially just namecalled them in your other post, except you did so gently. instead of calling them 'coward', you said 'they disliked challenges'. you didn't address any of their points, you just defused the situation.
---
actually addressing criticism reads like this:
---
&gt;Calls to make the game easier are kind of silly
---
subjective. a large portion of the playerbase and even Bethesda sees Fo76 as a coop game at best. there's hardly any competitive scope to it, and nerfing what's essentially a pve game, at least to this extreme extend, seems silly to me.
---
Oh that's cool then, maybe throw the shreader in a mini haha
---
I wasn’t sure I’d be able to progress enough for the chicken coop so I’m happy about that
---
I am glad that they are doing this for items that affect gameplay. It reduces the pressure of feeling like I have to max out every season for these rewards. This way, if I end up skipping a season, the only think I will miss out on are the cosmetic rewards.
---
Ah didn’t know this.
---
Yeah....
---
Yeah fuck that.
---
As far as I remember, some can only be KILLED with melee. I took that to mean that you can whittle them down from range, then bash attack them for the final blow. I could be wrong though.
---
Damn, it's pretty hilarious that bloodied is so overused that new damage calculation = bloodied nerf by default.
---
And the many of the more realistic ones have been heard and implemented.
---
It's easy to be the first come when your build instant kills everything
---
And I mixed up your "+" and "=" as well as over-read the "corrent" my stupidity knows no bounds, thanks for answering anyway!
---
It's a completely different level from their mother company, Zenimax. I have recently missed a Crowna Pack sale and messeged Zenimax Support about it. They couldn't help me and apologized, stating that they know it's not the answer I was looking for but still it felt a lot better that no reply at all :(
---
I just spent a long time making an unarmed junkie build... is that going to be completely unviable now?
---
I think the rubberbanding damage, VATS hits not registering and fast travel bugs are partially caused by lag, which is why I’m guessing they’ve proven to be difficult to fix.  
---
I’ll celebrate along with everyone when/if they do get fixed, but I’m not holding my breath.  I just try not to let them irritate me in the meantime.
---
Looking on the bright side, it will be really nice to join SBQ and other end game events without some selfish jackass killing the boss in two seconds, leaving the lower level or undergeared players with nothing.  Of course there’s still ways to stack buffs with melee and kill the SBQ in 1-2 hits, but eliminating magic weapon damage will be beneficial overall.
---
I'm pretty sure fog crawlers are mutated shrimp
---
I feel instead that anything equipped goes above all the rest in its own set so I don't have to scroll down. Anything custom named ahould not be able to be sold until changing it back to normal.
---
Wow, you are really misrepresenting this. 
---
First, companies like this really can't take suggestions and such from public forums. It opens them up to legal issues. Yes it does. For example. Both DC and Marvel comics, will never read a story pitch. If you send them one, they delete it. If you try and verbally pitch it, they will stop you and walk away.
---
This is clearly stated on their website. And my friends, who work for both say this. And for this one reason. If they come up with a story that someone pitched in the past, and the person can prove that someone at company saw the pitch, it opens them to being sued. 
---
So entertainment companies routinely don't look at such ideas and suggestions. 
---
The other thing is this. It takes so long to develop any single aspect of the game. And there's so many changes along the way. For all kinds of reasons. Stuff gets changed and cut and added. 
---
Having players have input during that process? Oh just forget about it. That would literally being a fucking nightmare to work on.
---
And then add to the fact that players can't even agree on simple things. 
---
So yeah, that's what it means when they say they don't take suggestions from players.
---
Word!
---
Idk about you, but instant kill builds don't exactly strike me as skillful.
---
These sound the opposite of fun. Dying over and over sounds frustrating. Many people don’t need a “challenge” to feel validated. They play games for entertainment and to get away from the stress they have in real life. If these “Daily Ops” do not change expect to see as many people attending them as do the horde “events.”
---
yes but my point is that it's silly to nerf what's essentially a pve game. even calling it a mmo is reaching. or do you really think they should go back to Fo4 and nerf the op combos there as well?
---
because that's essentially the same thing as we're seeing here.
---
Everyone should do it the proper way at least once in my opinion.  These days I just clip straight through all the lasers and doors and go straight to launch prep because I'm too lazy to even lockpick or hack lol.
---
That’s just how you do.
---
What exactly did you expect from Bethesda?
---
Guaranteed that they just read a bunch of “ nerf damage” posts and did just thT before clapping themselves on the back and taking a damn nap.
---
There’s literally zero effort put into balancing this game, and now that the whiners have gotten their nerf, the games will be a slow as crawl for everything not bloodied, and the events will fail miserably.
---

---
Wow bet that's a shock when you first spawn in, lol. I was at this player's camp the other day - they built a 3 storey house on a cliff face - and I was on the top floor and they must have logged out because the whole camp disappeared and I fell and died a horrible death, haha.
---
Just watermark the username?
---
Maybe people don’t want that....there is a reason I sell all my melee weapons.
---
Hold up there friend
---
And win more caps....
---
that's the point of playing the game, though. getting stronger. nerfing things feels like sending people back to level 1.
---
As someone who came to the game kinda late, I wish they did that with more items.
---
I'm assuming you have to have their reputation maxed out?
---
I was willing to pay Atoms for them so being gold bullion is even better!
---
So Commandos are still the best to have since they have high DPS?  This makes builds worse.
---
Best for Ops indeed, which is further reinforcing my opinion since launch that they’re  best overall entirely.
---
 I’ve been a HW/explo/PA build since launch, added Bloodied early last year.
---
Super tanky, the only mutation that really affects them is Resiliant and you can just gun bash to finish off enemies, and ammo is easily replenished from enemies.
---
I can throw my main into any situation without any foreknowledge and be pretty confident he can handle it. 
---
I’ve got a full health junkies unarmed alt, bloodied stealth melee, bloodied stealth rifles. All of them would have issues with ops; the junkies did OK but I had to switch to a shotgun on the end boss when it was a robot with freezing touch, because otherwise I couldn’t get close. And I used way more stims and got 2 armor pieces broken during that op compares to my main HW/PA/Bloodied dude.
---
I am non disingenuous and I did not name call. Do not put words in my mouth. Sorry I should have added “IMO” at the end of that response if it wasn’t clear. 
---
Edit: I did say it was my opinion in the following sentence....
---
Perk loadout manager is soooooo good! I just started using it a few days ago and I can't believe that I ever played the game without it!
---
This one has stuff I actually want, interesting. Power armor paints actually make sense when you can finally use em on displays instead of never during gameplay.
---
It is this.
---
I never had to repair the cores after I damaged them. Not sure how I did it. It was a solo run. I did skip the pipes part and did alot of hacking and picking.
---
I don't see why we even need a stash limit. it just feels restrictive and annoying
---
Highest enemy level is 100, weapon levels haven’t changed
---
Gameplay over “ realism” in a damn game with super mutants and ravaging lizards of death, ty.
---
I was thinking gold bullion could be what you win. Pull the slot handle and either junk comes out, or if you hit a jackpot you get a few bars.
---
Try better inventory too, those two are my essentials, I won’t play after a patch until they’re updated :p
---
So screwed up. The Whole lot of it. Never coming back to this flaming pile...
---
I’d rather have the dog track aka Mardi Gras casino in cross lanes
---
I 100% feel that. As a level 319 I rarely show up to the SBQ fights anymore cause it’s just gotten so stale, it’s entirely RNG based now if she lands and now apparently everyone is going to be doing significantly less damage to her overall? It’s not making the game more fun to shoot at something more and use more ammo.
---
*through
---
Look man, this game is already way too easy. You never expect to one shot lvl 91 legendary glowing deathclaw. This isn't fun man. We need overall damage nerf and we need further nerf on blooded to balance out the builds. And you saying nerf isn't needed cause this game's a pve game doesn't make any sense to me. Why is World of Warcraft coming up with pve balance patches weekly then? Not just WoW but all the other MMOs? Never played ESO so have no idea how bethesda handle it in that game but keeping pve unbalanced sounds like a bit of a negligence
---
Thank you for you contribution, Citizen. Here's a coupon for an expired Lunchable.
---
You lost all interest because Beth balanced your build a little bit ?  
---
If i go to a SB Fight and she dies in seconds its not really fun. The same for other Enemys in the World. Or even PvP, you can forgett it without being forced to play another build.  
---
It didnt got "wiped" out of the map. Its just not as much op then before.   
---
The same conversation like in WoW since years. One Class is not at number one in dps its directly trash.
---
Doing the Score dailies then hopping all the events praying to win the lottery with each one for rare outfits.
---
This is true when I wanted to try something new other then my PA heavy main. I switched back to my main because he is much more effective in most if not all situations.
---
Another vault raid situation. 5% will love this. The rest and me will try once and never again.
---
Want me to invite you or you invite me?
---
EDIT: someone just launched a nuke so you can either join me or wait 20 mins or so
---
The down voters are mostly Bethesda accounts doing damage control - do not apologize to that shit!
---
Look for the low ages, and general fo centric posting on those accounts- dead give away.
---
I already didn’t have interest in this game. I literally only play the dailies to finish out the board. If you notice the words “I’ve been wanting to stop playing and I only got on to do the dailies so I could finish the Season.”
---
My build killed it after 25 minutes. It’s not going to one shot a fucking Queen. It’s made of fucking knives. And that was only the most powerful knife available. I never use that. The whole point was to run around and use a knife at random. That’s why I collected them. That’s why it was fun. Now only the strongest knife in the PTS can do decent damage to enemies because it does less than the normal knives I use outside of the PTS
---
If your placing crops down on foundations/floors which are connected to others, it can create otherwise avoidable conflicts and dependencies. For the best result with farmable tiles you will want to set them aside individually and plant them, before assembling them as a garden. If you are planning to attach any fencing, then do it after the planting crops, as this will also block planting.
---
In my experience you can fit four gourds on a 2x 2 tile by placing them towards each each of the four corners to form a circle shape. It will still take some time to get placement right, but it is definitely do-able.
---
He’s a Bethesda account man.  1yr old, and no karma...
---
No reward seems exciting to grind for and also how much has to be catered to new players? They need to give the long lasting players something sometimes ffs
---
How long does it take to go through the terminal commands to get a decent amount though?
---
I finally got it 2 days ago so it was still available then.  Its just a grind.
---
But they nerf everything. Not just the super OP stuff. For Bethesda difficulty is bulletsponges. I really hope this does not go live like this.
---
That's what this game need to be! More Grindy!  
---
Yawn.
---
All that budget though...
---
Is that Gauss minigun any good?
---
Is that in the PTS or is that current high level? I haven't come across anything that high.
---
Players in general are super OP
---
Agreed. They can't change the engine now anyway. The engine, its Unreal with modifications, make it very simple to use. However, its 20 years old. There comes a point when it is time to move on and begin making things with a better engine. Unreal does have its limitations, its 20 years old. They could upgrade to a newer version for the new consoles. Will they? Time will tell. Unfortunately though, the limitations of the engine and servers are exactly why this game currently has and will always have bugs and issues. It is beyond stressed running this game. 
---
Also, being easy to use and flexible also means it is easy to break and manipulate. There are tons of loopholes and people know a lot of them because the engine is, again, 20 years old. 
---
Amazing if you think about what they have done with it though... Really makes you wonder what it could be if the time would have been taken to start fresh on a newer engine and get better servers. I hope the next, if there is one, iteration of FO is on a newer engine. Would love to see the game jump graphically instead of just being slightly more polished than the previous.
---
A bunch of whining. Stop crying that you have to buy cookies because you don't have time to bake.
---
There should be 2 push to talk keys. One for general area and one for the team.
---
Uh, both? They're technically one and the same. Most of Tactics is non-canon, but Bethesda kept the bit about a rogue faction near Chicago that crash-landed there in airships.
---
Random People : We want a nerf! 
---
Beth : Here’s a solution to the main underlying problem with exponential  damage increase.
---
Random People : No not that kind of nerf!
---
I have the serum for it I just haven’t really bothered issuing mutations or jet packs for my build.
---
Clearly you've never seen Al Chestbreach
---
All I know is unless you buy out, you won't finish the legendary run
---
I’d think 50 bullion would be more reasonable, given that you can only earn 200 a day with notes and buy 300 per week from Smiley.  The daily limit should probably be four, as well.
---
Being able to spend all your daily bullion for an hour of double xp seems a lot more reasonable.
---
For a one hour buff, even adding in the small, random bonus effect, it seems overpriced.
---
Dude moves a space a day. You gotta get done before him.
---
This was news to me too ... Even though I've played fo76 for more than 2800 hours! Just press the back button (B on XBox)  and hold it to immediately exit the terminal. So simple once you know that 🤓
---
Indeed ! I’d say without using magic weapons it takes anywhere from 1-3thousand rounds of ammo in a queen fight...now if it takes 3-6 thousand [ just speculation no proof] for the same old rewards I’d definitely think twice before doing any event that takes that kind of resources.
---
Yeah I’m fine with it in concept. They’ve got some weird issues to balance out though; unarmed is heavily nerfed relative to the others, and something happened to melee weapons with energy damage (it’s like 40% as much as on Live)
---
I’ve been playing my bloodied HW/Explo main on the PTS. yeah, damage is quite a bit lower, but it’s fine, I was doing absurd damage as it was. My junkie’s unarmed build got cratered though; I switched to using a super sledge because it barely lost any damage (used to use a JSS power fist; now a JSS super sledge).
---
Perhaps make it a goal to repair all three nuclear power stations.  Start with Poseidon, the easiest but longest map.  Then move to Monongah and Thunder Mountain.  Thunder Mountain has the toughest enemies, but a shorter map.  Only real reward is the satisfaction of doing it.  Sometimes you have to make your own fun.
---
I’m all for a damage nerf, everything being one shot is boring as all hell. I just got done with an SBQ where I watched a melee guy just completely melt her from almost 100% health to dead in less then 10 secs from her landing. I get that endgame stuff is supposed to feel powerful but when you have no risk in any enemy you take on then what’s the point?
---
It doesn't even need to be a new tab, just being able to sort by type would be helpful.
---
Sounds like it is the fix, especially if doing slightly more damage than they anticipated the top end to be is the main issue.
---
That’s kind of a bummer.  I’ve been waiting for it to go to game pass and I started playing ASAP.  Am I gonna miss out on anything dope?
---
To expand, “dude” is the other spaceship on the board,
---
Take the L
---
That’s because each strength stat is not multiplicative now. it’s additive.
---
What does PTS stand for?
---
that doesn't change anything I said. they made a genuine argument, that games are supposed to be fun, that Fo76 is essentially just a coop game and it's silly to nerf things in something that doesn't even have a competitive scope, that people calling for nerfs could always not play the meta, but now people who did enjoy being op have no option but to play with a weaker build.
---
did you address any of it? no, you did not. you essentially just called them a coward ('it’s fine if you don't like a challenge/sense of accomplishment') and that there was no need to get defensive over it ('No need to get defensive').
---
except you didn't even say that to their face. you used semantics to offend them, avoid having to address any of their criticism and even defuse the situation, all in one paragraph.
---
I should congratulate you, actually. it usually takes a degree in PR to be this disingenuous. if I didn't know better, I'd say you're the guy who writes the ITV articles.
---
I did it solo back when game first came out. Took a long time but did it. Then I just launched my second nuke three weeks ago. Lol I blew through it that time. But playing game for two years I just started to mess around with builds and perks to get better damage. So this last time I was more knowledgeable when it came to it. If you’re on Xbox I can help you I have 20 nuke cards
---
When fo4 was newish, I was drinking one day and put a whole bunch of support tickets in to Bethesda because I couldn’t romance dogmeat and it angered me.
---
How much would that cost lol? Sounds like a lot.  Also, would it even be worth it?
---
Yes! Any build you spent a long time on is going to hell!
---
I use a v gatling gun, slower fire rate but still keeps me alive during fights.
---
It's more for the sneak bonus as a set, but it's definitely better for a melee build.
---
May i possibly get names of them. I can see one is called Mortimer
---
I get melee was hit hard. Hope Bethesda give melee builds something as a compensation but let's not try to negate the whole effort Bethesda is trying to make by focusing on some of the neglected builds
---
If you look at the ships on the pass it indicates how far you are (orange ship). Zorbo's ship is the green one. Each day his ship moves up one space. How ever many spaces his ship has from the end of the board is your timeframe. I'm too tired to English right now, sorry.
---
What loss? I'm on 88 and should finish a couple of weeks early.
---
Pay for the L, lol. You're the one that ain't getting any cake.
---
litteraly the only thing good is the power armour display
---
I think it's 150 atoms per singular stage. You can check out the rewards and such by hovering over each square on the gameboard.
---
I'm at stage 69 and I don't even think I'll make it
---
You can just camp right in front of the Queen in that.
---
I love the lunchbox domino effect at SBQ fights. Someone opens one, then someone else opens three in a row, then everyone starts opening all the ones they have. You check your Effects tab and there's like 30 things active.
---
Thanks!  That helped a lot!
---
Mortimer the Mr Handy is the raider vendor. The settler vendor is named Samuel.
---
I'm staying as well...til the game drops an expansion that allows us to camp/travel  "Nuka World Florida" or early New Vegas then see ya west Virginia! But joking aside I'm staying with the game, just platinumed it a couple weeks ago!
---
Damn.
---
Ah that reminds me of good ole New Vegas. Such a great game. But yes I would to see some sort of gambling aspect.
---

---
I think spiders would be a wonderful addition - though, there are enough options that choosing one or two variants to add could be difficult.
---
Black widows with crazy poison damage, wolf spiders that are just massive, orb weavers that shoot webbing with a slowing effect (kind of like the cryolator)... they could get pretty crazy.
---
I'm also hoarding dogtags and have been for over 6 months now. I'm hoping they'll be useful in future content.
---
I'm not sure that I'm going to participate in season 2. my schedule at work is changed and logging in more than once or twice a week isn't really going to be feasible.  If all the rewards were weekly as in the dailies added up to be the weekly I might be okay with having a marathon on my day off.  But as it stands now I don't see a reason to make time in my daily routine to play everyday if the second season is anything like the first.  I would just as soon go back to Atoms as a reward and put a few more things in the store.  Obviously this doesn't fit with bethesda's outlook for the game because it doesn't encourage frequent play nor does it encourage real money spending.  I just think that as people's quarantines end and they go back to work there should be a way to participate without daily play.
---
We can only hope that like horses no spiders survived the nuclear holocaust
---
Yeah it also shows how great this community is, a lot is shared from my experience and these interactions are just loads of fun in my opinion, I had the lunchboxes on a hotkey so I can join in quicker \^\^
---
Well you'll just have to understand that people are not going to fully believe you. 
---
For example I'm sure aliens exist, but if you told me about how you seen one I wouldn't believe you with out at least a bit of proof.
---
There are more then enough examples where those Weapons do more then enough and decent damage to Enemys. Not to mention that this is not really a problem on Bethesdas part if someone wants to use lower tier Weapons forever. Makes new loot and Gear useless. Killing any sort of progression in a RPG to please some Players who love to run arround forever with a old Kitchen Knife (for example) is a really strange idea.
---
you do realize the first half of your post is 101% subjective, right? a lot of people enjoy one shooting things.
---
and the second half, well, that's my point. WoW is a fully fledged mmo. both its developer and the community sees it that way. same with ESO. but that's not the case with Fo76.
---
Fo76 is more akin to a singleplayer game that can be played in coop mode rather than a mmo.
---
Me, polishing my shiny Gauss Pistol: Pfft. Amatuers.
---
The damage changes are required to make balance changes necessary to the game.  You need to be able to mathematically control your changes. It’s a lot easier to control multiple additive effects instead of multiple multiplicative effects so they’re on the right track. 
---
The problem is usually teams implement these changes along with sweeping balance changes so that they can at least keep the player experience consistent or fun.  Instead players got a fat damage nerf and it sounds like mobs got to be scaled up to level 100 even (a buff to some mobs).  
---
The biggest part of the problem is that the devs have a track record of gutting something and then not doing anything about it for a year.  See: twoshot / twoshot explosives
---
There was a way to repair weapons above 200% by use of the GM glitch. Having 100 INT and other bonuses on you could achieve that large condition bar. When this happened the game doesn’t register the gun’s condition. You could tell if it worked if when you repaired to “200%” it didn’t gain that thinner yellow line in the condition bar and didn’t lose durability. 
---
In all likelihood the weapon is duped and had that effect on it. I mean you traded BE15 shotgun for some crap gear you should have seen the red flag. That being said nothing is different about the gun. There isn’t a reason not to use it.
---
I had actually done this as well.
---
That said, I think the bigger problem comes from Unyielding.  Once you get used to its unmatched sneakiness, the bonus AP, the carry weight, etc., you sort of resign yourself to the idea that you're low-health anyway.  After all, they aren't giving us more Stash space, so what am I supposed to do to make up for that, what, 150 WT difference?
---
In case you don’t know, you can click on the reward icons to get a preview. I started late too but I’m determined to get the Jangles the monkey backpack, even if I have to spend atoms
---
I remember Todd Howard mentioning one of the reasons they don't want to change the engine is because it's very mod friendly, and to be honest for the most part I don't care what engine Bethesda uses for their singleplayer games, because no matter how buggy or broken they are mods will always be an option, but 76 is a different matter since it's a multiplayer game and so far doesn't have any mod support, but If at some point Bethesda finally come to their senses and get a new engine either one they've made themselves or one that they bought and modified there is potential to port 76 to it, I've seen this kind of thing before on a smaller scale for 7 Days to Die and on a massive scale for Bohemia's Standalone DayZ, it would be close to remaking the whole game so I don't think Zenimax would be willing to invest on such a thing but the potential is still there.
---
As I heard, magic weapons are not changed. Yet.
---
Just converting .38s keeps me in .45s. The UI is god awful but it does what it needs to.
---
Sounds like it'd be fun to do again, nice.
---
I took the poison resist card ASAP. Then exploding enemy kills (so far haven’t even noticed that), PA self Rez (REALLY want to max that out), Luck stats (my base luck is 6) and Endurance stats (base 3). Finished off with Ammo factory (heavy weapons are hungry, yo).
---
Don’t need to max poison resist, it’s fine at 1. Exploding enemies might be nice, higher levels I might even notice it! It’s only 10/13/16/20% though. PA self Rez is like 15/20/25/30, so not guaranteed, but pretty nice. Luck will allow me a lot more flexibility in extra cards beyond Class Freak and Starched Genes- finally add back in bloody mess? Maybe Mysterious savior in high danger situations? Ricochet that I’ve never tried out?
---
And endurance will probably end up being Lifegiver. Fits nicely in at 4 points, and as a bloodied build every HP bonus is precious.
---
Ha ha. Yes and no, but in this case, the efficacy of Bloodied was way beyond the original intent. Everyone that loves it knows how broken it is, but they enjoy playing the game on easy mode.
---
dont know if this is meant to be a joke or not but i'll take it as a compliment! :D
---
This is a very underrated and often ignored complaint/suggestion.  before changing any damage modifiers the underlying issues with damage in general need to be repaired.  I don't think you can make a good assessment of how to alter damage if your enemies are still rubber banding with a good portion of the current setup.  while I'm sure most people feel this way I feel like this complaint specifically is one of the more valid and addressable ones in the sense that if we're going to put time into working on damage a significant problem should come before an alteration.
---
How does that explain unarmed being like 50% of what it was, 1h being like 75%, and 2h basically unchanged? Nah, they did Something else.
---
Can you imagine FO76 as designed by the people making suggestions? What a goddamn nightmare.
---
I have asked this very same question and I was told they still work. Though, to be fair, I did no research of my own and the guy who answered didn't provide explanation or source.
---
Love this. Now i’ll be able to get the chicken coop.
---
I only go to SBQ fight to get free flux. I am lazy to craft my own. I am sitting 250+ from each type, but one can not have enough of them...
---
I did know that! I’ve looked through most things the the power armor skin at the end and the costume at 98 were things I wanted.  I only have 1700 atoms lol.  Also, Happy Cake Day!
---
You can wall it off anyway you want you can still pass through doors and walls. You only safe bet is to remove them. Maybe six months ago a similar issue happened that allow players to buy items in your stash (not for sale) at Vendor Bot prices. Witnessed it happen first hand to my best friend. We pulled everything! I was told it was related to having any display in you camp. I removed those displays and never had problem. This may be a whole new glitch but walls won't save you. Put you goodies your not using on a mule or remove your vendors.
---
You have to manually change the different chat options  under audio settings ingame
---
They said they were going to return this.
---
I see you are at the comic book store with a case of dry mouth
---
great looking comic book store, lots of attention to detail, everything is visible from the register to deter shoplifters
---
Do it!
---
Butterfly shrimp, to be specific
---
if you haven't done the repair X specific weapon/armor, you can blow through the kits by double dipping because you can apparently repair an undamaged weapon with an improved kit. First, repair with regular kits. Then immediately repair with improved kits.
---
I loved the slot machines in Borderlands 2. Something like that but for plans and bullion chances would be fun. Purveyor is already a lot like that, but it’d be nice to have something to waste caps on.
---
Exactly, and it seems like they’ve taken away that sense of accomplishment in your build when you do show up to the SBQ fight and are doing extreme amounts of Damage. Like the other day my friends were on their low level characters and someone triggered Scorched Earth do they went to get XP for their love levels while I continued to decorate my CAMP (priorities right?) after about 20 minutes I hear them going “oh God I don’t think they can take it down it just regen’ed Epsilon can you come help?” So I pop in my Strangler and FT over there and then help everyone take down its remaining health in 5 minutes. Yet now because everyone wants it to be ‘balanced’ it’s alienated plays who took a lot time and craft their build to allow them to do those amounts of damage to things.
---
Obviously Bethesda is trying to change the game into a coop mmo by the looks of it. Public teams, ops, raids, so on and on. I couldn't care less how you want to classify the game as but letting people one shot everything cause some people like it does not seem like a right way to go
---
i hope it does myself, i hope it pushes us to team up more, rely on things like pumpkin grenades since that would not be part of the multiplicative bonuses, have a support player with syringer that increases damage a target takes. i’m looking at this as a way to hopefully shake up game play. not a bunch of half dead snipers...this is coming from a bloodied commando
---
Lol. Siiiiigh.
---
Some builds have it easier than others though.  .45 is a particularly "expensive" ammo type to craft (resources vs. quantity) and the ammo maker is sluggish about producing it.  But it's also what fuels most of the best Rifleman options, like the Lever Action.  For Gunslingers, .44 is kind of the same way.  You can get 10mm like crazy, but .44 has a really lousy generation ratio.
---
I chambered my BE Sniper Rifle for .38 to spread the burden, because that's one of the ammo types that's quickly produced by the ammo maker.  That used to be able to one or two-shot the turrets in the silo.  Now, it takes 5-6.
---
Someone made a UI mockup for this last year and ladydevan forwarded to to to the devs. Yet here we are...
---
Really odd, cause the default is caps lock, I've never bothered to change it
---
I used to log into GTA V just to play a round of golf because unlike a regular golf sim if I got super unhappy about a shot I could just exit out and start literally shooting (with guns).  I would love to see a way to play a round at White springs possibly after a clear the enemies style quest.  You could make the clubhouse instanced that way the course would be cleared out for people to play.  you could add all sorts of interesting mini golf style post-apocalyptic hazards.  I really like this idea but I seriously doubt it's going to get implemented.
---
Purge them with fire like the Mist movie.
---
I can support that, those who don't want to spend the time getting the LR complete still have opportunities for key items later.
---
Yep.
---
I never tested how effective poison resistance was. Is the first rank really all that’s needed?
---
That’s a great idea I think it is unfair for new players to miss out on things like the ammo converter when it is such a useful item. The ammo converter gives mini nukes and missiles a purpose (assuming you can carry them home)
---
That VATS melee AoE legendary perk looks pretty cool, but I never noticed it trigger when I was trying to use it. Downsides of being a full health build with a super sledge I guess- not a lot of AP, high AP usage, and enemies weren’t that close together very often in a group event. Still, at max rank it looks boss- it scales up fast! 20/30/40/50% chance is pretty nice.
---
is that smarter every day?
---
Ooohhh shoot that's a super good idea! Cheers Beth. At least I don't need to worry so much about missing out on rewards.
---
Honestly, nothing from the datamine really appealed to me.  The greenhouse building set is kinda neat, but I’m not much of a building enthusiast and will likely never use it.  I typically like skins, and all the commie/murica stuff is really not my style.
---
Plus.....ANOTHER handmade skin.  I swear they have an employee who’s only job is to create handmade rifle skins.
---
I wish someone would do that on pc too.
---
The glowing shrooms always give me dry mouth lol
---
I think it would have been better if they implemented this global nerf as they have and just let it play out for a bit, without introducing the significantly more bullet-spongey enemies in One Wasteland.  It's really the one-two punch of both that's going to feel like a punch to the gut, if these current values go live.  Because not only are you burning through more ammo to deal with your basic Lv. 68s, but you're finding the stronger enemies in a lot more places as well.
---
I feel that, though I prefer farming for it cause nuking Morgantown and just killing mobs of Glowing Ones is more entertaining for me, than just listening to Appalachia Radio while standing on some dude’s survival tent waiting for her to land.
---
Most of the suggestion I see are just not gonna happen because Bethesda designed it to be that way on purpose which sucks but it is what it is
---
This title made me question whether food and apparel were in the same tab
---
PITA?
---
I whack the nuke over v9 now and fast travel to the forest. Had a lot more joy with her landing more often.
---
People used to yap hard when tses got nerfed. They are still playing. Some community outrage is to be expected with every balance patches but Bethesda gotta do what they gotta do
---
But that’s part of their job to deal with those type of people
---
It does de stabilize I’ve crashed the game twice using them and that was on a private world
---
It hasn't been proccing for me either.
---
I do that mostly with one stars in the horde, because they look the same as diseased to me. 2 and three stars i can usually tell with the glow about them. Still, they are a bit weak and need a decent buff for all participating. Either check ore or total damage in area and if you are in the event and have one of those two going on, you get loot.
---
Theres really no need to be rude. People that spend money on things they enjoy don't lack common sense. For the record I'm level 90 and haven't bought a level and don't plan to. But it's 15000 atoms to buy the whole season, that's only two or three hours at work for me. On the other hand, I rarely have more than 1 hour to play each day, so I understand the people that spend the atoms.
---
I already have all the new loot and gear. Why do you think I started collecting knives? This is what I did to give myself something fun to do after I got the top of the line everything. It also was the most fun I’d ever had playing this game and it just got cut in half. You’re of the mindset that everyone should have to have some form of steep hill to climb. But some people don’t like that. If players wanted to they would’ve removed some perk cards and nerfed themselves. I even started running around fists only to give myself a new challenge because it was enjoyable. But at the end of the day I could go back to what I loved most. Nerfing all existing damage decides that they’re going to force the new challenge on you, whereas before I could choose to do it myself. I could choose what was fun to me, and so could literally everyone else. Now it’s low damage or nothing
---
E: I have to be at minimal health while enemies tank more damage and do more damage and I do way less. Killing big entities isn’t easy or likely anymore without dying at least once since they now withstand so much of the damage. Lower level enemies (meaning level 100 scorched or mutants) can still die in a few seconds (only with the Bloodied knife, using their associated prefix just wont deal enough damage before I’m overwhelmed now, making all but 4 of my knives obsolete) but again this is close up bloodied melee with no health to give
---
perhaps, if that's the direction they want to go towards. let's wait and see what the community has to say about it, though. because whichever direction they pick, it's irrelevant if the people playing your game dislike it.
---
but in its current/past form, nerfing things so people don't one shoot them is a silly as nerfing, say, explosive in Fo4. not to mention I'm sure people are still able to one shoot things.
---
😂 every build has the potential. Keep crying.
---
Build another character you can do drops at a friends camp as long as he or she stays in that server your drop will be there for your net character. Keep in mind of the server reset and getting booted this will cause your stuff to go bye-bye. I know this is not the best solution but it will help in the long run. As to bigger stash limits its a server thing the more they let us have the more the server will have to load every time you log on and every time you fast travel back to your camp there engine cant handle it.
---
It also shares effects to others in a large area
---
A points over there emote..... I ended up one shotting when 5 others took a turn and i thought everyone tagged. Hit once and it killed him (3* mole miner) then the 6th guy shows up and thumbs down because he did nt tag.
---
I won't do the queen anymore if its going to mean 5000+ rounds of ammo.  I can already burn through 3k with a primed gauss gat and that ammo isn't easy to replace.
---
The run will end sometime early mid September.
---
With that amount of time you’ll make it to around 70 or so if you log in daily.
---
Or explosive bait all over it.
---
You should try Borderlands 2:P
---
DraaaaaaaaaammmmmaaaaaaaA
---
Easier then it was.

" In [Fallout 76 patch 1.3.3.24](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_patch_1.3.3.24), the AmmoPoint capacity was raised from 2000 to 100000, with additional options of being able to buy and sell 10x and 100x more ammunition to all ammunition types."
---
Switch to sunkissed during the day, pull all their rads and kill their damage output.
---
Yup. At least vs existing enemies. Hell even a single legendary armor piece at 25 is huge.
---
Most poison effects in the game are between 1 and like...10hp a second. But it is otherwise unresistable damage. For bloodied builds it was a huge threat because often they’d only have ~40hp when at &lt;19% Health.
---
25 poison resist drops even 10hp a second down to like... 4 or something. Massive massive change. So 50 is way more than we need vs anything currently in game.
---
I’ve had it proc a few times on a junkies gatling laser, which has less than 200 rof, but only on rare occasion.  I think lag or packet loss may contribute to the magic effect.
---
Now we just need a skin to fix the 10mm submachine gun sight.
---
Well, it wasn’t throw away gear. Just not gear for my build. Total gear value was like 15-20k caps, give or take...but yeah, certainly under what a B / E Shotgun would go for.
---
Thanks for the clarification. I just want to make sure it’s nothing account banning or whatever.
---
I know they mentioned several mutations on the patch notes. However, when you have a Daily op arise, does it tell you ahead of time which mutation is in effect? Or do you have to go in blind and find out for yourself?
---
I'd like bigger nerfs to be honest, to the point where even the most veteran players have to take at least 3 shots to kill a high level super mutant. Bethesda doesn't want to upset people it seems, they are being too soft on nerfs. We'll see how it turns out
---
I have a tinfoil hat for sale if you're interested.
---
I feel bad when I don't properly switch weapons or try to bash and don't and end up one shotting legendaries.  I'm glad they added the sorry emote
---
Beer steins, surprisingly.
---
....... Beer steins......
---
Then don't play.
---
I think I’m OK with this. It gives new players a way to catch up on past seasons, takes out some of the season FOMO, and shows the bullion market has a future.
---
played and beat that game. it’s fun but it’s lacking the survival and building aspect of 76
---
Competent being key here....
---
You think so? What’s the best way to level it up? I still haven’t figured that out? Is it just daily and weekly challenges?
---
Im... Dumb
---
When Gwent was in its closed beta it was so good. They completely changed it before it released. It wasn’t just cards that were changed but the entire game. It sucks now.
---
Sounds amazing. Imo I would rank it once I have nothing else to rank. But that’s a distant future. Probably would just rank it once since the first rank is pretty cheap.
---
I came up with the same system, cellphone pic.
---
this can easily be made at home. my intuition just tells me you’re an asshole.
---
Fortnite is still there for you :-)
---
PTS. I believe Earle is actually higher (105 or 110), but for general enemies 100 is the new highest
---
I did not call them a coward. Go troll somewhere else.
---
Yes, yes to all of that.  It needs to support teams so I can be your caddy.
---
massive? massive? Did you see the "nerf" to bloodied? Like actually see it in action? Every single shot was hitting for 160+ on a sheepsquatch. Automatic rifle as well. That's still silly OP. 
---
This game is way too easy even when not playing bloodied. I welcome the changes.
---
how about cough cough cough how about TRYING TO PLAY GAME OTHER THAN SAME STEALTH COMMANDO BUILD OR BLOODIED MELEE BUILD
---
It works now, so funny
---
No worries. If you need further advice on what to put on weapon racks or best place to put a floor mat feel free to ask.
---
Yea but the mods are just tools. The people who actually made good, award winning/game changing, mods for the previous FO titles know how to work the engine. They would and could learn a new engine just as easy. My point is, the mod friendly comment is irrelevant and was more an excuse as to why a new engine hasn't been introduced since the beginning of 3D 1st person FO titles. 
---
Your comment on 76 being a different animal is 100% correct. 2 years down the road and the promised "mods are coming" are still not here. The honest truth is mods, at least ones like previous titles, on an online only game would break it. People would have everything and there would be no reason to grind thus no reason to sign in everyday. 
---
I hope the next gen consoles will fuel the desire to finally breed a new engine for the FO franchise. It is my favorite franchise as nothing else really matches what you can do in them, especially 76 and 4. Sadly I was hoping for this when the current gen consoles were released and was let down. Maybe, just maybe next gen will bring change. Until then I choose to just accept that this game will always be broken, it will always have quirks, but I will continue to play strictly because of the people I have met because of this game.
---
This! So many people are saying that it’s fine, and bloodied builds are just complaining, but this right here is why this thing is so bad.
---
Player icons are a piece of...
---
It tells you. The Op shows up on the map screen, when you click on it it has its own little UI with full details and a join button at the bottom.
---
it's part of the next patch
---
Line in the sand with lunch boxes and tent glitch
---
I agree.  It should be available to everyone.  
---
After the “fix”, I never use the thing.  It’s geared towards hoarders now, not the guy who presses Loot All on a Whitespring run and wants to turn in small quantities of random ammo later.  I can’t remember what I have while in the menu, so it’s not worth the effort for a few lousy points.
---
You can just pop them out and fix the in the same room and not have 15lbs of extra sh#t to carry. No need to look for them.
---
For sure you never got a good weapon thats why you are so happy with these changes!
---
Dailies weeklies and events. Especially the queen.
---
I want our atom challenges back, not reskins of stuff they've previously sold in the shop.
---
Earle? Is that the Wendigo Colossus?
---
I would rather see gradual balance changes than big sweeping nerfs. People that grind and trade for end game gear suddenly having the build be mediocre is going to make them not want to play. I would rather see other prefixes get buff to make more builds viable before a big overall damage nerf.
---
Along with plans I've learned.  Why are they prioritized?
---
not to their face you didn't, that's my point. perhaps you didn't mean that specifically, although I doubt it. but you certainly meant something negative by 'it’s fine if you don't like a challenge/sense of accomplishment, no need to get defensive'.
---
you also continue to ignore my/their points, but at least you stopped trying to defuse the situation. so that's something, I guess.
---
Even the other games though. Like Fallout 4 was most useful with that stuff, but Fallout 3 and NV I did that as well. Guns in one box, armor in another, useless misc items in a box, misc items that are useful for repeatable quests in another, food in a box, etc. Just found stuff, brought it back, sorted it out, repeat.
---
They're shrimp
---
That’s the best now. 
---
The next best is to use full unyielding with food buffs for the repeatable challenge.
---
During double XP would be the best time to spam lunch boxes but I don’t think we’ll get one now since we already had one this run.
---
Technically you could reach rank 100 if you no life it but that would take awhile. double XP was the best chance to push ranks quick.
---
You have to repair 15 cores to open the last door, or just phase through the wall.
---
This season ends in 24 days, I imagine there will be buffer between them. I suppose it’s safe to guess mid-late September?
---
You're a genius, I'm gonna start doing this.
---
50% is a massive number my guy
---
This makes sense until you scrap the first thing in the list.
---
you want help on pc for nuke ? if you want i can help you. i nuke 9 times mins/day
---
What is the purpose of lunch boxes? Lol
---
I’m using this post as my own Q&amp;A
---
the skins are equipped in the atom shop.
---
What steins are currently available?
---
Key ring and holotape tab.
---
Item favoring that let it stay at the too of a list.
---
Changing the colors of the hud.
---
Well the hammer swings both ways. If a low level goes anywhere it lowers the enemy level to match. But, for me which is going to make it fun. Is everywhere I go the enemies will level match to me. Which is a higher level enemy. Don't get me wrong I Love easy enemies. But to finally have that challenge again. I may have to fight level 100s now. That's challenging and a blood bath. It's boring to walk around the forest with my low level friends. I'm not bothered by level 5 scorched. My interest in this is how do the loot tables scale? Wil a level 5 jump into the encryptid event and still get the fixer plan? Easier? I hope not. If you play below level 50 I think you should get squat. Sorry but you shouldn't get the same prizes that a high level player has vested in. That would ruin the game. Level 5 grinding SBQ gets a 3 star legendaries level 50 heavy weapon. Rare Ultracite plans? (Hehe mostly calibrated shocks and emergency protocols. Still waiting for those lol) I'd like to see how the loot tables work. Maybe when I do SBQ I don't get a damned 1* rolling pin/shovel. Veterans need a little love too. I say keep the level matching. Loot though may be another problem.
---
Well this is something I didn't think would need explaining.
---
You're so welcome.   I'm glad I could help.
---
I am not been rude, but I guess that is subjective. As I said and if you actually read properly what I said which you clearly didn't. Play as much as you can and if we get to the end of the season and people will to level up, go for it, I have no real issue with that. But buying your way up and then claiming your did it or buying your way now and not actually even waiting until Sep is silly. So for you play your 1 hour a day and when we get close to the end of the season you decided to use your free atoms or to buy your way to level 100, I really would not have a issue with that even though I wouldn't do it. My example of a guy spending $150 just to get a secret door is plain stupid .. sorry no cosmetic is worth $150 whether you got money or not. The real issue is when Bethesda sees white whales doing exactly this, they think everyone will which is BS ..  doesn't matter one way or another to me as the rewards are lame. 
---
Take a look at Season 2's rewards, they pathetic ..
---
Lunchboxes are new items that you receive via the legendary run. Each time you open one you receive a 25% increase to XP up to 100%. It was very effective during 2x xp
---
I also heard you could buy them for 100 gold bullion each in a future update.
---
Oh I have used it since the patch, I know it's a bit better than it was.  My experience of it is still poor though.  Is it significantly better when you have a "system" so to speak?
---
Can we wait until it is out of PTS before we lose our collective minds.
---
Using a PS4 Pro here, I can confirm that the frame rate is still an issue. From what I can gather it seems to be a 'container' issue relating to the meat/scrap piles that enemies turn into when they die.
---
Seems there used to be a limit on them so old piles would despawn to make room for new ones, this doesn't seem to be the case anymore and hundreds of piles accumulate causing issues on the server. This is just me speculating though so take it with a grain of salt.
---
Either their own tabs, or a way to "sort by."  Whichever is easier to code, Beth.
---
Oh okay. Thanks!
---
Two lunchboxes a day if you arn't in need of buying anything else.
---
Guess this is where I exit if this makes it off the PTS without some major enemy rebalancing. Having to shoot a single super mutant 76 fucking times to bring them down just isn’t my idea of a good time, idk about y’all.
---
Public Test Server. Basically they let players into a test server to try out new content before releasing it into the live game (see https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/72tNixuDqBoHEVDsI3Dc29/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-pts-a-colossal-problem-and-meat-week-begin-soon). Seems to be PC-only.
---
You wish it was only one year
---
Looooooool!!!!!!!!
---
I absolutely did not mean anything negative. I meant exactly what I said. It **is** fine if they don’t want a challenge. Everyone has their own wants from a game. It’s not a bad thing. 
---
Again go try and pick a fight with someone else.
---
Can you pass through doors and walls if there's something on the other side of them?  Honest to God, I don't have it in me to keep pulling stuff in and out of  vending.   If I have to do this as many times as there are glitches and exploits, I will probably just stop vending.
---
Can't you just server hop if you don't like the enemy perks?
---
even if you're telling the truth, you're still ignoring the rest of my/their post. so it's doesn't change virtually anything I said.
---
First rank is basically free. First rank of everything is free; you get 1 slot per 50 levels, max at level 300. Ranking them above 1 costs 100 perk points though.
---
Honestly they still need to reworked the legendary perk system.
---
Scrapping perks should be just a thing they add. Legendary perk points should just be “X amount per level, account wide, based on your highest level character”. It’s what they did with ESO, and totally makes sense and doesn’t screw over people who spent a lot of perks on respecing, or building different ranks of perks for different builds, etc. and it doesn’t discourage alts.
---
Yep
---
It’s “first expedition” at the beginning
---
Good question. I noticed some doors removed and display cases placed in the way. That stopped me. So maybe other objects can do this.
---
Your creativity to suggest is so limited 😅
---
Looks awesome, the arcade machine from next season will look great in there
---
Equipped items shouldn't be scrappable I feel or give a notification like almost selling favorite items. I also sortof wish we cpuld just flag what we wanna sell and then agree to it upon completion like in FO4.
---
percentages are a bad way to measure stuff tbh. 
---
If someone offered you 50% of 10 pounds or 10% of 100 pounds which would you take? 
---
What i'm saying is. If thy can "nerf" it that much and still do damage like that then they need to keep on nerfing.
---
How about not making a game mode that is basically unplayable for certain builds?
---
And I say this as a bloodied HW main, probably the build most capable to do daily ops. But I have alts covering basically every major play style in the game.
---
I care about balance.
---
Why didn’t I think of that...
---
BOTH! Haha the boys with the most toys wins!
---
Isn’t the stealth bonus also additive now though as well? 
---
If it is you’re also being nerfed... 
---
Instigating + covert ops would have resulted in 500% base damage
---
Is that now more like 350%?
---
Genuine question as I don’t play on PC, but if true you’re going to lose out big just like everyone else
---
That’s very clever, and I applaud your can-do attitude.  
---
I’m glad I play a bloody rifleman, because I cant be assed to break down dozens of weapons, craft a pile of ammo with the steel, feed it into the converter and deal with that atrocious menu system just to stay supplied.  You have way more patience than I do.
---
The bullion ammo press, ammo cans and enemy loot typically keep me from having to make .45 more than once a month.  Its great.
---
Nerfing everything the same amount doesn’t solve shit. Bloodied needed a nerf though
---
Was just reading this to my husband and he said it would be a great CAMP item, a slot machine where people can play to win the grand prize of some item you've put in the machine (which people would be able to see so they know what they're playing for) as well as some lesser-valued items they could also win.
---
Wait, if you play on multiple characters I thought it still worked as one thing? Or are you on diff consoles or something?
---
What happened to melee I've only seen ranged
---
About as limited as your grasp of correct grammar :-)
---
It is a nerf. If damage drops from everything it’s a nerf.
---
I primed a Vamp ffr gat plas just for the Queen. I agree that it's great!
---
how about 50% of 300? because that's how hard your average bloodied commando build got nerfed. the whole point of bloodied is dealing high damage.
---
Are they going to scale down acid attacks from enemies? Seem to remember them buffing it for the Vault Raids that everyone loved sooo much.. We see where that went... How about reverting the nerf to Sentinel and Cavalier Legendary Effects that happened because people cried about it on The Survival server. We see where that went... Or I know maybe they could fix whatever the hell they did to Two Shot and explosive effects that people cried about back in beta. Short answer hell no they aren't.. This is just a ruse to slow people down.
---
Server hopping as a deliberate design choice is just...
---
 Gah. I hate it. It’s terrible as a player. 
---
Also, I don’t know. Maybe?
---
You can gather the wooden or metal ones from Helvetia and there is also the fasnacht one and the jangles stein from the Legendary Run. There should be a Meat Week one coming up and another in the next season.
---
I believe it was Socrates who said 'The clothes don't make the man'
---
I'm happy with my junkies gauss shotgun. Although i do have a nice bloodied explosive faster reload lever action sitting there which will never get used. And for the record junkies should be nerfed as well. takes some fun out of the game when you can one shot most things.
---
So. bring on the nerfs!
---
Hell yeah. They’d have to be pretty big to be a threat to the existing insects, but skyrim pulled it off pretty well
---
I’m pretty sure it said 100 for 3
---
np! don’t equip it now though! it’s causing camps to break
---
Will said wendigo be wearing a western outfit and cowboy hat???
---
Agreed. I'm far from meta with my build since I started playing a few weeks ago. Using a instigating hitman weapon, if it's not a big boss, it's one shot.
---
Honestly I feel this was necessary. It would be nearly impossible to balance One Wasteland if they kept the bonuses multiplicative.
---
3 lunchboxes for a 100 gold is a steal.
---
Is there a trick to placing the reward steins jangles ect on the rack because it will not let me ?
---
I’m not ignoring anything. Anyway I’m done here. Like I said. Go troll somewhere else. Continue to write negative things about me, insult my integrity if you want.  I’m not interested in a fight.
---
No, they don’t. And you wasted your time to report someone for using a glitch that doesn’t affect your gameplay in anyway. You’re a snitch, and pathetic. Good thing Bethesda doesn’t even ban real hackers
---
Sounds fun! Jaymike27
---
It’s a PTS. Since we are reacting negatively to it, they can just disable or adjust the nerfs. It’s nothing to worry about
---
If you want a good spider experience, play Metro. Nightmare fuel
---
Yes. I’ve only launched solo. I don’t know or care to know the speed run techniques, either, as I like to farm the bots and turrets for XP. The first is the hardest as you have to learn the routine and layout, and it appears harder than it really is. But plenty of online guides and tips. And nukacrypt posts the deciphered launch codes each week, so as long as you got a keycard, supplies, and some measure of determination, it’s very doable. And it is strangely satisfying to see your little nuke fly from the nest to wreak havoc on some part of the world.
---
should be more. You don't need that much damage in this game. If it was like the division or destiny where things are MASSIVE bullet sponges and have silly amounts of health then yeah. Sweet. Let's have some massive damage numbers. People shouldn't be murdering a sheepsquatch in a second or two. It should be a nice fight where you actually have to use tactics and move and retreat and heal up.
---
Damage calculation as a whole was changed; it just hit bloodied the most as it was stacking the most damage multipliers.
---
Agree,but still if you're a pure melee or pure rifle,there are mutation that basically make you useless.
---
It’s not like most people have known this for almost two years or anything
---
AP isnt really that useful though, other than sprinting
---
Nope. Nerf bloodied.
---
Everybody agrees, but you guys posting this same thing ten times a day for easy karma is fucking annoying
---
Especially melee. Melee got a *massive* shaft.
---
It’s super useful for non stop vats
---
bloodied is way too powerful though. So buffing others is pointless because then instead of one OP build there'll be a dozen or whatever.
---
Hm? My read on that was that you can buy a lunch box for 100 gold, and they have 3 in stock. So if you turned in your max treasury notes per day you'd have 2 lunchboxes a day. Which is still a fairly good rate - you basically get 3 hours of double XP a week, so I can imagine people stockpiling during the week and then having big XP sessions over the weekend.
---
Actually, since everyone near you also gets these buffs, the community could basically make every weekend double XP weekend if people make opening lunchboxes at events like the queen fight a norm.
---
Old news! Well I read it in another post this morning. But this the internet!
---
If you look at it as a whole they closed the damage gap between bloodied and other legendaries. So in turn could be considered a buff to other legendaries.
---
War Glaive? That sounds awesome
---
Then dailies and weeklies after the legendary run should awards bullions.
---
You should craft one in the Tinkerers workbench. Its separate from the camp object.
---
you ignored literally every single one of their points and now you're ignoring me telling you that you're being disingenuous by trying to defuse criticism instead of arguing against it.
---
just read back. proof is a few posts above.
---
Bots aren't living.
---
I know, that’s why I’m saying, they need to work on rebalancing the ops so this isn’t the issue it is right now
---
Your belief is not my concern, have a good one
---
you understand that's highly subjective, right? personally I wouldn't bother with this game if that was the case.
---
not to mention gathering resources for long fights such as that is a waste of time.
---
As a follow-up, do you factor out outliers? Say if a 1* bloodied handmade normaly sells for 3,000 caps but someone reports selling one for 15,000 caps do you remove that data point?
---
This is where I take issue with these nerfs. The more devoted players are being punished for the work they've put into their build, etc, because the casuals are bitching that they can't do as much damage as them. The casuals want all the perks without any of the work.
---
Ok I’ll give it a go . I’ve got both I’ve crafted and it will let me place on objects in my camp like tables ect but not the display for the steins . I’ll see what I come up with. Thank you !
---
Hell no. I do not like spiders.
---
I'm a solo player but I hear there are discord and other places to find people to play with.
---
Random friend invites usually spell danger.
---
You found out my secret 45 ammo factory!
---
As an unarmed melee... this is annoying, but I can adapt (shotguns or heavy guns).
---
The person (and player type) I feel bad for is people like my wife--who runs Instigating/AA lever action rifles. She runs all the rifleman perks and bloodied mess, but can't one-shot a lot of enemies. The "food builds" that everyone hates on so much are just as fickle to dropping a game that becomes tedious and annoying. Rather than adjust the prefixes that needed some love, they thew everyone for a loop with this.
---
Sure... change is good... most of the time, but not when it is a unilateral neutering of damage across the board. In RPGs you expect your character to get stronger over time, and it sucks to see a reduction in performance, seemingly arbitrarily. 
---
P.S. the *real* weapons that piss people off at SBQ etc (magic weapons) aren't being fixed with this change, so it kinda adds insult to injury by allowing such a major outlier to remain untouched.
---
Thanks for the report chew, we got our best guys on it
---
If you can keep ammo made for it, yeah it's generally pretty good. There's not a significant improvement with the 5 barrel mod vs. the 3 barrel mod, if you were wondering however:)
---
I specifically searched for "war glaive" and nothing returned.
---
Probably)
---
Are you okay? Having issues at home or something?
---
Let’s be honest about this. I can murder anything that isn’t the queen or the colossus in 1-3 bullets. This adjustment needed to happen befor the legendary perk cards and any additional content. Multiplicative damage bonuses was always a bad design mistake as it allows for greater increases in damage from small changes In Bonuses. 
---
That being said, Bethesda also needs to also work on some of the effects like nocturnal and mutants and most of the specific type effects. This would give a broader number of effective builds.
---
2 - 3 mins total from 3k railway to +2000 flamer fuel
---
Yes please!
---
Lol you have literally no worries about that. You will
---
NOT be banned for owning a weapon that was duped that you had no knowledge of. Hell people who actively dupe do not get punishment. I’d say use the gun, it obv is good.
---
OK,  I think you have to actually listen to them.
---
I keep saying they need to leverage the social building aspect of the game by allowing people to place mobs in the upcoming instanced interiors. I think allowing people to build little dungeons with traps and stuff would make this game instantly awesome. Content galore, and all they have to do is sell the picks and shovels.
---
What did you do in the Division 2? The paid Season Pass is worse than Fallout's free one.
---
Yeah... They need to tune enemy scaling if there is going to be a bunch of level 100 enemies AND a damage nerf.
---
Not really. I have a 3rd character just for the score challenge level up. And i always keep it below level 20 to make sure it doesn't take too long. Takes like 5 min to level up vs. The hour or so it takes when your over 100
---
This makes zero sense. Not everything is about the atomic shop. People have been asking for balancing and nerfs for a long time.
---
Wait how? Supposedly we're a good community
---
BOS recon rifles and fixer. I craft them at lowest lvl and drop them at newbies feet with a pile of ammo.
---
They think that balances comes with constant nerfings. I nerfed my credit card.
---
2 Consoles, 4 completely different accounts .. I did it for fun, it's out of control, I have an addiction lol .. It was fun earning atoms on 4 characters and I get to have 20 camps ... I run 2 characters at the same time, it useful for many reasons such as fast traveling, grouping, the bug where you spawn at the vault ... I always play 2 together .. It's interesting that just basically doing most of the dailies, I don't do the level up's, they all around 70 ..  I really shouldn't have done the additional characters, but I wanted the extra camps.
---
*New Vegas Casinos Intensifies*
---
I mean, that much is obvious.
---
dropping ultracite ammo?  Loving that part!
---
Just so you know I go up to them and punch them for minimal damage then give a thumbs up. There are good people out there :)
---
Honestly this game is just a time killer for me. As soon as Cyberpunk comes out, I'm done with FO. It's a damn shame too. This game had a butt load of potential :(
---
But then there won’t be any point in using the Silos because it would only consist of arm launched nightmare fuel
---
Vats is such a niche thing though.
---
I've got a lv 7 character and I'm finding it harder to level him up than my lv 160 commando.
---
If you all would like a third person, I'm down to run it. Level 177 and haven't dropped a nuke yet.
---
Right? There’s a reason it’s on pts, they’ve been fidgeting with legendary perks for a while now, based on all the feedback and complaints I’m sure they’ll start fidgeting with the damage nerfs
---
If you make it an instanced event or session you can force the players to have their equipment removed... For security reasons. Therefore your armor and chems can't help you. Just wear a garment or something. Easy. DONE!
---
Oopss you got me! 🤪Lol! I can work on my grammar but Im not sure if you can do it in your creativity!
---
I don’t use bloodied much I just hope melee is still good cause it’s the only fun way to play
---
It does initially, but if you put in all your treasury notes each day it works out to 14/week - so you basically have 3 hours per week of double XP. And if people start opening these at big events like the Queen fight, we could suddenly see just about every weekend effectively become a double XP weekend. I can see why Bethesda are starting a bit cautiously here.
---
Why are you downvoting him? he’s right.
---
I’m finding there to be a little bit of dullness in the gameplay right now. Server crashes because of 20 people using two shot fat mans will spice things up
---
Please no.
---
Yep  mine did the same thing and support will not do anything
---
No, this is Patrick.
---
Sadly they are 100 each, they have 3 in stock.
---
But they are balancing the combat system. Or just nerfing a part of it to please the cries?
---
Who cares about the season pass tho, gotta get on the grind, strikers got fixed I think
---
easily
---
I just smashed cores...I never had to repair them. And I have no idea how to phase through walls.
---
Bloodied only uses about two more of those multipliers than junkies does. Both rely on about ten different multipliers for sneak builds. So really this hits every build about the same, except for really poorly conceived builds that didn't take advantage of any of the good perks or buffs to begin with.
---
Vital in a rifle or pistol build where vats headshots mean the difference between efficient one hit kills with gun fu moving from enemy to enemy and 4 hit kills and getting mobbed!
---
Bless your heart
---
Really, the ammo part is probably the thing that annoys me the most.
---
After all these hours, I had reached a point where I was basically ammo-neutral.  Spreading my needs across a couple ammo types and using the ArmCo machine, I basically never had to craft or farm resources for ammo.  And that's something I deliberately worked toward, because I *hate* farming resources for ammo.  It's tedious, I don't enjoy it, I considered it a personal victory when I overcame it.
---
Clearly, all of that goes out the window when, at a minimum, everything takes an extra shot to kill.  More often, it's 3-5.
---
So, if they go with these numbers, I think they also need to review both the ArmCo machine's production rate (which they need to do anyway - there's no reason why a top-tier ammo like 5.56 generates as quickly as it does) and the build needs/quantities of ammo.  Because we're going to burn through the ammo, believe me.
---
right after I invested in a flamethrower
---
Just happened to me as well, 2250 down the drain.  I was foolishly on during the reset as I believed the patch notes as well.  That’s 4000 gone total.  I’ll still make the goal, so my condolences to those still grinding and trying not to spend atoms.
---
This seriously worries me as a new player. I love the melee but dislike the gun play in 76.
---
Nothing different, it just has a more drastic effect on melee numbers.
---
The pioneer scouts has athletic tests that should just be run a distance in a short time but the raiders made it more interesting with bear traps and land mines. I could see something like what you described happen with golfing in FO76
---
I have three characters: one is a power armor tank who uses heavy weapons and carries a lot of fuel/cryo cells/fusion cores, another is a berserker build that uses a bow and a knife, and the last is a shotgun-using food build. When you say "You will need more bullets to kill stuff" you should be more specific as to who your message is meant for; my ammo consumption won't change at all
---
Your predictions are baseless, enemies drop ammo you hit them with now
---
I also recommend The Secret World. It isn’t a great mmo for endgame or anything but the story is AMAZING and the quests are awesome too, many having you do pretty advanced puzzles. If you havnt you should really check it out!
---
The subreddit has tried to warn people not to be on during reset
---
Yes it's a nerf but people are talking about it like it's specifically a nerf to bloodied when bloodied is still the best damage output there is
---
Fuck no.
---
This would screw with the time gate on rolling legendaries, which is ... well it would happen
---
Their weapon skins suck, look at the screaming eagle
---
What do you mean
---
I can see that placed in trap CAMPs right when your about to get flung off a cliff or die in acid
---
It’s a actually not that bad. Make a bunch of railway spikes and convert them. They gives lots of points and it only takes steel to craft.
---
We are, but there are griefers in every game. When they are your friend, they know where your camp is. 
---
Just a general warning. You also can block players for a session which is a great way to deescalate a heated situation or just server hop. Most ppl don't memorize usernames so a hard block isn't often necessary.
---
Sorry for the dumb question but what does PTS mean? 🤐
---
It’s amazing when it works.
---
Just try it, with the perk you'd kill faster
---
Because it was a waste of text that didn’t add anything to the conversation but was instead designed to insite angry responses. People are just choosing to give the post that type of response with downvotes rather than more wasted text.
---
I’ll be on tonight we can do it.
---
I'll shoot them a couple times in the gut with a low damage gun or just punch them, then sit back and let everyone else duke it out. I get that sometimes people just underestimate the damage they'll do but when it happens three times in one event by the same person it's a little obvious that they're doing it on purpose. And they'll do it so fast that I'll be in the room and can't even get up to get a shot on it by the time it's dead.
---
look in the status tab of your pipboy.
---
Antacid Is +10 Rad Resistance,

OTher lunchboxes give 25% XP bonus (they stack, BTW.)

OThers give different bonuses - lowered thirst/hunger, etc.
---
Team of 3 last night, 100% XP bonus from lunchboxes.  THe amount OF XP at Radiation Rumble was amazing..
---
I read and understood. You were rude. And people can play this game however they want. Your way isnt the "right" way. There is no "right" way.
---
Is it more efficient to wait until the end to spend atoms when the levels take more SCORE? Yes. And if you care about doing it that way go ahead. Some people don't.
---
And in your example the person didn't spend $150 dollars for a secret door. They spent it for a secret door and 99 other levels of items.
---
And those whales you are insulting are why you get Wastelanders, Seasons, a Colossal Problem, the new BOS content, etc. all for free.
---
Public test server. It's available for PC users using the Bethesda launcher only.
---
Lmao I need to do that, last time I was frantically searching like "where TF are my lunchboxes"
---
Damn.. That sucks. I just play the game normally except now i know what can give extra xp. Also take advantage of the building public team that gives +intelligence. I notice a little boost in xp for small things
---
That would be awesome for my first nuke, thanks. I am working in the Enclave promotion quest now. What's you ign?
---
I do want that chicken coop but I don't think I'll make it up there on time.
---
Serious question - how would this mode work if stealth was allowed? Wouldn’t you just never get engaged and breeze through it? Sounds like the alternative might be really boring.
---
Like... on my stealth build I can go through a missile silo without being shot at. All the content in the game can’t be like that right?
---
Why wouldn't you have nuke zones? Going through a nuke silo is easy and quick enough doing it normally.
---
Given that the majority of enemies in the game are massive bullet sponges, bloodied is really the only option when it comes to actually having enjoyable combat (especially with weapons that aren’t otherwise usable, like the laser rifle or any sort of pistol). Unless they figure out how to balance things across the board, and make it so I don’t need 200 10mm rounds to kill a single super mutant, this game will just turn into an ammo production simulator. The game already isn’t super fun, this just makes it worse
---
I mean, there's explicitly a "you have to do melee damage" mutation and another "melee kills will freeze you in place" mutation, which suit diametrically opposite builds. I think figuring out how to play an op that doesn't suit your build is sort of the point - remember that this update is also shipping legendary perks that let you have more special points, and they've put in an explicit daily ops public team. So to do an op that doesn't suit your main build you can do things like try to find other people to help you that are more suited to it, or if you want the challenge of going solo you can swap some perk cards in to re-balance your build.
---
It's an interesting design with some thought put into it - let's give it a little while in the PTS before jumping to conclusions on this one.
---
that happened to me one too many times, so I just had to do it \^\^
---
They made no changes to the round 2 set of perks themselves, just coins in this version.
---
edit: discussion thread where they say they changed coin value: https://bethesda.net/community/topic/423544/legendary-perks-feedback-and-discussion-part-3?language%5B%5D=en
---
edit2: N+D lists all the current legendary perks https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks/database
---
Enemies drop more of the ammo type you hit them with now
---
It’s a very dumb move that kills multiple birds, legendary and ‘builds’ are less attractive so fewer people will play hard to find that dream legendary and optimize their builds. Some higher level players probably will just move to other games since their hard earned (or purchased) legendaries got far less effective, and they should know anything they work toward will face the same fate in a year when the next round of nerf hits, what’s the point for the ‘grind’ at all. Nerfing is the laziest and least creative way to balance a game and Bethesda is showcasing their vacuum tube full of talent.
---
Your forgetting gold is a pain to grind for and can only get 200 a day with the occasional 300 a week if smily works. 
---
Once more and more stack up from missed runs there would to much to even buy for new players so they have to pick and choose.
---
It would take months to buy them. you could also buy the t 65 or other sets then it would an insane amount of time to even buy it. If they play that much they deserve it.
---
Anyone in an event should get credit for a kill but then you'll have people show up to events and do nothing to get free loot and xp. I get the way it is may be a good solution but it's far from the best
---
I also want more things to shoot. Server wide there should be a random spawn of large hordes. I mean like 300 to 400 random creatures with behemoths and collossi taken over by the scorched plague to seek vengeance on the vault dwellers that killed their SBQ. I want my ass kicked and my Furious Ultracite Gatling Lazer to feel exhausted at the end.
---
First, I didn't. 
---
But why did you downvote me for me expressing my view? Isn't that hypocritical?
---
Bloodied gets the benefit from way to many sources in the game. Anything that gives you a bonus based on how much damage you've taken, benefits bloodied. Not true for many other builds.
---
Bloodied gets the most, then maybe junkie. Then everything else falls way down below those. 
---
Increasing everything to be up with bloodied is a race war. And that never works out in games. That just makes everything less challenging. If a game isn't challenging, it has a short life. You don't even have to be bloodied build for a lot of the game to be easy. 
---
So, the answer isn't always, make others better, because I like being the most powerful, and I don't want to lose that. Which is really come down to.
---
Stupid that you even have to do workarounds for something like this.
---
Melee damage is typically way higher so benefit more from multiplication. The change is no different to range but the numbers will be far more noticeable.
---
Yeah I’m having the same issue. First I thought they autocompleted nu the NW is still open. Hopefully it gets fixed soon
---
Hell I’m one of those people that gave that warning as well!  Foolish me for believing patch notes...
---
My goal is to max out the legendary ammo perks immediately I can. I hate ammo grinds.
---
Yeah that's a little rough. They might tweak this, well that's why it's in testing. Just a friendly reminder you chose to play the role of "high risk, high reward" glass cannon. Metas and YouTube all to thank for that. Not hating It's just the idea behind the build is pretty cut and dry, I watch max levels get rocked at all High level events. It's what It's.
---
I never said it was necessarily a bad thing just that it's not just bloodied that got changed. It's a good starting step but they need to make some tweaks to the amount of damage you put out to increase it from here. You can't kill a max level scorchbeast anymore without it taling like half an hour. Sbq is nearly impossible even with the whole server there
---
Not only have players ability to earn atoms been impacted but now the rewards we do get are just average game content, not even atomic shop quality? Hmm
---
It is. You find the ammo type you're going to sell, select an amount and then as soon as it starts to load the next screen press the back button to jump to the prior screen. Rinse and repeat - probably takes 1/3 as much time if you actually use the interface as designed.
---
Yes I understand but there are estimated numbers for the ranged bloodied (60% nerf) and junkies(40%nerf) is there an estimated nerf for melee
---
Using all that ammo and spending 30+ mins to run a full silo and launch a nuke is not worth the reward, at all.
---
I don’t think they autocompleted, they just didn’t reset is all. My NW challenge is still open
---
I actually agree. I do all the weekly and daily challenges and i feel like i might not finish. That the only way might have been cheating. This shit gives me anxiety yo
---
This, 100%.
---
Some of the posts I've seen here lately where people are complaining they can't do reasonable damage... Then they give their build stats and it's terrible... Well no wonder.
---
It also seems like they want to give people strong incentive to discard characters and start over every time they reach 100, so they're pandering more to the new players than the veterans they think will stick around regardless.
---
I have the same issue. Never happened to me before,  just today.
---
ign radenn and pinodxb
---
pm me when you want.
---
It makes sbq essentially impossible. The enemy scaling combined with this makes some enemies just so bullet spongey it isn't worth fighting them.
---
Ah yes a skin for my skin
---
Honestly, it should be, otherwise, why bother?
---
As I understand it, FFR is unaffected in that it remains a de facto 25% boost, since it increases shots fired and doesn't act as a literal damage boost modifier.
---
The only daily I don't like is the level up one. At higher levels it can take a while, and if I'm playing a long session I will intentionally log off when I'm about to level up a 2nd time so that the next daily can be completed easily. That's not healthy for the game imo
---
The rest of them are fine and can be done in 30 mins. Most of them can just be naturally finished while just playing normally and ignoring dailies... So to the people who quit because of a completely optional thing, you got problems
---
It is kind of strange that no Fallout game has ever had mutated spiders, at least that I can remember.
---
The creatures that many people are afraid of, being spiders, centipedes, snakes and bats, have been absent from the franchise up until Scorchbeasts.  I wonder why?  I’d think that mutated versions of creepy crawlies would have been on top of the list, but maybe the devs felt they were too on the nose?  Scorpions made the cut, but I think they exist in the world as a throwback homage to the original Black Isle games.  In my lifetime as an East Coast native, I have never seen a scorpion in the wild.
---
I suppose altering previously benign critters, like crabs and deer, were a bit more interesting than just taking a snake or spider and making it 10x larger.
---
All that being said, I would definitely support the addition of mutated spiders, as well as snakes and centipedes.  The thought of a ten foot long House Centipede just makes me shudder.  They’re benevolent, but man are they fast and creepy.
---
what enemy "mutation" does that?
---
I only remove datapoints that are obvious duplicates.
---
The rest of the data points are going to be given various states depending on their relationship with other datapoints for same item and difference from our calculations.
---
We want to have feedback loop in which algorithm calculations are adjusted to price feedback and price feedback is automatically allowed/filtered out based on systems 'tolerance' and difference between feedback value and calculated value. We start with 'very loose' tolerance and will make this more strict the more mature the system is.
---
A MUCH better idea would be to have certain enemies that have high perception. Gives you a priority target, something you can have agency with as a player. 
---
As it is.... it’s basically “stealth builds not allowed, and if you’re bloodied, good fucking luck if you aren’t a HW/PA build”.
---
Rubish they also can autocomplete if your not playing. I had my weeklies autocompleted this week even when I was not on. And this week 3 times the dailies, so I’m behind the green one again
---
Yes, and the fact that outsiders believe this pleases us.
---
Agreed
---
Not exactly true. Any build can run low health and get all the benefits of bloodied except for the bloodied legendary effect. I sometimes run a low health vamp build. Get all the qol benefits of a bloodied build but sacrifice some damage for infinite healing.
---
I make a resistance lined vault suit and road leathers when I see a level 1 coming out of the vault. Those are huge boosts at the beginning
---
It wasn't bad as a PA heavy gunner, either. The damage reduction from PA, combined with lone wanderer and blocker, and the stagger/cripple from one gun army, made higher level stuff easily doable.
---
Pts stuff for the daily ops
---
per day or per server?
---
Not sure how I feel about this. What was the point of grinding The Legendary Run if we can just purchase the level rewards/items individually at Season's end? It's obviously welcomed by those who didn't bother completing or didn't have time but I now have even less reason to play next Season. I'll just wait for it to end so I can purchase the 2-3 items that would've actually been worth playing for.
---
Is the war grave a 1 or 2 handed weapon?
---
This game is not just DPS. It's just my opinion.
---
Thats actually a fantastic idea, never thought of doing the machete or the fixer chambered to .38, gonna try that later on :)
---

Nothing, your done for today
---
Not quite yet. One of the issues with that is due to the scaling going on with enemies it would be a death sentence and we don't have test dummies to shoot either.
---
I’ll take free shit from a bunch of dead people any day
---
Rewards were worse yes, but it was more fun to grind and it has also leagues, global events, manhunts and apparel events included, so there is more than just a pass. And it was also free. 
---
FO76's grind was so poorly done that I couldn't do it.
---
Yes your done for today
---
Yes yes and more yes.
---
Hit for the first time with Auto-Complete, everything done except for the NW mission.
---
Dam   that really sucks then
---
I for one am happy about the changes. I think the game should be a bit harder then it is. I fail to see how it will effect anything aside from making players work harder for stuff. After all, I have seen countless posts on here and other sites saying, I’m done with this or that already...now what do I do? Well, now you won’t be done so fast and you won’t be so bored, and if actually playing according to your level is bothersome or boring, then perhaps you should go play a nice game of solitaire instead of something that requires effort. 
---
You will still be able to gather materials from areas and fight within those that contain a specific enemy for any challenges. It won’t change anything except make it take a little longer.
---
Its really bad timing.  People are already pissed and the daily grind has burnt out others.  Why add gas to the flame.
---
I just started too. Oh well. Thank you.
---
I haven't, but I know not all streamers are the same and I'm sure the there are some great ones out there. I just have no interest in trying to find that needle in the haystack, I'll just play my games instead.
---
SQB = Scorched Quest Bean?
---
I am on xbox
---
Really steep
---
I favorite everything that's not legendary. And i rename everything i wear to [Secret Service R-Arm] etc so it stays at the bottom of the list
---
You’re gonna be grinding for a good piece though, strangler heart you only have to craft once and that it, so it’s probably cheaper and easier to do the strangler heart, it boils down to whether you use normal armour or power armour more really
---
Oh you should add the different robot figure models, those would be perfect for a comic shop
---
I can miss the glow if people start shooting before it gets to the central hallway, or if I am looking the other direction (I tend to perch up on the turn-in machine and cover both sides, so I can drop down and friendly fire heal the NPC's when needed),
---
no its obviously Scorched Quill Boom- the scorched sheepsquatch that fires explosive quills.
---
If they nerf my bloodied build into nothing I’m just gonna pull out my magic lmg. Amongst the biggest issues that this game faces is that enemies are so goddamn spongy that without bloodied it’s legitimately not fun to play. Especially if you want to use a pistol or really anything that isn’t meta, bloodied can make even those weapons worthwhile. Bloodied is a symptom of this game’s main issue: 95% of everything available to you in this game is useless, whether that is armor/weapons, or builds themselves (there’s no reason to use a sniper rifle, or berserkers build for example).
---
So I can get 6 lunchboxes a day by spending my gold bullion?
---
Shit, here we go again...
---
*finally, someone with the guts to help*
---
Errr the majority aren't sponges.  Any vats build 1 shots most enemies.
---
Only scorchbeasts and behemoths take multiple shots.  Im sure there's a couple more but far from the majority.
---
It’s already been solved
---
Ooooh! So no beans at all? :( Bummer...
---
Gotta ask, why are freezing enemies so bad? Is it like an AoE effect radius?
---
I'm wondering if the Sympto-matic will provide free disease removal at CAMPs.
---
Thankfully I farmed lead, steel, acid, fluorescent and cobalt flux along with HRF, glowing and hardened mass.  The Scrapbox has came in handy for the storage of the finished materials and my mule holds the ingredients for stable flux.  I really wish that if you die after Scorched Earth you didn’t lose the stable flux so I’ve learned to immediately use a scrap kit from the atom shop to move everything to my scrapbox.  I know it’s not much but it eventually adds up.
---
Some neat ideas, likethe see no/hear no/speak no evil poses, and the BoS bunker is faboo, but the only things I HAVE to have are the greenhouse CAMP items … and they're all the way at the end. Ugh.
---
I'd really, REALLY rather have a system where you can pick the reward you're getting somehow. Like I don't care one bit about weapon skins or power armor skins. I'd happily pass on those to get the greenhouse instead and not have to kill myself on the grind.
---
Psn is the same as my handle on here ^^^ :)
---
I have no idea how many do that. Sacrificial blade on a machete is kinda cool
---
Truth really hurts. Lol
---
The only one I know is melee with strangler PA, poison bow mod and sheepsquatch shards.
---
People are already pissed about so many things so why do something that will piss people off more.  Just doesn't make any sense.
---
typical bethesda, break what isn’t broken and ignore game breaking bugs
---
Yeah, i'm not a fan of bloodied but switched to it when Legendary run started when I realised i could level up 3-4 levels per day instead of 1 every 2 days just from the synergy it has with unyielding.
---
Considering that stash storage is crap two years later.... Come on.. time to expand already. Especially with CAMP sharing space. Yea, extra carry weight from armor is awesome. Damage output.... I cant even come close to Bllodied with AA or Furious. Nerd rage and Adrenaline only goes so far.
---
Nerfing one build (and most likely doing some general adjustments to player, equipment and/or enemies) instead of individually rebalancing all others would be the most efficient course of action, specially in the short term.
---
Overtime improvements can be made to other builds, eventually allowing Bloodied to be buffed back, but no longer as an OP build.
---
And now ESO is one of the most popular MMOs.
---
Unless it has changed though, the “point” goes into the category you picked, no matter what card you select from your current deck of available cards. 
---
So, if you have 4 points in strength and choose that for your next pick, it will go up to 5, even if you say decide to choose “power user” from intelligence for your next card. 
---
Unless that has changed you need to watch what you initially choose as you can’t change any of those points until level 50 and even then it is only one at a time as you level up.

I think the whole point of the change was to eliminate the runaway calculations that were causing “magic” damage.  It’s the least elegant and a debatably lazy solution, but we’re dealing with a team that seems to stumble through their content, leave half of it on the floor, and is likely still working remotely from home.  
---
I’m sure they’re wonderful, passionate people, but attention to detail and consistency are not qualities I’d ascribe to BGS Austin.
---
Exactly!
---
Whenever game developers decide to nerf something to achieve the intended level of challenge and difficulty, most players perceive it as if they're being personally assaulted.
---
Those same players also ignore basic match by suggesting buffs for the underpowered aspects of players' in-game power instead of nerfing that which is overpowered, and then suggesting a boost to enemy toughness as a way to balance everything overall. What they often fail to realize is that both methods accomplish literally the same thing in relation to TTK. They just don't like to see the numbers go down.
---
I also heard about private server. Plus someone mentioned regular server hopping fixes this bug, but it might take a while, like 20-30 hops
---
NO!
---
Lol! That literally makes no sense. 
---
The point of bloodied is this. You keep your health at 80% to get the max damage bonus. Why? So your first hot one shots the mob. Then added all the damage protection, and everything else, like perks and autos Tom even if you take damage your saved. 
---
So without the extra damage from bloodied, you won’t be killing everything before they hit you.
---
I mean you even say the infinite healing. 
---
You are literally explaining why bloodied is over powered. Mega damage, no risk, infinite healing. 
---
Bloodied is really about removing risk and challenge from the game.
---
Then complaining how boring the game is.
---
Its a good way to recycle old pass item/contents.
---
Witcher 3 Gwent is easy mode. Spinoff Gwent is more balanced so of course people will complain.
---
I know right! I wanna be able to freeze enemies near me.
---
I get sort of the same issue on PS4. I'll be strolling and suddenly the radio will get almost completely silent and all I hear are you sound of footsteps, gunfire and what sounds like wind chimes
---
Haha you assume I was posting as if that was me. No, I am a bloodied HW/PA build, probably the “best” build to handle Ops- the only “weakness” is Resiliant enemies and I just have to bash them once with my gun.
---
your gear and build gets better (it should)
---
Completely agree. I made a post about it earlier but it got downvoted to hell, idk if I just worded it poorly, or the salty bloodied builds saw it, or what
---
Its fun.  That's the point.  If it is not fun for you, maybe try something else?
---
It isn't a Bloodied nerf specifically, but it's a big nerf to builds that stack damage bonuses, which Bloodied builds were the most guilty of. Bloodied stealth and bloodied melee food builds more than anything else. Honestly, it's a step in the right direction for build diversity. I agree that bullet sponginess needs to be tuned, but even when these changes, its nothing like The Division levels of bullet sponginess where non-boss mobs could take multiple full clips to down.
---
Like FFXV?
---
I feel sorry for my mousewheel when i scroll my 'aids' in the stash. All vendor/magazines/bobbleheads i have to skip first
---
Also happens sometimes on PC
---
And the cost for this was to NERF damage.  Bethedsa isn't happy if we are.
---
I think people are upset cause that's what they do EVERY SINGLE TIME there is even the slightest change to the game. Whenever something is added to, removed from or slightly altered in the game folks instantly go into rage mode. We end up with eighty gazillion posts on here complaining about it and stacks of YouTube videos about how horrible it all is and how Bethesda is the worstest ever. 
---
It has got to the point where there is so much rage that it loses all meaning. It happens so often and with enough regularity that I'm sure the folks at Bethesda see it and, much like I do, react by saying "here we go again with the bitching." The players go from 0 to Karen instantly regardless of how major or minor the change happens to be. 
---
I've personally seen countless posts on this sub about how bloodied needs a nerf and something needs to be done about people one shotting the important enemies. Bethesda does something that nerfs bloodied and can possibly help ease up on the one shotted enemies and everyone loses their god damn minds. They just can't win. Damned if they do, damned if they don't.
---
There's time.  There will be a double score weekend, and an 'extra score' week.  Plus you can purchase a couple levels if you are a little short.
---
It would probably piss off a bunch of people with some weird ass spider phobia. I get it if you don’t like something like spiders, I don’t like snakes, but if you see one in a fucking video game and get so scared you piss your pants? Come on. I read an article a few days ago where somebody refused to play Skyrim because of frostbite spiders. What the hell?
---
I meant just by looking at the shown damage at that moment in the inventory after taking off a damage modifier (ie Bloody Mess, or a damage perk card) and comparing to before. Or is that not reliable?
---
Regular scorchbeasts can take a while crap load of bullets to kill now since they scale higher with hp and armor while you scale lower with damage. Sbq without magic or hacked weapons is damn near impossible even with a full server there
---
I think the change was made in an attempt to eliminate the exponential multiplicative magic damage from happening.  Will it work, or simply be a blanket damage nerf for all....who knows?
---
I could be wrong, but that was my understanding after reading Valseek’s post.
---
I get this too on PS4. Seems to be server, not audio settings related, as switching servers solves it.
---
Man this game has alot of issues today I couldn’t complete my dailies challenge because when first lunch the server everything went black couldn’t see a shit tried to switch characters nothing, when daily time rest everything back to normal wtf.
---
Haha bloodied build
---
No; if I want to play a horror game, I'll play Resident Evil.
---
Please do explain the perk load out needed for bloodied. As a bloodoed who doesn't use stealth or power armor I die constantly if something so much as sneezes on me. In return I kill them easily myself.
---
Uh...ok....I still one shot stuff on a low health vamp build. Maybe some mobs take 2 bullets but a auto handmade doesn't really care. The major difference is that I can stand in the middle of a mob of ghouls and murder them while maintaining 30-40 hp.
---
What I was trying to do is separate the benefits associated with bloodied from the other benefits associated with low health (adrenal rxn, nerd rage, unyielding) and show that other builds can take advantage of those things. All of those perks and mutations are not bloodied specific.
---
I started when Fallout 76 hit xbox game pass which was 5 weeks after the season started and I'm already ahead of where I would need to be to get it finished before the season ends.
---
I'll come back to Div 2 next season when they actually drop some repeatable content (Skyscrapper) like we've been asking for since release. However the rewards for FO76 Season 2 are freaking awesome so I'll still be playing FO!
---

Another fun fact. When you use a gatling gun, flashes come out of your back. I was doing AWOL Armaments and another player was wearing the black PA paint with the black gatling gun skin and noticed it.
---
Oh I didn’t see that Xbox one on your name whoops
---
On pc, and this one is old for me, but inconsistent. 
---
If someone starts encryptid and I am not at the event, my audio muffles with only the sound of distant wind.  This effect will remain until I relog.  If I'm at the event, this glitch does not happen.
---
Hasn't happened to me in a while, but I also haven't not gone to encryptid in a while.
---
It is to a degree. Actual damage output based on those numbers will vary however
---
Truly unfortunate. Power armor is in dire need of a buff. Thanks for the response, though.
---
Hold the back button to leave menu btw. If u get stuck.
---
I second this comment.
---
Sorting was already a feature in Fallout 4. I would hope that means it could be done fairly easily in 76.
---
same
---
He kills my pets if I camp near the roads.
---
Did you not read the warning about PvP when you took the workshop?
---
God damn right!
---
This happened to me yesterday and this worked for me.  Go back to your settings / controls and reset to default.  The PTT keybind should reappear at the bottom.  Reassign your key(s) and then exit and restart FO76 so it saves the settings.
---
don't carry junk. ever
---
I didn’t realize I could repairs my weapons. I spend the first 20 levels crafting new machetes and 10mm pistols every time they broke.
---
Im deathly afraid of spiders but thats what i love about fallout it always keeps me on my toes i dont know what scary things gonna encounter me next
---
PSN is same name as reddit name, add me up im always looking for peeps to play with. Im on everyday
---
Your gear remains lvl 45-50. You can have better legendaries of course, but now they don't give an insane damage boost because of additive multiplier stacking.
---
Haha, I thought I was doing well with 25 levels saved at level 152.
---
Well this won't change that, my berserker build can insta kill those enemies and my damage is around where the nerfed bloodied damage will be.
---
Depends. With my fixer I definitely instakill a lot of enemies, and maybe that’s wrong, but if I want to use a laser rifle, to kill a single super mutant warlord even with all the rifle perks takes like 60 shots. If I want to use a pistol, it gets even worse. But with bloodied versions of those weapons I can actually kill them in 10-15 shots. I guess what I like about bloodied is that it makes weapons relevant, because this game really pushes you to use meta weapons like HM or the Fixer, and I hate that.
---
Is that event currently out?
---
Jamesski86
---
This. I am going to buy the Gauss Shotgun plans in another day or so just to have them on my main in case I want to try shotguns in the future, but at this point I don't really need any of it. But buying lunchboxes for grinding levels for respecs, yes please.
---
Xbox here. Same.
---
Finally I can rebuild my base once the upgrade comes out
---
The second any challenge is introduced to this game you guys just fucking cry and whine non stop that your op build can't one shot everything anymore.
---
Considering the ease at which L64 Super Mutants, L75 Fog Crawlers, L95 Behemoths and other can be 1/2 shot atm (even with pipes! ) I wouldn't consider the current arsenal of weapons is underpowered to deal with L100 enemies. In fact isn't one of the whole points of 'One Wasteland' (which the current PTS is testing) to address the ease at which current weapons become OP? Maybe it'll take 3, 4 or 5 bullets...what a drag...
---
Yes I did read it, but didn't expect something like that. I thought when I would be on my workshop I could fight back and take back my loot, but apparently no. There just was no way for me to attack him.
---
Supposedly the Bog enemies are still high level for low levels, I believe.
---
A bloodied build is just Nerd rage, adrenaline, and +75% damage from bloodied. Instigating is 100% on healthy enemies, and given most of your kills are one hit kills anyway one doesn't even need a bloodied weapon to essentially have a "bloodied build"
---
TIL= Today i learned, he didnt mention it was most people.
---
Bethesda could up the stash limit  but they are too busy fucking over people's builds with damage reduction.
---
Do you actually sell comic books (magazines)? Because that would be a major let down if you didn't.
---
Not yet, but soon! Currently only on the PTS.
---
You're right, that does make it easier, but when I had to do the Rose questline involving the Gourmands at Wendigo Cave I was a level 20 using a nice level 5 .50 cal hunting rifle a player made for me cause it was the best weapon I had.
---
I wanted to be a power armor heavy gunner, but couldn't equip basically any of the guns at that point, or any power armor besides Raider, which I had no plans for. So when I go into Wendigo Cave and it's filled with level 62 ghouls I have to sneak headshot 5 times to kill each, and the mirelurks are all replaced with level 50 Glowing Mirelurk Kings who have hp pools so big it makes the ghouls look like level 1's
---
You can sorta see why this dynamic scaling is needed, because I legit couldn't do anything in the cave thanks to a high level entering in the last hour, and had to just run while the Mirelurk Kings chased me, and then watched them oneshot the Wendigo I was supposed to fight as the final boss of the place to loot the thing it had on it.
---
Plans, stimpaks, radaways, bobbleheads,  overpriced legendary items
---
Added both ign. Mine is PrivateHudson78. Thanks!
---
Have you seen a Cryolater in action ingame? Can you imagine how playing as a melee build would be if every single enemy was ranged, and had the Cryolator effect on their normal weapon? Colonol gutsies with their AP guns, that also do Cryolator?
---
Oh, I will be playing too, there is no question about it.
---
And I would have been playing it all the time, if I had weeklies and dailies to do, but since I am not interested about season rewards, I had no reason to do those and faction quests started to feel like a real job.
---
Yes, they're pandering to the people who don't want to put in the work. Cause fuck the hardcore players who spent hours putting in the work to refine their build and trade for gear.
---
There will always be a meta, and the foodies will always bitch that said meta is "too OP," so then that will get nerfed and a new meta will come into play. Rinse and repeat.
---
I'm talking about PTS, there are some changes regarding damage [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i9yv3i/no\_it\_isnt\_a\_bloodied\_nerf\_on\_the\_pts\_its\_a\_nerf/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i9yv3i/no_it_isnt_a_bloodied_nerf_on_the_pts_its_a_nerf/)
---
Who stands right outside the entrance to the boss's location. Right next tot he armor stand and note exchange machine. Which are near the sunny vendors (not the cook, the other ones)
---
That’s... Yikes. I’ve seen the effect, and I *play* melee. Not bloodied mind you, but yeah, those fucks are painful. 
---
Add on slow down... I’m gonna need more stimpacks.
---
Holy fucking shit make assumptions much. I am NOT the build I posted about; I am actually the build probably best equipped to handle ANY Daily Op.
---
I'm simply concerned about balance and recognize which builds would be totally fucked depending on the Op they get.
---
Scrip legendaries go for 15-20c per point, steel and lead, gunpowder, serums and stable flux.
---
The whole point of Bloodied was to make yourself God like in your destructive power. Now that’s been reigned in thanks to *the fixes* that have been implemented on the PTS those players are understandably upset.  But this is a good thing for the game overall, from both a meta and a technical aspect. Combat might actually function properly now that damage calculations are being simplified in such a sweeping manner, and second-tier legendary effects such as Instigating are going to get much more use as the drawbacks to Bloodied (and to a much lesser extent, Junkies) become a bit too harsh when measured against the reduced damage output.
---
Ok, I was afraid Season 2 was going to be a bust when I heard the theme, but I actually want some of this. the Chinese skins and outfits are especially cool. Really want the farming items too.
---
Here's hoping they rebalance progression a bit to make it harder to get burned out.
---
When a bug is in the game for a year and a half its no longer a bug. It's a feature.
---
Is there anything stated by bethesda that isnt a lie?
---
Stash limit, unable to put some things from fallout 4 in the game from the beggining, the lack on mannequins or displays etc etc...
---
All to make sense to seassons... pfff that Classic Bos bunker doesnt look bad.. .but its just too late, I will never waste time farming on this game for a dumb reward I will get bored of on barely hours.
---
sad trombone..
---
Things like thus are why I kept my vendors underground. Something odd happening and someone buying too much at once. I drop server, they die.
---
Sounds like y'all have thought this through thoroughly. Mad props.
---
I leave for the Marines on September 9, so I lose a couple weeks.
---
Don’t jinx it lol
---
STONKS
---
you think too much.
---
No need to try, his name is right there in my previous comment.  
---
I don't blame you though, I used to hate watching people play games.  
---
Now I just watch one person do it, and that's because he's incredibly funny.
---
FO76: Hard Mode
---
Sheepsquatch staff also has a poison mod. I do not use it, so I can not say how effective it is.
---
If it's anything like it was on the Wastelanders PTS, then your PTS character would be a copy of your main game character, completely independent of them.
---
Any changes made to the main game character after the PTS character is made will not carry over to the PTS version, and vice versa. Once the PTS ends, then your PTS character is probably deleted.
---
At least, that's my understanding of it. Been a while since I've played so it might be different now.
---
You can finish at 69 if you do the dailies every day and level up a few times
---
I would like tiger level enemies that take long to kill not somezhing random as scorched. If i have ultracite málo and best damage build possible in the game i should be able to oneshot it with headshot.
---
LOL!!! This rocks!!! 
---
This may be a dumb question, sorry in advance, but how did you put them underground? Do you just have a multilayered house, and keep the vending on the bottom/off the side of a cliff or in a dip in the ground?
---
Fantastic!   GT: dydamas. 
---
Thank you.
---
The syringer has a Radscorpion venom syringe barrel which add poison damage, its pretty weak though at 40 damage over 10s. I doubt if it stacks but if it does it could be useful.
---
You do know that heavy ammo is easiest to make in big bulks? You get like 1000 shots for every 100 you can get for pistols or rifles. As someone with pistol build this is absolutely gonna hurt.
---
I prefer the Brahmin only because of the milk
---
Oof, feels bad man.
---
Gotcha. Thanks!
---
Turn off pacifist
---
Ooh...and they can have an immobilizing attack (spider web) followed by melee (spider bite) and then poison (venom) which also comes with other side effects such as blurry vision and slow movement. Have ones that drop on you like gulpers. Have trapdoor ones, jumping ones, and black widow versions.
---
Gotcha!
---
HARD no!
---
those skyrim ones gave me the Hebby-jebbies, stealth archer always just for max distancing.
---
The PTS changes are in relation to the forthcoming One Wasteland rebalance that I mentioned.
---
Ever since I built a decontamination shower at my camp, I just sell all of my radaway and rad-x for caps. I sell a lot of my stimpacks as well. My collectron finds me way too much of that junk but free caps is free caps!
---
This is as close to baileys as you can get without your eyes getting wet
---
Maybe HE will scale, and since mirelurk kinds are absurd tanks I think he might be ok
---
Fair. Thanks!
---
Can't add you because of your settings :(
---
That’s technically tru but a) there are a lot of different ammo types and almost everyone uses a handful of weapons so they need only a few ammo types and b) there generally isn’t enough ammo dropped to sustain people
---
I especially turned it off for this guy, but he had to attack me back to start PVP.
---
Ok apologies, im gonna be on in a bit, i'll change the settings then.
---
SQB = Story Quest Broke
---
I wouldnt mind pve nerfing if we got pvp dmg cap removed.
---
Can you float walls again with this though?
---
The moment bethesda launch f1st the game was desinstalled and will stay like that, whats how I fix the issue.
---
Absolutely. 
---
What's the point of a Fatman when I can't even kill a Mr. Gutsy with it....
---
Workshops override pacifist settings for both players when contested, you can shoot back and do damage. You can even contest a workshop with pacifist on and you’ll be able to damage the owner if they’re there. You should also be able to seek revenge, but your killer may stash your junk before you kill them. Number 1 rule, stash your junk.
---
Should have kept chickens - almost indestructible (unlike that damn Brahmin).
---
Oh, I wasn't talking to you specifically, just to the general mob that I know will be upset by this. And it doesn't take half an hour to kill a regular scorchbeast. I didn't run a bloodied or junkie build for the longest time, and it wasn't like that at all. That's still less damage than what bloodied and junkies will be *after* this patch, so I'm sure it won't be bad at all
---
I hope so. He’s level 30 now. Loves killing the bees that spawn at my camp.
---
Wait that's what that warning is when you attempt to claim a workshop! Is this something they just added? I thought as long as you were in passive mode and at a workshop you could be nuked and not even drop your loot, let alone have a player kill you and take it. Thanks for the info.
---
Set up a foundation floor, attach stairs to the lower side (the side away from the hill you will be building into).next set up either a terminal or a musical instrument on the stairs. Pick up the staurs and place them on the other side of the foundation(where the instrument or terminal is now underground with a small portion exposed). Now when you exit build mode and look at the item, it should still show available to play. Once you play then stand up again, you will be underground and can begin building your undergroubd bunker. Place the vendors here as well and now if someone is taking their sweet time when you log off, you can exit game knowing they fell to their death.
---
Anyone happen to have any pictures of it I would love to see it.
---
True. Only limitation of instigating is that you don't always get the 100% in groups. Splash damage from explosives of other players has the mobs at less than 100% health so double damage. It sucks. If you solo, then it's a great alternative!
---
I wasted so much bullion on the guass pistols and all of its mods. I got all of the pistol cards fully ranked up. It's says my damage should be well over 200, closer to 300. What do I do for damage with a headshot on a lvl 30 scorched? 20. Fucking...20. This game is so broken.
---
Sure, my point is you're not one shot 100lvl super mutant anymore, far from it.
---
Are you sure the resistances are working? I put the white Captain Cosmos paint on my X-01 legs and head and it sure seemed like I was taking more rads than usual in a nuke zone.
---
No it has taken people who were able to kill them in a few minutes over half an hour now. The amount of anmo it costs is not worth it for the rewards
---
I have seen radroaches survive a fatman.   This buff needs to happen.
---
Bows and Crossbows have a poison mod, Machetes have the sacrificial blade, Saryngers have Bleedout and Rad Scorpion Venom mods, Sheepsquatch Shards deal poison damage, the Strangler Heart armor deals acid damage in a small AoE, and all of the Sheepsquatch melee weapons have a Poison-dealing mod. I'd build a ninja character with a bow, sheepsquatch shards and throwing knives, and a melee weapon that suits your style (machete/Sheepsquatch club or staff/sheppard's crook)
---
All my weapons are 1 A ***  1 B *** ect
---
What if I identify as a girl?
---
I've been selling bulk lead at a fairly fast pace
---
Regardless the wording is very similar to the warnings given when loading up the free mods section on console vs loading up creation club on console, [which doesn’t give the warning](https://imgur.com/gallery/FbgFiXO) 
---
As well free mods on console disable achievements/trophies, whereas the CC stuff does not. The wording of “may disable Xbox live features” makes me think there is plans for user created mods, at least to some extent and at some point. Or at the least Microsoft was given some info that mods may work as they did in previous titles such as fallout 4 and SSE. Whether or not that comes to fruition is obviously up in the air given how things have developed in regard to microtransactions and subscriptions in 76, but the wording here points to Microsoft being under the impression or told at some point there would be modding similar to that of Skyrim/Fo4. I believe that there will be user created mods, however the catch will be that they will require a private server, locking it behind a paywall, but I doubt that all mods will be bethesda approved creation club mods.
---
I love this idea. I don't like the idea of players not being able to get the goods if they start later on.
---
I wonder though if gold will be something you can purchase with atoms at some point.
---
I completed it  a week ago and im totally fine waiting for the next season i can focus on other things!
---
boredomshaman
---
In groups I'm looking to do the smallest amount of tesla tagging damage anyway!!
---
Thank you for confirming it!
---
He’s been here for months, killing low level spawns. I don’t have any turrets.
---
Indeed!
---
same shit happened to me all my stuff from displays and vendors got cleared, also autocomplete bug and like it wasn’t enough my game crashed like 7-8 times in a row
---
This happened to me a couple weeks ago and the best solution I found to prevent it from happening again was to log off and go play something else. Seriously, if they're not going to fix it, I'm not playing. I'm not playing the next season either. The rewards are basically the same thing except for a handful of items. I started playing Spider-Man on PS4 and holy balls I forgot what it's like to play a game of quality and substance.
---
what truth?
---
Also you can skin it to look like the pint sized slasher's knife if you have that skin.
---
Yeah, but I suppose with fallout 4 as a precursor to 76, the fallout games have been becoming more stripped down to the more casual gamer. More action shooter than RPG
---
Yeah, I'd like to pick up my pull list please. And has the new Mistress of Mystery TPB come out yet?
---
Irradiated trap-door spiders that burst out of their lair as you pass by it and savagely bite you with venom that slows your speed to a crawl and burns through your health.
---
Yes please.
---
This would be way cool.
---
I’d guess at last Tuesday of September, based on their pace during this epidemic.
---
Again, just a guess.
---
No dont start a new character no point,after level 50 levels mean nothing then a cosmetic number with points to spend on respec.And with the legendery perks comming next month high level will mean something extra slots for legendery perks the higher level you are.So basicly starting fresh would only be a chore for you since you have a lv 177 character only.I myself am at lv 840 and thats my only character if i would have to start fresh,i would never play the game again :))
---
No problem :)
---
Sure they didn't refresh? Maybe they auto- completed. Mine did at least.
---
Thank you for the tip. I will keep that in mind.
---
No please not i would have to grind a new set of unyielding SS armor that's a stupid idea
---
Bloodied is still the best damage output wise
---
Started fun and quickly became a grind. Wouldn't have continued playing it if it was known that items from the Run would become individually available afterwards. Much like many events that take place, players grind them, not because their fun, but because of it being he only way to receive the rewards offered.
---
Seriously.  I would love if the majority of my weapons killed in 2-3 hits since I haven't hit the lottery with one of those overpowered legendary rolls yet, so instead if an enemy is aware of me, it'll take twice, or 3 times the amount of shots.
---
I hate that guy though, especially since he's the one that pops up whenever you look up specific weapons for both Fallout 4 and Fallout 76, and I can't stand that annoying meandering voice he has.  And he just refuses to shut up during his videos, talking when there's no fucking need for it.
---
Nope, I'd quit.
---
Someone commented that their melee went from 1400 to 400. As a melee build this really screws us over
---
Alright. Any new weapons I should try and get that will deal best damage? Ranged or melee, doesn’t matter
---
It's base damage is slightly higher than the regular variant.
---
The downsides of food/drink have not been removed according to the PTS forums
---
Lol what? You still salty you bought this game and don't like it so you comment stupid stuff while following the game and just being a salty lil down voter, get blocked and go play with your tanks
---
If you have not done so already, pls file a ticket with their support. It is probably futile but maybe if enough players do so we might get them to reimburse us or something.
---
Yes you can easily transfer items with 1st,  just don't make the same mistake I did, always use a friend to transfer valuable items, I lost 3 legacies and a J/E/25 handmade. Because I got disconnected.
---
Most of my other builds have been mostly Roleplay, like the mysterious stranger build where I follow newbies around with a good revolver and mysterious stranger-esque clothing, so im tryna do a meta build for once
---
I dont have a build and I’m too lazy to stack, so this nerf doesn’t really affect me. Having to 2-3 shot instead of one-shotting? Story of  my life. But seeing some of the complaints here makes me genuinely wonder how Bethesda could fix this, make the game more challenging while pleasing veteran players at once? Either way, I think the solution will always end up having to use more ammo IMO
---
Xbox? I can help you later tonight if you want.
---
You, sir, are a true hero. 
---
This is the most epic way to troubleshoot, I’m working on this right now. 
---
Thank you for the detailed explanation!
---
True, some builds will have it harder than others. I imagine automatic rifle users would be the hardest hit. .44 is really uncommon and doesn't have many options.

I used a lever action rifle for a long time on my first character. .45 is expensive to make, but also one of the most common to find. As a sniper, ammo consumption wasn't much of a problem anyway. My best advice for any sniper build is go for a .50 receiver hunting rifle. You'll never worry about ammo again.
---
What makes you think that? The only things Bethesda might be giving away is that they don't ever intend to do anything with  the Enclave in FO76, seeing how they never mention them at all.
---
Private world is "safe" but nothing about this game is perfect. I personally got a second account during the sale so my legendarys never level an inventory.
---
Thank you for the help. I appreciate it.
---
I think it’s good. If they’re hard to kill with your current build it makes you think outside the box and maybe switch builds for a little bit. Actually makes it so being completely 1 build always is less viable
---
Not playing is gonna be the new meta.
---
For me at least, they didn't. New challenges did not show up (can't earn SCORE) and also the legendary exchange did not reset so I can't get scrip. It's frustrating.
---
It is balancing the canyon that is in combat between bloodied build and all others.
---
It affects all builds and all weapons in the same manner. What it does is lower the damage of builds that used multiple different bonuses at same time, while still keeping them powerful but not overly powerful.
---
Instead of multiplying the bonuses they are now simply added together, so having multiple bonuses from different sources is still good and this has not shifted the OP status of full bloodied builds.
---
But what it has done is give other build styles a chance and making them an usable option in coming operations and raids.
---
If there were simply one usable build (bloodied) then all would have to use it to get into pugs for operations and raids and all other builds would be ostracized by the massive number of bloodied players.
---
Now other build styles are not so massively behind DPS to make them totally unusable and they can have their own place now (hopefully).
---
There are multiple posts about how this actually affects and several bloodied players are even happy about this change. I'm not a bloodied player, tried it couple of times but didn't find it fun (I find one shotting everything to be not fun).
---
May do one later tonight, add me. gt narmyknight
---
Yes, but also, hopefully a good endgame challenge to try doing solo. I'm going to have to reconfigure my build though to account for the kill-with-melee-only enemies since primarily I'm running heavy weapons.
---
Just hold your horses, looks like stealth is getting castrated, again.
---
Reports from the PTS tell of a "piercing gaze" that some mobs now have.
---
You are welcome.
---
So lets add to f1st that the vendors for them have 10.000 caps, and that lvl up 4 them is x5 times faster... at the end "they are only saving farming and not giving advantages at all right?" 
---
Even better, give them a super salvaging CAMP ittem that can get 100 of any material every 10 minutes... "its just farming" oh wait, what about being able to call for special vendors that require 30+ times doing server hopping in your camp?
---
farming is a way to give depth and reason to the investment realized around one activity to get a reward... in this game is totally abused for everybody with the excuse that "it was developed around a MMO concept", what only can be seen around the farming and seasson conceiving, being the world multiple times worse than F4.
---
That's bait
---
It doesn’t need a buff. 2k damage is enough to kill anything except SBQ, website colossus, imposter sheepsquatch, and a few others boss tier enemies. What it needs is to be fixed. Sometimes it just doesn’t damage enemies, and sometimes it goes through the ground. If they fix that it might actually be good
---
Yeah I finally just found my last comic book I've been looking for in vendors for like two weeks now. I have them all!!!
---
That’s what I was thinking.  I hate the constant screen alert that tells me I have radworms, so I’ll definitely buy it if so.
---
dont you worry, changes from 300dmg to 180 on handmade for example,means nothing.  
---
U ll be still one shooting everything except bosses of course . The main reason why bloodied has godly damage is because of the stealth bonus damage ratio. If they would nerf the stealth  then the bloodied would die out quickly
---
In hell where they belong.
---
Same ones from last night.
---
If you need pictures or better info, there may be a youtube to watch them do it, seems to have an explanation for everything there. If not, I can take pictures on my camp as it is and maybe upload some recordings for it as well.
---
Bullion for Lunchboxes!!!
---
Now this I can get behind!
---
Ive thought the exact same thing. Why not irritated spiders!! Honestly, I would love to fight these creatures. I mean, we have Emperor Scorpions &amp; we've had Bark Scorpion in NV so why not some, oh idk, Irritated Black Widow's or Brown Recluse or whatever dangerous spiders are native or live in WV. Bethesda, please. Hell, we can even have an event to control the population of said spiders. Idk.
---
Pls file a support ticket. Maybe they actually will do something about it.
---
Unless they change how we level legendary perk cards then ever time you move a special pushes your progress back.
---
However it really depends on if it's worth it to you. A second character is a lot of hassle
---
To be fair, after hanging out a lot in the market in most occasion the tool isn't too far from the pricing I do in the community I am in. Sometime it was though so it will be useful to have both data available.
---
You’re on fire with the downvotes today, bud.
---
Oh neat, thank you!
---
Never new this, time for a  re watch!
---
I’m with you bro
---
Only in daily ops afaik
---
Love it.
---
Decades ago we called this "titty bonus". I thought we moved away from that?
---
Can’t tell if your saying that the BOS donations are terrible or if your saying your leaving and I should leave to
---
I read all these junk food build Karen's ecstatic that bloodied got nerfed and it's all damage lol welcome to Nerf 76 how about camping 76? Did NW get nerfed lol could you imagine doing less damage in that mode. I'm logging on to nerf my Fallout 1st time to move on...
---
Brave
---
I see. Baking contests as in actual in game baking contests? Sorry, not much of a MMO player. Most I have tried for the genre is this game and Planetside 2.
---
I thought season 1 was bad smh
---
Curious to see how they integrate Fallout 1st stuff into it like they said they would.
---
SS isn't really the Enclave though. They only belong to it insofar as they are part of a government agency.
---
In practice they're in the Enclave's pocket, as they took orders from the treasury department and the secretary of the treasury was Enclave. (And died in the bunker, probably murdered to make way for the secretary of agriculture in the chain of command.)
---
But as a whole, they probably never knew the Enclave existed. They just received and executed their orders. Individual operatives would have known ofcourse, like the treasury secretary's personal security detail and the presidential security (They wouldn't just have let the president leave for a shady oil rig without knowing what was going on), but not the organisation as a whole.
---
The first one that comes to mind is the sacraficial blade mod for the machete.
---
Remember this is still the early days of the pts It could still change. Nw isn't something we get the ability to test on the pts unfortunately
---
Does the chicken coop spawn chickens like the Brahmin pen does for Brahmin? Seems strange to add it if it’s just a re-skin of the Brahmin pen with less features (I.e. the spawned animal).
---
Yeah, he just laughs at himself when he dies.
---
You are asking 4 something that was asked more than 1 year ago... GET IT, IT NEVER WILL BE FIXED
---
PS: By the way clean your mouth I did not downvote a shit, but now I will because you are the repost of the repost of the repost of the repost, that at the same time is the proof Bethesda dont cares a shit.
---
Or give us new currency that lets us upgrade existing gear to the new higher level
---
I want the game to be harder scaled. I'm level 480 and mostly bloodied and I'm excited to be forced to think a bit more on how I approach the enemy vs just running in unstoppable.
---
Yeah. You can explore it normally or take part in a daily op at its location.
---
I never done it myself... Can you link me a how to do it video? I will check then.
---
I'm just saying, if they nerf damage like it seems they will, this games hardcore community is going to once again lose some loyalists
---
thanks for sharing.I started playing recently so I didn't know
---
yes, and the worst of them all will be wearing a clown outfit to get revenge for all the wendigos we killed dressed as a clown...
---
Firing off nuclear warheads is not being a Nazi. Seriously... If anything it makes you a true capitalist and uber 'Murican, as the only country in the world that actually did detonate nuclear warheads in anger was the United States, not Nazi Germany.
---
Mod support eh? So all of the bugs will finally get patched by competent people just like in FO4?
---
You rock! I found the perfect place to set it up, I’ll get back atcha if I have some trouble, so far so good! Thanks again, you’re brilliant!
---
Frustrating day... Ran event after event, put up with numerous quick wheel freezes, Iv'e had 3 black screen bugs &amp; now my challenges haven't reset.. 
---
And the next patch is going to fix none of that and break more stuff like every other patch.. :/
---
If you are camping North/West you can sell a lot of bulked junk, but if South/East then mostly people are after Steel/Lead/Plastic for their ammo making.
---
Cheap plans trickle out my vendors at regular intervals. Pocketed armour doesn't last long, and some of the more unusual camp plans are sought after by low levels (Brahmin pen, different lights etc), but don't even bother with the most common ones as you'll struggle to give them away (yet I still see chemistry and tinker benches for 50c..why?). When I camped on the southern edge I sold dozens of Ultracite PA plans including full sets, but this won't sell up north as its resource intensive. Full T-45 or T-51b sets might do well though.
---
Exclusivity should be enforced for most of the items though, especially the skins. The ammo converter makes sense, not so much with the chicken coop, but whatever. 
---
Why should people bother grinding over long periods of time if everything can just be bought at the end?
---
That bad?
---
shrimp i guess....
---
Welcome. My gt is kingsites12. I’ll send a invite and we can do it
---
My Daily’s never reset either. I stayed logged in during the reset and checked 2 minutes after to find the timer reset and ticking down. The challenges were the same and already completed so there goes today’s score. 
---
I thought Bethesda fixed the problem.
---
Avoid workshops unless on a private sever, griefers love them.
---
I so hope that this is true.
---
Watch this video and calm down sport. It shows the actual season 2 rewards
---
Personally I'm gonna wait and see.  While I do agree that something needs to be done to balance the game, I do not believe that nerf everything is the solution and I do not trust bethesda to do enough testing to get balance right the first second third or fourth time.  So I'm gonna see where it goes and decide then if I need a break or not.
---
For events like Rad Rumble, Encryptid, or the Colossus I go to the map, click on player dots and send them a message "Colossus" or "Rad Rumble?" etc.  Not everyone comes but I always get a few players showing up.
---
Happened to me today for the first time. Weirder still all of my Daily Challenges are the same as yesterday’s.
---
And what are your proposed crafting materials that would make up this item? Unless there’s a very expensive material that’s needed like the Christmas presents or Mole Miner pails, you can probably forget it. Gold bullion is pretty easy to earn too.
---
c'mon you get drowned with radaways and rad-x from the very first beginning... 
---
no one is ever run out of rad-x or radaway. same for nukashine, there is literally not a single player who says "oh cool that's exactly what i wanted into the season pass" since... you can craft this shit anyway, same as the med supplies. this is no reward at all if you can infinite ammounts anyway.
---
Yeah, beth really doesn’t give fallout the same love as ESO. They never check what they do, and bugs and unbalanced things are always gonna be a huge issue here. I still love the fallout franchise, including 76, since it was my first game I ever bought on release. So I’m gonna keep playing it on and off
---
That would be great!
---
The only Daily Challenge it gave me is the Nuclear Winter one. All my others are the same as yesterday’s and already completed.
---
Have you tried using a shotgun that's not magic, literally any pistol, or a hunting rifle or anything like that? At least on live I can actually kill a scorchbeast with a 10mm. You people preach about "I NEED THE CHALLENGE", but have literally never used a sub-optimal build/weapon. If this goes live my gunslinger will be completely unusable.
---
 Weird. Hope this doesn't happen tomorrow
---
Gatling lasers are really underpowered in this game. Two shot legendary effect also not that good. Try regular gatling gun.
---
Except lunchboxes. I think thats a bad idea. There used to be a limited amount if those out there and they are pretty OP for gathering xp. But oh well, I dint think its a *terrible* idea
---
I love how literally every comment is, "op isn't a girl, girls don't exist on reddit."
---
So you know, the game board is a known bug and supposedly will be fixed. The Capt Cosmo outfit is supposed to have a helmet, again, known bug with planned fix. (Keeping in mind this is hearsay from previous posts about the same issues)
---
It’s hard to say without seeing your build. Others can recommend their build types but it’d help you get a better build for you specifically if you have a layout you could show. 
---
You may want to hold off on making any major changes though as one wasteland will see every build nerfed at different lvls
---
To be fair, eso and 76 are completely different teams from completely different divisions and iirc, 76 was made by basically the b team as it were.
---
But yeah, it's a shame.
---
Try Junkie's. You get a constant +50% damage and get to feel good about your life ruining addiction.
---
I had exactly this happen to me today. The only throwing I can think of was I did the Weekly 10,000 XP repeatable challenge around the time everything reset.
---
I want rad-spiders.  I love spiders.
---
Im on ps4. Could give you some weapons. Got shitloads.. and cant sell em for leg scrip.. since its 150 a day lol
---
A bloody explosive kneecapper that doesn't ever break for a few unwanted legendaries. I'd say you got a hell of a deal. Great nuked White Springs gun.
---
I have multiple characters that use different builds and weapons. Haven't tried pistol yet, though. I can imagine certain ammo types, such as .44, would be a pain to keep up.
---
I will say that I can use 1000 rounds with my heavy way faster than 100 with my sniper.
---
Thanks i won’t!
---
dodgy is a flat 40% damage reduction and is better the more AP you have.
---
It seems like it might be a new version of the bug. 
---
Mine are not only already completed, but they also are the exact same daily challenges I had yesterday.
---
With weight limits for stashes, it's just not that simple.
---
So does this mean Bloodied is more akin to a glass cannon now?
---
Fair point, but still. ESO is still a strong game after however many years it’s been since release, while many people said they hated 76 since launch and there are still tons of 76 fans distancing themselves from the game everyday (more than regular games IMO)
---
Damage multipliers. Those are being fixed next patch to be addatives like everything else.
---
The problem is how 2-shot works with "spin-up" weapons. You get one extra shot per spin-up, not per shot. So if you shoot 30 beams, you're getting 31.
---
What you want is junkies, bloodied, or furious for a heavy.
---
I personally am a collector and I like the time I sink into stuff to matter. I like standing out from the rest, especially the bozo that shows up at the end of the season and is like “what’d I miss? Oh I want all this stuff too! Bethesda Atom Shop plzz.” Those people can fuck right off. If you’re a weekend gamer, you deserve to look like one.
---
This is just my mentality.
---
This was one of the best feature of Lufia 2:Rise of the sinistrals on SNES. Also cointained some of the best best gear is you won a big prize at slots or blackjack. https://youtu.be/Xhsz6NWFNOE
---
Fuck that, I ain't paying monthly to enjoy the game
---
Ok John Cena
---
losing junk is a part of the game, if you want to complain about it, there's an answer for about $12.00 a month, which is pay to win, but I'm not here to argue about that. either play the game and experience losing your junk or buy first to always store your junk whenever, wherever.
---
lol..
---
people be getting what they been asking for and regretting it yo.. lulz all around
---
Really an unfortunate change
---
this is exactly the same what i showed. do you want to promote your account or what?
---
i'd like to see vid of this happening tbh
---
Changed the settings :)
---
You just said to never carry any junk, and now you're saying to just deal with it?
---
Do a plastic run then bulk everything you can. I never bulk lead,steel or wood because I use it up quickly.  Once ‘bulked’, keep 5 of each bulked item and sell the rest.  Also, smelt all ore.  After that, you’ll see what you need to restock, and you’ll see what junk builds up that you don’t need.
---
so when you say objective, you actually mean subjective, and when you say viewpoints, you actually mean why people who think the nerf is good and Bethesda are wrong
---
I just played Grounded this last week and I found out I'm an arachnophope. I have never had a problem with any everyday spiders but if that spider is 3 meters tall I apparently get mild anxiety. It's a bit funny since I had absolutely no problem with spiders in skyrim so I don't know. Maybe it's tarantula spider I don't have a problem with.
---
4 of mine did, but I logged off shortly after, and logged back on a few hours later and all was back to normal, IIRC.
---
Weird.
---
Actually Heisenberg was the leader of the Nazi nuclear program. He failed miserably in his attempts, although for decades the myth was upheld that Heisenberg intentionally sabotaged the project, more recently declassified documents and wiretaps have revealed that he really did his best to design a functional nuclear warhead but simply failed.
---
He miscalculated the critical mass needed for an explosion and assumed he needed several tonnes of U-235.They never succeeded in constructing a self-sustaining nuclear reactor, they were confused by the differences between an atomic bomb and a reactor, they did not know how to correctly calculate the critical mass of a bomb, and they thought plutonium was probably element 91.
---
And I'm not even mentioning things like using heavy water as a moderator instead of graphite or "light" water.  
---
Einstein never worked on nuclear warheads for Nazi Germany and the Nazi nuclear program was doomed to fail.
---
yeah. do not carry your junk, if you do. you're going to die, and someone's gonna take it and you're gonna come to reddit to complain about it. or you can buy first and whenever you know you have junk, place that neat little tent and put it all in your scrap box :)
---
Happened to me for the first time a few days ago.
---
They will take your idea and fuck it up beyond recognition
---
I didn't complain about it.
---
Awesome ty
---
Lol you have less farming to do and you find yourself with no reason to keep on the game 4 today? talks very well about how enjoyable the game is aside getting points to unlock cosmetics.
---
Thanks, I was having a hard time finding the damn directx updater. I already had .net 3.5, but I was missing some Directx patches. Thanks man!
---
why are you still replying again?
---
TIL about the two shot Gatling laser’s shameful secret.
---
I’m actually a bit angry about that.
---
Naturally
---
Drugs. Just, so many drugs.
---
You’re all good, I really appreciate your generosity! Thankfully I have my OG character  with quite a stash, just building the other one up gradually (where this occurred on) and was surprised someone could do that- but feel free to add me anytime, name is in my description!🤙🏻
---
Well, if the idea is to encourage build swapping....
---
Why does ranking up legendary perks cost you perk points? That's diametrically opposite switching up your build. They use the same resource. Rank up legendaries, or switch your build, pick one.
---
Nah but f'real, I get the concept, but...
---
 EVERY stealth build is screwed by this. (Super high perception is an "always on" mutation). Then there's mutations that make enemies cloaked until they engage (and apparently is super buggy; I haven't run it yet but reportedly sometimes they don't decloak...), which screws VATS builds. Then there's enemies that freeze you, which screws melee builds. Then there's enemies that need to be meleed to finally die; that screws most ranged builds. 
---
And most bloodied builds live on Stealth, both for damage and for survival. Non-bloodied stealth builds need the damage more and the survival slightly less, but it ends up about the same)
---
So if you're a bloody Stealth VATS sniper, you're triple screwed. No stealth, check- you lose damage and die hella easy. Camouflage mutation? VATS is much less useful. Resiliant? Now you have to go melee everything. Freezing mutation? Eh, that one doesn't matter all that much.
---
Bloodied stealth melee?  No stealth. Camouflage is "eh". Resiliant is irrelevant. Freezing SUUUUCKS.
---
Guess which build has basically zero downsides? Power Armor/HW. Yeah, you have to melee them, but you don't use stealth, you don't use VATS, you don't care about getting frozen, and you can just run up and gun bash enemies to finish them off. And Bloodied PA does this even better than any other- I come out of Ops with more Ultracite 50cal ammo than I went in with, and I'm still tanky enough to survive it intact without using more than a few stims (and I can just swap to a vampire LMG for a second if I really want to)
---
So all this CURRENTLY does is pigeonhole 1 specific build type (PA/HW, most likely bloodied). All others will have... issues.
---
Full Health shotgunners might be okay? But Enforcer seems totally broken, and most current shotgunners depend on VATS, which is problematic if you face Camo enemies, as well as having enough AP for the final boss.
---
Are you a PC player ?
---
So what's the point to food or drink items. Purified water becomes good just for caps then
---
What kind of response is that?  You said to stop complaining and just suck up to Bethesda, I said I wasn't complaining.
---
I'm guessing you didn't watch where there's literally 2 icons in this video. A train set, bench press, a different handmade skin. A few emotes, a train set.... etc. You people take this datamines to literally sometimes even in season 1s board only had some and definitely not all the rewards in it from the first datamine and it was barley similar like the board. 
---
And no I wish I could make YouTube videos.
---
Is there some form of medication you should be taking that you haven't? This is truly horrific and would totally work in a horror game or possibly a modded horror f76 server when mods are released.
---
That's because eso has a strong backing in the development department.  New content, consistent support etc.  The formula is there.  
---
I feel that if 76 got thr same treatment in terms of development and support, it probably could be a lot better than it is.  But I kind of feel like it's just going to spin its wheels going nowhere, and one Appalachia is probably going to chase off a fair few of the people that have been here a while.  It may survive, but it will never thrive.
---
Mostly as well, I don't think 76 is going to survive the console generation change.  People are going to change consoles, get new games, and probably move on.  Even if backwards compatible consoles are a thing, something will happen that prevents that from working appropriately.  I'm sure of it.
---
Yeah, I remember being part of a group that solved every one and we was all buzzing when we solved them accurately
---
Are the daily ops good so far?
---
And to think I was almost done collecting damage stats on all the weapons in the game at every level... if i have to re-do melee weapons all over again I might just scream
---
The game encourages the development of inventory and resource management skills. It's not a good sign if you're forced to carry more than you need
---
Ammo converter is level 5, is rather get end level rewards.
---
Just traded for almost 500 florescent flux last night for making .308 ultrasite just for this. If you've seen any of the PTS footage from the first time around then add the nurf. At least we won't have the nurf just yet.
---
i took this one: [https://www.falloutbuilds.com/builds/heavy-gunner-build-2/](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/builds/heavy-gunner-build-2/)
---
At least you can make them into white orbs in the settings. But orb weavers are the bane of my blood pressure.
---
Hahaha maaaaybe.
---
Ermmm shouldt it be set in the past and not in the future?
---
For real lol, people are always saying the only threats in the game are Mr. Gutsy's and Assaultrons
---
Now finally enemies won't die in 2 seconds to almost every build ever, so now your brain can actually register they exist as something more than loot piñatas and they're talking like it's the end of world lol
---
I recall during the livestream they said enemies in the Event area will drop ammo type of the weapon you're using. Is it still low amounts?
---
they are not resetting you can take your time
---
It’s sad for me. I’ve recommended many people 76, even though everyone I’ve saw irl talks terrible about it. It’s been my favorite game on and off in the past 2 years. I wish it just got better support
---
TS MIRV fat man, yup
---
I'm not carrying more than I need, if I was, I would drop it.
---
Its better it hit u on a daily score challenge rather than a weekly. You're lucky!
---
Reminds me of the old days of Diablo II when people would pretend to be a female while playing the Sorceress for free items.
---
Good to see a fellow duper trying to make us look good. Keep up the effort! Don't forget to show up for the dupe meet this weekend. We had a blast last week wish you were there
---
Oh thank god
---
You forgot about talens mutation. That’s a massive increase on unarmed damage. Twisted muscles can explain the melee reduction as well. Math is not hard.
---
Well damage is for every weapon different. And if they're primed or not, if you use all damage boosting perks, mutations, etc.
---
So let's take my tse gatling gun for example, bloody mess, stabilized, Tenderizer, 30% health with adrenal reaction. 446 damage, i also use strange in numbers so when i'm in a group i'll do 477 damage. However get below 20% health with nerd rage and i'll have around 570 damage, stack this with Adrenaline for x amount of kills and you go close to 800. I personally don't use nerd rage as i have dodgy so i rarely go below 20% health unless in Queen fights or when i'm out of ap. Now those damage numbers are without my gun being primed, i think i do an additional 50% damage if that's primed.
---
Gun deals so much damage because it's slow in firing, the gatling laser however works with Dps. Damage per second, which is 71 for example. But your fire rate does 71×50 per second. So to make it easier, you deal 71 damage with 50 bullets in under 3 seconds. Which means your damage output is higher than my gatling gun. Because it fires 1 bullet per 3 seconds. 
---
Same rule applies to the LMG, it deals less damage but it fires 75 bullets in under 3 seconds at a damage of 80 for example. So 75 bullets are deadlier than one bullet which deals 6 times the damage, this is how some people deal more damage.
---
choose to play the game vanilla, and deal with what happens in vanilla game play I.E. losing your junk. or, pay to have a handy dandy little tent to prevent you from losing your junk.
---
“Please don’t make an iconic weapon actually usable late game”
---
then youre a girl? its pretty easy
---
I agree with you. The game uses a series of equations based off of your buffs, legendary prefixes and perk cards. When I deal so much damage from all my stacks the server can’t calculate all the information at once all my damage buff, all my armor penetrating buffs, all the enemies health, damage resistance and buffs it rubber bands. Can’t compute fast enough so it rubberbands which I figure just deletes the last part of a calculation after the game did because the server couldn’t register it. I would say the game has no problem with calculating, worked fine in FO4, it’s the server that can’t register it in and that honesty not on Bethesda,  but the server company they rent from which is a subset of Amazon I believe.
---
holy cow i was on pts myself today... i saw the whole board, and yet the few rewards are all the same setting (red communism and ACE).
---
a few emotes? it's one.
---
Some camp items like a bench press? who has the camp budget anyway? also it's bugged rightnow. 
---
yet another handmade recolor... wohoo, we only have 6 or something like that (it's not even a reskin, the skin is already available).
---
we take this datamines as what it is, data. and these datas are terrible bad compared to what we saw for the ATX store.
---
It doesn't work
---
I hear you!
---
I’m ok with all of this just so long as atoms aren’t the currency needed to buy stuff
---
Hey so do you know of any discords?
---
when you have pacifist enabled.. there is no PVP
---
unless...
---
you take over a workshop...
---
I'm literally okay with it.  I never said I wasn't.  I'm not op, can you not read?  All I said was that it's hard to manage the tiny stash we have.  That's it.
---
Holy shit oh man I'm turning 6k steel into mini nukes tonight.
---
They absolutely destroy. Needs nerfed hard. This is not a sarcasm
---
In tamriel.

I think Beth needs to let people play how they want to play. Seriously stop nerfing builds because Ive just got nice bloodied guns and my unyielding set, now I hear again of more nerfs so I again question the point in having builds in 76 at all. I remember my weightless set for constant stealth in survival mode and when I finally completed the set, survival was removed and nerfs added. If I remember they nerfed tse around that time
---
Big fan of this idea 👍
---
Glad to see it's not just me that feels that way.
---
I know you aren't OP. and you won't have to manage a tiny stash if you get an endless one.
---
I actually need caps
---
Does that work with armors reduction cap?
---
Very true
---
Not nerfed, changed from multiplicative to additive in terms of buffs. Bloodied got hit hard because of how many buffs it has.
---
I’m a little bummed they won’t buff the bad effects
---
How i tested this with a two shot gauss mini that's not accurate. It did deal twice the damage of 24 which is lots weaker than bloodied or furious resulting in only 48 but unless this spin up is only with the older weapons that's not accurate.
---
There is a Stand AND a Station in Season 2.
---
You definitely would if someone caught you in PvP
---
You say that, but...
---
Is it really nice? Or is it also not that noticable? My understanding is it's been nerfed down to like 2-5 DPS.
---
When I'm doing 4000 dps, 2-5 dps is utterly unnoticeable. it'd have to be 40dps to even be a 1% change.
---
No different than making raid rewards available for bullion after the raid closed down.
---
Apparently they can follow you down to in the lab, I left the lab and was met with a giant spider outside. I can admit that this game is actually a bit too hard for my tastes since what I wanna do is build my base and kill shit. Not being scared to go on runs to gather dandelions.
---
I have yet to get mobbed and killed. The only use I have seen for vats is soloing campfire tales, and that would be negated if i had a good explosive weapon
---
Yeah its not even a Balance patch its just nerf everything good into the ground and call it a "Balance" patch lol i grinded like a year for all my Different bloodied builds if they just destroy it im def done with this game
---
Exactly. Bloodied is king with commando, but everything else is a little bit different. 
---
I’m gonna miss my awsome plasma caster doing 1.2k on a headshot though. Really was fun to have
---
I didn't forget Talons. I'm not focusing exclusivly on Unarmed. Again, 1h is like 75% as powerful, but my 2h is basically the same.
---
Discovering Whitesprings resort during a nuke at about level 40.  It was the first nuke I'd been in and the first time I saw hordes of glowing ghouls.  Died a few times before I found the wall between the swimming pool and the clubhouse.  Tried to get shots on everything and ran low on radaways and stimpacks and ran out of ammo.  
---
Everytime I tried to loot a few ghouls more would show up and chase me back to the wall.  Higher level players were dropping crappy legendary items and I was in heaven.
---
It’s still the strongest, but at about 70% stronger than a standard mutant build, with 5% of the hp.for now it’ll probably be pretty useless for endgame content
---
It is still the same. Seems like they forgot about what they planned to implement in this patch.
---
Right outside wayward it’s always there at the weapon bench across from it I see it everytime I go to kill brahim
---
Only thing that's gotten a significant nerf is bloodied and melee. Stop overreacting
---
Sure. Added you just now.
---
Do us a favor and remove post TODD
---
Yes but now "low level" events will spawn lvl 100 enemies for high level players, making most events worth it again.
---
A quest item tab
---
What the hell even is that.
---
claim workshop
---
wait for people to take it from you
---
fight
---
alternatively, look for people who own workshops and are currently in them. they may call you a greifer. this is because they didnt pay attentuon to the notice that claiming a workshop flags you for pvp.
---
turning off pacifist mode and fighting outside workshops means you have to shoot each other to "agree" to fight. inside workshops, it's war.
---
Yeh not too fussed. Got it early. But I'd rather have known that in advance. Rushing home with 90minnleft to do my dailys gave me alot of anxiety 😫
---
Ew wtf. If the rank system is like The Legendary Run's with an extra 25 score each rank...I'll sit this one out. Ill just stick to my Wheeler, Rawson &amp; Co passes instead.
---
Yeah so all my 4 builds and now i should grind for all my gear again?def not
---
Maybe instead of crying for nerfs, people should have asked for builds that weren't performing well to be buffed.   Having said that it should be much easier for Bethesda to adjust perks, weapons etc  without risking them unintentionally shooting into the OP AS FUCK category.  Whether they will make any attempt at further balance past this is the question.
---
Just a letdown add me if you want I need people to play with
---
You stepped into a PvP zone which automatically opens you up to PvP. Which means he doesn't have to wait to deal damage. Regardless of whether or not you shoot back, workshops make you open to PvP.
---
I hate to be that guy but that makes sense
---
I dont understand a shit... blueprints? are we talking about the option to keep things stored but, in fact built on your CAMP?
---
Blueprints are free to be placed, as they have been already built (and thus materials have been used) no really matter how much they told they require as it has been already spent...
---
You can deploy and store some blueprint 10 times and you will notice your resources are exactly the same.
---
Idk with you talking about 1h being different reduction compared to 2h. They both got reduced the same amount of % to me.
---
They always destroyed, since day one
---
Only if it comes from Fallout 76’s version of One Small Favour.
---
It looks so fucking cool
---
send friend request :) my psn is MyDearVicho
---
I’ll have to check next time. Spent most of my time running for my life.
---
what is Loot All and where can i get it.
---
The benefits of being well fed or hydrated.
---
sent*
---
Were you at max caps?
---
Sorry to burst your bubble but these mannequins are the same from fo4 and they didn't move, would be cool though.
---
&gt;setting you can take your time
---
This makes me so happy!!! :)
---
That would be a nice compromise,  but at the same time I like the exclusivity of the items being legendary run,  I’d stagger the bullion version by a season.
---
Season 1 items arrive in in the Bullion shop in season three for example.
---
Do you run an explosive perk on your heavy gun?
---
You still do significant amount of damage compared to other builds. Just not 3 times more damage. I played pts and I'll stick with bloodied. Don't overreact
---
Wait, they actually did something the community wanted/suggested? Not even being sarcastic, I've only been playing a month and from what I've seen they seem to not even know what we want. 
---
Especially happy about the lunchboxes, though after the run ends, I wont really have a need for them as I'm already lol 133 and only use xps boosts for the repeatable score. So unless that's going to get done again (which is fine in a way)I dont see the point of grinding xp
---
flying irradiated spiders that knock you down with a we attack.
---
i'm never sleeping again.
---
Laughs like a monkey! haha
---
If nerf goes into the base game then imma have to carry around 50k ammo of a given type
---
Ok, big reply.
---
 # 1 I still enjoy the game so I will very likely continue playing after finishing the challenges. I will level up between 1-3 levels on a day. But I try to leave the play session with half a level or even more to finish the challebge faster on the next day. But if I had to go from 0% to the next level, no, it wouldnt take me 20 minutes. I have full unyielding armor, +5% from canned meat stew, +5% well rested and eat SB brain. With this plus a big event line line in the sand, radiation rumble or meditation guide you will get a level up in no time. Also, I skip most of the NW challenges. I don't enjoy the game mode so I don't play it. But if I had to, I would use a new character and hide in a bush for 15 minutes.
---
 # 2 yes, feedback is good. It is allways important. But this complaining isn't feedback. It would be so if Bethesda had to do something to fix the "issue". But the issue isn't on the devs side. The devs implemented a system that rewards you for playing the game, specially if you play every day. But you dont *have* to. Turns out, the repeatable challenge makes up for it more than we thaught. Take Angry Turtle for example. He said he doesnt even open the daily challenge menu, even though he plays almost every day. And he is almost done with the run. 
---
Besides, as I stated before: the run will be over in 3-4 weeks. There is still plenty of time for us to finish. So people saying that they are burnt out from the Legendary Run need to realize that it was their own fault. Expecting Beth to do something about that is nonsense. IMO the challenges are perfect right now. You can play every day to get all the reward, or you can grind for them if you want them right now. 
---
Finally, no you cant have daily challenges that last a week. Then they would be weekly challenges but in a weird way. They are actively trying to get you to play every day. I realize some of you dont want to play every day. And that is fine, its also why the repeatable challenge exists. If you can't or don't want to play every day then you don't have to. You can still get every single reward but it wont be as easy.
---
Edit: format
---
Played on my bloodied, level 478 commando.
---
Let’s just say my heavy gunner character might have to retire.
---
I feel kinda stupid for not knowing this too. 😂
---
Is that the one which tells budget cost in numbers?
---
It's called active camouflage
---
I'm not any help in this situation, but it's also really shitty that people will assume you're not actually a female. There are many ladies who play this game, I'm sure you'll find them.
---
Im still mad that nerf everything good into the ground is called a Balance patch
---
I just dropped 100+ spikes 🙄😐, because..habits...🤦‍♂️
---
Why can’t you just manually tag junk?
---
This is not a bug. This is how workshops operate.
---
Yeah back then they literally destroyed themselves and didn't stand out with other tses doing absurd amount of damage
---
The real life Wheeling Island is a greyhound track. Would love to see some mutant hound races
---
Yeah, guy was weird too. Came to find me during a SBQ event and kept adamantly saying “I’ll trade you right now but ONLY right now.”
---
Wanted some vanguard pieces I had in my vending machine.
---
I was like uhhhh, ok buddy, settle down...here ya go. Figured I would keep it for a future build but I might just add some shotgun perks and use it now. Not having to worry about condition is kinda nice.
---
I ain’t paying $13 a month for that shit
---
Next week you could ask for legion ears
---
That's the Wheeling Feeling. Look it up
---
And let's not forget that Bethesda said that having infinite stash will make the game unstable, then started to sell unlimited stash
---
Girls are myth. Facts
---
Yeah, I tested it with a T65, fully painted to Cosmos. I took the same amount rad damage in the painted version and in the none painted version.
---
The legendary perks help offset the nerf a bit.
---
I fully leveled up the sneak ranged card to 40% more  dmg. Man, did I burn through the perk cards tho.
---
This is hilarious, serves you right. Die foodie die
---
girl = **G**uy **I**n **R**eal **L**ife
---
~~yeah I'm out, I know where's the exit door~~
---
So how does the legendary perk PA reset work? Does it give you FULL hp back or just what you have? I run bloody PA.
---
You played pts? I really don't get your attitude. Nothing's nerfed to the ground. You still one shot everything minus bosses. You want more nerf? Fine by me. Why's everyone so sensitive?
---
I'm inclined to concur.
---
Yeah, my shotgun build is wearing stuff like ghouls slayer, chameleon, etc with a crappy 2-shot, +10% damage when aiming. He’s a high CHA build. He doesn’t  have any major mutations (no adrenal for example)
---
The only things that bother him are assaultron. Everything else is 3-4 shots. I thing that’s fine. Maybe i’ll actually start using psycho to do more damage
---
Are you logged in when they reset? If so log out of the game and wait 10 minutes.
---
I do the same with plasma cartridges, which are a bitch to find in the game.
---
"Besides all the player icon (12 in total)" sorry I assumed you couldn't look at the board after that lie 🤣🤣 and no its 2 emotes mind blown and watching you. Im just saying these are a step up in rewards.
---
This looks amazing. Can’t wait to look for it in game!
---
Let Todd the God drink your tears.
---
Whoever downvote this is a terrible 76 fanboy or just a child
---
The game is a fucking grind to begin with. Did they not wonder why people prefered bloodied over literally anything else? Because having to farm mats for ammo all day is boring.   
---
I'm not sure what the point of the change was, other than to upset people.
---
The game needed this desperately IMO.
---
Lol.
---
No, workshops have been this way since the dawn of the game.
---
you will get 12 icons from the board, at least the dataminefolder for the second season contains 12. i assume either they cut it or reward them along other rewards which are not shown yet.
---
Oh it means somethings breaking for example
---
Wasnt being contested until he shot. When you claim a work shop you basicly fly a flag saying come get some. The damage is normal since it warned you when claim the work shot that others might come take it. He wasnt wanted because he took it fair and square. The first thing to do when you take a workshop is build a stash or scrap box and dump all your scrap so if someone shows up you dont run into this problem. The pvp players will look to see if your at your work shop because its the only chance they get to pvp now except NW.
---
Most likely not. But it is possible. If you get max Int and constanly use xp buffs you could get enough xp to get to level 100. But it would be an awful grind. I dont recomend it. 
---
The next Season seems to have great rewards! They have datamined them and if they are legit then we will get some epic stuff. I recomend you wait for that one.
---
Yea a lot of The Mire dailies don't reset for me very often either 
---
My theory you only get a certain amount of dailies per each location, and it randomly picks from a list of all the dailies which one you get 
---
The reason I think that is cuz that's how the raider dailies work anyway
---
Had just fast traveled to another location. Could be a bug from fast travel, who knows. I've literally never taken video off ps4 gameplay. Would have tried, but needed to sign off quick before my serums and rare drops ended up gone as well.
---
 one of those triggers once a day  not all of them each day.
---
I think this is only second time they have nerfed damage in the game. First was two-shot and explosive at start of 2019, well before survival mode was taken down.
---
Even if they keep it as it is now in test, your bloodied will still be super powerful and doing 2-3 times what others will do.
---
So put on your big boy pants and stop whining YOU ARE STILL THE MOST OP BUILD STYLE IN FALLOUT 76.
---
Idk the exact numbers of the nerf but right now my gatling gun does 446 i don't wanna end up with just 260 then i might just toss it away
---
Sorry I thought I did but to lazy to check if I do have it
---
Resilient mutated enemies means I'll have to move 6 points from heavy gunner and move them into gladiator and incisor. My Junkie's Power Attack Sheepsquatch Club can *usually* take most enemies out in one hit but it sounds like these enemies will be a challenge either way.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA that is hilarious.
---
Craft and scrap my dude.
---
But doesn't it do explosive damage, not just rads?
---
it's either automatic receiver, hardened receiver or powerful automatic receiver. 
---
You need to scrap handmades to learn the mod or pay someone to mod it for you if you cannot find an actual mod which i'm not even sure if they exist tbh. 
---
Is it for a legendary gun or a normal?
---
Before the raiders were at crater I went there with my Fatman. After 3 nukes the super mutant I was attacking was still coming after me so I gave up on that trash weapon. I also noticed occasionally if you miss in vats or its far enough away it just does t explode. I would love this to be a more useful weapon.
---
I want a pet dog that doesn't die every server hop
---
Now the real question is, a JE or TSE gatling plasma would be better post-nerf. Now, JE with beam splitter beats the TSE variant with beam splitter.
---
Tried that yesterday already. No joy.
---
At about 20K, getting ready to purchase next serum recipe. Had just fast traveled to another location. Maybe it's a glitch due to fast travel/vendor purchases. Could be nothing malicious at all, just a terrible bug. Hope it gets identified and fixed sooner rather than later. Took the vendors offline, so will have the joy of restocking again, bleh
---
What if it’s too big a job for one man? We’re not men and women, we’re fucking gods.
---
I can mod it for you if you want.
---
My reply was along those lines but not quite as pleasant 😂
---
You sound like Trump. Sad!
---
I personally wouldn't use TSE legacy even if it does more damage. I have no interest in using my repair kit every 10 minutes
---
Depends on what you're using to get to the 1500 but overall it's about a 40% nerf to all damage output for all weapons.
---
A rebalance was necessary for one wasteland but it's a bit more than was necessary so hoping for minor tweaks though at least the immediate damage reversal seems to be gone (where you hit an enemy and do too much damage at once and it just auto heals them)
---
Uhh. Regular spiders are still the dominate species. They didn’t need to grow.
---
True that. JE with 40% brake reduction tends to break in 2 days (not overused), but TSE would break in 1 day, or less...
---
I just wanted the power armor mainly.
---
This is smart I applaud you.
---
You can get them as a drop from claiming workshops but what system are you on? I might have one in my vendor i can give you. Ill check when i get home.
---
Not sure about consoles, but while looting, I press R twice in quick succession on PC.  It opens the enemy’s loot and you just press R again to take everything.  It also works with containers.  If I’m burning a lunchbox buff or on a timer, I just take everything and worry about sorting it later.
---
I got downvoted and suddenly the post got removed?
---
OP, go to uck yourself
---
These arent plans my guy. Craft and scrap or pay someone the mats to mod it
---
oh yeah okay you mean the normal UI where you open the inventory and press take all. i thought there was something i missed in my 500 levels and you‘re using a function to just loot all surrounding corpses at once. heh
---
I'm on xbox
---
And what is this op build? I need a new build...
---
You must be really conservative with your trigger. I tend to spam a lot and it breaks really often. I ended up equipping non splitter barrel and surprisingly it still does its job and even better when dealing with sbqs it seems. That's just my opinion but definitely worth trying out
---
Did they say why? Were too many whinos complaining again?
---
Well I just went through the burrows one against freezing high perception robots (your nightmare scenario) using a bloodied gauntlet that isnt even maxed (no drugs, no twisted muscles/talons).
---
Died a lot, but still managed to do it solo in under the 16mins for recruit level
---
Dont forget your hat!!!... but seriously, don't dupe guys...
---
Bloodied stealth commando with a Faster Firerate tommygun.
---
Automation good sir, automation.
---
How many players spend the time taking inventory, manually tagging/untagging, etc..
---
Demand for different resources fluctuate and sometimes an unexpected shortage occurs because you avoid that resource like the plague since your character typically doesnt need it.
---
The result is inconvenience, I could have been gathering that junk the past week I've played but passed it up. Inventory management takes too long if your trying to constantly balance all your junk so many just don't.
---
Enjoy the game more and worry about clicking through menus less
---
I have 9 points in commando, 3 tank killer, 3 nerd rage, 3 bloody mess, 3 special ops, adrenal reaction, 20% health, no chems, no food, no mr. sandman, no adrenalin.
---
If the- 40% would apply here, I could live with it.
---
Most of the vendor exploits were only possible if you're way over budget on CAMP from exploits like the circus trailer, roof change, etc
---
Happy Cake Day! Also, I’m not sure. I’ve just heard the news from multiple friends. But that’s what I would assume lol
---
They didn't nerf bloodied, all damage calculations have been changed so all damage on all builds was reduced not a specific build.
---
Workshop PvP allows you to attack back even if you were in pacifist, so you could damage him, you just suck
---
my gamertag is TheReconJacob if that's the platform you're on too, thanks :)
---
Use a private server. I helped a friend finish this last night on my private server.
---
Happens to me on my main all the time. My alts are fine to go in though. PS4
---
They nerfed near everything, filter by hot someone broke down the numbers/details
---
At the risk of downvotes, by definition a knife has a rounded end while a dagger is pointed. (Knives are for cutting/slicing and daggers are weapons) 
---
While I dont necessarily think thats why it didnt count the dagger, I wouldnt be surprised.
---
Health bloat has never, ever been popular, and it doesn't make things 'harder'. Just more monotonous while wasting resources. Nor does it change the meta; everything is basically the same, but cut down in damage across the board. Bloodied is still better than every other build. As is Junkies.
---
Higher weapon damage has been amongst the first things added to Bethesda games with mods since Morrowind, for a good reason.
---
I don't want to kill the Queen in 45 seconds, but as it is, my Stealth Pistoleer flat out can't even contribute in any meaningful way to any group event.
---
I've noticed some of the items on the game board on the PTS aren't labeled correctly, have wrong pictures, and many plain old typos. 
---
I wouldn't assume this is intentional. Yet.
---
This. Build doesn't mean shit it you can't find the spawn before it's dead. Which in uranium fever is all too common
---
it’s not a nerf to bloodied, it’s a change so that instead of bonuses being additive it’s multiplicative. It affects everyone.
---
Honestly it’s necessary, even the shittiest of my builds kill things in 3-4 shots
---
&gt; most the map becomes obsolete once you level up.
---
That is true.
---
Natural solution: To create new content for high level players.
---
Lazy solution: as usual, to make players to re-utilize all the things they served us two years ago.
---
Yeah the pipboy numbers will show a bit less than you're expecting (doesn't seem to be showing proper end damage as base damage) but across most builds and most weapons final adjustments average about 40%
---
So you're probably looking at closer to 800-1000 per shot.
---
Damage as a whole is being calculated differently. ALL damage has been decreased. Because low health builds take advantage of multiple damage multipliers, they saw the biggest decrease in damage.
---
Junkies is down. Furious is down. Enemy slayer is down. Mutants is down.
---
Same, i have the same problem the first time I try to go in
---
Tbf, during the S1 run, those were high end items on the race. It wouldn't be fair to people who worked hard to reach the chicken coop only to release it for 50 gold. This way players still need to grind for it
---
Yeah, those dirty weekend gamers, having lives during the week. DISGUSTING. THEY SHOULD BE FORCED TO LOOK DIFFERENT IN MY VIDEO GAME.
---
Join my games and claim workshops there for protection, ign Nekrosias
---
Yea I cant even go there, I crash every time
---
Damage calculations got changed....and god forbid you can’t one-shot everything.
---
I see your point, but the items are locked behind bullion.  If someone starts playing in summer 2021, it’s a bit unfair to never, ever be able to put ghillie streamers all over your armor if you so desire.  If they have to buy it while we simply had to complete simple tasks every day, that seems reasonable to me.
---
I like exclusive items that indicate “I’m an OG”, but I feel there’s a point where it’s uncool to be so cool, if that makes sense.
---
Edit: we can also buy our way through the run right now, simply by opening our wallet.  That sort of ruins the feel of exclusivity to me, as far as the seasons are concerned.
---
next time he should allow you to keep wasting your time doing nothing at all...
---
Thank you! I hope I make new friends on here to 🤗
---
this would be good enough it keep my build, i feared I have to switch to a lever rifle. thanks.
---
My first and only time was tge 3rd day, I only lost 1250 score. After that, I am not infected by this bug... and I am almost done with the Run (I need like 7-8 more days).
---
Im down ill send you a message. Im always on at least a little.
---
Wouldn’t be disappointed to see them remove daily’s tho
---
The problem is, bloodied stack so many synergies that it's absurd at this point. They are nerfing synergies so I think this is the right way to go. Will still have to come up with further adjustments in the future but this is a quick fix that addresses half of the balancing issues we have atm
---
So you are saying you are fine with everyday combat being monotonous and just taking more time, not being more challenging, then? I'll never understand the people that do backflips to wilfully ignore or brush aside concerns. This isn't some death blow to Bloodied and Junkies. If anything, even nerfed, they are now even \*more\* valuable as the meta because they are still or even now the only way to kill things faster.
---
You could change your gear to give yourself a challenge, nerfing everything is not the way
---
Looking at everyone’s replies the reason seems unnecessary, and thanks
---
You'd be amazed... at what an AI can do... with a few robots.... and one... friend.
---
It’s not but maybe the post isn’t for you 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Thank you too. You will be bombarded with dislikes unfortunatel
---
Perception/agility build, so sneaky commando, sneaky rifleman, or sneaky pipe revolver (all pipe cards). I also go loud sometimes with both sets of cards.
---
Ammo shortages ofc keep me from 24/7 commando. Needed ammosmith and super duper yet. 
---
I'll add you later when I am on. Almost never have sounds on though, because I usually play when the wifey is asleep. (Odd shifts for her. 😀)
---
I wish.....
---
The good or bad thing, depending upon how you look at it, is that changing your build wouldn't really make a difference. 
---
It's a change to how final damage is calculated, so it affects all builds similarly. 
---
It's just part of an overall rebalance so less people can just one shot the queen while they're trying to make one wasteland a more enjoyable experience for all players. 
---
Only people who are really going to hate the patch is one shot trolls.
---
I’m thinking of trying to LFG to get teams of people to tackle then content. See if we can develop roles to maximize efficiency
---
I’m ready to tackle this challenge
---
I helped a friend on my private server last night(PS4) and it worked. Until B fixes it use a private server.
---
Interesting, do you have the source on this so I can read up on it?
---
Nice try Todd.
---
Oh I am aware. I also don’t give a shit 😂👍
---
I had a furious ripper, a bloodied ripper, and a vampire ripper. All were equally worthless to me even with the right perks.  Sold them to the vendor long ago.
---
Combat rifle? Maybe. But fixers no. You do realize fixers do about 20% more damage when compared with combat rifles? Fixers do even more damage than handmades bro
---
Just recently, I gave a non-legendary Fixer a spin (non-legendary, because god-only-knows how you're supposed to get a legendary version of this gun; perhaps if it was craftable with legendary modules, but that's another conversation for another time), just to see how it compares with my handmade.
---
And uhh... yeah, it's pretty garbage by comparison. I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong or what, because I'm fully spec'd into commando and everything.
---
I can mod your weapons for u if u like.
---
Dude learn how to read. I was agreeing with you
---
I'm definitely not over budget, so that's not it. I'd say I got about 10% remaining
---
You'd probably be looking at 800-900 damage now.
---
Ive honestly always hated the way bethesda scales enemies its just nothing but bullet sponges in some games...
---
Hmm. I'll take a look to see if I have anything that would suit that.
---
As someone who is level 20, how do you gain so many caps? Are they plentiful at higher levels?
---
Well Bethesda is doing that for you so nothing to complain there
---
Dunno then. That's a new one.
---
My gf would never play this game again if they added them.  
---
Doesn’t matter if it’s a level 1 spider.
---
It makes parts of the map that are lowered levels worth the return.  The Forest, Ash Heaps and  Toxic Valley will be worth returning to. Defending low level workshops will be worth our time, too.
---
Oh
---
Ok
---
I think Reddit is just an app for the patriarchy 😹
---
I see now.
---
You might be on to something
---
It would be amazing if they made luck and gambling act like Fallout: New Vegas because then I’d easily get banned from every single one.
---
They made the poison resist / fire resist cards PA compability, so they work with the same set of PAs aswell. They are not bad.
---
If you join the datamine discord someone posted a full math breakdown excel but I think sh games goes over the math calculations in their latest video about it as well.
---
LMFAO I’ve never heard of that but this post definitely isn’t that
---
Ok, so I dont know if you remember but challenges used to be like what you are asking. Odly specific and forced you to go out of your way. Just like "take a picture in a rad storm", they are beatiful and make for awesome pictures. But they arent that common and its a BIG map. Freeze the queen with a cryolator or grenade? I dont want to do that. In fact, most of the player base didnt enjoy those type of challenges. In fact, if they were in place right now people would be going crazy! For example, the bobblehead challenge. It makes you go out of your way looking for something that might or might not spawn. 
---
And yes, the way Beth is handling engame grinds isnt good. We know and they know. But that is not the objective with the challenge system. Challenges are not supposed to be a grind. They are supposed to make you want to play every day (or almost every day). Once you are doing your challenges an event might pop up and you stay longer than you planned. 
---
Its like saying if you play my game I will give you candy. And I say awesome, I get to play AND get candy? Thats cool. What some people are doing is going: candy? I want candy! I NEED the candy. 2 months to get the ALL the candy? No, I want it NOW!
---
I formulated that wrong. You need to be logged out when they reset. I have had this happen to me as well but not since not beeing logged in on daily reset unless this is something new. Hope it helps.
---
I want to be able to one shot westtek supermutants. If this would'nt be possible with a commando, I would switch to a lever because it deals more damage per shot.
---
He killed me like immediately so I wasn't able to attack back. Later on after respawn I can't attack him and damage him in any way.
---
2 shot shotguns also only shoot 1 additional pellet.
---
I meant voice chat
---
It also happens sometimes when entering the Enclave bunker.
---
The atomic onslaught or the captain cosmos?
---
Despawn was probably Curly Joe, nobody likes him!
---
Can you give me an example?
---
Love this; good choice of items too tbh
---
No. Fixers are already the best rifles in the game right now. They don't need a buff. Either do combat rifles, they are exactly where they are supposed to be.
---
You need a better legendary version of one. Just because you don't have a good one doesn't mean they need to be buffed.
---
I have it on t65 and excavator and take same rads. My excavator is only level 25 still being I just use it for the 570 carry weight I get with it and some buffs and the ores. T65 is way better tho but I hoard so I keep a lot of stuff on me
---
It just works.
---
I actually disagree with the "buff everything else" approach. Because that's how you get power creep, and power creep is the death of online games.
---
Another online game I play (I won't name it, but it appears a lot in my comment history, if you're that curious) has been completely fucked over by obscene amounts of power creep. The developers of that game have power-crept everything to the moon and back, and are only now trying to dial everything back to a reasonable level again. And it's just been a disaster.
---
Cough Cough Berkley Springs Station Cough Cough
---
Dont go in the front door,  use the backdoor, never freezes...
---
Oooofff, sorry to hear that
---
it's for a handmade. Legendary one, too.
---
So the legit builds will all be nerves, but half the server will still be running around with magic guns, ruining events. Got it.
---
Thank you! I didn't know how to join a group; this is great.
---
Good, making new builds and optimizing when the meta changes is half the fun
---
Yeah, but we're limited on vendor slots, so this wouldn't be exactly game breaking. 120 stacks of whatever.
---
ECONOMICS  
---
Can't run from it and just accept its overall power over humanity.
---
So go vendor all your technical data and go farm out a new one from a world container. It only triggers when you loot a new one, stacks don't do anything.
---
You need to reach a certain point in the main quest line at Fort Defiance before it will start.
---
Captain Noob did a video on one with that mod (non explosive) and it was quite underwhelming. Maybe it's better now?
---
I just picked up a Junkie's faster firerate Gatling Plasma and it is tearing shit up.
---
It doesn't
---
this thread again?
---
I wouldn't jump into that full health build so hastily cause I have a feeling you still will keep your health below 20% even with bloodied nerfs. I mean, why go full health when nothing's gonna kill you?
---
The ammo machine and converter still aren't that great, imo.  And the legendary perk, to get it fully ranked up, you gotta scrap what, 100-200 perk cards, since they cost 2 points per card, so that's a waste of a legendary perk if you're only level 200-300, comparing to the damage perks, rad resist, posion resist, etc. I get that alot of people are over 600 and have freedom to get perk cards, but alot of them glitched to get those levels. I don't wanna waste a legendary perk card on ammo crafting. They should have raised enemies health imo. Not decrease damage. From what I thought was gonna happen. I'm a bloodied commando and it takes me still a good amount of hits against, let's say, a mirelurk queen. I could never imagine one hitting her, before or after one wasteland. She's one of the toughest creatures that isn't a boss.
---
Gl finding a group. Most the girls I know on here usually don’t talk much or have a guy group they prefer. Idk if ps4 has a lfg option like Xbox does. May be better off looking through something similar
---
It’s Forbidden so don’t mess with it
---
I agree I would like to see damage increased
---
I always see pics of multiple behemoths at once, but never in 267 levels have I seen more than one at a time personally.
---
Will try that
---
Now if I could only complete the legendary run xD
---
Not a buff but it would be nice if it did the damage it says it will, my TS missile launcher does maybe 100 damage a shot  with perks. Explosive weapons were underwhelming to start and got worse from there with the nerfs they received. It also doesnt help some enemies are immune to explosive damage by design.
---
My bloodied build is a little more casual. Only have one in each commando and 3 tank killer but like collecting lots of different weapons like a 44 pistol, harpoon gun, flame sword, tesla auto, rail gun, smg, black powder rifle, all bloodied, plus a medic flamer and instigating shotgun. Only 1 gun fu and adrenaline too. So vats helps in my case to get head shots when I fight enemies. I'm not super focused on a single weapon type so my one-two shot kills aren't super overkill
---
I’m way past all that
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/fe10in/psa_vats_power_armor_permanently_blacked_screen/
---
Supposedly fixed if you exit and join , perhaps multi times needed ...
---
Ahh that’s good. Thanks
---
And Dodgy builds.
---
One killed me (I’m bloodied and tried to melee him). Then all three were there when I respawned. Maybe let one kill you?
---
I have a solution that works for me.. plug in a headset and your sound is back to normal or do what I did , I had a old headset that wasn't working properly so I cut the mini jack off and now I just plug that in when playing fo76..
---
When you say they "cleared", do you mean they went back into stash or that they disappeared altogether?
---
example of what?
---
Back to your current rad level, perfect for bloodied builds. 
---
And you don’t even go down- you basically instantly restore to max health, so no risk of straight dying like with Life Saving armor or Mysterious Stranger. I haven’t tested to see if you can proc Revenant from it though; based on the way it works, I’m going to guess no.
---
Build a doorway on a foundation, delete foundation, edit doorway into normal wall
---
Scrip. Very little demand for auto pipe rifles and suppressors is not high demand.
---
scrip
---
Beta is an excuse for a bit. A year+ later? That's no longer a pass.
---
I'm not here to defend the OP or their bugs, and I enjoy Nuclear Winter, but "beta" stops covering a coder after a few months; after that it is neglect and/or abandonment of the project.
---
You dropped the /s
---
Take a picture of your ammo numbers with your phone
---
Unless its a tse if its a pipe rifle throw it away
---
Fuck no. I already have to use mods in Skyrim to make those spiders something else. I'd have to straight up stop playing this game
---
Thanks for the info. I appreciate it.
---
It’s supposed to be a scary post apocalyptic wasteland but everyone wants to rp a super hero
---
What a weird post. All the posts about the fixer usually are how good it is or how do I get it, because it's the best weapon in the game.
---
I'm glad it's bullion and not atoms
---
Ah. I don’t have a mic..
---
No pics? I am disappoint. Would have been cool to see it.
---
Orrrrr they could've fixed the actually broken builds and left the others alone? Some of us actually enjoy exploring and not having to worry about stupid bullet sponge enemies.
---
Yeah it's gone but I heard from someone they may be adding the ability to do so again in the patch on Tuesday
---
Skyrim already has giant spiders as enemies, so I can't see why they can't add them into FO76 as they already have "dragons" in the game, aka Scorchbeasts.
---
I think you might be over stating how much better the Fixer is there.
---
If you use Power Armor, get Stabilized in the INT category.
---
This is the rough build I want to use with a gauss minigun.
---
Want cause I swapped out many damage perks for carry weight and weight reduction perks.
---

---
No problem. Of course you could also always make a second character to level up for perk coins since the cards are account wide.
---
The lunchboxes are great since it means the parties can never end.
---
Is it possible it's L Heith, not LH Eith?
---
Because if that's the case, I'm guessing L is Lieutenant.
---
You can get couriers to help with trades. Couriers are trusted community members who act as middle men for trades. Refusing to use a VERIFIED courier is viewed highly suspiciously. If someone refused a courier the best thing to do would be to cancel the trade or insist the individual gives up their items first. ATNT couriers has a page here on reddit. There are several groups on Facebook. Anyone can say they are a courier, it’s your job to confirm or find a real one in your own. Also if you just type “Courier!” In a comment on your trade post, a reddit courier is alerted and will contact you. 
---
If you do get scammed, try to video the incident, take screenshots of any messages confirming the deal, and inform Anna Hilfe at ATNT couriers. She’s a scammer hunter.  With enough proof they can be kicked from the group and publicly labeled a scammer.
---
Recruit level. 
---
For comparison, I’m about 30 seconds off “elder” level (sub 8 minutes) as a HW/PA build. 
---
And I don’t think you can get much better than that; the timers for the relays are the sticking point when you go solo. 
---
No deaths, no broken armor. 
---
So yeah, sounds like you proved the nightmare scenario. Note I didn’t say “impossible” ;)
---
How was the final boss?
---
In my opinion more events like radiation rumble would have been better than nerfing damage. Just give us more events like this with less defending and more mobs. 
---
Sounds like only rifles and heavy guns will be viable after this one I hope not because I don't really enjoy those builds
---
I did this too.
---
There's a bug that you can preform that will let you level him up to a level  91 Glowing Mirelurk King
---
He may have a better chance of survival then 
---
The downside is it involves having to move your camp so you'll have to rebuild
---
it works.
---
You could probably sell it for 1-2k caps but it may just sit unsold.
---
I’m going back to executioner or furious.
---
No idea, I didn't purchase it.
---
Is melee viable? Don't need ammo for that.
---
Get both weapons and check the difference.
---
They do that they'll lose a ton of players.
---
Sorry im ps4
---
Hopefully someone eles can help.
---
It would, but it's not there. There are power armor paintjobs, some outfits, greenhouse housing, BOS field station, foosball table, electric train set, shooting gallery, and that's it.
---
I think people just can't believe that a girl would want to be on reddit, especially a video game subreddit.
---
&gt; The downsides of food/drink have not been removed
---
Typical Bethesda, always going back on their word. I just want to explore the world without worrying about this shit.
---
If it's still contested you can attack him back,
---
No worries. Thanks anyway. Is it just workshops they drop from and any specific ones? Or can they be found at vendors?
---
Still a good investment. It can be used for other tricks.
---
Like seriously.  Every way to f-up anything remotely positive that we can scrape together to enjoy this POS.  Why take it away without fixing it first - obviously people are doing it to build nicer houses. 
---
I just nuked my house because I couldn't delete a foundation stuck under the water (which pisses me off already) and then when I start to build I can't have interior walls.  I just logged out because I was so pissed off.  
---
Done with this garbage for a while - seriously need a new game.
---
damn, assume it'll be a atom shop item then
---
They recently banned players for trading those items so I don't think so
---
Hype
---
At this point I am predicting it will eventually be a give away a year later. Just like how the Pink Suit was in screenshots dating back in February 2019 or the Heart Bed from February 2020 now on 1st.
---
Am definitely gonna play season 2 now.
---
This is the kind of stuff I want not 20 different versions of ghillie suit.
---
I agree with that sentiment. Quite often Id rather just tag everything since I hate making ammo all the time.
---
People that work can spend their hard-earned money to rank up the board. If the IRL stuff that is pulling you away is *not* work that earns you money to rank up the board, then maybe a limited-time event in Fallout isn't for you, seeing as you're not willing to allocate the time and would rather fuck around with other things ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
100 Gold seems really underpriced for three honestly.
---
You should turn pacifist off and wait for good moment to shot back.
---
Considering we get exp in the present, I'm pretty sure it has to be something like this.
---
When you made your claim on the workshop, the pop-up warned you about the potential for PvP. 
---
That’s pretty much what happened.
---
I main a gunslinger for 750+ hours, and have posted guides about them. Youre preaching to the choir
---
Trading for gold bullion would be interesting, but they take scrip to make.
---
and do you know how much a new level 100 supermutant takes to die?
---
What do you mean bro 😂 Beth cant be bothered to fix anything that causes an inconvenience, especially when their main focus is the gold bullion bug and double sided walls.
---
Sorry I was in a hurry at the time
---
I went to about level 150 on my commando before I tried a junkies build. I really like junkies but you can still do good damage just using executioners, AA, Instigating, things like that. Hell I just switched to bloodied on my heavy who's level 290 last week. Only reason I switched was to try something new. People need to Google shit before just winging perk cards on. My buddy was like that level 100 with cards scattered everywhere. No focus on anything. Took about 50 levels to straighten everything out. To some up my ramblings: you don't need bloodied or junkies, you just need to know what your doing when you plan your build.
---
I would just be happy with her being a second radio DJ. She already has a radio station but it just plays elevator music on a loop. She's easily my favorite character from 76.
---
That's actually kind of a relief, I dont need anymore mannequins walking around spooking me.
---
What do you mean they recently banned the trade of SS Armor and Gauss weapons (other than the standard ones)?
---
When were they ever tradable?
---
*Edit:  Now that you’ve clarified it from ‘banned the trade of’ to ‘banned the players for’, that’s more clear. They banned the players for abusing a glitch to circumvent the intended function of the game. That’s quite different.*
---
nevermind I managed to buy it for 150 caps from someone's vending machine :)
---
Plasma pistol can be turned into a plasma rifle so it’s decent
---
When I came back for look it wasn't contested, so I presume that this guy knew what he's doing.
---
Honestly would pay BSG just to have a rose channel that plays new stuff
---
They were via glitch
---
Doesn't it seem strange Bethesda would force us to engage in pvp for the legendary run?
---
Ok I bought one for 500 caps
---
Think most people were expecting the items to be in the atom shop not from gold vendors. Definitely a better option.
---
So they were never intended to be traded in the first place. Therefore, they didn’t ‘ban’ the trade. They fixed a technical glitch.
---
Might as well say they ‘banned’ taking things from other people’s stashes.
---
I just can't use bloodied. As soon as builds become popular, I cease to want them
---
For the only killed by will grenades still work? Equip a syringer, lob a grenade?
---
This would be a great idea. The game need more areas to draw players that aren’t battle oriented.
---
What patch notes are you reading then? Can you link me to them please?
---
I WANT UNLIMITED POWAAAA
---
Does the nerf affect gunfu, concentrated shot and the adrenaline?
---
They don’t. You can claim a workshop and then leave. And there’s virtually always something unowned workshops on the map.
---
If they spent the effort to code 100 super interesting skins or camp items every few months, they would be forced to hide it behind a paywall to recoup the effort.  If it’s a free event, having a few cool items to shoot for is probably appropriate.  The fact that they bother to give us small things for the other levels is a curtesy.
---
The ammo converter was out before the legendary run
---
That's a fantastic idea.  Just have the odds posted on the machine so you know in advance you have a 1/1000 chance to win whatever awesome item.
---
Blocker, Dodgy, Serendipity. With those perks at max rank melee damage is reduced by 45%, all damage is reduced by 30% (at the cost of AP), and you have a 45% chance to avoid damage entirely. 
---
Alternatively, I often play with just blocker, but keep my health between 30-40%. I don't do as much damage, but I'm never in danger.
---
Lame, have a friend tap the workshop and mow them down
---
I think so, I’ve only seen one or two episodes for the source content.
---
You don't understand. Bethesda is really reluctant to ban people unless they did some of the most vilest of things. And they decided to ban people for trading some armor pieces. This shows they are very against it. You never get banned for using some glitches in this game
---
Looks like H was always P, seems there was just a screwup in the translation.
---
I disagree, these are much easier and shorter than Vault 94 was (and I ran V94 a LOT), you can easily join a random public team and crush the Elder tier if at least 2 of you know what you're doing, and the rewards are pretty desirable: contextual ammo, scrip, caps, legendaries, and unique plans like the War Glaive, Liquid Courage and BoS SpecOps outfit. The timer for the Initiate/Paladin tiers is also pretty generous, so I think that even inexperienced/casual players will be able to complete them somewhat easily (especially with Public Teams) and get some cool loot.
---
Did this on line in the sand with a bunch of players. Confetti mess was crazy with all the scorched spawning in the air in front of the emitter. I had an explosive two shot gating gun and just made giblets every bass spawn.
---
B FFR plasmas are valuable are hard to find
---
It shouldnt be a problem the community has to work around and deal with what so ever. Beth shouldnt have implemented a piss poor battle pass that relies a buggy/broken mechanic to even progress through it. It makes them look bad and even more incompetent.
---
Someone always seems to come and contest it.
---
I'll prob end up using both PA reset and mysterious savior. And sorry for the questions but how has the damage nerf effected your play style? And are legacy still playable?
---
I run a bloodied, vats crit pistol build. I used to feel weak until I went bloodied. I'm sure junkies can get you a good damage buff if you're not about low HP builds. I can crit for over 1000(around that) at times. A gunslinger has been my favorite build to play in 76
---
Give it 10,000 damage and a wider area of effect
---
&gt;But the Cranberry Bog shouldn’t be easy for low-level players.
---
Yes it should, they have the right to explore the map just like everyone else. MMO players are so goddamn toxic
---
Lunch boxes with gold bullion is a brilliant idea good job Bethesda. Love that emote when you use it
---
$40 for a half-baked game and an additional $12.99 subscription per month for basic features like private games, PLUS a predatory microtransaction store is "cheap" to you?
---
I don't mind MTX stores like League or Fortnite cause the base game is free. It's absolutely disgusting, on the other hand, to charge $40 for a game that runs exponentially worse than most indie games, *then* charge high MTX prices on top of that, *then* have Fallout 1st.
---
The only thing cheap about this game is the production quality.
---
I have something like that I use for critical hit challenges. It doesn't use much vats and you can get several criticals from one enemy because it takes so long to kill anything.
---
There's a casino in charles town wv and horse races but bethesda didn't even mention charles town
---
That’s a great suggestion.  Thanks!
---
I find it hilarious they haven’t increased it in over a year. Do they expect us to not pick up new weapons and armor, or to stop collecting junk and aid?
---
Im just hoping that respec comes with it when it launches like they said it would
---
This will affect a lvl 1 straight out of the vault, due to str being calculated additively now. You are wrong.
---
I dont think thats too terrible for someone running it solo, with a non tweaked build against worse case scenario (for that build). 
---
Yeah I suspect you can do under 8 mins better in a team due to the boost modifier.
---
Final boss was ok - I did flush my rads though to come back up to a higher HP (around 50% instead of 19%). Made the damage less, but meant I survived it.
---
Her backstory was interesting but her actual content sucked
---
I've owned every top end fixer in the game so tell me which one I should have that actually makes it good per shot because I sure don't see it in the ones I've had. The combat rifles dps are terrible. Again, bloodied and junkies don't count. A full auto version may seem powerful, but the dps is low. My lever actions are far superior in dps. I run a rifle build if that makes any difference.
---
I accidentally duped a full set of Power Armor last night.
---
They didn’t ‘ban’ the trading. They banned players that were abusing glitches.
---
I get your point but your presenting it in a bit of a skewed manner.
---
No. It’s meant to be a high level area, something you work toward. You shouldn’t be able to fast travel to someone there and just breeze through - that’s not the point of a map like this.
---
Reminds me of that bit on the bottom right of the map of fallout 4 where that super mutant behemoth busts out of the crashed tanker at you was epic. Got absolutely whipped but lived that oh beeepp moment
---
Spoiler alert, it doesn’t.
---
LOL, Not even ten minutes ago I saw a pair of lvl 5 players in Flatwoods and gave them lvl 5 recon rifles and fire axes.
---
And her Wastelanders missions were quite funny too.
---
Wow i didn't know you could see months into the future!
---
In the ten seconds it takes to leave the area?
---
You do not have to engage in PvP to complete that challenge. 
---
Just claim the workshop, and as soon as it dings, leave.
---
I’ve done that probably a dozen times without any issue. It’s not that hard.
---
Which is why I used the word “nerf” not “balance.” Unyielding builds get more melee damage, xp, carry weight, etc. Adrenal reaction is just another toned down bloodied effect, on top of another bloodied effect. I have a bloodied character, and the “low survival rate” on it does not offset the positives of it. Dodgy, serendipity, and dmg reduction perks make bloodied builds damn tanky. I only ever die to enemies with poison damage, and to combat that I just need to be careful and aware. I know I have an unpopular opinion. People want to solo SBQ by themselves (even though the event says 8+ players.) and speed run every thing. Bloodied builds needed a nerf to their overall damage because damn dude, look at that utility. Extra carry weight, and extra xp is still amazing! The only thing that sucks is, that Bethesda took down all other builds with them. It should have just been bloodied, and then buff the weaker effects like mutants, and berserker.
---
And I've had top end handmades as well and as a rifle build they're terrible. Yes as a machine gun build they may seem powerful but you're going through a lot more ammo than I am to kill an enemy.
---
Every *good* Fallout allowed the player to explore the map whenever they wanted.
---
Script. We really need stickies on this forum.
---
I know right? I have a 2 Star Double Barrel and it's just like a Hollywood Shotgun
---
In my experience it helps if you don't use wifi and disable all IPv6, DS, DS-Lite, and leave only IPv4 active on your router.
---
This is still an issue
---
Csnt progress the main storyline on Xbox one now wtf fix this Bethesda
---
Mate One Wasteland is on the PTS right now
---
The One Tamriel update is what finally made me get after that game. Before that, it was next to impossible to play with friends if we had different amounts of time to sink in. Now, I can run around and do whatever the hell I want. I can help out low level friends. I can travel to any of the zones, no Alliance locking (pre-Cadwell's silver and gold). I welcome One Wasteland so that I can take my low level friends to awesome places that were previously too dangerous, and I can help them with their content without it feeling like a waste of my time
---
Still not working very well today. Level 65 with every card possible upgraded for shotguns. If it's not a one shotable low level it takes lots of rounds. I thought it might have been the vampire mod being bugged so I sold just about everything I owned so I could buy the plan for the combat shotgun. It is actually worse. Took me 17 shots to taken down a level 52 diseased feral ghoul.
---
Some people enjoy it some don’t
---
Huuuuh?
---
You talking about the Resiliant mutation? You have to melee/bash them to actually kill them. Everything else only takes them to 1hp.
---
I gotcha.
---
Both the Brotherhood and Enclave can fuck right off.
---
Go play New Vegas then
---
I'm on Xbox one and cant progress the storyline.
---
Issue's still here
---
Will keep that in mind. Thanks.
---
Out of curiosity, what does it matter if the camp is partially in the road?
---
Glad i went with a vampire build for my heavy instead of bloodied or junkies now
---
As I said, you don't get banned for using glitches in this game. But when 'trading for SS armors' gets involved, they ban
---
about as hard as the rest of the game. So. Not hard at all.  Unless you're like level 20 or whatever. 
---
no idea what level you complete it at but i did it at like 120 or something
---
That's like your opinion man.
---
Okay toxic MMO player lol. 
---
Can't wait for the *good* single player games to come back and this game becomes a bad memory like Tactics.
---
I lagged doing her missions, so for weeks I had to hear her give that annoying speech every time I logged in. Robot or not, after a while I wanted to choke the bitch
---
I quite enjoy the game, despite the many flaws.
---
Ye notice how i said "when it launches"
---
I know I did a little.
---
That sounds like it would be cool but I like to sneak :)
---
Shut.  Up.
---
I feel you are using your fixer as a non vats weapon
---
Yeah just use the other recommendations in this thread, like using vats or check it internet connection. It worked for me
---
Barbed Baseball Bat, 38 Pipe Revolver, Resistant Road Leathers and Deep Pocket Leather Armor. That's what I give noobs.
---
Can you get the plans for this? Am hoping to do so, so i can provide plenty of them in my free lowbie vendor
---
How do you enjoy that frame rate? Genuinely a front runner for worst game I've ever played.
---
They went back into my stash. I had to put them back into the vending machine
---
Saw five walking together around Charleston fire station. It's happened to other people, too. 
---
Legendary too? Get inside a building and hide.
---
I don't have/use legacies, so I can't speak to that. I do have a magic Minigun, that I'm fairly certain still works- someone spawned the queen, and when she landed, once I spun up my minigun, she was dead before she could take off. That being said there were a bunch of other players there, it may not have been as much "me" as I thought it was (and most PTS players are HIIIIIGH levels with all the best gear)
---
Otherwise the damage nerf isn't that big a deal for me. Yeah, I'm down by nearly half... but I did so much damage before that, outside of boss-level enemies, it really doesn't matter. 2 shots from my gatling gun instead of one? Eh, whatever. And Daily Ops enemies give you ammo of the type from the gun you're holding when you killed them (with melee, or explosive launchers, it just gives you random), and I think 5mm is tuned for miniguns because it drops in stacks of 60-90, so I can farm daily ops with a gatling gun and get all the 5mm I'll ever need.
---
dont care, still having fun playing.
---
I mainly use it in vats.
---
How do you think they are going to do this?
---
I know what you said. But saying they banned the trading implies that the trading was previously allowed or intended.
---
I see you’ve edited your original statement slightly, so that’s appreciated. It is more clear now.
---
How?
---
Some enemies scale to lvl 100, mainly big guys like deathclaws and Grafton monsters, but most are still in the lvl 50-68 range.  If you spend 90% of your time in the Mire and Bog, like I do, almost nothing has changed.  DPS is a bit less, but I’m still killing almost everything in one hit.
---
At this point it's a more enjoyable rpg than vanilla fo4, not sure why you hated it so much but alrighty
---
I enjoy the game it’s fun the frame rate only shits itself when people use explosive automatics
---
Hopefully the damage reductions in the pts are the first step in organizing mechanics to allow for a better gear progression. Time will tell.
---
&gt; It's just like in real life
---
Except real life doesn't have super mutants and Deathclaws
---
it changed a little on the public build already, just a bit. mainly crates being scattered around, probably full of the stuff we donated.
---
Didn’t they respond to this issue saying that it was a little more complicated to fix than imagined?
---
Or am I mixing things up?
---
Xp grind
---
how long did you give it?
---
Chems, us junkie's are always looking for chems at reasonable prices.  Also disease cure
---
because i dont take things so seriously and dont worship the gospel of Jim Sterling or Yongyea.
---
i like fallout. this game is fallout. i played this game. i liked this game. it isnt some deep concept. people just like things sometimes.
---
Well yeah obviously.
---
It’s literally getting fixed in 3 days
---
Oh god I just thought about that
---
They sure are pushing hard to strip benefits from thier playerbase while presenting it as "new exciting content" all for money.
---
Yea they increased the crap in this season, I only expect future seasons to continue the downhill trend.
---
Season 1 map was done so well to distract from the loss of daily atoms.. This board looks much lower budget.
---
1 reason why not. trap camps. they'd find a way
---
move your module around. You spawn north of it.
---
Interesting. My experience with my full health Junkies build vs the final boss was rough, since she seemed to want to keep distance, and minigun+freezing bullets meant I was way slower than her. I'd preemptively switched to a gauss shotgun vs her just to counter not having to try and close distance, and Enforcer doesn't seem to work on her.
---
800 hours and still going strong. 
---
I guess you either love or hate the game. But maybe that’s just me
---
&gt;not sure why you hated it so much but alrighty
---
I've listed a good few reasons mate.
---
I could use some help!
---
Missing in vats literally makes the mini nuke fall through the map and delete itself
---
Took .e a while too. The feature is too nested.
---
No they used a glitch to make trades happen. Normally Bethesda would just fix it and let those exploiters go but they swung that ban hammer. That's a really extreme response coming from them. And I didn't edit nothing
---
What is the pts nerf?
---
My camp is going to consist of 2 compounds. 1 commie and 1 usa
---
Good luck 🙂👍
---
I have tried this and this is not a consistent fix, when you do this players are still able to spawn inside the walls when teleporting to the player inside the camp and occasionally when teleporting to the camp.
---
for me it is quite difficult compared to other similar games, you can not go by wasting ammunition and healing all the time, you must use your mind,  although a higher penalty is missing when dying
---
What console are you on? Runs pretty good on my Xbox
---
The only one I dont use is blocker. My armor is a full set of scout unyielding, with ap regen as well as 20% reduced weight on food,chems, and drinks. Im still dying a lot. Does the melee perk really make that big of a difference?
---
Actually they did.  One Wasteland changes are in too and that makes them closer to your level.  So the most of the enemies in the game did get "harder" in a way.
---
care to put a picture?
---
Reward skin for handmades from season 2
---
That’s accurate. You didn’t edit nothing. You *did* edit *something*.
---
&gt;I guess you either love or hate the game.
---
Definitely the former. I can't believe this is the same company that made Oblivion, unbelievable.
---
The world gives **plenty** of food and drinks for you to never really worry about it.

I did a gunslinger guide a while back, that was geared towards revolvers. Shown here:

Auto 10mm pistols,with the right perks and attachments  costs like 1 ap a shot, and when primed and using  junkies, the 10mm I can drop a 2* legendary scorch beast with 1 mag of sneak headshot/crits before its life regenerates. It's pretty impressive.
---
As for which one is better? Its hard to say mainly because its subjective and your playstyle will change the answer. But fastest time to kill high life pool monsters is the auto 10mm pistol by a good margin, the heal ability due to fire rate is also nice along with being able to stay hidden to take less damage. For normal jobs the revolver usually one shots weak  spots like the head, and it crits for around 800 or so damage when not sneaking, so it hits pretty hard. 
---
**guns:**
---
- Junkie/explosive/faster reload western modded with aligned grip,aligned barrel, reflex sight and servere receiver. 
---
- vampire/explosive lower vats 10mm (on swap)
---
- Junkie 50 crit lower vats 10mm or junkie ffr lower vats moded with : aligned grip, long aligned barrel,swift mag, powerful/prime auto receiver  and supressor.
---
I go back and forth between autos and revolvers, depending on how a feel like playing. I always like to have a healing weapon on swap for emergencies. I tend to favor revolvers the majority of the time for normal running around the map. However if I want to farm scorch beasts are take on the imposter sheep sasquatch auto 10mm usually gets the nod. Just remeber always use vats,sneak, target the head, and hold down that crit button while firing in vats. Pistols lack high damage and armor pen so crital hits and vats is....well critcal to being successful with handguns.
---
If junkies isnt for you ,anti armor or furious is the next best thing.
---
When I fought her she had just come up a ramp - took flying jump over some scenery to close the distance without being shot too much. She couldnt retreat and just got punched a lot
---
Hecks yeah. I'm in. The amount of complaining and repetitive posts are super depressing here.
---
Though it would take more work, you can make a more efficient camp.
---
No planting tiles needed if you make a floating camp with walls hanging down. 
---
I have 10 missile turrets, a bunch of gourds, tatos, corn, razorgrain, all the benches, 8 of the small water purifiers, wall decorations, a decontamination arch, a bobble head collection, a couple magazine racks, instruments, a collectron, a junk harvesting pile, 4 vending machines, 2 instruments, and more.
---
I couldn't have all the stuff I have when I had a 2 story design with floors.  Solution: get rid of the floors, get rid of the wasted space.  My most important plants are under the floating platform with the walls protecting them. My arch is inside.  Everything else for the most part is outside and easily repaired though with the missile turrets I'm usually okay.  
---
If you're on PC and want to take a glance, look me up for an idea how you can get more room in your camp budget for things that I have a direct use.
---
I'm not happy with where my ammo converter is right now.  I just plopped it.  I'll need to work it in better.
---
This design has evolved since beta.  It was really inefficient at first, but in the latest version really packs a lot of a value in.
---
Every other trick really. The flamethrower is the best.
---
I hope this is a continued trend with following seasons, there are maybe 4 items i'd actually want in this season and I'm not grinding and playing every day to unlock one item that i actually want next season
---
wasnt this what fo76filthycasuals was for?
---
If I did, it would show
---
The Adrenaline perk is amazing, you should try maxing it. 60% damage increase is the same as three maxed weapon style perks. Psychobuff/psychotats will help a lot as well. 
---
Anti-armor is also quite good and will possibly become more popular with the damage nerfs from the PTS.
---
Yup , on public it’s still changing after each donation cycle
---
Honestly, I haven't noticed much difference, but I also don't really leave the Bog unless I have to.  
---
I'm not going through my stims than I expect so they're not hitting the T-65 harder than they should.  
---
The robots and super mutants I've fought as part of Daily Ops die about the same rate I expect them to, and my main gun is an AAE .50 Cal.  
---
The final boss in there is definitely a bullet sponge, but that feels like "by-design" given it doesn't tend to do much else, and the enemies all conveniently have stores of whatever I killed them with.  
---
Basically, the high level stuff is still about where it should be, and that's fine by me with my minimal active testing.  
---
I'm more concerned about the playability of the Ops and Earle Williams than damage numbers, incoming or outcoming, as either of those can be mitigated while stability and function is harder to resolve on my side.
---
I think it's nice and it's similar to how you can buy the Chinese stealth suit for bullion if you didn't progress through settlers up to making a faction choice and missed out. Gives people who are too late to make any major progress the chance to grind it out another way.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Sure thing.
---
👌🏽
---
&gt;because i dont take things so seriously and dont worship the gospel of Jim Sterling
---
Where do you get that from? Because I hate it doesn't mean I'm bumming Jim Sterling, I'm saying he was right about Bethesda cynical exploitation of Fallout fans.
---
I bought this game for £15 and I'm gutted.
---
what is the nerf?
---
it's consistent for me. 
---
also. it's not exactly a major problem IMO. You spawn inside a foundation. fast travel again and it usually puts you in a different spot.
---
I think this is the case for every bug
---
Keep in mind other companies was in on those earlier Beth games. And I’m sure a lot of the staff from back then is no longer “in”. But what do I know. 
---
If I may ask, what did you want from this post if you already deleted the game?
---
(Not trying to be an ass just curious)
---
i made it so people can get away from everybody complaining in this sub, i think that one is just for people who don’t take it seriously
---
Yup
---
if you genuinely didnt get £15 worth of fun when people paid 60 and did, that says more to me about you than the game tbh.
---
I have my Big Boy ready for when that day comes
---
To add to the previous comment, if the Mrs.doesnt have powered armor and uses NON-auto 10mm pistols she may need to equip action boy for AP regen, however if she can get 3-4 powered peices and keeps hydrated with the rejuvinated perk, than the AP regen will be sufficient.
---
She should try to get her hands on a pistol with lower vats cost and focusnon sneaky vats crit headshots.
---
where is this information please?  I keep seeing these posts but can't find the source.  Thank you in advance.
---
thanks for lmk
---
You can also pull the camera back in third person by holding the track pad and left joystick to zoom out!
---
&gt; Odly specific and forced you to go out of your way. Just like "take a picture in a rad storm",
---
There is a balance to it that requires a not impossible touch and your examples to my point kind of support that. I am not saying we need niche objectives out of left field like collecting X. Exploring new locations is organic and actually fun, and at level 252 I found two new locations last night because of nukashine. If you are saying the challenges are not oddly specific then I do not understand. A challenge I saw recently was collecting wood (I have thousands in my scrapbox, I dont need it/want to do it). Taking a picture in a radstorm leverages photo mode. The idea of photo mode is creativity and you choose the atmosphere and setup and I personally don't care for the challenges that require it like your example. But for another example, here is a challenge I have right now at this moment: Build a workshop or camp and requires 5 displays/shelves, 5 wall/floor decorations, 5 doors/stairs, 10 crops/water sources, 20 generators, lights, or power connectors. That is extremely specific and tedious when you already have a fully built camp like I do and need to accomplish that via workshops. I capture a workshop in an adventure server in 2 minutes. I will not be dumping those resources into a temporary workshop especially with disconnects and crashes being as prevalent as they are not to mention other players. It is at its core, a bad design for a challenge when you take into account how your users are playing the game. 
---
My ideas were spit out quickly in the moment and may not be 100% accountable to my argument, but I feel as though getting a floater freezer grenade which are currently rewarded constantly to everyone or obtaining a cryolator and freezing the queen just a single time is not an unreasonable challenge. It doesn't need to be that, but its a challenge that ties into other mechanics, benefits everyone in the situation, and gives you more to do than place 5 stairs when you there is no organic motivation to other than the checkbox for score. 
---
&gt; Challenges are not supposed to be a grind. They are supposed to make you want to play every day (or almost every day).
---
This ties back into my original essay and is the root cause of all the unhappiness. You want active players you make engaging bug free content. You do not make a time-gated mess that leverages a small daily time input for major rewards in a community already starved for them. It is a design flaw they keep trying to double down on instead of letting up on the tourniquet. Guild wars has a similar mechanic to encourage daily logins, for every day you log in continuously you receive a log-in reward up to the thirtieth time you log in and receive a chest with your choice of extremely rare crafting materials. Read up on it [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Login_rewards), a system like this would be a shoe-in for 76 and a much better alternative to daily challenges. 
---
&gt; Its like saying if you play my game I will give you candy. And I say awesome, I get to play AND get candy? Thats cool.
---
This mentality is the problem in my opinion. It overlooks that you actually do not get candy for "just playing the game". You get the candy after you haul ass to the basement where its full of bugs and flooded, and do 20 pushups while wearing a clown suit and only after you receive a single piece of root beer flavored hard candy. You only get the snickers after you do it 100 times. 
---
&gt; 2 months to get the ALL the candy? No, I want it NOW!
---
This is a mischaracterization of the complaints. Nobody is saying they want it now for no work, but that they want meaningful guaranteed progression on their own schedule. Settings long term goals an being rewarded is a very natural human behavior that should be encouraged. In spite of the rep grind for example, I maxed out both organically and now I literally have a negative reaction to ward/meg and their respective locations and random events because I did them consistently for so long. Even now as of this post, only 1.6% (per steam achievement tracker) of players are max rep with foundation. The grind is suppose to take a while, but given Wastelanders came out in May that seems a bit unreasonable.
---
Yeah, we need explosive weapons to be usable, it's a viable build that no one uses
---
its not so much a big deal on the wayward side of that intersection.. but if the circle is over the main road nobody can build next to overseers across the street.. 
---
its a minor peeve of mine
---
if people place their circles carefully that intersection can be built up really nice with several camps fairly close together
---
Look man. You replied 5 minutes after my original comment. If I edited something during debate, reddit would say something like 'this comment was edited x minutes ago' or something. If I edited before you made your first comment and you still misinterpreted, that means you didn't read my comment correctly in the first place. So there's that. I didn't edit nothing
---
Just wanted to post back to say I FOUND IT and thanks to everyone for the replies. Sure enough, it popped up at the Brotherhood Vendor Bot Phoenix in Watoga. Took me who knows how many server hopes, a couple dozen? Just got super unlucky with the RNG it seems.
---
Don’t go blowing your bullion just yet. I suspect that the Brotherhood will bring new gear to buy with it...
---
3 weeks, made back my £15 in time and tbh I feel I would have been better off replaying Fo2 instead.
---
I love Fallout and i really wanted to like it but it's gutting how this game has been out for nearly 2 years and it still plays like a beta.
---
Was it the “If you ever try to screw me oveeeeer…” one?
---
still stuck with this bug.
---
I mean, explosive damage needs a rework across the board.
---
No sir I did not. Those are my sincere feelings. It still requires players to earn the old items that in their time required a grind too but doesn't punish new players behind the gate of exclusives to older players. Locking things behind that gate only discourages new users.
---
I don't know if it still is but captain noob has a video where melee seemed to work the best.
---
Edit: wrong guy tagged, untagged now.
---
That’s correct. You didn’t edit nothing. You edited *something*.
---
👌🏽👍🏽
---
That's weird. Fixer is better in vats and worse in hipfire cause it does more damage and uses less ap but has worse recoil and control
---
The only hard part was near the end when about a dozen level 52 gutsies spawned in and liquified me with their armor ignoring guns.  No big deal though, since I could just respawn and walk back in and clean them out since they were already spawned.
---
I believe the nerf is the first step in multiple, we need balance to bring more builds to be viable
---
So it's my fault that I didn't enjoy it? Fuck me mate, that's a hot take.
---
That was a big rabbit hole, lol.
---
I didn't edit anything. You read wrong and are blaming it on me editing comments which I didn't do.
---
Finally people won't kill the toughest enemy (SBQ) in the entire game in 10 seconds.
---
So its basing all of the damaging effects upon the base damage on your weapon, instead of basing it upon the last 'damage effect' that was applied (eg. adrenal reaction). That's just wrong! Let's hope they don't do that to the Sneak multipliers as well. 
---
Imagine if they were true to that principle and did the same with the **sentinel** effect on each piece of armor, 15+15+15+15+15 = 75% of damage reduction from a full set (although each piece has only 75% chance to trigger that 15% damage reduction). 
---
If this damage effect nerf is for real where are the videos from youtuber's eg.Angry Turtle?
---
Yea not much complaining over there.
---
I mean I liked meeting other players but the gameplay just doesn't justify it.
---
After ten tries of Paired Keycard 01 not spawning for me (and since I always had to pick the lock to get to it, I'm fairly sure no one on the server got to it first), I'm guessing what happened was when Wastelanders DLC dropped, the Nuka Cola plant became an instanced interior (something you don't notice if you're playing solo) and whatever flag allows it to respawn was changed by the DLC.  
---
The only way to check is to find someone who hasn't gotten the card to group with,  and go into the plant to see if it spawns (for either of us).
---
If this update just makes enemies bullet sponges im done with this game 
---
Increased difficulty should be more damage to yourself not the other way round. 
---
A humanoid creature should not take 50 bullets to the head 
---
Colloidal problem should be spongy like the queen but not to the extent that you need 50k ammo to kill her off
---
Did we donate all the cork yet? Can’t check since on mobile currently
---
yeah i guess
---
Exactly my point they are not harder you juat waste more resources to kill them :V
---
They were in the atom shop data mine album and not the score album so I'm assuming it will be in the atom shop
---
I'm assuming it's like the screaming eagle skin (it's a recolor) so odds are it is a handmade skin
---
Depends on your level I would say. If you had no problems surviving before you definitely won’t have now either.
---
Most likely.
---
My only problem with this is mutations already are a buff by themselves. I would rather see it increased to 20-25% and just leave it at that
---
not at all what I'm saying. but it is your fault that you would rather give up on the game entirely after what i assume is a few hours of gameplay and post about how much you hated it on the internet than even try to find something enjoyable about it, or even just move on with your life.
---
anyone can- and does- find problems with this game. personally, i find it more fun to enjoy things.
---
This is perfect thank you ill make sure to keep all this in mind !
---
I just saw you edit a different comment in this thread. 
---
But whatever makes you feel better, bud 
---
And I shed no tears over someone getting banned for abusing a glitch, unlike you.
---
You do you...im in!
---
in hell, where they belong. giant enemy spiders would be a fat uninstall for little old me.
---
It hasn't updated since at least 7PM EST last night (was at 160/200m)
---
mmmm nice thinking
---
This is the problem here, there were enough people who put in time, end-game to get to high damage outputs for the bad rewards to be bearable as they could just do it again pretty quickly but making it harder to get shit rewards is just not fun, I am especially worried because of the one wasteland changes which will increase enemy levels and by extensions their health pools further
---
Damn glowing copperheads
---
I can’t imagine how many ammo I need to waste with my gauss minigun for a SBQ if they really do that. I’m junkies build and if my maths is right, my damage on pip boy will be 117 with full perk cards without demo which means I need to spend twice or triple ultracite 2mmEC which is estimated 3K for each SBQ event. Assume I can get 2 or 3 crimson flux per SBQ event, I don’t believe I’m able to afford a event costs me 30 crimson flux.
---
glad to have you in
---
*me constantly getting my ass kicked by lvl 60 gouls while level 4* please no
---
It will be close. Lvl 68 muties die with about 750 damage, not sure what those lvl 100 will take.
---
It's one of the random "mutation" effects you can get in the OPs
---
Fair enough, your opinion is as valid as mine.
---
Nah you have 25k karma. You know how comments and edits work obviously. You know I didn't edit cause if I did, it would show. Your initial reply was 5 minutes after my original comment :)
---
You do realize this is an rpg right? And rpgs have this basic element to them where you can progress, making your character and your gear stronger over time. Does this ring a bell?
---
All.previous "kill a thing with a thing" challenges could also be done by equipping that kind of weapon and killing it with a grenade
---
All explosives need a buff, they're terrible at damaging enemies.
---
Hahah true that. But it’s definitely better than no response
---
Honestly man you might be better of with a primed final word for the sbq. Not the solution you wanna hear. But alot cheaper to feed and AA does exceptionally well against her due to her %damage reduction on top of the high DR.
---
Although the new legendary ammo perk (even the 1st rank) will help you n out some.
---
Don’t forget that everything got nerfed to hell there, especially bloodied. Your character is doing 1/2-1/4 the damage it does on live servers. My Flamer alone dropped almost 75% of its damage
---
So far those are only good for pretty fireworks!
---
Doubling my ammo use from 1-2 bullets to 2-4 bullets is not going to be that big a deal. Most of the time so accidentally unload 3 bullets when 1 would do anyway.
---
if that was really the problem they could have had the buffs pre-calculated and added as another value which is only updated on some kind of timer and when weapons are equipped/de-equipped, no need to recalculate those multipliers then, just the dmg resistance calculation would be left and that can't be too hard if it works just fine and the damage multipliers really are the problem
---
Of course, it's not for everyone.
---
I know they said solo or group, but I don’t know how any stealth build, or unoptimized build, is supposed to solo these.  Without sneak attack boosts, a rifleman is basically useless, and commando is hamstrung pretty badly.  Unarmed got destroyed with the damage adjustments, so what’s left besides power armor with a giant machine gun?
---
I might just run these Daily Ops with my junkies heavy gunner, and do the season challenges/xp farming with my rifleman.
---
Seen lv 20 radrats survive a 2 shot mirv!

And I started typing the reply before that five minute time frame. 
---
I’ve got fast fingers, but not that fast. 
---
That’s how linear time works.
---
Yeah me too 😂.
---
One guy cleared out three of us, all high level, bonded, sharing good cards that wouldn't interfere with builds.
---
Yea i get kicked every now and again but its not too often. I dont care if you are lwvel 1 or 1000 as long as you aren't playing loud music or being annoying you can stay in the team.
---
What was your handmade? What mods did you use? VATS or no VATS?
---
i only join a team when required for a daily and typically quit as soon as I achieve it..
---
I cant say that I recall ever being kicked out
---
I saw on Juicesheads last video that apparently Bethesda are working on something PvP for the future, probably no time soon, but something is in the works
---
What's a Jim Sterling?
---
The micro nuke doesn't actually do 2k damage though, explosive damage is bugged and the splash damage overwrites the actual primary damage!
---
I had a two shot fatman. Ran around launching two nukes at a time in random directions
---
&gt;The bomb drops and the SBQ shows up.  Again, I struggle to get above those numbers.  I don't think anyone else is having significantly better luck either as the health bar slowly whittles by.
---
Oh god, I am not looking forward to longer SBQ fights.
---
To be fair, who doesn’t drink 5 full bottles of water every time they get thirsty? (6 times a day)
---
Use a private server.
---
I feel like they wouldn’t mesh with the world right
---
Or early game...
---
That means I edited my comment to back up my thoughts even before this whole debate started. Wow didn't know I had the ability to see ahead of time
---
As a regular Fed76 user I love this change. Thank you guys!
---
Hehe I’m glad I’m not the only one it annoys. Argh now that would really have got me mad. It’s called public teams for a reason.
---
I was surprised how many random kills I was getting lol
---
Oh yeah that one is horrifying
---
&gt; But this complaining isn't feedback.
---
Yes, it is. It is exactly that.
---
&gt; It would be so if Bethesda had to do something to fix the "issue". But the issue isn't on the devs side. The devs implemented a system
---
Exactly. The developers implemented a system. A lot of players don't like the system, as is apparent from the upvotes on the threads complaining about the daily challenges. That is the issue, and it is an issue with the game. That implemented system in the game is making people burn out. The way Bethesda can "fix" this, is by listening to the feedback, and making changes to the system they implemented.
---
&gt; But you dont have to. Turns out, the repeatable challenge makes up for it more than we thaught.
---
Yes, that's exactly the issue; we thought, and still think, that we need to do all the daily challenges, because it isn't immediately apparent from the system how many days we can skip doing the challenges, and it's worse for those people who can play maybe like once or twice a week, because of their busy work schedules, and so on. Those people might have like 10-15 hours to spend playing Fallout 76 on those days that they do get to play, which would be plenty to get all of the dailies done for that week, but it doesn't help, since all they've got available are the challenges for that day, aside from the weeklies, and the repeatable XP farm, and having to do the incredibly boring (in comparison to the variety of the challenges) XP farm for several hours just to compensate for all the S.C.O.R.E. lost from the days when they can't play will burn them out even worse.
---
&gt; So people saying that they are burnt out from the Legendary Run need to realize that it was their own fault. Expecting Beth to do something about that is nonsense.
---
No, it's not nonsense just because you personally think it is. Plenty of people are burnt out with the Legendary Run, and a big part of that is the feeling of needing to log on every single day to play the game. You can repeat that it's "their own fault" all you like, but that's the system that has been implemented, and that's what it does to people.
---
&gt; Finally, no you cant have daily challenges that last a week.
---
Of course you can.
---
&gt; Then they would be weekly challenges but in a weird way.
---
So? Change the name of the daily challenges to minor challenges and weekly challenges to major challenges, then change the system so that the minor challenges stay until the weekly reset. Problem solved. Everyone's happy.
---
&gt; They are actively trying to get you to play every day. I realize some of you dont want to play every day.
---
Well, it's good that you realize that some people, quite a lot of people actually, don't want to feel like they're forced to log in to do chores every day. You will probably also then realize that those people have the right to voice that opinion as feedback to Bethesda, without someone trying to tell them to shut up.
---
Also, just out of curiosity, what exactly *is* your personal problem with this? Surely, if you had the freedom to do the challenges at your own pace, instead of having to log in every day - which you still could do, if you so chose, obviously - to do the chores, it would be a better option. If you want to wage war against people who whine about Bethesda, Fallout 76 and Todd, there are plenty of people out there who you can target. In the meanwhile, maybe you could let people who have an actual issue with an implemented system in the game voice their opinions and give their feedback without trying to shut them up?
---
Yeah they’d probably just clip constantly through the ground and be impossible lol
---
Yes it happened twice once I crafted t65 with jet pack I could not leave no matter what. So I leave server and come back and I could
---
These end game bosses are not intended to be soloed. It should be a huge achievement to solo one of these bosses, the fact that it’s casual talk because every player can solo the queen says something about  how unbalanced the PvE is. I think the damage nerf will be good on it’s own idk about a damage nerf AND one wasteland update we will just have to see I guess
---
How? I’d love to know how.
---
Oh, and by the way, I just picked up 8 pints of milk, I guess you can have 4.
---
Yep!
---
I’m not low level so I know that’s not why I’m getting kicked. Loud music and eating over the mic are a definite no and you deserved to be kicked for that.
---
Doubt it will make a difference, but you are correct.
---
Snakes are hard to make in video games
---
I’d really want that space power armor skin, as I’m pretty sure there is no chance I’ll reach it before the season ends. T_T
---
people be regretting hard
---
Yeah It sucks I can’t even share perks anymore after I switched all perks around. I went from 8 charisma to 1
---
It's pretty common. Sometimes you can wait a few minutes or fast travel somewhere else. Otherwise you will have to relog.
---
&gt;not at all what I'm saying.
---
&gt;that says more to me about you than the game tbh
---
Funny that because that's exactly what you said.
---
&gt;but it is your fault that you would rather give up on the game entirely after what i assume is a few hours of gameplay and post about how much you hated it on the internet than even try to find something enjoyable about it, or even just move on with your life.
---
Are you possessed? I played this piece of shit for 3 weeks to give it a chance but it only existed to let me down. I deleted it this morning but the flagrant exploitation of Fallout fans by Bethesda is truly disgusting. I seriously question your taste if you're this much of an arse about a differing opinion on a game considered to be one of the worst of 2018. Fuck me.
---
For addictions, look at the bottom of https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Addiction and pick the 5 you can handle the best. But...
---
I'd wait for now. Based on what's going on on the PTS *right now*, Anti-Armor may become the new hotness.
---
In terms of weapons to use, I don't like the energy weapons for numerous reasons, so I'd say Gatling Gun as your everyday ammo-efficient weapon, 50cal for bigger bosses or fast enemies or hordes of enemies (the higher fire rate gives it higher DPS, but you burn a lot more ammo and it's much less accurate). The Gauss Minigun is the "best" of the ballistic damage weapons (although it's not *purely* ballistic...) in pure DPS, but the best mods reduce the range to 120! and the ammo crafts in 1/3rd the amount of 5mm/50cal
---
For perks, look up nukesdragons.com and link your build there; we can then give you advice on what to move based on your full current build.
---
I’ve got all 5 characters filled and my melee has always been a great ammo getter for the rest.
---
I'd get excited, but I'm sure we'll be let down in some way.
---
I'm pretty sure it still highlights them. The Targeting HUD on Power Armor also has the same effect and description but it still highlights turrets and robots.
---
I just have. And at first glance you would be right, but that’s because the Fixer comes with a Calibrated receiver as standard, the combat rifle does not. 
---
Comparing against the Prime receiver values it shows that you were overstating (but as much as I thought)
---
Weapon - Base, Prime Semi, Prime Auto
---
Combat Rifle - 60, 75, 69
---
Fixer - 72, 87, 81
---
For it to be 20% those numbers needed to be 72, 90, 83
---
For comparison
---
Handmade - 68, 84, 75
---
So Fixer is the better Auto weapon by a good margin, Handmade makes for a solid Semi-Auto DPS weapon (bets out the LAR in DPS)
---
It's a score reward
---
Oh no you’re missing out on loads of good extras. Depending on what team you pick you get added xp and also free travel points to players camps and tents. Also the shared cards is a bonus too. I usually like to be solo but I’m never going back now.
---
Sometimes completing the dailies can take about an hour or more. Many times I want to do other things but cant because dailys take priority and time is limited by responsibilities, I cannot spend 3+ hours every day doing that. Took a month to rebuild my base and get around to wastlanders DLC because I was too occupied with season 1 to actually do them.
---
I still play the game and enjoy doing extra things, but on these days I rack up some serious game time which isnt sustainable in the long run.
---
I understand that. However there’s no point for not using my favourite weapons in game but I can’t really use it if they really do that. I’m not a YouTuber who try to do solo SBQ or coming colossal wendigo and I’m spending almost 1K-2K ultracite 2mmEC each SBQ event now which means this hungry weapon is already expensive to feed and I can’t imagine how many people would be still using this weapon if they really do it.
---
“Please don’t make an iconic weapon usable”
---
It would have been nice to get a new weapon added in the form of the service rifle, and give people a camo skin for it to simulate the All American.  The BOS could have found a cache of them and sold them to people that did their faction quests, like the Gauss weapons for the others.  Missed opportunity here and lazy effort if it's just a skin for existing weapons.
---
Haven’t tried my heavy gunner, but my handmade was pushing close to 300. It’s 170ish now.
---
If you edit a comment within the first three minutes it doesn’t show an edit tag.

You clarified your intention between the time I saw your post and the time I made my first reply. 
---
If you edit a post while someone is looking at the post, it doesn’t update in real time. They’d have to reload the page/content to see the edit.
---
I like the way you articulated your criticism of legendary system. I agree with this. 
---
I’m actually ok with the “nerf” I think in theory. I’m not in the PTS so I can only go off of how it’s been described. 
---
I like your idea of moving that stealth mutation into the randomized mix
---
I can only share 1 point😭
---
Im not going to continue to engage with you. You have clearly made up your mind and wont listen to oposing views. Continue complaining all you want.
---
all explosive weapons need a bit more punch IMO
---
Not for dailies, junk, or events if you want rare rewards.
---
I'm level 221 and I'm still always hanging out in the forest quite a bit.

an explosive affect would make it much better those are OP on shotguns

It happened to me once recently. Switched servers and it was fine.
---
and i question your priorities if you decide to, as i already said, bitch about a game on the internet instead of MOVING ON WITH YOUR LIFE. what did you think would happen, posting this in a place where most like the game? i think you were posting this in some moronic attempt to get attention, and I am more than happy to deliver it. so by all means, inslut me again.
---
Ooooh. Well, this isn’t a challenge, this is literally “won’t die except to melee damage”.
---
Given that a gun bash kills it but a gun bullet doesn’t, yeah, I don’t think it works like you’re asking,
---
The changes aren't that cut and dry.
---
I have various characters that range from a bloodied stealth commando, to a junkies heavy gunner to several non legendary builds.
---
All of them suck in the PTS, except the bloodied and magic weapons (yes, they still work and now there's more of them).
---
The non meta builds *really* suck though. It took about 10 minutes and hundred and hundreds of rounds of 5.56 from a non legendary handmade to almost down a level 100 scorchbeast... except it flew away before I was done. My bloodied character still took about 2 minutes to down a scorchbeast, most of which was getting it to land, but it still takes about 75-100 rounds to down one with a B2525 handmade (with it landed, at point blank range).
---
The only reason people are flocking to Two Shot and Anti Armor are because some of them now also benefit from the magic damage bug that was previously only on other prefixes. Two shot much more easily triggers the magic effect though.
---
If you watch the in-game damage numbers, two shot and AA both display numbers well below bloodied.  AA is close to half bloodied and so is two shot (combining the shots) but when the bug kicks in they zip health down the same way a J25 LMG does (which, BTW still is magic in the PTS and is the only weapon I had that still drops a scorchbeast in seconds)
---
Something else I noticed... there's a new damage bug that causes severe damage lag that's really effecting all guns that do high damage, no matter the prefix.
---
Several times doing the daily OP and when fighting other level 100 enemies in the open world I would fire a burst of maybe 6 shots into an enemy with a B2525 handmade and their health would go down to half, and then after I would stop firing a second later the rest of the health would disappear and they'd die. This was really inconsistent though. Maybe 25% of the time it happened, the other 75% their health would stay at half or go down to near zero but not kill them. It seems like bloodied still has a lot of power but it's registering late and sometimes the game discards it like the calculation got lost in the mail.
---
It seems like single shot/semi auto guns suffer most from this, because if you fire two shots at an enemy that they should have killed, sometimes the game lags applying the second hit and sometimes it seems to just lose it entirely. This means shotguns in VATS too, even magic ones.
---
Also, in an hour of playing today 4 out of 5 of my armor pieces broke from 200% repair and my various guns broke from 150% repair about 7 or 8 times.
---
Just during the Daily Op mission both of my primary guns I took in (TSE Assault rifle and B2525 handmade both modded for max durability bar) each broke 3 times.
---
During the boss fight, where I was only fighting the boss, my guns each broke once after being repaired with improved repair kits during the fight, and using cover as much as possible to keep from being hit. The higher damage from the new scaling enemies just shreds durability like nothing I've seen yet in this game.
---
Speaking of incoming damage... bloodied is still just as tanky as it was before and it was easier for me to keep on two feet using my full bloodied defense perk setup than it was for me to use full health. Granted, I didn't have a set of vanguard armor to swap out, but I had 300DR and ER anyway. They take such big chunks of your health with each hit though that even at full health it's like 3 hits and you're toast. Max level serendipity at least gives  you a good chance to totally negate some of the hits.
---
Oh and also my really awesome B33 M79 that was the only M79 I ever liked now sucks just like the rest of them, although I imagine a regular M79 is even worse now than it was before.
---
So, TLDR, I'll be sticking with my bloodied build but likely using a bugged magic junkies or magic two shot weapon. Assuming they don't fix those or make changes to this mess.
---
So yeah, while I welcome the added difficulty for my meta build they really need to do something about the condition loss problem and also do something about the fact that this makes the game really ammo grindy, especially for people not using meta builds. Even with the new ammo methods I still burned through 10x more ammo on my bloodied character than before and about 20X more ammo on my non bloodied (although I avoided some fights on purpose with those which helped too).
---
I have an instigating explosive combat, it's fucking great. Hope they never nerf "magic" damage on shotguns though.
---
Yeah I feel bad man. Everyone usually sharing good stuff and I can’t. I use to share two perks but I fell in love with stealth commando bloodied so oh well. I played solo for a year and a half so I guess it doesn’t bother me if I have to. But when I’m in a group and we’re bonded I don’t get why I get kicked. Oh well
---
I dont even know why they put pocketed and deep pocketed together for example. Who the hell gonna buy 5lb upgrade over 10
---
I'd rather have people complaining, so Bethesda will hopefully get annoyed at their consumers complaining about they're broken product so frequently that they'll actually hopefully fix it. If no on complains about stuff not working, its not going to get fixed
---
It's three minutes not 3\~5 :). Nice try tho
---
I’ve got all 5 character slots filled. It’s definitely made my marginal builds useless. I just ran my bloodied gunslinger on the PTS. He’ll be my official mule from now on.
---
That is definitely one of the few things that Bethesda has gotten right.
---
Unfortunately it’s still a full priced game (though I suppose you can get it for like 10 bucks nowadays) so there’s definitely a pressure that they can’t charge for their battle pass.
---
Wait, a war glaive? I really hope it's the polearm sort of glaive, would love a bladed two-handed weapon that was a bit more than just a...pointy short stick or a pool cue with a knife taped to it.
---
ok
---
deal with it I killed a scorchbeast at level 27 by myself.
---
Only thing I can think of is completionist but they would never use it
---
Min/maxers. The death of all fun in multiplayer games
---
See what I did there?  
---
No edit tag.
---
And thanks for confirming my point. 
---
You know you have time to edit it and you’re denying you did. And you know that it won’t look like you edited it because you did it the time frame. 
---
I loaded this thread before you edited your comment, and it showed you had posted it 1m prior. After reading the OP and the other comments, I replied to yours.  
---
You edited your comment between the time I loaded the thread and the 3 minute mark hit.
---
Defo not for me anyway, I only wish I could get a refund.
---
Don't bring those into the game. I'm absolutely not ready for some god damn panic attacks.
---
Damage increasing effects are now additive not multiplicative on PTS. Resulting big nerf on **all** damage, **all** prefixes. Bloodied gets hit worst as it uses several different multipliers. But it is still the best damage build/prefix. You can find more info on official PTS forums.
---
That isn’t a good reason to kick someone. Not everyone shares perks or I find everyone shares the same. I occasionally join straight back if I’m kicked to see if it was on purpose as I take it quite personally😂
---
Still same ( 20 minutes ago )
---
Same here. I used one of my legendary slots on the PTS for Charisma. Now I can share too.
---
That is lovely. These builds are my faves. I found a department store two nights ago, so cool.
---
A reviewer hating anything AAA
---
Some PTS tester said, it will be fixed with Patch22.
---
It's fixed on PTS
---
Really? I can't check but I thought base damage for combat rifle was somewhere around 30\~40. Maybe remove damage perks and see if it changes anything? Fixer is datamined to do 20% more damage
---
I don’t know what weapons are you using man. In my case, I’m using my junkies gauss minigun and I spend 2K ultracite 2mmEC every single SBQ in 15 minutes now. What happen if they nerf my build? Of course you could suggest me to not use this hungry weapon on SBQ or coming colossal problem, so what enemy would you advise me to deal with this expensive weapon? On a normal mob?
---
Because then nuking things would be way to easy. It’s supposed to be hard to launch a nuke.
---
Would be nice to get a plain skin for it.
---
Sounds good to me than thank you hopefully they do some small tweakes before launching this update.
---
Well, feel free to add me \_Hades. and join our community on discord, i'd gladly help you out with whatever i can and you need that i can give. You will also find al ot of helpful people here, as we are one of the biggest communities around. [https://discord.gg/EK9cbH](https://discord.gg/EK9cbH)

Some mobs will have a minimum level. SBQ will not become level 1 to a low level player.

That means no naked person fresh out of the vault should be able to fist a death claw.

if you have xbox it is on gamepass (at least for now)
---
I got kicked from my team yesterday... and I was the one who created the public team.
---
Not sure how that happened
---
&gt;and i queation your priorities if you decide to, as i already said, bitch about a game on the internet instead of MOVING ON WITH YOUR LIFE.
---
Because it's exploitation you clod, fuck me, it seems if Todd took a shit on your face you'd lick it off and ask for seconds.
---
&gt;what did you think would happen, posting this in a place where most like the game?
---
Are you ok? 3 out of the top 5 posts of the month on this subreddit are criticising the game but I can't?
---
I'm fucked off because I've invested money into a company that wouldn't piss on you or me if we were on fire, Jesus.
---
Yeah cause you edited within 3 minutes :)
---
That's 130 damage you lost, 43.3%
---
I just want the option to kill her.
---
True but at this point it's almost impossible to take her down without hacked weapons, magic weapons, or literally the entire server due to the extremely low amount of damage EVERYONE now does and the fact that she negates 70% of that damage as well as having 300 dr and er
---
Or you could just look at the imgur links people posted yesterday instead of a video.

Oh I forgot about Gamepass. That’s like what $5 a month or something so it’s probably the cheapest option. (Ignoring all the other games you get with game pass lol)
---
I am a heavy weapon PA guy, but I do agree, the anti-sneak mutation should be on a daily random pool.
---
Except they also add mutations to the Daily Ops mobs.  I would expect if that goes well we will be seeing more of that other places.
---
Quest... Pull out her voice modulator
---
gunfu i'm not sure of. concetrated fire no, adrenaline yes
---
Were you solo or in a team?
---
I was having a rough time trying it solo, I didn't notice till after that it's a new team type to join people for that.
---
Solo it's rough just getting back to the dead enemies to loot them before more spawn and kill you. I was using a handmade, and every time I would respawn there were enemies on top of me aggro already and my weapon was empty. So it was pretty terrible trying to just get back into the fight. They need to make you respawn with a full weapon at least, I think.
---
I’ve enjoyed the level 100 enemies. I’ve received over 700xp on level 100 super mutant gladiators.
---
I am not enjoying the amount of ammo I’m going through though. My melee build is gonna be busy collecting bullets!
---
Time to get ourselves some Executioner's swing-speed melee weapons, fellas.
---
i made it so people can escape all the complaining, if you don’t like the idea, simply don’t join the sub
---
I had no damage perks. I already removed them to get as clean data as I could.
---
And so did you. 
---
Read my newest edit to the comment you just replied to. 
---
All of that was done within the time frame. So you could have easily edited a few words in two minutes. 
---
You just keep proving my point. You had plenty of opportunity to edit your comment between when I loaded the thread and your three minute time limit.
---
There are chickens inside the coop
---
My tent still works fine there. but i haven't moved in about a month.
---
Ok I'm sorry to revive an old thread, but I'm new to 76 and have been using broken chinese stealth armor for my berserkers build. Is this the way to go?
---
Weekend, do interns work on weekends?
---
That cannot be killed for meat.
---
There’s no serious work involved in creating any build in this game and people need to stop saying that. A casual player or a hardcore player it doesn’t matter, it’s not like only hardcore players run bloodied builds therefore they are elite and top tier builds. No, just no. This game is just plain easy once you get the hang of it it doesn’t matter if your addicted to chems or about to mutate into a ghoul with all your rads, if you know the game well you can breeze through everything with non legendary weapons and some wood armor. People are upset that easy peasy mode is getting nerfed stop beating around the bush and making excuses for it. This game needed a serious change like this and bloodied is just cheap and stupid when you do that much damage and can be as tanky as power armor low health doesn’t matter. This nerf seems like it will balance out gameplay a little bit but they still need to work on enemy balancing hopefully that comes with one wasteland.
---
Some of the stuff marked as season  isn't in the season and some stuff in the season isn't shown on that list.
---
Sounds like that's a good way to go, but I wasn't aware stealth armor could break
---
Ugh I just started a char just for melee. At least I don’t have many points in yet.
---
I always loved maxing out caps at slots in Fallout 1 and 2.
---
I saw a full 17 minutes video, the maker shpwed us every score reward from the new table. One of the later reward is the skin you mentioned. 70-80ish range.
---
Yeah but it constantly changes based off range, where you hit an enemy, if adrenaline is active, and how many pellets from shotguns connect. Too many factors to keep a baseline equation constant. This is why shotguns have always had this rubber band the worse
---
Aye it does, ty sir
---
I’m on Xbox unfortunately! In the same boat as you!
---
Melee used to be, but that got hit hardest by the nerf!
---
Lol so maybe I’m not always being kicked on purpose. I think like that and it might not get me so mad.
---
Well, they can do that to the Deathclaw, but they probably won't enjoy it too much. Probably not a good ending. 
---
But everything is correct.
---
I think it comes down to a few things:
---
1. Nobody likes seeing power or wealth that they have amassed taken from them. It feels bad and this is a well understood psychological phenomenon (see loss aversion bias)
---
2. There are so many things that Bethesda could be working on now, like fixing the literally hundreds of bugs or creating a more diverse and less grindy endgame.
---
3. Nobody was asking for a nerf. If anything, we were asking for MORE viable builds so that not every powerful build was Bloodied or Junkies.
---
In the span of two weeks, Bethesda has outraged CAMP enthusiasts and min/maxers, both significant pools of their longtime player base. It just reinforces to me that they have zero connection to the player base and are totally out of touch.
---
I have played some really poorly run live service games (hellgate, destiny, the division), and this may be the most clueless and disconnected I have ever seen the leadership of a game.
---
at level 20 I was already part of the enclave,  killed 5 deathclaws, and explored half the mire. I killed a scorchbeast at 27 and until level 25 I had issues with stimpacks. I NEVER  had issues with radaway.
---
I’m already at level 100 in the run, I’m keeping all my cork thank you, already donated 1K of it
---
But your first reply was made after 5 minutes of my original posting and if I edited anything after you started saying something, it would show. So there's that
---
THIS is genuine input and is what needs to be reported to beth on how it performs and thoughts. Thank you for taking the time to write this. I hope you voice your concerns over at the Beth official forum.
---
Your response is what we need more of. The whiners saying  the ITs A BuLLeT spOnGe, no OnE WaNts BUlet sPonGE ,or "you made my bloodeed bad" are not constructive nor helpful.
---
It's very unlikely if you stick to popular well supported mods.

How is the two shot Fatman? Do the nukes land distant from each other?

I have sold the paddle ball for 10k on two occasions. First I put it in as a joke second... well why not. A simple Google search is what I do before a purchase if I don't know what it is.
---
This game also runs like shit on PC. I can get a solid 60 fps when walking out in the bush or something. If I'm in a town or an area with a lot of assets my fps starts taking big hits. Also turing the camera too fast results in major stutters that sometimes lock up the game for 1-3 seconds and may result in a crash to desktop. P,S I have above recommend specs and lowering graphics settings and even tweaking inis barley helps
---
Oh yes 6% of the community can solo the Queen with a perfect build and an ultra rare legendary, so the rest of the community has to suffer!
---
There are many holes in reality. Be careful where you step as you may be sucked into an alternate dimension
---
&gt;Keep in mind other companies was in on those earlier Beth games.
---
That makes sense.
---
&gt;If I may ask, what did you want from this post if you already deleted the game? (Not trying to be an ass just curious)
---
No it's ok, I get it. I'm pissed off because after 2 years, this game, *to* *me*, is still a buggy, incomplete mess. You only have to look at the top posts on this very subreddit to see evidence of this.
---
I love Fallout but I'm annoyed that I spent money and time on this and I feel that the sentiment belongs on here as much as any positive post.
---
Exactly lol the issue is with people just not wanting to learn about the game or think about an optimized build so they just pick random cards and wonder why they suck. This game is easy if you know what you’re doing you don’t need cheap and tactless builds that are op to accomplish anything in this game except role playing as god.
---
ah, yes, the "i like the fallout 76, so i must be Todd Howard's bitch" comment. was wondering when you'd get to that. the issue isn't you criticising the game, it's you constantly devolving your attitude. i say i dont care for what jim sterling says- which i did mention another anti-76 youtuber by the way, so its not like i was singling out your mention of him specifically- and you began being a little shit. so, for fun, i decided to reciprocate. and look where we are now. continue being a shit, and i will do the same. or, and i know this is a pretty tough concept for you, you can let it go and just move on with your life.
---
i started this comment thread disagreeing with you by simply saying "dont care, i still have fun", and then saying that sometimes it isnt any more complicated than just liking a game. you're the one who took me disliking a damn internet reviewer as a personal attack.
---
i look forward to your next comment calling me more names, which i will then reply with more names since apparently you just want an argument.
---
I had 11 points in strength before realizing it.
---
Yes they nerf bloodied badly and all other builds are nerfed too. Bloodied will still outdamge the others, I think they are pushing the others to turn to bloodied as the other builds will become really useless.
---
they could still simplify by grouping perk,special and aid-items damage multipliers into a constant baseline in order to reduce the load for calculation
---
I've heard having a new character can do it, but I haven't tried it yet.
---
I kicked a guy today, he was having a party with his friends with the mic on .. after 5 minutes it became unbearable
---
Lucky Hole Mines has A LOT of Lead Ore mining nodes. And if you mine nodes while in Excavator, you get more Ore. So get them all, Smelt it into Lead Scrap, which in turn you can make a lot of Ammo.
---
Bethesda really needs to make an option for player vendors to sell a stack of things, as 1 bullet for 1 cap is too much. 1 bullet for .5 cap is the going rate on Discord. Unless it's Ultracite Ammo.
---
Just go drink from the white springs fountain like the rest of us. 
---
Privileged.
---
I moved 3 camps after last patch. One of them I had to rebuild 3 times. It was a pain.
---
well of course, you need gamepass ultimate as 76 is online but it also allows many other games
---
Everyone should have unlimited junk stash.
---
I hate spiders but I'm oddly fascinated with exaggerated, fantasy versions of them.  
---
So yeah, sure.
---
Yes, they split evenly side by side. Big blast radius, terrible direct hit numbers. Splash damage is better
---
Only mods for the sacrificial blade apparently, I've heard rumors of a plan, but only from rare forest event drops.
---
Way less countries ban RDR2 than GTAO. You can't create anything on a global scale without issues with some countries.
---
That's weird. Them where did that 20\~30 damage per shot come from?
---
The wall/doorway thing is being fixed on tuesday
---
&gt;ah, yes, the "i like the fallout 76, so i must be Todd Howard's bitch" comment. was wondering when you'd get to that. the issue isn't you criticising the game, it's you constantly devolving your attitude. i say i dont care for what jim sterling says- which i did mention ankthet anti-76 yiutuber by the way, so its not like i eas singling out your mention of him specifically- and you began being a little shit. so, for fun, i decided to reciprocate. and look where we are now. continue being a shit, and i will do the same. or, and i know this is a pretty tough concept for you, you can let it go and just move on with your life.
---
Just stop. I bought a product and said product is not up to my expectations end of. You're the one that went on the attack first because you equate me criticising the game as criticising you. Which I didn't until you gave me reason to.
---
&gt;i look forward to your next comment calling me more names, which i will then reply with more names since apparently you just want an argument.
---
Twat, wanker, knobhead. Happy?
---
Argh that’s my other pet hate. Listening to someone having a domestic or just saying offensive things to get a reaction. Kick them off pronto.
---
This means we’re one step closer to the fight between the enclave and the BoS! Even if Bethesda doesn’t directly have a quest line that leads up to this, I am DEFINITELY giving them a good nuking when they arrive!
---
WRONG, all it takes is the woodbe thief to have a laggy Internet connection.
---
Yeah it’s a consistent issue for me and people I know, I have been building for a while and moving the camp does not affect the spawn location of the player if he teleports to a player inside the camp.
---
Well to be fair you don’t need any of that to solo the queen. Enough ammo, stims, and patience with any max weapon perk build and you can solo the queen. And that’s why I agree with the nerf. Force some teamwork against these bosses in team events that are focused on team work lol
---
Ah I think I heard of someone getting the plans from Teatime, it’s one of those super rare plans.
---
My daily challenges didn’t reset today either. First time this as happened to me. I was playing over the reset time at noon though.  I think I’m at rank 96 so I’m not hugely concerned. But it’s an annoyance for sure
---
I'm glad I've spent 10 modules to make the SS torso and ended with 4 or 5 three star ones, 3 of which I am keeping. But I feel your pain.
---
I have no cork! I was able to donate 3000 steel and will donate thousands of wood plastic and ceramic but I don't even have 250 cork
---
Supposed to be fixed on Tuesday according to this week’s ITV
---
Hard to keep a team supplied for a boss fight if every weapon in the game has been nerfed into oblivion.
---
I can't even log into a private server been trying for a couple of hrs every now and then to see if it finally works but so far it just disconnects me from the server 🙄
---
I would like the changes if they did not mess up the meta SO HARD right now a TSE handmade at full hp will do more damage than a bloodied explosive handmade at 20% hp now, so I am running at 20% hp to do less damage then the person with full health and a TSE. To have grinded as as long as I have for my weapons and made my build I think you can see why this bothers me a lot, my weapon makes me take more risk for less reward really?
---
That’s a lot of damage, as the kids say.
---
Yeah I had someone messaging me about what a filthy scammer I was because my vendor didn’t work. He made posts about it on fb apparently, even though he got his caps back later on
---
I mean "to make them viable".
---
well they can safely shoot it by exploiting its melee only nature I know I killed 5 by level 20 and was a member of  the enclave at 18
---
because everyone is afraid of the glitches
---
If I clear an area in a private server, there is no new loot for at least 48 hours. Are you describing something different?
---
It would be fun to sit at a poker or blackjack table with other people.
---
Nope. Don't have 1st either but just completed one with the bug.
---
I mean they might even do that and the server still might not be able to keep up. This is all my speculation from my observations of the game, I am no developer so I could be completely wrong on this idea.
---
They work from home..
---
I made a post about this yesterday, to get around it you need to complete it in a private server (yours or someone else) doesn't matter.
---
funny how you dont aknowledge your own part in this. that is not at all how this began. i see you edited into you main post how "you arent criticising you as people", yet it was you who took "i dont listen to Jim Sterling as gospel" and replied in the defensive, as if i accused you of doing so. all i meant was that i dont listen to the BS so-called "reviewers" put on the internet to get ad revenue. YOU took me criticising a youtuber as me criticising YOU. and i decided if you were going to be a prick, i was gonna have fun with it.
---
and yes, i am very happy. the more time you waste on me, the less you waste being an angry punk elsewhere.
---
Ahh thats good, thanks for letting me know!
---
Never saw a problem. It always killed me when I tried to use it. 100% effective.
---
I appreciate it. So essentially all daamage is just nerfed. The order of prefixes hasnt changed?
---
Well considering the canvas bag and Nuka Dark debacle, I think he has excellent reason to criticise Bethesda's sinister business practices.
---
Yes! I really like this. I’ve got a load of gold that I have nothing to do with and I doubt I’m gonna hit lvl100 so this is good
---
As someone who hasn’t been able to play a Colossal Problem at all I’m really jealous that you guys get to play it at all. They really pulled a dirty one on us with this recent patch :(
---
With 8 people? Lol that’s a lot of ammo. If one person can solo these bosses as it is now I don’t think we should have any problems taking these bosses down in an 8 person team even with the nerf. Looks like people are dependent on this easy mode that is the bloodied and junkies build. Can’t live without it, just sad.
---
That’s bizarre. It refreshes every 24 hours for me. I usually log in at 10pm when I finish work each night and the spawns usually refresh.
---
Maybe that was Bethesdas plan all along, you wanna complete the game ya need fallout plus. Lol not really but i wouldn't put it past them.
---
Sometimes they will not have issues. I have issues with high level feral ghouls but almost nothing else (I was able to beat a scorchbeast by myself I cant't beat 2 charred feral ghouls by myself without exploiting pathing) and I'm level 27 and I explored half the mire and a good portion of the savage divide
---
They’re in Australia’s wasteland *where they belong*
---
If the Colossus is stronger i hope the timer is longer than 30min
---
Also outside of  a few boss enemies like these the enemies are a joke and ridiculous damage builds needed to be reigned in
---
We already have a Gambling System it's called The *Purveyor* Murmrgh at the Rusty Pick. And you use Script to Gamble with.
---
I use your site on a constant basis. Great idea and great work!
---
Sometimes I have that bug and I have to log out and back in.
---
&gt; The order of prefixes hasnt changed
---
correct
---
In times like these to spam for BoS? You have balls.
---
Feels bad, man.
---
Out of interest, what perks should I avoid sharing?
---
I tend to have 2 ranks of barbarian shared. I figured a bit extra toughness is a good general bonus. (Does anyone berserker?)
---
alright ty
---
Makes post asking for only one gender xD instead of just nice players that you can just jam with. Not all men are pigs. Just saying... can't have this both ways.
---
Forgot to change your alt?
---
Woah woah woah this is Bethesda. They can’t fix both otherwise something even worse will pop up
---
well to be honest if they didn't group it there would probably not be too much benefit in switching from multiplication to addition as the dynamic aspect of those that you mentioned still applies there
---
/u/JPeralta98 is right, for some reason it works on a fresh private server. If you are on PC send me a PM with your in game name and I guess I can help with that if you have no other option.
---
Enemies, yes. The scrap in the structure near my camp, no.
---
meh
---
Lone Wanderer for life yo..
---
That’s not how it works. If you *start* an edit and the page has already loaded for me, I only see the data at the state it was in at the time the page loaded. 
---
Let me break it down for you. 
---
- 0:00 You make your comment.
---
- 0:01 I load up the page and all the comments **IN THEIR CURRENT STATE** are displayed to me. Any edits that occur while I am on that page will not update on my version of the page. They will not show until I refresh or reload the page. 
---
- 0:02 You begin editing your comment.
---
- 0:02.5 You finish editing your comment. 
---
- 0:04 I finish reading the comments and decide to reply to yours. At the time of my reply, your comment is still in its original form, because I have not reloaded the page. 
---
- 0:05 I finish typing and hit send. 
---
Therefore, you edited your comment *after* I saw it but *before* the three minute mark. 
---
And you clearly know the time frame of how long it takes to make an undocumented edit, because when I said 3-5 minutes, you corrected me.  Which I was hoping you would do, because that’s how I confirmed you knew the **exact** time frame. 
---
You had opportunity, motive and means. 
---
Now, there’s the timeline that proves it’s quite possible that you made an undocumented edit after I saw the comment.
---
But please, continue to argue that it’s not possible I saw your comment before you edited it, simply because my comment came five minutes after yours.  That’s not relevant here. All that is relevant is *when did I load up the page*?  And I loaded the page after your comment but before the edit. 
---
Now, have a good day. It’s been amusing watching you use faulty logic to try to cover up your minor communication error.
---
i like the scrapping cards, don’t assume you’re supposed to be quick to max out perks.
---
So you come to reddit thinking you can trust people here. That's interesting
---
Well im probably not the best example because not only do I have an awesome pc, but this game runs almost perfectly for me which I know is far from the norm. Im playing at 3440x1440 on ultra settings with 90-120fps. Although I've heard reports of people with the same specs barely getting above 60 fps at lower resolutions so clearly the optimization is busted.
---
Edit: specs for anyone curious are 2080ti/9900k and 32gb RAM.
---
Sorry to be that person, but what does pts stand for?
---
Yeah they already said that. Plus SS pocketed limb plans are actually in the game in PTS and will come in the game in a later update.
---
&gt;funny how you dont aknowledge your own part in this. that is not at all how this began.
---
You're mental you. You started the insults, own up to it. You'd prob be better doing your homework.
---
You on pc? I can be on in a few and you can use my world.
---
I can’t wait to use some of them. Mainly the ammo one that gives even more. I use to get on teams when I was doing the battle pass but once I completed it I usually just solo it unless at events. Like last night 3 queen launches in a row. I knew some of those 600 800 level players where going to be quick with damage and just to be safe I wanted to be in a team: usually I can easily push the 1k damage. But nice to be safe with teams
---
Spare yourself the headache and just don't.
---
Bloodied builds are going to be fine, is everyone else that's in trouble as they are NERFING EVERYTHING!
---
Wrong answer, you are supposed to piss on his rug.
---
Again I appreciate it.
---
they reset for some people.. and apparently not for others...
---
mine reset on PC...
---
If you really want to waist caps just goto everyone's Vending Machines and buy all their Legendary Items, and then Script them, and Gamble away at The Rusty Pick till your hearts content. lol
---
I just found this out. Wtf Beth.
---
DELETE THIS!!! lol
---
I can't.
---
It really ties the room together.
---
I love it!!!
---
Scrapping cards is fine sure, it cleans up your SPECIAL menu, but I don't want to sit for an hour scrapping hundreds of cards that I've banked to get coins. There should be a simpler system imo.
---
Calm down Satan
---
What are your specs, and how long have you played? I'd ask after your settings, but with you having it removed, it's kinda pointless.
---
Should give them to npc's too
---
I miss the fear of hearing a mini nuke fly at me
---
I heard it are asians with strange character names that don’t translate well to western character digits.
---
It’s a good game. For the most part other players can’t kill you unless you accept PvP or are in a designated PvP zone (workshop)
---
I play PS4, and the pvp is minimal at best. Just turn on pacifist mode and they can’t do anything.
---
It’s better than it was two years ago, and it’s on sale? Deal IMO.
---
And you can play solo, even if you buy 1st (paid sub) for a private world.
---
If you have armor piercing adjustments and don't get the vats bug, you should still be able to 1 shot a max level super mutant.
---
Because that was a reward from rose’s questline. It’s awarded as a weightless chassis. They show up when you deploy.
---
But the thing is, I didn't edit anything. Why would I even care to when when no one's even trying to debate me over it? Have no reason to edit something that I just posted when I'm not getting any interaction from it. I just post and forget. More likely explanation would be you goofed and read it wtong, or had no idea to begin with and are trying to make up for it with this weird 'edit' stuff. 
---
Look, everyone make mistakes. It's okay. I don't blame you. But this fuckary truly is something to be laughed at
---
Last night I was doing radiation rumble event on my xb1s with just me and one other guy. I've done it numerous other times with more people where we just xp farmed the event. For some reason the other guy decides to use a tesla rifle halfway thru and any time I look towards the main entrance into the event I had maybe 5 frames per second. I couldn't even maneuver to loot the meat piles it was lagging so bad. Pulled up my map to fast travel away and the frames were fine for some reason.
---
If you don't understand the reference, you are not old enough to play this game.
---
I’m a junkies and all perks are ok for me. It’s bloodied builds that don’t want perks that effect their low health and rads.
---
Most NW except for the place camp were a hassle sometimes. But they were 250 score only then it was easier to play a higher lvl event and get those 250 score from the repeatable 10k xp.
---
You can play a whole day without seeing any other players, unless you visit their camps or do public events. The amount of players per server is somewhere between 20 and 30.
---
That being said, open PVP isn't actually a thing in adventure mode, the primary mode for this game, so if you don't shoot other players, or join a private team, there isn't much any other player can do to you. Generally speaking, at least on PC, the community is pretty chill and generally speaking will help you out more than try to harm you.
---
Got it over a year ago...was super skeptical of the whole online thing.  Pretty much play everyday alot of fun (for me at least) solo or as a team.  Community is nothing like gta but there are some less desirable among us.  I think is worth a try but it does have its issues.
---
What time does it end? I have tons of cork, but been on vacation this past week so couldn't make any donations.
---
loot isn’t tied to time, it’s based on how many items you’ve picked up, you have to go around to multiple areas before the first place respawns, you can even do it later in the same day if you’ve left an area for a while
---
Exactly so what’s the big deal? Don’t know why people are so angry over this. My build won’t get affected, I run a non legendary full health build that doesn’t indulge in damage buffs because this GAME IS EASY! That stuff isn’t needed so idk why people are tripping over a damage nerf.
---
You gotta have patience for it, I recommend a cheap used copy. Unlike red dead and GTA updates are free and you can play without worry in pacifists mode. Unless you try to take a workshop than that's a pvp zone, but those aren't major game play features. 
---
Also the game runs poor sometimes on any platform. So you gotta take that into consideration as well.
---
People need to get away from this stupid mindset that they want to be way overpowered. It’s not what’s best for the game. 
---
Being stupidly overpowered is a good reason to put down a game, not keep playing.
---
Jokes on you, they’re already late.  They’re still working on the FO76 autochess mode...
---
Nothing like attacking blood eagles and hearing the whistling of a nuke flying at you
---
can we have a power armour buff too the x01 and ultracite need it
---
I have no idea why people on Reddit lie.
---
Do *you* trust everyone on Reddit to tell the truth and have no bizarre ulterior motives?
---
How... naive.
---
And ironic.
---
It’s a great game to play alone, I do, but still have fun interactions with other players. It’s easy to ignore other people, you can even join teams to get benefits but still ignore the other people.
---
PvP is so easy to ignore it’s practically non-existent if you don’t want it, just don’t engage with anyone that’s being a prick.
---
a one time pain to have a bunch of coins is fine
---
Her voice is annoying imo.
---
You want a participation award for simply logging onto the game too while you're at it?
---
\**rolls eyes at the fact that people want everything in-game to be low-level and easy to beat without actually working for it*\*
---
The fact that a user simply pointing out that the bog has BEEN a high level area leads to you spouting "they have the right to explore the map just like everyone else" like this is some kinda "All Levels Matter" classist conspiracy against low-levels is just.....hilarious tbh. Do you even play the game??
---
I'm Fallout 1st, i have 10k of most materials... i had only 900 cork.
---
I'm not going to farm for it, so i gave my 250 for the participation prize of a bottle of cheap wine and worthless floater grenades and moved on.
---
Upvoted for visibility. Careful what you put in vendors right now.
---
Mine did not either, this has happened to so many, they need to just autocomplete this dumb season thing for everyone
---
Are you using perk cards? Because those count as damage buffs!
---
Oh the irony.
---
The elephant in the room: Those ghouls have Fire &amp; Cold resistance on the PTS?!
---
Hi,
---
Would you suggest moving from bloodied to a tse full health build?
---
already ended
---
Mine never reset. I was logged in when they were supposed to reset. That could be the cause.
---
PS4 man.
---
E: 3 weeks but it seemed like enough time for me to make up my mind tbh
---
I'm so pissed man. I'm only doing 3 times the damage instead of 4. Enemies too tanky I can't kill anything. I literally had to use 50 rounds to kill a scorched(missed 49 of them but let's not get too technical). I gave up on farming. I'm using so many bullets I'm bankrupt now
---
it both cuts incoming damage in half and effectively doubles your armor values at the same time.
---
If you have 250 armor, and get hit by a super mutant behemoth that deals 250 damage, without the perk you take 125 damage, with the perk you take 54.
---
Which PS4 and you did play via cable and not wifi, right?
---
It's fun to watch them try to keep up the pretense, though.
---
I was able to complete it with a combat knife, so you should be fine 2nd time around
---
You need to pick up 180 items after picking your first item. If you pick up a typewriter, you’ll need to pick up 180 other world items before that first typewriter will spawn again. That may be your problem if you’re keeping your farming list too small. As for enemies with no loot, I usually have to actually open the meat pile or dead creature and then I can see the loot. That might help you with that issue also.
---
It would be cool. But the first person who hits a ball it would go forward 10 feet, magically come back 5 feet, somehow a canoe will appear and the golf ball will hit it and both go spinning 100 miles an hour and the server would crash. Dross Toss is all the proof in the world needed to know golf will never be possible.
---
It's a lot that you lost, if my gun loses 43.3% then it only does 270 when coming from 477
---
They should do this with the croc bag, I'll never get one lol
---
so don't teleport to a player at the camp then =0
---
That’s probably the most dumb suggestion I heard
---
you're right, i did start the insults. to JIM STERLING. not YOU. and you responded with "I'm not bumming jim sterling", despite that not at all being my implication. you got defensive. then i said that if you GENUINELY did not get £15 worth of fun from the game, that it said more about you to me than the game. i can pay fifteen bucks for a meal and enjoy that. my implication there was that feeling "gutted" at spending fifteen on something and not finding ANYTHING that made it worth the price of admission was skeptical to me. and then you claimed what i said was it was your fault you didnt enjoy it, which was not at all what i said, merely that i feel it takes a lot of effort to find nothing woth 15£ in this game. if you had paid 60, sure, that's a crime. but 15? come on now. it was around this time i thought, "gee, it seems like this guy just wants to argue with somebody. may as well give them what they want!" and thus, i decided to be a dick back to you.
---
oh, and, hah hah, "do my homework", like im a child or something, funny. homestly never understood this insult. you know there are people going back to university and college in their 50's and up that likely have do homework? how is the aknowledgement of someone getting a higher education insulting? like, this isnt even part of the argument, im genuinely wondering why that's considered an insult. who started that?
---
Other than commando and rifleman perk cards, no I can’t think of any other cards that increase damage. I used to use adrenaline but I stopped when it broke and got used to being without it so I allocate those points elsewhere instead. If the weapon perks are getting the nerf too, that sucks I guess I am getting affected but it really doesn’t matter. Game is easy. I’ve been thinking about doing a complete naked build only using survival perks. There’s plenty of options to  kill stuff that doesn’t involve trivializing the game and becoming god. They should really implement some kind of hardcore mode similar to fallout 4.
---
I am making the post because the players shouldn’t be fixing the game buddy, the devs should.
---
Honestly most of the time i trigger it by picking safes always find new tech data in them
---
everything should be made purchasable for in game currency, not instant buy all, but at least have something to work towards if you missed out. I can't stand limited time rewards in games. I cannot ever imagine I will.
---
and the seasons should be completeable without having to grind repteable xp multiple times daily to finish the season reasonably just by playing the game.
---
I know I didn't edit anything. I'm thinking you do as well or you are high on something and saw some sort of a hallucination of my post or something lol. It's really no big deal in the first place and it's really funny how you react to it to preserve your ego. I mean come on man. We both know I didn't edit anything. You are a very weird guy
---
Yeah, kinda lame. I don't know what I was expecting but it almost feels like an aquarium to me because the chickens don't feel like they are actual living creatures. They are more part of the object. I do love the chicken noises though
---
Pro and yeah with cable at first then on WiFi but with no noticeable difference.
---
I'm on Xbox also
---
Something about accessing that terminal at certain angles causes you to get stuck.
---
When using my bluetooth earbuds I've noticed audio issues (cutting out/glitching, game may lag to catch up etc) but only when ALOT of noise is going on at once (mainly SBQ and everyone is using rapid firing guns, though LitS has had it before too)
---
Never had it happen when using my main USB headset, so either it's a Bluetooth issue, or we're experiencing different problems.
---
pls fix the amount of lag we get when a mini nuke blow up before making it viable
---
&gt;Some enemies scale to lvl 100, mainly big guys
---
In PTS now little guys are also lvl 100. For example, in forest they scale to max lvl 25, and in Savage Divide to lvl 100, this means if you lvl 100 player with lvl 45 rifle, the regular super mutant you meat will be level 100.
---
I berserker. Lol. But you share what you want, ill just find a different team. Its not a big deal really, I dont see why people get all worked up over someone sharing a particular card. Just make a different team, don't hate message a guy over it.  People can be real dicks in this game sometimes.
---
&gt;So I tuned into the encrypted broadcast the other day and noticed that it had changed from a series of tones to a type of phoentic alphabet style broadcast, so I decided to have a crack at breaking the code.
---
I'm new to the game, so I haven't heard this signal, but you're describing a [numbers station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_station). 
---
They also used a similar communication format in the show Person of Interest, which was a good show, BTW. Instead of being broadcast via shortwave, a nearby phone would call and give the message.
---
Ah so I was just unlucky then ?
---
We both know you *did*. 
---
Give me a few moments and I’ll upload the screenshot to Imgur.
---
I tried to give you a chance to recant, just remember that. You brought this upon yourself.
---
No my audio doesnt glitch just the whole game lags as my processor usage is taken up by the audio service, i use a aux headset so our problems are most likely unrelated
---
Yeah I get the same shit man, it's gotta be bad optimisation. Fallout 4 had the same problems, heading into Boston sent the frame rate way down.
---
The thing about explosives is they are really ineffective against armored enemies. Unless it is an antiarmor weapon and you get sneak or other buffs. I had a few legendary explosive weapons. The most effective ones were those that had the 50%limb dmg modifier. Probably has to do with the AOE affecting all limbs within the explosion radius. With grenadier 2, it is highly effective on mobs.
---
You're missing the point, they nerfed all damage classes including the casuals lol bloodied relieved a 60% estimated  damage nerf and Junkies a 50% estimated damage nerf. Bloodied will always be king.
---
You can server hop to get it done.  If someone completed the quest on the public server you are on recently it will glitch.  Or a private server.  It may take several times though
---
I just finished a SBQ event. I got a chuckle someone was using a fat man. Was that one of you? Good job!
---
Then you'll be effected as the nerf hit rifleman and commando!
---
the dude abides
---
several server hops I mean
---
no it's not. It's a logical solution to something.
---
thanks for the test!
---
I'm led to believe so, I've had the same problem before so I always try and access that terminal as straight as possible and it seems to work fine.
---
One user said they sent in a ticket and Bethesda awarded the atoms. Not sure if it marks the challenge completed though. Their issue was the SBQ dead not triggering. They sent a screen shot by the queens corpse, while on a team so their name was on screen, and had the loot visible on screen to show they had done enough damage, they screen shot it and sent in a ticket.
---
Weird. I do get lag sometimes but no worse than any other online game.
---
Sure go ahead
---
Honestly that's awesome we'll have a way to buy lunchboxes, especially for people who already got what they want with gold and have no use for it. Nice one by Bethesda if you ask me
---
don‘t you just LOVE the ambient sounds and all around feeling during the event? beth did a great job for once, i don‘t even mind the delay anymore. great, stable event.
---
It's good to hear its possible, my PC is alright but definitely no where near your rig haha. Thanks for your response.
---
Cool thanks for the help
---
Interesting! What stat do you think would be the ideal one to replace with explosive? Gives me something to look for if I ever get a drop naturally.
---
This happens often for me on PS4. Only way to fix I found is to reload the game.
---
Damnit, I have to re-download the app.  Hold on.
---
Chads are the biggest crybabies. I welcome the change. Gg beth
---
Okay, thanks.
---
Sounds like stairs to me.
---
Hope it ain't a app that let you photoshop lol
---
Not only ghouls. Looks like every enemy now have some fire and cold resistance.
---

---
He's referring to the whole bit about cockroaches surviving a nuclear holocaust.
---
Yeah, 160 mil? There no way in hell we turned in that many lol. I think Bethesda may be fudging the numbers a lil bit lol
---
What weapon are you using and how bad is it?
---
pvp is very much NOT the focus of 76. turn on pacifist mode, never claim workshops, and you'll be fine.
---
as for solo play, yes it is good for solo play. i play the game alone 90% of the time and have a blast.
---
You can only have a maximum of 4 vending machines, make sure you don’t have any in stored besides the main 4
---
I can imagine tesla rifle plus all those ghouls, sometimes in situations like that I try to pull the map up and the game locks up for like 15-20 seconds. It's rough.
---
can only have a certain amount of certain objects
---
I know. That's why I mentioned the rad damage.
---
That's been a bugged thing for a while. The last time I requested a drop I never got anything and I didn't for several requests after that, so I just stopped.
---
Thank you everyone for the help
---
You built your camp at a random event location! There’s a few of these in static locations around the map
---
your camp is next to a random event spawn, there is a set pool of what they can be.
---
1. The existing enemies are as you'd expect.  The Lv. 75 and 100 enemies tend to hit a lot harder.  I was getting one-shot (one-bit?) by the Mutant Hounds in the Daily Ops event, for example.  It was apparently enough damage that even Dodgy couldn't do much to stop it.
---
2. Yes, but it's more noticeable on some enemies than others.  A Lv. 75 Ghoul or Super Mutant still goes down in one shot for me (Bloodied Gunslinger, in this case).  A Lv. 100 maybe 3.  But boss creatures and the Lv. 100 Scorchbeast are *extremely* tanky.  They may turn out to be outliers though, who haven't been tuned in any way.  Lv. 50 Laser Turrets also generally require 3-5 shots to kill, which makes any area with them a slog.
---
3. I think the damage feels more "correct" this way.  I have an increasing sense when going back to Live from PTS that Live feels "broken" in comparison.  Enemies are still largely dead before they can react (with the aforementioned exceptions), but it does take easily 2-3x the number of bullets to down them.  This is why I think that as part of this rebalance, they *also* need to look at the ArmCo maker and the general resource cost/quantity ratio of ammo crafting.
---
I do that all the time. Half the time I have to pick them back up again because they don’t understand.
---
No Photoshop needed. And feel free to zoom in *really close* to check the pixels. 
---
[What do you have to say now?](https://imgur.com/gallery/yed5Zfk)
---
I rest my case. You’re dismissed.
---
Thank you for the real info!
---
Yes damage has been reduced but people are blowing it way the fuck out of proportion. 
---
Ill get downvoted but bloodied players are just butthurt they dont one shot everything anymore. Even though they still do a significant damage.
---
Would you happen to have an Anti armor or instigating weapon you could test aswell? Even if theyre not the same as the bloodied/junkie ones. Direct live vs PTS test comparison would be great.
---
You can ignore people
---
I see they still haven’t fixed the “banner” yet...
---
looks fine to me
---
What a price
---
Find yourself a nice long pipe with fast swing speed.
---
Whack job.
---
You keep being you.
---
proof? i've been hearing this for at least 4 updates but there is no video proof on the ps4, and you'd think there would be since the ps4 has a 14 minute video capture of every thing that just happened.
---
Nope. Never. Giant Spiders are such a tired trope in any fantasy or any setting with mutated/space fauna. I'm really glad that Fallout has not fallen into this cliche.
---
DiD yOu eVeN rEaD tHe PoSt? I'm helping XD
---
I’m gonna sound like an ass for saying it but are you saying that I basically grounded my fucking ass off on this shit just for it to become available if you get like a weeks worth of bullion? 
---
😕
---
That's a pretty good move from them. Lunchboxes were highly requested, and getting a use for bullion for people who already got everything they want is a good way of doing that. Killing two birds with one stone there
---
I hope so because adventure mode has been dumpster fire since I’ve started playing when it was out in game pass the only thing that has kept me around is nuclear winter
---
Lol seems you are the one that's getting dismissed
---
Damn. Oh well I guess. Thanks for letting me know
---
Never forget, that the way Beth programs mannequins is just to make an NPC look like a mannequin and make them immobile.
---
Each week or so whenever you get a new thing to donate it upgrades just a little bit but not by much but to your question yes it does get better
---
Can you drop them?
---
I did all of my Daily’s except for the Nuclear Winter one yesterday. The only one that reset today was the Nuclear Winter one. That’s a lot of S.C.O.R.E. down the drain. 
---
I would recommend not being online during the reset.
---
 Interesting, I’ve definitely tried a ton of different locations that used to work and haven’t been able to trigger it since Monday.
---
it gets easier at around 25 I would know I am done with officer on deck at level 27 and I have hundreds of ammo for each of my guns and almost 1000 for my shotgun I just soloed a scorchbeast I was constantly under fire from other enemies like for some reason raiders came and they didn't fight the schorched or the schorchbeast atl all same with some super mutants and some settlers appeared (with surprisingly good weapons like gatling lasers and .50 cal machine guns) but I accidentally hit one with my shotgun and they attacked me and ignored the scorched
---
You got a good deal.
---
It's an interesting weapon.  I modded mine to be a Plasma Flamer which I'll sometimes use against the Queen, but the burn rate of the Plasma Cartridges is pretty insane.
---
Sometimes it's really not worth trying too hard. I just craft maybe one or two of the items that I'm looking for and then a couple of days later I'll try it again.
---
Yes The 4 are stored separately, and not in a blueprint
---
Also it should automatically be put in your inventory
---
F*** them in their cork.
---
Yes all objects are stored separately, not in blueprints which is the only way that would apply.
---
Workbenches I have 6/20 built
---
That's an insane decrease wtf
---
I booted a guy once.  Something like "Panzer1488" and fuck those people.
---
I don’t understand why it’s a big deal for a women wanting to playing with other women. It’s more comfortable. Not a big deal lol
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/423679/new-features-in-the-pts?language%25255B%25255D=en&amp;language%255B%255D=it&amp;language%5B%5D=it
---
It wasn't hard to find.
---
Nope - I just think the game needs a change up. Marching into the sbq 20-30 times a week with the same magic bloodied 50 cal to take down the queen in 5 minutes gets old.
---
They are nerfing my guns
---
WAH I'm a one trick pony WAH! I suck at games and need to one shot since I have no kill WAH!  
---
That is what you people sound like.
---
I have some tag prints on my T-60)0)))0
---
This is *my* courtroom, sir.
---
Done. Apparel and food are now in separate tabs.  Never again will you have to worry about accidentally eating your clothes.
---
I just tipped my toes into PTS with my level 150ish.  The whitespring sentrybots were level 75. Just outside of the WS three ghouls were level 100. Took a quick trip to Morgantown airport which is notoriously easy to run through and the scorched were level 25.
---
I love it. I absolutely love the level scaling. What I haven't tested or checked is if xp is granted the same as in the regular game. So does a level 75 give me a big injection of xp as it did before? I can deal with level 100 ghouls all day. It's xp gold. That would make the legendary board a bit more fun to play as I could focus on more of the map for xp.
---
Yeah....didn’t it end at 10am est today?
---
Then it’s really DOA as this has to be one the least popular BR out there
---
Wait... are they the ones that you poured your blood into?
---
Just don't put on the MIRV and it's fine. With MIRV its 16 nukes and VERY short range to where you almost always take dmg from it lol
---
I don't really care for the Hunting Rifle though.  Never have.  The Lever Action is about as slow as I'm willing to go between shots.
---
And frankly, it has a difficult time on PTS in the Daily Ops, as well as Colossal Problem, where you're getting swarmed by enemies.  You just can't keep up with the onslaught.  Bloodied were definitely hit hard in this rebalance, but the general "powerful single shot" gunner probably gets it the worse, because you really balance your build around the idea that things will drop dead quickly.  You can't get into a battle of attrition with Colonel Gutsy (let alone the new Lv. 75 Colonel Gutsy).  You needed it dead yesterday, and that's why you hit like a truck.
---
I did.
---
A lot of these items look great but it still doesn't excuse the piss poor SCORE system. Why events don't give score I'll never know (50-100 for easier ones, 300-400 for SBQ, ISS etc)
---
I picked this game up because I like the  Fallout universe, and I needed something to pass the covid time until Cyberpunk 2077 and Assassin's Creed.  I was pleasantly surprised how much I really enjoyed it, but I've been in endgame for a while and not feeling the legendary race. Long story short (too late?), your outline of the upcoming changes and my current feels make me happy new games are right around the corner.
---
Loved the game but need a break time.
---
I'm confused... what's changed from Fallout 2 that makes anyone sympathetic to the Enclave? In Fallout 2, the Enclave wanted to wipe out all other humans, because everyone else has been exposed to FEV. They want to clear all the "mutants" so they can retake the continent.
---
The BoS weren't exactly "good guys" either, but since the Enclave's goal was genocide, the BoS start to look like good guys.
---
&gt;  i've been hearing this for at least 4 updates
---
this sub has a sort of cycle of supposed issues that always come back but don't actually come back. There was a long stretch of time where people came here with wild stories of being forced into trade menus and getting robbed by strangers, and that turned out to be a complete hoax. After nearly every update, we get the same old complaints of "legendary spawns were nerfed", "thirst and hunger drain faster", "sneak was nerfed", and everything else like that. I have no clue whether this particular issue is real or not, but based on this sub's history, you would not be in the wrong to take it with a few grains of salt at the least. We have had countless iterations of stories related to being robbed by other players since 2018, and that only turned out to be true twice (once for consoles)
---
Ssssttt don't tell them:p
---
you do know that this forum is a very small portion of the player base yeah?
---
I'm not crying about anything I've just seen people posting stuff about it honestly I could care less I was just curious to get peoples opinions about if people just stopped playing adventure mode whether or not it would be logical on Bethesda's behalf to just rebrand the game to Nuclear Winter lol
---
Lone Wanderer requires two ranks of Charisma.  Travel Agent for life, yo...
---
Happens with all legendary robots so not just the squatch. But agree very annoying having to look for it
---
No I was reading comments and I had a chuckle because someone as I was half reading half shooting the queen. Was using a fat man. It was too funny seeing the nukes fly and hit with a boom. If I had a drink I would have blown it outta my nose. It's as if they were changing it up at the very moment you were posting this on Reddit. You probably got someone reading this post. Too good man too good.
---
I assume you lose the Lone Wanderer perk if you join a public team?
---
Nothing worse than missing out on a legendary enemy, even 3 star legendary enemies barely drop 3 star legendary items so we need to get as many as possible. Give the fans what they want with this much needed QOL change.
---
Ya it's definitely bad optimization. Fallout 4 has mods that help with that and I hear we will be getting mod support for 76 at some point, so hopefully mods will help.
---
I didn't know that...thanks for the heads up :)
---
Then that makes me a total dumbass. Thank you.
---
What else am I gonna do with 27 contaminated nuka quantum's, the watoga vendor won't answer my calls anymore
---
If I am reading this correctly, and please let me know if I am not, you have a current blueprint, in the Blueprint tab, with "Its a very simple structure with a small footprint, 4 vendors 1 workbench and a stash box", also, you have 4 vendors stored separately, in the Stored tab? If this is the case, you can not place the blueprint if it includes the vendors because it thinks you already have 4 built, located in the Stored tab, thus giving you the "Exceeds..." error.
---
This is how I read it.
---
I play adventure exclusively and will remain doing so regardless of losing some damage.
---
if they're stored they are built and part of your budget. 
---
see if you can build your blueprint at a workshop. if you can then it must be something in your stored
---
No no im absolutely against pvp in fallout.
---
I once was about lvl 150 and got kiled by a lvl 40 dude. Juse because...you know...he had a bloody build and i dont so he basicly one shoted me (yes i know one shots are not possible because of the 110dmg limit) but if someone kills you in less than a second i call that one shot
---
Pvp in fallout is poorly balanced and i hate it but thats a story for another thread
---
For me, it seems sus like it's a guy trying too hard to seem like a girl.
---
I’ve done the CHARGE with a flaming chainsaw at the sbq event. Treasure hunter outfit and all attached...looking like I’m taking down a Dino in Jurassic Park. Gotta find innovative ways to have fun as Bethesda is dragging their feet
---
I just switched to the meta like last week. Still hadn’t quite moved my perks around 100% but managed to get the essentials for surviving. So I’m a bit bummed.
---
I really, really hope they take some feedback for these ops. I don't want them to fail as horribly as the vault raids did. Getting some repeatable, difficult content with matching rewards would be really awesome
---
Thank you I appreciate your input :)
---
They are coming out with ammo factory legendary perk that allows you to make 250% ammo. At level 478 you should be able to max it out day one.
---
Public test server. Its where they test certain events and things like that, allowing players to find bugs etc
---
Mine was a 1* B gauss shotgun, 1* for life!
---
Convert them to 27 contaminated 'Nukashine: My Blood's in it'
---
What the fuck are you even talking about?  The only things even close to being "previously sold in the shop" is the white reskin of the raider helmet and if you REALLY want to stretch it the armor/weapon skins.  Otherwise this season was almost entirely new assets.
---
Or, get this, it may actually be a girl.
---
That only happens if you're using a blueprint from the *stored* tab, which there are none. 
---
 When you normally use a blueprint from the blueprint tab, it pulls all objects from your stored objects. The 4 are stored and the blueprint is in blueprints tab, not in stored, so they should be used like any other stored objects
---
Yeah, but I think the difference there is most legendary robots stay in the place they were downed when they explode, but the squatch yeets to who knows where and becomes a horrible game of hide and seek with no clues.
---
Poison resist increased from 150 to 500
---
Are poison weapons going to become viable at some point?
---
I love to hand out Shielded Vault suits to newbies, because those tend to get worn well past the early stages
---
Can't make nukashine yet, but I'll put it on my way too empty fo76 to-do-list
---
Make sure to have the scrapper perk as well!
---
Solution: Nerf damage output
---
If it's on a big sale like 70% or higher then you could get it but otherwise don't. It's not really worth it. Despite it has gotten a lot of big updates it's still very buggy and unstable so save your money on it
---
He just wanted to grill for godsake!
---
I can see where that would be annoying. But atleast your not fully dedicated and have a shit load of time and effort invested into the gear and build like a full set of uny,pow,sent armor and a b2525 weapon.
---
Is it actually everything like all guns all effects? And is it a bad nerf or small
---
A friend of mine told me that the way people steal items from your stash is if they can clear it out.  For this reason I have a bobby pin listed at 30K.
---
True or Myth?
---
Good idea for those utility items, cause having the only way you can get an ammo converter to have played in a 10 week interval is kinda scummy.
---
Oh cool, the first stage of the "adjustments" they promised for explosive energy weapons. It only took them 19 months. Maybe by 2024 they will be seen as fixed enough to be reintroduced into the pool like they said they'd do
---
You're missing the point.  They are swinging from one vine to the next without making sure they are holding on to the next vine.  
---
Why even leave a gap?  That's piss-poor management.  My 'fun-meter' is maxed out with shit.
---
I have a question? Do they take from your vendor only or is it they can take from your stash box through an interaction with your vending machines? I understood the people were getting items without paying the caps for items. Just would like clarification as to where the items were being taken from.
---
How did you grind to lvl 133 in 4 weeks? Thats crazy and dont know how its possible?
---
You can't drop or trade items that have been skinned, pretty sure
---
Yeah but they forgot to update the numbers, we aren't sure about how it went, the number has been static for about 24h
---
Right, they SHOULD be, but (and this may be a recent change, I don't know) if you scrap the stored ones, you will be able to place the blueprint. May have something to do with a hard cap, maybe the vendors have different paint jobs, or any number of issues that the build mechanic has, but because of the hard cap, it may be that. You're gonna have to refill the vendors anyway, scrapped the stored ones and see if it places the BP :)
---
I don't think there is any damage variation that will make mutant weapons viable. Maybe instead make it boost mutations or reduce negative effects by a %
---
I'm not sure how far along you are in the game, but to get the nukashine recipe, you have to start a quest called 'Wasted on Nukashine'. This is activated by clicking on posters found in any train station.
---
Edit: Btw, feel free to add me if you like (ID: Eldyrus3). However, most of the time I am just off soloing and doing my own thing (even when in public groups). So usually tend not to spend alot of time hanging out or RPing or anything. 
---
One thing you could do (if you are interested), is join one of the discord faction groups. You can probably find an active one that enjoys doing group missions. Here is the link to that subreddit:   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout76Factions/new/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout76Factions/new/)
---
I have full unyielding and about a 8 bloodied weapons. Spent a lot of caps. Not mad tho, caps are easy to replace.
---
Now imagine how much the new event will take.
---
That’s true. The XP benefit (if any) would be awesome
---
Lol who cares?! Down votes are as meaningless as people’s insults. But thankfully I’m being up voted elsewhere! Oh wAit that doesn’t matter either.
---
Like anyone on Reddit has ever said, Whoa, I should agree with this guy. He’s got so much karma!
---
Just do it like how scorched earth works, at the end of any event with a guaranteed legendary enemy or enemies, give that many legendary items to each player, right into their inventory.
---
Why would you quit playing when there's bunch of new content right around the corner? They are just bluffing and are thinking it would work on Bethesda
---
We lost our only hydro cooled bonesaw, if its the only one you have take better care of your shit man
---
Seriously?  People are going to complain about bullet sponges either way, it doesn't matter if you double an enemies health or halve a players damage.  I mean hell we ALREADY still somehow occasionally get people complaining enemies are too bullet spongey in the live version of the game.
---
I'm interested as well.
---
I have wanted to do the drill with a miners outfit and the Camden park mister fuzzy mining helmet. Now were you double bar or single? Lol wish I could have seen that!
---
You can just shoot them to 1 hp and gun bash them to death
---
I can do that I think, I'm level 99 and the only quest I've done is the crane's treasure quest xd
---
You are supposed to open it with players or teamates around.it gives you buffs..lol
---
You want gambling?  Go to the Purveyor.
---
Maxing out intelligence, cranberry relish, lunchboxes etc. Used alot of old for xp tactics. Only did it for the repeatable score as I was worried about losing out
---
Again, I seem to be fortunate. People with machines as good as mine sometimes report much worse performance so its pretty hit or miss. Ive definitely seen a lot of bugs and a few graphical hiccups in my roughly 40 hours with the game so far but im having an amazing time.
---
My ign is alphawolf12, will be on tonight if you are looking someone to play with
---
The only thing  I wanted for bullion was the farmable tiles. Now I have those so its an option, I always seem to get treasury notes (think I have around 200 now)
---
I've seen some of the rewards they have planned for season two and some of them aren't bad but if you're a new player some of the rewards are helpful ie Stimpak/Radaway bundles
---
Except that's the problem with people making these complaints, bloodied weapons AREN'T less valuable or useful now.  ALL effects that boost damage got hit by this with bloodied just being the biggest hit and it's STILL the strongest effect around.
---
I see. So your character is 133? If so thats some good going
---
Great! My ign is dhtkroon, lemme know when you're online, I'm just finishing up my legendary run dailies
---
I didn't forget, I just didn't care.
---
RNG being RNG:
---
Redditors: WHY!
---
I've never been in a community that has more whiny, annoying people like you. That's all I'm saying hahahaha
---
You're thinking of the ArmCo ammunition construction appliance which is a gold bullion reward from the raiders after completing Wastelanders. The ammo converter is from rank 5 of the Legendary Run.
---
same thing as the legendary run being impossible because (enter math here). Just ignore them.
---
There’s two ways to take that. You agreeing with me, or that your were telling me the OP was right and that I was wrong to down vote him. 
---
Considering this is Reddit, I apologize for my assumption about you.
---
So I can read. But it can be taken different ways.
---
I guess it’s more of a concern for people that don’t have first
---
I'm actually kind of surprised about how much I don't care for the second season's rewards (the only things I actively want are like... the ship in the bottle and the new planter, maybe the greenhouse stuff) but I'm happy for the people that are pleased with it! Personally, I won't really miss feeling the push to grind for this season, haha.
---
oh god no... unless they change the voice actress, the way she drags the words drives me insane
---
I just pick up all junk mindlessly and always have lead and acid tagged 🤣
---
Two shot also ?
---
Been through 7 levels of RNG hell on 4 characters.. no more!
---
On my 5th character I’ve made the decision to go with what I get.
---
First 3 star legendary was the fancy shotgun so I’m a shotgun build.
---
My current Armour is a mixed bunch of 3 star items.
---
When I start crafting I’ll run with the first 3 star items that drop... embrace the RNG!
---
I've found this community to be one of the least toxic I've played in.
---
I just found an underground camp yesterday and it blew my mind!  So cool. I tried to figure out how to create it with no luck.  Thanks to your explanation, now I can! Thanks!
---
It's part of the charm for me she's very love/hate tbf
---
Holy crap that worked! Quite odd since I didn't have any alternate paint jobs or anything. Must just be a thing with vendors anyway thanks! 
---
Good thing I can craft a vending machine from 3 steel and 5 wood lol.
---
He just wanted a bunless hotdog
---
It was a legendary prefix in FO4 I don’t see why not.
---
I'm my testing, ur tent has to be there BEFORE the event triggers. I've had my tent everywhere from the car to the 2nd hole and its work everytime.
---
Only time it didnt work is if u placed ur tent after it popped up or during the event or tried to move it during the event.
---
Yeah, sitting at 133 currently. Though it does make the level up challenges alot harder
---
I was thinking the guy that made that card got laughed at. 
---
He’s thinking “who’s laughing now?”.
---
don't nerf unyielding. just cap specials at 30. SIMPLES!
---
Yeah, explosive weapons used to always be high tier in prior fallout games. Really surprised how crap they are in FO76. Also might just be me but legendary guns with exploding bullets shouldn't be doing more damage than missiles and mini nukes.
---
Just ~~don’t~~ put on the MIRV and it’s fine.
---
I like the splosions.
---
needs 200 more pounds.
---
Players: “The Season 1 fillers suck!”
---
Bethesda: ~changes filler rewards~
---
Players: “The Season 2 fillers suck!”
---
Y’all I know it’s not perfect, but sheesh...
---
I donated all I could  (250). I didn’t have much in my stash and I don’t have time to farm for it.  The reward was awful anyways...Was some sort of chem and the rest alcohol.  Nothing of value in the provisions.
---
Same here. Honestly when I heard "amd you can launch nukes" I thought this game would be salty and toxic as all hell. Glad to say it's one of the least toxic games I've ever played. A welcome change from GTA and others like it
---
Neither can the brahmin. Not sure why anyone expected more from the chickens. People even complain about them not laying eggs, an item which doesn't even exist in the game.
---
I thought this can only happen with enemies, but with objectives too?
---
Only the folks that love being op are complaining.
---
Ah thank you so much! I was so confused seeing all these posts with pts in them
---
PvP is completely optional. You will obviously see other players in your world, but you don’t have to interact with them at all and can play how you want to.
---

Both of which were in the atomic shop. That's what the fuck I'm even talking about.
---
I'll hop on now for a short min to add ya
---
A vats crit bloodied handmade. Lost around 130 damage.
---
Sad, but I really feel for the marginal builds. It was a pretty easy game with my bloodied commando, so I’m not complaining too much.
---
Lamp GIVES OFF projection, just need to be night, and in enclosed room without other Light sources! Like real deal, but its not that bright tbh..
---
Because you said people were one shotting endgame enemies so I'd like to see that
---
With lunchboxes apparently being purchasable with Bullion it would appear that even if there is a Int. XP nerf there will still be a path toward massive XP boosting, so I think it's less of a issue.
---
Reddit is a bit toxic cause there's someone like me posting stuff. But in-game community is really good especially after that patch where Bethesda literally disabled pvp
---
Woosh
---
Newbie here.  How does one send in a ticket to Bethseda?  I have discovered Beckley twice now with two different characters and it still hasn't unlocked.
---
I really do like it. Running out of there at the end... man I hate wendigos!
---
yes please
---
Lol! Yeah nerf it.
---
Me and two others took Earl just fine yeah he is tanky as hell but doable
---
No no no god fuck no. It took me literally over a thousand hours to get my collection of every junkies weapon in the game. I do not want to have to do that shit again at all.
---
Nah that affects unarmed bloodied too unfairly
---
Awesome! Glad it worked! Has to be something with the hard cap. Good luck with your build :D
---
Wow, who actually downvotes this shit?  Losers...
---
what does the math say your SPECIAL should be?
---
i gave away 15 (so people could get badge) after buying them for 100 caps each. I am sure someone would snap them up if you put them in your vendor
---
Yeah at least that’s option. Thanks.
---
if you are unsure don't buy the game.
---
but this goes with making ANY purchase, if you're not sure you want to spend money on something don't.
---
Most primary legendary effects need to be reworked. There's only a couple good effects, the rest are situational or bad.
---
Ouch. For my little junkie thats gonna hurt.
---
Probably New Vegas... Enclave are a bunch of old dudes in power armor in that one
---
That doesn’t really nerf it. A full set of unyielding still nets you 15 to specials save END. Which is literally like two characters in one.
---
Only worth for the tadpole challenge, outside that never saw anyone using them.
---
My plan is to be a PA Cryolator Tank for my group, would you say that's helpful or would just more raw damage be preferred.
---
I would like more favorites too, please.
---
I stick the diffusers in my vendor at their default value (iirc 20 caps?) and they'll sell occasionally, usually in multiples of three - i wonder why xD.
---
I'd assume the plan itself still has some value, though i rarely do the event so haven't had one to sell in a long time.
---
How many do you need for the badge? 3? Cause if so I just put 3 of them in my vendor
---
I think they are still worth something, none of my characters have it yet (and don’t see people running Arktos anymore) I keep looking at vendors to see if i can get a copy of the plans
---
Great job.
---
Plan definitely is worth a lot. Individual stims not so much
---
Do you use any drugs that might effect strength?  Are you addicted to anything that would lower it?
---
Or maybe people actually like using their favorite guns? You sound like a whiny bitch tbh
---
I’m gonna run my heavy gunner tonight. I use a bloodied explosive LMG. I love it but it’s an ammo hog. I can only imagine how much now!
---
Glad i could help! :)
---
According to u/eckserah it affects Perks, Weapon Mods, Legendary Weapon Effects and benefits from food &amp; drinks...the only thing not affected is explosive damage but if you read their post from earlier you'll get a better understanding on what's happening :)
---
I've had audio sync and lack of audio problems for weeks, but I'm on ps4  I have a hunch it's something serverside.
---
That's good to hear.
---
Stupid idea
---
Where?  How?  When?
---
Taggerdy and Maxson kept in contact. After not hearing back from Taggerdy he might have sent a scout to check out what happened. A whole year has passed since we left the vaults, there are still BoS bodies \*in good condition\* littered everywhere, maybe one of those are scouts, or possibly someone who knew of the BoS fate made it to Lost Hills.
---
Known bug
---
Put them in a display case, stating that you got big balls
---
Hmmm. Haven’t seen it in use on Ol’ Earl. Super useful on the Queen, so it might be viable.
---
Keep using my ultracite gatling laser just like I do for the SBQ since fusion cores are a face roll to get. Gotcha.
---
Thx he got like 5 post and one explains bloodied nerf so I’ll read those thank u tho
---
They really didn't, tbh.  Believe me, as I just had tons of junk stolen.
---
Go to Bethesda.net and find the support page. Select fallout 76 and there should be a sent ticket option at the bottom. You’ll have to find the right option, but there should be a challenge bugged to send in a ticket. Maybe a picture of you in that location on the map screen while on a team.
---
Same :(
---
Need to nerf all vanguard armor as it is not fair to be at full heath and get buffs.
---
The "events" are a wide range of things.
---
This happened to me months ago with the best weapon I’ve ever gotten. I’ve taken my vendors down ever since and haven’t had a problem with it. (On Xbox btw).
---
Yes, actually.
---
In Fallout76Custom.ini, under the [Controls] section:
---
&gt;fIronSightsPitchSpeedRatio=x.x
---
Wherein x.x is the ratio from standard you wish your ADS to be reduced.  I.E. 0.6 would be 60% the sensitivity of your regular mouselook speed.
---
Nukacrypt is pretty nice if you are just dropping a nuke as a means of getting supplies. But, IMO, as a means of finishing the story we should do it as the developers intended to make sure that we get the full story.
---
Unfortunately just a single bar
---
Yeah I wasn’t either when it happened to me
---
If you’re on Xbox I’d gladly buy from you or if you feel generous give them to me for free maybe?
---
I still love that you see speaking out about subpar game content, as whiny and annoying. I’ve had a hand in modding, and game development, and I know that mistakes and oversight happen. It’s virtually unavoidable, and if no one spoke out about it, I would actually be a bit concerned. But in this case, and many other cases with “games as a service”, it has been quite commonplace to ignore glaring issues in said games, even when the community is very vocal about such issues.
---
Something something pessimistic response about Bethesda not knowing what to do when a number isn’t hit something something.
---
I don't know if you know this but in PTS unarmed got heavily nerfed so this would only hurt the melee in general plus the weight buff with strength. I dont think unyielding needs a nerf
---
I got it when it was on sale for like half off and it's been fun, but yeah, would never have payed full price.
---
I agree , but legend run is not fair argument, it WAS impossible, but they give as more time and more score tasks...
---
I hope they bring this to live. I look forward to more of a challenge. I really pray they patch up the magic gun b.s.
---
Ah the whole working together ie. shooting same bulletsponge -mechanic. Seems kinda shallow thing to rely on.
---
Uranium won’t produce max level loot unless they increase the level of the miners. As far as I know there’s no plans to do that and max level is 40
---
yeah 3. if you need caps put them in for a high amount and see if they sell.
---
The FPS was horrid for me on ps4. Hope that isn’t a big deal to you
---
Personally, I'm simply sick and tired of being forced into playing the "good" guy all the time. Even the Raiders in this game, at least those that don't want to kill you on sight, are basically settlers with attitude. 
---
The BoS doesn't tickle my fancy, never have. They are techno fascists who will belittle you at every chance they get and will murder you just because you, a wasteland pleb, has technologically advanced weaponry in your possession. 
---
The Enclave, imo, has a lot of story potential. It's a sinister organization run by a rogue AI with ulterior motives. MODUS most definitely ain't Shodan but it's near enough to get me hooked. :)
---
But muh magick legendarys wryyyyy!
---
People either missed or didn't like the sarcasm /s it seems
---
The nukes got em all. That was what the war was all about.
---
Oh. What a shame.
---
Sorry but I'm on ps4 :/
---
I hope that'n not only because of those new grenades.
---
Okay thanks :D
---
Been posted about 8,237 times.
---
It's a 4th or 5th tier legendary in this game, and from what dataminers have said, it seems like most of those effects aren't even functional so it's unlikely to be coming back as a legendary effect any time soon. I meant the ones we have, which to be fair isn't much...the machete sacrificial mod, poisoned crossbow/bow mods, floater gnasher grenades, maybe something else
---
Can you please explain the "additive" change and what does that mean for junkies damage in conjunction with perks like commando and adrenaline....
---
&gt;it \[just\] works.
---
FIFY
---
Damn
---
Yeah I just do my own thing most of the time. I'll generally do a side quest and if I'm close to having enough whatever for a daily or one of those ones you get to from the map, I'll do them.
---
Scrap them for lots of steal.
---
but it would put a cap on things though. Not sure if the glitch still exists but people could basically get double the effects of unyielding. some guy posted a pic when public teams launched and he had like 40s and 50s all over the place.
---
Faction vendors. Saw a pic seems to be 3 for 100 gold bullion.
---
The planetarium looks amazing if you build a proper room for it, you know, like a real planetarium where they turn off the lights. Most people I've seen just drop it in the middle of a wide open room and then complaining that it sucks. No shit, of course it looks bad like that.
---
Thanks for the work. Can you post the display (pipboy) damage for each if you get a minute?
---
Buff Berserkers!!!!!
---
Try scrapping them for materials, mods, and stop looting everything you see.
---
They’re all bad except bloodied and junkies.
---
Do you happen to have a link to the video? :)
---
Even that wont anchor him, he's such a bloody paper that he'll be blown away when a mole rat breathes on him.
---
With legendary perks being the new grind goal and xp being the grind, int and lunchboxes get really important.
---
If it’s a glitch, fix the glitch. Without the glitch unyielding is still over powered.
---
Literally having the stats of two characters seems way over powered.
---
Im on PC... windows 10 version
---
Like most issues, this sub and YouTube will be full of complaints but the adjustment to game is actually not game breaking at all and objectively kind of necessary. 
---
It's not nerfing a single build, it's recalculating damage overall from all sources. It's a rebalance and should help with people coming in trying to one shot trolls the queen. 
---
This will amount to a lot of crying, maybe Bethesda will adjust a small bit making it closer to 25-30 loss vs 40 and then like most things this will fizzle out in all ways except the occasional twitter comment about how they ruined the IP because their handmade no longer does 2500 damage per shot.
---
Wait, how drunk were you yesterday?
---
As per the standard insanity for this game, for the lamp to work there needs to be free room in your camp budget. (I read this here a while ago but I cannot confirm.)
---
K shouldn’t worry Bethesda will have found 40 million down the back of the couch. To go with the 159 million they found in a cupboard and added to the total donated and rounded it up to the nearest million.
---
I have a combat one and if they fixed the rubber banding I would use mine more but it seems that I heal the enemies more than myself.
---
AWESOME
---
They are everywhere, especially the Assault Rifles which are a Super Mutant favourite. But they are so heavy and if there's no bench nearby I usually leave them.
---
All damage is nerfed meaning the game just got a hell of a lot more grindy. I mean if spending all your time looking for lead is fun fill your boots
---
0 to Karen instantly- reddit gold
---
Yeah that’s what I’m saying, fuck damage nerfs; please don’t screw the intelligence stacking!
---
In PTS?
---
The only issue I see with this is new players can't ride the coat tails of high levels anymore. I'm sure most won't care but it was nice helping someone new blast through some levels by getting tags on some 68 and getting 300 xp. Now the 68 will be lower for them
---
They respond to this fairly frequently. Just a few days ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i852nr/comment/g17qzh7
---
So it’s being worked on.
---
That is a crappy solution. Try this: if "killed" a legendary goes into a "incapacitated" mode like in NW and stays like that till the end of the event, or two minutes whichever comes first, allowing all players to tag it. This will rob the joy from all those one shotters of course, they may even quit and go find a game where they can express their shitty antisocial essence.
---
I know you can not drop atom shop skins... I was just reminding folks there is a skin for machetes.
---
This is a great question which I can’t believe I didn’t ask myself. With armor bonuses, perks, and base points, I should be sitting at 29 points. In reality I’m at 27. I do have -4 from both eagle eyes and bird bones, though. I can go into further detail on what Strength points come from where if wanted/needed. 
---
After checking my armor again, I just realized I had on an unyielding chest piece when looking at my carry weight while writing. I don’t normally run with that CP and only put it on today. So my carry weight is really down to 375, not 380. Will add this to the initial post.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iae6ve/damage_test_live_vs_pts/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Damage is less but people are blowing it way out of proportion
---
Do you know how this affects sneak bonuses?
---
Yeah, I’ve been trying to get that plan for like a year, so...
---
I don't know, physically I think that she is extremely hot. But her voice is just really annoying. So, I am conflicted.
---
Ah, I see then. Weird. It should be an intense fight, but for good rewards. Sounds like it does need some adjustment. Over all though, its a step in the right direction
---
Thought about that too but don't know...The whole cork numbers seemed fake to me
---
Beyond bird bones and eagle eyes, I do not have anything that lowers Strength. I don’t have any addictions. I feel like the negative effects from both those mutations are suddenly active, but who knows.
---
The East Coast BoS does not exist during the time of F76...
---
They are probably just making sure that whatever number they choose is divisible by 250, unlike when they fudged the cement number.
---
If you mean have two-sided wallpaperable walls? Yes. This is a very very very VERY known issue and it’s being fixed soon. There have been posts made in this very subreddit remarking that you’ll be able to double-stack walls again, maybe even by Tuesday. Do a search for that sort of topic and you’ll find it.
---
Edit: here ya go. Found it for you. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ia985a/to_all_camp_builders_there_is_a_hope_double_walls/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Ok. Feels like you are making a huge deal out of nothing to me. It’s going to be a non issue in a few days. 
---
Anyway complain away...
---
Seems you'll have to invest some of your hard earned shekels on atoms
---
I mean, I'm at 7k damage on mine...
---
Stop crying. I just tried it out with my junkies: it's not that bad - it's just fine. Maybe for bloodied it will suck but maybe that Meta is played out anyway and we can start enjoying the SBQ fights again without 30 second kills by the fuckwits who choose bloodied.
---
Why I can never move my camp location ever again, I love the constant stream of enemy encounters, legendaries and score targets. 
---
It's a random assault at my camp too so usually their busy fighting each other and  it my camp.
---
Usually only becomes a problem if a visitor triggers a spawn and didn't realize there was action up the hill going on. Since It usually only spawns when I log in or fast travel I know to check for mobs before going about my business.
---
Really? Because PUBG defo had way more toxic loading times, just an example. I just think everyone should be loaded in the map at the same time more then anything else. Could always pick up a book or a fidget spinner damn 😂
---
PLEASE
---
Buy power armor mod plans at Whitespring and then you can sell more of them since the vendors get some caps back.
---
Man I have been wanting that plan on my medic for so long.
---
Lmao we'll see hopefully in a short time
---
I’ve always wanted a keyring in the misc tab so I don’t have to scroll through all my keys when storing my ores and gunpowder
---
*All free items* Lol do better devs.
---
What kind of price for plan? I am on PS4.
---
No, even if you'd play daily and are not hit with the autocompletion bug, you wont make it w/o spending money for atoms and buying ranks.
---
All my weapons and armour are screwed from the amount of times I’ve tried to get this stupid quest to progress in super peed off
---
Their counters usually don't get updated on the weekends.  I'm sure we will pull through at the last minute like we always do so it's all good!
---
I may have just found part of the problem. I thought -4 for both mutations was a little steep considering I use Class Freak. I took the card off and back on again and it reset the effects to -1 Strength for both. My carry weight/strength are still decreased, but the visual for -4 is gone.
---
I gave up on most NW challenges, for 250 points, it's not even worth the time to disable mods, wait in lobby, load in game to go do it, re-enable mods.
---
Place my camp 3 times? Sure i can do that in a couple of minutes, take a photo? don't even need to leave the lobby. Anything else, nah.
---
You know all the PTS nerfs that everyone's scared about?
---
My Fatman hits harder on PTS.
---
Bloodied HW/Explo/PA build-
---
Twoshot Fatman- 6248 Live, 7118 PTS
---
Twoshot MIRV Fatman- 2010 Live, 2286 PTS
---
(And for comparison:)
---
Bloodied Missile Launcher- 1949 Live, 1568 PTS
---
Then we'll have these antisocial freeloaders joining the event at the end, tag everything then fast travel away.
---
Good question. Curious about this myself since I love using them.
---
Yes, especially with the Gauss Shotgun with the right legendary effects.
---
You’ll have some issues with flying enemies, so a good backup is a Heavy Gun, since that is also based in Strength perks.
---
Raider collecting chems and booze all the way. Chems are very light and sell for good money to robot vendors. Some of them like berry mentats are also really useful. The booze might seem useless, but 90% of the time it will have what you need to complete Biv's daily, and the recipes he gives you sell for a lot in vendors.
---
Not what I was expecting but it's the opposite for me I don't like robots but man that voice
---
The annoying part is the waiting time between matches
---
**SPOILER FOR PTS:** It was also noted on the PTS that you will be able to buy the chicken coop and ammo converter for gold. So, if the chicken coop is the item that you really want to grind for and you are not really into the rest of the cosmetics, you might want to consider skipping the grind.
---
Only real option is to go grab your credit card.
---
At least it'll please the overlords at Zenimax.
---
I like my jangles backpack but I think it is a tad bulky.  The chicken coop is cool but I wish it gave me something other than fertilizer.  And the wallpaper is cool.  and so it the firefly jar.  Other than that...only the lunchboxes were worth the trouble.
---
Id be happy if they just raise it up to an even 1k. That extra 200 lbs would go a long way. If they up the cap on daily scrip too that be extra cheese
---
there’s also been a weird glitch with unyielding where sometimes a piece gives the benefit twice
---
So much potential ammo lost. I’m so sorry for your loss, but as our lord Todd has said “it just works” ,  so hopefully you will eventually gain it back
---
But...were on plastic now (scrap laser rifles from mutants with scrapper for a solid 10 plastic)
---
This is a fair way to make missed content available to the peeps who missed the event. They still need to earn it but its not unreasonable and not lost opportunity because they couldnt do the season. 
---
I actually like this.  That said. Im rank 100 and done so im not their market... but i got buds who just couldnt do the run amd they are happy about this possibility
---
So is junkies
---
Bad idea
---
I don’t believe that increases the amount of cork, but it’s still useful for the other materials.
---
yea looks good.people would still complain on every balance change. Too much dmg too low dmg ...too easy boss too hard boss... people just like to complain a lot these days
---
Ah thank you
---
Mobile likes to really edit my words to other things. Sorry for the terrible grammar an format.
---
Your are correct.it is just a mod for combat armor.i feel violated.son of b!+@h.
---
i hope so. I've been using one for the last 700 hours
---
I managed to get a quad explosive double barrel and it's so fun to use
---
Yep. if its all the same person, you could slap a big square over the place where the name appears and above. Purchases scroll, name is always blocked, maybe 10 minutes on a shitty PC with free software (most of that spent downloading and watching a youtube tutorial). If they can't be bothered after five days (the last time they posted this, after which it got removed), they'll have to forgive my doubt. Or don't, whatever, it's not like it's not a puppet account anyhow.
---
dude just press the share button, you can take a screenshot or save the last 15 min as a videoclip 
---
I always save videos like this and edit them with share factory
---
The pvp in FO76 is nothing like GTA. You can opt out of it completely by using pacifist mode.
---
Pretty much no
---
Probs to you for going to help him out too. I was on a public team and I stumbled across the Colossus and signaled for everyone to come follow me a few times and no one came so I had to fight him myself. Even when I had the ‘fear’ icon showing up which is entirely unique to the Colossus fight none of them rushed over.
---
True true. But I haven't taken advantage of much of that or the double xp or double score stuff. I didn't realize they extended the time tho. Issue is as a game that considers itself an morpg, there is not much variation of comparatively effective builds. This is fine for now but as they work there way towards raid and dungeon type content, things need to change for it to play well and not just everyone running around with almost 0 health doing all the damage and the rest of us feel like a waste unless we go for that 1 meta. I'm a full health no PA shotgunner stims build and I'm very happy with it, as I've never been a fan of glass cannon builds myself I'll stick with this.
---
The pts is spawning them at level 100.
---
Look up lazy shotgun build on YouTube
---
Honestly in my opinion the survival aspect of the game is just annoying it doesn’t actually add anything sure wearing gas masks to stop diseases is cool but having to eat and drink every two minutes is just annoying and tiresome
---
Two-shot is still trash (TSE might be okay; rumor is the Explosive effect still triggers off total damage, which it SHOULD, so TS might get a little extra from that double E). On a fully optimized Bloodied HW build, a TS 50cal was only showing 9% more damage than a nonlegendary 50cal in my pip-boy. Which is the result of the new scaling mechanics- it's probably 25% more than base damage, but I've also got Adrenal Reaction, and Nerd Rage, and 9star HW, and Bloody Mess.... the end result isn't very impressive.
---
AA is a lot harder to test because it's not about buffing your direct damage, but more about removing enemy armor. That being said...
---
I run a Bloodied HW/Explosive build in PA (with stabilized). Fully maximized damage (no limited time buffs)
---
Vs a Glowing Wendingo in the Colossus cave, my Primed AAE 50cal was doing about 10% less damage than my Primed BE 50cal. So it's a very viable alternate weapon if you can't get your hands on a bloodied one (remember, this is still on a full bloodied build; a full health AA build will still do significantly less)
---
I'm exploring it now. Truly hope the emote is something they can be awarded.
---
My IE combat absolutely shreds. Full health is also super fun
---
Yes if you get a magic one or magic +15 blocking armour.
---
In vats they 1 shot almost everything
---
Really?  So they’re increasing the levels of the mobs as well?  Are we getting level 200 scorchbeasts?
---
This challenge is super easy. Only need 1
---
I switch them around. I like the Raider one for the dialogue but you can change it's collection output as you see fit. Sometimes I do Chems/Alcohol, sometimes scrap, sometimes ammo.
---
I feel your pain had it happen to me today. While searching with my camera some level 300+ thought I wanted to take his photo and started posing.
---
I just started getting into it more. Though I can’t believe I lost my Nuka Tapper saves. Ugh.
---
Whatever happened to the no longer having to tag legendary at events? Didn't they say this like a while ago?
---
It’s getting fixed on Tuesday I believe
---
I am new I came like a week ago and I'm level 27 and have  finished officer on deck. some high level player gave me over 1500 10mm ammo
---
I have a cqb build.i maxed the shotgun perks.it seems to be working better but not as it should.
---
Much better!
---
yeah
---
One Appalachia?
---
That’s not going to happen lol. People aren’t going to quit over this
---
I rate them 10/10, wish we had the arcade cabinets from FO4.
---
Um... no? I'm thinking most people will stick to low health builds cause it's still OP in PTS
---
Actually to expand on that One shooters can effect my game, Freeloaders do not. Easy choice.
---
Do you use class freak, did you forget to put it back on?
---
Sort by weight ores go to the top with cards and gunpowder
---
Just use melons. They fill hunger and thirst.
---
How do you figure? How is being addicted to alcohol or anything else a buff?
---
Can be if you can get your frame rate to 60fps or more on a consistent basis. Angry turtle showed this I his most recent video on magic weapons.
---
Yep, it's why if i can't do the task within a few of mins (which includes all the waiting around for a match etc) I just no longer bother.
---
Kill creatures? Nope
---
Kill players? hahaha, nope
---
Survive 15 minutes?, nope.
---
Run into the fire for 1 min?, sure.
---
Place a camp 3 times in as many seconds?, yep.
---
Take a photo?, hell yeah, don't even have to "play" the fucking gamemode xD
---
Not sure, I haven't done a whole on there yet, but its from the One Wasteland update
---
ive actually made a casino that people gamble their caps at my camp using a phone app! aloott of players absolutely loved it, i might do a video about it soon
---
Thank goodness. I need to build my UFO 🛸
---
For sure. I’ve seen that with my guy but it has always boosted my carry weight to 420 or so. Maybe I had been benefitting from it for awhile and not realize it.
---
the score system IS a paywall... timegated, tight and literally impossible to beat when semi actively online. also it's intended to trigger the psychological fact that human beings don't like unfinished projects - it will make alot of people buy the last tiers just to have it done at the last few days when they see it's impossible anymore to catch up.
---
I was worried about being griefed by nuking my CAMP, but people in game are generally super nice!  It's a culture I genuinely enjoy participating in.
---
They let you waste some of the most valuable resources you have. Time
---
Full invis, or blurry invis like chameleon?
---
Regardless of whatever we need a full respec option.
---
This is ranged. Melee got hit harder because strength is additive instead of multiplicative now. Example, my knife build does 1/3 its original damage which wasn’t the best to begin with. The bloodied knife is the only one which somewhat works but since enemies have also been buffed it works less efficiently than a nocturnal knife during day on the live servers
---
The PTS nerf is just a rescaling of damage output. They’ve changed multipliers to additives for legendary weapons.
---
Good point. I always forget that you can sort
---
Wouldn't Anti-Armor just function the same as on live, assuming enemy armor values don't change? 
---
As it currently stands, the Anti-Armor legendary on live is essentially a 1.28x damage multiplier on post-mitigation damage, getting you closer to your raw paper damage you see on your pip boy. 
---
There's an old CaptainNoob video that demonstrates this quite well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIWryyf5NZM&amp;t=106s at the 3:50 mark.
---
It's the blurry vision
---
Yeah I get that but the maximum level that miners spawned in at was 40. For them to increase that to 33 levels higher than the highest level mutants and ghouls then surley those are getting increased to level 140 plus and scorchbeasts to 200. And that event will be incredibly popular if it drops guaranteed max level x3 legendarys.
---
Yes! It made me dread hearing that voice
---
Vendor/display items returning to your stash is caused by adding items to or removing items from your stash in a server where your CAMP wasn't able to be placed. I would suggest avoiding any interaction with your stash in those servers.
---
Making everything grindier isnt the same as making things harder. I have a berserker. It’s a challenge. But it isn’t more grind it’s just you have to be more careful and good. It’s a balanced trade off. This change isn’t that. More ammo but shots, more sponges. Boring af.
---
Yah I did it at lvl 45 with the stealth suit with being detected
---
Grognak is actually really fun and I wasted a lot of time playing that one
---
I’m just waiting for the win a match one lol
---
That' s the point.
---
My camp could be placed and was there for a good two or so hours before it happened. It happened at the same time the daily reset happened
---
It's 100 per lunchbox.
---
I do run with Class Freak. I was explaining to the other user that after taking it off and putting it back on again, it reduced the negative effects of bird bones/eagle eyes to -1, instead of the -4 it had listed. I just relogged to see if it was a visual bug and it actually fixed the issue entirely. I’m back up to 395 carry weight. Thank you for your help :)
---
 One of my characters is a level 210 shotgunner I mostly use my anti armor/10% damage while aiming/ reload speed  combat shotgun. And few other anti armor shotguns as well. It work pretty well if you aim for heads you pretty much 1 to 2 shot super mutants and normally around 3 shots if you miss the head.
---
I’m still trying to track down all of them! Red Menace is a favorite
---
Junk. A little bit of everything is always nice
---
You balance shit. If you want to one shot make people real glass canons. Make people make meaningful trade offs while not making the game unplayable for less dedicated players.
---
Ridiculous. 70-80% damage nerf to unarmed melee
---
Yes, 
---
yes, 
---
you can’t tell me what to do
---
I was playing around with Fed76’s price estimator earlier, and I found that, overall, pricing seems considerably inflated.  I play on PC, and there is no way I’d pay 1k for a single star AA lever gun, for example.  The maximum estimate of 4K actually made me LOL.  Granted, I’m aware that it’s just my opinion and perspective as a long time, high level player, but I can’t imagine any of my friends paying or asking those prices either.
---
I’m curious as to where the data is coming from?  Are they actual final sale prices from trading forums and vending, or data collection from browsing 100’s of player machines?  I see ridiculous prices at vendors every day, but that doesn’t mean they’ll ever complete a sale.
---
I’m sure you’re a smart guy, and I applaud your efforts.  I just hope that as Fed76 gains more and more traction as an essential tool for players, it doesn’t also create an inflated market and unrealistic expectations for aspiring wasteland entrepreneurs.
---
When its activated it makes the noises. If its off it doesnt do the pyrotechnic stuff. Just want a mute button for myself.
---
Some people would argue one-shorting enemies is also 
---
&gt;Boring af
---
I agree. So many problems are entirely fabricated. Then you have the people who instigate PvP with sub par builds, then run on here batching about bring grieved for their junk. This game is rife with "victims".
---
I just relogged and it fixed the issue entirely. Thank you for your help :) I guess public teams / Strange in Numbers might fiddle with Class Freak every now and then, so swapping it out and back in (then relogging) seems to do the trick.
---
Played several hours today on the pts and completed quest's all over the map yes I fought lots of level 100 even a level 100 rad roach but nothing out in the wild was to overpowering.  I tried multiple weapons tse combat rifle tse LMG medics explosive LMG tse combat shotgun tse laser rifle aa e plasma gatlin ffr LMG and a couple more and nothing really felt different.  But I'm all for level 100 gear!!!!
---
Damn how long do we have before this drops? Gonna grind to lvl300
---
Ohh i had a two-shot fatman in Fallout 4. So fun to kill behemoth and mirelurk queens with that. 
---
I got one too yesterday in FO76!! But i scripped it right away because mini nukes are heavy af.
---
Any half decent game would offer a free respec after large balance changes (even if the usual respec is gated in some way), it's just a good will gesture to the community.
---
I doubt FO76 will offer it because, well, fuck us, but I do agree it should be an option.
---
I added you rabbit :)
---
youll have to farm daily ops to make tons of ammos and spend them in colossal problem
---
You can only get explosive on the second Stat. So Quad Explosive double barrel would be what you are looking for.
---
Yep pretty ridiculous if you ask me but i hope they come up with higher level weapons like 50+ and up if they implement this and a new high level zone that way everyone can be happy the higher levels get to still do one shot damage while the low levels dont complain about the high levels one shotting everything it's a win win scenario
---
Would be cool. A workaround I found was to hide the switch somewhere inaccessible then control it with a locked terminal.
---
10+ weapons/armor...large amounts of ammo and plans. Bulk plastic, steel, lead and acid sell like hotcakes. As do stable flux.
---
Then don’t do it
---
Wtf are pipboy games?
---
Yes you can burn through ammo quicker but this the kicker: my one bullet does not equal your ten. And while you are burning through ammo faster you're also killing the enemies faster. Without bloodied im stuck there shooting supermutant in the head for ages. And that is what bloodied accidentally fixes, all the weapons with low dps that were pretty much obsolete are playable with it. Hopefully this doesnt completely fuck it up but im not holding my breath.       Ps. Sorry for the wall. Had to went.
---
You missed the point.
---
You wanted the fatman buffed.
---
On PTS, everything else got nerfed... fatman got buffed.
---
Yes. As a revolver fan I agree completely. One wasteland is probably going to ruin the game for me.
---
If a vendor is holding many weapons and armors, I always pay a visit. But if those weapons turn out to be baits like 50 lvl 1 pipe pistols or something you gonna get your camp nuked. I'm serious
---
Oh puhlease, same goes for bolstering... You want to nerf that one too?
---
That's so strange.  Glad you could figure it out.
---
The point is to make certain builds unable to play certain content? 
---
Man, I'm so glad you make games for a living, yours must be so enjoyable!
---
As for addictions: alcohol (ballistic broc/ high hefe) , mentats (berry mentats), overdrive, psycho (psychotats), and med-x.
---
U must also be careful of the order u take....broc, overdrive then psychotats....if other order, they overwrite each other
---
I don’t know! I can’t get a solid answer on how bad the nerf is to intelligence. Every one is all riled up about the damage nerf.
---
I'm not sure because then everyone will need to grind all over again. Weapons, armor..
---
Lead and acid are pretty good. Lead for bullets, acid for ores which can in turn be used for bullets.
---
I dont think I've ever seen a camp get nuked other than on youtube
---
Also RatMonkeys Easy Sorting and Tagging.
---
Lead is my go to
---
Level 100 scorchbeasts are incredibly tanky, they're not even worth fighting.
---
Steel, lead, plastic people always buy in bulk.
---
As for encouraging traffic. As a level 350+ player what determines if I travel to a players camp. 1000+ ammo and 100+ plans. If i see either of these I usually travel there because most players selling this much usually have a good price (1 cap each ammo or 10 caps for plans)
---
I always wonder what platform you guys are on.  Because I find on PC, 70-80% of the time people are really courteous about it.  Not enough to warrant a change, that's for sure
---
Pretty much.  If it wants to work it will work awesome.  If it doesn't want to work then it might get you killed but whatever.  Had a minigun like this and scripped it eventually.
---
Pretty sure you need to complete tadpole before possum. And as I recall all the tests are at the same place.
---
Sorry I'm not more definitive or specific, just wanted to chime in quick with what I knew as I saw your question.
---
Lead and acid always seem to be popular.
---
Personally, I stay away from any deposit, simply because it means 99% of the time I can join a server and I don't get the "Your CAMP cannot be placed" message. The minor loss in any resource is so worth being able to jump in almost any server and still having your CAMP available.
---
Aside from unlimited stash budget, these were advertised features of Fallout First. I just think they should give people what they advertised.
---
Well I'm guessing that's bethesda plan to keep more players playing longer because right now all im doing is sitting around killing and getting more legendaries in my already full stash box. Still doing Legendary run but honestly taking my time rank 93 btw
---
Really. I get rid of a level 90 in seconds. If they increased the level of mobs and the tankyness of them as well as needing damage output this games going to get very difficult for anyone with a sub meta build at level 100
---
Yes please. I have a two shot fatman that needs some lovin'.
---
I was dreading this day. I need to see the numbers on the other effects like AA, two shot and instigating
---
Just explosive weapons in general. I can tell cause no one wants my armor piercing auto grenade launcher. 
---
The reason I'm selling it in the first place is because it looks good on paper but I took that piece of shite into a silo and the thing couldn't even take down a Mr. Gutsy in a satisfying manner. 
---
And don't get me started on using grenades but the enemies get what I call "Todd armor" where no matter how much damage I deal at once it just wont count. It was like I never hit them but they still get alerted to where I am only for me to hit them with my axe and have Todd armor strike again and I take way more damage than necessary because it was just decided that "no, you didn't land that power attack headshot."
---
Gauss Shotgun could be nice but it's so bugged it's nearly unbearable.
---
And ammo is heavy... 😢
---
Oh my mistake.
---
Nah you didn't explain anything you just said how it felt, but didn't explain why :P
---
Oof. That sounds bad.
---
Also gotta figure ninja isnt as beneficial as beforr either, or so i hear.
---
How much does it hit for?
---
it is not and it is a issue. I have a lot of lunch boxes from run and next run has another boxes. Without int stack we loose a lot of xp per hour. Dont play 24/7 and must using max boosting as possible to get tons of xp per hour. This run i complety destroy xp for double xp weekend and do like 150leves per two days and dont need to play every day grinding run.
---
They listened!
---
Looked for one for quite a while and couldn't find it.
---
Haha touché.
---
I prefer junk because it gives everything. I can sell stuff to players for real cheap if I dont need it.
---
As much as i would say lead you wouldn't get enough out of it as a heavy gunner.
---
Yes, I learned this the hard way when I went to deposit my hard earned cork. Bugger
---
"12,000 ATOMs, coming to a store near you!" - Bethesda, probably.
---
/s aside, I'd like this too, especially now with CAMP allies who appear to not know how to shut the damn door.
---
True. I got to rank 94 today. My dailies didn't reset.. I only have the level up challenge and the NW challenge. But also I think they know if they make the new max level let's say level 60, they will lose a lot of players. A lot of hardcore, couple hours a day players. Because all their gear will be obsolete or way weaker, and they don't wanna grind for all those weapons and armor pieces again
---
clownshoe
---
Remember the ability to produce lightweight mini nukes are coming! That’s why I kept mine 👀
---
It depends what do you mean with "viable". 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
In general if you like close (ish) combat it is, if you want range run away.
---
Challenging combat is one thing, boring bullet sponge is another. 
---
These games would really benefit from multi stage boss battles akin to doom
---
Some are butthurt but my unarmed melee is unusable now :(,it hurts
---
Wouldn’t be surprised if it was fast travel related because *cough cough hint hint* healing factor bug Beth seems adamant about fixing
---
Do you have possum challenges listed under your world tab? You wont get possum badges from those quests until you complete the tadpole quest. Only 3 tadpole challenges are required to make the possum ones show up.
---
Also it's really rare to get a possum badge as a reward.
---
You can't just throw together a good build in this game, a cheap and effortless bloodied or junkies build will still be complete shit. To make a true overpowered build requires a lot of effort. The way you talk it makes it sound like people do it because it's the easy route or something. It's not.
---
You can do just fine with a lot of effort put into a build that's not bloodied or junkies, but it doesn't take as much effort as tracking down all the gear needed for a "meta" build, because it's a lot easier to buy the weapons and armor because they're not so expensive or hard to find.
---
Guess what though, with this update as is is in the PTS there won't be gods anymore (outside of the bugged magic weapons), there will be people who do OK  (using meta builds which will still be bloodied and junkies) and people who suffer through a frustrating mess of super spongy enemies and grinding for ammo worse than they do now.
---
If anything this as it is now will force more people into meta builds.
---
 I played a while in the PTS today with a couple of builds and weapons and posted my impressions so far in another post, if you're interested just search my post history.
---
When you are on the alcohol or drugs, not only negates the bad, but BUFFS ur character
---
Or how about allow us to use gold to upgrade, sorry but we have enough currencies especially with the upcoming perk coins too.
---
Now now let’s not get ahead of ourselves hear ok
---
I wouldn't say it's toxic to think that you shouldn't be able to explore everything from the get-go. It is a much nicer experience to need to work towards exploring more dangerous areas of the map, in this game there is are specific areas on the map designed to be for a certain level range, that is a fact, not some toxic idea. And it does improve the feeling of reward you get from actually exploring them, it's not like there isn't enough to explore in the forest until you can move to the toxic valley, the same goes for the other zones. 
---
Having the progression and exploration structured is better than being able to freely move around in a wasteland which is set up to be dangerous but isn't, being guided towards exploring an area to an extent before moving on is a good thing too, you will actually experience the area that way and get to know it's dangers instead of hopping between different landscapes constantly and having the dangers that come with them be meaningless.
---
Care tk eleberate? Like damage numbers and setupnin a direct comparison? I dont have pts so would love to hear.
---
Nothing makes me roll my eyes more than people whining and being passive aggressive about getting downvotes. Stop, bitching about downvotes detracts from your post and makes people downvote you just because you're whining. You have a 90% upvote rate, stop complaining.
---
And post proof or else this entire post is worthless. People cry wolf about this all the time, every single update.
---
Hmm, I am missing a couple Tadpole things. Like scorchbeast cranberry grinder and launching a nuke. I've killed a handful of scorchbeasts but the meat doesn't like to drop for me. I get brains, lungs and wings. Just no stupid meat.
---
What about the two ladies that point towards wayward. Is the weapon they give also level 5?
---
Complete the tadpole ones then possum will unlock.
---
I just did 5 possum badges this afternoon, they aren’t difficult if you are prepared before hand.
---
Basically run a loop of the map then server hop and run it the reverse direction .. don’t try and do each badge individually group them together do them by area.
---
I’ll probably have the high capacity to go with the Armour plated mod with a few more hours play .
---
It's been 24 hours since the PTS opened, this is the kind of thing they fix: report it on the forums or through a support ticket.
---
Wow, that looks awful. Hopefully they will do more adjusting before rolling this out.
---
I take a baseball bat to all of them, 1 hit each lol

i buy any and all junk as long as it's not really overpriced. 
---
try being in your camp. once you get a person there anyone browsing the map will see 2 people in a camp and be all 'what's going on over there!' and they'll come to investigate. And then someone else browsing the map will see 3 people in a camp and be all 'What am i missing out on here?' 
---
next thing you know it's party time. 
---
last night i saw 3 people in a camp so i went over and found some good shit in the vendors. Next thing i know there was about 9-10 people in the camp. Lunchboxes started going off. I then retired back to my camp and about a minute later several people turned up and started buying stuff. I had to cheese it once it died down as i was about to hit max caps.
---
Why are you complaining about this here? Go to PTS forums like you are supposed to and make a report. That is why you go to PTS. To test stuff to see if they work.
---
You can also just skip that whole part. After you finish the reactor repair section there are a bunch of stacked boxes when you first enter the next corridor. You can see through to the next area. drop ur pa frame through those boxes into that area, enter third person and then get into ur pa (might need to play around with it a bit). Saves you a good ten mins
---
What are you on about? I'm talking about the myriad of shit I encountered, what explanation do I owe you?
---
Maybe an explanation would be that some intern at Bethesda knocked this game out between wanks.
---
I'm going to test this later in PTS.
---
with scrapper perk card you can have 14 steel from each assault riffle which is quite a lot
---
You mean to say they are implementing changes/content in a bubble and they are not trying to make the game more fun for teams esp through things like daily ops that offer more challenging combat and more unique mechanics?
---
You understand one shotting everything is bad game design right? Change is necessary. They need damage at a level that allows them to design challenging game mechanics.
---
Does anyone think designing group content mechanics around one shotting creatures with bloody is reasonable? How do you even go about doing that?
---
Same for me but saw a video from a YouTube using the same weapon as me it looks as if the dmg has is 2/10 the original amount 2005 dmg to 330
---
So I've thought about that option too, not having a deposit.   
---
But the looter/minmaxer in me thinks if I don't have one of them, then I'm not getting the most out of my time while playing.
---
I am a big fan of scrapping
---
Thanks I actually posted that while doing some tile work and ruined a batch of thinset that I forgot I mixed so I'm glad someone found it useful, lol.
---
I'm going to play more before I give feedback over there, I did most of my combat today in the bog and mire (only about 15 minutes in the forest), so I want to get into the other areas more to see how that is.
---
I like helping the community, so Im not worrying about not being able to do it when I can just server hop
---
I'm probably a monster here, but I just buy my acid O\_O
---
Seems to be the general
---
All guns an weapons degrade super fast. You need to use Gunsmith or Fix it to repair to 200%. Also explosive effect doubles the decay.
---
This has been an issue since the legendary run started. As far as I know there is no 100% fix to it short of Bethesda getting their shit together. Sorry for your loss brother.
---
Good idea. I am all for nerfing everything that needs to be nerfed to make the game harder.
---
You end up grinding a lot of events that give you plans and legendaries that people will buy from you for thousands of caps. You also grind legendaries from the purveyor that will occasionally give you items people will buy for thousands of caps.
---
You also pick up aid items that you can sell to the vendors in the game every day for 1,400 caps (like purified water), and daily quests and events will also give you cap rewards.
---
I’m constantly maxing out my 30k caps limit.
---
Thats the one!!! Thanks heaps!
---
What's a good way to farm lead if not for the resource deposit?
---
Thank you and please HMU with results!
---
 It depends what your doing if you want to make bullets I’d go to a acid or lead area that’s what I usually do
---
I feel ya, sis. I'm on PC and looking for a girl group myself. The only females I found play with boyfriends/husbands, not many solo females out there.
---
I'm lvl +400 so I'm considered a guy, until I use my mic... then the mansplaining shitshow begings, is so frustrating.
---
Maybe if they gave a type of upgrade level system that would work and keep the vets happy
---
Welp better get grinding I'm 60 lvl away.
---
Powered doors and two pressure plates. Not ideal but it keeps the doors closed while allowing people to come and go as they please.
---
Yep.. a lot of fun .. if you don’t mind the blood splatter ! 
---
I run shotguns with an LMG as backup.
---
Be prepared to hunt down a lot of scorched and mole miners for ammo though ..and find a plastic farming run
---
People hate getting nerfed. Are you new to online games?
---
&gt; Just no stupid meat.
---
I had to kill over 20 scorchbeasts WITH rank 3 butcher's bounty to get 3 meats.
---
yeah, 5600. I've looked around and seen it's a very common issue after Wastelanders for AMD users. Shame that I just built this new PC. Should have probably shelled out the extra $200-300 for the rtx 2070 super
---
Except its not good when entire playstyles (melee) get nerfed hard.
---
So you will take 3- 4 swipes at a very rapid speed to kill something ? Doesnt the combat knife swing crazy fast? Doesnt 2k damage from a knife seem crazy to you?
---
How has 2handed faired any idea?
---
Are you using Gunsmith perk? lever rifle is my main gun and I barelly repair it like once every week or less.
---
Like if you already have a level 50 weapon they can give a npc or item to upgrade that weapon in my head that sounds like something they would make into atoms or gold bullion (hopefully gold bullion)
---
Better than unarmed but not well about 75% lost
---
On Live
---
B Gatling Gun - 138 (100% HP)  |  429 (20% HP)
---
J LMG - 101 (100% HP)   |  175 (20% HP)
---
On PTS
---
B Gatling Gun - 133 (100% HP)  |  294 (20% HP)
---
J LMG - 86 (100% HP)   |  129 (20% HP)
---
Rejuvinated is two perk points well spent. Hp AND AP regen...so much corn soup....
---
With all due respect, maybe it's not your perks but you approach to combat or you don't micromanage your health efficiently. 
---
I might die once or twice in a week, assuming I'm playing everyday single day. There are also instances where I go above 20% health for the extra buffer.
---
Even if bloodied players don't play that smart, you directly tank something like 6-10 hits. Plenty of time to hit stim, chems or run &amp; regroup. With the right combo you can be tanky af. 
---
There's a video on YouTube that shows a bloodied character soloing encryptid &amp; tanking all the damage without it barely making a scratch.
---
Bloodied builds aren't that weak. I don't expect the change to make that much of an impact. Bloodied will probably still need further nerfs.
---
Possum badges are rewarded about 10% of the time.
---
Can’t believe the search function here is still bugged
---
... and then you see dmg nerf on PTS and bloodied weapons will be junk in next patches...
---
I've been messing around in PTS today and felt the bloodied nerf. My main is bloodied melee but has a secondary VE 50 to act sort of as an auto stimpak. I found the VE devastated a level 75 supermutant more than it did in the regular game. Without having done a scientific damage test yet it would seem weapons that don't revolve around a build type like vampire are getting a bit of a buff? I'll run some numbers later.
---
Need three tadpole badges to unlock possum
---
I always forget about the terminal.
---
Added you in game, my ign is dhtkroon
---
"No, not 2 bullets of a perfect bloodied build you liar, crap dies in 1 shot to no build gimp just walking around."
---
 Bullshit. Try using a level 50 revolver with all 9 damage perks and see how few things you can one shot.  If you get swarmed,  good luck.
---
No idea. I haven't tested with sneak...
---
The TTW mod for NV actually does this for the CW super mutants.
---
You can only imagine my dread when I saw a Super Mutant Master rounding around the corner with a **Grenade Machinegun**. Never have I been so glad to be able to shoot weapons out of hands.
---
Its not insane. At most its a 34% decrease, and it goes as low as a 5% decrease. Most things will still be able to be one shot anyways, and if they aren't, well that makes the game more fun.
---
Ingram Mansion, Bolton greens, and there is one in the barn/dome where the crazy cat lady lives just about bolton greens but this one is camped a lot. Also one under the house across from the red rocket in Morgan town, again busy area.
---
Lucky hole mine and events in the ash heap for ores.
---
For straight up lead scraps I guess hitting every gym in the game abd scrapping lead weights. And also collecting every can you come across.
---
That’s the alcohol, not the addiction. The addiction is what triggers junkies. The addictions are actually a debuff unless you keep taking the chems. If junkies was the same you would see people running around with addictions all the time whether they used a weapon or not.
---
The one and only use i ever get out of my two shot fatman is tagging all the adds the SBQ spawns
---
I noticed this as well, pretty lame .. but hey whatever makes their day.
---
Yeah exactly. That's what they would have to do. Upgrade modules for 50 scripts or gold bullion.
---
“Been posted about 8,237 times.l
---
Today!
---
I remember the anger over the TSE nerf. Which, by the way, was completely the correct decision. I was 1 or 2 shotting level 68 mutants with my shotgun. That wasn't even shooting them, I was shooting the floor near them.
---
Every body always points out how most high level players use bloodied and even all the devs on the recent livestream. That tells us there's no balance. It needs changing. Then everybody says to buff *everything else*. What, doing thousands of damage every shot with every build? I'm not in favour of that.
---
Basically, I've been using bloodied lately and I'm still ok with this.
---
I just sent a ticket to Beth for the kill huge monsters challenge. I had killed everything but the queen wouldn't trigger. Took a pic of the dead queen and her full inventory (meaning I did enough dmg) and a pic of the challenge showing only her left. They gave me 80 atoms but the challenge is not marked complete. So if they ever fix it, I've got free atoms
---
Two times in different conditions (invisible bloodied eagles; resilient supermutants) it took 22 min. I've done optimizations both times so go figure.
---
And now also on discord :)
---
Both sets of exams are on terminals in each of the two camps.
---
These tests against the same enemies or current vs higher scaled ? 
---
Thisnis a reoccuring thing and it keeps coming up. The nerf isnt as big as people are saying because theyre are fighting tougher enemies which makes it look even worse. Yes you will be fighting those enemies in the future, but the double wammy is definitely  throwing things off.
---
Day 1(started with Game Pass) someone dropped a Marine treated suit for me. I've worn it for 60 levels. I have since modded it more, but still use it.
---
Thanks. I'll do this. Is there anything heavy I have to carry out? With my stealth suit on im usually near max.
---
I see. Lets remove all legendary effects and give everybody a pipe pistol.
---
And while we are at it, encourage beth to not fix anything but to make everything harder.
---
You don't see something wrong with such a view?
---
Sure but there's absolutely nothing preventing you from equipping those exact same damage perks without legendary SPECIAL.  The only benefit of legendary perks in this scenario is they provide more flexibility by allowing more total perks.
---
So yeah my point stands, there's only 1 legendary perk that in itself adds damage.
---
Anything heavy to carry out?
---
I’ve played all of them a little, but nothing significant.  The one I put the most time into was Wastelad, messing around for about an hour.  They’re fun, but I’d rather be shooting and looting in the actual game.
---
I’d probably play them on my phone if they were made into apps.
---
Yeah but if Bethesda goes through with this no one will be happy and hopefully they realise their mistake and claim it’s a glitch
---
There are 5 (I think) in and around Morgantown train yard. The 3 responder caches are the easiest ones.
---
I am hearing mixed things, but most feel they are good. The biggest complaint is that some of the mutations will full out counter some builds/play styles. For example, one makes it so you can only get the killing blow on the critters with melee attacks. Another apparently has all the mobs stealthed until they attack. Things like that.
---
But they are repeatable, soloable, and groupable. Any success means you have a chance at a rare reward, with better performance giving you better odds. All in all, it sounds like a very good direction to go in for Fallout 76.
---
Until you get stuck in the loop of not joining a server as you can't place your camp, so you try another server and it dumps you right back in the same server xD
---
If the extractors could hold more then a few mats i'd agree it would be worth, but when I can farm the same amount of lead in a few minutes that can be extracted in multiple hours, it's just easier to ignore them and the use the time save of getting in a server the first time every time.
---
It’s fine for metas but my berserker is going to be piss weak now and melee has been monstered.
---
I’m not saying there shouldn’t be some reduction, not not across the board. Why not actually rebalance? Give pistols some love. Make full health builds a bit more viable?
---
Already made a PTS post, don't worry.
---
Im not sure if its gonna be fixed on Tuesday but you can either server hop to complete it or complete it on a private server. It may take a few (or more) server hops but it can be done.
---
Or it's very, very low on their priority list and they just never have time to get to it.
---
Yeah, it definitely sounds like a network issue. I routinely run silos without major lag or server issues and I’m hardwired. The only time I see “server not responding” is if there server itself is having issues (in which case Beth tends to clear the lobby and reset the server) or its during a queen fight when half the lobby is there and laying into the queen with too many weapons that cause a drain on the server I.e. mini nukes, grenades, strangler heart aoe etc.
---
It's been reported!
---
As an avid auto grenade launcher/nuka grenade user, I heartily agree.
---
Use the 200% repair perk.  I have two Explosive Levers - both last a good while before breaking (Neither are my primary weapon)
---
I didn't try going to them yet.
---
Let me know how it goes if you do.
---
Ash heap.
---
It actually should have been implemented a few weeks back when they added fire damage as it's own unique damage type but yet didn't add any DR to fire for players or NPCs which is part of why the flamer floaters have been hitting so hard if you don't have fireproof on.
---
At the overseers camp? The plan on the workbench i have is for a metal bed. Which i don't need on account of my sweet racecar bed ha
---
Could I have bought the raider bot without having the scavenger bot first?  I didn’t realize the raider had so many options for types if materials to scavenge
---
The right Buzz Blade can be incredible. I was running an anti-armor buzz blade back before the Whitesprings nerf, and it was my go to ghoul shredder. Press M1 and W, and go to town.
---
Ah, I think I've fully completed 2 of them. Close to completing a couple more. Most of the things I've read lack that important piece of information. Unless I've been blind.
---
Depends how much it is £10-£15 pounds I would say defo buy it, but if ur not sold dont buy it for anymore
---
At least the auto grenade launcher is glitched in a fun way, the only viable explosive!
---
Having a private world already offers several of these benefits. It makes a big difference whether you can farm items on an untouched world vs one that's already been picked over. Server hopping not required.
---
There are more enemies to kill, more frequent legendary enemies, and so on.
---
Still, I'm not sure what a player who reached level 500 in one year vs 2 years wins, other than time.
---
I've seen some people say they've gotten a good amount, but that's prolly just rng luck.
---
You didn't give any actual examples on why you felt like roleplay was ruined, special was pointless, game felt empty, etc etc
---
I was curious why you felt that way cuz I thought all of those things was a step up from fallout 4
---
Fallout 76 actually performs better on my PC than fallout 4, which has really annoying crashes so that's another thing I was confused to hear
---
One of the lead creative directors of Wastelanders was also a dev for fallout 2, so I've found a lot of the content to have passion behind it, including callbacks like the floaters which are all new enemies with new animations in the current engine 
---
Your opinion just surprised me cuz it wasn't my experience at all and I was hoping you had more details instead of just angry generalizations, but alrighty
---
I love my TS MIRV fatman. Makes camp visits extra spicy
---
Ok I just not re read it and saw you want industrial. Yeah that’s not the one at her camp. My bad. If I have it I will give it to you
---
I'm always down to do something. Drop some nukes? IGN MrMugwump. Discord Magicduck#8978
---
Same here. It'll be nice to have a little difficulty back in the game. In past fallout games, even when I was crazy, endgame OP things like deathclaws were something to be feared. I'd see a deathclaw in the distance and have to decide if it was worth trying or if I'd be better off going around the long way. The only thing that comes close to that in 76 is the assaultron and those aren't even a real threat if you see it first.
---
I'm the one that's demanded damage nerf. If you have problem with people killing the queen within a minute, then why are we arguing? You should be all for damage nerf
---
Yep. It is nice to take a break once in awhile...even though the rest of your team is dying by charred ghoul swarms
---
Hahaha on this playthrough I heard that one sooooo many times. I finally went and finished just so it would stop.
---
You’ve never scoured the gullies in the Bog, trying to find that 3star Gutsy at the end of AWOL, after someone else decides to celebrate by blowing up every car in sight?
---
Nice. Can we also put slanted walls back beneath a roof even if no wall support it? Cause this Is really what upseted me here
---
The rusty pick bar in North ash heap
---
Never dropped a nuke before, gotta try everything eh :)
---
So, you are the one nuking my CAMPS :(
---
What if 50 level 1 players stopped by and wanted to buy some guns?
---
It was bound to happen at one point and everybody knowed that they will nerf the bloodied.
---
But at least it's a step into the right direction regarding broken builds skewing the overall difficulty curve. They still suck at balancing...
---
Take advantage of the game as is and start saving up those level-ups now. I've got 83 spare levels waiting for me, and that was after I respecced for the season.
---
It's a good card, the fault lies with Bethesda, I'm pretty sure they know about it and acknowledged it when I was researching the issue myself.
---
Bullet sponge enemies slow everything down. You will spend more time repairing gear and farming bullets. More time managing inventory weight. Boring and frustrating if you don't have hours to blow.
---
That's without a doubt your problem then. When you complete a 3rd challenge and the actual tadpole quest the possum challenges will unlock. You'll also be able to craft a large, 60 pound backpack.
---
The rusty pick in the ash heap. The map icon should be a little mole miners face.
---
Someone make this man mayor of watoga....what an actual real world solution for people born in a barn!
---
I think One Wasteland may solve this problem. Not with people, but probably with NPCs.
---
My ign is dhtkroon, discord is Dante_-#1162
---
Thank you Bethesda for making lunchboxes available to purchase in game rather than the atom store :)
---
Put on scrapper perk and sell the steel for one cap in your vendor
---
&gt;Ill get downvoted but bloodied players are just butthurt they dont one shot everything anymore. Even though they still do a significant damage.
---
This 100% &amp; I'm a bloodied main. 
---
The current nerf scales down all damage, not just for bloodied. Bloodied builds may still need a further nerf or other builds buffed as the core fundamentals of the bloodied build hasn't been impacted.
---
It's in the PTS already. God knows if it will effect legacies and hacked weapons. My method would work against ALL eventualities. I am sure some sick fucks do it on purpose for the schadenfreude - this way the cannot.
---
I prefer buffing enemies than changing the rules every 6 months.  Kinda sucks forcing people to change build.. Grind for months on end to get your gear and setup just to have the rules changed?
---
take off your clown makeup before typing please
---
Playing it off a 1$ gamepass sub and I still feel ripped off sometimes
---
&gt; But after level 50 you actually became weaker every level because your enemies continue progressing while your gear doesn't.
---
If you are using the same gear at level 100 that you were using at level 50, you aren't playing the same game as the rest of us.
---
Yes, at level 50 in principle you can use every weapon in the game. But in practice it is going to take you a *long* time to acquire your optimal gear setup. The progression isn't in the "level" of the weapon or armor, it's in getting access to the plans and then rolling enough times to get a good combination of legendary effects. For instance, unlocking all the secret service armor plans takes weeks (months?), and then more time to acquire the plans for the mods you want. Then there are 18 prefix effects, so if you are targeting a particular effect (e.g. unyielding) the probability of getting it is just over 5% each time - meaning players potentially have to make tens, if not hundreds, of armor pieces before they are likely to have acquired the one they want. Then if the player wants a particular set of second and third effects they have to do even more random draws.
---
I think the number of players who would tell you they have no more progress to make with their gear would be close to, if not exactly, zero.
---
Its possible, especially since it hasn't been mentioned in any patch notes.
---
Someone got away with a stack of plans from me yesterday. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
If they could optimize the lighting, specifically street lamps and spotlights, that would go a long way for overall performance.  For me, certain areas of Harper’s Ferry and Watoga probably drop into the 20-25fps for me.  It’s always next to a street light.  The Sons of Dane hall absolutely tanks my frame rate.
---
With most games, it’s usually water that gets my GPU cranking.  With 76, it seems to be lights.
---
I found an anti armor explosive pump shotty who I love.
---
Melee still does much more damage but the shotty is too fun.
---
Following.
---
Seems like everything got hit, at least a little.
---
Very happy with my Quad weapons now....no issue there.
---
Ok, it is a Bloodied, 50% melee DMG reflected while blocking, 90% RW Grognak Axe.
---
Correct, but is also why its on the PTS so people can provide feed back. Maybe they could give 10% rather than 5% damage per str to help off set the loss. Gotta let them know for it to change though
---
You could put a ticket in for a refund maybe.
---
You wouldn't like Metro lol
---
They mentioned that as part of future updates they plan on removing the requirement of eating/drinking and just make you gain a bonus from it. Might be part of One Wasteland's original plans, but it's been a while so I don't trust my memory entirely, but I do know that they mentioned doing so.
---
you are a beggar tho....
---
That’s good to hear. Hopefully they fix the new dmg system a bit more so we can get a better idea how it’ll play out
---
Mostly just explosive-only weapons. 
---
Missile, grenade, fatman weapons are all pathetic
---
To clarify: gauss weapons do a component of explosives.
---
“This thing is taking forever to heat up....”
---
I honestly believe they should only buff enemies and other builds rather than making one of the two good ones bad
---
Yeah fuck those of us who put hours upon hours into refining our build and trading for gear. Ugh.
---
1. The higher level enemies definitely hit harder, but outside of the Daily Ops, they’re still dumb as rocks. It’s not going to be a huge issue. 
---
2. Enemies are definitely spongier, but it kind of feels more...right. It needs work, but not being able to one-shot everything but bosses is ok with me. The issue here is if they’ll consistently increase ammo spawns, ammo crafting, buff weapon condition etc. If they boost those things in line with the new baseline it won’t be a big deal in the long run. Honestly, it feels like killing things in the older Fallout games now. Except those things are dumber. 
---
3. In the long run I think this will be beneficial. It’s not currently, currently it’s a shit show, but it seems to be a first step in a larger balance pass. At least that’s what I hope. 
---
The next step has to be to rip off the band-aid and deal with the Legacy, “Magic”, and hacked weapons. Those weapons still do massive amounts of unintended damage. They simply cannot release this into the wild as a huge nerf to every legitimate weapon in the game and no real difference to the bugged and duped stuff. It’s impossible to balance a game when that kind of stuff is in play, especially in light of all this. 
---
After that, they need to buff up underperforming weapons—pistols, energy rifles/pistols, shotguns (non-magic), and at least some semi-auto rifles. 
---
Once the weapon classes are better aligned, then it’s time to take another pass at legendaries. See what’s good and bad after all the other stuff and make changes. Meta builds like bloodied (which I currently run) will still likely be the most powerful, but not so astronomically more powerful that it’s the only sensible choice—give us reasons to consider other things.
---
Lol ah man!
---
Yes most of us play solo, I play only GTA and Fallout 76 now, so yes
---
People are naysaying it but it is possible.. If you hardcore grind for it. The XP score has no timegate.
---
Go search vendors around Appalachia, many have items for low coins
---
I miss my TS mirv and fasnacht. Carpet bombing everything was fun. I'm sure I upset some people.
---
Those terrible Floater Grenades?
---
I'm not going to grind another build.. the hell with that.. 
---
Buff enemies fine, nerfing and changing the rules? again ? nope.
---
Stop jumping right into public events. Wait for people to show up.
---
Buff nade launchers, buff grenades, buff mines, buff launchers, buff cryolators, buff flamers, 
---
ALSO:
---
Buff pipe weapons
---
Buff bows
---
Buff Pistols or allow dual wielding
---
Buff One handed melee or allow dual wielding
---
 \- melee needs a rework in general - more mods, or a secondary attack, or perhaps some type of applicable temp elemental buff - such as acidic goo, fire, or cryo, etc. 
---
This sounds whiny but this game has so many cool weapons I want to take advantage of and see in the field!
---
Well, somebody on my team does it for me, preferably on legendaries.
---
She left a note for you in Berkeley springs telling you.
---
Also how long has it been since you played!? Lol
---
Hopefully not as much a warlord
---
Buff enemies for sure, but bloodied did need to be reigned in some what. Theres a reason is used to heavily. Id rather see it become a more riskh build by nerfing serendipity and droping unyileding to +10 rather than drop its damage.
---
I can try to elaborate why unarmed is hit more than even other melee damage types but I don't have access to the test server currently.
---
I play an unarmed build on the current released build of the game and as you only have one perk card to boost the damage you rely on things like mutations, special stats and most importantly aid items to increase your damage. I will give you some numbers from a base non-upgraded gauntlet (50 base-damage).
---
||Additive|Multiplicative|
---
|:-|:-|:-|
---
|Perk + 15 str|97.5|124.7|
---
|Perk + 15 str + buffs\*1|152.5|346.6|
---
|Perk + 15 str + buffs*1 + junkies*2|177.5|519.9|
---
|Perk + 15 str + buffs*1 + adrenal reaction + bloodied*3 + full unyielding|265|1956.4|
---
As you can see here, if it is truly additive now you will barely be able to do significant damage with unarmed weapons
---
\*1: I used Glowing meat steak, mutant chops, mutton chops and yao guai ribs as well as whiskey, boosting them with carnivore and party boy/girl respectively as that's what I have readily available normally
---
\*2: I didn't account for strength loss from addictions assuming those would either be avoided or mitigated by using the respective item
---
\*3: I based this off of being at 19% health and did not add nerd rage
---
**EDIT:** Removing **"I will probably be downloading the test server now just to confirm but that will take a bit of time"** because I didn't know you needed to be specifically invited (I didn't have much interest in the PTS until now, where there is something I'd actually need to take a closer look at) so I am sorry I cannot confirm this but I can say that the multiplicative damage numbers check out with the live game and that I did the additive calculations in a truly additive fashion, if you want more insight feel free to ask questions
---
I've wanted irradiated spiders for years. We have giant spiders in Elder Scrolls. I'm surprised they have avoided them this long unless its because they already have them in ES.
---
Y'all will bitch and whine whenever the new meta comes around, though.
---
ok, i’m sorry i’ll delete the post
---
Name check out. Seems legit.
---
This is free states country! I will rant from the porch of my bunker thread all I want. Damn commies trying to make things equal among builds on the pts. Damn BOS fudging the numbers so they can build their facist telescope. Damn raiders duping and injecting for fun and profit. I don’t need your kumbaya responder mentality.
---
Nerfing damage works on all situation as well tho
---
yeah, i would agree but i think its the best short term solution to a fundamental problem with the way this game handles item storage.
---
thanks for the advice
---
Look if I wanted my own comeback I would wipe it off your chin.
---
Bloodied ia still the strongest build, the margin is just smaller. It still deals double the damage as junkies.
---
Thats stupid, because of your help Now takes alot longer.... Let People think for themselves!
---
I didn’t know anything was ever wrong with it?
---
Is yours two shot and/or explosive?
---
Get the speed demon mutation and you’ll love how fast you can reload.
---
Quad double barrel shotguns are very popular.  Aside from explosive, +10 aim damage is one of the best secondary effects you can get for a shotgun.
---
Congrats!
---
Enjoy the infested armor?
---
I think they should make it so perks like barbarian and dodgy are not affected by unyielding and sepredity just decreases damage if your lucky
---
Holster the weapon and then draw it again. It’s a current bug and annoying, but you can thankfully work around it.
---
All damage buffs got hit on some level. The higher the multiplicative damage, the harder it was hit. This affected Bloodied and Junkies the most. 
---
Anti-armor might come out much better than it was, by comparison, as it isn’t a damage buff at all. Ignoring 50% of what are now higher level enemies’ armor could prove to be very valuable, especially with so many weapons doing lower damage and not blowing past the armor curve anymore.
---
?
---
This is the point of the PTS... to test
---
Just wait till you play grognak
---
What the heck is this PTS thing people keep talking about
---
Wastlad is my favourite! I think I'm missing a couple but I know I have Grognak, Zeta invaders and Nuka tapper for sure
---
taking life giver off then putting it back on seemed to make it "work" again
---
It’s not about legendary effects. It’s about how bonus damage in general works.
---
Sweet thank you all for your input for those who thought this post was at all a complaint that's fine everyone is entitled to their own opinion but honesty I could care less about Bethesda nerfing the damage on any weapon...all I was wondering was if Bethesda rebranding 76 to Nuclear Winter would be a good idea if people stopped playing adventure mode but again thank you for your input :)
---
Yeah legit everyone’s damage got nerfed to hell, but I don’t think some things are working as intended because in the collosal problem event my legacy explosive Gatling plastma was doing the same damage as my blooded fixer while sneaking with all commando perks on and I didn’t have any heavy perks on
---
I am not involved but safe campers carry on.
---
Ok? And what do you hope to achieve here?
---
Yep, this has been around for awhile. I get this quite often.
---
Did they nerf stuff today. And I'm dumb, what's PTS? Only started seeing this in the past few days.
---
My IGN is jackdread96 if you're looking for another person to play with
---
True, but, the debuffs are easily negated thru items that are easily found thruout the game...I'm a junkie and the debuff dont truly negatively impact me overall...maybe cause I run herd mentality, class freak and stranger in numbers, but either way...still worth it for the 50% more damage
---
If I want to see large and terrifying spiders the size of a van, I'd go to Australia.
---
The holotape games you often find in a RobCo Fun magazine. You can play the games through your Pip-Boy or other terminals. 
---
Most are based on classic games like Robotron or Missile Command, for example.
---
Are the mutations to add aswell? Twisted muscle and talons? I havent meased with unarmed aondunno which effect it
---
I think the movement art depends on your Build and weapon set.
---
I’m a melee build with a ghoul slayers switchblade - it’s the only weapon I have that can one hit a high level ghoul - nothing less comes remotely close.
---
  IMHO, I do more good protecting the worker closest to the platform (and the one on the platform) than trying to run point to point.
---
   The team I run with on weekends has a good balance for RR - one with a super Tesla, (kill them as they come up from the tunnels),  melee with radsponge (roaming killer And rad reducer), heavy gunner with high RR (ore gatherer), and a melee ghoulslayer.  Gives each one of us a more or less specific role.
---
No it IS an insane decrease in damage and no extra bullets for a kill does not make the game more fun when there's STILL big bugs in combat such as rubber banding health, bullets not hitting, multipliers not working and also guns being useless without legendary effects.
---
If you have 5 addictions I don’t know many people going around popping chems all day. 
---
Point is mutations are not the same thing as addictions.
---
How do you get to that?
---
Oh I found a video of it
---
Is that how it works, it saves the last 15 mins of vid? Literally had no idea, but that's cool to know. I was more concerned about jumping off to save my stuff as is, but good to know for future use.
---
If they sold a Craftable Sulfur Fountain on the Atom Shop if would crash the game from everyone trying to buy it
---
Sometimes..yeah.
---
At Uranium Fever tho, even when someone is doing the right thing and waves people over to the legendary, 80% of the time the first dude/dudette  to show up one shots it....
---
Maybe we don’t join the Brotherhood. Maybe they just hire us to run missions.
---
I've stuck through some crazy shit in this game. This and the legendary run are breaking me. I've finished and I can't believe how broken the final camp rewards are. The planetarium is fucking rad--but works about one out of ten times I load my camp. I'm sure I'm not the only one, but I imagine I'm one of maybe a dozen, so this won't effect a lot of people--but I'm pissed.
---
I was a pistol build for most of the game. Found it miserable and finally switched to unarmed. Took me *forever* to respec as I'm over 200 now. I started working on it before the season, then used double XP and a lot of grinding, finished *days* ago. Full unarmed, finally feel powerful and love stealth as a melee user. PTS hits, gunslingers get Tank Killer, (is this a joke? It's a step in the right direction but that won't be enough), and damage nerfed across the board.
---
Pistols were such a shit experience, gauss missing in VATS, breaking stealth and doing about a third the damage everyone else did--now I'm supposed to be happy it's more challenging and everything has now scaled up to me? FML.
---
I'd be happy to pay caps to respec, anything except grinding at this point.
---
Someone please tell me pets aren't an absolute afterthought again. If they stay level 20, holy shit, I'm so done.
---
buff any rockets, make it worth carrying around all those missiles, 40mm grenades and nukes
---
Add all the sources of Damage together and apply as a single multiplier?
---
Edit. Bloody auto-correct.
---
Well this sure as hell sucks for me. My bloody Flamer has been such a wonderful weapon even without the bloody damage adding much. Feels like its likely to become mostly useless again.
---
The poison resistance seems a bot odd with no weapons providing much poison damage.
---
Private Teat Server. PC players only.
---
If wishes were fishes ..I'm just interested in changing things up. I would not prefer this particular change, but we get what we get.👍
---
The one at the end of AWOL always stays for me never had it go.
---
Private test server. These are the reports coming in from folks who have played on it. One wasteland is going to change the game in a little while.
---
Do you like have stock in Beth or something? Is your identity wrapped up in a video game publishing company and you feel anything remotely negative about them is a personal attack on you? Kick rocks dude, I have zero reason to lie about losing stuff.
---
Well, someone thinks they can fix the whole of internet culture.  Isn't that just precious?
---
;)
---
True but what about Fractured Steel do you think? It feels like we have no other option but to join them
---
Is this on pc, I click the dots but see no way to send any messages, even with friends.
---
These were just items from my actual vending machine it seems, was like 4-5 different magazines before I logged off.
---
Yes??.??.??
---
Great job! Hell, i wish i was good with ciphers! Even if its been solved, like all the others said, good on you for diving into it and experiencing it first hand!
---
That bug is why I stopped using mine.
---
I head from a friend that the devs have acknowledged the feedback and are looking into it - not sure tho ... but that makes it sound like it wasn’t intentional
---
I always give aluminum spiked rocket baseball bats. New players love it.
---
So the Strangler and Thorn armor are now even more useless for poison damage. Energy weapons are getting another nerf because of the fire and cold defense buff.
---
It typically flies about ten feet in the air and plops back down, but if it gets killed on the staircase or grass, it can fly a hundred feet away.  I try to loot robots before they explode, but I’ve lost a few since BETA.
---
As much as you like an old reliable weapon, eventually the damage output will be overshadowed by a new weapon. I would say keep it and look for a replacement, but there is no real rush. Once you hit 50 you will be getting weapons at max level and at that point you will be looking for your permanent arsenal. The old reliable shotgun can be put on display in your camp.
---
&gt; All guns an weapons degrade super fast.
---
I find some wear out faster than others.  I main a Gatling on one toon and it seems to last much longer than any other weapon.
---
Good good let the hate flow
---
I didn't know how to take vid captures from the share button, as in I didn't know it saved the last 15 mins. I just learned that from this post. It did cross my mind to capture, but I thought I had to sit and watch it happen as it records, and was more concerned about saving my items. TIL
---
I’d love to have plans in shops divided by what they are plans for, armor weapons, settlement objects, recipes etc
---
U dont have to pop chems all the time, that's the beauty of it. I only pop when large crowds or big bosses.
---
&gt;This is why the tool was aligned mostly around how much one can extract from dedicated buyer - which raised comments it's overly optimistic. We've adjusted the wording and added a 'realistic vendor price' parameter to help clear this out, and will continue working on wording to reduce confusion.
---
This is why most seasoned players thinks Fed76 is a joke when it comes to pricing &amp; that Fed76 is out of touch.
---
Changing wording will mean nothing. It's just PR speak. Their fundamental model is wrong. 
---
It isn't about what you can extract from a dedicated buyer (whatever the hell that means) but just what the average market price is. 
---
Serums are a prime example. People kept pushing the narrative that they go for 500-1000 caps when in reality it was 200-500. I know Fed76 didn't have serum pricing but it's the mentality of "dedicated traders" VS what the market was actually doing that I'm highlighting. They're not even that close. 
---
It's good they're getting community feedback but even that can be gamed. We'll have to see if this feature helps present realistic pricing. If their pricing model isn't just based on market price only, it'd probably still be considered a joke.
---
At the time it was sitting at zero, and at that time yes upvotes do matter for visibility. No point in posting bugs if no one can even see it and learn about it.
---
That works. 
---
I was in battle....
---
not really even if you need five or more hits to do it you could still kill a legendary quickly enough for people to not be able to tag unless you nerf the damage so much that you need multiple people in order to kill any regular legendary mob and that just won't be fun, especially for solo-players
---
I've thought about doing that. I have the raider marauder (the x01 raider PA) with the vault girl. Looks pretty good.
---
It’s aim is off and the damage seems inconsistent
---
I remember when I was level 12 someone dropped me a BOS Officers suit, it was my favorite under armor in FO4 and I didn’t know how rare or tough it would be to get it, and someone dropped it for me. Still wearing it today 1800 hours and 400+ levels later. Ha ha 
---
(I’ve also since then modded it to be shielded.)
---
As far as I know 100 is max everything can go up to it
---
Damage was changed from multiplicative to additive. Used to get extra damage by stacking as many sources as possible. That extra damage evaporates with the change.
---
It’d be a great idea to get a level 45 it’ll make a huge difference in damage. It shouldn’t be too hard to find though
---
Edgy. Go back into your mom's basement. Your fat ass is weighing down the stairs
---
Is a new leveling system for the enemies
---
You do if you don’t want the debuffs. I just life with my junkies debuffs but there is no question that it wouldn’t be balanced to give mutants the same damage boost considering all the upsides you already get from mutations. 
---
I agree mutants is not usable now. 50% is just too much though. Nobody would ever be a junkie and everybody would be mutant.
---
&gt;You didn't give any actual examples on why you felt like roleplay was ruined, special was pointless, game felt empty, etc etc
---
Again, why should I? I've given reasons, do you want me to cite sources too? Mental.
---
&gt;Your opinion just surprised me cuz it wasn't my experience at all and I was hoping you had more details instead of just angry generalizations
---
Well that's fab for you but for myself and the **vast** majority of those who have played and reviewed this game, it is more than angry generalisations.
---
&gt;but alrighty
---
Are you 12?
---
What platform you on?
---
Fair change then. Can’t see what the issue is. (Main Junkies, Alt Bloodied)
---
Dumb fucking comment.EDIT:
---
The guy who deleted his ignorant comment about the OP (unprovoked mind you) Vault_O_dweller, has now sent me ignorant and harassing messages to my inbox. How mature.
---
Ok, Thanks!
---
Yes of course, as always. Funny how these people are always the only one that don't know how to use the share button on a PS4.
---
If this exploit really exists, there must be a forum, or a video somewhere explaining how to do it.
---
I second the idea to retire it to a display if it’s been your main gun for 25 levels.
---
For "resilient" mobs (which die only from melee) you can do 99% damage with regular gun and then run in and finish them over with Alt attack (i.e. weapon hit). Worked nicely for my bloodied commando build using tesla on resilient robots. Kind of makes it more challenging and entertaining IMO, definitely no need for melee/heavy gunner build.
---
Yeah I have one good 3 star, so I'll just wait it out.
---
Some of the magazines you can find are actually 2D minigames you can play in your pipboy. Pick up all the magazines you see and you'll eventually get one.
---
That's literally all this subreddit is. People have been saying for months that we need a balance, and then it happens, and then people complain that its not exactly the way they wanted it. Then they get all pissy and down vote you because your opinion doesn't go along with the hivemind. I'm with you 100%. The game needed a balance, and so far it looks good.
---
Well for the time being the brotherhood having no presence you could RP it as YC just going through the motions to get their hands on that military grade tech. When the brotherhood finally shows up you could be in it for #1, yourself. You work with the brotherhood to have the suckers pay you and arm you, and then you line your pockets with their goods and never really try and help them beyond enough to keep access to their shiny toys.
---
You can also get locked into the grenade aiming animation that causes similar issues.
---
People will buy steel?
---
I have a god rolled...junkies +33% vats hit. It 1 shots almost everything in VATS, but I noticed I could snipe shite with a 0% hit chance, and miss shite with a 90% hit chance. I could one shot lvl 68 super mutants, but take 3 shots to kill a low level ghoul reaver. It's the most inconsistent weapon in game, and that holster bug was the nail in the coffin for me.
---
What do you mean 2-3k? I thought they were all bought with scrips?
---
Almost funny...almost.  If it wasn't for the level of projection, now I kind of feel bad for you.
---
nope. you can submit a bug report but they'll just say they cannot award missing score.
---
Neat story, especially on a console where you can merely press a button and have the last 15 minutes saved into a video... But there's no proof. Another wild fabricated story.
---
As the my tag says 'settler', but am i hell joining them if i have a choice. I'll do shit for cool stuff though!
---
I would love to see a modified Fatman being able to create nuked flora. Like using a mini nuke to get one bush to mutate for like 30 seconds or something.
---
We don't get what we get. It's something that can be argued against before going live
---
yup that's how it work, then you can find your video in your library under fallout 76 section
---
No sadly.
---
I've been doing that for a while now, but I'm never gonna use them so I switched to buying imposter sheepsquatch recall cards.
---
Sacrifice a goat to Todd and pray to RNGezus.
---
Bulk the scrap. It saves a TON of space.
---
Thank you very much for doing and sharing this.
---
Would you be able to share how Explosive and Exectioner's legendary effects will be calculated in the future? Also additive, or maybe explosive is multiplicative?
---
I approve of the lunchboxes as we'll eventually having nothing to spend our gold on since they're currently all plans.
---
Depends. The BSSS combat knife is the strongest. Using buffs it’s around about 200 now. It was 650 (Combat Knife only. Comparatively the same Bowie Knife did 450) The normal knives ranged around 150-200. They now hit around 100. So even with the 30% buff against specific enemy types, they don’t hit anywhere near as hard. This saddens me because the whole point of the character was to get on and choose a knife at random and run with that for the day. In order to stay knives only I have to use the Bloodied ones full time since the rest don’t hit as hard. Large enemies are almost impossible to kill before dying because health is insanely low along with damage output. It’s flat out not going to kill a Sheepsquatch and it also rules out being able to kill the Encryptid with my Troubleshooters Switchblade
---
Unnecessary backstory on that switchblade. If you remember the early days of the game, there wasn’t a purveyor, but also Watoga had legendary robots. I used to make my legendary runs by checking the 2 Watoga vendors for legendaries people sold to the vendors. I found the TSS switchblade for 16 caps at the train vendor and picked it up. I would run around and 3 shot each of the robots. A few months later I built a character that used only knives. It hit 50 and everything fell into place during Mischief Night. It felt amazing. I’d rush Assaultrons blasting me full force and I’d stab them while they hit me. I ran around that event stabbing everything and it was single handedly the most fun I ever had in this game. Eventually I soloed the Encryptid by using a full suit of Troubleshooters armor and Healing Salves so I could heal. That was one of my proudest achievements, as well as killing the queen solo using a BSS switchblade. I’m sad that now it’s not going to be a viable weapon against anything that isn’t a protectron or eyebot
---
Yeah that seems to be a feature of the Strangler Heart armor.
---
Say no to drugs.
---
What's stopping people from just sitting in events and doing nothing in that case ?
---
I know right 😂
---
Same thing last night. Went from 204 to 207 in one event. It was awesome.
---
I don't know if this is the same.
---
I was on last night (Xbox), and ran into a camp with a vendor offline. I didn't think it was offline, due too a lately, vendor screen bug (screen off, even though it's plugged in and working). Turns out it was offline, and I got all these things for free (stimpaks, radaway, antibiotics, etc...). I messaged the owner, too thank him, and that's when he told me the vendor was offline, and that he set prices for the items. I felt bad, and gave him some caps, but honestly I was scared that this would happen with mine. So, I torn down my vendors.
---
The guy didn't have any generators.
---
JOIN OR DIE!!!!
---
the Enclave and the BoS are enemies? Against each other? Well they oppose each other. 
---
And if you’ve done the whole original story quest, your technically the General of the Enclave.
---
Yeah. Me too since last update.
---
Wait really? Wow so keeping daisycutter had a point after all...
---
Do you have a source you can point me to by chance, is this a PTS thing?
---
You can get alot of the camp plans in workshop defences, or you can buy some in some vendor bots
---
You will find plans as you play or you can buy some in whitespring resort.
---
I really liked resilient robots event in burrows today... Real challenge for my bloodied commando running around and finishing robots off with Alt-attacks (melee hit with weapon).
---
If some combinations require special armor sets + perks + tactics - why not? At least its not WestTek/radiation rumble mindless grind again and again and again...
---
I have never been able to loot him for this reason 😩
---
Doubly so for you.
---
The sacrificial blade mod already changes the machete to look like Kremvh's Tooth, and since it's a mod and not a skin you can give it away.
---
Again I was just curious what made you feel how you felt, wasn't calling you incorrect or anything 
---
I assumed you made this post for discussion but I guess you just wanted to vent and that's fine, have a good one dude
---
Yeah basically any box or container is also a stash. Whitesprings has tons of plans for these boxes
---
Well they are simultaneously giving enemys more HP and drastically nerving the damage output of any build\*, so it's to be expected for things to become bullet-sponges or at least a lot more so than it was the case before hand.
---
\*at least any meta/min-max build that utilizes more than the basic damage perk cards at rank 3 as those are only loosing 7.4% of their damage (unless they are melee that looses way more (about 34.5% assuming 15str)) anything that uses more damage modifiers is severely punished.
---
Settler wanderer was the first for me lmfao, didn't even know that it was the rarest ally when I got her, hell I didn't even know you could have allies then.
---
Need to address the accuracy issues the the gauss weapons i ground so hard to get.
---
The other day I was running through the swamp when a settler who was coping wood just stood up in front of me. I accidentally punched his head off with my DCG.
---
I can't wait to have accidents with BoS
---
Been so since launch. Doubt they'll ever fix it.
---
I would *love* to be able to farm some brotherhood/outcasts or whatever.
---
&gt;I assumed you made this post for discussion but I guess you just wanted to vent and that's fine, have a good one dude
---
I did originally but tbh considering the mostly negative feedback, I jumped the gun and I apologise.
---
You too.
---
Oh damn. Well then my V40Bash Minigun will work out swell.
---
I think you're right in general but not regarding damage rework. 
---
For me it's people not one shotting everything but the reason for the hate/concern is different. For some it's the power fantasy bring brought into check while for others it's all about time &amp; resource efficiency.
---
Since everything is scaled the meta shouldn't change any but people who are complaining make it out to be otherwise.
---
Que? You can make double sided walls right now on the live version.
---
I was building a base and it let me place a door frame facing two different directions for the double sided wall effect, just snapped into place.
---
this is a wasteland, not all wastelanders are friendly to others. I immediately one shot every legendary I see to loot it in events like those, and will initiate PvP on anyone who accidentally tags me post-event or in the wild. It's part of the Raider gameplay bro.
---
Oh for sure. I agree and disagree because if you know the ins and outs of this game you can take any build half assed or not in any situation and be okay if you stay on your toes and watch your back. A lot of people use the builds as a fully autopilot vessel rather than a compliment to their play style and it shows with some of the comments about the nerf. I will check out your post too I’m always interested in some cold hard data.
---
The 100s of plans discourages me because they are probably all mounted Christmas plans!
---
Preciated!
---
Leaches gonna leach.  Been there. Know exactly how you feel. So sorry.
---
Eat your own words for a change.
---
Thank god I just hate losing ap because I forgot to bring food with me
---
Yes, them.
---
I dont like it. I hope it does not go live. It will break even more.
---
TL;DR he wants some downvotes
---
Yes - i think my rifleman build will be impacted the most by this - even though the build is pretty optimized, he is still my weakest character when it comes to large bosses like sbq and squatches -
---
Take workshops. You’ll get a ton of plans. A lot of them do this.
---
I Agree entirety
---
Why? You have radiating and poisonous spiders there? I'd move if i were you .)
---
It should but as it stands you'll have to submit a ticket for a refund and on all likelihood get to keep the bundle.
---
I never notice the weight of the mini-nukes since I run around with ordinance express equipped to help with all the plasma grenades I pick up to aggro mobs and mirelurk queens.
---
Roger. Hope not to shitty. Seems like they just keep making it easier and easier, when I just want it to be more hard core.
---
The only reason i save mini nukes is to exchange them in the stupid ammo converter
---
Lol, megaluigi your going viral😂
---
yeah this is kind of fair but as some people mentioned many will still need their bullion for other things unless you've been playing for a long time or just don't need any of the plans, I'll probably be buying 2-3 max a week just for opening them at big events on the week end, hoping for others to open some too.
---
Idk if I have ever seen anyone use a plasma rifle in this game. Seems strange. I think plasma guns need a buff of some kind.
---
Lol, hopefully it wont come to that.
---
Grinding for optimal gear setup just to NOT get weaker every level isn't the best kind of progression in my opinion. Grinding for optimal gear setup should be rewarding.
---
Also at what enemy level cap lvl50 weapon will not be enough in your openion? 150, 200? At some point, the weapon should progress, right?
---
They could *at least* do a round robin/roll for loot system.
---
What do you mean an "armor type"?
---
Like power armor vs no power armor, or like leather vs metal vs something else?
---
AA, TS and Instigating didn’t change
---
Pic please. Sounds kind of cool.
---
I have the dumb, how do you submit a ticket to get a refund?
---
Ugh building really is a pain now 🤦‍♀️
---
I heard rumors of weapons dropping at higher levels (above current max). Do you know if this is true?
---
Do you have a specific reason?
---
Like leather, metal, trapper, raider, marine, scout, combat. Not power armor.
---
I believe the Mr. Pebbles version does as well.
---
I will have no problem with it on my Bloodied build. I had already nerfed myself a few weeks ago by moving points from other categories into INT for more experience gains. With the Legendary Perk system letting me extend the number allotted Perk Points, I will be able to put more points back into Perception, Luck, and Agility to bring my damage back up to where it is now, which is around 200 damage per bullet. I can still kill things just fine, even at that lower amount. Sure, it might take an extra bullet or two, but meh.
---
PC only and [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) only. Does not work on Steam.
---
I just finished hers quests and the ones you do for her relating to the Raiders from Crater and I honestly feel like I got enough time with her and I liked her. I think there needs to be a few more quest givers of her kind because I've been playing for about 40 hours and I can tell she is one of the only interesting characters I've met that isnt a wastlanders NPC or the Overseer.
---
Metro is a book and game series if you didn't know but yeah it has these giant half spider half Scorpion creatures that make nests in the dark underground tunnels. Good news is they hate light. Bad news is bullets don't work on their shells.
---
Beth does like using nerfs to fix things rather than buffing useless stuff like nocturnals.
---
Oh well. Maybe make TSE great again xd
---
I wonder when they'll add a Skyrim holotape
---
Use them all the time, troubleshooter explosive, executioner and recently picked up a bloody and an explosive hunters. I run gunsmith 3 and it seems fine.
---
Nothing makes me roll my eyes more than people whining about people whining about downvotes.
---
Never done it but a quick Google gives me this:
---
HTTPS://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10
---
Still that's 17 lunches per week if you spend max gold on 'em.  Not bad, really.
---
damn
---
Lol...yea...ur probably right
---
I was in the same boat on this. After getting my ass handed to me for 20 minutes I messaged a couple random high lvl players and one come to my aid and didn't want anything in return. The community is the best parts about this game. If teams had been implemented earlier than I think this wouldn't even be an issue and vault 94 would probably still be open.
---
Their track record with changes. We have something now that kinda work, even non bloodied. Whats going to happen when they make such significant changes nobody knows. And it sucks to be nerfed. (I am a junkie.) Middle of the road people like me gets even crappier. Not really happy with that.
---
If you use Enforcer, don't care about DPS, or are playing a supportive roll then it could be worth keeping hold of for sentimental reasons until you grow away from it
---
I'd make a new post, list your system, and ask for help. Hopefully someone with a private server will help you out.
---
BLESS
---
Skyrim
---
That’s really up to you but I would upgrade to something better personally.
---
Agreed. A nerf is not useful by itself. Buffs are required to make the game better. Hope they bring that in the near future.
---
What are daily ops? Haven’t heard anything about this.
---
I know what you mean. I thought it was meant to be a survival game!! Too much handholding now
---
I had stuff go missing after putting my vendors back up.  They were offline for months and nothing went missing then within days of hooking them back up, stuff is missing from my stashbox?  
---
I'm on PC and it happened but all the people who think something isn't real unless it happens to them call bs or downvote etc.
---
The game is full of bugs, people.  But oh noooo, not this bug.
---
🙄
---
Was Furious also affected by this? I finally managed to snag a Furious Minigun and it would bum me out if it got hit hard.
---
you can make double sided doorways on Live but you can't replace them with regular walls
---
Yeah I finally found it &amp; you’re right it was so dark I could hardly see it. I have it on top of my seed shed now &amp; it looks pretty cool. Oh I didn’t even know it was being downvoted, &amp; is it an unwritten rule not to use emojis then?! If it is I’d like to know for future reference. Thanks again.
---
Oh, its a reskin. I thought I found something unique :/
---
Is this a rant rant?
---
No.only enemies scale to the max of their area.
---
Last update seemingly broke them, sorry.
---
You have shown you are not with my time. As much as I agree with what you just said you obviously can't comprehend certain things. Bye
---
Same here, great for everything but. But its my favorite build
---
its simple, Imagine pay 5$ to watch a movie and get 45 minutes of adverts 4 a 2 hours movie...
---
Then imagine paying 15$ to skip the adverts... and directly saw the movie... same mechanic...
---
The vines work pretty well with the Responder skin, but look weird with Hellfire
---
Instigating is still nice with high damage weapons. An instigating gauss pistol with a sneak attack will one shot a level 100 super mutant.
---
Maybe now they will have some use. The lack of viable build diversity was a problem.
---
New thing on the PTS, coming...next major patch, I believe. Or soon, anyway.
---
Would you accept this nerf if they buffed other aspects? Make Junkies (and any other builds) closer to Bloodied?
---
Not gonna lie its pretty cool but the shoulder bushes I'm not a fan of.
---
Oh ok. Thank you. So my stash is safe. Cool beans! They can have the crap in my vending machine. No one's buying it anywho.
---
Especially with one wasteland coming, I'd really like to see lv 200+ enemies that are worth using junkies/bloodied against, and all other legendary weapon prefixes buffed to make them viable as alternatives.
---
Instead I am worried the direction we are heading is not one where we get to enjoy using optimized builds, but rather  a place where the game is a lot harder and enemies a lot more bullet spongey in future:/
---
Name it something and hang it in your CAMP
---
People like you are why I barely ever have a chance at getting good loot. I’m stuck in a cycle of getting immediately knocked and not progressing because “ThIs iS a WaStElAnD”
---
That makes sense. It's not as much pay to win as pay to actually enjoy.
---
Oh, I thought you meant vendor. Do buy any scrip till your over lvl 50
---
Not drunk, not tired. Not sure what happened.
---
I didn't worry too much about it since I was going to character swap anyways, so I just finished up what I needed to do then went back to the main menu.
---
So it's actually not a bug?
---
I believe it’s one of the new legendary perks coming, gives the ability to passively produce lightweight mini nukes over time (check Nuclear Proliferator https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Legendary_perks)
---
Unfortunately all my other weapons are on mule account (steam) and Beth don't let steam players on the PTS so I can't transfer them to my main.
---
While having an entirely new location would be a lot of fun... somehow incorporating it into Whitespring would give it another purpose and could encourage more players to flock there as a 'central hub' - which I think seemed to be the original idea. I love the Whitespring, but there's very little to actually do there.
---
Dude this should've been fixed by meow...
---
My main is Junkies, my Alt Bloodied and I think this is a good change. It only REALLY hurts those with a large number of different sources of buff. A Junkies Rifleman will baseline at 5 Sources of Damage buff, that will come in at no more than a 10% loss on Damage. 
---
It really, really hits the Melee folks who stack food buffs with all the other damage sources.
---
PC is also spotty.  On a private server, things are better, but certain areas will drop to like 20-25 frames, namely the Sons of Dane barn.  It depends on the server, time of day, if my wife is watching Netflix, whether the moon is waxing, etc.
---
I have to. Can only hope for the best and that sneak dont become completely useless.
---
That would be terrible. But I am hopefull and think the devs are making and effort to balance the game.
---
Time to get yourself a nice level 20 Fixer with .38 automatic receiver, long recon scope, stinging magazine, and choice of stock to max out weapon health.... and switch to Commando ;)
---
have you seen the other cards? I can't imagine he was the one getting laughed at.
---
What's a fixer if I may ask?
---
It's a change: we used to be able to paint over the vines, but after Wasteland was released they became permanent (video has Capt. Noob painting over an old set with Hellfire: https://youtu.be/GICbwK1m_P0?t=108)
---
Sneak is a huge part of this game. Its a build that requires skill and for you to actively try to remain sneaky. I would imagine the devs dont want to nerf stealth to heavily.
---
Ah, I see. I thought you just forgot "the" and meant "the metro" :)
---
Aside from some culinary tools and large choppers, any fighting style knife or dagger is going to have a point.  Some daggers are purely for thrusting and lack a sharp edge, but I’ve never seen a rounded or blunt tipped fighting knife.  A dagger can be double edged, but knives are usually single edged.
---
Edit: bad speling en grammer.
---
True enough! I just want my fellow explosion enthusiasts to feel the same thrills I get using my weapon of choice.
---
It really is. I did all tadpole n possum challenges and bought most of the outfits/mods
---
Ive gotten about 5 extra badges after doing the repeatables an Campfire tales almost everyday for the last 2 months
---
they work no matter what, powering them just shows it on the map.
---
There’s a few great places for finding pieces of T-45, T-51b, and T-60 power armor at your level so I’d say keep a look out for chassis and mix and match those as you find them until you can get your hands on ultracite or x-01 power armor. As for weapons, I think your Gatling gun works just fine for where you’re at, it’s personally one of my favorite weapons.
---
Don't be sorry :) I'm somewhat happy to know it's not me causing an issue
---
Am trying to get a legendary one for my heavy gunner so the splodies get used rarther than left alone and frightened in a paper bag!
---
My vending machine.
---
Edit: most players vending machines will have these plans and other camp decor (seats, lights, wall hangings, etc). I would suggest that you not buy plans from vendor bots until later when you know which ones can *only* be bought from them and when you have more disposable income.
---
After playing it for awhile, I can tell you bloodied/unyielding is still top dog. With all builds nerfed, maybe even more so.
---
I have 5 characters, all bloodied. I’d have been fine with a nerf just to my builds. Maybe a buff to something like Berserkers. Would have made me more interested in a different play style.
---
Goddamnit this is exactly why I was dreading One Wasteland...
---
Built my house at Helvetia because it’s in the forest and only level 6 scorched attack my base and easily get taken down by the turrets... Now because I’m level 400+ these enemies in the forest are going to be level 100? Turrets already take up so much space I can only afford 2 of them, can’t build more to compensate for the ridiculous level difference now. My base is gonna get leveled anytime someone shows up.
---
What about the throwaway ammo weapons I carry specifically for low level areas to deal with low level stuff so I don’t use my best ammo? Are those gonna be useless now that everything is gonna be level 100? And they’re adding a damage nerf to all weapons on top of this?
---
F*ck this entirely. If every enemy in the game turns into a goddamn bullet sponge and I have to spend most of my playtime farming ammo I’m done with this game. 
---
(Taking the ammo factory is gonna be completely useless if this shite goes live. You get like 200 556 every what, 30 minutes? You’ll use way more than than taking the damn place if all the enemies are level 100, let alone defending it.)
---
It’s all RNG
---
From what I’ve seen:
---
As long as the tent is placed BEFORE any Scorched spawn, like before the “prepare for the scorched assault” it works. It seems to work more often when placed at an angle on the right side spawns. One tent can do it, 2 is basically guaranteed. 
---
I’ve never done this myself but having taken full advantage of it, and had the chance to do today as well.
---
Alright, thanks!
---
Wow so I guess I have just been unlucky lol
---
No but there is a perk card that displays it on the compass.
---
Are you on pc? I can build some for you, if you like.
---
Intersting! Didnt imagine someone would be intersted in having their own build being directly nerfed.
---
In actual damage or pip-boy? Energy damage is apparently only broken as a visual bug in the pip boy; actual combat damage *should* be in line with the rest of the nerfs.
---
Random encounters are random
---
No it was already garbage
---
Yeah I don't get that mentality. I don't believe stuff in stash went missing. But it was just magazines for me, and I did have some in both stash and machines, so maybe who knows
---
They still can kill most mobs in one hit. Don’t need to make a black hole.
---
I never start the event but I always go when I see it and usually get all the pilons and just try to stay alive and hopefully get to tag the sheepy before it's killed
---
\&gt;&gt;  If you join in and get the guaranteed anti-sneak mutation and the melee-required enemy mutation, and you’re a stealth rifleman, you can basically pack up and leave the daily op. Your build is worthless in that situation. 
---
Its not that bad actually - melee-required is only for the last hit. You can still do 99% damage with you favorite gun and then just run close and finish them off with alt attack. Makes its more challenging but doable. 
---
As of sneak not working - hard to tell, but I suspect working stealth will make Daily Ops very easy. Even without stealth riflemen/commando can still do line of sight hiding preventing incoming damage and exposing shortly for sniping back.
---
No it was the best in the game my dude
---
Well dang I was planning on grinding NW for that inferno mk3 skin or hellfire skin. Oh well. Guess I'll just embrace the bush.
---
That's what I would suspect, as fast traveling is rife with issues as is
---
It's so disappointing. :( I'm a hoarder and want to display my entire collection, but it's so impractical when it comes to budget. 
---
That said, this is great, OP! I love the toy shelves and use of the candy bowl.
---
settlers vs raiders bro. if you want good loot join the raiders and rightfully take what's yours!
---
People love to blame everything on RNG but do you honestly believe there's not some factors in the code that make the more desirable stuff harder to get?
---
Add it to the list, ha
---
Its strange to me that the fatman is so weak on this game. Its not like it was OP in any other Fallout but it was certainly viable.
---
So level scaling and no food and hunger relevance. Not really a survival game
---
YES DO IT
---
That’s in daily ops (I wasn’t taking time to check wendingo spawns during Colossus, that event is hectic!) , and they spawn a set amount based on your ammo type. Which is funny when 5mm is tuned for miniguns but you have a Gatling gun. 60-90 round stacks in every body is ace... ultracite drops too. But that was 6-24 ultracite 50 rounds per. But given I can still kill most enemies in 4-6 bullets, I come out ahead.
---
they can, but you can also use it to craft lots of ammo
---
people buy ammo
---
We're you fast traveling when it happened? From vendor or stash?
---
I don’t think there are very many. Most heavies don’t have very many. Go to a workbench to check how there are. Buy the plan and scrap them.
---
Could also try freezer grenades. It works wonders on SBQ when she lands.
---
Who cares, there's more than enough damage to go around.
---
Holding back to avoid one shotting everything kind of feels like doing that anyway.
---
Not really just switch weapons and shut up 😬
---
Failing the event. I've seen it happened. People will stand around and do nothing and then when the event fails make a confused emote.
---
We're you fast traveling when it happened, or just like hanging out somewhere?
---
Lol you're telling me nocturnal is better than my bloody melee build I just finished fine tuning. I cant stand Bethesda make the other shit better don't just nerf everything into the ground.
---
Thanks, I’ll have to invest in it sick of nothing but wood armour in every single crate
---
I think there's only 3 mods for it. 
---
I guess I'll have me a scrap party then. Any idea which vendor sells the plan?
---
I gave 250, and that leaves me with less than 100 cork in my scrapbox.  Meanwhile I'm back near 5k steel in just a week after emptying it out.  The steel goal was reasonable.  The cork goal was not.  I suspect Beth has inflated the the cork number they report by an order of magnitude.
---
That's not really true. Certain stuff will only spawn at certain random encounter locations. Tamable pets and the Responder vendor bot are a perfect example, only specific areas will spawn them.
---
How long have you been able to one shot things as a Junkie or Bloody? You may be bored with it, but some of the newer people that are just now getting builds and weapons that can kill an enemy their level in 1 or 2 shots may like the break from shooting something 5 or 6 times.
---
NO NO NO ! Fallout 76 is a GAME not a playpen ! You only get the prize if you tag the enemy, that’s the challenge. If you fail the challenge, you don NOT get the prize.
---
I am also having the same problem and would like to get my story quest done .
---
Yes that's gotta be true. Same reason why everyone on market wants a 3* bloodied fixer or handmade and zero people are willing to trade them...not many have them. I've rolled 100s of 3* ranged weapons from Purveyor and most are mutants Slayer lol
---
I was gifted a low level bloodied suppressed pump-action shotgun by a high level player, which now hangs on my wall. Keep the memories and look for a level-appropriate and build-appropriate legendary for your daily shooter. If you feel nostalgic, you can always take it out for a spin when you like.
---
If thats correct its not to bad I suppose. (For me, not those hit hard like melee. I feel bad for all worse off than me.)
---
I'm good man. I can't play 24/7 like it sounds like you can.
---
Don’t try to solo it.
---
I used up fuckton of ammo when I tried with 1 other dude who was spamming mini nukes (seriously, I’ve no idea how he had so many)
---
  He helped keep the adds away but I don’t think he did much to the boss.
---
Another event where we had 8 players? Much more doable. Maybe 1k of 2mm EC out of my BFFR gauss minigun.
---
I've seen that you can still buy from unpowered vendors, but haven't made a purchase from one, just skimmed their items. Thats why I just stored mine now instead of taking off line
---
Okay good to know. Ive been collecting pieces, the Raider stuff is just the first I could use. I have a handful of t45 and t51 pieces that I'm waiting to swap in when im high enough level. 
---
I'm wondering if I screwed myself by going to 15 int so fast cause now I don't think I can get the higher level perks from there until I'm level 50+ as ill have to take strength perks with my level ups.
---
Edit: also will I be choosing between bloodied/junkie weapons like everyone else or do power armor build works differently?
---
They could make it turn flora into nuked flora, and give it a small chance to drop high radiation fluids, and hardened/glowing masses from kills or hit enemies. Then at least it would have a good use.
---
Every single event will now reward lvl 50 legendaries which was much better then before. Not to mention all the new areas we can farm at now.
---
Heres the thing I was all fine with the idea of a dial back if they wanted to cap bloodied at like 60-70% I would have been 100% ok with that. Its that thing swung at everything and knocked it all down a peg. Melee suffering the hardest now by losing so much damage. Now whats the incentive to run melee you dont hit hard anymore. So why even play anymore unless you like hitting things. They also really didnt make anything better actually you just made it look better by making bloodied and junkies look worse. Why wasnt mutants buffed to stack with mutations? Why werent enemy specific types buffed to like 40% more damage? Its more of the overall nerf to everything is just going to make the enemies spongier and after 1 week everyone is going to complain that it takes too long.
---
EDIT They also didnt change anything about magic weapons still killing the queen quickley or adjusted legacy weps in fact now legacy is the definate way to go since beam splitter explosives can reliably 1 shot still.
---
Gatling guns are decent weapons though I prefer a .50 cal machine gun, if you plan to go heavy gunner make sure to take Stabilized from the INT perks.  INT also has some good perks for PA crafting and lets not forget Batteries Included so those fusion cores don't weigh a ton.
---
Lucked out and got a Two Shot about a month ago. It shreds!
---
Savor those splodies!
---
I like this idea but I think it needs adjusting. If you get all reward just for "being" there then a bunch of AFKers will appear. 
---
I think there should be a system that registers if you participated in the event in a meaningful way. If so, then you are entitled to all of the legendary loot.
---
Thoughts?
---
Okie dokie
---
Haha right how does this make it more fun especially for melee builds looking at a 75% decrease. Melee builds suffer from do many bugs hits not registering five times in a row and now its literally pointless. Going from 2000 about damage to 300 is a fucked up thing to do to your base of players that like killing things and farming legendaries.
---
After 1800 hrs, it’s getting a little too easy. I’m happy with the higher level enemies now. I still don’t see the point in running anything but bloodied. I wouldn’t mind trying something else, but I can’t get over min/maxing (my own fault).
---
The max level in the forest is 25. And for the eastern part of the map, it's 100. At least it seems like this is the case.
---
What is your build
---
Lmao dude...the fact that you can get end-game level 50 legendary gear from **anywhere** in this game isn't a good thing. These should only be available from challenging end-game content.
---
You don't get to the highest item level on WoW or Destiny just by walking around and farming generic enemies in the open world. That's not how these games are supposed to work.
---
Go squeak somewhere else rat.
---
They nerfed everything. Bloodied just shows the biggest change because it's a bigger damage number.
---
It's seeming like they re-worked how the damage multiplayers work/stack. Not a "nurf" to any one specific build but a change to all weapons/perks/chems that affect some players more than others
---
QQ scrub
---
From my vendor.
---
The guy was hanging around my camp for awhile, then he joined my team, left my camp, and fast traveled back to my camp and swiped a stack of plans from my vending machine.
---
It displayed like he purchased a single one but I received no caps and when I checked my vending the whole stack of plans was gone. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Can we have the same test for non legendaries with just the perks?
---
Sometimes I'll type out a sarcastic reply to a post ranting about something but then just delete it.
---
I was just crafting stuff around my camp when it happened.
---
Ha! Good point. But hey, who doesn’t want a card to help others if you die?
---
The floater grenades that are already worse than frag grenades?
---
Take it for what it's worth, but I am definitely not making up my story. I got the same gripes everyone else does with the game, but I still play everyday and aint tryna tell no lies on it, they do a good enough job at messing it up without making stuff up honestly. Nothing wrong with being skeptical, but don't be willfully ignorant either, ya know?
---
Yeah, hopefully they dint impkement this nerf without revisiting some legendary effects and buffs. Its hard to balance a game but st least this shiws they are trying, right?
---
Doesn’t always work though. I was at a glitched line in the sand event by myself and started spamming the “come here” emote to my public team for about 5 minutes and no one came. Sucks to be you guys, guess I’ll take all that sweet sweet xp for myself 🤷‍♂️
---
thats super cool
---
Mah I'm on pc and would rather have a loot system where I will be garunteed a drop in the legendary enemy at events. Shit I did encrypted the other day was 2/3 pylons and a dude 1 shot the sheepsquatch... ran him away from everyone killed him and took off.
---
Scavenger is best but it's worth getting the raider one just for the dialog.
---
false
---
Stay off my server world, you looney.
---
Good idea.
---
The most notable combo (frequency wise not quality) I get is hunters explosive and what ever 3rd star
---
Dude, I remember my crippling middle launcher from Fallout 4. That was my dedicated big dude gun. We need those strats back in 76.
---
My only issue is yet another handmade skin and nothing for the lever rifle. Not everything can be perfectly tailored for every player.
---
Look at this guy here whining about people whining about people whining about downvotes.  
---
They're made up points!  
---
They don't matter!  
---
I've worked my way through most of grognak
---
Yep. It was a good day today, as almost the whole server was at both events.
---
Finished both with time to spare. The second run, I didn’t even die once!!
---
Still terrifying tho, and I love it.
---
I understand now. I have only been playing since wastelanders but I have +400 hrs. Still not as impresive as you but I know what you mean. I also feel the game gets easier the more you learn about its mechanics.
---
I've actually been to Wheeling Island. I interviewed there for a position. (I worked in the casino industry for 25 years). Is it also still a dog track? That could make for even more interesting games of chance. Betting on Mutant Hound races would be great.
---
I know that's the exact reason why I changed from bloodied melee to bloddied heavy gunners. The amount of big pve bugs still exists in the game is frustrating and especially for melee builds.
---
Ah, alright. That sounds pretty decent then. I also prefer the Gatling gun over the Minigun as well.
---
I just got a 1260 atom refund for the raider waster bundle so I can confirm that it works and you get to keep it.
---
If you have access to MODUS you should have a decent chance of finding the plans there. You can also check the Watoga Shopping Centre.
---
See I've done that in the past, but nothing was in the vendor. When powered on, the items would appear. Tested that out with me and my boy. 
---
Maybe it's changed, but all items were free in this instance even though the owner set prices. That's why I thought it was hella weird.
---
I have a Two Shot RW Mirv Fatman, with Demo Expert 5 and Grenadier 2, and while it looks great, it does shit damage and somehow missed everything clearly within its explosion. I get better results from a single Nuka grenade, and that's just not right.
---
I agree, I just figured with how badass and awesome the BOS is we would get some amazingly cool shit. But we will have to pay for that lol. Workout bench is cool tbh
---
People are able to get 400 dmg on unarmed on the pts. That is enough damage to one hit most mobs. 
---
Don’t forget perks like inciser and swing speed. Power attacks are a thing as well.
---
Instigating with power attack damage would be massive improvement on damage now.
---
Thank God. I was worried my current weapons and armor would be rendered useless
---
Unfortunately everytime i have seen people sharing tags on legendaries, its always a one star that drops. Or a nocturnal god roll. I dont know which is worse.
---
Thank you much. Google failed me looking for mods. The plan is sold by the Free States vendors.
---
both twisted muscles and talons effect it assuming you aren't using perks that boost mutations that's an extra 25% each, so 290 additive and 2934.6 multiplicative for Perk + 15 str + buffs*1 + adrenal reaction + bloodied*3 + full unyielding and twisted muscles + talons
---
The 3k seems a bit high and I can't 100% confirm it as I have some mutations and effects that also reduce my damage slightly (still do 10k+ dmg on stealth hits though so it's not unrealistic by any means) I haven't seen the pip-boy dmg numbers go up that much but that may be update errors or me just not checking enough as I have done 2,5k and more on non stealth, non-crit spot hits
---
So you're bring a whiny little prick about two out of the what... thirty to forty plus items?
---
Not really if its a slap across the board. Why werent the effects individual tweaks? How often do they visit balance patches? Why does the handmade and fixer still outperform the other rifles? How long have bloodied and junkies remained on top? Why are legacy weapons now going to be the 100% sure fire way too one shot making the meta even more linear. Theyre trying a half baked way to make the game even grindier because thats the goal to make it as much grind as possible.
---
Decreasing damages for players and increasing enemy damages and resistances puts a wider gap between killing an enemy that it may be harder for even lower level players.
---
PLEASE NO. JUST LET US UPGRADE OUR CURRENT GEAR.
---
"Hey you, your finally awake..."
---
Wait those, were non ninja numbers?
---
Fine. Fuzzy jr. and i will take our help where its appreciated &gt;:)
---
Beth should have based the interface on the Load Baring terminal interface. Ie: 157 10mm rounds detected, Do you wish to trade 150 rounds for x points?
---
Radiation rumble counts ore and total kills?
---
Fuck. And I'm just a full health junkie.
---
yes they were just flat damage without ninja
---
Too many caps? You can dump them in my inventory. bethnet ID is Eparch
---
Mine was showing like they were purchased one at a time. Just good info to share
---
What is it to you anyways? You're not on PC and you don't know how ridiculously op they are. Beam splitter .50 cal shouldn't be in the game.
---
I would think one or the other. If any of the two requirements are met then you get your loot.
---
Oof. My theory was something fast travel related. Sucks.
---
There’s a bug where people get kicked. I’ve created teams where it says someone else on the team got kicked and I certainly didn’t do it.
---
You should know by now, proof is against the rules in this sub!
---
Any time I see anyone post proof of an exploit or scam the whole thread gets pounced on by the moderators and deleted!
---
January
---
Bye then
---
My understanding of NW spawns is that there are a fixed set of locations where the PAs and loot crates will spawn, but only a portion of those locations are used in a given match and it's random which ones they are. This has certainly been my experience regarding the crates, but I haven't found enough PA to really be able to say any more on that. Hopefully others can help confirm or deny.
---
You can rock the Excavator armor at your level.  I use it 99 percent of the time and I am level 150.  You get it from the Miner miracles quest.  There are a couple tough robots in the quest that you can avoid instead if fight.  You can learn the plans, make it now and then remake it at level 50.  
---
The torso mod is the only real choice.  Either emergency protocols or kinetic dynamo
---
The thing about power armor is there is no real big difference between acutal damage in game.  The damage resistance numbers bethesda has on them makes them seem wildly different but watch Angry Turtles video on the best power armor on Youtube.  In game its less than 10 percent difference between excavator PA and ultracite PA from 10 ginshots from the same super mutant.  Therefore excavator is the best option for the additional carry weight it has built in.
---
just wearing power armor reduces overall incoming damage by about half.  Chad the vendor bot in Camden Park has both emergency protocols and kintetic dynamo for sale.  Or greg the vendor bot in Grafton.  
---
And rock that gataling gun forever.
---
Very nice, I also have a comic book store called " summer comics" (on pc if you ever see me) just next to summerville bridge,, I sell comics full sets for sale for most editions, I use the hubris wallpaper and buy any kinda poster and game/movie/comic related stuff to go in there, the shop is down stairs and I live upstairs, pop by sometime :) p.s. the camp budget for magazines is a piss taker almost 24% to display all 90+ , which is kinda tricky to do but doable.
---
This is a known issue and is being looked into. You are poster #8,328 about this issue.
---
Yep, now a visiting high level could drag high level robots or ghouls in your CAMP
---
Sorry, no fix for auto-complete. Instead, take a nerf to your build.
---
I think it’s cool.
---
Acid, you don't need too much of it, it's kind of hard to find, the extractor for it helps a lot.
---
I dont think I have ever done the ore runs and not had to kill mobs as running through the mains. Collect 10 ore and kill 6 enemies, end of event all legendaries are available for you to access.
---
This is known
---
I always look for chems, junk, or misc first.  Once in a great while I’ll check a camp that has lots of plans, but not often since everyone sells the same 50 plans, it seems.
---
I can respect that, but I’m definitely not feeling it
---
The Institute is pleased.
---
The Institute will contribute.
---
The Institute will rise again.
---
You don’t have to move your camp.
---
Apparently you need to be in a server that hasn't had the quest completed by anyone else yet.
---
If you're on PC i can jump in to a private server for you to progress the quest.
---
Both of those effect it, as does adrenal reaction!
---
There’s allegedly a hotfix coming to fix it this Tuesday. Afraid you’re just gonna have to do some other quest until then.
---
You wont find much sympathy over trap camps on this sub I'm afraid but craft some explosive bait and blow up his camp. It's always a satisfying response to trap camps.
---
Or raccoons? Opossums was nice
---
Rule 9.
---
More details?
---
Having tried bandolier I now never go without it. I've got 70k  .45 and they weigh absolutely nothing, a must in my opinion.
---
With public teams a thing now and the benefits that come with it I'd swap lone wanderer for inspirational.  I also highly recommend strange in numbers if you've got mutations which I assume you have due to your use of starched genes and class freak.
---
You should also look at sneak and escape artist in agility.  Also mister sandman for 50% additional damage at night..  At lvl 35 with an instigating lever action I was one shotting max level scorched with head shots. 
---
Edit: Also, Gun Fu. I absolutely love Gun Fu.
---
Not sure why you need radicool as a rifleman. I'd have fireproof instead. Rank 2 in that and you can ignore scorchbeasts sonic attacks.
---
With all that being said I have literally no idea if they're available to you at your current level or when they will be.
---
Well i haven't finished the order of mysteries yet
---
I see others have already said this, but congrats! This  (along the upcoming messages) were already decoded by a team of dataminers in a discord server. But you managed to get this one all on your own! 
---
See if you can get the next ones by yourself, they seems harder to me but you might pull it off!
---
The fixer is a varient of the combat rifle with better damage and faster sneak speed baked in.
---
There’s only like one brotherhood thing in the pass tho? And it’s a pretty good one.
---
Bloodied unarmed reduced from 1400 to 300.. that is huge! not worth the risk getting up close and  to get killed in 2-3 hits.. and the game is not worth another build. 
---
Already haven't played much in the last weeks, if the PTS goes live i will have no interest in continuing. 
---
They will just keep nerfing until you're all using rolling pins.
---
No problem. Thank you for your reply!
---
Yeah, seeing the season 2 rewards makes me not care about it at all.
---
Exactly, that makes my point even more reasonable. We deserve more
---
I just played for an hour.  It seems to impact sneak intermittently, and the bonus notifier doesn't show up in VATS.
---
Sneak itself seems broken, enemies detected me immediately in Chinese stealth armor everywhere I went.
---
The auto complete bug is one of the main reasons that is still impossible for many players! Bethesda refuses to help those players afflicted! And no not playing at the time of the reset isn't a solution as 22 hours later it can still happen!
---
Thank you any info helps, i will just have to check a few spots each time I guess, hopefully I’ll get lucky
---
Spawn in an area alone surrounded by another team?   
---
Get stuck in geometry?  
---
Someone nukes right on top of you?  
---
Hackers punch you to death from low orbit?  
---
**I guess you're not "genetically fit".**
---
Cyberpunk+BG3 will have to hold me over
---
Could be wrong but I think the correct answer is it effects us during boss battles, and during pvp?
---
Last night I over heard a giant group of pop talking about how some guy stole their chestpiecr and ace after they tried to help him out. I went to my tent and gave them mine.
---
I also stand outside 76 and give free stims and radaway and water.
---
And if someone buys something from my vendors, I fix their guns for free if they trust me to modify it for them.
---
How/where can I get one?
---
ill be getting a different game lol
---
How are you guys this incompetent? You dont even reply to people! Like give us a day by day update..... we payed to play this bloody game and somehow you guys are still messing things up! TALK TO THE COMMUNITY YOU MORONS
---
Forcing players to change their builds is a great way to lose them to other games. We already have the choice to make new characters with new builds, but we don't have to discard hundreds of hours spent on our mains. If this goes through I suspect there will be a lot less people playing everyday.
---
Remember the fatman from fallout 4? You could put a MIRV and it would launch like 8 nukes, i bet you can find a two shot fatman in fo76, boy i want one now
---
This wasn't my experience. My instigating lever hits for ~1200 normally but was only good for around 400-500 on the PTS.
---
Looks like somebody got upset that they didn't learn their facts before getting in an argument.
---
I always starve to death before I can!
---
How do you upgrade it if the level cap stays the same? We need the cap increased AND the ability to upgrade it.
---
Has anyone got Red menace I've never found one or seen one for sale it's the only one i'm missing too.
---
I’ve never seen him, sorry.
---
Pipe . . . is . . Life . . .
---
pipe is life?
---
PIPE IS LIFE!
---
I believe! I believe!!
---
The imposter's Sheepsquash's corpse regularly despawns because of the sheer amount of robots that spawn during the event!
---
And if it's not that... The explosion has launched the corpse all the way to the forest....
---
You are right. I mean, let us upgrade our current gear TO the new max level AND increase the level cap. My apologies
---
I heard one of those sons of bitches say something like "Sometimes I think about burning this place down" as I went running by it, and I fucking died laughing.
---
This was a couple days ago and I'm STILL laughing.
---
That’s really the only reason I would ever use a repair kit, otherwise why not just use scrap at a workbench?
---
You sound like the guy I was watching earlier with his camera trying to find the body... honestly the only robots that should explode are the sentry bots. AWOL event is the same... gotta run as quickly as possible before it’s flung into the atmosphere.
---
Lvl 245 with two alts. This is news to me. Game changer!
---
Added on both, hit me up!
---
I believe!
---
Pipe is Life!
---
How have I never heard of this before?
---
I ran the the highway between Point Pleasant and Sunshine Meadows industrial farm.
---
There is two random spawn points about half way between each in the middle of the highway, fairly easy to spot if they do spawn.
---
Run from A to B and hop and eventually you'll find what you want .
---
Your auto-correct gets stronger at low health?
---
Are you allowed to describe in detail what the rewards are? I don't know if there's an NDA but I assume just by mentioning BOS cosmetics you have already revealed detail, so can you please post a screen shot or details?
---
Lower level players do and take the amount of damage appropriate to their level as the enemies appear as level-appropriate to them. Enemies will scale to every player’s level all over the map and in events.
---
For example, you’re level 190 and your friend is owned 5. You both come across a Mutie. It’ll be the highest possible level for you and do and take the highest possible damage. Your friend will see the lowest possible level and do and take the lowest possible damage. 
---
Long-winded point: The entire map will be accessible for lower level players and it won’t be harder for them.
---
I spawned at Ingram my first game, so did 5 others, so I bailed. Ended up 2nd place in the match but still no lock. Next match it was only 2 of us and I got there first.
---
Most of these challenges are easy if you are familiar with the maps at all. The only downside is the waiting between matches.
---
It's matter of calibration, and the focus we had calibrating the tool was on 2* and 3* items. Most of 1* items should be calculated as scrip, with only few exceptions - AA lever not being one of those. I'll work on clearing this out.
---
The data is coming from crawling the F76 infosphere as a whole (Facebook groups, Reddit, Discord servers). The data we trust the most (and towards which the algorithm might be skewed) are auctions and biddings - active interactions of multiple people competing to get an item.
---
I legit sold a bloodied buzzblade 1* for 10k once. It's a valid datapoint that would suggest bloodied buzzblades are worth 10k, but it's also a bullshit datapoint, no way that would happen again lol. Instead of focusing on exceptions, we try to capture trends and reflect them in numbers. I say 'we' because collecting the information about those trends is a team effort.
---
Acid, easily.
---
Both
---
Only thing I will bring you is cold steel BOY ! BoS forever.
---
I went to a camp last night and a guy gave me a 3 star hachet, wondering why, I went up stairs and he had a 1on1 deathbattle arena. It was very fun and decorative lol.
---
As for me, I been chasing ppl town with a chainsaw preping ppl for Halloween and made a walk-in haunted house to get to my vendors. I'm so happy when I get a message that says, "OMG U SCARED THE SH*T OUTTA ME!" lol makes it all worth it
---
It hurts in general coming from NV where explosives were fun AND effective. Doubly so when specced into. There are not many things better than loading up Mercy with the GRA Plasma 40mm nades and just letting loose.
---
Ahhhh... i would be pissed ✌️
---
I'm a hoarder, so I thought the point of them was to not use my own Scrap.
---
You think you're slow? I just learnt there was a block button for melee. I'm level 172. 😂
---
400 dmg isn't enough to one hit most mobs by any means super mutants, assaultrons, robobrains,some ghoul types,anglers, gulpers, fog crawlers, mirelurk king/queen, behemoth, sheepsquatch, deathclaw, cave cricket, scorched beast (10 or more hits for that one), it's better if you mean 400dmg without stealth but my problem is not not being able to kill things, it's just that unarmed was hit disproportionately hard, even harder than the meta bloodied stealth commando and I am worried that enemys like the scorched beasts which are annoying enough for melee already will be worse and that some enemys will feel like a brick wall with the HP increases that also come with the patch but I don't know how big those are at all so I am just waiting to try it out and hoping that I don't need to change the build I have come to love playing with
---
Very intersting! It does hit bloodied harder than junkies. But bloodied is still superior to junkies.
---
Only at myself.
---
I just dismissed the things as pay-to-win and a means to save my Junk.
---
What a fool I've been. They're even MORE pay-to-win than I realized!
---
I can see why people were/are so upset with them!
---
So lucky you had that thing on. That’s really well hidden though, most of us would’ve fallen to our deaths lol
---
I already have friends who don't run a specialised build who find enemies too bullet spongy already, it'll be even worse when this patch goes live, I'm sure they'll just give up on the game!
---
Level 3 Hidden Perk Card in Intelligence
---
I wouldn't care that much, but it takes away from the actual problems in the game. There are plenty of things to genuinely complain about and want fixes for, but seeing either self-inflicted or entirely fabricated complaints here drags everybody down and takes legitimacy away from the actual issues
---
thats such a significant damage difference god damn
---
Thanks, I can give that a shot for a while. You've actually found the reenactor there?
---
Well...it’s not a Brotherhood related Season, yeah? Why would the rewards be Brotherhood themed?
---
Well in the PTS uranium fever legendaries are level 100
---
Watched a YouTube digi does gaming made a video
---
It means every gun, even non legendaries are getting a nerf because of how they are changing the damage calculation, its just bloodied and junkies are getting hit hardest as they were multiplied higher than any other!
---
The brotherhood is/was supposed to be released with season 2
---
How much ammo did you spend to get your 1 star pool cue?
---
Honestly I havent seen that one before.
---
Omg 😂 they would have gotten me too only I'd be 100% dead
---
I'm not saying I don't believe you, just keeping my eyes open for more mentions of this
---
Congrats on finished run, though.
---
What else are you using it for?
---
Thx!
---
Nocturnal Rolling Pin
---
Imitation is the... sincerest form of flattery, member.
---
It was pre wastelanders but yea I did.
---
Nope lol
---
For Bloodied builds it isn't too bad, but EVERY WEAPON got nerfed, so people with non perfect builds will be struggling more!
---
CAMP, crafting, etc.
---
TS MIRV is one of my favorite things about this game.
---
They also all have the same power house problem, why?
---
Take my upvote please you beautiful soul.
---
It needs to be a specific type of mining helmet. You can find some of that type at the Miner Monument near Whitespring. You also don't even need to find the mods as an object, you can change it to any type of light by default just using an armor workbench.
---
Also that vault boy light is lots of fun. Most people hate it but since it's almost never used you always get people flocking around you when you turn it on at events lol.
---
I think that by itself is already a form of fix for it. Now that min-maxed builds can't one-shot everything so easily, and higher level players will be fighting higher level enemies and therefore dealing less total damage to them, that constant complaint of legendaries getting one tapped shouldn't be as frequent of an issue, although I doubt it will be eliminated altogether
---
Too much effort to actually create quality content. They are short staffed and bored.
---
Also from your favorite's wheel. Just examine the item from your wheel, and then press the repair hotkey.
---
Just don't call it gambling.
---
Just like those holiday presents and miner pails that we paid roughly 4k caps each for just for a chance at rare plans and items. Or the recent community events where we put in resources for a chance for plans. Totally not gambling ;) ;)
---
I feel like most people either have power armor or other ways on negating fall damage, right?
---
I didn’t get my dailies today either. But this is the first time it’s happened. I should consider myself lucky
---
This is probably sarcastic, but I'm all for making stupid meme builds viable. Perks like revenant and a berserker's/auto-stim combo already made a kamikaze build sort of possible in the game, if there will be legendary perk support for it then it might just be worth trying out for some giggles
---
Oh my god, who the hell cares..
---
No dailies for me either today
---
I'm not sure, but you might be interested to know that taller wire fences with barbed wire at the top were datamined recently. They could potentially come to the shop soon, although not everything that has been datamined has made it to the shop yet.
---
They’re separate though. One is a quest line and one is the new season theme. What does the Brotherhood have to do with Armor Ace?
---
A way to fix it is to look at what exactly did you do before logging out before the update:
---
* Did you play NW? Log into an Adventure or Private server after your last match next time.
---
What did you do before logging into a server **after** the update?
---
* Did you go to the Atomic Shop or the Legendary Run screen or into a NW match **before** joining a public or private server? Yeah, don't do that again.
---
There, fixed. I know I will get downvoted for this comment (don't care, go ahead) and a dozen folks will come up and say they never did any of that and still got the autocomplete bug. The thing is, I never encountered this, and I take extra care to follow the steps outlined above, so as long as I don't encounter it out of the blue, I tend to not believe them. Sorry, just trying to help here.
---
Disclaimer: Two factors that might play into this I think I should mention - my PS4 has a fast drive (SSD), and I'm on 100mbit broadband (LAN, not WLAN). I don't have to wait minutes before I look at the challenges list, but if your machine is slow, you might have to.
---
This sounds brilliant.
---
My gripes with the Faction stuff is at a certain point there isn't much reason to bother with it. Knowing we can not only buy lunchboxes, but there will be a minor trickle of new items sold in-game is fucking amazing.
---
...It even says Repair on the wheel.
---
Was I so reflexively used to the wheel that I never noticed that was added?
---
Yeah I need that nocturnal pipe pistol
---
Happens to me all the time. Almost every time I do it I end up tanking all pylons and I'm so busy trying not to die that by the time I manage to get a shot off on the fecker it's already dead. 
---
Tbh, these days it's pretty much the norm for any legendary enemy.  
---
That being said, I'm not gonna let it piss me off. I'd probably only be getting a crappy 1* anyway.  It's also quite rewarding knowing you're the reason the event completed successfully.
---
Bunker seems nice. Will play it casually, and not bother with progress much, though.
---
400 without stealth is absolutely enough to kill any ghoul type and some of the listed mobs you list. Power attacks with melee weapons does a lot of extra damage not counting the legendary effect you could get for it. 
---
Your also forgetting about the 75% armor pen which is massive. 
---
I can see it not one hitting super mutants but really 2 hitting is good enough. I’m sure it’s possible to one hit them with certain buffs like a 2 star  instigating with power attack legendary
---
Thank you for the suggestions!
---
I don't really need to look at Bandolier right now as I don't have thousands of bullets in my inventory at a time, but that will probably change when I reach higher levels.
---
I don't really like playing with randoms and I don't have any friends playing this game so I'd like to keep Lone Wanderer and leave Strange In Numbers, at least for now.
---
I really like the look of Sneak and Escape Artist, I sneak a lot so those should be very useful. Not really interested in having Mister Sandman over Covert Operative though.
---
Cool alternative for the Radicool card, didn't really know what to use so Fireproof could be useful. 
---
As for the level requirements, they don't really matter to me, this build is just the build I'm going to work towards, I won't have the full build for a while.
---
Really? Was instigating not additive by default? So only TS and AA would remain unchanged if that’s the case.
---
Personally I enjoy most of the cosmetics and camp items and btw it's military themed not BoS themed , Yea i can say some things dont really belong in the military aspect but there's some neat things like BoS bunker, Idk if it's a display but that power armor station looks neat plus some other metallic walls and floors. Personally it's good so far but the repetitive skins and same weapons getting skins is getting kinda bland
---
I mean yeah bullet sponge to solo but is there any evidence that it’s still a bullet sponge with a group of 8 people? Being serious because I don’t pay a whole lot of attention to the PTS but as far as the random colossus spawn right now people are able to take em down in groups and solo so I don’t think it will be a big deal with the nerf as long as people work together like the way it’s intended
---
There's a bunch of power armour perks in INT so it's pretty useful, in particular there is one that doubles your fusion core usage when maxed out (not just for power armour usage but for weapons that use fusion cores). There is one that causes your power armour condition to last longer but to be honest it lasts long enough as it is so I wouldn't worry about that one (though, there is one to reduce the amount of resources you need to repair power armour - THAT makes a huge difference. It miiiiight be the same perk? I can't remember). Anyway once you are higher level Watoga is great for power armour - if you do a circuit starting near the crashed veribird in the center of the city where power amour can spawn, heading west into the building with the woman who wants to fuck robots (there's a locked room in the back where power armour and fusion cores can spawn) then head up the medical building (where there's a potential fusion core spawn in one of the rooms) and a potential power armour on the rooftop then finally head over to the rooftop of the building opposite with a vertibird parked on it (you can either jump with marsupial/a jetpack or take the stairs outside the community building and cross the walkway) for a fourth possible power armour spawn. That's 4 possible spawns with I think either T45/T51/T60 pieces. One thing to note is the plans to make these armours are down to RNG in specific container types so I wouldn't expect to be able to get those any time soon so you are best off relying on finding the actual armour pieces themselves rather than finding the plans to make them. Ultracite power armour plans are pretty common in vendors, as it's a reward for the scorchbeast queen (I thiiiink?) so most people are selling it cheap. Oh and you should be a high enough level to go get the plans for the excavator armour by doing a quest down in the ash heap, it's pretty fucking great armour that'll last you a while. It's not the strongest for combat but it increases your carry capacity and is strong against radiation so it's pretty great general armour.
---
Hmmm....if only wisck was still in need of one.
---
I can't tell what they're trying to do but there's no incentive to actually play in a group. Join -&gt; get the % bonuses -&gt; return to your life as a hermit while vaguely aware there're others on the server.
---
I don't think one shotting ads is generally horrible to game design. Bosses yes but ads no. Especially when you rarely actually one shot them anyway thanks to all the bugs. Problem isn't the damage per se. Didnt the bethesda team use bloodied builds on the stream when fighting the colossus and they didn't seem to eat it alive?
---
And yes i know good weapons are broken when bloodied but the other side is that shit dps weapons are now decent too. Yes its stupid that one build is so much better than all the others but it actually makes my pistol build viable to play endgame content with. Instead of spending full clip headshotting every supermutant i encounter.
---
 I feel like this is the direction they should be taking other legendary effects instead of nerfing all damage while adding even beefier enemies.
---
 Need of team work through bullet sponge ads just doesn't seem very engaging and expecting anything beyond that from Bethesda seems unrealistic.
---
Then we should be allowed to kill you and loot your camp.
---
BOS is the militarized faction. They go hand in hand
---
Brotherhood doesn’t release until winter and there will be a new season in the winter. I feel like that whole season should be there’s not this one.
---
They should do this with other rare rewards.
---
There's so much unobtainable content in this game, and so little end game. It just makes sense!
---
I have crafted full sets on deep pocket lvl5 leather armor and dropped them for newbies. It makes me happy seeing them equip the gear before sending a heart emote my way and wandering off
---
As much as I would love to see a duper ragefest over their god-rolls becoming obsolete, I don't think the game balance is at a stable enough point to bother introducing higher level gear. There are so many issues among builds, within classes, among legendary effects, etc that extending another variable might just make things worse
---
I think changing the buffs to additive multipliers instead of multiplicatives is a good change, but right now is a mess. Thanks to this change most weapons are going to be useless and we are going to see even less weapon and build variety. For example melee, nobody will want to use melee after this change.
---
They should have revisited all weapons/perks and see if their damage should be tweaked to match better this new change, and actually rebalance all the weapons one by one so most weapons don't become useless after this change.
---
And One Wasteland isn't helping neither. Who thought it was a good idea nerfing everything, and if that wasn't enough, make all enemies harder. It only makes this problem worse.
---
Xbox is full of try hards.
---
Fixer Plans are a rare drop at the Encryptid Event. There are non-Legendary Fixers which you can find or will drop from enemies.  Legendary Fixers drop only if you have read the plan..  If you don't get the drop at Encryptid you may be able to find them for sale for about 15k.  May also be able to find a Legendary Fixer for sale in a vendor for about that. I paid 15k for the Plan and got very lucky when I next went to the Purveyor getting three Legendary fixer drops out of ten pulls.  Quad, Zealots and Mutant's explosive.  I've gotten three other Legendary  Fixers in about 200 levels since then.  Only one worth keeping, a Troubleshooters explosive which I use on silo runs. If you are on X Box i have a stalkers fixer for sale in my vendor for 5k.  IGN Draftiest Drop1.
---
A massive buff to all explosives they already weigh ridiculous amounts and require huge amounts of materials to make ammo for so why is everyone one of them useless
---
Season 1 lasts until September. Season 2 goes through December
---
Chinese are military too so your point?
---
my gaming triad has many fond and maddening memories of cracking the sometimes insidious puzzles, cipers and riddles in TSW. if you love that sort of stuff, I can't recommend it highly enough as well.
---
Lol its about the only platform its not on!
---
Bethesda does not do a very good job of teaching game mechanics
---
Don't beat yourself up about it. Sometimes we may not pay close attention to new or existing features.
---
I'm on PC but thanks for the offer and for the explanation!
---
Because I have nearly 1000 on my main character?
---
Winter starts in December
---
There wouldn’t be a BOS bunker if it had nothing to do with the brotherhood. From the beginning the plan was to roll out brotherhood w/season 2
---
Do you play on psn4?
---
*pulls out fatman.
---
Peace was never an option.
---
So far the very first encounter I found on that road was a scavenger wearing a clown hat lol. I have never, ever seen an NPC wearing one of those before.
---
I been getting it in Adventure a lot recently too
---
That sounds cool...
---
You could mix and match parts that don’t work well
---
If you server hop your bound to find a fresh server to complete the quest. Usually can chimes are the first to go on a server, server hop a can chimes spot when you hit a server that has its cans intact its prolly fresh lol
---
I think he just wanted to let us know.
---
If you are on a team, and a mate tags something, you can loot that enemy. I've been able to loot legendaries at Rad Rumble, even those times I was on ore collecting duty.
---
If so press double press share button. ( oval button on left above the joystick.
---
Nice post!
---
On the legendary perks I just want either a new card every 50 levels or the ability to rank up one you own. Get rid of the bullshit coin sytem. I wanr to keep my cards.
---
To clean up the ui just give us a hide option for cards we aren't using. Simple!!
---
This is not a needed nerf. The trade off is what makes bloodied builds fair. Why would I want to basically have no health for 25 extra damage. That is just dumb. I would be better just running vanguard with anti-armor.
---
Looks cool on the war rider one but not on the captain cosmos one
---
Wendigo colossus, and a few others are also this. Only at certain spots
---
I agree halfway with you. Yes this change is incomplete and requires more work but its good that they show they are working on it. And I also think they should have revisited some weapons like melee.  I think that build is the one suffering the most out of this change and it shouldnt be the case. 
---
I think they should keep this change and also buff many little thing in melee (among others) to make up for it.
---
Let's be honest here the brotherhood shouldn't even be here in the first place it's all just fan service at this point
---
This is the stealth/rifle build I used to use.
---

---
Bar in north ash heap
---
Puplic test server.
---
I mean, a nuclear war sure, but any roach caught in a blast radius is dead sauce 100%.
---
Brotherhood is going out when season 2 starts/during season 2. If that doesn’t happen it is because of a delay. It was all put on the PTS at the same time as well
---
It's like giving you least desirable type of weapons massively. While I used non automatic rifles, got so many plasmas, auto grenade launchers, broadsiders, fatmans etc. Not a single useful rifle in many many visits. Considering machine 150 scrip daily limit and some extra from quest rewards, it's set to looooooong grind to actually get lucky. I know you would eventually, couple already have, but do not make it main plan on gearing up. It's gamble like any other where probabilities are set in favor of junk.
---
Now when you tag junk, said junk despawns on interacting with it!
---
It's not a puzzle exactly, but there's a page in an open book in the Pioneer Day episode that you really should pause the show and read.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
It includes "Writing jokes for cartoons is more important than sleep" and that's the least funny gag.
---
glitch is still happening on xbl as of now.. fix or lose your integrity
---
Why not? At this point, I’m down to run a Nocturnal Shovel.
---
One of my friends gave me a handmade that does energy and ballistic damage, it’s explosive and shoots 5 bullets at a time and is so broken, I just put it on display in my camp, same with a weird WW2 weapon called the black knight that isn’t in the game yet, I don’t like using them so they are nice camp display items
---
Some late game ghouls have up to 2000hp those are rarer but 725-1000hp ones are common in late game and it's not unlikely to see the other variants more with enemys scaling to your level, just saying. And I don't know the exact damage multiplier for power attacks but I am not guessing it quadruples or even just doubles the damage, even with the legendary.
---
And your statement of "some of the listed mobs" is questionable for me too, I choose to add some with hp pools over 400, most of them are common late game like glowing version and such as well as some I know for sure can't even be one hit with \~700 or even 2k damage on hit in the game as it is currently (I don't only use unarmed either)
---
Exactly but it’s all about the $$$ now
---
Sheesh. People like you get things mixed up: Brotherhood of Steel Season is for Winter/Fractured Steel update.
---
You have to admit the rewards for Season 2 are 50× better than Season 1's.
---
I'm definitely going to place the Brotherhood bunker doors as my new camp doors and completely turn my camp into a full-on military bunker. I'm hyped for it.
---
Ha! The converter actually makes sense now. Only a raider could come up with a design so... Infuriating.
---
Stay away from it 😁
---
I don't really mind, they seem like fun weapons and there's no real PvP in this game.
---
I have full BOS UNY with all refresh for my bloodied commando build. I was just trying to get a UNY AP chest so I can attach the jet pack I bought. Alot of time and grinding to upgrade 1 piece at a time for a few extra DR, ER and RR lol
---
This seems baity to me. I play fallout and I have not seen any of what you are talking about. Please provide examples of such things happening if they are not being reported. Please explain why.
---
U can pop a rad x then a diluted one afterwards to still have your mutations
---
And I'm assuming it was fun, right?
---
Problem is that bloodied will still be the best damage dealers in the new meta (maybe TSE some are saying but who knows till live) all this really did was make everything significantly worse and make melee completely useless as they can't risk getting in close any longer as they don't do enough damage to down the new enemies, you've also made some ppls time investment a complete waste. they will need to reinvest in perks and weapon through trades or grinding to do damage at a reasonable level I say this as a high level junkies build not bloodied build so my fix will be pretty easy and hopefully legendary perks will make it easier
---
This why I left PC and went to Xbox, it was a problem in every game I played. Ingame economies being ruined by hacked  and duped items. On consoles you only have to deal with duping, I feel when consoles start bridging the gap in power and graphics more people will see that a closed platform is a lot better for online competitive gaming.
---
Very valid but I’m sure they will put a really dope bunker in the store. My whole point to this post is basically I’m not excited whatsoever
---
I'd like to think they are working on it, but at this point I can't trust in Bethesda anymore.
---
Wouldn't surprise me if they leave it the way it is right now and make this change live without tweaking anything else.
---
Looks cool on the war rider one but not on the captain cosmos
---
I couldn't have said it better myself.
---
Thats because pre nerf bloodied has many tiers above junkies comparing damage so this nerf brings bloodied just a few tiers above junkies now.
---
Lode baring is a good event to play them at.
---
I'm cool with not even keeping it. No offense to the folks who like it, but it all looks awful to me.
---
Maybe dark cptn cosmos?
---
That’s awesome! I love that
---
They’re ‘pay-for-advantage’ for anyone that’s not planning properly.
---
Weapon Artisan 3 and a spare secondary weapon on your quick wheel will avoid the need to use a Repair Kit on your weapon. 
---
High enough effective Intelligence when crafting your Secret Service Armor along with Buttressed mod will give you more DR and durability than you need, and if a piece breaks, leave it equipped to keep your legendary effects. Then simply go Fix It Good at your next opportunity. 
---
I’ve never needed to use a Repair Kit. I only keep two on me for the possible situation of being over-encumbered and needing to repair my PA legs. And that’s yet to happen.
---
I should give it a try still need 9 more slots though
---
hey, ive seen you in game before. this is cool
---
Would if I could find any ones besides nuka taper and Grognak.
---
The issue is the nerf combined with "One Wasteland". Which is just lazy as fuck.
---
Mining helmet. Not hat
---
Get with the program(literally) Bethesda.
---
That is half the fun. Also, with the perk loadouts, you can change it easier on the fly in the near future. As well as possible legendary perks that might help. I'm not concerned about it.
---
Or have robot races like the Easy city downs in fo4.
---
Just ultracite ores
---
Why was I upvoted??
---
&gt;I dont get it, people are never happy.
---
No, it's just that the a angry people are usually the ones shouting.
---
Thanks for the comment. I’ve done those things in the past but never encountered this bug until today, and didn’t do either of the above in this case. I was playing “during” the update so I watched my dailies switch (which I’ve also done before but again never had any issues), but I guess that could’ve been a contributing factor... even if that is the case it’s still ridiculous that the score system is so buggy, and it shouldn’t be up to the player to play a certain way just so it works as intended.
---
If I'm in an area where there's lots of radiation and I can't avoid it I'll just use a radaway without really much concern for bloody damage. You do plenty of damage still and since I have the healing factor mutation normal radaway removes less than usual. I also have level 3 Leadbelly which helps control radiation gain from food.
---
Stings and things is repeatable, finish it and server hop until u dont get it till next day, I get 2 badges daily from this quest alone
---
Things like this are why there is a PTS and why it should be kept to a controlled and have an NDA.
---
What happens in the games I play and my own head cannon are often bot the same.
---
The nerf was needed for the game future.... if everyone is 1 shotting thing then what the point?  This nerf was needed and it the right directions for the game
---
Where are all these beautiful Halloweenish things Ive seen?? 
---
Someone had a fog machine that had bats (WANT). She had her camp extremely creepy and Halloweenie, and aside from the odd thing here or there, I can't find this stuff anywhere!
---
The ones I said some to were the cave crickets, ghouls, gulpers and robobrain. 
---
Though a lvl 100 robo brain would be questionable. Gulpers are mostly glowing so glow sights would kill them no problem.
---
Agreed. Legendary weapons with the explosive perks are great, but weapons that are actually explosive without a legendary explosive effect are garbage
---
Def keeps you on your toes. And the weapons of the wasteland mod (that selectively adds in some less location locked weapons like thompsons and Shoulder Mounted Machineguns to the groups) also helps diversify things. Always nice running into super mutants with Automatic Rifles (Dead Money) or stumbling on Enclave packing Shoulder Mounted Machineguns (Lonesome Road) or even something as simple as a Talon group packing .45 Autos and Thompsons (Honest Hearts).
---
Probably nothing. It looks like it’s just another show that seems to be the Fallout universe’s version of G.I. Joe. 
---
That one character basically looks like a Communist-themed version of Cobra Commander.
---
I wouldnt say that just yet. I'm sure they will figure a way to access stash soon enough. Your best turning off vending again until later.
---
are you on the PTS too?
---
One Enclave, One America!
---
You edited your comment so let me add to what you added, the armor pen is not a factor here as it won't increase the damage over what it would do but just negate the effectiveness of resistance and my list was based on hp, adding the stealth multiplier you edited in will help loads as I said in the original post as well, so that's nothing to get at me for, it won't shrink as much has you might expect though the ones that fall out then are super mutants and cave crickets as well as some more types of ghoul and yes I do agree that two hitting is not a bad thing but I need to say that instigating won't do much more than bloodied. And I'd still like to know what was used to get to a base of 400 on the PTS
---
What about the west half of the map? I'm really worried that the enemies will scale up and I won't be able to relax in the first anymore.
---
Given how massive the potential legendary loot pool is for a 3* enemy, and getting something even decent for your build is so difficult, I do not think it should be restricted.
---
Knxsct320 is my psn.
---
I hear ya. I'm on PS4 and its steadily gotten worse for me since seasons started. I tried reinstalling and a few other thing but nope. Its downright unplayable now. I just uninstalled it and moved on to something else.i still have fun with fo4 though
---
Fallout 4’s explosive weapons put 76’s to shame.
---
Ok cool.  Thank you for the thoughtful and insightful response.  I’m genuinely curious as to how pricing is worked out, and my casual noodling with the pricing tool was by no means exhaustive.
---
I’m guessing the pricing is more accurate with multiple stars and more desirable weapons/effects?  
---
I truly think you have a wonderful site, and all of my questions/concerns are purely intended to be helpful and constructive.  I wish you nothing but success in the future.
---
Hey, I hope my comment did not come off as me being an a-hole. I am just an expert at getting drunk and doing stupid things so accidentally kicking myself out of my own steam sounds like something I would do :)
---
The beauty of public teams is you're not really playing with them.  Sure they can see you and your camp on the map but public teams don't allow team members to modify your base  and in my experience most people joining a public team are not there to play as a team.  They're there, much like myself who also doesn't play well with others, to get the additional bonuses while continuing to play solo.  A building team with 4 members gives an additional 4 int which I believe equates to an extra 8% XP for everything.  
---
If you're really not intending to use public teams then fair enough but I've got 2k+ hours in this game and up until public teams were introduced I never teamed up, always solo. Now, the first thing I do when I join a world is join an existing building team or start my own.  
---
FYI, one of my characters is a junky sneak rifleman. I can literally walk past anything and as long as I don't touch any enemies it's like I'm invisible.  Really fun build, I can one shot most things but I  won't be soloing the SBQ anytime soon but it doesn't take long to get the damage needed to loot her.  After that I just take care of the adds for the additional xp.
---
No! We don't need more currency. Also upgrading gear feels like crap. I'd much rather work towards new pieces maybe even gear sets.
---
For sure they will always put something interesting in the shop. Some season rewards also. 
---
The artificial "pressure" to finish the season some players feel, because they think they'll miss out on something unique that's never returning back is pointless. 
---
Smart tactic on Beth side, though.
---
You do have a chance to kill me, that split second after I initiate pvp with you, that first bullet doesn't do full damage, but by the 3rd bullet or 2nd melee you're already dead.
---
Yeah it’s worse than I remember. I was one step away from completing 2 quests. Had to restart the quests but all my ammo and aid i used of course is not back. Will never understand it. I just hope one day this game is as good as it should be. Overall it’s an amazing game just so many server issues. I was hoping private servers would be better but it’s not. It sucks lol
---
Hangin—balls(double dash)
---
Yeah glowing gulpers still have 1800hp and so even with the glow sights perk you won't one hit if it's additive but two or three hit and yeah as you said with some enemys it's questionable because of the increased level but I don't have hp info on those ones it's what I am most worried about.
---
This is why I have a jetpack on my SS armor
---
this! there is the mining hemet and the mining hat. the hat cant be modified, the helmet can.
---
I agree, they're all kinda bland
---
I don't understand why people don't look here before posting
---
Now every enemy is a bullet sponge though, so there’s no point in running low health anymore.
---
It’s definitely too easy to purchase. I’ve fallen into the trap as well. 
---
Now you can shake yo fist in anger tho
---
On pts instigating would help a lot more then bloodied in the initial hit.
---
Instigating doubles the damage the mob receives. However with buffs now being additive blooded does not truly double the damage anymore. You could get up to 200%~ with not using a bloodied weapon. ( adrenal and what not )
---
So making it 300% with bloodied would only increase damage roughly 33%
---
Bro I realized this at lvl15 lol I feel bad for you at lvl425... so what you did after lvl150? Lol
---
There was a video where someone detonated like 1000 nukes and his game crashed lol
---
Lamp projects for me fine. It may be bugged on certain platforms.
---
Bloodied is high risk high reward, now it’s only high risk low reward.
---
Intelligence is great for power armor, and I’d also put points in strength for heavy weapon perks. Personally I don’t give a fuck about builds because I just love exploring and big guns but if you’re looking for builds idk much about that.
---
It runs smooth on ps4 pro
---
Nice job dude. That's great
---
I do like all the time, if I've done all my dailies and all thats going on are events that last too long or I just need to calm down or let a disease expire I just sit at my terminal and fire up waste lad or Ruby ruins and zone out. Other than that I also really like nuka tapper, red menace is good but I'm pretty terrible at it same with missile command but somehow even worse.
---
My best current Fixer is an Instigating Explosive, but I've seen folks around with Bloodied Explosive. Coupled with Marsupial and VATS, any Fixer is a powerful combo for ranged sniping, but some of the legendaries take it to a whole other level.
---
Why don't devs just forget about balancing the game?  make it a sandbox with butt load of hacked items since pvp is ruined by the lack of it already. Totally the way to approach it
---
So I guess there is no nda now.
---
To be honest, those are solid choices at least.
---
I second this.. 
---
I’ve been playing games with their engine since morrowind. morrowind, oblivion, f3, fnv, skyrim, f4... I know a thing or two, but they are really bad at teaching players their mechanics. 
---
I can feel the diffculty of someone starting f76 as their first beth game.
---
I would consider a changeover to .38 for increased ammo abundance and decreased ammo weight.
---
I think that I speak for a nice amount of people when I say that the only reason we're still playing this game is because we enjoy the feeling or sensation you get for one shoting a Deathclaw or something big. I think this is an attempt at somewhat stabilizing the economy, because not that many weapons will still have the power necessary to drop a scorchbeast out of the air in a split second. And the ones that can will continue to grow in value, especially  legacies. And it they go through with this nerf, then make the fucking ammo converter easier to navigate, because I get a fucking headache everytime i look at it!
---
Sounds appropriate
---
I mean, you're absolutely right 😂😂😂😂
---
Make me think if I should make a 2nd character and lvl it too lvl50 blank spec since the legendary perk’s coins are account wide
---
I'm not a fan of that kind of rpg and played it a few times in fo4 just to test out the other characters.
---
I really like the Assaultron game.
---
The point is that all of the best gear in this game is gained completely randomly as a drop from literally any legendary enemy in any location.
---
Imagine if you could get to max item level in wow by randomly walking around the open world and killing enemies.
---
Okay so some effects still do still apply multiplicative? That's interesting I thought they had changed everything to be additive, that might be something to look into when this goes live.
---
It's still uncertain though with the hp increases. And my main "problem" of unarmed just being hit disproportionately still is true as stronger options were hit less hard.
---
I am just hoping that unarmed stays viable enough that I don't need to switch to something else, thanks for the info and discussion
---
Haha, yes! I don’t get why people are obsessed with this bloodied min-maxing.
---
Agreed.  Nothing but shite, in exchange for nerfed atoms.
---
Chinese Stealth Armor and radshields
---
Thinking more about this, it could just be the change to other buffs.  I have a bloodied build, so there's the Adrenal Reaction mutation, Nerd Rage, etc., and I was playing with all 9 ranks of Rifleman.  Perhaps this stuff was all switched to additive stacking as well; that would make a lot of sense.
---
What i'm concerned about is that with enemies now becoming bullet sponges, that there will be issues with running out of bullets. Needing to make more bullets means more grinding to get materials to make them. I hate grinding and spending most of my time to go material hunting for basic necessities. From what i've seen there are no adjustments towards that problem. I completely understand that they want lower levels to be able to play with higher level, and it's a good concept, but i don't know if they really thought about the repercussions. And if they did, they need to stop focussing on having us grind so much.
---
They will scale up, but I personally didn’t find anything to be particularly difficult.  I’m guessing the days of no build and/or no specialization in a weapon system are numbered, or ammo expenditure will increase for unoptimized builds.
---
The PTS is there for feedback and testing, and it just opened up yesterday.  I wouldn’t be overly concerned, because some adjustments will certainly be made over the coming weeks.
---
I never played so the comparison is lost on me
---
100% agree. I have a Daisycutter sitting on a rack not because I don't love using mininukes, but because I'm generally more likely to 1-hit something with my rifle.
---
Thank you for the detailed farming route, ill definitely come back to it when the time comes :)
---
I just pop constant diluted rad-aways. I don’t use radx as it suppresses my mutations. So if I absolutely need or want to go somewhere with high rads I bring my set of excavator power armor.
---
Edit: I always have serendipity active. It is extremely important.
---
Already been solved but it’s fantastic that you took the time to de-cypher it regardless! Congrats man *pops champagne*
---
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAH.
---
You funny.
---
It already happens with quest and event items sometimes, it's what makes this plausible!
---
If they're in there tinkering with explosives, they need to embiggen the Nuka Quantum Grenade's blast radius. I run Grenadier and actually use grenades, Quantums are... pathetic, makes me really miss the ones from FO3.
---
They drop but not with legendary effects. I have had a few. They aren't a viable weapons.
---
but only one is actually interesting. the crstalizing barrel of something like that. instead of a cloud of freezing gas it make the cruolator shoots small crystalizing balls. it greatly increases its range and adds some energy damage.
---
the other is a stock for less recoil and a holo sight for increased accuracy. 
---
nothing great.
---
Awesome, thanks for the suggestion. Ill definitely be getting the Excavator armor because thats the same quest that rewards the power armor station plan i mentioned above.  Also really appreciate the detailed explanation, on the difference in armors.
---
Will Cyberpunk have multiplayer?
---
And maybe a quest line to unlock gambling themed weapons. A broken beer bottle, a gold 6 shooter, an automatic weapon that shoots poker chips, and dare I say to get a little too fantasy on you, an end game level throwing weapon of bladed playing cards that deals stupid bleeding and limb damage. 
---
I... just really want good throwing weapons.
---
Yeah I ended up getting fallout first due to bad experience with the legendaries at one violent night with an op Tesla gun or build clearing the group in and night stalker before we tagged it, then same on the Brahmin herding event ended up buying fo1st
---
The Halloween vending machine is currently on sale today in the atomic shop. I don't know if you have it or not.
---
What do they drop from anything specific
---
Agreed, typically games make ammo weigh a lot if it’s strong but Fatman and Missile Launcher are so pitiful everyone dumps it on sight.
---
Ooh! What are the other CAMP items, if you don’t mind sharing?
---
Not on mine.
---
Easy there satan...
---
Is there a plan for doing a melee comparison?
---
Except that would mean every enemy in WoW was end game content once you hit that level. In WoW, trash mobs quickly become exactly that. and non-endgame zones become the exact same as what happened in 76, nobody goes there except to farm specific things. One Wasteland is changing that. That's the point
---
Same :) to tell you the truth unarmed is truly a beast in live version. There are people who can get up to 5k to 10k damage and that is just way too much. I myself who is not speced toward melee anymore still do 2k with my claw.
---
If they do go though with this I hope they consider to increase base dmg on some of these weapons.
---
I counted 6 Arktos lab coats in my inventory afterwards.  Thanks, RNG gods!  lol
---
They also need to get rid of item levels. Just have them automatically adjust to whatever level you have access to.
---
I traded for a QE LVC today. Wanted to mod it out and see what it can do. 
---
It's been a hoot.
---
I get this too. Usually I switch to 1st person and click aim down sights again. Thay usually fixes it
---
But damn annoying
---
I pop them in when I'm holding down workshops, keeps me from checking the extractors every four seconds.
---
Ive considered running a second character eventually just to see the fun, now nevermind xD
---
I do hope pistols get a big buff then i can make a lone ranger character
---
This is a good idea but I can imagine how trying to run script over all inventories would have unintended consequences. Also it doesn't fixed duped items, just hacked ones. Still good start
---
Cool, don't care. Idiots like you are why this fucking world sucks dick, go back to your fucking trash filled basement little pig.
---
It may not function the same if the player is using the Stabilized perk. I say "may" because I am not familiar with the damage calculations. But there's potential for stacking.
---
What we really need is something to avoid this bullshit RNG. I am all for meta change, as long as we have reliable methods of getting good armor and weapons.
---
Two options.
---
1- Allow us to change the legendary affixes in some way. Limiting the changes to one star or something, to still invest time and resources in getting good things.
---
2- Allow us to craft all of the weapons and armor via legendary modules. Balance the quantity of legendary modules and the price of mmurgh to make the random pick still attractive.
---
That's it.
---
The institute hasn’t been created yet
---
You can find them randomly in Helvetia
---
Obvious I'm getting nowhere with you.
---
You mean the rebalance thing? It’s called one wasteland, not one appalachia
---
Ooh, that could be fun! I’ve heard the Tankkiller perk is supposed to impact pistols after the next update.
---
That’s... the point of them
---
Oh no, but I remember this name from game.
---
Looks about right
---
Hopefully with the damage nerf, everyone will get a chance to tag it before it dies.
---
Yeah that's a plus! I want more attachments for the magnum tho BLAH
---
Still can't get passed it and it's been days. I think we should get some sort of apology gift.
---
yeah in the museum
---
I've had them as rare random drops. They are terrible weapons with with no redeeming features - the power of a good shotgun, but the range of a bad shotgun but with no mods to improve it. Very much a novelty item for the collectors.
---
Do you people just not.. Explore your menus and keybinds and such? I don't get how these things happen, not knocking or anything, just surprised.
---
This has to be an exaggeration.
---
*Please* say it’s an exaggeration, like I know in FO4 the Fat Man felt so much less potent than NV, but I need to know the biggest thing it can kill consistently.
---
I take a low dmg tesla rifle and spam shoot the ground. It be better if I rolled a 90% reduced weight tesla rifle because I don’t even use it in any other situation.
---
Would melee bloodied still work? I'm not going in there anyways as bloodied cause I don't do bloodied PA and wouldn't last a second in a nuked zone for more than 15 minutes without power armor. 
---
I'm mostly just asking how bad the melee nerfs are in the update, sure I don't like one shotting everything, but the scorchbeast queen basically ignores dodgy and serindipity so I die in one hit and doing any less than 100 damage to that boss would be so demoralizing, let alone to a boss I've never fought before like Colossus.
---
And how much bullets are we talking exactly? Could you give me a rough estimate of how much you spent?
---
My point exactly, you wont ever see it because you wont even start to consider it.
---
nice gun! get the crystalizing barrel mod. I hve a non legacy a J1090. not a good weapon at all, but works great as support for iss and sbq.
---
You could remove a few perks to challenge yourself. Just saying you always had the option. Nobody forced you to play op. You chose it. Choice is good in games. Taking choices away from players is not good. They could've buffed other builds to level the playing field and then worked from there. This... luckily it's just on the PTS right now. Hopefully they use the feedback they get and make a few changes to this. I guess we'll see.
---
They've already decided how it's going to work
---
I actually had one drop as a legendary the other day. Nocturnal. A useless weapon to start with, sort of a shotgun in use.,
---
With the damage nerf, hopefully everyone will get to tag it. No more one shooting will actually have benefits.
---
You need to take a photograph when he is doing that creepy smile of his.
---
Got Uny on the 2nd chest. Just luck of the draw.
---
If RNG doesn't go your way, blame the desire sensor. The more you want it, the lower your chance.
---
I had one drop from a glowing honey beast
---
It worked
---
Fast travel cancelling ain't a thing in the Atom Shop that's for sure!
---
Thank god, I’m stuck at 23 right now because everywhere I go I have level 70 mobs one-shotting me, and then players also decide it’s funny to one shot me lol
---
How is it lazy? Technically speaking it’s pretty complex. I’m not a fan of one wasteland but curious what you mean by that.
---
Man, you know what? Now Fallout 76 voices work perfectly!
---
What I did, was that I moved all sound folders from Fallout 76 data, to different location, then just Fallout 76 &gt; properties &gt; verify integrity of game files.
---
On both arms and chest two rolls each I got 3 star unyielding but for the legs I swear it took 80 rolls each. I would like a couple better prefixes but after that I will not craft another piece. I use it on weapons from purveyor now
---
The enclave aren’t techno fascists like the bos, they’re actual fascists lol
---
Nocturnal 25ffr 15reload fixer.
