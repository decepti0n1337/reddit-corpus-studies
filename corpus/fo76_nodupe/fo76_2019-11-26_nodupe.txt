You really are trying hard aren't you?
---
---
---
If you mean physical (hardware) server dedicated to a world? Very unlikely. If you mean virtual server (VM) dedicated to a world? Probable. But, why do you think it matters?
---
Yeah, nukashine. I'd put toxic water in it if it would let me tho
---
I'll believe it when I see it. And even then I'll be skeptical.
---
likewise tomorrow is day 4 so I'm screwed if I don't get a reply.
---
Yes.  You have an instance that contains the game.  There are no servers that contain one instance of the game, they're all virtual and non-permanent.  The difference is public ones have 24 players and anyone can join, 'private' ones have 8 players and you control who can get in.  Otherwise there are no differences to speak of.
---
I suppose that change is definitely subjective from person to person, i like the wheel mostly because it made room on the Dpad for the quick weapon swap and quick stimpack buttons and the wheel can have things swapped in and out of it while accessing it instead of having to swap it out from the pipboy, however that change isn‚Äôt needed for 4 as opening the pipboy pauses the game
---
How about just using the helmet lamp?
---
This strategy worked for me. I now have all the plans. Ty.
---
I've been playing since beta and logging on now as I type this. Personally I enjoy it a lot.
---
yeah, you been locked up in vault 76 for too long
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning
---
On a power armor helmet? Im talking about if you're lower level and have every other power armor piece except a helmet
---
Shut up
---
It is a fun and worthwhile game. It definitely has it moments that test your patience,  but I have been playing since BETA and still load up FO76 at least every other day. It is really what you make out of it and the reddit here is a great resource.  Vending and trading raises the game take in a whole new level. Try it an make the decision for yourself.  Cheers.
---
Playing on a one X it isn't so bad now, no different to fallout 4 in terms of bugs personally for me.
---

---
The one thing I HATE is the levels of the enemies though. It's super frustrating having someone higher level make the mobs super difficult randomly. One time you can do a quest fighting level 3 feral ghouls, the next it's something entirely different that you don't stand a chance against
---
LMAO. This was me last night. Decided to go back to Fallout 4 for a bit for the first time in like 6 months. And my god it had me all messed up, I didn't set up my controls in 76 as the same as 4 so kept pressing the wrong buttons and when VATS slowed down itconfused me at first plus the amount of junk that I couldn't break down. Weight not being a major issue I laughed when I found i had 556 stimpaks, 300 radaways, 180 fusion cores.
---
And to top it off I'm so used to either solo or with my friends in 76 that I completely forgot about the companions.... Wondered why McCready was following me around lol.
---
You are entitled to be wrong, FO4 is amazing. Playing bad has ruined your opinion into thinking FO4 is bad.  You are just wrong.
---
Should be 20 hours between spawns by character. I'm not sure what the actual spawn rate is for in world objects. Sometimes you can relog with another character, and collect the spawns at the same location.
---
Thank you for your invaluable opinion.
---
Throw this on top of it then. The more the better
---
They sure do.  I recently finished off the last of my magazine challenges on a private server.
---
My character changed clothes and got a haircut.
---
This is probably the sort of content you've been waiting for, I know.
---
I don't know if your on a console or PC but. In PS4/Xbox I miss the D-pad for favorites. And changing where the default stim pack  button is was just mean.
---
Hey man, be careful what you wish for. There are multiple ways to grief someone without killing them. Imaging finding one of the rare vendors, only to have someone sit there, preventing anyone else from accessing the vendor. Imagine dying unexpectedly, and having someone steal all of your loot. Imagine people preventing you from completing certain limited time special events.
---
In general, being immune from damage caused by other players is a good thing, but granting immortality to everyone? That can be abused, very easily. There's an argument to be made that selective, universal godmode is a horrible idea. Sometimes you need to be able to put an end to someone who has bad intent in his heart.
---
Thanks bud, been lurking the sub for awhile now seems very divided but thanks for the motivation. Ill probably check it out next payday
---
Cant make it feel like 76.totally different type of fallout.
---
Yeah.  What exactly are the Stars in a critter measuring if not loot level?  They all get 1 Regen, and don't seem to hit any harder.
---
Tried it out, I'm liking it a lot that the weapon cycles so fast. Comes in very handy if you're in a firefight and running low.
---
Needed to make some tweaks to solve the weight issues and toss a few bits into the stash, but going with this for now. Unlike your approach, I favour using PA and as I have 485 fusion/ultacite fusion cores stashed away, they'd weigh over 1450lbs if it wasn't for Batteries Included. (I have so many of them because I loot them wherever I see them and with only 1 exception to date, I never sell or trade them, alongside a little help from the super duper/ammosmith perks where the ultracite ones are concerned)

It's nuts how much of an impulse it is to just tap that button every once in a while as you travel through the world. I only notice that I do it when I try to play another game. Borderlands 3 took a lot of getting used to haha
---
This is pretty cool. My girlfriend and I sometimes drink NukaShine and let it take us where it may. We travel naked and without weapons, (or chems) only allowing ourselves to use what we find as we make our way to meet up at an agreed place that is halfway between our NukaShine spawn points. From there we travel together to one of our camps (whichever is the furthest away).
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs all RNG. What a three star enemy means is that you can get UP TO a three star weapon, but you can also get 1 or 2 star weapons
---
I sent you a request. Did you accept ?ill show you I can tank a full tesla clip.many real PvP builds can.including my team.
---
FINALLY! Thank you for letting me know
---
Yeah 76 has the best exploration and world out of any fallout game
---
That‚Äôs fucked up man.
---
I definitely feel this too. I've actually been playing a ton of Fallout 4 lately, just cause I had an itch for it, and it took a while to get used to not scrapping at random workbenches, not being able to craft my own weapons, not to mention all the menues pausing the game. It's certainly a more sedate experience in some ways. 
---
I also miss the Holos tab in the pip-boy. I still want them to go back to how things were before, with notes organized in the order you got them, but the separate tabs for holotapes was definitely nice.
---
Ok Zoomer
---
Honestly it kinda was frustrating to fill scorchbeast Queen and get a 1* nocturnal pistol üòÇ. I‚Äôm kinda used to it now
---
it feels the saw for every fallout game to me i was debating on making a post earlier but this post fully embodies it for me
---
That also keeps like high value weapons valuable though because if every 3 star enemy dropped a 3 star weapon, then more of these valuable rifles and melees with be worth substantially less bc more people would get them
---
Lever unless looking for high dps, go with an automatic handmade for that.
---
So are pumpkin grenades good for this?
---
Asking for a friend.
---
This is a problem, for sure. I don't notice it anymore because all my characters are around lvl. 100.
---
But I remember the first time I went in to belching Betty, I was dealing with lvl. 15-28 scorched. It was tough, but I was strategic and made it through all right.
---
Second playthrough, I was like "yeah this will be nothing". Oh what's this? Some high level had just run through there and the scorched were lvl. 40-60? Aw hell no, after the first attempt and quick death, I server hopped til they were a manageable level.
---
There's not much to come back to right now. You're best off waiting for several more months until the Wastelander's DLC drops.
---
Switch to commando.
---
But this isn't war, it's a game so a better comparison would be sports. Competitive gaming is called esports not ewars after all, sports have rules to be fair. Heck, even war has rules, look up Geneva Conventions.
---
Probably, but it was 1 cap per so i think is good
---
Fallout 76 is not a traditional RPG. You can‚Äôt go into it expecting it to be one.  
---
I enjoy it on PS4, I did play BETA on PC but switch to where more of my friends were.  I enjoy the game.  There is a story, but it‚Äôs more like a archeological dig than what you might see in other games.  You learn what happened to the world through bits and pieces of lore, holotapes, and terminals...but (and for now, things change with Wasterlanders next year) that‚Äôs it - unlike other games that truly had NPCs. 
---
But if you treat this game more like a survival game with roleplaying elements, it can be really enjoyable.   It‚Äôs the cycle of go to a location, pick up loot looking specifically for legendaries or plans to make better gear than what you have, or to upgrade your camp to make it look cooler (or be better defended), all with the ‚Äúend game‚Äù of doing a few of the harder events - either solo or in a group.  In this way it‚Äôs more like other survival games out there that don‚Äôt have an overarching story. 
---
So if you can get it cheap enough, its worth a try in my opinon.
---
Here's the clue: assemble a supercritical mass i the shortest time possible..
---
Or, as the HHGTTG had it: Keep banging those rocks together.
---
Happened to me last week, I reported it (through the form) - was using Firefox too.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Definitely something on their end.
---
Thanks!
---
&gt;  so I must really be missing an important area. 
---
Yeah... the area of internet BS is sorely lacking in your posts.  In the 200's is about right.
---
&gt; I had pacifist on so he couldn't do any real damage
---
You are going to get so badly burned one day if you misunderstand basic FO76 gameplay principles.
---
Pacifist mode has *no* effect on incoming damage, it only stops *you* damaging others.
---
Be lever action will give u that sniper: one shot one kill vibe. Assault is decent. If going commando - handmade FTW
---
I reinstalled Fallout 4 this weekend after playing 76 because I want to be able to pause my game.  Tried to create a new character on Survival mode but it does not feel the same as 76.  Ended up just going back to 76.
---
It would be great if they implemented the crafting and inventory UI into 4 , feels weird not seeing colour lol
---
I add whatever booze I have sitting around. As for drinking random things at camps, I have been quoted a few times with my friends as randomly shouting "it's a trap" after drinking something at a camp, right as I teleport away. xD
---
The critical meter fills 15% faster. Critical meter fills fills after each shot (when it works correctky.  The base cretical meter fill amount is influence by LCK.
---
Stars reflect the max amount of stars an enemy could drop.
---
#soloplayer hard to regularly find the nuked mats
---
Twice in a row i got stalker‚Äôs pool cue from the queen. This game redefined the word ‚Äòshitty‚Äô üëå
---
You can't.
---
Stingwing barb already does not auto scrap.
---
If they want to stop texture/mesh replacer mods there are ways they can easily do that, but they haven't. 
---
They stopped the engine from loading additional plugins, and have been banning people for attempting to use things like cheat engine (which they apparently have set up detection for) to get around that, so if they wanted people to not be able to load archives as well, they could do that. Same goes for the script extender that runs a lot of the UI mods.
---
If they chose to go straight to bans without first disabling the loading of additional archives and making a clear statement that no modding will be tolerated... well it wouldn't go over well. They would lose a lot of the PC players. Simply stating "we don't support modding" isn't the same at all as saying "we don't want anyone modding this game at all" and they know that.
---
Lever is better than the assault rifle for a rifleman build.  Lever is better than anything else for a rifleman build. 
---
Assault rifle if you want to run commando.  But the Handmade or Fixer are better options for autos.
---
A lot of the gameplay and survival mechanics remind me of the fallout 4 horizon mod overhaul.
---
I get what your saying, but theres so many possibilities for 3 star variations that those "rare weapons" are still rare. There was a video on the legendary system and you had like a 1:500,000 chance of getting the 3star you wanted. Counting the fact that a 3 star could drop any number of items, if anything at all
---
2k of materials makes 10k ammo. It's only hard once.
---
Did you get the event reward (usually a two star armor)?
---
It was never bad.  It had bugs, as all bethesda games do, but it was never a bad game, it was a buggy game. 
---
Most of the bugs have been fixed at this point.  
---
So yes, Fallout 76 is still good now.
---
Alright, so based on say a 10 luck which is normally 20% per hit, it's 15% more than that , not an additional 15% to make it 35%?
---
A random collection of my drinks, with a slight bias to nukashine. You only get to live once (with a few respawns)
---
You can buy mutation serums from players for 100-400 caps.
---
She absolutely is. She lands much more often in my experience when doing her solo because only you have her aggro. Maximize your damage output via perks/weapon mods (prime), have some chems, and having a bobblehead for the type of weapon you're using helps a lot. Shoot her in the face and she'll go down fairly quickly since her DR isn't boosted by having other players around. A good build can kill her before the mirelurk kings/queens spawn.
---
I found the number. Its 1:347,410. Probably higher now with the new legendaries. This was back before the sheep squash was added
---
1.2k hours on fo4 (mostly in survival), 700 on fo76 here.
---
What i dont miss from fo4:
---
- putting all your junk on the floor in a settlement to break it into components
---
- survival respawn timer (had to sleep for 83 days to reset cells, done it so many times)
---
- 1 star only legendaries
---
- deadly cars!! Oh god
---
What i miss:
---
- a true survival mode (the first 20 level were tough on fo4)
---
- the armor mod to move faster (i had one on each limb, greatly changed the pace)
---
- Multiple settlements and settlers
---
- piper, mac cready and valentine
---
- infinite storage
---
- knowing every bed location in the commonwealth
---
And so much more. Anyway, I didn t launch a fo4 since i ve bought 76 a year ago (yeeha), I think I will be disapointed.
---
It does feel too lonely but since I'm just filling up my scrap box it's nice not having to worry about places being picked over. 
---
I personally got it for the cosmetic, emotes and atoms (contemplating that communist bundle). I have already cancelled but I'll renew again when some other good items come out.
---
VATS is a holdover from when Fallout was an RPG series. The more gun play rather than stats oriented it becomes, the less VATS makes sense.
---
Will be there for Fallout 5 I suppose. In however many years that will be!
---
I do remember them saying in the NoClip documentary that a lot of the improvements they made to the engine and the gameplay build a base for fallout games in the future. Even people that don't like 76 should be glad it exists because it finally made them take out a lot of old code.
---
I had Nukasbine in mine, until I rebuilt my camp and it disappeared.
---
And, I do consume whatever is at other ppl's camps when I see the bowl.
---
Been happening to me too. Like ill get an armor piece or something as a notification but nothing else and no loot on the body.
---
sell enough things to buy your first serum recipe. (this could be buying serums low and selling high)
---
craft and sell that first serum to players and bots.  
---
repeat.
---
honestly, besides the occasional high-worth weapon/outfit/armor/plan drop from events; this is the easiest way to make caps with the lowest effort.
---
To be fair, rifles are pretty crap unless you go bloody.  I guess that could be said about almost any weapon, but stealth builds are typically very perk/gear intensive.  They can be very efficient, but you need to trim every last bit of fat to get results.  In my experience, only a gauntlet and sniper build are capable of taking out a sheepsquatch or scorchbeast in one shot.
---
Yes, have to close the application and reopen unfortunately.
---
My brain is not the best brain.
---
i was saying this exact same thing htis morning. 76 was my first fall out, and going back to try one called new vegas felt really weird. gonna muscle through tho since everyone talks about it.
---
You might want to re-examine your build if an explosive handmade only does 8 splash damage.  Mine is 50-80, depending on distance, and I use one rank of demo expert.
---
The desert ranger helmet was exactly the same as the NCR ranger helmet just a different texture
---
Thanks for the response, ive tried that 3 times, now turning ps4 power completely off
---
We don‚Äôt make problems, we just solve ‚Äòem.
---
Yea shooting a rocket, then out running it was fun
---
It really depends on how they implement this. I see it being just as frustrating even once they release it.
---
My Bowl is russian roulette. 
---
1 rum

1 whiskey

8 nukashine

May the odds be ever in your favor.
---
Explosive combat shotty with a 12 round mag and add a reflex sight
---
I hate to say without testing. Why do you want to know? Are you trying to get every other shot a critical?
---
It's decent. But just decent.
---
I'm not your buddy. I am just a person who is used to having to wait for more than an hour and a half or perhaps even 24 hours to get a reply for submitting a ticket for support for things much much larger than Fallout 76. The entitlement in the sub is real. God how I wish everyone in this sub worked retail or customer service for one week before crying about not getting response to their issue in less than 24 hours. You really do strike me as the type of person that would go to a city's most popular restaurant on a Saturday night and then demand to speak to the manager when you find out that they don't have an available table for you and you will have to wait 45 minutes for a seat.
---
Honestly, just walking down the roads is one of my favorite things in fallout games. You meet unique npcs, find new locations, and come across cool stuff. That‚Äôs why after all this time I still wander down the roads in New Vegas and 4.
---
Oh ok thanks
---
Oh wow, that‚Äôs a whole other level of bugged. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre experiencing that! If that doesn‚Äôt work, maybe a complete reinstall would fix it. Sorry man!
---
Like free items (ingame plans)?
---
Best atom shop items?
---
Or general ideas?
---
For a "first set" of level 50 armor, I'm gonna go out on a limb and recommend T-60. Primarily because it balances decent all around resistance and easy acquisition of mods (many BOS side missions and locations have mod plans) with the all out cheapest repair costs.   
---
Great for when you are between L50 and 100 and haven't built up a ton of scrap for expensive repairs.
---
Free ingame and general ideas
---
Always...its the only reason i buy them
---
Idk but there is a purvayor sale
---
Really strange, i ended up switching controllers and that did the trick. The first one worked fine to get me to that point, then wouldn't start the game, maybe the onscreen action of shutting one off then starting the other?
---
I mean, is not that the idea is bad or the other one is better, is just that the controls are so scuffed and doesn't respond as intended that it becomes mildly infuriating at times, while the one in 4 is simple and it works.
---
Weird! Possibly so. Who knows with how bugged everything is with this game... still love it though haha. Glad you got it fixed!
---
I hadn‚Äôt heard about that bug, but I feel vindicated now.  I thought the regen thing was new to fo76.  Guess I‚Äôll start looking for a new main weapon. 
---

---
The bookcase shelves look great put together in an L shape like a bar. I actually prefer it over the bar pack I purchased from the atom shop.
---
Ultracite armor plans (but not mods) just don't sell for whatever reason.  Pity because the ultracite jetpack can be used on *any* ultracite piece leaving your chest armor free for a different mod.
---
Kill your character. That solves this for me.
---
How hardcore of a fan are you? Are you able to overlook old, recurring, and new glitches and bugs? If you can answer moderate to the first question and most of the time to the second, try it out again. I‚Äôve been playing since beta and although there have been some growing pains, it‚Äôs overall been an enjoyable experience. And while you‚Äôll run into griefers, I think now more than ever you‚Äôll find a community happy to help new players out.
---
Is the brown asylum uniform worth anything?
---
you are welcome - I sell cheap all marine parts I found (usually 1 or 2 pee week)

Yeah man, I started like a week ago and I‚Äôm already level 81! I just wish I started sooner haha
---
Cool, thanks for the tip if you're on Xbox stop by ok?
---
It is on the 1st tab
---
You can buy more with 2 but less chance of something good.
---
Free items.
---
I'd try to get a bunch of the whitespring decor pieces. You should be able to get for cheaper from Reddit, as people should have a bunch of those plans from the Halloween event. (If you're going for a clean fancy bar)
---
If you're going for something more like a raider bar, then obviously dirty furniture is more fitting. Use random beaten up objects to create junk and clutter. Often you can turn objects the opposite way they are meant to face in order to repurpose them
---
If you place clean vault drawers next to each with the drawers facing in, you make quite a nice bar area, then just add stools Infront.
---
Pool tables, jukebox, cigarette machine all those kind of camp items that seemingly belong in a bar.
---
General ideas
---
All depends on what type of bar. It's definitely always nice to have a little performance area with instruments. If you're going for more that kind of dive bar feel, you could make fighting cage/pit for entertainment.
---
Atomic Shop
---
I'd say 2 best items for price and usefulness. Wood flooring (not sure if still there) and the new Thanksgiving display case. You can display 6 items, so you could have a couple behind the bar area and display all different alcohol (especially nukashine because it looks amazing) and maybe different Nuka colas (you get all the exotic 1s like grape, wild, orange from whitespring bar vendor)
---
Sorry what üòÇ I don‚Äôt need to hear your life story buddy, as you can see I still haven‚Äôt gotten any kind of response, which shouldn‚Äôt take more than an hour, for a game where most people have paid FULL PRICE OF ¬£60 for a triple A game, and whats with the whole entitlement essay, did I hit too close to home or something? üòÇ
---
[removed]
---
Yes and no.  Not everyone has superior FPS skills, or the ability to make a perfect headshot or limb target without taking the time to sit there and aim-down-sights.  VATS is still a crutch for that, and it's pretty close to what VATS actually *is* in the fiction of Falllout.
---
The first tab. You may have to reset your system to see it. There is also a skin for the outfit and the helmet.
---
Honestly I‚Äôve noticed that 2* legendary enemies seem to drop the best loot. Recently I gained a 2* executioner‚Äôs exploding handmade, a 2* bloodied FSS deathclaw gauntlet, and a 2* suppressor‚Äôs exploding western revolver. Then again I‚Äôve stopped praying to RNGesus and switched to Lootcifer so ymmv.
---
I feel like if you get scammed the person that scammed you should get a bounty
---
I play this late every day. It is a filthy wonderful game.
---
This is so lit and makes me want to buy this dogshit game that is 76. Kinda sad that this is what made me want the game but damn do I want it ü§£
---
Although I liked (most of ) your post I think it important to point out that this **rarely occurs**.  I play '76 *far* too often lately and I can tell you that I've got the nuke mine exploit once in maybe the last 500 hours of play (or more).  It didn't kill me.  I popped a rad-x and laughed at the guy as he threw more utterly useless nuke mines at me.  Eventually he went away.
---
Now I'm not running a bloodied build and I can see how this could affect bloodied builds more so than myself.  But I have a feeling that most experienced  bloodied builds have an emergency super stimpack and rad-away (or grape nuka) on their favorites and can mitigate any damage.
---
So yeah it happens.  Happened to me two weeks ago.  But it happens *rarely*.  Keep a radaway (and maybe a rad-x) on your favorites and you'll be fine
---
Yeah haha, so strange to adjust to a game that wasn‚Äôt made to be intentionally grindy to shill microtransactions
---
I check every vendor I can. That's where I got my torso, and lighter builds and such.
---
yeeeees lol

Thanks, is there a community for buying and selling plans?

FT to HF, cross the tracks (sneak into the small building to pick up a black powder pistol and rifle).  Look for the hole in the first building and look in every display case.  As soon as you get in the building, take a right into the second room.  Immediately to your left is the first display and directly ahead of you against the far wall, is the second.  Taking a left to the next room you will find a few displays, usually with vases in them.  Occasionally, the display immediately to your left has a plan.  Next head outside and turn right.  You're going to be using the boxcar to enter the second story.  Once inside the building, you'll see a small display.  Behind that and to the left against the far wall is another display that can sometimes spawn a marine wetsuit.  Go back to the stairs that you should have seen when you entered.  Go up to the third floor and you'll see a display with a box in it.  There's usually a recipe in it.  After that you want to walk towards the ramp that leads to the roof.  Instead of going up, walk over the wall to see another display case,directly under you. , with the last one at the back if the room.  ,
---
I have found plans in all of the large display cases.  If there tris nothing n any if those, server hop until you do find something.  IIfi they still don't spawn, then you'll have to wait for  the spawn.  If you do see a plan and it isn't what youant, server hop until it is. Marine armor usually spawns when Super Mutants also spawn.  But, you can find them regardless of enemy spawns.
---
Alternative, I find them often enough to have all 3 plans in my vendor.  Xbox gt same as this one.
---
Same it is really annoying.
---
Thank you!
---
I couldn't stand playing like that so I haven't played much. I guess I hadn't died with that guy since that started.
---
FPV is back and the bloody bones are gone. Phew.
---
It's still glitchy but not as bad, if you like the gameplay then definitely give it another try.
---
No problem! I tried everything I could think of before just blowing myself up and dammit that was it!
---
Me and yes.

The unfortunate reality is that these people **very rarely** get banned.  I've reported griefers before only to encounter them again some weeks later on.  Bethesda will *absolutely delete your report if you do not send them video of the event**.  The even send you an email for every report stating that is what they are going to do .  üòû
---
When you encounter the rare  griefer just block them and leave the world and you'll likely never be bothered again.

I‚Äôve walked from the Whitespring to Harper‚Äôs Ferry many times, and once from the Munitions Factory down to Fissure Prime.  There‚Äôs tons of random encounters along the way and a shocking amount of legendaries, surprisingly.
---
It‚Äôs also fun to find dozens of little unmarked ‚Äúsituations‚Äù scattered everywhere.  In the Mire, there‚Äôs a derelict shack in the woods that was clearly used in conjunction with the nearby medical specimen house.  I guess they were making their own supplies.
---
Yeah same, I tried fo4 today after not playing it since the release of fo76 and I was struggling with carry limit because of how I've gotten used to just scrapping it all the time
---
That's all I ever put in.  Lol, unsuspecting victims.
---
Same, TSE in the stash box and instigating ffr has completely taken over.

I think the biggest problem with bounties is everyone else can do full damage on you while you are wanted. If you become wanted you should be able to do full damage on other players (with the exception of pacifist people) but you are always flagged and cant see other people on your map. Bounty hunters will be able to see the wanted player on the map unless they are in sneak. If the wanted player is in sneak their exact location wont be revealed but a general area circle will be shown on map and on compass. I think this would be fun.

Unarmed melee is super fun and powerful, especially bloodied. Make sure you have the 2 melee mutations and the iron fist and Radicool perks, then you get ridiculous free armor from ironclad and barbarian. The unstoppable monster is a slightly cheaper bloodied swing speed deathclaw gauntlet and pair with any unyielding armor. The bloodied mutation with nerd rage and serendipity perks let you straight up dodge a ton of damage too.
---
Mutations I‚Äôll agree with, but the cap on workshop inventories, inability to sell certain items (like ammo), and no NPCs makes it a lesser successor.
---
What is it about power armor that makes it so bad for PvP?  Can you explain that one to me please?  The raw numbers would seem to indicate otherwise but experience bears it out.
---
I am a fallout first subscriber too and lost everything and never had anything replaced. I just went in my "Private World" and calmed a shit load of workshops and filled it so full, it is probably breaking a few servers. lol
---
I am only now adding guns to my arsenal and with some of the associated perks ( don't have them all yet)  I'm ripping apart those high level yao gui' near the bed and breakfast south of the white springs.  I have a TSE Prime 50 cal.
---
You can sell ultricite
---
Some people are just wasting their and others time with those crazy prices... If they want to take up their own space on items that will NEVER sell I guess that‚Äôs on them. I sell mine for 155 each because I exclusively go out looking for them since both of my characters are bugged and cant launch anyway....

I'm guilty of making nukashine for this reason.  I knew I wasn't alone!

Power armor is great for pve, mobility, ease of maintenance, it frees up some perk cards for quality of life perks etc. that being said theres only 2 builds I have read about for power armor in pvp. I have personally tried a lot of different configurations, but I just cannot pvp worth a crap in power armor / vamp laser gat combo. its just a horrible pvp build but awesome for pve. 
---
if you dont like power armor regular armor actually gets better in end game once you start getting legendaries. radiation is really the only problem but I see no power armor peeps in rd zones all the time so its doable. 
---
personally fallout isn't fallout without PA and jump jets for me but that's just personal preference. 
---
I just had 3 days off work. 
---
day 1 - I tweaked my supply line of serums to npc vendors, I farmed some fusion cores, I killed the queen a bunch, made enough caps to get a new serum recipe. ( sounds simple but 18000 caps is a lot to make in a single day) 
---
day 2- rinse repeat of day one except my gun broke and my wife flew in and provided really good coverage while I repaired. I made a joke about my wifes quantom power armor. "QUANTOM FORCE !!! HERE TO SAVE THE MUTHA FUCKIN DAY"  it cracked me up. we both use vamp ultracite laser gats so I went and painted my X-01 to the quantom paint job too. Intitially I went with the quantom paint to be funny but it has grown on me and to be fair we look pretty tight with matching guns and power armor. Quantom Force is starting to feel like a role I may be playing for awhile with the wife. oh also got another serum recipe. 
---
day 3 - all progress was halted on my quest for getting all serum recipes. I saw this vid [https://youtu.be/4VYGi8Q4deQ](https://youtu.be/4VYGi8Q4deQ)  and decided I wanted an air ship. I spent 12ish hours today farming fusion cores and working on my CAMP I have 280 something fusion cores. my air ship is glorious, I have Quantom Force over the entrance in neon letters, side wing designation is QFHQ (quantom force HQ) its got all four vendors a chemistry station a working shower and bath, a semi working bridge 8 heavy MGs 4 on each corner and its lit up. I didnt go with the generator fans instead I used lights to simulate thrusters. I started around 6 in the morning and got finished just in time for work  so literally all day I have done nothing but work on that ship. 
---
When I get off work I have to go kill the queen a ton because I am so fat with fusion cores I get overweight if I loot so much as a potato.
---
When I heard about the scrap box, I assumed that would be how it worked.   I was disappointed when it wasn‚Äôt account wide.
---
How do you know you are doing enough? If the others there are out DPS‚Äôing you, you might come up empty handed. I deal a shit ton of damage and there have been times I got nothing , dont think it was bugged, I just got out DPS‚Äôed and just didn‚Äôt make the cut for loot.
---
The whole player to player interaction in this game is bad, in my opinion. No guilds, no Raid matchmaking, no text chat... The only thing we do is trade.
---
For some reason it is, just unsure why. People will still buy them for 1k even though they are pretty easy to get
---
Kool
---
I agree the wanted player is at a huge disadvantage, but I kinda don't mind that all too much as it makes it more of a challenge for the "bad guy".     
---
I'd imagine that unless pacifist mode is the default setting once you get past lvl 5 that allowing wanted players to attack non pacifists would just cause too many complaints.  
---
But hey I'd be totally cool with making lvl 5 characters all pacifists by default, so this way only people who manually went into the settings to change that would be targets.
---
Can u guys fix God mode while you at it
---
And if you need anymore inspiration.
---
r/fallout76settlements
---
Cheat terminal mod. Fixes fast travel, lack of marsupial, and everything else. You don‚Äôt have to cheat, but gives you the ease of use.
---
Is this using an automatic reciever?
---
Nukashine roulette. Ten different drinks, 1 one in 10 chance of all the fun.
---
I also usually drink from other people's bowls and have gotten nukashine before, though more often they're empty :(
---
Why would it be inconvenient?
---
You don't need to scrap things in Fallout 4 (other than leather), you just dump the junk into the workbench and the game auto-scraps items whenever needed.
---
And that was so bad, they had to add vending machines.
---
Yes, powerful automatic receiver. Also suppressor. I use Commando perks and Covert Operative, also.
---
Yea you should opt in to pvp mode. They need to do something. I almost never see anyone in wanted and anytime i go wanted i just get melted usually before i can react.
---
It depends on how often you want to fire a critical. 
---
Do you want to know the minimum LCK you needed to get a critical every third shot with a +15 weapon? Or are you after a critical every other shot? 
---
Even with 35% fill you still only get a critical every third. You need 3* critical wavey and 45% fill to get every other.  Every third is easy to get, every other needs LCK in the mid 20s.
---
Crazy is fun
---
Are you on PS4?
---
If you quit because of all the glitches, you probably will quit again...
---
Thanks
---
I mean thats cuz Appalachia wasnt directly hit by nukes (ironically we nuke it to oblivion later) while Boston was hit by a nuke that created the glowing sea.
---
Not the best explanation, but it's AN explanation at least.
---
I‚Äôve noticed a shift in Morgantown quests as well. Back on the Beat happens constantly but you have to pull teeth to get to do Feed The People.
---
The reason I don't go for bounties is because they can get there revenge and most people I killed for their bounties will chase me for hours and strop over it.
---
I'd recommend making it so that after you claim a bounty they can't start start a PvP war over it. I feel more people would bother then.
---
In Fallout 4 you can just hit a button to bring the map up.  If you play on the PC, you hit M, for map.
---
I have not yet had fast travel stop or not work for me. Yet.. Hopefully that never happens
---
I‚Äôm thinking it might be a change in how often certain events spawn as a result of the buff to public events
---
I'm under the idea that there won't be
---
Heavy Combat Armor torso + 4 Heavy Robot limbs will give you the highest DR + Radiation Resist combination. That being said, If you like it? Get the legendary affixes you prefer, and wear it.
---
I was tired of running out as well and I spent the big bucks at the Enclave medical vendor. Now I have radaway for days. Small 900c-ish price to pay for not being frustrated :)
---
Check the individual damage stats and compare (ballistic, electric, rad). Also weight makes a difference.
---
That makes sense now that I think about it. I did get to do it with a big group last night. That made me happy. I missed that quest.
---
I have to both... Its great :D
---
That would be enough for me to buy it. Right then and there.
---
It wasn't so much all the junk I lost that bothered me, it was all the Stable Flux I lost and never have got back that pissed me off! I really couldn't care less about the Junk because I pretty much have replaced it. The Stable Flux is a problem tho it took forever to collect what I had!
---
Jaysus
---
That's assuming you're frequently dropping off at your various workshops. Its definitely due to how the games are meant to be played, but I always feel like I'm being slowed down massively by constantly having to run back to previous workshops to drop junk off when it starts getting too heavy. Having the ability to scrap things greatly decreases their weight when you're going around, and keeps you from having to drop things off for just a bit longer. Again, I mostly play on Survival mode when I do Fallout 4, so fast travel isn't an option when I get close to the weight limit either. It overall feels like a slog compared to Fallout 76.
---
Strong weapons? Good perks?
---
What is this Wastelanders everyone keeps mentioning? I could search it, but I love talking with people. Especially fans of the subject in question.
---
Filthy and Casual.
---
No my secret lead farm has been put on reddit xD
---
It'd be cool if they went back now and had an option to switch on live action VATS. I feel like that'd be a decently sizes download file though
---
It's already an incredible difference just having it in the first place, but this does seem like a very obvious improvement.
---
Or better yet, a big part of me believes the scrap box as it is should be a normal part of the game for everyone (it's just too big a quality of life improvement to restrict to a subscription), maybe instead a Fallout 1st perk could be upgrading the box from character to account shared?
---
Imagine if this was your first encounter ever with Graham
---
Especially for those on console. I'm on PC and have 2 accounts, so I can easily just share things with both accounts logged in. Console players are stuck, at best, drop-trading on their private server.
---
When it was happening to me, it wasn‚Äôt counting as a player attacking, so they just kept killing me over and over, and not getting a bounty.
---
I think it had a lot to do with the new content that came out for 4. I still swap between both.
---
Why does everyone in this thread keep complaining about having to drop everything on the ground in Fallout 4 in order to scrap it?
---
You don't have to do this!  You can just press one button to dump all your junk into the workbench.  The game will automatically scrap things if you need them to build something or upgrade a weapon or armor.
---
People are also repeatedly claiming that in Fallout 4 you can only access the map through the pipboy.  But you can just press a button (the M button on the PC) to access the map instantly.
---
I had no idea I could sell nuclear key cards...
---
PA is great for pvp, if you know what you're doing -  never rush, don't get vatsed, build around stimpaks, use good weapons. By playing around its strengths one can do pretty well, except against some really outlier combos (*cough BE Lasers*).
---
Oh, it's a big update they planned to roll out this month, but it got pushed back to Q1 2020. It's the one that will add human NPCs and a lot of new features, apparently.
---
I have an AAE submachine gun. fired probably 500-800 rounds on it. that not enough? lol
---
Lmao he looks so pissed at you!
---
Yep
---
Shotguns are close to medium range VATs crit weapons. They work very well with Vampire's, Furious, Bloodied, and Junkies Legendary. Enforcer perk allows you to Crowd Control, and the stagger from whatever perk that was reliably keeps SB, Mirelurks Queens, and Deathclaws sprawled out, ready to be painted like one of your French girls. 
---
Build like a Commando, except use 12 STR instead of 15 PER. Remember to VATs. Avoid explosive.
---
End game of FO4 is worse honestly unless you use mods
---
Yeah but plants actually thrive in radiation so it doesnt make sense. Fallout 1,2 and new vegas were dead bc theyre deserts.
---
What‚Äôs your armor? What‚Äôs your level?
---
Xbox, so i was never blessed by thatüò≠
---
So can I but I would be fine using atoms for content and asset mods, as long as the stuff was priced reasonably and/or community modders were being paid. Ideally QOL/polish mods would be free for everyone.
---
My idea of doing something really stupid would be ridiculous pricing and/or general low quality of the feature. Both are possible but I'm not too cynical just yet. :P
---
Sorry for the dumb question - but is the advantage to scrapping junk at benches to have less weight or is there another advantage?
---
LOL yeah lol once he shows up might as well pack it up and call it a day on that server lol.
---
I know that you can dump the scrap directly into your workbenches without having to scrap things. That's alright. Its when I'm out and about before I have every workshop out there. It means that while I'm out I have to constantly make trips back to drop things off, as opposed to extending my time out looting by scrapping all the junk I'm gonna have scrapped anyways to lessen the weight.
---
As far as the map thing goes, its not really an issue of how you get to it, so much as how it functions. Yes there's mods to give it different appearances and such, but those don't match up to the map that 76 gives you. The 76 map has landmarks indicated as more than just fast travel marks, and give you an idea of neat things you should go explore to find out, whereas the Fallout 4 map simply gives you a flat map without much to it.
---
Sweet. Thanks!
---
But it's different. FO4 is a single player game, it's not supposed to have an endgame. You do the sidequests, explore locations and do the main quest, and by that time you've probably played dozens of hours. Then the DLCs come out and you are at it again. And yes, mods are just too much fun and can add so much content.
---
This happened to me too! I fast-traveled to my camp and one turret was attacking another, and also my structure! When I pointed toward it, the name and health bar showed up red like it was an enemy. I ended up scrapping it and rebuilding it then it was normal. But, it's now happened twice.
---
I have the same problem with the challenge you mentioned....ya know since bethesda "fixed" the issue with challenges not registering
---
Do bobble heads still stack?
---
That bugfix will be released Summer 2102 when the vaults open.
---
Except I didn't say that Fallout 4 was bad? I loved playing Fallout 4, and I actually have more time into it than most other games I own. Its just hard getting back into how to play it after playing Fo76, with the streamlining they did on things. I'm still working around to getting a good mod list done up for getting certain things that 76 actually does right to get Fallout 4 closer to those things.
---
Using the ultracite pa and level 81. My boyfriend is lvl 138 using excavation pa. It doesn‚Äôt matter what weapon we have or use these players are one hitting us every time. No matter what level they are....it annoying and frustrating
---
Events spawn depending on when the last time it spawned and also how many events are on the map. I clear as many events as I can when o play and I don‚Äôt see any lack of options. Fly swagger happened twice this morning for me. 
---
Unfortunately it looks like you have to complete the less desired events to make way for the ones you want.
---
its not an exploit    stop being a baby
---
been playing since beta. I spent 12 hours today turning my camp into an airship. its glorious. I am fullfilled, and no I cannot lick my elbow.
---
Come join the freestates!
---
Sounds groovy. I just started on PS4 late October and really enjoy most of the game. I don't like the shared caps between vendors though. Pain in thw booty.
---
I know I‚Äôm a bit late to this poll, but I‚Äôve been able to find it at Fort Defiance twice. I do a few runs every time I play and have gotten every color at least twice.

---
My camp is by site alpha, a yao gui spawning site. I would estimate 1 in 10 yao guis that spawn there are ghouls.
---
Hmm interesting thanks
---
Why do you want to do fly swatter? Does it have a good drop?
---
76 has been in the most played games list since launch, and has been sitting around #36 for months. I don't think FO4 has ever left the list.
---
Way to skew the data?
---
ok, that makes sense. thanks.
---
Gotcha, but as long as I don't engage their damage is negligible. Flea bites basically.. The only way I'm dying from a direct attack is if I'm afk for a long time.  Meanwhile I don't have to worry about accidentally triggering PvP. 
---
As far as 'so badly burned' that's not possible. It's just a game. IDGAF enough to get 'badly burned'. If I lose some junk, oh well. I never carry much anyways and there's plenty more in the wasteland.
---
9 ranks of expert commando, max tank killer, max bloody mess.
---
Yea, there‚Äôs an event where you can get a pilgrim blunderbuss
---
Ah, that must be what I'm thinking of.
---
There's also a bug going around that makes people invincible. It could be that.
---
Also, you shouldn't worry about people telling you they will mess with your camp - unless you are already in PvP with them, there's nothing they can do. Now a Workshop is a different story.
---
No, killed 4 2* just as i typr this
---
It's not an MMO and doesn't emphasize endgame/progression, so you can start playing any time you want. 
---
Also, the game hasn't developed very well in the last few months but it went through a fairly good time after launch and has improved in a lot of little ways and a few notable ways. So in that sense people joining later in its life will probably have a better time.
---
In the end it's all up to how much you like the gameplay and world, and how much patience you have for the hiccups during the adventure.
---
FFR? And yeah this guy changed weapons two or three times and still one shot
---
Those are bats, op talking about the weapon
---
I would love to see the list where you got that from, truly.

Wtf

r/lifehacks for sure
---
Grahm not happy.  Graham not his name. No meet for you.
---
PA is lower echelon armor. If.your want higher resistance you can go vanguard for full health build or bolstering for low health build.  Theres perk cards that help as well, lonewander, blocker, fire proof  dodgy and serendipity for additional damage mitigation
---
I wouldn't be surprised if that "fix" for energy weapons being affected by armor penetration didn't affect the ultracite lasers for whatever reason, wouldn't be the first time something like that happened. Otherwise, just really tanky enemies soaking it up
---
I love how when this game came out all of the ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù fallout fans suddenly hated bugs and glitches, as if every fallout game hasn‚Äôt been riddled with bugs
---
Don't know how accurate of a metric it is, but you've never seen the 50 most played games list in the store?
---
Die by my hand, I creep across the land, killing first born man, I'm creeping death
---
Not that I know of. Looked like a rifle
---
Even scorched? Like I do 80ish to robot sentry bots and naked 68 scorched.
---
Dude it‚Äôs a multiplayer spinoff.
---
Your in pa, which is horrible for pvp fights. Try getting a good set of something else, such as sentinels. Also they cant 1 shot, but if they have ffr weapons it may seem like a one shot. If you arent doing damage it may be do to your perks. Hes tanking damage because he is pvp perk spec. Probably has a set of sentinels or similar pvp armor too. I've fought people who did zero damage to me, I've also fought those who burned me down. All comes down to perks and gear. Do not engage in pvp unless you are ready for it. Be careful going in to fights around your camp too.
---
Yet they can't give us the immediate local area map for interiors or outside areas.
---
I relied on that map in so many confusing building interiors from 3 through NV to 4.  Can't tell you how many times I've gotten lost in WS Resort and other places like West Tek or the Surveillance building the Enclave sends you too to name a few.
---
Maybe that's on me, but I do miss that local area map badly.  Considering how many unmarked POI's there are on the world map too, that local map would've done people a lot of justice in mapping out where they all are.
---
I love my LMG, but damn. The. Ammo. I have the prime plan for it, but I'm afraid I'd go from scrounging/grinding regular 308 to running out of flux for 308 Ultracite. You run into that problem?
---
E means nothing to the SBQ,  she has high resistance,  For a smg gun, get close and shoot her head.
---
There is only 1 thing keeping me off 76 (awaiting Wastelanders) and playing Fallout 4 again, and that's the automated machines. I still hold out hope that we can get those at our camps.
---
I love going from settlement to settlement, killing off the raiders, dropping their corpses on conveyors, having machines break them down and auto sort the meat and ammo into containers, the parts into hoppers where they are made into MORE ammo, and then all the bones dumped into a giant pit.
---
FO76 doesn't scratch that itch for me yet.
---
Ffr is faster fire rate. Could be this or his gear and perks are what is burning you down.
---
Did you absorbed their souls as well?
---
No worries
---
On xbox the emote and favorite wheel are jankey. Sometimes you will have like a trade icon bug and everyone can see it but you.
---
Ah, that one. Yes, of course I have. It's not a playercount, though; it doesn't show active, concurrent players.
---
If you love the series, you stick with it. It‚Äôs as simple as that.
---
Are the damage numbers on in your view?
---
Yes, i ate their brains while i was at it
---
Isn't night in this game classified as 6pm to 6am?
---
My missile launcher will attack my scrap robot if it's out on 1 character only. If I scrap and rebuild them both, it just restarts firing.
---
Yeah I can relate to that.
---
There's a static spawn for one I don't remember where it is but I think it's at West Tek I could be wrong about the location
---
This is imo a glitch, starting after a patch, around patch......12?  14?  They never could do that before, now they can and maybe...just maybe it was done intentionally to make farming asylum outfits harder.
---
Pvp broke my friend
---
What mods should I be using besides prime receiver which I do have
---
Oh really? That's handy,tho if it is that one we've not been there yet so I might have to make a trip down there
---
Feed the people shifted from being triggered by just visiting Mama Dolce‚Äôs to being one of the server wide public events.
---
Yeah, but I heard its a gradual buff, only 50% at midnight
---
I kinda agree, for one I think that Fo76 VATS is much more realistic, which in turn is more immersive and exciting. Still love Fo4 tho!
---
Nice that takes me back
---
Yep. ^^ I'm starting to think the same except nuke zones
---
Nah I don't got that
---
No I have vats increase and FFR
---
West-Tek is correct; it's on the roof.
---
That‚Äôs no fun. At least I can still trigger Collision course by wandering into the airport.
---
Yeah Fort Defiance does actually get the invincible enemy glitch common enough to be a real pain.
---
Hello Radroach meet my Baseball Bat.

?
---
As as I know, no. Mostly for display or "just because".
---
Yeah, I really want to give up the shotgun sometimes, but it's so damn fun running one shots all the way through the tunnel, burrows, and West Tech. And shot gun ammo drops like rain. Never craft or buy it.
---
Ah okay,I might grab one to surprise my friend then hah, we can all have one each then lmao
---
Drama and gripes aside, Bethesda is "all hands on deck" for Wastelanders because I think they realize this is their last check to write. If this one bounces, I dont think FO76 lasts another year.
---
So because of that, the 'new content' is in two groups: scripted 'kill the spawns' events. Dont get me wrong, I had a BLAST killing things at Whitespring this past October - but that's all it was: timed spawns.
---
The other group of 'content' is 'discounts at the legendary script vendor'
---
oh, you may have heard for the junk stash box? There's your lion's share of new content: tucked comfortably behind a paywall.
---
After playing Fallout: New Vegas, playing Fallout 76 seems like a waste of god damn time, money, effort, and waste of life. I would rather play with 2 ants on a sidewalk. Id rather play with a blender or radio plugged into the wall and drop it in my bathtub while im bathing. Id rather hang myself. Id rather set myself on fire.
---
copy that. thats pretty much what i did. Ill keep trying though lol
---
Being well-rested is an XP boost for 2 hours. (Getting killed makes you not well rested). The ‚ÄúFeed the People‚Äù quest gives you canned stew that is also an co boost. Various foods will modify your stats (ie pumpkin soup is +2 to your perception for a while, glowing meat steaks are +10% damage for melee attacks)
---
The static spawn ruined the price for the pies  I don't know any reason to go get any
---
how can i activate them? im on ps4.
---
Your going to be waiting a long time
---
Damn,did they used to go for a lot? I took a big break just before shops were introduced
---
It's been a while since I played, but I remember dealing &lt;50% pip boy damage even with armor piercing receivers and legendary effects on weapons
---
Xbox? You can join our group, we run the Queen all day long.  Queen Killers R Us
---
There you go. :)
---
I want VATS back to how it was previously. If they dont go back I'm never playing FO again.
---
Yes they did go for alot which I miss
---
Yeah, I notice a ton of diffenence with Stabilized and my Gatling laser on the SBQ
---
Yeah mine started with the crap it being attacked, I had to pack my camp up an move it somewhere else , it started with the junk bot, but then it started attacking cooking stations and water purifiers!
---
It's pie. You eat baked flies and mutated shit and melons. Pie is decent, civilised food. That's my reason.
---
Damn,to be fair even if I was around I still probably couldnt pull one haha
---
I've been rediculously lucky, and managed to get 23 pies in my 900 hours of play time. Three in one day is my record, one from silo Charlie, one from Watoga and one from Morgantown high school. 
---
Haven't got one in a long while though. I stopped running around 95% bloodied so my luck is much lower.
---
Most played, is still most played, especially with 65 million active XB Live members. 
---
Are you talking about the Trueachievements charts? I've always wondered where they get their data from. They say they're pulling from a list of 1 million users, but I can't find anything about how/where they're pulling data from non-TA members.
---
Also, it isn't cause the ghouls 'belong to BoS', many people even at Fort Defiance didn't have access to that elevator as per the lore, it was reserved for basically command personnel.
---
Further those ghouls can enter the highest in command's personal room, which is only accessible by one person which you have to find to access their room to continue the main quest.
---
It is a glitch, I swear.
---
You really don‚Äôt need to run full health with a stealth build, unless you‚Äôre exclusively running Vault 94 where broken stealth is nearly certain.  Low health provides such a huge boost to DPS and stealth ability that it feels like 50% of the build.  The difference between 20 AG and 35 is enormous.
---
I have an AA/E handmade sitting in the stash.  I‚Äôll have to bust it out, bump up to full health and give it a look.  9 damage seems ridiculously low.
---
It's an always online multiplayer spin off game. You're not getting an offline single player mode, which in my opinion would be very boring after completing the main quest anyway.
---
But I've never understood Junkie. Do you need to keep taking the drugs you're addicted to to maintain the 50 percent damage? And how do you kick it off, sit in your camp and eat handfuls of drugs? I run bloodied build and sick of eating radaway diluted then getting every disease in the wasteland (except the elusive whoopsies)
---
Thanks for the suggestion! :) I tried this, but It didn't seem to help.
---
Holy shit,that's insane haha. Do you just keep them all or sell em?
---
Yet another foodbuild complaining, just fast travel away
---
Most played at some point in history for a couple of weeks isn't the same as most played for the past 10 months.
---
Yeah, Trueachievements is the one. They literally tell you how they calculate data on their page.
---
We mean in the game though.
---
Lever is better, hunting 50 is best. Some people like Gauss, but it is too clunky for me.
---
Keep them all, I have some on display at the moment (8 I think) but the rest are in the stash. 
---
I just like to have them honestly, they're not really worth anything. I wish they gave you a unique buff or something similar.
---
Yeah seems like all the effort for one should at least give you a 5% exp boost or something at minimum
---
I leave a sign indicating content. Like, free whiskey, wine, etc. Nuka is what I drink. 
---
One of my characters keeps a steady supply of Old Possum. 
---
When I visit other places, it tends to be Nuka. Even those with a sign saying: "totally not nukashine'".
---
the heal effect adds  the same heal per hit, but it stacks, so faster hitting is faster/more heal stacks
---
It dose not scale with dmg, it's only per hit. So faster firing weapons do better. Shout guns heal each pellet.
---
Also explosions count, so a tse will give you 4 procs per shot
---
Im on ps4. Hopefully next time i run a silo or some group does i can do some more dmg on it.
---
It depends on how you play.  I tend to have a main base and use other settlements as rest stops.  Sanctuary, Starlight Drive-in, Greygarden or Hangman's Alley, then Vault 88.  Hangman's can get really crash prone, so I shift away from it later in the game.  If you have a main base, scrapping helps you track more or less where your crafting materials are at, so you know what to buy in as shipments or what to scavenge if you get bored of grabbing everything not nailed down.  If you do want to grab everything, the portable junk recycler is a quality of life mod.  I think there is also a mod that allows you to place beacons in range of a settlement with a radio operator to come grab scrap in the same container if you want something more story immersive.
---
My buddie got one a couple weeks ago
---
U can't get a TSE and a vampiric effect on the same weapon
---
But you can‚Äôt get a vampires tse lol
---
I've been having a issue. When I leave my server it says my world is full and I can't rejoin. Even if my friends are in the server and send me a invite. I can't rejoin my own server. I always gotta start a new one. Bethesda support ticket was a copy and paste reply. The 1st sub was a gift from a friend and it sucks when I can't use it.
---
Lol didn't even think I'll edit it, it's 3am where I'm at. But the point is the same, explosions proc it and it will proc per pellet
---
2edgy4me
---
If the overseers quest line starts feeling like you‚Äôre underpowered, take some time and explore the ash heap to the south and Grafton etc to the north. 
---
Stay well rested for an xp boost.
---
Yeah, I edited. It's 3am for me lol
---
Yessir.  Sorry, FEV fucked my brain
---
Yeah I was just saying sadly us xbox players also share your frustration with emotes.
---
I didn't even know there was one. Now i'm interested, lol. Atom Cats are sick!
---
Isn't that a devroom item? If so, it's dangerous to have it.
---
This. I agree with how inconvenient it is to have to constantly run back and forth in FO4 to store junk since you can't scrap it. It feels like a chore and super unenjoyable. But to each their own.
---
Yes
---
Explosive is hopeless against scorchbeasts, B25 handmade or combat rifle with commando perks is good against anything. Assault rifle is the worst of those 3 auto rifles. 
---
Also you can also spam crits (every 3-4 shots) by holding down the assigned crit button/key when firing to get even more damage, but you'll need to put 15 in Luck and take Critical Savvy 3, Four Leaf Clover 3, Better Criticals 3 to get the most out of it.
---
Lever is not as quick for taking down large groups of enemies, but still great fun.
---
No but my ultracite PA disappeared a week or so ago... Think I may have logged out too soon after collecting it from mods... Danged save delay....
---
are you not familiar with the marine helmet I'm speaking on? I feel like a lot of people never played fallout 4's far harbor. The Marine Helmet I'm referring to is unobtainable.
---
Why would you think there'd be a singleplayer mode for a multiplayer exclusive game?
---
Nah, d1 was eh, not enough unique items that were good. D2:LoD was best, with d3 close behind outside of the BS RMAH.
---
This new mode looks challenging!
---
I‚Äôm on PC, I‚Äôm referring to the marine armor helmet that was brought out of the dev room by hawthorn and is a plan anyone can learn now.
---
Hawthorn was a mate of mine, I‚Äôm the person who distributed the helmet, the one you could scrap to learn. I am VERY familiar with it.
---
It is only unobtainable now for console players which I assume you are.
---
I played a lot over the weekend and didnt notice any turret issues
---
Personally I enjoy vats in Fo4 over 4 and NV because it made you think 3 steps in advanced with the mods I have i basically know humanoids need head shots while insects i can just body shot so i know that before I even enter vats
---
This is false. It is only dangerous to have these items if you are the one who retrieved it from the dev room. Bethesda has made it clear that they are not banning accounts for having these items, only accounts that use exploits to retrieve them. If OP bought this item from another user, the worst case scenario is that Bethesda removes the items from your inventory. This being a PA paint may result in losing a set of armor, but will not result in a ban.
---
Can I get human npcs?
---
Lol. I'll spam emails to them and try
---
Haha no worries, it‚Äôs a fun theoretical
---
Just to let you know it might just be PS4 and my buddy has had the same issue and I've lately been having the problem only while placing turrets at my workshop at poseidon energy
---
I was at Whitespring station yesterday and the turrets at someone‚Äôs camp there were going nuts on nothing, just firing at the camp. I wondered about that.
---
Yes, for a lower level that misses the helmet piece that could be the answer.
---
Ah, good.
---
I have felt the same every time a newer game has come out.
---
Okay I will be waiting for them. Don‚Äôt tell me sweet little lies and promise me them if you can‚Äôt deliver!
---
Yes exactly, I'm aware PC has the duped dev room version which allows people to craft and own one. Had it not been taken from the dev room I'm sure like console players you wouldn't have it as well yet.
---
If I can't deliver, I shall slit my earlobes
---
Yep, I was at a camp checking their vending machines yesterday and the turrets were all firing on the camp.
---
Traveled to my camp to find one of my turrets was hostile and killed my Brahmin. Today a turret on another character started after my junk bot.
---
I don't. I want the slower, almost turn based combat mechanics back. Realistically, I don't ever expect to see that back in the series... and that saddens me.
---
Okay well when I get them can you promise they‚Äôll just work?
---
Yea happens to me every login, but only one of the turrets, its weird. Storing and re-placing it fixes it.
---
I see people gathering resources and doing the Excavator thing at the mine... To be honest, the best solution is to use different calibers or a melee weapon for some enemies. Otherwise, you'll be constantly running out of ammo, whatever you craft. 
---
I was having problems with my 10mm smg until I started using an instigating knife for low level enemies, and a fixer 38. Now, I craft ammo regularly and have more every day.
---
Im on ps4 but i dont take workshops. So thats why i fidnt notice lol
---
Na happens to me and I'm pc
---
Yeah I would appreciate it back but unless Bethesda sells the rights to someone else we'll keep getting fallout painted FPS games.
---
Fellow on my world had it for sell for 2k, which honestly i wasn't aware at first.
---
I‚Äôve noticed mine doing it. They‚Äôll go hostile but just shoot in  a random direction not damaging anything. I finally said screw it and got rid of them around my base.
---
+ still +.. mode game + is. Wut
---
Alright thanks for a solution. It's stupid that this is even a problem
---
Just know you may lose any set of armor you put it on. I believe they recently purged a lot of the wood masks, so just beware. Also, I believe they remove it from your craft able list as well.
---
Haha. You're funny üòÇ
---
You are talking about the tent. OP is asking about the stash box specifically
---
Aid
---
Not how they calculate it, but where they get the data from? I know TA has several hundred thousand members, but Microsoft isn't exactly known for being forthcoming with their user data.
---
Yes, Misc.
---
Also make sure my npcs have 16 times the detail
---
Huh, thanks. I'll check it once i'm in game.
---
I agree with your system.  I like it.  Especially with Rose thrown in for good measure.
---
Maybe even just go to Rose and have a repeatable quest with a bounty that follows you until you die, or kill another player.  No idea how the mechanic would worth with more than 1v1
---
Maybe 100 caps and.... I don't remember what game it originated from... an ear.  Then the requisite Atom Shop purchase for your ear display.
---
Most replies on this board tend to be people hijacking the thread and just puking out their ideas.
---
Thats not what hes saying. Hes pointing out that a vampires explosive would heal twice as much.
---
The plasma with the splitter. It has an incredibly high RoF, crazy good dmg, and gives you 10 heals per shot
---
Each vendor use to have separate caps (per faction) but they only had 200 each.
---
Yeah i've had my power armor sibce level 15 im level 31 and still no power helmet so i use a miner hat when i wear my power armor
---
How about level does that jave anything to do with it or does every vampires heal the same amount per hit?
---
Damn, I just missed trading for one the other day
---
Damn. Maybe just 1000 per faction? I understand the fear of duping, but I needs me caps.
---
level doesnt have an effect, it is soley based on hit speed since the heal amount is a pre set number
---
While I agree that this sort of behavior shouldn't be accepted, I'm not sure an automatic ban is the right way to handle it. If I feel like screwing around and I put a nuke mine in a players camp, once, while playing solo, should I be banned? What if the player assumes I'm trying to exploit them and they get me banned?
---
I have not tried a VE gattling laser, but I would assume it worse since you can't put a splitter on it
---
That sucks that you missed the chance to get a plasma. The VE plasma is my go to at full health, I only die when I kill myself lol
---
Ive got a be, VE, tse, and FE. The be n VE are the best guns I've ever had, and Ive had a fair share of great guns lol
---
winner winner chicken dinner , shia we are doing nude nuka shine night !
---
Much appreciated!
---
Or mini nukes for 100c. Geez
---
If it's any consolation, they become pointless. People are usurping cap limit with bullets &amp; other 1cap items. Or, in market sense, trade only.
---
Its a given when it comes to FO, hoard the cash, but no so much with 76.
---
yeah you need components to mods weapons and armor and you need to throw all your junk to the ground and enter workshop mode to scrap them one by one while f76 is just using the workbench and 2 buttons, all done
---
unless you use dunno the scraptron but still clunky
---
I'd be more to 76 if the whole thing wasnt just so janky at times. It's just nice to not be at the mercy of the servers just to access a simple terminal (final straw for me was the Dolce terminal softlocking me) Not to mention the mod scene for 4 has given us some great custom animated weapons like the Wattz, F4NV Anti Material Rifle, that crazy Magnum Revolver Rifle.
---
I do wish Beth would actually bother to backport some of 76's QoL stuff into 4 so I could have the best of both worlds, but with their track record I highly doubt it.
---
the scraptron? it works well but once you put that you can't move it anymore or the buttons will be floating xd
---
Okay satan
---
Yes and no. I would also like a sad tune on the grand piano, but I want it in the Cranberry Bog where the mushroom cloud of a launched nuke is visible in the background. But maybe I‚Äôm pretentious.
---
I totally understand that. I've noticed for a while now, that once I get use to a newer Fallout/TES game it becomes much harder for me to go back to the others. Same with Skyrim over Oblivion. Or Fallout 4 over New Vegas. I'm kinda wondering if TES 6 will have the same affect on Skyrim.
---
Give it time ,games only been out a year (sarcasm)
---
‚ÄúBeen here all along‚Äù
---
Your are like 10 months late with the tse weapons
---
Hmmmmmm. Interesting with the Vendor method. I only sell bullets because I really like crafting them, but my main source of income has come from "raiding" NPC heavy towns and taking my slow overencombered booty and selling all of their gear to the nearest Vendor.
---
You can move your CAMP module near West-Tek or some other high-level enemies with ranged attacks, then switch servers until the animal arrives. Aggro the enemies and lure them over. 
---
Or, have a friend attack your character and try shooting back with pacifist mode turned OFF to initiate PVP.
---
Or, tame a different animal and it will be replaced. Equip rank 1 of Animal Friend and hop around [these locations](https://i.imgur.com/JxLe1Qp.jpg) in The Forest region. The spawn chance is roughly 6-10%.
---
Not a bad method really, do it myself with super mutants etc. But yeah, no restriction on player vendors, can max out quick if ya got stuff people want.
---
Honestly. I would love if they took a page from the silent Hill team from Konami. Those small piano pieces are just to die for. 
---
That's just me though folks. Nothing wrong with what they got now... Just want my Mire pieces to reflect the zone a little better. Just kinda wierd when I sit and play the grand covered in comes and it's some jazzy upbeat hahah
---
Stable Flux is on Junk and Raw Flux is on Aid
---
Yeah. I think people undervalue just how many improvements fo76 made on fo4
---
Fallout 4 players are Fallout 76 players and vice versa. I got bored of FO4 long before 76 was announced. I'm a little bored of 76, so I went back to FO4 like many others I'm sure. I'm a PC player, so despite all of the mods at my disposal, still bored. The one thing you can't discount is the multiplayer aspect...you never know what will happen, good or bad.
---
It appears to me you're trying to throw shade, even though you said you weren't, so I'm going to call bullshit on your post. People, like myself, enjoy the Fallout universe, bugs be damned. I dislike FO4 for as many reasons as I dislike FO76, but it's a love/hate relationship with both. There's no love lost bouncing between the two.
---
The only thing you're right about is wanting more content. You're not dissimilar from every other Fallout enthusiast...
---
How did you add in game breaking bugs and random disconnects?
---
Concerning 5mm or any ammo that shows 0 weight with Bandoleer 2, that it takes 10,000 rounds to equal 1 pound.
---
Oh I'm the complete opposite, I started playing 4 again and realized how dog shit 76 really is compared to it
---
Aw, that'd be a really sweet gesture!
---
^^^Literally. ^^^;)
---
Yep happening at my camp too, even saw it happen at the prison break event fixed the turrets and they started shooting each other lol.
---
I mean, being a dick to support workers is *always* a shitty move.
---
Doesn't sound like what OP was doing, but there's no reason to increase the stress on some hapless, overworked employee who has to deal with angry people all day and has no influence on the higher decisions that piss everyone off.
---
Incorrect? It's the 25th right now...tomorrow would at noon would agree with your post
---
The recipes for Mud Cookie and Mountain Hocks have static world spawns, along with the Upgraded Motor. Just type the names into Map76.com
---
Don't kids and drink, type.    
---
Edited it to correctly reflect rumors a few mins ago.
---
Umm you know a purveyor sale is coming in a couple days right?
---
Tomorrow 12 EST
---
I feel they would announce it at the last minute, downt want people *not* spending money
---
The biggest thing I actually missed about 76 was the real-time VATS, which was shocking because I thought that it was gonna be the thing that annoyed me the most about 76. Turns out I find VATS way more interesting when I can use it strategically rather than sporadically.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen as well
---
So you want to take a sad song and make it better?  Ok Jude
---
Aren't serums under Aid?
---
OMG. I would love " ok Jude "
---
Was cycling through 5mm,  .50 cal, melee, lazer rifle, and combat rifle, just the used the 5mm on all the big enemies and ran the queen a few times in a row
---
One shot weapons benefit from faster reload. It basically takes the place of fire rate. Cant fire very fast if you slowly reload after every shot.
---
I would need a Marsupial mod in order to play 4 again
---
Thanks for helping prove to me it wasn't all in my head and that this game as a game-breaking issue imo
---
I may start a fallout faction up again...ü§î
---
You can also learn it by scrapping the helmets.  if you're on PC and you need a few to try and learn it I can help you out.
---
Would bolt action be considered one shot?
---
If you notice the animation for the bolt is faster.
---
Thank you for letting me know. I have to say I'm disappointed, but not surprised-- when I was thinking on it more myself, I started thinking that's how they'd work anyways. There's a lot of logistics issues that'd likely crop up with travelling companions being a thing.
---
Tent has one
---
Ok, thanks
---
Makes sense. I'm glad I could help. :3
---
I wish Bethesda would offer one last QOL update to fallout 4 and add scrapping.
---
In the settings from the map. You‚Äôll be surprised how little damage you are doing to the queen.
---
Yes sir, a lot of the bad stuff was over blown anyway
---
I live that mod, just for the satisfying visuals of the weapons firing and people's heads popping. Bullet time + the over-the-top muzzle flash and ricochets mod = damn near cinematic
---
I know but the way you made it sound is that you can slap down a scrap box at your camp and that alone will stop others camps from loading in
---
Same here. Only my response was " Please be aware that Atoms are placed in a wallet on the platform they were purchased from originally. " What the hell is the wallet? XB1 btw.
---
The vats button on PS4 is L1. L1 in The Outer Worlds is the "use the inhaler" button. I used up SO MANY of the healing gas things because I'd be tapping the "VATS" button as I walked around.
---
"I just started shooting"
---
It's the only reason I collect Quantums.
---
The fast travel itself is broken as well. How many times have you fast traveled somewhere just to be dropped off half way? 
---
At least 5 for me. I'm sure they'll have these bugs squashed when the game launches tho...oh.
---
Haven't camped there since like seven camps ago. Still happens every time I visit him... you know to kill him and whatnot
---
I mean Fallout 4 is a Game Pass, so more or less a free game. It will always have a decent playerbase.
---
Definen rock the robot armor, get the assaultron healmet and a gatling laser! Its sooo cool!
---
lol go beat your dick to a picture of Todd Howard fucking you in the ass then.
---
I'd just block them on Xbox and server hop if they are being an issue.
---
thats some shit lol. do you know how much damage is the minimum to get loot?
---
I had this happen to me by grafton steel spawn. It allows you to see enemies and npc from quite a ways out but not really helpful for your team since there are no reference points. You yourself cant see obstacles you have to navigate around so you usually die from getting stuck on something or not being able to loot anything. =/
---
What you like is how Bethesda streamlined the infinite gambling cycle portion of their 'shoot and loot' game. Its definitely easier this way to get that gambling dopamine high.
---
Favourites wheel and settlement building menu are two improvements I really missed when I recently played Fallout 4. Also the dang draw distance in Fallout 4 is atrocious compared to 76 (at least on PC).
---
&gt; Bloodied commando
---
Have a link to the specific one?
---
It's easy until you get to the point where they are all kill 7600 of something rather than 76 of it.
---
Hey no problem glad to help and if you really want to speed up a bolt action acquire the speed demon mutation.
---
That leads to even worse graphics somehow.
---
Nuthin‚Äô but Nukashine.
---
Thank you so much!! I was about spend all my script just now üòÇ
---
I‚Äôm guessing you aren‚Äôt using power armour? I‚Äôm using an X-01 suit with emergency protocols and I very rarely die. If I do it‚Äôs because I get gangbanged by mirelurk hunters and their op acid damage. Also if you keep some toxic water and diluted radaway, upkeep is easy.
---
There are player vendors in the game now, which basically creates an economy among the players in your map. These vendors allow you to pick up some loot for the price of caps. Also, there is a legendary vendor. So when you have a legendary you don‚Äôt want, take it to a train station and redeem the weapon for script. Script can used to purchase other legendary weapons at the train station in Berkeley springs I believe.
---
Alright, how do you get a vendor thing? Does it just come with your camp?
---
I don't know about the pianos but I definitely think the Jukebox should play something a little more lively than that dreary, ambient piano tune it loops constantly. lol
---
It's a new bug
---
Yeah, you can just build them in your camp. I don‚Äôt think you need a plan or anything. It‚Äôs an amazing way to make extra caps on stuff you really don‚Äôt need
---
Alright sick! Thanks!
---
Modern problems require modern solutions
---
No, they want people to instantly spend 1st Atoms. Then, a week later, when everyone's atom piggy bank is bone dry, release the assortment of 1 day sale items, making it so you cant grind for atoms, or simply wait and not spend what you've got now. Keep us in the dark works more to their advantage than informing us, unfortunately. Makes me question the items I get from shop based on timing.
---
Camp building has more things to do, Vault94 "raid", 3 quest(or more?) lines, some repeatable quests, few new events and legendary vendor. There actually isn't that much new content in year 1 and the endgame is still very similar. 
---
Oh yeah, and a BR mode.
---
This has been happening to me for the past week, very annoying.
---
Remove PvP from adventure and put survival mode back in. ü§î
---
ugh that shouldn't be the case, honestly I don't know what's wrong with it sry
---
It's good to hear camps play a bigger role! My favorite part of the new fallouts has been the building so now I'm glad it plays a more important role.
---
Thank you, i'll try to do it by myself.
---
Oh good it‚Äôs not just me either. I swear all a feral ghoul needs to do is look in my general direction and I get crippled.
---
Honestly
---
That‚Äôs just life in the ruthless wasteland man
---
Get Fallout 1st, farm fusion cores, win big ol time
---
An the award for best solution goes to...
---
Just noticed this today. My turret was attacking scrap bot. It seemed to have started with an attack on my camo by some robots and now the turrets just constantly shoot scrap bot.
---
Beyond the stupidest comment I've ever read on reddit.
---
You sir are daft as fuck. Grats.

The game world data should be mostly compatible. But yeah, there is more to games than just the world and I doubt the rest of the game systems would be fine with it outright.

If you‚Äôre trying to sell them to players in order for them to do the tourist quest they have to loot them off the NPCs to get the plans to repair and do all that backpack shit.
---
Neon letters plan would be a god send
---
That's basically how game engines work. They evolve every game and get better. I have hopes that their next game will have co-op capability.
---
Skk global stash actually does most of that but adds the extra value of consolidating your workshop stashes all to one global stash.
---
Ohhhh, a Jumbo Mr Fuzzy! And a 1 dmg dealing snowball thrown item!
---
they cant fix workshop pvp without overhauling every single aspect of pvp. the problem isnt just the mechanic's of the work shop its the way the armor and builds are easily exploitable to create extremely lopsided fights, stealth mechanics are poop, and the fact that when you lose the respawn is instant and nearby. its the single shittiest pvp system I have seen in any game since 1996. broken , pointless, exploitable, its nothing more than a mechanic for the mentally ill to grief other players with. if you play with any intent of being honorable you are just going to die to opponents exploiting and hacking. people complain about beth selling collectrons as pay to win but if you go on the internet right now you can buy equipment for the only viable "meta's" for pvp. and if you dont. you're just going to die. and also to fix pvp they will have to trash the legacy weapons. they need to just delete that shit. its all been duped to hell and back. the entire pvp scene does nothing but prop up the trade for the duped weapon market online. its why some grief , its why those nimrods want you to pvp. they need people to get pissed and "fight back" by buying the pay to win garbage. look up legendaries for sale on google. 45 and more for some of the weapons. 
---
TLDR the best way to improve workshop pvp is remove it from adventure mode completely and give the handicapped their own pvp server to go be dumb on with each other. they need to bring back survival mode yesterday.

I completely understand your love for this game. I bought it over the weekend and I'm having a great time.
---
I would like half walls, half ceilings, half foundations, etc. 
---
Also we need planters and glass walls for greenhouses. 
---
Also daily log-in rewards. Heck monthly log-in rewards while we‚Äôre at it. 
---
And how come the built-in switch on the Decontamination Arch doesn‚Äôt work like it did fo4? 
---
Wall-mounted turret stands would be need. Heck what about giving us those wall mounted bubble turrets?
---
Preach.
---
Gunpowder - Supers, I suggest the lumber yard on the river north or west tek areas
---
Lead - Cans, all the cans. Or weights if I‚Äôm feeling froggy
---
Steel - Scrapper perk on weapons and all the kitchen items players often ignore
---
Find can chimes for tons of lead. The monorail elevation has a fair bit too. Drop a tent down below and take the dive with your PA on.
---
Brick fireplace, decoratable Christmas trees and Christmas Wreath (cannot place it on a door however) were in fallout 4's creation club.
---
It might  be very easy for them to just implement those items into 76. 
---
Hope we'll see them very soon :D
---
they wont change a thing. this was stated 1000 times already and nothing changed. ppl still grief the f\*\*k out of ppl that just want to play adventure..1000 times ppl said "pls remove the pvp from adventure...its useless and not fun at all" \*silence\* 
---
...its Fo76 so you better get used to it. the devs focus on releasing content rather than fixing the pile of crap they created faster

So like gta online
---
You forget that Bethesda doesn‚Äôt listen to suggestions unless it can be monitozed in some way.
---
Original, im sure your mommy is proud of you little buddy.
---
Wow that's really small dick energy.
---
There's actually a brick fireplace in the game files.
---
Haha, that's good idea! üòÅ
---
Lol I thought the same thing.. The idea and it does remind me of GTA. That said, it would add a weather aspect besides just rain or the occasional nuclear storm.. Haha maybe a mutated yeti boss.. Idk im just spitballing.. I do know that part of the US gets its fair amount of snow..
---
I've said this many times:
---
Add a 10 second delay before pvp begins when you claim an owned workshop.
---
Dude, those huge fonts and bars! It‚Äôs like looking in a large-print book! So obnoxious.
---
The ncr outfit is the first months reward so it may be that next month they do a different variant of the ncr Ranger armor but yeah it‚Äôs temporary. And they likely won‚Äôt lower the price. The 1st subscription is established for the new playerbase wastelanders will bring. They were meant to coincide in release but 1st wasn‚Äôt delayed... they won‚Äôt lower the price
---
Stop crying little, stinky, filthy dog:)
---
Happening to me on xbox
---
no, that's life with dillweed toxic players.  This isn't PvE, it's PvP
---
I'm certain there will be like, %25 off this month, type stuff  
---
Most games with paid subscriptions do this all the time
---
I said come in, don't stand there!
---
No.  If you want to see snow come to my house soemwhere in Wisconsin and shovel the whole damn block.  Fallout is frozen in Halloween.
---
That was pretty fun for races.
---
Do we have any stats the sales exceeded expectations? I believe it- seems everyone and their uncle got it. I just want to be able to show that to people
---
I use a Gatling laser that‚Äôs vampire- I never die or need stims. I can take the full laser blast from the sheep robot while being activated on all three beacons 
---
My build is built around that tho (power armour etc)
---
Ok, cool. Thanks again
---
Idk I haven‚Äôt read up on it too much but I know their statement was that monthly sales and yearly sub sales both crushed their projections which doesn‚Äôt surprise me. The game gets a lot of negative feedback but the people who like it really love it and I am one of them. Bought a monthly but I would‚Äôve but a year if I could‚Äôve afford the upfront.
---
You wouldn't be banned for doing it once. It's people who do it over and over maliciously and get reported time and time again by different, unrelated players who would get banned. "What if I accidentally did it once!?!? I shouldn't be banned!", is not a good argument. 
---
And the best way to deal with it is just to patch mines to stop them detonating if they don't detect a HOSTILE target. Right now they go off when they get in range of anyone other than the person who set it, which is why you can use them to kill non-hostile players.
---
To do the Railroad badge, you have to visit all the stations as well as the repair yards. 
---
So I walked from Grafton Station all the way to Big Bend Tunnel West. I *could* have gone through the tunnel, but instead I crossed overland to R&amp;G Station and walked north all the way to Sunnytop Station. Then I ran (a lot) down to Berkeley Springs Station and followed the line to Harpers Ferry and back out again. 
---
Next I had to run down to the Flooded Trainyard and then walked it back to Big Bend Tunnel. 
---
It was a LONG walk. For the badge you have to kill a number of enemies in the railyards, and that was a bit time consuming if there wasn't enough spawns around so I had to wait until the enemies respawned.
---
I‚Äôm the same way I love the game and got the monthly- no regrets. Super excited for wasteland
---
I always put Nukashine in my punch bowl, but only 1/10 so it's an actual game of chance. I like having a full assortment of different drinks in there!
---
A watched developer never boils?
---
It's very easy to get em actually. Crank up you Luck stats using chems/armor/food, etc and keep retrying. It takes a few tries but higher you Luck stat the higher the chance to  get that tasty thing.
---
Another idiot who doesn't bother to read. You can't fast travel, take rad-away, or even REACT if someone chucks one of these at you while you are in a workbench, or trade menu, or your pip-boy. You don't have the time to do anything about it before you are dead.
---
You don't own the event, dumbass. If you want to milk a event, go to a private server. The majority overrules you.
---
Amen! Everything it does is divisive but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs goin to change till wastelanders and even then it‚Äôs going to take some time for the old culture to assimilate with the new and who knows maybe wastelanders isn‚Äôt as positive or popular as I expect it to be but I think it‚Äôs going to basically revitalize this game
---
Ears were dropped from PvP in the original Diablo.
---
As others have said, this is far from the ideal heavy weapons build. I'm sure it works OK, but I wouldn't use it as a guide.
---
Well, the guy that tried it on you was bad at it. People who know what they are doing wait till you are at a workbench, in a trade menu, or using your map/Pip-Boy. You don't have time to react before you die in most cases. They also don't get a bounty for killing you, which they should. And this could easily be patched by making it so mines don't detect and explode on non-hostile targets, which is why this trick even works in the first place.
---
If you're on PC: open the command console and type:
---
setgs fJumpHeightMin¬†288
---
I haven't tested it, but it should be exactly the same bonus as Marsupial.
---
Yet another boomer in the wasteland. GO TO PRIVATE SERVERS, AINT THAT WHAT YOU ASKED FOR FOOD BUILD?
---
What about lag based god mode
---
As soon as they pushed it back that solidified my belief it‚Äôs going to revitalize the game. They are putting real effort in and I appreciate it
---
They no longer drop from enemies, only the chest at the end of the V94 raid.
---
No computer, no junk, more sells.
---
That 25k pie is not for selling is for showing.
---
I have 10 nukashines in my bowl since they fixed it and they are still all there. I already got a couple of WTF moment visiting others' camps.
---
Serums are under ‚ÄúAid‚Äù
---
As much as I've personally said that just copying ESO's subscription model isn't a good idea, that seems to be exactly what they've done here.
---
It probably won't go on sale or become cheaper because the atoms provide a base value. They'll increase the number of atoms given per month rather than lowering the value of the subscription if necessary as ESO has done. The discount available to players is in the form of the one year subscription they offer.
---
Honestly, I put hard lemonade in mine. It is in front for my mothman shrine though, so I figured that it was fitting.
---
Scrip it, then it's useful
---
Mutations are the key. Without them your damage output will suffer
---
I think it's [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dhco2s/master_thread_for_the_dataminer_ama_oct_13th/).
---
I hope so. I don‚Äôt have a negative impression of the company but that‚Äôs what scares me. I don‚Äôt want to be left the fool if it isn‚Äôt grand!  Although I do also worry that if it flops we won‚Äôt see much more content added to this game idk. I‚Äôm worried they‚Äôd give up on it at that point. I‚Äôm still thinking it‚Äôll be great don‚Äôt get me wrong but I worry that I may be too blind to see the writing on the wall
---
I will also love the company- they brought fallout back! There is only so many times I could play fallout two over and over. They will always have my love
---
I never played the old ones but I‚Äôll never forget the day I came to my buddies house and he had picked up es4 and f3. That was life changing! Realized what I really loved about video games with those titles. Been playing games years before that but him finding those games showed me what games really could be
---
Nope, read the comments in that thread. Dataminers proved that the customer support rep was incorrect.
---
Honestly try the old ones- fallout one first than two- they are turn based but the story is insane. I think you can get them for cheap on steam.
---
I enjoyed the brother hood of steel tactics game but I can see why some don‚Äôt like it. 
---
Fallout one and two are a must tho- be apart of what made the NCR. Knock up a gangsters daughter. So much to do. 
---
Grow a extra toe.
---
I might have one, if you are on PS4 DM me.  I'll check my inventory when I login again.
---
Cream pies? Sometimes my gf gets more than two per day...
---
Hahahaha that check list is ridiculous! üòÇ
---
A nuke mine only puts down about 3 to 5 rads per sec for maybe 30 ish seconds.  Unless you are very low level you are not going to get killed by a nuke mine's rads regardless of where you are.  Anyone above level 50ish has radaway or something similar on a favorite button for SBQ quests.
---
Now workshops are another matter entirely and no one is going to waste a nuke mine on you there when you can get killed far more easily with a better weapon.  With that said, in 7 -8 months of playying a lot (too much) I've only been griefed at a workshop  3 or 4 times tops.
---
Usually if get a fast pop up 6 or so times, then get nothing around the same. Usually have to exit a room or run around a bit to get it to work... Just the other day I had the timer start only to go away when it hit "1" 3 times!
---
&gt; Go to another vending machine. If a go-to response to waiting is to be violent to someone else, that‚Äôs kinda sad.
---
Yeah.  And some people are just impatient neanderthals.  I've had people start attacking me because they wanted on a vendor.  I wasn't AFK, I was looking through things.  Try to remember the things you learned in Kindergarten people.  Take turns.
---
Fallout 76 is mainly a PVE setting (though it does have a separate Nuclear Winter PVP mode).  Starting late will not effect your game experience.
---
After 1000+ hours on the game (PC) I don‚Äôt experience game-breaking bugs.  That‚Äôs not to say that there aren‚Äôt bugs.  Generally, you start noticing bugs after you reach the end-game and they become relevant for players who min/max and for PVP.
---
Is it a first server?
---
But if it is a new character how will I get the caps for the serums
---
There is one feature they presented in 76 that i just really miss now in every other game. Fotomode loading screens. 
---
I simply love it and hope they put it at least as an option in all future games :)
---
Some rare outfits like the responder fireman uniform can drop from it.
---
Yeah i feel similarly although im still able to play Fallout 4 without issue. Well, not those issues anyways.
---
Fallout 4 is pretty lackluster in terms of everything
---
I don't know what toy are on about but you don't get an option to seek revenge if you get killed with a bounty.  
---
So you already got your wish. Kill anyone with a bounty and they can't do anything about it.
---
You should just play hunter/hunted. Works almost identical to your idea.
---
On the Map they are listed as misc, at the vendor as aid.
---
Yeah, all the time. They trash my camp completely. Leaving them boken until next patch.
---
Must say, quite happy I haven't found the plans for missile turrets yet.
---
I agree with a lot of your points:
---
\- They need to push a reset button on the player economy, player power levels, and itemization. Legacies need to go the way of the dodo, weapons/armor/perks/consumables need to be balanced a lot better (and continuously balanced week to week, or within days if an exploit is found), and there needs to be a better way to target desired items as there will always be some weapons slightly better than others.
---
\- They need to make it easier to gain power at lower levels, but they need to give higher level players a progression system that helps them in other ways than just pure power. Give people a fighting chance while giving high levels other ways to progress.
---
\- PvP itself needs a designated design think through. Raiders vs settlers oriented game modes is the obvious approach, but it would be cool if workshop PvP also alerted members of your faction to help you out. I like that workshops are meant to be high risk high reward scenarios with valuable resources, but as you mentioned a high level player doesn't need them that much whereas the lower level players do. Would be great if that was flipped: if there were more places like Lucky Hole Mine that give all the base resources lower level wastelanders need, leaving workshops for the high levels who need to craft stuff like 25k 50 cal ammo and 100 Ultracite fusion cores.
---
GTA style, pay to set a bounty.
---
I love Frozen! KBell is a smoke show.
---
After coming back from Bethesda games after a few months (playing Skyrim in secret with my 10yr nephew from his parents) I‚Äôm so greatful, it‚Äôs so smooth, so creative, such community
---
You can just buy them from other players for like 200 caps lol
---
For me F4 was ruined because I couldn't buy game advantages anymore. 
---
Plus I was so used to the game being shit, that a halfway decent one completely irritated me.
---
It's mostly a weight management thing when you're on the road, or at least that's how I'd use it. It also means you can keep essential parts you may need and dump all the junk you don't (e.g. steel) to make your overall haul more efficient.
---
In vanilla Fallout 4, outside of settlements you can breakdown armour and weapons but only at their respective workbenches and junk can only be broken down once used.
---
There isn't THAT much of a point once you get back to base to break junk down other than keeping your storage lists shorter and easier to manage.
---
Don't lmao
---
That sounds even more cheaty!
---
All I'd really like is the ability to use workbenches like in 76 and nothing more. Breakdown weapons and armour on any station and break down junk so you can reduce weight and dump any unneeded junk as well.
---
I'm surprised that no one has made a mod that emulates that feature in 76 yet.
---
Plasma
---
I farm SBQ pretty regularly, so im loosing ammo, and gaining flux. I also try to trade for fluxes.
---
I started playing it again
---
Get you Luck stat as high as you can using chems/food/armor and keep retrying. I got one in about 4 tries.
---
Saw a video a while back where they used shelves stacked upon one another to surround the workshop so as to make it impossible to click on it to try to take it.
---
He made a blueprint of three shelves stacked on each other, then went from there.
---
That vid amused me greatly.
---
As someone who hasn‚Äôt played 76 I can say that I think I‚Äôd like the VATS in 76 more than Fallout 4. When I play run and gun players I like to always be moving, so in fallout 4 when time slows down I don‚Äôt like it.
---
I can meet online tonight?
---
Cheeki Breeki Stalker
---
I really enjoy the always online with friends part of 76. I really hope they make online play at least an option in Fallout 5. Going back to Fallout 4 the world feels so dead and empty in comparison.
---
Oof. Unless there is a SERIOUS issue with long term monetisation like the month-to-month retention drops off to a fraction that it currently is, it'll either remain the same or go up, due to inflation or "added value".
---
The best you're going to get is that they might throw in some more free useless tat to bump up the apparent value. Extra coloured skins of the same thing, maybe some icons, that kind of shit.
---
i once protected a workshop by putting down 20 turrets, was quite an investment but i did kill some lvl 200+ thank to it, i was lvl 40-50 at the time 
---
but just keep checking the map for yellow dots nearby and make it difficult for players to reach the red workshop thing
---
30% bonus dmg vs mirelurks 
---
30% bonus dmg vs ghouls 
---
i get those the most from purveyor
---
1) No change. Players need to read the message when they claim a workshop acknowledging they are opening themselves up to PvP. 
---
Although even if you are in the workshop area but haven't claimed the workshop, someone else can still claim and shoot you if the enemies are cleared. 
---
2) Mark Workshops as PvP free fire zones with no restrictions. Give everyone a popup when they enter the zone to warn them. So that means if you enter the zone, you are definitely consenting to PvP. 
---
3) Have a countdown timer when another player contests the workshop where the owner has a chance to get out of the zone if they don't want to engage in PvP. 
---
Personally I think that players should just understand that workshops are PvP zones and if you're in it, no matter who owns it, you're at risk.
---
Power armor sucks lmao, my aae handmade could one tap them
---
The only way PvP can be improved is if we get separate PvE and PvP stats on weapons, armor and perks. The division gets it right most of the time and i think its a good system.
---
i kinda wish you could play the game without fps drops on ps4
---
No
---
Lucky
---
While a .50 hunting rifle does, indeed, do marginally more damage per shot than a lever action, you pay for this with a markedly lower rate of fire (3 instead of 5 shots in 10 seconds), more weight, and a much longer reload time when doing partial reloads. Not worth it, in my opinion.
---
All you need is weapons and armour, don‚Äôt worry about the hats and pie. That shit won‚Äôt get you anywhere in this game.
---
He sure doesn't like the utility items either :)
---
I hope they raise the price, take advantage of all the idiots.....
---
The less you suck, the easier it is.
---
Seems to me that the hats and pies might be good for ones cap balance though, and caps equals better gear. ;)
---
Mostly the dragon, and certain shotguns. Maybe the broadsider.....
---
RNG.
---
Id love it if they didnt intorduce anything that will break the fuck out of the game. It already cant handle simple tasks like stash navigation or the weapon wheel. Rain just freezes still on the screen. I see adding snow just adding to the rampant freezes and crahses
---
Make it disappear from the pool so other prefixes have more chance üëå
---
250 is a bargain. 300 to 400 is ok. More than that is a rip off.
---
The problem is without a net negative cap sink, this would be rife for exploits, similar to how the current bounty system is.
---
Even the old suggestion that someone could place a bounty onto someone else could still be exploited. Just have a friend stand by and as soon as that bounty is placed, take it and then share the cut.
---
It'd have to have heavy restrictions like you can only get a bounty from the same person only once or a player with a large enough bounty is knocked out of the game for a set period of time or something heavily restricted like that so even if you were going to exploit it, you couldn't make that many caps per day than just playing the game normal.
---
Perfectly preserved pies are a dime a dozen. Not really worth anything.
---
It just works....
---
The biggest issue with bounties is that most wanted players are just acting as bait so their high level friends can gank you when you try to collect the bounty. The whole team becoming hostile is such a dumb mechanic that I don't even bother going after wanted players anymore.
---
I'd wait until at least a couple of weeks after the Wastelanders DLC launches before even buying the game.
---
Not worth getting into the game right now.
---
Power armour blows, and you need a good gun.
---
I like using nukashine if I am too overencumbered for fast travel to get out of a building too.
---
I dunno jade they have been making changes. 
---
they removed slap damage. 
---
they nerfed TSE. 
---
they removed cross map sniping. 
---
They made camps invulnerable. 
---
I think their next progression may be to reopen survival mode and then just put a put a cap on how many shops you can own in adventure. 
---
Of course that will be a year from now at the rate they're going. 
---
thats ok when I need to farm workshops now I just go to private anyway.
---
Get rid of it.
---
since i got my 2 star bloodied mg50 vats improved i rarely use any other weapon, its shredding anything but the queen with ease.
---
if you can deal with the hp/rad management of a bloodied build you will love it. 
---
if you go heavy non bloody i highly recommend a vampire mg50 or gatling.
---
The nuka shine found you not worthy.
---
Are you dumb? It is pathetically easy to max out on caps everyday, do uranium fever or clear out west tek take all the weapons and sell
---
One thing 4 did better was weapon selection... I still struggle with the wepon wheel in '76
---
Settlement building is my favorite feature in F4 so I'd love for the 76 workshop UI to be ported to F4. Such a big improvement...
---
Are you on now?
---
That fix is working actually, but the gatling energy weapons are still weak.
---
It‚Äôs happened to me a lot the only thing that fixed for me was restarting the game.
---
Yeah, leave world and close app. Its kinda scary not seeing what your doing. Always afraid ill drop something impostant.
---
Loved that game and it's what got me into Fallout
---
76 has a lot of work to do as far as PvP is concerned.  It‚Äôs pretty obvious that they were naive and didn‚Äôt really have much experience in that style of play.  It works fine if two level 10 characters are duking it out with vanilla pipe rifles, but not so well when one guy has all the gear and knows where the holes in the system are.  Nuclear Winter nails the fun of the pipe rifle situation, but players also want to show off their best, most powerful stuff.  Survival mode was supposed to be that place, but I guess BGS was not interested in making their version of RUST.
---
As a historically single play experience, Fallout characters have always developed into the apex predator of the landscape, especially if you opt to min/max. This creates so many problems when you add three star legendary gear into the mix.
---
In 76 pvp, this causes two situations.  One is that 99% of the time a developed, geared min/max character will absolutely smoke a low to mid level character, as well as unoptimized high levels.  Two, a high level duel between min/maxers results in the classic samurai tale scenario, where the battle is over instantly once someone makes the first move.  Or if you prefer, a two hit scenario where he hits you and you hit the floor.
---
Because of this, adventure mode pvp just needs to be unrestricted and have an arena where all actors are hostile the instant they step in bounds.  It doesn‚Äôt solve the power gap situation, but at least the player has to make a conscious decision to participate.  
---
Workshops kinda fill that role, but they also serve other purposes depending on a player‚Äôs style.  It creates frustration, because PvP Joe wants you to come at him bro, and PvE Simon just wants to mine some acid.  There needs to be dedicated PvP areas that serve no other purpose.  Think of it like the city building a skatepark, so the skateboarders stop waxing and chipping the planters at the local high school.
---
Survival wasn‚Äôt popular enough to warrant dedicated servers, and Bethesda kept ruining it with damage caps and other governors in an attempt to level the playing field. What they didn‚Äôt realize is that hardcore pvp players don‚Äôt want a level playing field.  They want to build hot rods and race for pink slips.  They want a high stakes game, and nerfing down pvp was kinda like your mom forcing you to take your baby sister along to play with your friends.
---
As it is now, workshop contests are the only place for players to flex their pvp builds.  The system is not ideal, and creates a situation where the attacker has the ability to initiate the conflict and usually has the element of surprise.  PvP folks obviously like the game and put time and resources behind their character, so they have every right to enjoy the game the way they like to play it.  For now, that means workshops.
---
I just avoid workshops for the most part. For now pretend it‚Äôs a PvP zone, not a place to gather resources.  I‚Äôm guessing that pvp will get another look once Wastelanders is established and the largest bugs are bandaged up.  Instead of setting up the Munions Factory to make ammo, go to Lucky Hole, mine lead and make it at home.  Workshops don‚Äôt provide anything that can‚Äôt be found elsewhere.
---
U on?
---
Events! Nearly all events give you water, food and stimpaks. 
---
Apart from that there are perk cards which let you find extra stims or food or ammo...
---
And of course exploration. 
---
If you are on PC and ever get stuck on sth or beaten to death over and over drop me a pm and i'll help you out :)
---
Well my psn plus just ran out a few days ago so I am playing fallout 4 right now but it does seem weirder I keep pressing pause for map but I need to be on pip boy plus I do like how it the hidden and danger sign looks smoother on fallout 76 but I like how you can change the hud color of your interface and pip boy screen on fallout 4,  I wish they would add that on 76.

Oh, its been like nearly a year since I last claimed one so I didn't know they changed it xD
---
Nukashine, a free beam-me-up beverage ;)
---
Its been nearly I year since I last claimed one so I didn't know they removed that. Fair enough though xD
---
The frat house basement jukebox is so cool :D
---
I went back to 4 yesterday because I wanted to build, and I don't want to play 76 until there's wastelander.
---
Damn you, the build interface is so crappy compared to 76 :/ you HAVE to push enter to scrap/store something, you need to move inside the menu with the arrows, it's clunky as hell.
---
But you know, there's like three times more optiosn to build, and you can build in multiple places without paying a fuckin subscription, and there are so many mods I can have a game that really suits me. 
---
:/
---
I go with 6 Nukashine, 2 Lead Champagne &amp; 2 Hard Lemonade. 
---
It's fine.  It's all fine.
---
This is mainly why I made this post. Most people already renewed and if you dint save it, a special may go live out of the blue on that day.
---
It is what it is. Sometimes you lose and sometimes you win.
---
simple solution. give the workshop owner the first shot and not the attacker (which is crazy to begin with) 
---
problem solved
---
Works like a charm! Thx!
---
They go in order
---
1. Dead in the water

2. Melt down

3. Washout

I believe its still in meltdown, moving into washout today/tomorrow

Does your Crossbow or Railway Rifle have a Prime Receiver?
---
I switch them off all the time when shopping. How people can have that same song playing OVER and OVER and OVER without going insane is beyond me.
---
I remember high level players taking over my workshops... I was mad but I kept going, leveling up and exploring.
---
Now, I'm level 140 and taking over workshop from me is not easy.
---
Thing is, people nowadays want everything NOW, they are too spoiled.
---
Not to mention the melee combat. Bethesda really improved that in F76.
---
Melee combat in F4 was atrocious, a tedious slug of endless stunlocks. In F76, its smooth, fast and responsive.
---
I knew I couldn't be the only one!
---
Join our cause brothers - of sneaking into people's camps and turning off their jukeboxes! For the sanity of Appalachia!
---
Thanks :)
---
Figured it would be worth selling to the bots. For player trades, it seems like the word "clean" is something to be looking for?
---
Managed to find a bunch of useful threads around here, will try to compile a list to get started once I get home and can access a computer.
---
I think people have reported it's like 2-3 percent. I have a was handmade and I only get stuff off her if the fight lasts more than 5 minutes or so, best if it takes 8 or more. Also, while I never do it otherwise, take chems like psychotats. I pop them twice per fight. It helps a lot.
---
I will have to contest that. I play a bloodied "glass cannon stealth rifleman" type of build and by now  i tested every weapon in the game, the lever action fall FAR behind the gauss. Both weapons have the same magazine capacity of 5 shots. Both weapons have indistinguishable fire rate (with the gauss firing fully charged shots) of around 1 shot per second. Both weapons have indistinguishable ap usage in vats. The only difference is that the lever action does half of the damage of the gauss.
---
Ive tested both side by side since i own a 2* BE max lvl version of both.
---
The gauss also has the advantage that you can tap fire without charging for some extra quick consecutive shots which gives it more flexibility on close quarters. 
---
I would also argue that the ammo for the gauss is cheaper to craft since you get alot of it and it only uses 2 mats (or 3 if ultracite)
---
Nah, up the dmg to +50-80% against players. PVErs won't care, PVPers will finally use them.
---
plus tincan-traps in cellblock A. great loot place.
---
Why thought you hit the damage cap with 10% anyway
---
Please Bethesda start with the little things. I'm sick of classical music.
---
But workshops can be taken from anywhere within the perimeter; been like that for several months now.
---
This is so sad...
---
Gauss has the most damage for a long range rifle in the game by far. It is not even fair to compare the lever to it.
---
Both have the same magazine size, fire rate and ap usage..the only difference is that the lever does half of the dmg of the gauss rifle.
---
I agree!
---
You on PS4? I'm looking for both of these for raid weapons
---
Also golf costumes (30 caps I think ?), ranger costumes etc. I usually pick up all clothing really, as clothing items only weigh 0.1 (not counting under-armor etc) they are really good value for weight. Just keep collecting them and load them off once in a while for some decent caps.
---
Are you guys planning on paywalling fast travel? Maybe it‚Äôs all these plebeians abusing it that‚Äôs making it malfunction
---
Problem Solvers: 
---
1. Uninstall the game 
---
2. don‚Äôt play it anymore 
---
3. Find another game to play 
---
4. stop your crying and DEAL WITH IT BOOMER
---
I wonder if it's something to do with the server thinking there's an enemy there, but it's not visible to you?
---
I've been shot by invisible mobs on first servers, the video looked like they were targeting something, not just camp items.
---
Personally I Will never accept 556 as a currency
---
I would love to see any game with weekly season changes that significantly impact gameplay.
---
Happens in workshops too. Turrets targeting extractors and whatever else you‚Äôve built.
---
You shouldn't be able to pay to avoid the weight limit. Empty your stash like everybody else
---
üëé
---
Yeah. We ran on average 3 a day, getting all four members to the G.E.C.K. room about 1 of them. The instancing tech is in major need of a patch, but that's why I spoke about the fundamentals, not the present reality
---
Use the jet pack mod by niero
---
Its so prevalent for a number of reason. Handmades were duped to hell, handmades are one of the best rifles, when you find 556 in the world its generally a pretty small amount, like you said the convenience of it all being stacked up together. Gold would never replace ammo because its hardly used. The desire for 556 comes from the fact that it is used and caps are nearly worthless.
---
i couldnt finish or even just play a single vault raid yet (ever!) because of frameratedrops, lags, crashes and basic unstable gameplay (ps4)
---
its not fun so i wont attempt any of them anymore.
---
thats why im glad to get some insight into the gameplay here i cannot enjoy myself.
---
Pfft I use a handmade and I don't use commando but rifleman. It's my go to weapon if I'm facing multiple enemies my lever action can't kill with 5 shots.
---
My first impression sucked.
---
I did it for the first time the other day just to collect acid. Tried solo without power armour, bloodied, relentlessly killing the never ending mobs. I rage quit as soon as I got the engineering door open because by that point I didnt even want the acid. Rads weren't too bad honestly I was just annoyed
---
A couple days after that I tried with a friend who also had never been. Power armour, ghoulish and rad sponge with enforcer, instead of unyielding sneaking bloodied rifle. The ghouls dont keep spawning if you cripple them all which was so freaking nice. Killing the insects took a while from full hp tho so I ended up letting myself drop down to 30% hp so I could one hit power attack everything.
---
I'm my friends source of ammo so they gave me their acid, which in addition to mine, after only 2 runs of the engineering wing, I now have about 1600 acid.
---
Will be doing it every time I see meltdown now. I dont care for the power armour rewards much so I wont be completing the raids fully though
---
So that explains its rise as a currency, but why fix it to the cap as a 1:1 currency? If it costs more than a cap to make and ffr is so valuable and increases consumption those would both be factors that normally would increase the price. Unless possibly the price was below one cap before and the fix was to make it universally one cap so people could actually buy and sell it (when prices are too far out of alignment most trades cannot complete).
---
Just curious if there is anyone out there creating 556 just to act as a currency? Or whetherit would crash if certain weapons go out of favor?
---
Sorry, a lot of handmade users :)
---
Usually when I get wanted because I picked a lock for a normal spawned container that I didn't notice was in someone's camp boundary. I then usually have to search out someone and ask them to kill me and get rid of it.
---
Holy shit! Someone else on this sub has common sense. Does your opinion stem from bethesda saying the atomic shop would be purely cosmetic and new mechanics added to the game would be free?
---
It was shot by a 556 bullet!
---
Gold is just an example I am promoting as an alternative currency. Mostly for its simple conversion process to caps and low likelyhood it will be consumed in mass quantities or crash if related products fail.
---
Is 556 the new tulip industry?
---
I am mostly stirring up controversy as an intellectual exercise, I still sell 556 for one cap in my shop but I do not accept it 1-1. I treat it more like a good.
---
Change camp location...
---
l think because of its popularity it will rise in value
---
Yeahhhh, now if only the pipe repairs would track so i could actually complete a standard mode run.
---
If you want to join a novice run, jumping into private I'd say we have a good chance.
---
My psn is dtb7591. Probably starting in 20
---
Apparently so XD
---
In Fallout 4 Diamond City had Christmas decorations.  I would love to see it snow in game.
---
Well said!
---
Yes. In fact it does
---
This was extremely well written and covered every point I could thing of. Someone ought to tag the bethesda ppl to see this but I dont see any of them post or comment enough to remember their usernames
---
Isn‚Äôt there more than one spawn point?
---
It specifies players. I wonder if they're going to change it to humans when wastelanders releases.
---
I PvP regularly in this game. I can inform you that the reason workshop fights and the similar is a thing is because the game has no way to find PvP. I usually have to waste thousands of caps a day in fast travel cost going around punching people to see if they wanna fight. That and server hopping again and again and again... that Is really boring with all the time and resources you have to waste, so if you see a chance for PvP you take it. 
---
Your point with the insane guns ruining PvP, well... doesn't bloody builds ruin PvE? Or, people worked hard to get their stuff. We all started out with the same. If they Want to use their guns, why not? If you run into a guy spamming tesla, counter it with a full heavy leather set and a few chems. If a guy uses vats on you counter it with a stealth boy. Maybe not as simple as that, but what I'm trying to say is don't shout at people for wanting to use their gear C:
---
What platform you on?
---
Ps4
---
So far I had him spawn in twice the first time a player killed him after he was done and I was waiting and the second time he had 2 sets of the same fisherman outfit which sucked
---
Iv had better luck getting him at janets soft serve north of 76. Spawn there then go down the hill to the Jeep.
---
yep and apparently they don't like collectrons either :P
---
Is the same one bc all I want is the coat
---
Add me gr25mcd il give you the coat for free, wont be on for an hour tho
---
Same guy. Buts still random if he has it on him or not.
---
another thing to note.. a lot of players who trade 5.56 1:1 will consider the same for other more prevalent bullets.. .45, fusion cells, 50Cal, it‚Äôs more of a convenient replacement for Caps.. than a strict new currency we must all use. 5.56 is by far the most commonly used ammo then .45, unless we ever see a rise in caps, I think we‚Äôll continue to use these as a replacements it‚Äôs just convenient.. 
---
Alternatively if we see a rise in .45 guns in wastelanders, we very may well see a shift to .45 being the ammo most commonly traded 
---
But another note is that ammo is one of the only things that keeps Caps relevant late game.. after a certain point there‚Äôs nothing else to buy, or the stuff you do want to buy requires a high amount of caps not possible in the game.. so we get ammo.
---
It is not just 5.56 used as the currency it is a lot of ammo types, we just tend to prefer 5.56 as a community, that is always subject to change!
---
Just get a troubleshooter armor set and a melee weapon. I don't shoot a single bullet at enemies in the silos.
---
K I‚Äôm bugxbones. I don‚Äôt mind waiting an hour it‚Äôs 4am rn and I‚Äôve been trying since 11pm. I‚Äôm just watch king of the hill while it loads new server. Also I went hard bc it‚Äôs my only day off this week
---
It goes into your stash as well
---
To add: radiation is doable. Poison will outright kill you as a Bloodied build.
---
Same, for me 556 is just another ammo type that has it's value, but I would never treat it as alternative currency. For me alternative way of trade, when I'm closing to full caps on every character are violet fluxes - they're heavy, but worth 100+ caps and if you're 1st you can store in the scrap box.
---

check out the drummsticks at the power substation north of watoga (teddy in shack)
---
banjo on porch and another guitar across the field at aaronholt homestead 
---
hornwright estates also has a flute (its wall mounted in one room) and a steel drum in a display case near billardtable
---
If that's what bothers you most about this game, then it can't be that bad
---
I added you I don‚Äôt mind waiting
---
Serums are becoming (bulked) caps for me. they sell for 440 with hb 3 and I spread them out amongst my alts. I probably have enough to hit max cap for the next ten days. they're light and they can sit on my player vendor for sale when I am waiting on vendors to reset. 
---
My goal is to eventually have 1 of each at minimum on my vendor at all times but I am still buying recipes. 
---
each queen kill gives enough mats for 3 to 5 serums. 
---
all ammo go to the vendor for 1 c per 
---
all meds go to vendor for 5 c per. 
---
all legendary's vendor for whatever the price displays as when I drop em even the good ones. 
---
I guess after I get ll the serum recipes I will start buying out all unkown plans from all vendors. then I dont know what I will do with cps .
---
The games been out a year and people still don‚Äôt know this.. I personally boycott everyone‚Äôs vendor at Charleston station, mainly because 99% of the time.. if they don‚Äôt know about the vendor.. they usually have a bad vendor themselves ü§£
---
 Holy fuck go play fallout 4 if you don't want to socialize
---
Why should multiple people change the way they play for you? The sense of self importance you have is way to high.
---
I think simply the puzzles are what puts people off doing them, I‚Äôm struggling to find a team other then the couriers, everyone  including myself , I‚Äôve met either does not understand the seed bank/ pump station or mainframe part, it does not help there is not a lot of guidance, 
---
I‚Äôm on 3/3 runs at the moment, one per difficulty, and enjoy what the raid offer, when I get a team that can help me, I got the vault 94 scout or Forrest mask and love it, just trying to grind the vault steel
---
not only that but the spawn will often draw aggro from the turrets while fighting the robots and then the turrets will hit the robots. then the sentry bots and assaultrons wreck all lol. thats one reason why I moved away from whitespring, also lag, blech F whitespring.
---
Did you get the Unstoppable Monster from survival? That‚Äôs a decent unarmed weapon.
---
Hey guys what's the current PS4 size for fallout 76? Including all the later patches,etc
---
Right, they should just eliminate people from putting CAMPS anywhere on premises
---
Ye but These are Problems only if you have pvp enabled.....without pvp this is stuff NPCs you encountered do in any bethesda game. Only pvp makes those exploits unbearable. So the Main question is why they still dont listen to the adventure community, which is the biggest, rather than fullfilling idea of adventure
---
You will like this one, if you aren't too into the story or people interaction. If you like exploring and fighting, you'll love it.
---
oh it is possible to buy it for one month and cancellation actually works? on ps4?
---
good to know i wanted to try for a month but was unsure if that was even possible
---
I hate it too, but it doesn't look that bad after all. I can live with it.
---
For me the [wrapped cap](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wrapped_cap_(Fallout_4)) is 100x times worse. Not only removes your hair, removes all your facial hair also. Makes look your character face really weird.
---
Change location? Just a thought.
---
There is no cap on how much 556 you can carry. That's the big draw for me.
---
&gt; bolstering for low health build
---
You mean Bloodied (weapon prefix) or Unyielding (armor prefix).
---
Bolstering is low damage resistance, not low health.
---
Man i wish more people understood this.
---
Haha, I've hit the jackpot with that outfit. I wasn't even looking for it, but when I saw it drop I said: "well, I will have to give it some use"
---
You can hold more than max caps of it, and it's easy to get rid of for caps, so it's a store of value.
---
&gt;Frozen in Halloween
---
We're already getting a Christmas event so...
---
Also it can snow in October
---
Errm, you bemoan the possibility that crafting 5.56 mm ammo creates an end product that may be less valuable than the source materials and then propose gold as an improved alternative where that difference is even more pronounced and the loss in value is absolutely assured both in crafting (acid is valuable both for players and at vendors) and in scrapping? Seriously?!
---
Also, as long as caps are mostly useless, the possibility to convert a player currency to caps is really, really not an issue. And should caps become useful as an actual currency, you can convert 5.56 ammo to caps at a far better rate though a slower process (through looting the corpses you shoot with it) than you could gold.
---
Anyway, 5.56 mm is \*the\* established alternative currency for player-to-player trading in this game. There are circumstances where that might change, e.g. all guns using 5.56 mm being nerfed to the ground, thus tanking the use-value of 5.56 ammo (which is what this currency is essentially backed by), or Bethesda fixing the stupid restrictions for caps that made the creation of an alternative currency a necessity in the first place. But outside of that there is really no reason to switch.
---
BTW, the tulip market in the Netherlands crashed because it was a bubble backed by nothing but endless speculation. With 5.56 ammo, I can see neither a much of a bubble nor a whole lot of speculation. It simply works as a currency because it has all the desired properties of a currency to a sufficient degree.
---

Also fuck Bethesda. No one cares about this "community"

It started doing this a couple months ago
---
oof that title, he acts like anyone gives 2 shits about what critics think anymore, afterall critics said cuphead was to hard, and the new CoD was to realistic.
---
i personally dont give a shit what some nobody thinks, i know there is still a bunch of bugs but i still can have fun.
---
Personally I like to use Unarmed. Your death claw gauntlet is a great start, perfect roll is a bloodied swing speed +1 str, or maybe +power attack damage if you want to get the hardest hits. 
---
The Deathclaw Gauntlet, Powerfist, and Meat Hook can match or outdo 2h damage and because Iron Fist is just 3* that gives you room to use 3* Barbarian, Blocker, Martial Artist, and Incisor.
---
You're a legend, thanks!

Knew there was others, just had no luck.

---
They need to give us a Nukashine version and a Son's of Dane one.
---
I support them cause I like playing their game over all. They don't always do what I want them to fix but I know I am not the only player in the game so I am patient.
---
Whats your second star?
---
That wasn‚Äôt their statement. That was some ‚Äúleak‚Äù.
---
I PvP with my commando it's necessary to have a full health character.
---
You didnt copy over the + sign so power isnt alphabetized.
---
You can only do 110 max in PvP. I can hit that on someone who has 600 Damage Resist pretty easily. On the other hand, assassins, sentinel, auto stim, action refresh etc. perks on armor outweigh a little extra useless DR by miles and miles.
---
Thanks for the sell check mate
---
Something like "+20% damage +10% damage against other players"
---
I still kill a super mutant in 2 head shots with my handmade. It's not necessary for me to run with low health so I can bring that down to 1 shot. My commando is a pvp character too so low health isn't an option for him.
---
The answer is yes, but the ammo is so resource heavy it's more of a novelty weapon to use for fun occasionally.
---
who is legacy killa, never heard of him.
---
LK has been super salty with 76 coverage ever since they weren't invited to the Green brier event.
---
I wouldn't pay him much mind. Best to just ignore people like him rather than engage.
---
Kinda like exactly what you're doing.
---
Imagine The Fortnite Guy but complains a lot and hates Bethesda,Blizzard and EA with a passion.

You mean to see who ended up in a wall or flying off a mountain first

Couple months huh? Well, at least i know to avoid the stuff like the plague until it gets fixed, if it does that is...and yeah, i kinda figured it wasnt since the teleporting worked fine when it was released
---
The map doesn‚Äôt have an ‚Äúaid‚Äù section
---
Are
---
Oh no that's my bad hehe
---
Yea I was showing a new friend the game a couple months ago. We both took the nuka shine and I didn‚Äôt tell him what was going to happen... then I had to explain ‚Äúwe‚Äôll this isn‚Äôt exactly how it‚Äôs supposed to work‚Äù
---
Magosnow Kitten already corrected me (This is gonna become a meme ain't it.)
---
Anything that can fire more than one time without reloading will benefit. This includes full auto weps, bolt actions, quad/double versions of weapons that normally only hold one shot (harpoon, broadsider, fatman). Doesnt benefit those one shot guns if they dont have quad though
---
True but it gets so annoying at times.
---
I switch mine off every time but unfortunately it doesn't carry over to other players. It's a shame such a cool decoration plays such abysmal music. lol
---
Yes I like that
---
It's as bad as people make it out to be, but if you are patient and forgiving for bugs, glitches, crashes, freezes and corporate greed, you can make the game somewhat enjoyable.
---
LOL err bud you mispelled spellcheck.
---
It sounds like you were over encrumbered.

Thank you for clearing that up.
---
I've never been very good at building fancy, aesthetically pleasing CAMPS, but for some reason I'm a total whore for the wallpapers. It's almost embarrassing how excited I get when I see that there's a new one available. I agree that the ceilings really detract from the scene, and I've been dying to see better ones come out.
---
I really want to see wallpaper able to be applied to both sides, too. Or a separate category that is 'siding' that goes on the outside. The metal walls are the strongest in the game but they look like shit from the outside. Kinda sucks that we have to choose between either defense or aesthetic. The barn and brick walls are the only really decent looking walls when viewed from the outside.
---
Or like move your base.
---
People like him thrive on attention. Don't even view his vids or downvote. That still helps him.
---
Just don't engage &amp; remove him from your recommendations.

Hmm Odd I have been playing 76 since beta. I do not feel broken, I do not feel ripped off, sometimes annoyed at some of the bugs and glitches but I expected that going in. considering I spent the entirity of my last play session building my camp into an awesome looking airship I would say 76 offers a unique game for a reasonable amount of money. but hey that legacy guy probably has at least ten hours in the game being a pro you tuber and all that.
---
&gt;they weren't invited to the Green brier event
---
based on the title choices i wouldn't of invited them either
---
I'm gonna try it now thanks for the idea

True true

"Patrick write that down right THAT Down"

Be prepared for a hell of a fight at Grafton Steel. I think might be just as many if not more supermutants there than there are in a full Harper's Ferry spawn! And they spawn in tricky locations where they can end up flanking you from all sides.
---
The Penitentiary also has a large number of spawns. Good thing about the Pen and Grafton Steel is that the supermutants stop scaling with you around level 28(?). I think. I just know I've never seen any level 68s there. So they are decent places to go if you're struggling a bit in the mid-levels, having trouble finding anything that hasn't spawned at 68, and don't mind killing things a little bit lower than you.

"When is Wastelanders coming out??"
---
Insert spongebob meme
---
Damn son
---
Yes, quite a few actually, the most popular ones are Charlston Station and Janet's Soft Serve, the ladder one is the one you will have the most success, since its the easiest to find and people NEVER build there. (just down the road right behind the Whitesprings bus)
---
Go to Harper's Ferry, kill all of the Super Mutants/Scorched (there's usually \~15-20+), take their weapons, and sell them until the vendor's daily cap limit is depleted by server hopping. Most of them drop Assault Rifles, Combat Rifles, and Combat Shotguns which can all be sold for a pretty decent value with the right perks/chems. 
---
Another way is to just keep claiming workshops and defending them.
---
LOL all good man its the internet not a doctoral thesis.
---
Don‚Äôt even know who legacy is- I assume some YouTuber?
---
1: current game file size on my PS4 is  80.6 GB
---
2: yes people still play, I meet new people almost every time I play. However it doesn‚Äôt feel as jam packed as it did. I think the postponement of wastelanders and the lack of new content have a lot of long term players bored. Once you finish the quest line, level up, knock out most of your challenges, everything does get a little wash rinse repeat. Farm for legendaries, kill scorchbeast Queen, do the events? That‚Äôs the endgame for most. I am a late player (just started playing maybe 3 month‚Äôs ago?) so I haven‚Äôt been around since day one. I am not burned on the game yet. I still find plenty of people to interact with and things to do. 
---
3:  There is a lot of places to explore, 6 different unique regions with different environment types. Lots of buildings to enter and clear. The story is generally lacking meat (for me). Most of the backstory is learned through notes, terminals, holotapes. The lack of NPC characters is definitely felt and without other players it would really feel extremely empty. MAKE FRIENDS, they make the game feel more alive for sure. The player base is generally great and extremely nice/helpful. I think I‚Äôve had maybe 3-4 bad interactions from toxic players. A mic is greatly appreciated, makes communicating easier. Also if you stick to the quest line and just that, you will either burn through it quick or it will outlevel you. Don‚Äôt be afraid to break from that and work on your character or explore first once the quests start getting tough. Levels 25-50 were extremely grinding for me but once you get past a certain point things get easier.
---
I'd definitely enjoy a little more polish on the bounty system.
---
I do wonder if they'll add to it with Wastelanders. Like "if" there are choices to be good or evil in your actions towards the NPCs that could potentially earn you a bounty that other players could collect on.
---
Not exactly useful for the standard adventure mode but would add a little more to the Wastelanders DLC for the sake of RP and actual consequence to your actions.
---
Yes he is and he is a compainier/Internet whore and hates Blizzard,EA and Bethesda with a passion
---
If you head up to the crosshairs in the toxic valley way up on the mountains near the edge of the map there's what looks like snowflakes falling sometimes but it doesn't accumulate as snow on the ground, I have my camp up there and see if often it really makes it feel like winter in the wasteland

While I personally gave up on this particular raid, I can appreciate the points you made.  Because the vault is raid only and you‚Äôre pressed for time, inundated with enemies, or both, I‚Äôve never really taken the time I normally would to absorb the story.  
---
I picked up the holotapes and read the terminals during my first novice run, but I inferred that raiders gained entrance and turned the opportunity into a home invasion of sorts.   I‚Äôll have to examine it again if I can score a half decent explosive shotgun in the next two weeks.  Barring a full, well equipped team, I think kneecapping all the ghouls down is the only way to succeed at the end fight.
---
I would like to see gold increased to 10 caps per and silver to 5 caps per backed by robot vendors. Also the trade on these 2 metals shouldn't be effected by charisma or mentats. 
---
The devs would need to eliminate a bunch of the ore locations though by maybe only having them available at workshops.
---
1. unkown I am pc player
---
2. unsure - PC population seems pretty active. 
---
3. 76 plays a lot like fallout 4 after I have beaten the main story line. if you just like to wander around in the wasteland you will probably like it. people complain about nothing to do but I never have that problem and I have been playing since beta. just yesterday I made my camp into an airship. roughly half the size of the prydwynn. took 12 hours. its glorious to behold though.
---
and I disagree with sockular it hasnt been nearly as bad as its made out to be for me. part of that could be my pc tough so I dont know.
---
If someone is wanted then they should be ejected from their team.  If people team up with a wanted player then they, after a warning, should become wanted too.
---
Thanks for typing that out dude , appreciate it
---
yeah, i just buy one for like 7000 caps and end up disappointed because of his really low damage
---
Same dude.
---
I think it should work to the disadvantage of the attacking player, long before that point.
---
 Ie. If A &amp; B are on a team, and attack C in an attempt to get PVP or smash a camp up, then C should have a choice, if they fight back, then PVP is on, fair as it can be. However if C chooses not to retaliate, but A &amp; B keep harassing him, then after a cool down period (to negate friendly fire in events / accidents ) , C gets a choice to "ignore" or "post a bounty". If they post a bounty, it's a (example) 100 cap per team member minimum taken from the attacking player, posted to all teammates and an optional bounty payed by the "victim". This then renders all teammates wanted. (in this example A &amp; B would be wanted for 200 caps each)... If A&amp;B keep harassing none PVP players, the bounty keeps rising.... 
---
Hey presto, A&amp;B get their PVP and C gets to go about his day...
---
I second the Harper's Ferry suggestion. Also, get the plans for marine tactical helmets. Craft with super duper. Glass, rubber, and molded plastic is all you need. With Hard bargain maxed, it's 27 caps per helmet. Doesn't sound like much but dead easy to make 30 of them in just a few seconds.
---
So u post a link on here to get views?  If u didn‚Äôt like his opinion why not ignore him?
---
I see what you did there.
---
i actually did, surprisingly. I kinda have a problem when it comes to spending money, and I was strongly considering buying FO1. But, i did my research before I did so, and chose not to.
---
Don't build at the whitespring . Laggy whitesprings CAMPs are the worst, not surprised people try to destroy yours.
---
Why not?   Like with anything you do, you might or might not like it.  Try it. Don‚Äôt listen to the whiners about the game.  Get some experience before wastelanders.  Have fun.
---
I remember those good old days...it was even sweeter on hardcore when i used to have ears from top player at that time!Oh the memories!
---
Ha, yes it is PS4 üòÅ
---
I just added in a bunch if stability mods. And graphics ones
---
i think you mean nuclear winter :P
---
Thanks all. As I am not a Fallout 1st subscriber, I was just wondering.
---
I'm only lvl 55 and my current gear is to say the least,BAD!!I'm waiting to get some proper weapons at bear minimum,before i even attempt to get into the vault
---
He probably socializes in the real world &amp; doesn't need to in video games. If you want to socialize, try the real world and stop playing video games. Loser.
---
Stealth rifleman does ok vs the queen if you have other players to take her on. I usually pick off all the scorched and use vats criticals that I build up on the SBQ herself. This is only if you get good nuke placement to be able to fight outside the nuke zone.
---
I have also experienced something special after downing the cool blue giggle liquid.  Shortly after they became available, I had a little Nukashine session that went beyond the norm.  I counted 6 separate jumps that loaded (or almost loaded) into the varied spawn points before jumping again.  After the 6th jump, my screen just froze.  I watched my wife kill Scorched &amp; SuperMutants for about 30 minutes waiting for the screen to unfreeze or something before I finally rebooted the game.  All in all, I gotta say it was good fun.  
---
Since then, the wife &amp; I have 'shine races. First, pick a number of Nukashines to use, pick a starting location, choose the end location. The rule is drink one then start running to the designated end location, when you nukaphase to the next spot,  do it again until you have drank all the aged upon Nukashine. The winner is the person closest to the end location after all jumps are completed.  
---
Don't shy away from the Nukashine.  It's funtastic.
---
Really? Used to always find him up there ü§î

&gt; Event Start: 12:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday, November 26

&gt; Event End: 12:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday, December 3 
---
After the NW Halloween fiasco they decided to be clearer about the times events start and end by specifying the timezone.
---
And then they go and use the braindead anglo 12 hour clock.
---
12:00 pm.  Fuck, man, is that midday or midnight?
---
(Yes, I know which it is, but believe me, it's something you have to learn by rote, there is no logic).
---
12:00:00 AM .. 12:59:59 AM ... 01:00:00 AM ... 11:59:59 AM ... 12:00:00 PM ... 12:59:59 PM ... 01:00:00 PM ... 11:59:59 PM ... 12:00:00 AM .... and so the cycle continues.
---
Meanwhile, in a sane world.
---
0:00:00 ... 23:59:59 ... 0:00:00 ...

(Casting a veil over the mysteries of 23:59:60 and 23:59:61).
---
Was posted the last weeks several times here. It‚Äôs about all Legendaries but seems random.
---
Honestly the wanted system of getting wanted for accidentally shooting crops was funny. Like the whole map was after you for dropping someones mutfruit. Now I will get wanted for over 100 caps picking locks and I can walk around naked at white springs station and people will thumbs down me and log off.
---
That would actually be awesome.
---
Awesome! Thanks everyone for the responses
---
Are you ok?
---
Don't say that, you'll trigger the flat earthers who believe in the magical seeds.
---
If you go out 1 extra floor you can easily flip the wall around &amp; then remove the outer floor
---
I workshop PvP. The fact I can walk in and at my own will drop you is unfair. The second you walk into someone else's workshop you're flagged as hostile toward them, and them towards you. Instant PvP zone.
---
Im on ps4
---
Hey, I have that and still using it.it was so easy to acquire it back then. Thanks to YTer RifleGaming
---
Here's the thing man. They understand it. They just think that they don't deserve it. This player base has to be the most entitled player base ever. PvP has been all but banned from this game, the one and only place it remains is workshops and mark my words Bethesda will remove it at some point because people thing dropping 40 steel is a hangable offense.
---
And as we all know, there are absolutely no recordings that are available in the public domain.
---
Good idea but this game can't even handle the Halloween event without shitting itself
---
Almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter
---
I wouldn't say 5.56 is a currency, I think players are literally buying it to shoot stuff.
---
Some alternative options for "currencies" however might be flux - as it is universally useful, consumable and moderately high value. Con is that it weighs a lot.
---
Bobby pins may be the most appropriate alternative, as they sell to vendors for 1 and weigh 0.
---
Lol youtubers like this guy are such fucking neeks
---
You.... you play fallout games thinking the USA is the good guys???
---
F
---
How can someone downvote this? Why the hell does this community think a level 30 should be able to go toe to toe with a level 150 PvP build in an open work MMORPG? This is just a dumb notion and would make the game not worth playing whatsoever. Not to mention a PvE player vs a PvP player of the same level shouldn't be a real contest either.
---
Did you eat that salt they use to clear the roads?
---
Yea i bought the plans from whitesprings for the t51
---
&gt; I bought it since I didn't want to download the full game
---
77 gb patch with disc and 80 gb download if going digital. Lol dude you saved 3 gb üòÇ
---
Yes to snow but not going to happen, amount of work needed to cover the map in snow isn't an option unless we had mod support.
---
well if you have more than 999 of an ammotype it shows 999 
---
999 is sinply the highest number displayed in your hud
---
Ah shit now i feel dumb
---
haha no worries i dont think your dumb at all :D
---
I'd like to see any non atom shop content.  :P
---
Nope, feel happy b/c you've got enough ammo to go kill shit!
---
Thanks for the heads up , my team got this problem a few times already , thanks to you we're going to use a new server every few hours :)
---
I still kill them when I'm in the mood. 
---
So what if the team kills you? Junk and caps. Drop your junk first and caps are a joke if you can play for a few hours a day.
---
I'm so close to my sweet atoms reward.
---
Even if there's no Christmas event it'd be neat to see the Whitespring decorated.
---
Pretty new to raids, but I'd like to get into them too. I'll send an invite. My psn is viperxr22
---
They could really just reuse the white ashfall particles from the toxic valley
---
It's all we had till they restored access to Radios!
---
a snow machine that made it snow inside our c.a.m.p. circle would be cool.
---
Yeah, I didn't know that. I was expecting a reasonable patch size, not a patch to replace the whole game. üòÇ
---
Yeah I think?
---
LOL for me sometimes its like "one more queen fight then bed" pc crashes........"ok bed it is then"
---
I have mine behind a locked door.
---
I wanna see them fix the game.
---
Rad snow areas rofl. They could do a Krampus event. They could do alot of different things... But rad snow areas be sweet.
---
Only if it comes with an Olaf that can survive only in the mini-blizzard üòé
---
I price mine at 190-200 so other players can turn around a flip them. I'm sitting on about 1k serums at the moment üòÇ
---
It's hard to take a heavy guide serious when they don't use PA/stabilized. I'm not a huge fan of PA but the accuracy and AA benefit make it must on a heavy gunner build IMO. 
---
If I want to go fast I hope on my bloodied unarmed.
---
Yes! Also if you‚Äôre in the spot where your wall can go face out or in and flipping it around doesn‚Äôt get it in the right position, try pointing to where the wall will connect. At the top usually puts the wall face out, pointing at the floor usually puts the wall face in.
---
Stable servers?
---
The purveyor table doesn't include the dragon. That was datamined before the purveyor even came out, and I have yet to see a single dragon drop from her
---
I believe some months ago they adjusted certain legendary tables to fit the purveyor, so I guess yes, it doesn't drop anymore. The vault raids were dropping from the old tables for a while but I assume that was fixed by now, haven't played since they released due to the horrendous damage bug.
---
Stealth VATS Critical Commando build. with zero shotgun perks, an automatic combat shotgun is better in VATS than nearly every shotgun with an actual shotgun build ADS.
---
I only started buying recipes and crafting them.
---
Stupidly never thought to buy them when i was at max caps...
---
Voice of reason right here.
---
before I could make serums I collected and sold straight jackets to max vendors every day
---
795 for FO1st
---
If I pay for FO 1st and go to my own private server, every enemy should be leveled to me...
---
I've gone to WS and the ghouls were all Level 9...
---
Fuck that....
---
I was lucky, I received all the recipes in trading back when they were in the SBQs lot pool
---
It's weird because (this is my opinion) non-pvpers wanted pvp far away from then survival was created. And then it was non-pvpers who complained about not being able to farm extra xp and survival legendary challenges in survival without being 1 shot that legendary weapons and armor themselves were nerfed and that totally killed the mode. This community is so entitled I actually saw a post the other day "bring survival challenged back in adventure and give us special skins for the weapons too!" and it had tons of upvotes. Like survival died because no one would use it, why should we still get the prizes from it, and even extra shit. Farming legendaries on adventure was never hard. It was on survival. It was kind of necessary. I'm just but hurt that to get my PvP fix now I basically have to harass people.
---
Do they never drop anymore?
---
Exactly what I hoped it would be too.
---
raiders
---
I think that‚Äôs changed recently too, there‚Äôs been some slight changes to the layout there and you now have to fire a flare to start the event.
---
Mobile user here, just in case the formatting is really weird or something...
---
Blackberries. You will find plenty of blackberries in Savage Divide. The recommended perks are Green Thumb and Hard Bargain max lvl. With GT, you will get 2 blackberries for every plant that you harvest, and each one will cost 2 caps with HB maxed out. So if you harvest 50 blackberry plants, you will have 100 blackberries in your inventory, and when you sell them to a vendor bot, you will make 200 caps. It is pretty time consuming, and they're extremely cheap, but easy caps, the most obvious downside is that you will get overencumbered at some point.
---
If you play the game long enough and can shrug off the bugs you'll roll another character. It's a brutal grind to get crafting equal but it's really refreshing to be at the loading screen and decide what build you want to play.
---
I go bloodied unarmed, bloodied (somewhat bloodied I only really need it for the SBQ) heavy, and a commando dude. Plus I gather ammo and gear that one build doesn't use and should I mention that being able to feed 150x3 into the scrip slot machine is huge?
---
I have this issue on PC but it seems to be linked to my keyboard not the game. I have a corsair keyboard and sometimes I have to minimize the game and just open the corsair console and then the emotes work. I have no idea why this happens but this seems to fix it for awhile.
---
I‚Äôm using a 2* dcg and I‚Äôm over level 300 and not found anything that‚Äôs better. It all depends what the perks are, mines an instigating so the first blow nearly always kills them. Tried lots of other melee and all 3* but the one I‚Äôm using beats them all. I‚Äôve been trying to upgrade it to 3* for ages but can never find one.
---
No they were removed 5 or 6 months back, I know a lot of players have asked for them to be added back in to make the queen a more desirable target again.
---
Don't you mean holy water? Praise atom!
---
Nuclear Winter, of course!
---
they are stuck in endless amounts of character creation. can't get the noses looking right.
---
was it so hard to write "would you (all) like"
---
I hope not, the haters will just shit on anything they do or say.
---
Must for what? Again - I can easily solo anything in game except Encryptid and V94. And these are mechanics dependent, not damage. With how easy current content is - there is no "must".
---
Back in my day it was 75.
---
As a general comment what about selection for crowded events? It doesn‚Äôt take more than 5 or so folks‚Äô dots crowded together at an event to make it very hard to pick the public event itself to even initiate travel.
---
Happens with anything popular but Campfire tales and Uranium fever tend to attract a lot of folks and of course the Halloween event.
---
Zooming in sometimes can help but not always.
---
Cheers,
---
Dave
---
Ooh i like that idea...
---
They nerfed the drum mag stupidly a few patches ago.  It's worthless at this point.
---
every other death (no overencumbered, no pa, no unyielding, no radperk) whereever.
---
 it happens 100% when in nuked zone.
---
(yes 100%! since last patch) 
---
ps4
---
especially great in queenfights, but the game crashes mostly anyways so its actually a minor nuissance in that instance.
---
There are some YouTubers that have analysed what info is known, the trailers, data mining, etc. and have compiled some pretty solid conclusions.
---
Don‚Äôt complain too much, they will just nerf the stinging mag as well.....
---
No, each addiction you have adds 10% damage, up to 50%. Once you got the addictions - no further maintenance at all. You can of course keep using to gain the bonuses from chems in combat as well, but unless you use addictol to remove addictions - nothing to worry about.
---
We are also getting floaters. 
---
I would like to see a more advanced liberator, more robotty, it could deploy liberators.
---
The creatures confirmed right now are the wendigo colossus and floaters. I'd love to see some more passive animals just to throw in some more life. Birds and racoons would be cute! Maybe some angry fish to chill in the rivers and lakes too.
---
üòæ
---
You know i‚Äôm right....
---
Hardcore RP is always text dependent.  You are doing improv community theater with digital guns.  Sometimes people want to play as something that they-as a player- are not.  The simplest example is someone playing a character of a different gender: female characters with male voices are immersion breaking.
---
Foot pics?
---
I just world hop if people are gonna be that level of immature. Not worth wasting another minute of exasperation on. 
---
Not that I don‚Äôt get that people can be frustrating, I just don‚Äôt have time for twats.
---
I think being a random vault dweller without any real impact on the story is actually something I like. Whenever Bethesda try to write you as some important person in the world it always falls flat. I think a lot of the event story lines suck. Really low effort and feels out of place. I want to see some persistence amongst events across the world. Maybe have storylines that expand amongst multiple events. Like episodes maybe. I also think these events should actually focus on rebuilding the world. I also would like to see events for certain regions that change the state of those regions. Even if slightly. But would actually feel like players are interacting with the world. Maybe a push and pull between factions. 
---
Overall I think this game should focus on personal experiences rather than big epic storylines. I would maybe like a slight story moving forward maybe yearly or something in the background. This could make the world feel more alive than it does now. 
---
Another piece of story advice - remove the scorched. I like the scorched beasts but the actual scorched are really lame. The way they move, their AI, the fact that they all look the same. I really hate them.
---
I mean I never make it but each west tech run grants me at least 100 so if you do this a few times you can sell it in your vendor for a quick buck.
---
There are some large skeletons of I‚Äôm assuming fish or huge snakes.. 1 is under water in the pit in the mire, the other is in a cave in the mire. There is another large fish on a boat coming from the north (I think) towards the mothman shrine. The one on the boat is an actual fish body with big teeth. It would be cool to see creatures like this in some bodies of water around the map
---
No it's only happened twice randomly.
---
These mutant snakes could have multiple heads, either fused together or independent. We could call them Hydras.
---
And in general more mutant avians wouldn‚Äôt go amiss. I mean yeah we got the scorchbeasts if we don‚Äôt count the low flying insect enemies, but that‚Äôs it. The concept art for ‚Äúrad storks‚Äù from Fallout 4 looked amazing.
---
I also wouldn‚Äôt mind centaurs returning, though it might be a bit difficult due to lore reasons. Maybe some raiders set up base on a pre-war facility with vats of FEV? To which they threw in innocent victims for giggles only to have these monstrosities crawl out months later?
---
I thought it was all interesting myself as it all connects to each other well.
---
I hope they do keep the level of detail in wastelanders though I don't think they will as most player don't care for, don't like or didn't notice the story. So I feel they properly make a FO4 like story.
---
Women's luck I tell ya haha
---
There better be eggnog!
---
Are u on psn
---
Rock on
---
Yes. Psn EszterKiss if you'd like to check it out
---
Thank you :)
---
Same with the Fermenter, I don‚Äôt agree with it but this mechanism has worked like this for a while
---
Nice!
---
Which pieces are those?
---
Great idea, have been thinking about this recently. Feel like I can only stick around Mire/cranberry bog for my time to feel ‚Äúworthwhile‚Äù.
---
I would like too im new to the Game and i Love the camp Feature i add u
---
Isn‚Äôt this the guy who accidentally tweeted out animal porn then deleted it. 
---
No thanks
---
Inv me i just finish my round nuclear Winter
---
Quick question does fresh server mean like a new server or leave and reenter world
---
Ex: I launched a nuke on white springs would I have to leave the server and abandon the nuke for legendary s to spawn or would leaving and reentering refresh the server
---
You just have to join my server and fast travel to it. It's next to Clarksburg and the shops are on so you can just fast travel to it
---
\-
---
Went on my bros private server 1 time to farm ghouls/junk/whatever and level 22 feral ghoul reavers. Were both over level 100. Wtf.
---
Ooooooo, very nice! I'm weirdly excited about my new combo too, ritual bindings, sentry bot helmet and keep out backpack. I look like an enemy in the later part of a Tomb Raider game, when shit always gets weird
---
Green hood and Traveling Leather coat, wrap around goggles.  I believe that the face covering is from the atom shop, I use a green bandana.
---
WHAT!!!??
---
It's a bug. If you delete something from your camp you should be able to put stuff in the refrigerator, and you should be able to put the camp item back that you removed afterwards.
---
wow, a raid post with positive karma and positive things, this is a first
---
I just leave the ammo factory running on my private server all day while I do events etc, free caps.
---
If you launch a nuke on whitespring you have to leave and reenter to get them to respawn the first time.
---
This ^
---
Exterminators AP Sentinel Marine Armor Max lvl
---
Literally everything depends on Wastelanders. It recently came to light that Bethesda is patching that version of the game INSTEAD of the current version, so a lot of the bugs we're waiting on are actually fixed for Wastelanders but not the live version. 
---
I am really, REALLY worried that Wastelanders is going to be paywalled. If it is, it pretty much spells doom for this game. But if Bethesda wakes up and makes it free, it's by far this game's best shot at being fixed.
---
It will go great with my Northern Lights PA and my santa beard hat and dark glasses!
---
How do people make circular walls/fences?
---
Just do 270 degree left turns üòùü§£
---
In all serious had not noticed this but had noticed lag last night... will pay attention to turning right tonight...
---
Crap i just scripped a TS dragon looted long time ago, didn‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs collectible status now ü§Æ
---
I'm sure that the *one guy* they have working on the game is doing his best.
---
lol too true
---
I tried to visit but i got glitched under the map
---
There is a method with foundations, look it up on youtube. Tho this one is not an example of that, I've created it with rugs and non clipping fences
---
Yes please
---
Why stop there, increase stash size to 4000 and let us share it among our five toons, no more headaches no more grinding üëçüèª
---
It's really annoying in the silos, the turrets cripple almost immediately. I basically run the silo in crutches.
---
Well that's a first. You sure it just didn't load in yet? You should arrive at the very top
---
That looks awesome!
---
see: fallout 1st
---
pretty sure its still region specific due to friends of lower levels that may play with you.
---
BUT, you should b able to toggle this on/off.
---
I tried to do the raid the other day and the vault wouldn't open for me. My brother was able to enter and I was suck outside.
---
it switches every tuesday est and rewards reset at 8pm est (meaning you get rewards again)
---
yup.  The vampire switchblade is capable of doing the same.  Now if I could just get my non-PA armor DR spec high enough, I'd have it made. :)
---
Amazing!
---
NP.  Glad some of it was useful to you.
---
I'm part of a group of dataminers, and that's straight from the game files. Check my user history here.
---
üòÇüòÇ I've been only turning left for the past hour
---
That didn‚Äôt seem to work this time as soon as I re built , it would resume firing.
---
The only thing i could do was pack up my camp and move elsewhere.
---
I'm using:
---
\- [Traveling leather coat](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Traveling_leather_coat_(Fallout_76)) (This one is extremely rare. It has a really low chance to drop from some events in the Mire. I was very lucky and got it as a reward from It's a Trap event. There's also another variant for this outfit, the [leather coat](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Leather_coat_(Fallout_76)). It's a very rare drop aswell, and the only difference is that the traveling leather coat comes with a backpack)
---
\- [Green hood](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Green_hood_(Fallout_76))
---
\- [Welding googles](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Welding_goggles_(Fallout_76))
---
\- Stalker bandana (this one is from the Atomic Shop. It came with the [stalker outfit](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Stalker_outfit), which I think it's not longer available in the Atomic Shop)
---
You unlock the drum before the stinging.
---
Fix the game first, don‚Äôt give them any more ideas to push away from fixing main game. Their doing good so far
---
/u/Unbeatable04
---
I think a non-explosive shotgun would probably be better.  The explosive ones are pretty reliable about causing that obnoxious damage rubber-banding effect.
---
Santa skin? A vault dweller can dream.
---
Tried it with my +1 the other day on standard. We ran dead in the water multiple times last week and loved it each time. The keycard RNG location spawns with Meltdown ultimately destroyed us though. I keep reading others thinking the puzzles are the most frustrating thing for a lot of people. I'm not convinced that's the reason for the hate/disinterest. I love the puzzles, maybe I'm an outlier? 
---
The bigger reason I don't run it as a level 170+ with a good heavy weapons build and decent weapons though, is the fact that we're TIMED to do them. Add to this the lag and instability, and they quickly become a pain. The timer ruins the raids for us, and we find little point in doing it on novice as the amount of bullets I spend far outweighs any awards I get. 
---
And this is also understanding that I am only doing it with 1, sometimes 2 other people. I would love to find 2 other regulars to do them with, but without an in-game chat system or a LFG option, it's too difficult. Plus, I think most fallout fans liked fallout games to play on their own. The community itself is already fairly independent-minded. It's sad, because I genuinely do think the raids are interesting - delving was always the more fun things to do in previous bethesda games, but adding a timer 'bECaUsE iT's DiFicCuLT' was just a lazy design choice in my humblest of opinions.
---
Any new high lvl creature will be welcome for me, but the content matters more to me.
---
Wastelanders, like Skyrim will supposedly have dialog choices with consequences.
---
**I want new benefits for high lvl players so leveling matters again**.  it will keep the game alive longer (at least for me).
---
Meh.  Makes for a nice and easy play session, which once in a while, isn't necessarily a bad thing.
---
And Christmas radio!!!
---
I'm a dataminer, and I can confirm that they no longer drop from the purveyor or enemies, but they still drop from the raid as of this patch.
---
To me, it looks like a dolphin with shark teeth.  IIRC, it made an appearance in previous versions of FO.
---
You get 31 caps per helmet if you have a full set of Unyielding armor at low health.
---
Old school diving helmet.  Full metal sphere with "porholes"
---
Maybe bcause i fast Travel too you and Not the Camp ?
---
Yeah it does look like that
---
How did you get up there

how‚Äôs about we have them fix the game first before any other ideas. Cause I‚Äôd like to play without having to crash in the middle of taking a workshop
---
Something like this would be awesome, and I don't even like PvP. But if you could rack up a bounty without being a dick, essentially posting a "come and get me" tag on your head, combined with the building system in this game? Think of the possibilities! Build yourself a fortress and let would be bounty hunters try their hand at taking your down from your snipers nest.
---
Oh actually just tried it and yeah, if you fast travel on me not the camp, you can clip in between the rugs and the stash boxes I used as support. It does look like under the map, but it doesn't :D I was able to just jump up quickly and not be stuck there
---
We've found it happens if you seek revenge too quickly whilst being disintegrated or juiced by an energy weapon. It seems to be most commonly caused by legacies and Teslas. I was spectating a fight recently where one of the participants had to relog several times as he seemed to quite reliably damage bug himself, I do not know if it was intentional.
---
I'd like to see this setup reconsidered, yes.
---
What I'd suggest is giving each region its own type of West-Tek dungeon.  There's precedent for this now.  The Capitol Building is in the Forest, but has a warning about the level of the enemies instead.  Encryptid takes place right in the middle of the Ash Heap.
---
Nice idea. A fireplace wouldn't be too bad either.
---
Really? How about a company that‚Äôs willing to fix the game. That way they have more people spend money.
---
Instead of aiming out it could aim up and fall in like a circular shape making like a snow globe type thing
---
I had it happen a couple of times soon after nukashine was added.
---
You just need to manually fasttravel to break out of the loop before it fades out again.
---
If it doesn't have it already, add the extra claw.
---
I have an ultracite suit, but I rarely don it since switching to bloodied(except to cross the bridge to Uranium Fever...). I have the x-01 plans I just haven't built it yet.
---
Radaway is great in a pinch but the -50 disease resist for 2 hours is just asking for bone worms/rad worms. And rad worms is doubly dangerous for bloodied since you're already susceptible to radiation. Though I just discovered last night that building the fertilizer thing in my camp gives me a free brahmin, which in turn gives me free milk that removes rads. So that just got a bit easier. Now just to find the rad emitter plans so I can stop standing in lakes...
---
Claiming workshops isn‚Äôt toxic. You‚Äôre warned about PvP before capturing and you‚Äôre taking a risk. It‚Äôs an intended game design and there‚Äôs nothing toxic about it. Don‚Äôt even imply that adventure is PvE, because there‚Äôs a good portion of PvP, especially without survival
---
I really don't think they are stupid enough to make wastelanders a paywall. They may give 1st players extra stuff and it would be really cool if you could actually "fix" the world with new NPCs.  Of course the creatures/mutants will still destroy stuff just like your camp, but it would be a constant fun battle.
---
There could be major quests that involve settling NPCs and getting there help to clear Robco and reclaim/defend it kinda like workshops but harder...etc...
---
Only 34,000 atoms.
---
The Decontamination shower will still take away your mutations if it correct? To avoid losing your mutation get the starched genes level 2 perk in luck!
---
You will still lose it even if you use a second shower, you need the perk card equipped that lets you keep them...
---
You know, you might be onto something; I usually click-click revenge immediately after death, to keep the fight flowing. I will test this out next time I find J/BE Laser user...
---
Place camp at bottom, build up 5 stories, jetpack up to the top, place camp there. Before you get down have a friend and test the fast travel spot so it's def in a good place. You can do that buy moving the little camp thingy itself around
---
Correct
---
Sorry- misread the question
---
Get the perk starched genes 2.  When that is equipped, you will not lose mutations when you walk through/by an active decon shower, or take radaway.
---
BTW, full strength radaway will supress mutation(s).  
---
Use diluted - mutations will remain active.
---
What are you trying to say, this makes no sense
---
I have a ve laser rifle and it is my main gun for my vanguard high health build. I can usually kill most mobs with 1-2 shots. It's useless for SB and SBQ, and it does break fairly often. But while I'm using it I'm in god mode, just as long as I dont shoot my feet lol.
---
As others have mentioned, Floaters are slated to come back.  Depending on how they make their AI, this could be a very good addition.  Right now, few enemies have recourse for following your Marsupial jumps up a building.  Even Eyebots are essentially tied to the ground.  But something that can actually levitate over obstacles and say hi on the rooftops would be a welcome thing to have.
---
Thanks! The vendors or the camp thing decide the fast travel spot?
---
I had a similar issue on PS4, and my character was moving on their own. Turns out I had dust on the contact inside my controller. 
---
Take and lift the analog stick (gently, just enough to slightly raise it), then take the hose from a vaccum cleaner and put it over the stick, and use your hands to create suction. You'll be able to hear the little bits of dust come out.
---
 
---
Would anyone have any of the Decontamination showers or spare plans?
---
When survival was first released the whole point of it was "more risks, more rewards".  But players complained about the amount of caps and aid they would lose, saying they were being punished for being high level, so that got nerfed real quickly.  Then came the complaints about Top 3 being highlighted on the leaderboard and that got nerfed, too.  Again, this was the PvP crowd saying "Why should I be punished and have a target on my back because I'm good?"  It got to the point where the risks had become so minimized that they were fairly negligible, but the rewards stayed the same; it became "a little more risk for a lot more reward".  And I think that is what started luring a lot of PvE characters over into the survival world. Even before damage caps, Survival had become a fairly low-risk gamble.  But it's not entirely fair to lay the death of Survival mode squarely on the shoulders of the PvE community; the groundwork for everything that followed had been laid by survival players themselves.
---
The radgobbler.
---
The camp thingy. You just have to move it and someone has to fast travel there to test. If not good just move again. They'll not fast travel where the camp thingy is but pretty close
---
I do
---
One more question sorry, where you able to place foundations up there? 
---
Once again sorry to bug you- I just plan to build up there now haha
---
Patrolling the Mojave almost...
---
Ah fuck it.
---
No one will be able to help you without knowing which system you‚Äôre playing on, however, you need a perk even with Decon shower to ensure your mutation doesn‚Äôt get wiped.
---
yut same here
---
havent seen this yet but i mostly play alone on 1st.  I do my runs, and may stay for an hour or 2.
---
thanks for the info.
---
lvl 98 11986 caps
---
Well max cap is 30k per char, more or less maxed out on my 4 chars
---
wish they would up the max
---
It‚Äôs legit crazy how people keep asking for stuff that straight up isn‚Äôt going to happen.  They are not listening
---
My main is 182 (29 Unused), got to about 28k in Caps before I purchased 20k in PA plans as I was so close to caps limit and had items in my vendor that would "Cap out".
---
If your Xbox I have a spare plan for you free
---
It would be lore-friendly, too, with all the ski lodges around.
---
Have a quest where, say, someone at the Top of the World is getting nostalgic for a white Christmas. They find some plans for an industrial snow maker like the lodges have to use sometimes. They enlist you on a quest to visit all the resorts on the map and find parts for the machine at each one. Once you bring the parts back, you build the thing at a Tinker Bench and they mount it themselves or show you a way to get to the TotW to mount it yourself. Start it up to test it and the quest is done. You get the plans for you to build your own, some miscellaneous stuff, and an invitation for an exclusive, one day party (event) at TotW on Christmas Day. 
---
The event could start out cool like a Christmas Eve dance party, then everyone toasts with Nukashine at midnight. Things go wonky and everyone passes out, only to wake up, hungover (debuffed) and have to fight off a wave of leveled (on the high side...kind of like the last bit of the Halloween Mayhem event) monsters and those who take down the big boss get a guaranteed 3 star ranged weapon, a guaranteed 3 star melee weapon, AND a guaranteed 3 star armor piece.
---
Merry Christmas, Appalachia. :D
---
Just run **Powering up Poseidon** power station event like everyone else, more satisfying than leaching off others.
---
Level 321 and range from 150k to 0 caps day in day out as I never keep hold of them for long.
---
Also use 556 ammo as currency but only have 25k atm.
---
I've lost it
---
I'm ps4
---
Main is 475ish, I have 90k caps stored right now, but I've been spending a LOT recently. I have 2 other characters that generate their own income, so I'm not counting those three as having saved caps.
---
Similar in that my caps ebb and flow as I buy more plans in an effort to learn them all on one character
---
I agree I did not take bandolier into account. And not everyone has a scrapbox. Gold is purely useful as a deferred source of caps for players under a specific set of circumstances, so it probably will not catch on.
---
My main is 99 and I only have about 3k caps left from my player vender shopping spree last night
---
Rad-x you mean
---
I love the Mr Fuzzy ride visitor killer trap ü§£ a little obvious but, good game, love the camp, I tried this and gave up in frustration.
---
Your maximum selling price of any item is maxed at 20 Charisma*, regardless of how you get there. While Hard Bargain adds an invisible +3 Cha per rank, if you can reach Cha 20 through any means you‚Äôll max out selling prices. For example, a full set of Unyielding armor can get you up to +15 Charisma, and a beer adds +1, and a Sweet Roll adds +3.  With a base Charisma of 1, that puts you at 20. 
---
For purchasing, your lowest price hits at Charisma 25. Popping a Grape Mentats gets you that last bit needed. 
---
* *Depending on the base value of the item, you may get to the highest selling price or lowest buying price at a lower Charisma.*
---
Am I the only one that read it as " encrypted with a cross bow is super easy"
---
It would be awesome!
---
I dunno, . . . not sure I want to switch my build to a Bloodied Salesman.
---
Tried a Junkied Camp Contractor playthrough once, but I kept dropping a hammer on my foot because my hands were so jittery.
---
https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2018/articles/2018-11-18-17-11/fallout_76_level_zones_map.jpg
---
Awesome! Thank you for sharing!
---
Stay in the low level areas and lv up
---
A
---
You're probably in an area too high for you. Just chill in the forest, toxic valley, or ash heap where the enemies are lower level until you get some better gear.
---
You are probably sticking to the main quest line and you shouldn‚Äôt be (at your level). Stick mostly to the left side of the map at your level.  I‚Äôd recommend leveling at Grafton Dam, Grafton Steel, Eastern Regional Penitentiary at your level.
---
Return to the quests at level 50+.
---
I have a 2\* bloodied fire axe (with faster swing) and a 2\* bloodied pickaxe (also with faster swing). The pick axe with the sharp mod is sitting at 624 damage, and the fire axe is in the 580s without mods. Last night I did over half of West Tek with that pick axe. And I'm not even using melee perks.
---
What is ffr? Sorry newbie (well returnie technically)
---
Sorry for the late reply. To avoid the afk kicking from time to time just move your character. I‚Äôd pace em left or right every 10-15min or so.
---
I don‚Äôt have a main character, but I have a couple around level 200.  I have over 300K caps.
---
I'm unsure why they haven't done that yet, there was quite a lot of anger fro the drum balancing though, maybe next year.
---
Oh that sounds like  from nuclear winter
---
Stinging is the only one worth using imo.
---
Lots of PS4 players...you'll like it.  the quests are meh, but there is lots of content.  I've played for a year now, and other games end with no replay value, and thats why i like fo76.  Does it get boring for somebody who's played almost 2k hours? yeah, but i still find new stuff, an new ways to play.  Still looking for a BFFRFR lever, and always changing up my armor.  Most people like armor sets (matching), but i find the most value in mixing pieces with diff perks.
---
It's rad-x that will suppress, with or without perk cards. With maxed starched genes equipped no radaway will remove or suppress mutations.
---
You should get the shower plan for free the first time you kill the SBQ too.
---
how in the world do you have 300k caps ?
---
In general, you can scrounge more materials in an hour than a workshop will produce in an hour.
---
But workshops do give plants for capturing them.
---
So....
---
Clear the area, capture the workshop, and immediately head to green line.  As soon as capture is complete, step outside of the zone, and leave the area.   
---
You'll still get the plan and other rewards for capturing the workshop.
---
If you are still nearby when the defend (CG enemies) appears, check the enemy type.  If CG, you can probably stay outside the zone and snipe the CG enemies.  
---
If successful, you still get the reward.
---
If its another player, well... up to you if you want to fight for it.
---
After level 50........its a level playing field. 
---
The rest is down to weapons and armor.
---
Someone below level 50 with a quad Tesla would more than likely destroy my level 321 bloodied commando in a pvp situation.
---
Main is 324, alt is somewhere around 120.
---
Cap levels very a lot, but rarely get above 15K on each of them.  The main has pretty much everything she could ever buy, including all the serum plans, so a lot of her fortune was spent getting the alt up to speed.
---
&gt;angry fish
---
nice on toast apparently
---
Do you have PS4?
---
I‚Äôm a huge weapon trader.  I typically sell 20-50K in weapons per day.
---
I‚Äôd like to see the game actually be functional, tbh
---
Yep - been spending a lot of time doing the Rosie quest at top of the world - not ready for those combatants
---
This post made me sad. I imagined it playing out like this.
---
OP gets plan donated (because finding the plan is hard).
---
OP realizes how many stable flux it takes to build DecomShower. 
---
OP gets flux donated (because farming flux is hard).
---
OP builds DecomShower.
---
OP excited powers it up and stands under the healing mist. 
---
OP loses mutation because that‚Äôs what the DecomShower is for. üòî
---
Does stinging even help with armor penetration on an aae handmade?
---
Whatever.  You are wrong, but hey, we can have our own opinions.  I'm sorry if you chose to take offense at it.
---
It is toxic, because it isn't PvP, as this OP brings up.
---
I really just want Dogmeat again, he was so awesome, the work they put into that character model was amazing, why not use all that work üêï‚Äçü¶∫
---
Stopped playing but reached over a million caps. Bought every plan I came across including every serum. Made my own meta game with 9 accounts but got bored. Their levels total 550 but my main was 210 or so. I went wide instead of deep.  
---
Feel like I have unfinished business with this game (I still read this sub) but can't bring myself to reinstall yet.
---
No worries. And no, you have to do it with stash boxes and rugs only. File cabinet, daisy rugs and big rugs on top, for the roof the little red containers, daisy rugs and big rugs. It took me 3 hours to do the floor and roof, tho I had to scrap back a few times while I was experimenting
---
since the max is 30k, and you only have 2 chars, how can you have more than 60k max?
---
No life
---
Like I said in my post, I have 3 accounts (15 characters).
---
Funnily enough when you get off you don't just fall down, you'll stand in the open air, and you can jump back to the rugs :D But yeah, it's just an obvious joke if you want to leave dying
---
Across all my accounts currently 540k plus change. Been spending quite a bit lately.
---
I don't have a main as such; I have a full team (333, 274, 252 and 187) and a number of 'mules' ranging from 11 to 90.
---
I‚Äôm just stating facts bro. You claim a workshop, and you‚Äôre warned that PvP can get initiated by doing so. It‚Äôs game design, and not toxic. It‚Äôs realistic that a workshop would get contested, the world isn‚Äôt all rainbows and sunshine like you want it to be. PvP is a part of adventure and always will be, no matter how much you guys whine
---
Obviously you‚Äôre just upset you‚Äôve gotten stomped at a workshop a few times
---
Powering up Poseidon doesn't drop the decon shower plans.  You get those the first time you successfully complete Scorched Earth.
---
Sounds like fun, but this game is for people in all walks of life and not everyone celebrates Christmas. I think it would be cool, but probably never done because of this. But you can keep dreaming.
---
Yes it has been an issue for a lot of people lately. Not sure when this started in total, but it has happened to me too. Annoying at best.
---
The death of survival was 100% the legendary nerf, which no one who took PvP seriously was mad their weapon did too much damage. The only people who were mad were people who couldn't keep up.
---
yeah you didn't originally, but now you've edited your main posted, without writing :edit
---
Because you can only get 1400 caps daily from the robots (unless you also buy some items from them to replenish their caps pool at a 4:1 tradeoff), so anything you sell to players is a bonus. 
---
And buying from players to sell to the ‚Äòbots is actually diminishing returns. While it can be faster and save time, you lose out on caps overall. 
---
Example: if you start with 1000 caps, and buy two serums for 200 caps, then sell those to the ‚Äòbots for 500 each, you‚Äôve made a 600 caps profit. *(New total: 1600 caps)*
---
If you crafted them yourself you would have made a 1000 caps profit, for the investment of the time spent on gathering materials and crafting. *(New total: 2000 caps)*
---
Personally, I just do a quick Grafton run and make 30 Marine Tactical Helmets (usually end up with 39 due to Super Duper 3), run by Point Pleasant to pick up about 20 Mothman Eggs and make Omelets, and sell this MTHs for 1209 caps and 19 of the the MMEOs for 190 caps. Then unless I‚Äôm also buying something to partially restock the bot cap pool, I sell a Technical Data for that last 1 cap.
---
I get a decent amount of XP and some other loot as well, all in about 10 minutes. Usually get to kill the Grafton Monster too as a bonus. 
---
Pretty much everything else I sell at a major discount in my vendor, since at that point it‚Äôs just extra caps.
---
The good thing is that the more you play the more XP you will earn. This will increase your levels and you can add points to your SPECIAL attributes and assign new perk cards! Plus you‚Äôll have access to higher level weapons and armor! 
---
Basically what I‚Äôm saying is don‚Äôt worry about not being able to kill high level stuff today, because if you play the game for several days you eventually will be able to! üëç
---
Nope it was there from the start.  If I edited it, I would have added the edit tag.
---
Clearly you are not listening.. we will spend money on a snow machine.
---
That‚Äôs fine, apparently from other I found out the game won‚Äôt kick you if you are in a workbench at least from the last time I tested it
---
Facts. Survival was amazing until food builds started coming in for XP farming and complaining en mass that they got curb stomped all the time. Then of course survival became an even bigger train wreck with nerf after nerf.
---
Legendary creatures will Regen their health after you get them down to half health. He shouldn't be able to do it multiple times though just once.
---
I definitely use ammo as a currency (or as a way to exceed the cap limit). I have around 100K 5.56 and .45s at the moment. .45 is in higher demand than 5.56 right now due to the fixer.
---
This, so much this. At level 18 you should only be at the Forest and Toxic Waste to the North.
---
Ash Wastes to the south is within reach, but you'll have to be careful, EVERYWHERE else you're too low level.
---
what are you gathering in this Grafton run?
---
The acid at the gold course is popular too. Outside of that you are spot on.
---
Right.  when I first started getting mutations, I couldn't remember which suppressed and which didn't, so after one too many accidental suppresses, 
---
I only use the diluted version of both.  No more problems. :)
---
There are many ways to kill them one by one at any level.  Patience and strategy.  The rush of the kill is sweet.
---
I wouldnt have asked if it said 3 accounts, so stop lying..go sell some weapons and hoard caps
---
Well that is annoying! But I guess it makes sense. I need more 10mm ammo. I don't have the best of guns for a lvl 22. I have the legendary Desert Storm, a 10mm with burn. Love it but it could be better.
---
hammers get slippery when wet too
---
What did you do about rads building up?
---
That's true, didn't really think of that.
---
Someone mentioned waiting until level 50.  Quest rewards scale with your level so waiting makes sure you get the most powerful version of them. Granted most of them will be outclassed by legendary drops eventually, but some of them might be nice for you to have at Max level depending on your build.
---
99% sure I didn‚Äôt change it,  it is 6am here tho and I‚Äôm half asleep so i guess anything‚Äôs possible.  I‚Äôm not lying...I wouldn‚Äôt lie over something so minor.  Though I don‚Äôt appreciated being called a liar.  
---
I‚Äôm just posting here trying to help answer your questions.
---
Exactly. I saw it happen as I switched to survival the day it came out, and tapered off very quickly after the final weapon nerf that left my handmade doing 8 damage per shot in vats at point blank range to a douche in excavator armor.
---
GG you da man
---
Personally, i would not trade a high value item for caps/.556.  Its a way for people to get good stuff from others w/o having to trade high end gear. I've seen trades where somebody offers 100k .556 to get a great weapon.
---
CAPS and AMMO to me are the same, so when im low, I'll buy 5k rounds for 5k caps.
---
Also, even though the handmade and all its variants are great weapons, i dont use them much due to VATS loss, unless im fighting a big enemy w/o VATS.
---
This
---
How about a variation of the greenhouse some with it as a snow globe!
---
I‚Äôm throwing money at you, BGS.  All you have to do is put it in the store...
---
It‚Äôs better of weapons that already have high fire rate.
---
Cool camp
---
Make sure to sell the legendary weapons you don't want at the train station slot machines. You can save up some scrip for when you eventually stumble across Mama Murgles who will give you some better stuff.
---
The game is based in post apocalyptic America. It is heavy on anti commie and pro 1950 Americana. Currently there is a lot of Thanksgiving stuff, which is an American only holiday. Most people don't celebrate it, but it is there because it fits the theme of the game, just as Christmas would.
---
I would like us to be able to play pool,drive cars,change the building to delete whatever piece you want instead of how they want things deleted. Have friends build right next to each other. On private server be able to place tent anywhere and add a Tinkers Bench. Would like to place ore as well in the stash box. I agree with the jukebox idea.
---
27 basketballs and kickballs and 5 extinguishers. 
---
91 rubber just from those.
---
I find it‚Äôs less good on low fire rate weapons.  You won‚Äôt really notice the difference on a lever action that goes from 5 to 6 fire rate.
---
I honestly don't care about creatures I want to murder actual humans and not fried ghouls. Also if they could ditch the petrified corpses that would be great, they're just a drain on the server. But I'm sure they're thinking of how they can make us pay to remove them.
---
Yes I agree that was the deathblow.  I'm just saying that survival players shot themselves in the foot by making that mode more appealing to the average PvE player.    Toward the end, you'd lose more caps in a pvp encounter on Adventure than you would for that same encounter in survival.  No one being highlighted on the leaderboard meant you could spend hours on Survival without encountering another soul.  *That* was when the PvE crowd began saying "maybe I should get in on that sweet extra XP".  If they stashed most of their aid before logging on, what did they really have to lose at that point?
---
Happens sometimes with non legendaries as well. Had a scorchbeast the other day that I couldn't get lower than 25% before it would regen. It's a glitch, and sometimes due to lag. Just have to relog and write it off.
---
I‚Äôm surprised ‚ÄúDrink a Nukashine‚Äù hasn‚Äôt been offered as a daily challenge.
---
follow the overseers questline.  It will keep you in more or less level appropriate areas.  Go back to the left side of the map.
---
The map has several areas, each targeted for a range of levels
---
In general, the forest (left side of the map) is for L1-20.
---
The toxic valley (north, by the alligator), L20-30
---
The ash heap (South) L30-40
---
The Savage Divide (center strip) L40-50
---
The Bog and The Mire (right side) L50+
---
There are some crossover areas where enemies scale up/down to suit the players in the area, but by and large, enemies are low, medium, or high level bases on the above regions.
---
  @L18, you should be working on the mysteries and firebreathers questlines.  Also, recruitment blues, as well as the tadpole pioneer scout badges.
---
Appreciate the offer but I'm on PC. No worries, I'm sure I'll find one.
---
I second that reckon.
---
I think he‚Äôs referring to how many caps his ONE main character has stored up.
---
This! i never get griefers at my CAMP on the east side.  WS is like the bad part of the town for CAMPS.
---
That event involved a lot of AI/combat responses, so it's a much different scenario. Adding in snow would simply be giving a new weather type to cycle to, and white/glistening texture changes for basic terrain. None of that should be particularly impactful. The snow itself doesn't have to actually accumulate or anything.
---
The only caveat is they'd probably have to keep the snow limited to ground only-- so none on car or building roofs-- but overall it wouldn't be that hard to give some winter groove.
---
This!!!
---
Coffee, cannabis and Fallout 76 is a golden combo!!!
---
I still play through D1 and D2 occasionally. Still too chicken to play hardcore. ü§£
---
Maintenance is every 2 weeks. Follow Beth Support twitter. Theyll always mention it there.
---
Lvl 21, sitting on 10k caps, but tend to generate them pretty quickly (maybe 3-4000 a day). My hope is to rebuild America with my investments.
---
oh damn I forgot Twitter.  thanks
---
What he said is pretty spot on.  Legacy Gatling Plasmas want to kill you, but damn are they fun.  I do find the VE GP is less likely to kill you than the BE variant though.  It just gives you a bit more of a buffer.
---
I really hope you're joking... that's the cost of entire DLC. &gt;\_&gt;
---
Pretty neat :)
---
I sell meat. Glowing meat steaks sell for a ridiculous amount considering how common it is, and all cooked meat is worth at least a couple caps. Slap on Butchers Bounty lvl 3 and take a stroll through toxic valley and the mire gunning down any animal you see, find a stove and put on Super Duper, cook it all up and you should have enough product for your daily vendor cap limit, as well as tons of leather, acid and other mats
---
Quick fix: building mode, store turret, put it right back
---
I noticed my BE Laser Rifle was HORRIBLE vs Scorchbeasts.  They must have high energy resists.  My BE Fixer kills them way more quickly.
---
The caps limit was put into place very early on. Be honest. I don't care how much you like PvP losing 500 caps 3 or 4 times in a row sometimes within 30 seconds isn't appealing to literally anybody, and not sustainable. You're making it seem like a huge cap sink kept them out for a long time but that cap limit was put into place like either the first or 2nd patch after survival came out.
---
Yeah, that's the big takeaway.  "Bug."
---
I go to a public server after all first people have left the server and then go to a private again. That gives you a new private server
---
TSE is pretty bad.  Well, the TS part is bad.
---
And?
---
So glad you referred to GTA :))
---
I just can‚Äôt understand why they would fuck it that bad. At first I could drop everybody no problem with a BE laser. Then, my only gun that could kill was my TSE Gatling which was hit or miss. Then I started getting dropped by gangs of people using VATS Railroad and I just couldn‚Äôt put up with the more anymore. They ruined a fun asf game mode for some whining bitches lol
---
the story sounds super intriguing.  im not really into min/maxing so raids/events like this r extremely difficult or simply incomplete-able for me.  (what's this scorch queef everyone keeps talkin' bout?  im collecting souvenir cow refrigerator magnets!)
---
re: fetch quests.  thats super interesting the story &amp; player motivational elements (if i had time to read them w/o a something swacking my head, haha!), but i'll contend that some of the fetch criticism stems from the exclusive ways to 'solve' these quests.  that is to say, if it were possible to achieve quest stage completions thru (skill checks, alternate paths, unique consumable/items, etc) it would feel more "fleshed out."  as a corollary i might add that those alternate paths may not even be needed on a 'raid-type' mission so much as a go go go mentality....pass the lord, praise the ammunition!
---
nevertheless, thanks to your writeup, ill go give it another try today.  thanks wastelander, and may the odds be ever in your favor
---
I don't think Wastelanders will be paywalled. I would hope that Bethesda isn't that stupid. But I wouldn't be surprised if everything after it becomes "Expansion Packs" instead of DLC like they did with ESO and is behind a paywall.
---
Actually you will spend money on a snow machine I‚Äôll enjoy at your camp and save my money lmao
---
Be sure to apply the Contractor perk card, level 2, to reduce the amount of pure flux needed to construct the shower.
---
I had a beaver spawn at my camp that was unkillable, someone killed him w a tesla then he respawned and apparently that creates a super beaver
---
Main is 135 with 19k last time I checked, and my alt is 70 ish with 18k. I kinda stopped playing in the last month honestly, been on a MW grind.
---
yep..hate timers...never got far, so gave up.
---
This bug not being fixed was one of the major reason I quit the game. It became tediously frustrating to do literally anything.
---
ya stand fast is a pretty good peice for new characters
---
I‚Äôve had probably 3-4 times I‚Äôve gotten nukashine at someones punch bowl. Whenever I go to player vendors and they sell nuka shine I buy their whole stock to fill my own bowl up
---
level 5 scorched crippled me in 2 shots from a pipe pistol. I'd say you're right.
---
This is ligitness
---
There are xmas lights
---
I understand how to game the system thats not my point. When I made my post there were a bunch of people like "You can get Wes Tek its not even rare" and so forth. Its the pie from fallout, if its not a big deal to you yah probably haven't played much fallout.
---
true;  btw, abandond bogtown and spruce knobb have acid nodes also
---
\&gt; they removed cross map sniping. 
---
Could you explain this please?
---
Sorry I didn't know I'd need to elaborate. They nerfed it because it was the best mag, and you unlocked it before a different mag that was intended to be better. they brought it more in like with the other recievers. This way you can get a higher ammo capacity mag earlier on before you get the best mod, the stinging mag, the way the game intents for things to work.
---
Now *that* would be a Christmas miracle.
---
I wish they'd add real radio stations as an option or a music playlist that i upload.
---
I suggested this in another post with the same topic ‚Äî use whatever music streaming service you have on your console and find a fallout Christmas playlist! For example, I‚Äôm using Spotify on my ps4 and I found a few playlists that I‚Äôm just playing in the background. Try it out!
---
Brahmin milk, the endurance cards "SUNKISSED", and radsponge if you have a group. Get those cards or buddy up with a high lvl that'll share them
---
I see you lost it but at a low level or even mid level if you have other cards you have to grab before "Starched Genes" those will drop rads but let you keep muts
---
Yeah, but the event starts when you enter the area. You have the option then of firing the flare or ignoring the quest. If you don‚Äôt fire the flare in the time allotted the scorched just don‚Äôt come.
---
at  least camp does not get attacked by random nuisance
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ super beaver
---
Oh, thanks, but its sucks anyway üòæ
---
My camp is near the prime fissure site because i hunt scorchbeasts. What's your excuse?
---
nice...really like the flag mask!
---
\^this
---
The problem was BGS went overboard with the cap penalty.  While I agree that losing 500 caps isn't sustainable, it was nerfed to a ridiculous point.  But yes, two things which definitely kept PvE players off survival servers were fear of losing caps and fear of being marked on the map and hunted down.  Once both of those things had been nerfed.
---
You have made me rethink my position, though, and BGS also has to be factored into the equation for being over zealous with the caps nerf.
---
Quick fis: building mode, store turrt, then put it right back (that's what has been working for me) stay filthy!
---
You made that wayyy to complicated for bethesda. As with all new things camp related it will go into the atomic shop. Probably somewhere around 1500 atoms.
---
lol woops.
---
Well actually... :D There are always lvl1-6 scorched down there and they manage to destroy the fences, but the turrets are not reaching them and I'm too high up to build on the ground. Annoying
---
I know about the ranger gear, but what is the ncr armor?
---
nah, we get to iron out the horrible bugs afterwards :(
---
Completely wrong. The only reason they would or wouldnt do it, is because of paying for rights to said songs.
---
Dude, this person has put around 600 levels into this game. He's obviously a huge trader, he's an amazing unicorn who will trade weapons for caps. Jealousy is not a healthy quality.
---
Also Nuka Grape from a Whitespring vendor removes alot of rads, but never removes mutations
---
not at all..
---
Lever by far.  The assault rifle needs a big buff, it sucks right now.  The lever is the best sniper gun in the game.  For mid/close range, try to find a B25 Handmade, Fixer, or Combat Rifle.
---
I only run one character, lvl 251 with I think 16k caps currently.  I buy and sell a lot and usually stay around there.  I would stock up on 556 ammo for alt currency but I use a handmade lol.
---
How do you hear the toilet? I'm genuinely interested.
---
This checks out...
---
hehe... Shout guns...
---
yes, I get staggered a LOT...this is new. ALSO, my armor and weapons break WAY to quickly even with white knight 3 and gunsmith.  I used to be able to play for hours an my gear was still at 80%...now i need to repair like every hour.
---
I think they could be pushing the repair kits???!
---
INCREASED BUDGET.
---
This is all i want.
---
Oh, right, all of the above in post and comments.
---
Yeah I'm jealous because you're a losser with 15 character's, lmfao ü§Æ
---
What is your issue? Do you know how to make more than one email account? That's how easy it is to make another Microsoft account and gain 5 more sperate characters. 
---
Why would anyone bash this person even if they didn't explain **how** they have that many caps, most people actually **know** how to have that many. If there was any fault in his post it was assuming readers knew too.
---
I can't even.
---
Level 130 - 30.000,00 caps.
---
Damn! I play a lot and havent got a single Fixer!
---
I see you got your answer but here's an issue you might run into-
---
You won't be able to flip a wall that's connected to wall below it until you flip the bottom walls first.
---
where did you read this? whats the sale?
---
I‚Äôve got BE90 Gauss and BE 15 reload Lever, and I think the Gauss is pretty much trash (or a novelty) compared to the lever.  The lever will hit for 2K+, 1-shot 99% of the mobs in the game, has much lighter ammo than the gauss, doesn‚Äôt require you to cumbersomely charge the rifle, fires more quickly, etc.
---
There is almost zero situations where the Gauss is better.  The only time the Gauss is better is when you are trying to kill one single enemy by itself and nothing else and you don‚Äôt mind charging it.  
---
Even then it doesn‚Äôt hit much harder than the lever.  Considering the lever can 1-shot most 3* enemies anyway, I just don‚Äôt see a use for the Gauss.  I finally moved my Gauss back to my weapon mule, I don‚Äôt even want to bother carrying it anymore...even with 90% weight reduction. 
---
PS: Anyone want to trade for my BE90 Gauss on the PC? üòú
---
That just looks like it was a nightmare to build... have my updoot :D
---
*X doubt* id say a solide 2000 atoms
---
What do you think the effects of terlet sangria would be?
---
i already told u whats up
---
You bet it was :D but totally worth it
---
Gonna upvote because I've known people to go in hard and burn out. You've not given in entirely though, so I hope you come back with a different idea of what more this game can be :)
---
I started a month ago and im level 7 (i dont do a lot lmao) and i have like 37 caps from selling stuff at my camp near vault 76
---
Rofl i clearly must have misposted this. But thanks for the downvote!
---
np! didnt downvote though.  ill upvote though jow if it makes u feel better.  also hugs! ü§ó
---
What is your issue, he's stating he got 300k on 2 chars, im calling him out on it, he changes his post to include the fact he got 3 accounts, fair enough, but decides not to include the edit in his first post.
---
Oh and please do tell how i can make more accounts with microsoft on PC, sounds interesting
---
Yeah I have a LOT of gunpowder and lead but I haven't really needed to make any ammo yet..  I use a lot of shotgun and melee. People do seem to like that 5.56mm (and also the .45 cal)
---
This just isn‚Äôt true. You need to charge the Gauss to do decent damage.  This means the fire rate goes to shit compared to the lever.  Even when fully charged the Gauss does maybe 15% more damage than the lever, and the lever will already 1-shot 99% of the mobs in the game (assuming its bloodied or instigating).  I own the best/highest damage Gauss in the game (BE90) and I think it is garbage compared to my lever.  I don‚Äôt even carry the gauss any more,even with 90% weight reduction! It‚Äôs just useless compare to the lever. 
---
PS: Anyone want to buy my BE90 Gauss? ü§î
---
I have stimpacks. I gave one to my friend to revivw him yesterday! :/
---
Might give it a look. 
---
Been wanting to do a camp in a pre-exisiting building for ages but can never find one that suits my needs :/
---
100% more sexy times
---
I have FFR on a hunting rifle and the difference is very noticeable, especially with a hair-trigger receiver, but for some odd reason, the faster fire rate doesn't seem to work in third-person and only works in first person view.
---
I will have to jetpack up then :)
---
Hey moth man I saw your post while back about adding lgbt flags to camps I hope they do that
---
I have to admire the precision of this answer.
---
He was there
---
The two-shot prefix is pretty bad.  Not one I‚Äôd target. I‚Äôd much rather have an IE, BE, AAE, VE, FE, EE, etc. Handmade.
---
And I had that weather/skies mod that had upwards of 70 different weathers.  Thought they'd take more stuff from fo4.
---
Friction.
---
There is a few I like - check out the 3 holiday homes upwards from Bolton Greens. You can have a camp in the middle one. The left one is just far enough that the super mutants who spawn there do not attack you unless you do them, and 70%of the time one of them is a 3* legendary. They respawn every time someone fast travels there :)
---
Curious, do you mean picking the locks on world-containers at a workshop claimed by another player; or do you mean world-containers within the boundaries of another player‚Äôs camp?  I don‚Äôt know how many times I‚Äôve picked the lock of an world-container at another player‚Äôs camp (got to be dozens of times by now), but the action never marked me as wanted. Is this because I‚Äôm set to pacifist?
---
I‚Äôd go for 2* weapons until you find a decent one since the 3rd modifier is the least important on guns. Once you have a good day to day gun, then more to 3* to try to get a ‚Äúgod roll‚Äù gun.  During a purveyor sale though, I‚Äôd just go for 3*.  
---
With armor, go for 3* 100% of the time.
---
Levels 226, and 148.
---
80,000 caps total atm.
---
This.  Two of my turrets started fighting the other day.  Stored and reinstalled the aggro'd one and now eveything is fine.
---
Lv339 and 300,000
---
Yeah that's a constant problem when you have alot for sale in your camp, one way is to buy alot of ammo from other players, 5.56, .50 cal, 5mm and .308, they can be bought for 1 cap each most of the time, and you can then sell those when you're low on caps.
---
&gt; I am really, REALLY worried that Wastelanders is going to be paywalled. 
---
How would that work?  They'd have to maintain two versions of the game and they've shown that just keeping one of them going is a struggle.
---
Yeah its crazy what people pay for "legacy" weapons. Ive run into players with an entire duped inventory of them....theres certainly no shortage
---
It's happening to me on X-box.
---
preston liked that!
---
I have four @ 2k each
---
Yea i use 556 as a rainy day fund. I use handmades myself..but more and more have been switching to combat rifles. I have about 150k 556 storee right now. I just play the game and when i have enough mats saved up ill bang out 555 and add it to my bank lol. Between that, serums, and a couple characters full of weapons.
---
This. 
---
And ideally a popup that allows the defender to give up the workshop. This way the ownership would go instantly to the attacker and no PVP would get initiated...
---
Handmades are cheap compared to the plasmas.
---
Man, they are, so many have them.
---
He's talking about the shielded underarmour not the power armour plans, these can not be obtained through treasure maps
---
Yeah idk where they find all the sb lol.
---
It's sad really. I wonder what it would be like if duping never happened.
---
Grahm wasn't fond of the Scrapbot jokes.
---
I know what he‚Äôs talking about - Raider Shielded can be from treasure maps,  The rest can‚Äôt.
---
Ah gotcha, I thought it was only triggered by the flare.
---
Omg yes thissss
---
We are speaking Sniper. If I want DPS I grab my furious faster fire handmade. If I want deathblows I use the Unstoppable monster. If you want maximum damage you go instigating Gauss. If you want to tag and have fun, use a bloodied grenade launcher. 
---
Sniping is also about a playstyle, looks, pace, feeling, etc. And no, the lever action rifle might be better overall, but for sniping, the hunting rifle is better. It hits hard enough to be a certain 1 bullet = 1 kill. They do not do the same damage.
---
I'd like a complete and fixed game without paying 100 bucks per year.
---
&gt;11 lvls/day??
---
Meh, everything is worth what someone will pay. I bought an explosive railway rifle for 1500 caps a few days ago that'd I'd have paid a lot more for. You might find a rare plan for 100 caps or 1500 caps. There's no actual economy, if I'm short of caps and stash space, I'm probably willing to sell stuff under what I feel I could get.
---
Oh I've done around 20k maps and never seen one
---
Get out of here S.T.A.L.K.E.R.!
---
MkIII's can be bought from the Enclave vendor.
---
I mean, technically the scorched beasts arent avian, theyre bats, but bird enemies would be cool.
---
Impressive work, well done
---
W O W.
---
Because, by god, common sense be damned
---
Noticed this a couple of nights ago. Dropped a couple nukes and farmed them to completion. First nuke was awesome. Second time we decided for Harpers Ferry/ Burrows not a single legendary
---
Yes!
---
Oh, my bad... Keep on bulding cool stuff!
---
I hope this is added as a feature for private worlds soon, I can't tell you how many times I've wandered around, found a 3 star and for it to be really good but low level. I was around level 450 and found a level 35 Bloodied Explosive Lever Action.
---
In the school gymnasium on the north side of town. There‚Äôs a handful of Super Mutants around as well. Also two buses on the north side of the school, one of which has a Tinker‚Äôs Workbench. Plus a vendor bot back south in the main part of town in case you‚Äôre still overemcumbered. 
---
It‚Äôs like a 7-10 c FT from Vault 76, IIRC.
---
Depends what you are after
---
Suggestion: Try only hitting vend after looting everything possible off of uranium fever. Sell aid first, blood and glowing meat give a good bit, any chems you don't want. Then sell guns u picked up. If you wind up unable to sell anymore, scrap remaining guns using the scrapper perk and you're set for steel :)
---
This is how I get my "free" caps each renewal, if I don't get to a UF event, I don't usually bother either.
---
Dragons count as 4 separate hits right?
---
I carry multiple guns on my Rifleman characters (I have two), but none are a hunting rifle.  One carries a BE Lever and BE Handmade. The other carries a BE Laser Rifle, BE Fixer, B25 Fixer and a B25 Tesla. The second was going to be a pure energy rifle build, but then I realized the laser rifle was too likely to kill myself in tight quarters, and the Tesla not powerful enough...so I just passed over the fixers.
---
Wow, that is awesome ! ! !
---
Thanks I had no idea stuff scaled down to lower players some
---
I had someone 200 levels under me try and antagonize me for pvp yesterday while I was remodeling my camp. If they had a bounty like that, it would have been just antagonizing. It wouldve been murder. (They were level 60, I'm 260, and not a pvp'er)
---
*Ma'am, but thanks :)
---
Thank you! :)
---
Ye
---
Essentially how I feel about the red asylum uniform. Earlier this year, I bought one for 20k. Now the price has sky rocketed, and I have no idea why. It's so stupid, it's not like they changed anything with it. It's still just as rare now as it was back then, so there's no real logical reason (in my opinion) that an *outfit* would cost so damn much
---
It‚Äôs called a ‚Äúbeached whale‚Äù but your right
---
Totally true, but the OP doesn‚Äôt have a good weapon yet of any sort (I assume).  Until you get a decent 2* with a good prefix and exploding or FFR, he probably better off going with 2*.  After he has one of those, he can try for a god roll. 
---
During the purveyor sale though, it makes sense to go for 3* only, when you consider the discounted price to buy, and the 40 vs 15 scrip trade in value. It makes the net price of a 3* only 35 scrip vs 23 scrip for a 2*.  So with the 25% off sale, 3* weapons are selling for a net price equal to that of a non-sale 2* (35 scrip).
---
When a bottle cap mine is exploding it leaves caps if you collect it fast enough you get a miscellaneous item called caps.
---
It‚Äôs live!!!
---
The last time I played Shadow of Chernobyl got [this mod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQgPggTIniA) and it looked gorgeous. I really recommend it
---
Damn that is impressive.
---
People would be forced to actually play the game?
---
Folks have run out of rare things to chase, and supply on those hasn't really increased. that's my guess.
---
"Objects can not be floating" "Objects can not intersect another"... why cant the damn rules be clear? Green outline should me it can be placed... christ...
---
Got 1.1mil saved up rn, my main is level 90 now. But my original character is around level 220 IIRC.
---
I have never seen that before...but the animation leads me to believe it is indeed caps for caps
---
Very nice.
---
Nah, that 2x what it should be, they usually go for 2.5k to 3k
---
Did anyone call Geraldo Rivera?
---
Hm?
---
OP has def been locked up. Lol
---
This sauce was delicious. Thank you for the sauce. ü§§
---
How would workshops work?
---
I had this happen when a super mutant killed me with a Molotov and I respawned at the fast travel point that was nearby. (I think my old body was still burning)
---
I loved it because, not only was I on fire but I would phase in and out of existence (sadly it didn't help sneak).
---
I called it the Burning Phantom.
---
Would love to get radboars.
---
Good call, it's always handy to have some atoms saved up for a quick buy. Same with scrip, I try to always keep a little in the bank
---
&gt; 1st) Multicamp:
---
How about fuck no?
---
&gt; (ATOM) Wind driven water pump
---
How is this any better then just going to water and spamming the button to pick some up? "But radiation"... yeah, trivial to get rid of...
---
I was going to say hot cross buns
---
I would love a Christmas Radio Station and snow for our camps &lt;3 along with the Christmas lights! Would be a lot of fun!
---
It‚Äôs been a while since I have seen it.I will go look to see if I can find it again,probably be tomorrow.I will try to take a pic or at least get exact directions..
---
You have a lot of object placement that the game has always told me is not allowed. The rules of what the camp can and cant do are fuzzy at best, and it is annoying as shit.
---
Unfortunately I have none.
---
Baking Brownies.
---
That is such a great photo
---
I thought they stopped the whole nuking the Burrows, legendary thing a month or so after it came out, because of people farming the legendaries. I know there for a while we would nuke it and nothing would happen after they patched it.
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
The perils of live tv! Lol
---
that's way cool
---
Start over.
---
Not the person who originally asked the question, but am also still confused.  You say you have 300K caps spread across 2 accounts.  But the cap max per account is 30,000 so the most that should be able to be hoarded across 3 characters is 90,000.
---
That is very cool. As much as it seemed to be a substitute for a lot of more traditional story-based content, I really do like that Fallout 4 introduced the settlement building aspect into the series.
---
The build galleries and videos made a single-player game feel more social and now that naturally has evolved with 76.
---
Damn this is creative!
---
I didn't use any glitches other than placing rugs on top of stash boxes. But I would call that rather resourceful then cheating :D So the point is everything that is placed here is placed here because the game allowed it - just try to play around with items until they find their place :)
---
Also the dense mod for the robot amor (although somewhat rare) has great protection for explosives like cars and players with explosive weapons. Having that on top of fireproof will make you almost invincible to any explosion. If you happen to be on PS4 I have a mod lying around that I would be willing to give.
---
Yep, happens sometimes when using VATS with melee on flying things like bloodbugs or even fireflies, i call it the blind mode, i remember using my buddy as my eyes so we could end the lighthouse event xD only way to fix it is restarting the game, sadly.
---
Mr. Fuzzy ride on style
---
There's a place in the south of the map where I put one of my camps, only for the view.  It was on the side of a large hill and if you made the camp near the top you'd have an excellent view.  Sometimes I'd just idle and enjoy the view for a few minutes here and there.
---
haha, what did it taste like? asking for a friend...
---
I sell all those drink recipes for 500 caps.
---
Maybe they should re texture the top of the world and add snow to it, then maybe gives us bonus awards from wearing the skiing outfits? That would be fun as hell imo.
---
What the other guy said and Robo Research Center, Charleston capitol building spawns high level ghouls and there are always some legendaries, Fort Defiance. Scorchbeasts can be legendary now so the Cranberry Bog is a good place to farm them.
---
Thanks :) Originally it's not my idea to build up there but the execution is all me
---
I find the weapon wheel hard to use on a PS4 altogether.   Maybe I‚Äôm just not fast enough to use it in real time situations.
---
Too bad :( I always love to see other cool camps
---
The game/servers could not handle anything remotely close to that lol, but it is a cool idea.
---
There are some places with several world spawns near each other that make farming them pretty easy. Top of the world and its surounding area have like 4 or 5 and at least 2 of them are always there when I look after them.
---
I want prebuilt houses and buildings in the same vein as the greenhouse and camper we got. Then I can burn my budget on decorating and defense.  I like all your ideas btw. Good stuff
---
How did you get up there and build it in the first place?
---
Also my camp is near the crashed space station cause there's a junk and lead deposit I sit on
---
63 or 96? Or is this some wind up bullshit? Because I've been getting more and more worried that the other vaults would just be left as they still haven't fully fixed 94.
---
Funny thing is, you actually don't die when you get off, just float in the air :D You can just jump back on the rugs or move and then fall down
---
Another aspect is that not everyone wants to have 5 toons just to be able to save more than the cap limit allows. Making some players completely unable to trade for those items.
---
Great idea, looks amazing. Wish I was PSN to see it
---
 Nicely done, too bad I‚Äôm on Xbox.
---
Critical hit them like literally, when you use VATS there is a little meter at the bottom once it's full you can fire a critical shot which cause a critical hit...
---
That‚Äôs very convenient! If you have marsupial you could just jump right back to your camp from it.
---
I've never bought from him before, but I hear you should go for 2 star instead of 3 star range weapons when buying. Is this true?
---
never said you cheated. You made use of the system and its great, i am just angry that the camp system basically requires such tricks and often times will trick you saying you can place something visually, but then says no doe some stupid reason like "Object is floating".... I just want a more free building system.
---
Oh I am all for fallout 4! Love to build in it, different style cities and villages and farms and factories.. I'm actually quite sad that you can't have multiple camps here.
---
You need to use Vats criticals.  Go into vats and fill up the critical bar. Press corresponding button and boom, vats critical!
---
Yeah, I agree with you. Honestly, it could probably use a rework. Even quick switching to my last used weapon isn't always the last used weapon. It's irritating lol
---
Exactly. I don‚Äôt see any edit to your comment and I recall you mentioning three accounts when I first saw the comment. 
---
He‚Äôs got a chip on his shoulder and it‚Äôs adorable.
---
My camp is in the ash heap, so I don‚Äôt think it would do much for me.
---
I described it already in one of the earlier comment threads :) I can't get to the ground, so no resources for me :D
---
The second star is primarily what makes the weapon. Either Faster fire rate, Explosive, Swing Speed, or power attack damage
---
I tried the Gauss, hated it.  Its funky.  It fires weird.
---
Its an aquired taste, and does not have the reload fire 1 shot mechnic that sets the lever above the rest.
---
Yeah :( but thanks!
---
Yeah there is a farming spot near vault tec uni.
---
didnt even think of that. good idea!
---
Wouldn't that be kind of ideal if you were farming the Fixer plan or imposter outfit?
---
Wow that looks good as well.
---
Going to have to download it.
---
Fallout 76 really needs mods.
---
How much will it cost?
---
ü§£üòÇüëå
---
We already had a nuclear "winter" I want Santa Claws. The death claw stuck in a santa outfit with a mutants meatball, chained to his leg hes dragging. Maybe have him delirious and chasing bees, but one is Bugthesda'ed out and flashes red. That's what I want!
---
I had the same reaction to the Gauss, its just a weird weapon, novelty of sorts.
---
Shh! i dont want them to nerf that one as well.
---
Correct, I have 15 characters and a theoretical cap of 450K.  I actually play 5 of the characters (and have active in-game vendors for them), so I try to keep their caps under 15K.  So 300K is about as high as I like to have, and I‚Äôm currently trying to spend caps on trade list quality gear to get down to a more comfortable 200K.  That‚Äôs about where I like to be, and I‚Äôm very uncomfortable when I get below 100K.  I figure I should always have enough caps on hand to buy any single great item I find for caps.
---
Oh yeah. I scrapped back at least 3 times because it showed I'll be able to place something and then I couldn't, then of course the server crashed and I couldn't get up yet :D Fallout 4 building was way better, that's for sure, even if that was buggy too.
---
* Power Armor displays. I wouldn't even care if they used the assets from FO4. It's crazy that we still don't have them considering how often people ask for them. 
---
* Armor mannequin displays, again from FO4's assets. 
---
* Cat bowl that spawns domesticated kitty that can roam around your camp.
---
* Non-broken/dirty appliances like toilets and TVs. Why would our characters bother building a toilet if it's all busted up and broken? lol
---
* Inverted roof corners
---
* I disagree with the variable budget suggestion since it seems pretty arbitrary in terms of what's considered a pre-existing object and it would completely ruin some solid locations. I'd much prefer the budget increase as you level up, even beyond 50+. I think if you've put in the time and effort to get to level 200+ you should be able to build more than someone who's only level 60 or so. 
---
* Remove those damn petrified corpses sitting around everywhere. We're re-building Appalachia and I highly doubt we'd leave the dead remains of people just sitting in the middle of every road. lol
---
* Jukeboxes that play the same music as the radios.
---
* More display shelves. In fact, just turn all of the items listed under the "Shelf" category into displays.
---
* Don't make the items we put on the displays count towards our budget.
---
* More crop choices. I want a pumpkin patch, dammit. 
---
* Spiral staircases
---
* Reduce the amount of budget a turret consumes, for God's sake. 
---
* Nuka Cola display shelf
---
That's all I've got for now. Love most of your suggestions!
---
I want to put wallpaper on both sides of a wall
---
You can milk anything with nipples.
---
Apprentice the detailed description, only wish I was psn now as your camp is amazing
---
Lvl 90+ 
---
Think I have 10k+
---
this is a ducking stupid post. toilets only good for cereal.
---
I prefer the Gatling laser, actually. Doesn‚Äôt have a splitter and thus will do less dmg and heal less compared to a Gatling plasma. However, I just love the accuracy and how well it handles. Feels right for some reason. 
---
I can easily take a pylon during encryptid event with the VE Gatling laser. I just run up to the imposter and stand right in front of him and hold down fire. Health remains at full, even though he blasts you with his own, very deadly laser. 
---
I‚Äôve tested them for pvp and for this the Gatling plasma outperforms the Gatling laser by a country mile.
---
Wish they had more full face wrap bandana styles other than the flag one.
---
Yeah just restarted playing fallout 4 with true weather mods and it's absolutely amazing how they haven't implemented this in base game is beyond me
---
Maybe ash instead of snow like the first David Tennant Christmas Dr Who?
---
This is such a cool idea
---
I started out on Xbox One with Fallout 4 and I enjoyed building, but didn't like the limits.
---
After switching to PC and removing the limits with mods - as well as adding a bunch of new items with mods, I really got into it.
---
Some of the turrets that modders came up with were absolutely diabolical.
---
r/OPGotDownvoted
---
There's no need to be so rude about it.
---
Wtg, please send them more money now!
---
There are no mods on xbox? That's too bad. I love mods, there is a hunch on ps4. I also played on pc for a bit but then changed to console - more convenient for me
---
We will at least get a Atom Shop refresh today. Im guessing they will add another 1st Exclusive Ranger Variant to try and get people to resub seeing as anyone on monthly that signed up Day One and didnt setup recurring would have expired by now. I'm going to guess it will be the Desert variant.
---
It's Christmas at Ground Zero!
---
guessing in 7 minutes?
---
12:00 is still seven minutes away.
---
To farm the plan and outfit For some people it might be good if the boss is weakened by not being legendary , but for for me or my friends its not good at all , we have experience on the event and all we need is one or two of us taking all the poles once this is done the other one focus on dealing damage the sheep goes down really fast once the shield is off so if the boss is not legendary it's just a lose of scrip for us
---
it doesnt start till Noon eastern.
---
6 more minutes.
---
Had this happen faster than 4 hours. Had only been on a Private instance for about an hour and no Legendaries from Leader of the Pack or Uranium Fever.
---
wtf is this?
---
Only pyschos make these type of posts
---
Now 5
---
That's clearly a statistically significant sample size.
---
Song from Appalachia Radio stuck in my head
---
Well since your on console, the only thing you can do really is be sure your PS4 is running "normally".
---
Do you have your console in a tightly confined space, cabinet, entertainment cabinet, etc ? Make sure its actually running cool so it doesn't throttle your processor speeds. 
---
Really thats all that can be done. Ive heard the game runs like shit on console.
---
Tractor milk is questionable.
---
Lol I know that trader.
---
4 mins
---
Shhhh. Then it will cost atoms.
---
My Ign on PC is Bobbabas if you want one I can give you one for free :)
---
It‚Äôs your mutations. Possibly plague walker.
---
How does one get so many alts to that high of a level? Leveling tips?
---
There are more mods on Xbox One than on PS4, but PC has the most and the best.
---
I had some .50-cal sniper turrets in Sanctuary that caused some really interesting interactions with the spawning code.
---
It seemed that spawning of raids at a settlement you're currently in is controlled by render distance. Due to the range of my sniper turrets, they could engage unrendered enemies because they were there but not yet within sight of me.
---
When a deathclaw raid was sent at Sanctuary, my sniper turrets kept pummeling them while I worked on something outside render distance from the spawn point.
---
When I finally went over to check what was wrong because the turrets were within render distance and, thus, I could hear them pounding away, I found a pile of dead deathclaws in the river.
---
It was wild.
---
Happened a few other times with those modded turrets, but never with deathclaws again.
---
lvl 440.  21k
---
Should this be reported or does it even matter anymore?
---
New at 6, Leading cause of death among 18-36 year olds is a drinking game aimed at bugs in a video game.
---
26 seconds
---
Lol, the floral?
---
Most excellent! I could be wrong since i havnt played the game in a minute, but i wish the game granted you access to building where ever you wish like in a town. I dont recall the town, but there was one spot in a sky scraper that over looked a valley
---
I wonder if it's because the server isn't seeing new people. No idea how the legendary scripts work server side, but I'm starting to think maybe it's designed to only spawn a set number per player that enters (or maybe rolls for a number each time a new unique player enters). It might explain why some servers are so hot and others are shit. The hot servers might have a lot of unique players entering. A private server with the same person or small group playing for hours would go cold if this was how it worked.
---
Tyty i just managed to get the free wallpaper two minutes before it was gone for my bro.
---
Lol
---
But it‚Äôs high in iron content. 
---
Good for the blood.
---
That‚Äôs awesome!!!
---
I really, really hope that's something that they have planned. I would love it!
---
In another (now deleted) thread, someone reported the Vault 96 door glitching. This post might be related to that. Although it seems doubtful the vault would actually be opened with no announcement, or patch download.
---
They also have a costume animation when you look at them in your pipboy, they kinda fly through the screen.
---
hehe cutting it close, but you got it :-) not a bad wallpaper to be honest.
---
What?
---
With "Secret Agent" a Mk3 lasts 6 minutes.
---
And maybe a temporary cryptid... like a rad stag that has a glowing nose and an abominable snowman.
---
And like, a bloated ghoul Santa or something!
---
Its really good to give it a modern ish feel, love to combine it with red nuka cola posters and the oil lamp post light giving it a amazing look
---
Is that for all the drink recipes or just the nuka dark?
---
But you can kill the queen with it in 30 seconds and deny everyone else at the Scorched Earth event an event reward because they didn't do enough damage in the 30 seconds it took you to kill her with your duped legacy.
---
Everyone will envy you and your awesome duped weapon that you used to fuck them out of a reward.
---
Several on eBay UK, maybe in your location, about ¬£20
---
Yeap blair mountain is gone cuz that was a bug
---
I have 5 accounts (and possibly an unhealthy obsession with fallout games). I have a certain quest path I take and it takes me about 3-4 days to hit level 50 (6-8 hrs a day). I can do a short write up about the steps I take if you are interested.
---
Ok ty Ill pass on that vendor for sure then.
---
havent had time to renovate yet but I'll love posters so its going to be a proper gloomy mancave!
---
i just  buy what i want that is it lols
---
They just added a red free wallpaper!
---
shit, have to login and check now!
---
I invest in everything, I have sold .45 and fusion cores, I try to sell everything at some price. Probably my best seller overall is stimpaks followed by lead.
---
There's nothing illigal about it, it's basicly the same kind of item as a snallygaster spit attack explosion.
---
You can get them by just picking up bottlecap from bottlecap mines.
---
Main is 322, I have 3 other alts in the 100s and another that is lvl 90ish. Have around 70k account wide.
---
You can place 6 items. :)
---
Exploring Appalachia almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter
---
Go check out the uncanny caverns! You can walk the wooden path with the normal tour.
---
Explore THREE WHOLE CAVES with the Wild cave explorer premium pass.
---
Delve through devils pass with the ‚Äúadventure upgrade pass‚Äù
---
Both purchase-able in the gift shop.
---
He can buy five stimpaks from me!
---
2 on each shelf. :)
---
Fireman Responder Uniform drops from all Forest  events, although chance is so small, that I haven't found any playing since BETA across two platforms...
---
Fair enough, do you know where is it supposed to be now? I restarted and wanted the keys again
---
Man that's devotion. Can you just give a cliff's notes summary?
---
It is really is shit i shouldve buy the pc version instead. It‚Äôs on a table with a decent amout of spacing. I have it vertically with a cooling stand. Reduced the FOV to the lowest and remove pipboy animation when activating menu.  That‚Äôs all i can do to make it snappy
---
Please accept my humblest of apologies M'lady. I grovel at the base of your water tower abode.
---
he never stated he only had 2 characters with a single account. 
---
His original unedited post says 3 accounts.
---
Learn to read, and learn to accept when you are wrong and an entire community corrects you.
---
You were wrong.  Accept it and move on.
---
Might you need solve some puzzles. check youtube
---
6, two on each shelf.  The bottom shelf can support fairly tall things, but anything larger than a teddy bear will clip through the shelves above it on the upper four slots.
---
He didnt change his original post or reddit would have published an edit tag on the post. 
---
There is no edit tag.
---
All I need is a balaclava
---
I'm running the same armor and weapons now for a few months, I just enjoy the game, but I'm PVE so I suppose PVP is where all this meta stuff and high prices is at.
---
guess I'll do a seedy brothel in the near future ;-p
---
When survival was still up and running, we considered becoming Wanted a tip. We'd just kill the wanted teammate and then the caps would be split. The guy with the bounty even got a cut (not because we gave it to him, the game split it among the team, including him, lol).
---
Or asbestos perhaps?
---
I haven't logged on in a week... Is it snowing?!
---
Sounds like you have plaguewalker on.
---
Check your muties.
---
Nice
---
There should be a way so send the player real money as tribute to their awesomeness ü§Æ
---
Unfortunately not, but that would be cool! :D Just one of those super foggy days
---
That's insane. I farm the biv recipes and sell them all for 250 caps and they usually take a few days to sell at that.
---
When I tried raising it to 500 caps nobody bought them, not even the nuka dark.
---
Shit you did waay more than most people would. Lowest FOV would help but clearly hasn't much in your case. And a cooling fan on top of that pretty much tells me this is a Bethesda issue. 
---
But we know how well Beth does with bugs.... And to be fair even my rtx 2070 has choppy frames due to just how shitty the game engine is. So it's a Beth thing, nothing can be done.
---
Being in passive will not keep you from getting a bounty.  It won't keep you from getting killed afterwards either.
---
you are obviously a newbie to reddit, no edit is asterixed when done within 2 min of orig. post.
---
You are wrong, accept it, and stop posting on stuff you clearly have NO insight into.
---
have a nice day
---
Damn, got my hopes up with all this "snow" talk I just saw on the front page of the sub lol
---
Don't be daft, this game is Duping76 with the DLC of Trading76.
---
Love the Mr. Fuzzy ride hanging out there like the  [X Scream](http://millionstarhotel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/stratosphere-x-scream.jpg) on the Stratoshpere in Vegas!
---
The only thing that I've seen in the gift shop is random junk and mole rats.
---
Thank you
---
Graham is the best, he saved my ass the other day.
---
Next time ill be sure to lower my expectations.
---
Go to Sunnytop Station.  There's some bowls of soup in the bathroom, a few empty bowls, and a ladle in the toilet.
---
I normally get terrible guns, and when I get a good gun, I only get good guns, like fixers, handmades, and combat rifles
---
Never had that one ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I'm not certain of that. I have mixed results though honestly. Most I've pulled out of there was like 4
---
Nope never had that mutation üòé
---
I'm sure they'll surprise us with something for christmas. Let's don't loose hope! :D
---
Damn! Bethesda really fck this one up. It‚Äôs probably the game itself. I hope they bring stability fix to this. 
---
There‚Äôs nothing more we can do. Thank you
---
I'm pretty sure that's what gave me the idea.
---
Thanks for sharing, shame the new stuff still seems to be inspired by Fortnite more than Fallout though.
---
Just a wild ride :) tho I would never ever go on the real life one :D
---
It's an event that takes less than a second to complete for anyone over level 50, so it's probably just gone before you've seen it.
---
On PC there's a mod called event notifications that tells you when every event starts (even the non public event ones) and I see Fly Swatter pop up all the time.
---
It starts with a key you get next to the Alien Blaster. It‚Äôs an unmarked quest, so you won‚Äôt get any waypoints to the next step.
---
I got the responders helmet from Bots on Parade down in the ash heap.
---
His post was made 2 hours ago.
---
Do you not know how to read a post details?
---
Edit:
---
Just want to say ur videos r awesome
---
Stealth boys should be disabled in PVP. Most games give you 3 seconds cloak maximum
---
Sure!
---
Head to Flatwoods and do starter quests, hit Morgantown and finish those (do all side in areas). 
---
When you hit Charleston grab all the side quests and firebreathers. Hit the Mistress of mystery at this point. After firebreathers hit Lewiston and get all of the encryptid and side quests. 
---
Hit up Rosie and also start Modus line. You should be in the early to mid 20's. Start Miner Miracles at this point. You want to have mistress of mystery and modus working together (both at WS and have both when you hit sugar grove). 
---
After you finish all sides finish out BOS (remember you can go straight to Glassed cavern during belly of the beast you do NOT have to follow the little com sites). 
---
Finish out by Nuking and you should be pretty close.
---
Her.
---
Normally you want to go for two star (although you could try three if you already have a two star you like), you get more rolls.
---
But when she's selling at half price it could be worth trying for three star:
---
You buy a 3\* at 50 scrip, chuck it in the machine and get 40 scrip back if you don't like it, a loss of 10 scrip.
---
Or you could buy a 2\* at 25 scrip, chuck it in the machine and get 15 scrip back, also a loss of 10 scrip.
---
So you get about the same number of 3\* rolls as you do 2\*.  (Although it will take longer, as you don't get to scrip as many 3\* per day).
---
Oh OK!
---
Thank you. I do appreciate these :)
---
What makes it Black Friday sale anyway? all I see is stuff in the Black Friday tab which is original price as it was when it came out.
---
Thought Black Friday meant KILLER savings?
---
+ 200% unarmed, -10 INT, +3 random diseases, + 200% health, force blurry/wobbly vision, force remove all clothing and armor, every character model for 2 minutes is replaced with Prison Marshals. Always wake up in jail cell in Monongah.   "Toilet Tonic" 
---
 Prison Riot in a Jar¬©
---
Yeah how much are they going to charge us for it?
---
Yeah thanks, just found the YouTube Vid üëç
---
Welcome to the club. I have a zerker too. Quick tip, psycho and med x addiction both lower damage resistance so you can wear a shielded underarmor or use nerd rage.
---
I jumped the barriers while the tour-guide was busy with some molerats! Saved a few caps!
---
Weird, there must be an invisible surface surrounding the cable.
---
when will the 1st subscribers get new stuff? is it once a month or?
---
That PA paint looks nice tbh
---
No new fallout first stuff?
---
Isnt it a 25% off sale? 3* would be 75 scrip, not 50.
---
I find that people just don't buy things in general - even at 10 caps I'm drowning in Plans I can't get rid of.
---
That was my guess too
---
booya. the backpack is on sale! also anyone kno w whats in the plushie bundle? thx fer the post
---
So Blackbird PA paint is 1440 now instead of 1800. Well, that's the one black friday deal lol
---
Nothing new for 1st?
---
I'd love to see a real "survival" mode with boosted enemies and xp like +25 lvls to all enemies across the map and such would be more fun then the old survival (troll fest) server
---
I use what I find, never found an aae handmade.
---
Farm scorch beasts they have like a 50% chance of being legendary now so it‚Äôs really good for script
---
Those ghouls and wendigo WERE PEOPLE! It's not so absurd to believe that maybe they are the remnants of BOS people who have lost their minds and went feral. Then one of them started eating the others.
---
"How much are you willing to pay us to get a non-bugged product?" - Bethesda
---
Nope
---
You‚Äôre mad!
---
Mine started blasting sound waves from the mouth if anyone acted out. It was impressive! But not as impressive as ODINS TOOTH. Appalachia‚Äôs  LARGEST natural cave column!
---
no new stuff this week
---
You didn't witness ALL of them die.
---
My melee weapons have always done that. I even get it where I try to punch something in vats 5 times and have no effect. It will show I am doing damage with the numbers from settings, I have even had this problem in nuclear winter against players. Rarely I get it where vats in my weapons won't do anything especially with a gauss rifle, I will have 95% and it will shoot through the monster everytime.
---
many thanks!
---
Simple answer: No
---
It was not a stealth boy, he was completely invisible
---
On xbox its LB to enter vats, press Y to use the critical shot, right trigger to shoot it. Its like a quick 1 2 3.
---
Thanks! I'll give it a try.
---
Oh same, I've been playing Berserker since Beta, use Level 1 armor with your addictions, you can get a shielded marine wetsuit and all lvl 1 leather limbs without armor mods.
---
From what I‚Äôve seen just the nuka dark
---
Complicated answer: Still No
---
You mean Helsinki Syndrome?
---
yep -- was right to skip it, not my cup'o'tea
---
Ok thanks guys
---
Yeah, but that would require a lot more effort than bethesda is willing to put in
---
This is the only correct answer here. **Farm. Scorchbeasts.** I'm drowning in legendaries and I don't even farm particularly hard.
---
I see about 12 per day
---
Typhoid Mary, is that you...?
---
TBH being forced into the stinging mag for me showed me the buff the mag gives but for non armoured the drum would be better!
---
That was me btw - I got DC'd for reasons related to my personal internet - then the guy I was watching it sent me screenshots of getting a quest marker on his map and UI for starting it.
---
if they never get anything , itll be exactly what is deserved for supporting such a cancerous program
---
I've had the same happen for me on &amp; off for awhile. Mutant hounds seem most susceptible in my case, about 1/3 of the time I enter a location with them they all keel over &amp; make a buncha dying sounds simultaneously. Only way I get around it seems to be new server.
---
It might have glitched but we have screenshots. The juiciest of them which show the quest markers and quest activation text such are not mine so I'll have to ask to share.
---
I had a number of new people join and leave the second time.
---
Yeah, I fucked up.
---
Unless the prices are meant to change for Black Friday - notice limited time is like 3 days on those?
---
I play the game differently then I guess. Dunno
---
If you find one let me know, been an issue for me through multiple camp moves since about 5 months ago. I shelled Summersville and then after that it never let me use artillery again. Same message as you're getting.
---
Level 125 300 saved
---
Totally random. Sometimes every fift enemy is a legendary and sometimes hours without one. I try to farm common legendary spots
---
I remember seeing snow in game a while back, I recorded it because I thought it was weird
---
Go to events
---
Grafton day dropped helmet for me
---
It was like that for me as well (similar progression/play style).
---
That said, there were always a couple of places where I would likely find them at that level, although I rarely did things like server hop for them. On the back side of Sal's Grinders in Beckley, I frequently had a legendary gutsy show up, or inside on the second floor, there might be a ghoul. Obviously Uranium Fever has them, but I got destroyed there when I tried (I spawned back and finished them off). Hornwright Estate usually had one as well, level 20 something.
---
So, they're around, but I definitely run into them more frequently now that I'm level 127. I started running around in the Mire and the Bog around level 60, so that obviously increased their numbers. It's fun to take them on, but I'm fine if I go hours without running into them.
---
Use a shot gun, get up close, every pellet that hits counts as 1 critical hit.
---
At least now you get a notification is starting no matter where you are.
---
Uranium fever
---
Heaps. Just have to know where to look. Good rule of thumb is that every major location has a chance to spawn 1 out of the group. If that "faction" has legendary in the pool. Gouls and supermutants prob spawn the most. I don't think scorched spawn legendary tho could be wrong.
---
Biger pockets of them are found at wes tec/ White springs/ DMV/ harpers ferry. Trick is to make a mental note when you find one outside of the main areas and form a route.
---
But
---
I traded a bloodied explosive minimum for a furious handmade and 3 pieces of weapon weight reduction armor. We both came out ahead in that because I had I gun I could use and all the weapon weight reduction pieces.
---
Regular plans are worthless, I dumped all of mine. You can see the Halloween stuff going for audacious caps. Hell I have the pumpkin jump suit for 10k. It's not worth that but eventually someone will pay it.
---
 I doubt a Vampire will save you. I use BOS Heavy Combat myself. ;)
---
There is power armor that adds more resistance than ultracite, I think the 51 power armor gives the most resistances
---
Maybe you stepped on them ?
---
Yeah, it looks great but the music clashes badly with the vending machine tunes. I ended up scrapping mine as well, as it wouldn't stay off...
---
What? No... the only way to score a Critial Hit is in VATS by manually triggering a Crit when the meter is full
---
No ones has information it seems I've been scanning everywhere for like 3 days lol. Just ended up deleting it. Might send a ticket to Beth and see what happens
---
Give it a rest man. Those opinions are *sooo* last month.
---
nothing
---
Atomic shop
---
Atoms Shop. It's under CAMP. It came out in the summer, was vaulted, came back as part of the bundle again for the day the bombs dropped, and then continued to be on there. I think it still is? Idk.
---
Seems to depend on the server somewhat.  Sometimes I'll find them all over, other times I'll never run across any outside of events.  That said do certain events whenever they pop up and you will be visiting the scrip machine constantly to get rid of legendaries. 
---
Do uranium fever, one violent night, sbq fights, Awol armaments among others whenever you see them pop up.  Mostly all free to fast travel to events.
---
Sorry should have been clearer assumed everyone would know how to trigger a crit. Have updated.
---
That works.
---
Is that Sienna wallpaper the freebie this week?
---
I was hoping they'd bring back the raider PA I like the shadow liberty prime but man does it get old fast
---
I think it was even better - 85. I loved it on my furious handmade so I could bullethose every member of mobs without reloading.
---
Real life ones look like that when some doofus takes the cover off and loses it. They never made one officially like that.
---
Traveling by foot can massively increase your odds. High level/density zones like Harper's and SW/NW of Watoga. When I do my digestested goo route I run in to 3-6 legendaries.
---
It's with 2* weapons, unless you are looking to trade them. A weapon only having 2*s makes it. A lot less valuable to traders
---
Armor you should always go 3* as you can't get a cav or sent 2*
---
Durning a sale go 3* as you get better scrip return
---
Not sure, maybe Bethesda forgot the meaning of Black Friday?
---
Weird. I expected at least some of the datamined paint/skins that are already in game.
---
They better not try to sell us the damn ranger armor paint again or I will flip.
---
It is!
---
thank you, :) I have no idea about VATS. I never normally use it
---
If you're on PC there's a mod (several actually) to put the full dust cover and top handguard on the auto handmade if you don't like this look.
---
thank you :)
---
This is my fo76 user, i've been here for alot longer on my main, lol
---
now go away, and simply accept that im right, and you are not
---
They can give us limited outfits like elder coat or mechanist Atleast
---
So long as the wanted player loses caps, the bounty hunter gains them.  It's an equal exchange no way to game it.
---
Thanks heaps
---
Agreed.
---
Thanks so much :) 
---
How do I fill the meter I never normally use VATS?
---
GT?
---
Personally I nuke it cause it's just crying out for a good bombing.
---
THOTpatrol78
---
Me gonna spend some atoms.
---
Just so you know that helmet is not a diving bell, but a diving helmet
---
A diving bell is basically a giant bell without a clapper that holds a pocket of air that is lowered down so that you can swim in and out of to take a breath, very old school method of diving
---
 Outside of events it's kind of hit or miss on finding them while exploring. I spend most of my time in the Mire/Bog area and most of the legendaries I kill while exploring are scorchbeasts.
---
Damn. 250! Been farming and selling for 100. Time to hike my prices I think.
---
31 and 523 caps.
---
I don't think it works at all with gauss rifle because it doesn't speed up the charging.
---
Except you are not.  The whole community has tried to explain this. 
---
You are just too hard headed and full of yourself to understand that.
---
Okay, we‚Äôll patrol the waste looking for Thots!
---
What platform are you on?
---
I'm dying. Came here to pretty much reply with the same joke. But "how do i delete my character" kills me.
---
Usually on after work as well around 6 EST
---
If it starts playing Christmas music I'll level the place.
---
I answered before to another user: the lever is the best rifle overall, no doubt about it. 
---
I have shot the other weapons, I don't like explosive weapons even when I have several. 
---
Thanks for the offer. I have sold some weapons like the ones you have. Even when it shouldn't be like that, the bloodied HR is better than the instigating one.
---
fuck right off
---
I already do little quests to unlock the content doing my dailies and other atom challenges, i really don‚Äôt want to have to do more just for some random poster set or lamp i unlock
---
Just fyi, but scorched do spawn legendary on occasion. I had two this weekend. One at the rest stop in the Mire, 2\*. The other one, 3\*, was on the top floor of the Watoga Civic Center, which is a pretty well known spawn point for them. I got a Junkie's swing speed death tambo from the former, and some forgettable 2\* armor from the latter.
---
Sounds like a plan chief
---
I‚Äôll play with ya my dude. Always looking for new people to play with
---
Broken for me.  I had to redo my CAMP and when I went back to place this item from storage it is broken.
---
Alright sick! Add me and shoot me a message!
---
That could be it too.  But I‚Äôm not biting until I see reduced prices.  It‚Äôs not Black Friday yet, at worse those items will disappear for a time and return again.
---
I have a vampire, swing speed combat knife and I take little to no damage from the mob of golf club ghouls because it‚Äôs such a fast weapon. I also have a vampires deathclaw gauntlet that hits harder but slower so enemies do get the chance to whittle down my health with that. So I think with vampires the rule of thumb is go fast or go home!
---
A nice bloodied .50cal and xo-1 with emergancy protocols should do fine
---
What are your special stats
---
I'm usually in excavator. With incisor3, glowsight3, martial artist3, and a dose of gladiator for good measure, it does indeed take out the mob.  That's one reason I've kept it so long.
---
Or we can keep all the quest free
---
Honestly, most often pretty tasteless. Unless the brahmin had garlic. Or so I've heard...
---
Thank you for this!!
---
15 STR, \~10 INT, a bit less AGI and low PER and CHR (2 respectively 3). Can't recall 100% since I'm at work
---
To be honest, one of my favourite ones is the .38 fixer. I don't need extreme damage output. Multipliers do most of the job.
---
I know what ya mean.  I was forced into being a lone wanderer mostly. Lol
---
Bloodied means that I need to  be low health at most times to get the benefit right? I do have XO-1 PA, but what are emergency protocols? Thanks!
---
Wait is this an actual thing?
---
Must be your machine, I had zero issues with the Halloween event
---
I bought one awhile back, much better than my tse handmade, especially in accuracy.
---
Yea, I played my first playthrough with my brother the entire time. And when he wasn't on and it was just me and the game felt way lackluster
---
Have any idea what your luck is by chance?
---
Starched Genes is a must have perk to ensure you won‚Äôt loose desirable mutations (and don‚Äôt get new ones). 
---
Otherwise you will loose your mutation with RadAway or a decontamination shower.
---
Quite high. Maybe above 10
---
Are you on PS4? 
---
I run a bloodied heavy build. I kill most things before they can hit me but to be tanky i use the protocols. They reduce damage taken by 50% when you drop below 20% health
---
I am on PC. Emergency Protocol is a perk card, right?
---
ah you see I thought that but wasn't sure if they were in the game anymore. Evidently there are some still out there.
---
Tunnel Snakes: 10 members
---
Xbox: VaultTecTG
---
Discord: VaultTecTG#5591
---
Ah thanks matey thats awesome glad to here is :)
---
I have the gray and red alternating. It doesnt look as bad as it sounds.
---
That ok you can keep it but thank you :)
---
I have seen players with full weightless armor and the chameleon mutation that are completely invisible. No predator shimmer at all. This was on console,  so no cheat.
---
Fixers are the new meta after they were added to the legendary loot pool
---
-65 mins. Lol
---
Aah to bad i could have made them for you if on PS4. It's a torso mod for power armour
---
I bought two Tesla's yesterday. Anti-armor + limb damage the first one, furious + faster fire the second. 2200 caps total.
---
it was odd but it is possible its the object fired from bottlecap mines.
---
Very true
---
1) No, player vendors are usually around the 200 cap mark. The bunker is about 4K. 
---
2) If you don‚Äôt have starched genes 2 equipped you‚Äôll lose mutations in a decontamination arch. 
---
3) The recipes can be a decent investment but the recipes are about 18k from the bunker üëç
---
Monster Mash is a better Uranium Fever. 3-6 multistar legendary ghouls per run. Just camp the candy bucket.
---
Yeah, bloodied is always slightly better than Instigating, which is why I played bloodied...but Instigating is pretty close in PvE for 99% of enemies.
---
Ahhh.  A novelity animation item, legacy edition.
---
1. Buy serums from players, but don't pay any more than 300-400 for them. Buy recipes from the Enclave, though it's gonna be a while until you can afford them. Eventually you can sell them yourself and make a pretty penny.
---
2. Only if you don't have starched genes.
---
3. I'd still just buy the ones you want from players and use the recipes strictly for selling them to others, but of course you can make them for yourself as well.
---
Ah ok. You can really see how clueless I am even after level 90. I am very out of the loop with the meta. Is the plan for this PA torso mod sold by MODUS?
---
thank you so much!
---
thanks!
---
Heard some rumours about pineapple from some shady people in Flatwoods, something about "yummy" and "responder initiation" and "sauce for the ribeye steak". Is that anything you can confirm or deny? Low levels these days, wo-ha, let me tell you... anyways, would be good to know for research purposes...
---
No, emergency protocols is a mod for the chest piece - 50%dmg when below 20% health. Pair it with line wanderer for another - 20% dmg and you are very hard to kill
---
That mindset is exactly why overmonetization is so common in the industry these days, its why a game like this can exist, with more monetization than content. I will get spammed by shills but their downvotes are just admitting that what I am saying is true.
---
I really hope at some point they add clutter items. As nice as you can make your camp, without clutter Camps feel unlived in.
---
Havent tested yet but i get so many legendary weapons and armor that  the perveyor never have enough scrip. I dont even farm them.
---
Alright I get it. I do have the Lone Wanderer perk
---
Nothing new for the fools that fell for the subscription and are directly to blame for the issues with this game and so many others these days, they got exactly what they deserve.
---
I run a bloodied heavy gunner and I absolutely love it. You're better off with a 50 cal than a mini gun as well. Even just a 1* bloodied 50 cal will give you good dmg, but ffr or explosive is best. But they are very expensive
---
lol, sure ok, do you feel better now ?
---
You did mention. The thing is... With stealth boys disabled you'd be 100% certain he was invisible. The problem is, there's a lot of videos calling "invisible" at the beginning, then 4 minutes in you can see the skilled player's image whilst using stealth boy. They're usually full stealth gear, they,re just harder too see.
---
No worries!
---
Same thing happened to me.  Both workshops &amp; camps.  Seems to get triggered by an enemy in the camp.
---
If you "store" the offending turret and replace it, it will stop.
---
I will visit. Andreslamantis. Great job.
---
Do you have the "broken prosnap camera"? You have to have that to craft the camera. They are laying around everywhere and don't scrap like a regular camera.
---
The Greenbrior Ghost would be an interesting thing to do, screaming Jenny could be fun as well, basically more local legend stuff
---
Thank you :) You're welcome to swing by
---
Hehehe twat waffle
---
Well, I already understand that being in Pacifist mode doesn‚Äôt matter for workshops or being in teams. But the person I was responding to happens to be the 5th person I‚Äôve seen in as many days to claim that picking a world-container (not a door or extractor) in someone‚Äôs *camp* makes you go wanted. But I know for a fact that I‚Äôve picked dozens of non-workshop world-containers within the bounds of player camps (again, not talking about workshops) and never had any issues.
---
One player literally sent me a nasty-gram demanding that I move my camp so he could pick some locks. So, either I‚Äôm doing something special to prevent becoming wanted or multiple people are mistaken how the system works.
---
I‚Äôd just like to hear other people confirming what I think I know, or inform me as to what I‚Äôm doing that‚Äôs so special.
---
The tuxedos will probably return again on new year
---
I honestly forget crippling is even a thing since I'm basically wolverine
---
Also beware of taking RadX as it temporary suppresses your mutations, even with starched genes. Learned that the hard way in a nuked Whitesprings, was going to jump to the roof avoiding the golf club ghouls - "ha! bye bye su-" *SPLAT*
---
By ffr you mean furious?
---
This looks amazing. I'd like to add you to check it out, but I'm usually only on during the weekend. Is it safe to assume you won't be tearing this one down very soon?
---
This should be a link to my build
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f344e88&amp;d=s01sq2s20sx2s32sj2pe2e60eh2c72ic4s12ip2ir2s72a04l71ls2lt2&amp;w=&amp;m=c2fe3&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
Nope, ffr is faster fire rate
---
I do mean any containers in the world that have locks that a player then places their camp near. I've accidentally done it dozens of times with pacifist and it always gave me wanted status. The only reason I can think of it not happening to you is if when the player placed the camp the container didn't fully fall within the boundary, or you are the lucky "victim" of a bug.
---
No way it's going anywhere soon :) planning to convert it to a huge Christmas tree top if we'll get some special decorations
---
Spent 500 scrip and not a damn thing. I wish we could at least pick the first trait and have the second two be random.
---
Nice. I'll add you on PSN then and hopefully I get to see it soon.
---
Honestly, the ImposterSquatch as an easily killed crown sounds amazing to farm for Fixer plans and outifts.
---
I dont remember if you need a perk like armorer to craft PA parts/mods (the mod screen will tell you - there will be a 3rd column with the name and level of the perk you need), 
---
or 
---
you have the plan (and you have read it), but 
---
you may not have the required materials.
---
sadly no new stuff added :(
---
the emotes and outfits were the main reason for me to sub. ill wait one more week (like the green ranger outfit came 1 week later).
---
Wow thanks! A lot of great perks I ignored
---
Would definitely recommend some mutations then, with not really knowing what build your gonna go for I would just recommend the basic speed demon, marsupial, herbivore or carnivore, and adrenal reaction and then maybe if you want healing factor, just make sure to have starched genes and I would recommend class freak too
---
Just swing by whenever :) I'm on quite a bit
---
Ah I see, thanks!
---
So the raids still use the broken table? I guess that's an interesting trade-off then. Missing a lot of newer things, but includes the dragon. Wonder if they will eventually accidentally bring back the explosive energy weapon drop pool, considering they said they will "adjust" them and bring them back in like a year ago and we all know how much their promises mean nowadays
---
Forget a about bloodied. Get a Junkies .50 cal. Then get addicted to five different drugs. Get all the heavy gunner perks + bloody mess at max. You will do insane damage and be at full health
---
Is there any way to reduce the mutantions negative effects? I recall a perk card for it right?
---
Cool, see you soon :)
---
It's a feature
---
Right? I am absolutely LOVING all  these issues with FO 1st. Serves these morons right for encouraging shitty behavior that cause us all to get screwed time and time again but devs/publishers.
---
A good way to try and get it is actually by creating new characters and immediatley booking it to flatwoods to access the volunteer terminal and doing 'thirst things first' quest over and over. This ONE quest has a chance to drop the rare responder outfit, as well as other rare outfits that normally only drop from forest events. I have gotten the responder fireman helmet and forest camo jumpsuit doing this.
---
So i should avoid rad-X and just use the Decomm showers after I re-eq
---
I hope so, I can't wait to see those in Atom Shop. Did they release any dress/gown formal wear or was it just tuxedos?
---
I'm pretty sure the primary effect makes the weapon
---
No, I‚Äôd like for them to work on bugs and glitches, also content expansion before we come close to snow or anything else like that.
---
I‚Äôve seen them in vendors for 500-5000. It all depends on the seller.
---
do you just not complete it or how do I repeat it? thank you
---
Yeah, the only ones I'd really say are changeable are (r1-5 meaning their rank) 
---
S- r3 lock n load and r1 bear arms
---
P- r3 glo sights
---
E- r1 good doggy
---
I- r3 batters includes r5 gunsmith
---
A- r5 adrenaline
---
Good luck selling a Nocturnal handmade that isn‚Äôt Explosive
---
the green thumb bundle came back a couple times, I didn't want anything besides the dome, but the bundle wasn't much more than the lone item
---
I'm doing 1K for the assorted Jack o' Lanterns... that seems to be the going price. 
---
.
---
The Grim Reaper Cutout is around 5K
---
The event outfits, like the pirate attire or the David S. Pumpkins gear seems to be around 10K.
---
It was kind of nice. Need several hours to enable and takes some time to figure out the server is in non legendary mode. Public server hopping with a team would be way faster.
---
yep. waiting for it, too. this stuff is the main reason for my sub \^\^
---
I don't know really, I play dude characters. But the witch costume and civil war era dress are nice looking and found in game
---
I don‚Äôt think the people downvoting are morons, I just think they don‚Äôt agree with you
---
Thx!
---
I just scrip that stuff my man
---
Too bad. I‚Äôve sold Explosive nocturnal for an easy 3k
---
you missed the hype train \^\^
---
"guys stop paying more than i value something, the free market is wrong and you should only be spending your endless heaps of cash and gear at the rate I deem valid"
---
Parantly not
---
OMG üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Same at the asylum
---
*cries in golden handmade*
---
The greenhouse came back for a week like a week or two ago
---
I have no clue.
---
Yeah class freak reduces the negative effect by 75% at level 3 and be sure to have starched genes where you can‚Äôt lose mutations from using radaway
---
I actually started replacing a gary wall with red and saw them alternating, it does not look bad at all yeah
---
Thanks, will try it now.
---
im pretty sure the greenhouse dome came back like 2 or 3 weeks ago for a short time. but cant remember really.
---
"and are directly to blame for the issues" wait?! you made it clear. this game hadnt any issues since launch. ty for opening my eyes! lol
---
Do note that Rad-x diluted does not effect mutations, and Radshield is safe, too.
---
Now j can hear it. ü§£
---
I like the idea of paints being automatically removed when dropped or sold.  Another benefit is if the gear could be seen in trade menus.  I have had plenty of players initiating trade with me just out of curiosity of what legendary weapons I am carrying.
---
It isnt a matter of opinion, so "agreeing" has nothing to do with it. Buying a subscription for a game, released in such a state, by a developer/publisher who have done SO much shady shit, who monetize the game to unjustifiable degree, given the relative lack of content compared to past games in the franchise, is OBJECTIVELY contributing to the shitty patterns anyone with more than a single flickering brain cell can see in the video game industry right now. 
---
With all the mtxs and now this subscription, what do we have to show for it? Is the game that much better? Is it where it should be? Is NW the only sizeable content update we are going to see for a year, assuming WL is still on track for April/May of this year? Obviously throwing infinite dollars at Beth/Zeni isnt bringing much in the way of returns on investment, so yeah, continuing to throw money at them is objectively moronic behavior.
---
Harper's ferry and the burrows. nuke for extra fun
---
If you are mutated and starched genes (rank 2) is equipped your mutations are "permanent".  RadX will temporary negate them.
---
If starched genes is unequipped radaway might remove your mutations, unsure if the decon shower does this as well. 
---
Usure what chems are best in nuke zones.
---
Check the WS vendors for base price.  
---
  The other Mischief Night resort item drops - the guilded wall clock and resort signs - are 1200c each without price reduction perks applied.
---
Would not surprise me if the resort lights were similarly priced.
---
I have like 20 extra if you're on PC msg me. You need starched genes perk level 2 or it'll remove mutations
---
I dont think the dome has ever been included though has it? I havent seen it once since the original time.
---
I personally prefer it when nobody gets any legendary weapons or armor because someone killed the legendary enemy before they even became legendary /s
---
Yay more free wallpapers instead of icons!
---
I play on xbox so I'm not sure about pc. It should say once you fill the critical bar.
---
Yeah and throwing money at Beth/Zeni has resulted in SO MUCH NEW CONTENT, and NOW THE GAME HAS NO ISSUES. Fucking please!
---
If you find someone selling serums, ask if they'll craft some at a discount if you provide the materials. I do this at 75 caps vs. 350.
---
oops, missed it, thanks for the info though
---
I have 12 of them. 
---
It‚Äôs not letting me craft it or the film. I have all the needed ingredients plus tons.
---
It kind of reminds me of 20 years ago when i got permission to paint my old bedroom. Lol
---
Lvl 51 ~5,600
---
Does that get me an AAE pipe revolver?
---
Never unequip starched genes UNLESS you are intentionally resetting all if your mutations.
---
Totes amazing
---
I'm going back to GTAO for a day when they release snow....the view from Eclipse Penthouse...
---
thanks :)
---
Additional question, what does the star mean?
---
After a nuke dissipates. Since the game released it's been doing that
---
I have used stealth boy, i have seen players with stealth boy and i see them without problems, after searching an area many times suddenly he kills me and was 1m from me, other players joined the pvp with chamaleon effect and could see them without problems when they were near
---
You change the icon from the atom shop under your owned icons, the star means you are the team leader, the 1 means you are sharing a 1 Star perk card with your team
---
Ah right I thought I was going mad. Haven‚Äôt played properly in a while just been logging on to get the weekly free item. Only on now coz of the vender sale.....
---
Exit the anteroom, then come back in, it should be open
---
so how much NEW CONTENT we got before 1st? 2 questlines? lol
---
the game has the same issues it had when it launched. but who cares? oh you do! :D have a nice one..
---
So, just matters the armor weight or matters the agility score, the legendary increase in stealth effects, your stealth perks, or other armor effects. if all matters which armor effect is better for pvp?
---
Ugh.
---
ahhw darn it! i secretly really wanted to show my camp location off and have a meet and greet with my favorite  Fallout youtuber! 
---
heres some pics of my camp, the only one in appalachia with a functioning garage !  [https://imgur.com/a/lKwukDh](https://imgur.com/a/lKwukDh)
---
They are morons and any moron that has a subscription to this game
---
Thanks! Could any of these be the reason, that if me and teammate are doing a mission together, he cant get the mission items?
---
My wish list
---
Camo jumpsuit, Whitepoweder jumpsuit, Stimpact defuser plan.
---
It has to be his mission for him to claim them, mission items are not shared.
---
I want to fight an uncrippable, gigantic, dismembering deathclaw, as big as a queen. The type of deathclaw which was able to really fuck up up in Fallout 4.
---
Get in the habit of using diluted radx and radaway.  (The diluted versions do not supress your mutations.)
---
Unless you have lots of Luck points, you might want to acquire spare serums for whatever mutations you have.
---
  I only have 3 luck, which is used by Starched genes 2 and class freak 1.  I've swapped out for superduper3 for crafting, and forgot to switch back.  More than once.
---
Lost more than one mutation that way....
---
It is a mission for him. Maybe we are glitching.
---
It can also be full of protectrons
---
have my upvote! :D
---
I'm 28 or 29 with maybe 500 caps. Been with the game since beta but not a lot of time to play between work around the house and my normal day job.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=9111353&amp;d=sq2s32sr2a04lt2ip2&amp;w=&amp;m=cfe8&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
Those are all the necessary damage perks. 
---
I would suggest bear arms(strength) if you want to carry more than 1 heavy gun. If you want to be able to tank more, then look into getting the dodgy perk(agility). Scaly skin mutation and grounded are both good for more resistances.
---
If you still feel you need more tankiness then maybe get a suit of t51, it has higher Dr and Er.
---
Emergency protocols are really good, they boost my Dr over 500 and Er over 600 in t51. But you have to be 20% health for the effect, so you could be better off with medic torso or jetpack if you don't want to go bloodied. It would still be useful as a last second boost when your health gets low, as opposed to a constant boost by staying at 20% health. Power armor takes such a huge carry weight hit that I always run calibrated shocks on everything.
---
People are saying you should go bloodied, but if you want to be tankier you shouldn't. It will boost your resistances with perks and stuff but you have much less health and can die easy if you're not careful. Maybe look into a junkies gun, you would need 5 addictions but its 50% more damage.
---
 Either way you should be able to do decent damage with stock guns if your build is right, and you wanna get your build on the right track first so you can tweak and adapt to what kinds of weapons you find.
---
Main reason for mine are private worlds.
---
It is so nice to have workshops all to yourself, especially the ammo one.
---
And no hur dur griefers killing me with the radiation exploit while I craft things.
---
Having said that, if they want me to keep subbing - we better get cool new things as members.
---
Something on a weekly basis would be much appreciated and help the subscription succeed.
---
a all ammo and and appreciated are as basis be better cool craft dur especially exploit for get griefers have having help hur i if is it keep killing main me me members mine much new nice no on one private radiation reason said so something subbing subscription succeed that the the the they things things to to to want we weekly while with workshops worlds would yourself
---
The number and card is the level perk you have set to share to your teammates. You are currently sharing a level 1 perk.
---
You sure are passionate about how other people spend their money. If only you could control everything, then you could show everyone how smart you are.
---
Crashing has been a server issue since release
---
Amazing! Too bad I'm on PC. :(
---
Hm. Try dropping the ones you have and picking up another one?
---
Its much cheaper to buy from players. 
---
 If you dont have starched genes rank 2 equipped you will lose your mutations if you use radaway.   Havent tried losing a mutation via a shower but i assume it would also remove mutations.
---
 Also, rad x and radshield will nullify your mutations while they are active.
---
Yes you can purchase serum recipes but itll cost you quite a few caps.
---
Thank you! :) You can build it there too :) Earlier I described how to
---
I am passionate about not having every game ruined, rushed or over monetized because morons like bending over for devs/publishers and essentially asking for more greed and less content.
---
The greenhouse came back 2 times
---
If $8 is keeping you from trying it, you need to find another hobby...
---
I‚Äôve done that.   On Bethesda.net it claims 
---
‚ÄúYou may lose camera, avoid dropping/scrapping‚Äù
---
It doesn‚Äôt say anything about remaking one or not being able to make the film.
---
So stupid
---
2500 and people buy em
---
How about a "skin" that would change the smoke/fog machine into snow?  I didn't buy the Halloween/Mothman smoke machines, and I'd be hesitant about buying a machine that I'd delete in a month or two, but being able to re-skin the machine for different seasons?  I'd buy that in a heartbeat (fog w/ hearts for Valentines; green smoke for St Patrick's Day; red/white/blue smoke for Independence Day; etc)
---
wtf are you talking about, my whole point is that monetization hasnt fixed many issues and hasnt resulted in enough new content to jusitfy how much monetization there is, my point is that continuing to throw money at 76 isnt yielding any real tangible results, the amount of money Beth/Zeni have made from Atom store and 1st is not proportional to how much content or bugfixing we have had.
---
There's both a lockpicking and hacking challenge in the greenhouse which let you skip two rooms
---
You mean disconnects? Because crashing is your hardware issues
---
No matter how you word that it is still an opinion... Facts are generally backed up with hard data, not emotional responses. Not saying your valid opinion is wrong but it is still an opinion.
---
I have never used weightless,  so I actually don't know. I would surmise that weightless or chameleon are the best for stealth. Given that,  pvp typically degrades to a stealth boy and Tesla battle. The Tesla can find you no matter how stealthy you are.
---
Give us the next vault raid...
---
Not every player will have stealth percs/gear stacked though. And not every player will be the same visibility. I play a stealth build and a wanted player couldn't see me from a few metres back either
---
So very much this.  Just don't go into any pvp of any kind without expecting to die and you won't ever be disappointed.    
---
Personally I'm down for a scrap, and don't mind it if it's vs a team.  If I can give worse than I get, I consider that a win.  even if it's a team you get to start the engagement on your own terms and that  is a rather massive advantage if you properly leverage it.
---
a basement/fallout shelter for our CAMPS
---
Bulkhead door that leads to a loadable interior with a fixed area...2x2/3x3
---
separate budget - fully decoratable
---
There's no point in farming high level gear. The drop rate is extremely low. Best thing to get good gear is the purveyor (or trading communities) . Just collect every single legendary item you can get, no matter what lvl.
---
It triggers for me when I am using energy weapons and my oponets are using explosive gattling plasmas or lasers or teslas while they using stealthboys 
---
Just quit and come back in the game thats what I usually do, but definitely a glitch that Bethesda needs to fix.
---
gimme 3 more weeks so i can wrap up the secure challenge? &lt;3 (need meltdown for fuckin ants)
---
Dont give them god dam ideas, content like quests should be free as promised
---
Add back explosive energy weapons as a survival-like award.
---
I'd assume they wouldn't get rid of the current one, just have not be open
---
Think you'll have enough ants in 3 weeks? I've only got like 80 haha. Really want to see that fang emot though
---

---
Alright I see, thanks for the insight. I've learnt more on this post than during my entire play
---
It was still in the game as of Saturday last week. I know because one of my friends got it.
---
If a large enough player base chooses to opt into a service isn't it more reasonable to consider that the group opting in is the game designers primary target? If that holds true aren't they making the games for that group in the first place? From that perspective the game isn't ruined, it's working as intended for the group it was meant for. You just seem mad games aren't made for people like you, so you make it seem like people who don't agree with you are less intelligent. People can have opinions and pay for what they want. That's called real life üòÇ
---
A bullshit premise. I dont have access to Zeni's financials bc they are not an publicly traded, however anyone with more than a single flickering brain cell can see that the amount of monetization this game has is not proportional to the amount of issue resolution, stabilizing or content updates we have seen. Also it is known FACT that the reason so many games are rushed out, have tons of issues, have no content, overmonetize is because people kept financially supporting companies who did this stuff. People buying MTXs is why every game has them, people preordering from companies known to rush games are why so many games get rushed or release unfinished. These are facts no matter how you try to spin it. If you can refute these facts by all means, but you just saying "hard data" as if thats enough to refute what I am saying is disingenuous.

Ive seen Protectrons as well as Eyebots too.

How about finally giving us the final two stars on any legendary item.. scorchkillers receiver does not count as it‚Äôs pretty Garbo IMO
---
I like to adventure solo, but completing meltdown requires teamwork and communication such that if you are able to find a full team to run it with, it's the most rewarding experience in the game. The timer is rough, but if you do residential last, and you run, you can get to the geck with 9 minutes. Trying with 2 people will break you.
---
If they didn't break in 5 minutes ( or less, seriously ) ....
---
you clearly didnt tested both weapons then. the charging thing is a gimmick but it is functional just like the weapon itself. the gauss fire **just as fast with fully charged shots** as the lever action which takes around 1 sec per shot.. My BE gauss hits for 1460 raw without any buffs like chems or bobbleheads while the BE lever with the same circumstances hits for 700...using both side by side switching them for comparison is not even a fair match...gauss can hit the queen for 8k+ per shot under the right circuncircumstances
---
Still curious about those last two stars myself....
---
This is the correct answer, level 1 or level 50..they all turn to scrip
---
Right I thought they would be mods dropped from the raids but .. I was so very wrong XD
---
Thank you!!!!!

So mysterious.

Especially considering that it's now been a full month since Fallout First is out and people are having to decide to renew or not. Now is the time they should be working extra hard to get everyone to keep their subs. Instead they've had three weeks with nothing new for subscribers and no sign of the "exclusive discounts in the Atomic Shop" that they promised we'd get.

It's a 30% chance for 1-star, 10% for 2-star, and 5% for 3-star.

The TL;DR is vault tec left a single engineer to act as shadow overseer of the community which was being led by a pastor. They had a geck, sand hence the ability to feed the wasteland, and decided to send out envoys offering food. The free states sent a 3 man team which though the offer of free food was a trap, executed everybody, then went to the geck room to destroy it under the false pretense that it was a brainwashing device. This caused a chain reaction which mutated the fauna and flora in the Mire.

im at 530, i found a spot in meltdown where you can solo farm 20-30/hr

I don‚Äôt have a sub yet, but what are the 1st atomic shop options?

Patrolling the hills of Appalachia sometimes makes you wish for a Nuclear Winter.

I've use Chameleon &amp; weightless. If you stack all the stealth percs plus get stealth weightless/ Chameleon you are near to, or 100% invisible in most cases, the only things that can see you is Assautrons or very high perception VATS players
---
Don't worry it's just work.
---
I tested plenty.  I don‚Äôt remember the exact numbers, but rapid firing the BE Gauss was I believe in the 500-800 range.  Firing the BE lever the same way is 2K+.  I was able to hit numbers slightly higher with the Gauss when fully charging, but that is much slower and clunky than firing a lever.  Not to mention the weight of Gauss ammo vs .45 etc.  I traded to get the highest damage Gauss in the game for a pure Energy damage rifleman build, and I was seriously disappointed. I had a BE Laser Rifle and B25 Tesla, and I never wanted to use the Gauss.  The Laser Rifle (like the lever) outclassed the Gauss in every way.   I ended up duping the Gauss and moving over BE and B25 fixers instead of the Gauss, and my character became much stronger. 
---
If you are the type of player who wants to play a slow stealth sniper, charging every shot...then the Gauss is great.  I like to take out enemies quickly, and in one shot...the Gauss isn‚Äôt for me.
---
Damn son. You'll have to post a pic of the emot once you get it
---
No thanks. I don‚Äôt want actual content behind a paywall.
---
TO be fair, we did get an exclusive discount. On the riot paint.
---
Then, like a day later, after a lot of people complained... It was made free. And said it was a free item for Fallout 1st members... Lol. Damage control, but I will take free.
---
Don't think that was a mistake on their end. All the price mistakes they have are usually fixed in and hour or less.

the second shot does 25% of the first shot

Just to add a quick comment: I would recommend that you buy the recipes for the serums you want, unless you keep the Starched Genes lvl 2 card equipped all the time.  As someone who swaps cards in and out as needed, I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I lost my mutations because I forgot to re-equip Starched Genes.  Just keep in mind serums require Stable Flux, and the ingredients for Stable Flux are found in nuked areas. 
---
The recipes are expensive (23k caps normal price if I remember correctly), but with good Charisma boosts (Hard Bargain lvl 3 perk card, Charisma bobblehead, Grape Mentats), you should be able to get it for about 18k caps. 
---
And the serums are a good source of caps when you craft extras; they sell for about 400-500 caps at the bot vendors.
---
Had hoped to see the Free States bundle back always next week....
---
Their was a post, I'll have to hunt for it if you want. That had data on player base, amount of players using 1st, and growth. Ironically (or not) one had to have a subscription to see the raw data but it showed that almost half the player base had subscriptions, and that the amount that left was pretty negligible. 
---
Games released in the rough is sadly part of the norm because any company has to answer to the stakeholders and all they care about it cash. 
---
However your approach using profanity and insults kind of takes away from your point and makes people automatically resistant to whatever message you want to get across. You are angry and aggressive to strangers on the internet is all most will get out of your comments.
---
In this case i searched the whole area well for some minutes and no chamaleon effect around, while a new player joined with chamaleon and could see him clearly not even near. And it was not just once, it was always i couldnt see him
---
we should be rewarded for every 50 lvls of play. something to keep us grinding away.
---
Maybe a special perk card with 2 attributes from the same category but only counts as one perk point.
---
Nice one!
---
Thinking of taking the beam splitter off..
---
So half the current effects are less than worthless and dont even entirely work but you want more of them?  Also, why?  We dont even need the 3 stars we currently have.  People already solo the queen on the regular.
---
This is beautiful
---
cool idea! Or let a player completely rearrange their specials every 50 levels
---
What DLC in 76 have you paid for?
---
I would like to see snow and a Legendary Robot Santa Claus like in Futurama
---
someone uploaded a video already, gimme a sec to edit and il link it
---
Hard.  Mode.
---
√∑50 levels to every creature and 5% higher legendary spawn chance.  We can farm anywhere on the map then for end game weapons and armor since minimum mob level would be 51.
---
That'd be sweet
---
your more then welcome to buddy !
---
I really like this idea.  I wish there was an expert or veteran mode that made the entire map high level spawns.  New Gad and Charleston would be so awesome as a high level battleground.
---
New server maybe, I'll try hopping servers to see if it is consistent.
---
Clearly I was talking about games that use DLC rather than MTX. 
---
Does your question have a point?
---
üò≠
---
If you've already cleaned all of them out from your inventory/stash and tried to make a new one, that's about all of the troubleshooting suggestions I've got - short of deleting your profile tag or clearing the cache, if you're on XB1 which solves some issues I occasionally have. 
---
I'd get rid of all 12 of the cameras you've got from your stash, delete your profile tag/clear the cache/temp files, log out of the game and wait for a few minutes, and log back in.
---
Maybe someone else on whatever format you're in could offer something additional. Good luck, I hope you get your camera back.
---
They could make spooky mist for Mischief Night, wonder if it's that easy to put in some snow as well?
---
shower makes you loose mutations
---
Thanks good to know

I‚Äôll try to remember to add both of y‚Äôall when I log on tonight ~ 8pm CST.

---
Well with bungie and destiny 2, you wont have access to certain new things, like the new raid and certain missions, unless you buy the new DLC and season pass, right?
---
I'd rather they keep this current form of subscription, where some have acceess to more storage, private servers etc..,  but everyone have access to the same full game.
---
You get an upvote for putting MORE in there.

God I hate parents that let their 8+ year olds play this game.

*Is it enough to have you subscribe? Doesn‚Äôt sound like you do, so then no that‚Äôs not enough than.*
---
*But no if the scrap box went to all, then subscribers have no reason to stay. I have many friends that play and subscribe but private servers are hardly used. It‚Äôs incredibly boring in a private server.*

*2.46 million copies were sold as of February 2019, there is less than 10% of the players on this sub. Less than that are complaining about the 1st subscriptions.*
---
*So 2.46 bought*

*1mil don‚Äôt care (casual on off gamers)*

*500k hate 1st*
---
*500k subscribe*
---
*460k stopped playing*

*But take that and give it an incredibly low number that subscribe.. maybe it 500,000 and they are paying 14.99, why are they going to fuck up making 7.5 million a month because of the other half that hate the subscription? They have sold more games than that since February. Even the ones that don‚Äôt like it have subbed just to fill the scrap box.. I don‚Äôt see it going away, sorry dude*

You can look into that if you want some data and I hope you find a way to lessen your anger at stranger!

These Atom Shop update posts keep prompting me to log in to imgur to verify my age. I don't get this prompt from any other imgur links. Is it something to do with the OP?
---
Thanks ;)
---
No ,they are just shit...dont know why ppl even use em
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and I have no idea what it means to delete my profile tag etc. I‚Äôm sure making a new char would fix my issue but as a fresh lvl 100 I really don‚Äôt want to do that.
---
You complete the quest all the way to the point where you have to acess the terminal again and get the rewards. If you dont get any outfits then just delete the character and try again.
---
Theres nothing black friday priced on that page lmao

"Black friday deals!" Still spend $7+

**Bug**: two nuke announcements and two nukes dropped on prime (I saw both warheads coming in, resulting in double mushroom clouds), yet only one nuke launched.  [https://imgur.com/a/yQKi4Yv](https://imgur.com/a/yQKi4Yv)

Melee build but slowly converting to heavy weapons
---
It's kind of depressing how easy this would be to implement vs how unlikely it is we will get it.
---
It hasnt done that to me for awhile, but its gotten me close to killed a couple of times, use to do it all the time Also the emotes and weapons seems to switch places every so often lol. Get the bug yet where you emote and keep emoting till you draw your gun lol?
---
Yeah, I'm having this too... I guess it's safe to say both wheels are pretty much broken at this point
---
If you are buying serums then buy from player vendors.  They are typically 250 to 300 caps.  
---
The recipes are about 18,000 caps with a decent high Charisma level.  The nice thing about the recipes is that the serums sell to the robot vendors for up to 500 caps.   So easy cap limit once you know  how to make them. 
---
You can also take a radiation bath or drink glowing goo to get random mutations.  Radaway can remove them. I got Marsupial early on this way. 
---
Of course, you could also make friends with a high level and they might give you a few serums.
---
I think your best bet is to keep trying to milk it.
---
That way at least one of you gets to enjoy himself.
---
I bet the players are gobbling up this outfit.
---
75% of the map seems to just disappear after level 50.  I want it back.  I suppose we can keep a stash of low level gear to run the low level areas and event. I usually just put my weapons away and bare fist fight everything.  This is one of my favorite suggestions if not my favorite.
---
Yeah i hope they fix it. Sorry you keep getting downvoted, just assholes not wanting to acknowledge their game is broken or the anti fallout people atm. Ignorance is bliss i guess üòÇ
---
In game, it's perpetually October 20something. No December, no Xmas, no white Xmas. :(
---
I get you, it hits so much harder with it though... !
---
I never see the shimmer so everyone is 100% invisible for me. Maybe my brightness is too low or too high. Either way, Quad Tesla solves that issue.
---
You have a sad life huh?
---
I did this a bit this past weekend and it wasn‚Äôt very fun spending 30 minute chunks just farming ants. At least you can get a lot of acid at the same time. 
---
I‚Äôm at around 450 and I guess I‚Äôm not looking forward to ~20 hours of grinding to get the emote.
---
its what i did this weekend as well, i agree that is not pleasent, but my ocd will not let me leave this 1 raid challenge incomplete when i have all the others done.
---
and tbh i kinda wanna flex with it on some of my NW buddies
---
Considering how much "Coal" Mumbles gives me I think Miners outfit and Pickaxe is in order.
---
I get where you're coming from, but in context this suggestion would probably not go down well. You're basically asking them to gate content behind the cash shop, as opposed to just cosmetics. Yea I know it would just be a little quest, but regardless, it would still amount to cash shopping content, and that would piss a lot of people off and stir up another PR shitstorm for Bethesda. :/ 
---
Creation Club can get away with this strategy because the offerings there are made by paid modders and the game itself isn't controversial like 76.
---
Yeah, I'm not even bashing it either, I play it every day lol. Just reporting a prolonged bug is all. All good my dude, thanks for commenting!
---
How about a krampus outfit?
---
Lol that works.
---
Yeah, I'd say metal bolstering armor would be premium.
---
...for low health, of course.  Metal Vanguard if you swing the other way.
---
How about a two pronged approach-
---
1. Add more royalty free music to the game - Bethesda we're asking you to go and license more music, there is plenty of royalty free music out there
---
2. Add the ability to modify the playlist for each C.A.M.P Jukebox by attaching it to a terminal - it'd just have a list of all the songs, with a checkmark next to each, uncheck songs to remove them from the playlist of that Jukebox.
---
This is pretty neat!
---
I can't wait for that bit of inspiration for my build. I'll keep grinding for junk and stockpile plenty, thank you scrap box XD
---
Yeah, I get back by the forest, ash heap, etc chain running events.  If it's a low level zone I kill a Supermutant or Scorched and use their gun or melee.  Basically get myself a random level appropriate weapon for the zone I'm in and just throw it away after.  Still overpowered for the zone but it's not as bad when you're 2 shotting things instead of 1 shotting them.  Also, chainsaws exist have several mods including a flamer attachment, and are only level 20.  Just sayin.
---
Yeah same here. I also give away free non Max level legendary weapons and armor to folks in need.
---
Thank you very much. 
---
Here, have a squirrel on a stick and an upvote ofcourse.
---
Maybe try their Twitter?
---
I don‚Äôt have this problem at all. Sounds to me like user error.
---
How can it be user error lol
---
yeah, that whole "your favorite things are either going to be tied into a bundle or only be in the shop in inconvenient times" does get old. like I really want that damn raider throne they had forever ago. I'd never played fo4 nuka-world and worked with the raiders until playing 76. changed my f*cking life. now I seriously regret not getting it when I had the chance
---
I'll try the forceful stock.  Thanks
---
How about trying to find the tourist again and sort of start the quest over fresh? 
---
Running out of ideas, especially since I don't know enough about the PS4 to help you. Approaching it like a typical computer though, clearing out the cache on your PS4 and trying to force your PS4 and Bethesda's servers to resync your character info might be worth a shot. 
---
I definitely wouldn't want to lose a lvl 100 character, either.

No.i would like to see the game fixed.i would like to see wastelanders and raiders and BoS and enclave npc's.

More real quests.not dumbass events.so fkng boring.

Im playing earlier fallouts intead of this dumpster of a game.

I have an AAE Gatling laser and AAE Gatling Plasma abs Quad auto Tesla sitting in my stash.  Why?  At some point I can use them as collateral for a trade as those weapons aren‚Äôt my cup of tea. 
---
Something is worth what someone is willing to pay.   To each their own.
---
I have to disagree idk which type of lever action and gauss you tested but they are seriously not even in the same category.  As mentioned other 3 times the fire rate from both weapons is the same so idk how you were firing faster with the lever. The gauss has the OPTION to tap fire for less dmg and higher rate of fire atleast something that the lever does not. The difference in dmg per shot between both weapons is huge with the BE versions of both weapons being twice as much dmg for the gauss.
---
I get it that the gauss may look big and clunky but speaking of performance only there's absolutely no reason why the lever would outperform the gauss in any way. Same fire rate, same magazine size, same ap usage way less dmg.
---
You either didnt tested both guns with the same exact legendary effects or level or something like that to compare the dmg of both or even worse comparing a gauss to a semi auto explosive laser lol. I own both in 2* BE max level versions i can take pictures of the dmg difference if you want
---
The lever is in the same category as the hunting...the lever is better than the hunting but nowere close to the performance of the gauss
---
For me Black Friday saving would match other games like World of Warships with their 50% off yearly Premium account.  Russians know how to get our dollars.

---
Does the shadow prime armor still make all the sounds?

You can manually set these to track or not. I‚Äôve got a whole list of crap I turned off tracking for cause I can‚Äôt be bothered.
---
Thank you! Inspiration is everywhere :) It'll struck one day
---
You will generally get the non essential rewards.( xp, currency, and some aid.) I have ran my friends through the same things and no big rewards
---
I look forward to it, the grind is real though
---
I use VATS all the time, but am now wondering if I‚Äôm working the critical hits as intended. Can anyone on PS4 confirm which button fires the critical hit?thanks!
---
Ah, that‚Äôs were my confusion came from. I haven‚Äôt worn power armor since April I think is a crazier takeaway from this. Thank you!
---
Anyways in pvp there should be a red icon above the player, and this player didnt have one
---
Here‚Äôs a reliable place to farm docile animals :
---
You know that radio tower near the horizon‚Äôs rest plane, south of the Monongah power plant?
---
Follow the actual road down. 
---
When you see a Jeep crashed into a tree by the road that leads to the tower, literally at that Jeep is where animals spawn. 
---
I had a camp there. Server hop. You‚Äôll find rabbits, cats, opossums, deer..it‚Äôs a good place. Peaceful. Quiet. 
---
Plus The Whitespring is just over the mountain.
---
You can get set of outfit and 2 emotes+ scrap box
---
üòÇ üëç ok then i see you know your stuff pretty well you definitely seem to have tested this alot and surely you can read when i had to explain 3 times that THEY BOTH HAVE THE SAME STATS (FIRE RATE,MAGAZINE SIZE, BUT THE GAUSS DOES FUCKING TWICE THE DMG)
---
at this point you either being willingly ignorant or just trolling lmao
---
Yes, but need to at least shoot in the right direction with tesla i think
---
There is probably already an unfinished version of the vault in the files. The interiors of all three raid vaults actually existed in a WIP state as early as a year ago. So, the mission could have been enabled by accident, or due to a rare glitch.
---
Lvl 38 and play only on weekends. I saved almost no cap since I always fast travel, but now things are different. I get a shit ton of cloth and craft all the possible civil era hat to sell at train station. Had less than 200 caps when I started it and now I'm getting some cool money.
---
It just wants to return the favor.
---
Just get Enforcer and carry a shotgun to pelt the scorchbeasts with. It‚Äôll make them land and you can manually thump them to death after.
---
You mean tracking as active so it shows on the map? What I mean is that I start X event. I can see it in my pip-boy and finish it. Then, instead of going in the finished list (below all events and greyed out) it just disappears
---
Yeah and actually give good weapons etc.
---
lol this.
---
this is awsome!!! love it!
---
There was a coffin one at Halloween, but more skins would be nice.
---
no . its anything with high fire rate damage and multiple pelets. aka gat plasmas etc. if you pair them with the strang pa you shit on people
---
This bug is caused by an explosive energy weapon in conjunction with Bloody Mess. When the weapon "breaks" your body due to Bloody Mess, you become invulnerable. After you become invulnerable, you are exploiting. Though it's not your fault, wilfully continuing to use it is an exploit that you can be banned for.
---
Someone with Godmode on can still be killed, it's just harder and requires specific items.
---
Add to list:  Turrets still magically disappear from CAMP.  Happened to me yesterday, now I've lost that build space and can only build one- so right now I have zero, because where I had the two placed were ideal.  Now my abode is defenseless!  Anyone know of a fix?  (With the exception of telling me to move my camp.)
---
The Country club at the Whitesprings has always been a great source for Legendaries.  Do it over and over and over and you will make out with a few weapons and armor, and enough diluted rad away to keep you in business.  If you want a tip, head straight in and down the stairs and into the pro shop.  Go behind the till, and you will have a better chance at keeping the ghouls on one side of you, instead of having them swarm you from all sides.   Also, in case you didn't know, the nearby water fountain inside the stone gazebo will cure you of your disease.  With each sip, you will be cured of one disease.  Repeatable immediately.
---
Well I never knew this! Thanks for the tip man!
---
I've had this happen to where the only way to reclaim build space is to periodically store the upper level of your house and then the turrets reappear in the stored portion of the base. Sometimes literally I have to deconstruct my entire base to see objects because they're in the base but, not visible to the player.
---
Originally they said that they would work in PA, but then they changed their mind. They are such a pia to get that they really should work in PA imho.
---
These are some seriously good ideas, great job.
---
Bloodied Explosive.
---
Oh god no, public servers couldn't handle it, i cant even be on as it is right now with out crashing cant imagine if they added that to the mix, other than that yes would be cool
---
Bloodied by a long shot.
---
for me..  TSE because I like to run full health..
---
my real preference and what i actualy use is Furious...
---
If only I could upvote this into the atmosphere. Need. More. Clutter.
---
With a melee build (high strength) the excavator armor with calibrated shocks gives me over 600 lbs of carry!  This also entails using a bloodied build and the associated perks.
---
No they wouldn‚Äôt
---
That's would be so cool bro lol
---
It's cause you didnt have a carrot in your inventory.
---
IMHO, and for the armor I have now - PA by far.
---
When I am not in PA, I have DR 71 non legendary deep pocketed combat armor chest piece.
---
Arm and Leg armor is various 2\* legendary with materials weight reduction, then modded for deep pockets.  One is chameleon, one is zealots, one is mutant, I forget the 4th.
---
Best I can out of them individually is 40.  Works on the west side of the map and part of the divide, but not in the east.
---
Have you read this sub after Bethesda does anything at all?
---
Fires more quickly? Lmfao you definitely dont have the intelligence stats to do any sort of weapon reviews xD  LEARN HOW TO FUCKING READ jfc...you clearly just showing you didnt tested the guns since they both have the same FUCKING FIRE RATE (for the 4th time explaining it to you)
---
"Doesn't hit much harder than the lever" üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ 
---
Conclusion...you either got a magical lever rifle that doesn't exist and that fires quicker than the gauss and have similar dmg or you just straight up retarded to be willingly ignorant to the point of not really understanding how both guns perform in comparison to eachother..the 2nd one seems way more likely tho given the fact that you dont seem to know how to read and interpret. I wish reddit allowed me to explain to you using crayons.

I can save that BE90 from you if you want üòÇ i already own one of those too but i can find a better home for it, just tell me what would you want
---
Let‚Äôs just make FO1st even more BS
---
Never gotten one and I try every time on all the Fallouts that have had it. Congrats.
---
I had some kid try to guilt me into selling him a gatling plasma because he spent real money on his caps and only had so many left lol.
---
Ya I‚Äôm only like 50lbs overweight in my x-01, I‚Äôve taken to collecting more fluxes lately and just noticed.
---
Agreed
---
Welcome to the Wasteland.
---
Go for 2* more change for the tse u want,but really just sell stuff in your vendor and sell out the station vendor everyday.once u hit 15k plus then buy one from r market.goodluck!
---
It definitely monetizes itself like an MMO
---
Are you an American living in Russia or are you a native? And if so your English is quite good.
---
Downvoted for stating an opinion
---
Oh man, they're pretty rare, good luck
---
Nothing new?  Did you not get your 1650 Atoms at renewal just recently?  Did you not get the Riot armor paint a couple of weeks ago?  I'd look for new Fallout 1st stuff probably next week which will be December.
---
Xbox?
---
I‚Äôd wait a bit, Wastelanders will hopefully give this game a much need makeover
---
Actually mod unlocks are random. If you happen to get the drum mag before the stinging you were lucky.
---
I‚Äôll give u one for free if ur xbox. Got spares on my main char
---
Sorry I guess this isn't the Top Gear sub.
---
And our government.
---
PC
---
No Ps4 unfortunately
---
I'm thinking Ebeneezer Scrooge may be a better fit.
---
Yes. I want this.
---
i've got loads on ps4 if you need one
---
Ukraine but I think they moved their teams west after the invasion
---
Add me, I can help you get it back and keep it.  Meidara007
---
I got ya bud PSN is Dwist
---
I think it's WAY more important to decide on a cool costume.  have you seen the opossum hat in the atom store?
---
Buy that first, then worry about perks.
---
TSE if you're not a bloodied character... Not sure why that needs to be mentioned but evidently it does
---
They sell quicker at 100, and when I was still trying to get the last one I was selling them at 100 just to get rid of them because I had so many duplicates and I didn't want to crowd my machine with them.
---
Opossum hat.
---
Ah well so much for that theory.
---
Omg yes send me ur screen name pls I‚Äôll add u
---
&gt; this guy 
---
Gal. Which kinda throws a wrench in things.
---
Maybe Grahm as Santa, Chally as a reindeer and Murmrgh as an elf.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.

pm me and we can set it up :)

I personally believe the backpacks were introduced as a way to counter calibrated shocks on PA. They have siad multiple times they do t want only one viable build option, and calibrated shocks made PA the most logical choice to use. But with the high capacity mod, you are at the same added weight as calibrated shocks. Therefore making a non PA build be able to compete for end game looting.
---
If you apply a mule build as well, all the weight reduction perks with only appropriate mutations, its insane how much you can carry, nearly 12,000 weight pre-perk reduction down to 1,600, I'm not sure the complete max because I haven't hit it yet on that character. And while excavator can significantly boost weight, full unyielding at low health and high rads, with weapon weight reduction or ammo reduction, or food/chem reduction plus deep pockets is bananas.
---
Only after Bethesda makes a mistake or adds in something horrible, which is really often.
---
Added as friend
---
You know? I can get behind that
---
Would be good, but Scrooge never liked giving
---
Great logging in now
---
That‚Äôs so bizarre. I‚Äôll have to figure out what I‚Äôm doing differently, then. I just double checked some recent footage I recorded where I‚Äôm literally picking the lock of a level 3 safe in the center of a player‚Äôs camp (it was located in the buried rail cars underneath a power line tower in the Mire).
---
Especially since my Anti-Armor non-Explosive Gatling Plasma already chews through mobs and players alike. The explosive effect is nice, but it's not worth what people are charging.
---
Knowing Bethesda, They'll have it as an exclusive Private server option for Fallout 1st. Cause anything we say on this Reddit, Tom Howard just looks &amp; thinks yup Fallout 1st.
---
I just recieved my yesterday.
---
I mean an commendation for 25k aint that bad of a price üòÇüòÇüòÇüêë
---
Wow i wasn't expecting that i thought the guy was just gouging :O Works for me though!
---
I prefer west tel if you can handle all the mutants. Good source of gunpowder, plastic, and steel if done correctly.
---
That sucks so you would have to make a new character grind it to level 50 and then do the desired quest to get said item?
---
I had problems with the wallpaper. I put it on one wall and it removed all my mounted heads to storage. I try to place my mouunted heads and i get the error "intersects existing object". I remove wallpaper and mounts place fine.
---
if you don‚Äôt want it i sure do.
---
Haha, I'd bet you can get some serious caps out of it. There's one serious collector's out there.
---
Any idea on the Pumpkin stands, the empty, half and full ones?
---
Screenshot?
---
The question was rhetorical, you say it‚Äôs as much as a DLC. We have no paid DLCs so your comment has no value in regards to 76, doesn‚Äôt matter what other games cost. 1800 atoms for something like that is fine with me and something I‚Äôd purchase.
---
Wow yeah looks like i'll be listing mine to match - glad i didn't just shove them on at a low rate
---
Had 2 extra figured u can have one for yourself now. Enjoy!
---
It depends on the MMO. This game doesn't have a required sub, the sub itself is basically a bonus for buying atoms, and there are no plans for paid expansions.
---
Any of that might change, but right now (as much as I don't like the aggressive monetization at all) I think there are some key differences.
---
Same here, subscribed on the 21st and got nothing for the year. Sent off a ticket and got a canned response. Not really good enough.
---
Yea if your month runs out,you still have access to the scrap box.but you can't put anymore stuff in there. Only take out scrap.
---
So it‚Äôs likely a new Pay to win or ‚ÄúConvenience item‚Äù similar, but different, to the fridge
---
Thanks! Does the WS bot vendors just have the resort item drops?
---
Then if they're going for 1,200 on the vendors are people reselling for 1k or so?
---
&gt;I wonder what it would be like if duping never happened.
---
a lot less people doing sbq vault 94 project paradise and impostor sheepsquatch thats for sure
---
Ty so much
---
This is honestly likely
---
They don't actually lose though. That's the issue. That's ALWAYS been the issue with this game. That's why it needs to have a net negative cap sink.
---
Sell it for max caps
---
Brainwashed lol, In all seriousness that‚Äôs a decent deal and I may consider it if there are no other *good* games I can get for cheap. I like the idea of a fallout mmo as I play ESO and subscribe to it. So both worlds would be great.
---
Regular radaway does not suppress mutations just regular rad-x does. And as others have mentioned rad shield is also safe. If you need to cure rads and don‚Äôt have starched genes, nuka grape and Brahman milk both cure rads without getting rid of mutations.
---
I would pay a couple thosand caps for something like that. Caps can always be generated. But these items may only happen a couple hundred times in a games lifetime.
---
I don‚Äôt really play MMOs, so I guess I wouldn‚Äôt really know
---
There are many types of radiation. Heat is generated during nuclear reaction such as fission and fusion any remaining radioactive material gives off charged particles not heat as you would describe. Try to think of it more like light if you could see it it would glow. This is the simplest way to explain as I understand.
---
even if you are not a bloodied character, the bloodied is the better option. 
---
TSE is at most +25% from the second shot.
---
Bloodied hits that at 80% health.  Most people are not full health 100% of the time, as soon as combat starts, you will take damage, pushing the bloodied above the TS in damage.
---
They'll probably make it a nuclear winter reward. For obvious reasons.
---
Yes but it is rare.  This has happened since the game launch I think.  Alternatively they spawn robots.  Also rare.
---
TSE for safety, especially in SBQ fights. Suddenly your AP is trained and you‚Äôre surrounded by scorched, you say bye bye to your fluxes. The only folks who don‚Äôt like TSE are vats users.
---
Ive seen them in vending machines from 250 to 1k.
---
Yes.
---
I'm new to the game,  I was going to put wallpaper in my base but it seemed like it was saying it would remove the wall, will it?
---
Leader of the pack event.  At least 3 each time.
---
UGH!  If you could see my camps 2nd and 3rd floor right now, you would understand why I would hesitate doing this.  Oh well.  Either two things are going to happen, I'll just leave it alone, or my OCD is going to take over again and try to fix this.  I'm going to tell myself repeatedly to just leave it alone - although that's probably futile.  This sucks.
---
i have a 1080ti but i think most of my smoothness is probably cpu side
---
even for non bloodied builds, bloodied is better, it will start to outperform the TSE as soon as you start taking damage.
---
I‚Äôm at the point I‚Äôm setting stuff to ridiculous prices just to see if they will sell.
---
...most don‚Äôt but then someone drops 10k caps on a 1 Star bolstering wooden leg and I wonder
---
The wendigo colossus looks like the right fit for fallout and the floaters are also confirmed to be in the in the update so that‚Äôs a good start. 
---
Also, bit off topic but I want to see the scorched or feral ghouls in power armour. Like a faction of armoured scorched or ghouls head to  toe in armour and heavy weapons.
---
I put a ton of vault boy 2000 plushies all over my camp, in the punch bowl, in the porta potty, on the crafting workbenches, on my instruments, on the Mr. Fuzzy ride, on the mounted heads, and then I placed a vault boy 2000 cutout surrounded by lots of plushies as a symbol of worship. My camp looks like it‚Äôs run by them and it definitely seems much more lively than it did before I came up with the idea
---
The Empty one was never available.
---
on xbox one, i logged into my microsoft account to check and manage subscriptions.  it showed fo1st needed to renew even though it was set to auto renew, it didnt. 
---
i manually renewed and got my atoms.   this was yesterday the 25th.
---
Only the things attached to the wall.  Goes into storage.
---
Kind of crazy, really.   Black Shovel is probably the best "generic" backpack option they have.
---
I'm not getting that prompt on mobile or on PC? Weird.
---
If it makes you feel any better legendary loot has been kinda low lately ime. Havnt had a game crash because of a nuke in quite some time. I also am on Xbox and light off nukes 4-5 times a week. Am on wireless, and have a somewhat old Xbox one. 
---
I do experience crashes occasionally, just not from nuke zones.
---
"We have no paid DLCs so your comment has no value in regards to 76, doesn‚Äôt matter what other games cost."
---
Really? You don't pay attention to price trends between products when you buy something? 
---
Man, you're like a corporation's wet dream.
---
That silliness aside, Bethesda has monetized both FO4 and Skyrim with DLC, their two most popular and successful games. There is a clear trend in pricing for these things, and many people have pointed out the unreasonable differences between FO4's DLC and Creation Club sales. It's basically common sense to look at this stuff before you blindly purchase, I'm really not sure why you wouldn't. Too much disposable income maybe?
---
At the end of the day, if 1800 is reasonable to you, great, it's your money to do with as you like. You can pay $500 for a PA skin if you want, I don't care at all. But when you're promoting an $18 price point for such a small thing in a video game, in a way that could affect the entire community's money (if it was made a standard price), you better bring an actual argument to the table instead of just 'oh it's fine with me'. xD
---
I didn‚Äôt know anything about a damn sale!!! Would of been nice for a little news in advamce!
---
This sounds right because when I farm the two fissures in the bog I always find at least 1 legendary
---
Fried ghouls? That can be an added recipe item!
---
I recommend not considering the Atomic Shop as canon. There is no lore supporting its existence.
---
Honestly, people sell stuff at prices acting like the duping mess didn‚Äôt happen a while back, sure a lot of weapons were wiped but so many of the same guns were put into circulation nothing is worth more than 10k
---
IDK.  I used the the datamined drop list published here before the event started to decide how much I wanted to grind.  I was already in WS when the list was published, so I checked the bot vendors.    1200 was the asking price.  
---
They weren't on my list of I gotta have it - got them grinding the event for the stuff I really wanted.  No idea of the current price point asked by player vendors.
---
Why do you complaint?
---
Wow, what kind of high roller PC servers is everyone hanging out on?!?
---
The most expensive Biv drink I keep in my Booze ATM, is Vintage Tickblood Tequilla at 100 caps each. Everything else, is just double digits, some of them just 5 caps each, and I can barely sell anything. I price Nuka Dark at 30 caps, and it just sits there forever.
---
Np! And same! I actually like the game, tried other onlines and keep coming back to this one. Think of something or a build and hop to it, on the hunt atm for a suppressors gamma gun üòÄ
---
Please tell me you are on PC I am always trying to grind that event and i buy the cards and seem to get the most confused group of people everytime.
---
Why don't you mind your business?
---
Out of probably 10k at the purveyor I‚Äôve gotten 3, first was a ghoul slayers double vats crits then these 2. So really only the furious double vats is useful.
---
Boooo.
---
LOL. I won't wear it. Yeah the Strength perks are standard. Actually all the Single Handed perks are needed. 
---
 As I have watched so many get mobbed, and as I can just back into a corner after summoning the entire Club and pile them up, in front of me, I kinda doubt an unoptimized build in Excavator has a chance.
---
I e seen that when enemies spawn in and fall into the world but die on impact
---
Yea I haven‚Äôt canceled mine but was wanting to re new it (just paying monthly through Microsoft points) and can‚Äôt find out where to do it.
---
What if they get banned for using private worlds or the scrap box without a membership?
---
Bethesda goes a bit swing crazy with there ban hammer sometimes.
---
i like generic better than cheezy.  this isnt fortnite....... um wait. one giant map.. building giant structures out of wood and metal.... random weapons drops... overpriced item shop... monthly subscription.... weekly challenges... floor traps...
---
One spawns on top of WestTec, you need jump mutation or jetpack.  You can server hop to farm them.
---
I don‚Äôt play anymore but used to sell one for like 500-1000 caps because people thought it was a steal.
---
I had to buy mutations for stock to work around caps limit on my pie business.
---
Oh ok
---
Dude, free stuff?
---
I also cancelled mine and still have access to the private world and scrap box

~proceeds to use a broken meat hook.
---
Hahaha you‚Äôd be surprised. Sometimes I can‚Äôt even figure out how I killed them.
---
Lol.  No, it's that it isn't PvP when somebody stealths in while somebody is distracted playing with the OTHER side of workshops: the actual workshop, and then they pay the caps and drop the bomb in seconds.  That isn't PvP, as this poster said.
---
You can whine about people whining about it being broken and it won't change anything about the facts it is broken :)
---
That would be cool to see brought back
---
I've rebuilt my base like 30 times because of this.
---
only pieces of shit play nw
---
Anyways the one invisible will make the first shot so very likely will win no matter if you have tesla
---
And that's how much it'll cost you once it's in the atom store.
---
Just start playing and look at the quests available
---
Seems to me like that‚Äôs player vs player since it‚Äôs 2 players in an engagement but go off salty sis lmao
---
Cleveland Steamer +3 STR, -10 PER.
---
If I come across one, I'll send it your way!
---
Sadly I'm on xbox , but I'm sure that if you make a post looking for a group to grind the event someone that knows how to do it will help you
---
At launch?? Shit it‚Äôs the first time it‚Äôs happened to me and so it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve known about it. Learn something new and I‚Äôve played since beta
---
Some toilet seats are heated and have ass sprayers
---
Yea it's not letting me see the posts without age verification. I noticed this with the atom shop update post from last week, too (not sure if it's the same poster).
---
I don't have an imgur account or interest in getting one, so I just jumped in game to see what's new.
---
Wow. This is amazing.
---
How do people come up with all this creative stuff?
---
My camp is just the bare necessities and looks like it was made by a hobo with a drinking problem and a shotgun. 
---
https://youtu.be/6KIJtFVHPPI
---
They are all discounted. Sometimes it take a bit for the x% Off bit to show in the shop after they refresh the items. Here are more details - https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1aFesqB2KkW2Nv6eUr8blG/atomic-shop-update-15-items-and-sales-november-26
---
Is this on PC?
---
Not going to downvote but I don‚Äôt understand the point. You want a free trial of a Scrapbox? Or a free trial of a NCR Ranger skin? Can you explain a little more what you would like to try out?
---
thanks! yea ive tried those dang port a diners for years üòÇ
---
No just no
---
[Its 20% Off \(Normally 1,800 Atoms\)](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1aFesqB2KkW2Nv6eUr8blG/atomic-shop-update-15-items-and-sales-november-26)
---
Same here,  left about 6 months ago came back today and started a new character ..I‚Äôll just focus on leveling up.
---
Did get griefed already .. thanks guys. :)  Beth probably employ griefers in an attempt to get people to buy private servers :)
---
I would say a 2 week redeemable trial wouldnt be out of the question. But I think the full amount would be too much to ask.
---
Have you seen it on anyone?
---
I just started fast traveling away and sending a message to the people I‚Äôm fighting with if that glitch happens.
---
It‚Äôs not fun to play against someone with Godmode and it‚Äôs especially not fun playing with it when it happens to you. Can‚Äôt see shit in first person and sometimes that weird face thing happens and you can‚Äôt see in first person.
---
I think the voice is tied to the Chest. You could just swap that out for normal paint or other Atom Paint/models and not get the voice lines.
---
Tbh what should have happened was 1st behaved as normal. But give all players a mini scrap box that has limited amount of space. That way 1st still is a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù option. 
---
But pre release of 1st would have been better overall. People still get their riot armour and try out the private worlds and afterwards can make a healthy choice on whether to buy it of not.
---
The beauty of a game like this is that you can literally do whatever you want to do. 
---
What do you like to do? Some people like to sell gear in their shop. Some people like to do events. Some people just wander around killing things and collecting loot. 
---
It‚Äôs hard to tell someone what to do since you‚Äôre idea of ‚Äúfun‚Äù may be completely different than mine. 
---
Or I can give you a list of things I was going to do tonight and you can do that. Lemme know!
---
&gt; Centurion Helmet
---
Do things just get auto rewarded in Nuclear Winter? Do you have to unlock certain achievements? I'm level 15 or so, but I'm probably never going to win and I'm rarely able to kill before getting killed.
---
Dope! You could use a green bandana too for extra matchy-ness.
---
Yes then I‚Äôll kill you and take my caps back double profit
---
I was wrong about 2 and 3-star; those are 5% and 1%, respectively.
---
Here are the numbers straight from the game data: 
---
https://i.imgur.com/NTUbmsO.png
---
You have some leeway in the billing cycle. I got my 1st on the 23 last month and just now got charged for month 2. 
---
Check whatever platform you use to play for your account info and see what the date is/was and add 4-7 days on that for a rough timeframe to renew.
---
Yeah, think you'll find the hook is about the least broken thing about this build, but I stand by the statement, I used only current in game mechanics, don't hate the player dude.
---
Same problem and solution on xb1 unfortunately. I wonder if PC has the same issue as consoles.
---
Next time just tell him youd love to give him FREE weapons AND armor but he has to go out and find them for you.  You see, you hid all of your best weapons and armor in the game world on 3 star legendary creatures and now you can't find them all again. All he has to do is find the appropriate legendary creature, kill it, and claim his prize.
---
Folks, do not forget to wear power armor when visiting to avoid the opportunity to learn how to fly.
---
Holy hell, I love it. Hey btw of you're on Xbox then come check put my bar/workshop/vendor camp. It's pretty basic cause I dont have all the Atomic Shop stuff but I still like it and I'd like others to check it out.
---
I love the Multicamp idea and have long that this is a big missing aspect of the game.  I love camp building, but part of me dies when I move camps because I know I'll never see the old camp that I spent hours building again.  The blueprinting system is terrible for anything other than small builds.  The multicamp solves all this.
---
Would be cool if launching a nuke left an ash storm nearby. It could look like Christmas a little bit!
---
I dont hate you, I would use one if I had one with fss or pwr attack. Currently just have a bloodied meat hook. I'm just saying that the title was misleading.
---
Where is the gold handmade?
---
You have to be the party leader for a few quests to show up.  Promote him to leader.
---
OMG thank you.
---
Any ETA on a fix? Fast travel bugs suck, especially since they eat caps when putting you off target.
---
I shouldn't have to fast travel 4 times, only to eventually be placed below the world, then get killed and have to respawn through no fault of my own.
---
Always got to help the lower levels, had a level 6 and a level 8 when I did it three days ago and I stimmed them to keep them alive
---
I've had the entire clubhouse respawn as level 1 legendary diseased eyebots.  The number of things wrong with that statement are mindboggling.
---
I need a kilt and a big bushy beard and a Saint Bernard.  That's all I want.
---
3 4 and 76 are entirely non canon in my eyes.
---
have Tesla Coils on your Power Armor?
---
TURKEY OUTFIT
---
Thank you, kind poster. You have made my day &lt;3
---
Should bought a lottery ticket :(
---
I feel like a solid hundred for those of us without a ton of money. Because for me at least by the time I grind up enough atoms the item is gone
---
It was his sickle, and he was number one.
---
Omg yesss
---
Not in the game at the moment, missed my chance to get it now I gotta wait for it to come back...
---
I'd like a wheelbarrow.... Full of caps.
---
Oh dear haha I‚Äôm guessing you got god tear items but they were all level one
---
I just wish they'd lower the damn price. We're already paying a subscription just to play online on console as it is. I know the monthly fee for FO1st technically pays for itself with the atoms you get but $12/month for a single game is still absurdly high. At most it should only be $5/month and maybe $40-50/year. 
---
In an ideal world, they would've just given the scrapbox to everybody considering how much of a massive benefit it is. Then again, I guess that's the point.
---
Damn it, everyone today has things i want on the wrong bloody platform....
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
Yeah how about not!
---
Yes. People who play nuclear winter. It‚Äôs one of the higher tier rewards.
---
Think we are going to have to agree to disagree on what a glitch is. There are other weapons in the game that double dip into perks, and there has never been a firm answer whether this was intended or not. No worries though, have a good one.
---
Thank you! And wow I did not see that trailer coming :D
---
I also don't have an imgur qccount. For what thats worth.
---
It‚Äôs listed for 600
---
I really like the Toxic Valley scenery, but wish there was end game stuff for me to do there... I agree with what you said. There needs to be a higher difficulty mode.
---
I made it kinda foolproof, so you have to jump over the fence or exit through the fuzzy ride to die. That's not counting any blue screens of course :D I can't guarantee that's not gonna happen
---
First, go to a Railroad Station and read all of the posters on the wall. It'll update you on pretty much all of the new stuff you've missed out on. 
---
The Tadpole/Possum challenges will keep you busy for a good while if you're looking for a place to start.
---
It is a part of the Uncanny Caverns self guided tour. The whole cavern is laden with satirical ‚Äúpremium‚Äù content that should only be explored by tourists that had purchased the ‚ÄúPremium explorers pass‚Äù.
---
My eyes were rolling out the back of my head as I donned my NCR trench coat to complete the experience.
---
Thank you! And I'm on ps - post some pictures tho!
---
Nah, I dont think I should. I've seen some of the other settlements and I know that mine wont even begin to compare.
---
Winter Camo yeah sorry i though you meant Blackbird.
---
I wanted to make Butch my character in 76 sooo bad but they took away his hairstyle back in FO4 and it sadly didn't return for 76. So instead I made Hank Hill my character. lmao
---
Are you asking if it‚Äôs possible? I doubt it seriously. If it were so, you would only need animal friend to tame.
---
Nice. Might not be a popular opinion, but I say if you launch the nuke in a public server you can do whatever you want with the queen.
---
I'm sure it's not that bad!
---
Is it because robots don't spawn randomly?
---
Does the fast travel point move if you rotate the Camp device? It seems inconsistent most of the time
---
I'm working on those now! Hit a block with the badges cuz I cant seem to find one of those damn cameras lol
---
üßê
---
Sir, I severely doubt that statement
---
This was my theory after the fallout 1st membership released. It seems that even when you have a desirable item that is worth spending atoms on, its 90% going to be in a bundle and if you played from beta there is most likely one or a couple items you already paid for. The best way for Bethesda to get nothing more outta me is to keep doing this exact shady shit. Also the bullshit of weeklies showing up as still completed but no atoms to show for it is predatory to say the least.
---
This is only my 3rd Camp, but I've received so many random compliments when people come to visit, I know I got it right this time.  This really bothers me, because I know, I'll most likely just begin to rebuild/try to fix it, just for this ONE thing, and then what happens if it does it again!!?? (I'm starting to realize the frustration others have towards this game.) I've had many freezes, mission glitches, as I'm sure you have, etc.  But THIS is bothering me. LOL.  This actually happened to my first camp I had as well - but I didn't know what the culprit was, well thanks for the advice on what might help resolve this - sounds like you have plenty of experience with this buggy game!
---
I didn't just rotate it but moved it too. For me it usually works. Have to move a couple of times and the spawn point is randomly placed, but with enough patience and time you can find a good spot. For this camp, you spawn on the exact top :)
---
Depending on the item you are looking for, they generally will drop around the world at the Events
---
See video link. I dropped and picked it up, and it was able to show me the contents which did jar loose a memory that I came across it ... somewhere, I just don't recall where.
---
Robots do spawn at the random locations but they are not tameable. They are generally part of a random scene, like the Mr. Handy that pleads for help, then turns into a holdup bandit. Or the nanny bot that will tell you a bedtime story. Etc.
---
*Ma'am, and there are no such things as bad bases! Just not enough decorated :D
---
I had to use fucking nightstands for the damn counter
---
That would have to be one hell of a crossbow.  Is there a laser cannon mounted on the side of it?
---
All The Ghouls at Whitesprings in Santa Hats would be cool.
---
I want the jacket because I run a Tunnel Snakes faction
---
Seems like the link is broken. If it is true that it was a world spawn item and not a leftover maintenance item it would be worth considerably less.
---
Probably more the fact that they are robots and not animals, so there is nothing to "tame".
---
If they added it to the hacker perks, then sure, but as it stands, robots are not "tamable".
---
I‚Äôm confused if this is a joke or not
---
Oh that's just usual. I use dining tables as kitchen counters, end tables as fence.. anything that looks good in the position is good enough
---
Fine I'll post one after Thanksgiving break. I'm going to Universal.
---
Hell yeah! And snowballs :D with grenades inside of course..
---
That's the spirit! Can't wait :) Have fun on your trip
---
Not being a grinch but, we would see a ton of blue (screen) lights.  Hopefully they do it in the mountains.
---
Get the free terminal from the atomic shop. It will appear on there as a report of a mysterious person.
---
The blocker perk card is your best bet against melee damage. I know thats not your question but if youre not using it you might want to give it a try
---
I have the perk on even tho it doesnt say it and i have wll the mats it says i can craft it and it makes the sound but doesnt give me xp or put it on
---
Yes that is a distant radstorm. They are a lot more common now compared to ~6+ months ago where you would see maybe 1 ever.
---
Hey, silver lining. You‚Äôre right.
---
I want a replica Jansport backpack similar to the one my mom used in college in the 70‚Äôs. 
---
Oh and also let‚Äôs add FANNY PACKS as a backpack skin. üòÇüòÇ
---
yeah i know, but I worded that badly.  I meant to say that it should be changed so that it's a net 0 caps activity.  
---
In any event though, as someone who is cap maxed on 3 characters with a 4th that is intentionally left short to sell stuff, I don't really care if people exploit for caps as they are imo ultimately, worthless.  Still though I agree a system that makes it easy is a bad idea.
---
But did you completed that challenge that required you to kill the SBQ ?
---
Lol like 10 legos all in all, all 1 stars.  Dumped it in the overseers catch in Flatwoods.  Hopefully someone got some use out of it all.
---
Try the rabbits at the gold markers [here](https://i.imgur.com/bnRQqAY.png).
---
Is the hook power attack?
---
Have any context for that quote?
---
Nice. Honestly, I'm surprised they haven't already added the jacket to the Atomic Shop at some point. The Tunnel Snakes have always been a fan favorite and surely Bethesda knows it'd be a popular item.
---
I haven't
---
I haven't been able to submit a support ticket to Bethesda because something is causing the forms to constantly refresh to such a point I can't get the form completed.  I figured it is something on Bethesda's end since I tried three different browsers on two PCs and I even tried it on an iMac.  All had the page constantly refreshing.
---
:D I did not. That's really is broken.
---
I canceled mine the first day and have been riding out the month, and still have access to all the stuff too. Lets see how long this goes.
---
Itd be my guess that they are just mistagged. Would explain why both arent behaving as they should.
---
Well that's a pain. They used to be able to be broken when shot
---
*nods*
---
Your nuke, your choice.
---
Said that in my personal experience for the most part attending 'third party nukes' has been an 'unneeded is not the same as unwanted' experience.
---
I only recall one occasion - out of 100s - when I was treated like a malignant growth.
---
Only if it is at a significant discount. That was probably the most expensive bundle they sold.
---
Yeah hopefully they will
---
B+40Power attack +1Str hook, its a beast.
---
Quite impressive to see.. 
---
Got into my Hazmat suit just in case it drifted my way but it never did.
---
Got my first storm the other day in the same spot.
---
This is the content I crave and the reason I keep returning to this website.
---
Rad storms are not lethal. They are just random ticks of low rads here and there. Harmless really.
---
You need a broken prosnap deluxe camera to craft another one i think.
---
Im sorry, but if you are in a team sharing perks, and having your teammates revive you, then this was not solo.
---
I dunno about that, but that PA is either a Secret Services PA, or the Presidential T-60 that is mentionned in the terminals of the Presidential Room of the Whitespring Bunker. Either way, it means that its linked to the Enclave, with the Secret Services being tied to the Enclave since it was implemented in the lore in Fallout 2. Im not hopping for a Franck Horrigan kind of boss, but rather a Fallout 2 like Enclave that we could join. Also the dude in PA is going to a BoS location, as we see from the flags in the trailer.
---
Oh ty! I wondered wtf that was for lol.
---
There‚Äôs a location u can center ur base around and have a cat that wanders ur base. Have u tried that?
---
It's a furious deathclaw Gauntlet with 50% limb damage and damage increased after each consecutive hit to the same Target
---
This is now my new radio for FO76 !
---
Ty
---
Main character 390, Alt1 160ish, 3 and 4 are mules... 3 and 4 are max caps.... main and alt over 25K each and i have some weapons that I will probably never sell but could get 30-50K in a pinch if needed...Right now i have just started buying serum recipes and selling serums....takes some major caps shuffling to do.
---
I'm pretty sold on the spot my camp is currently at. I just thought it'd be a cute idea so everyone could have a cat of their own. lol
---
Haha I hear u I thought it was a cool base location where u can get the cat. At least they have one place rn
---
And please mark our pets as essential
---
Gotta give the player a pass on this one.
---
I takes removing one keyword from the record (probably the one handed keyword unless you want people in PA using this weapon) to fix it and it was reported in November last year!
---
One year and they have not removed a single keyword - if you have the CK open a 10 second job including the time it takes you to find the relevant record - that would have no chance on having a knock-on effect on anything else.
---
At this point one has to read 'working as intended' and move on.
---
this is also true for things on the other side of the wall, such as lights or power conduits
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter what any company does, if a person finds something of value or pleasure with it and it‚Äôs a value they can justify they will buy it. Yes you need to look at your financial standing sure, but you have an option. No company had a gun to your head saying to buy what they are selling. You might want what they are selling but doesn‚Äôt mean you need it. 
---
Not everything in the world you want is attainable. You can not go around screaming and crying on reddit that ‚Äúoh ____ is ripping people off, milking customers for everything‚Äù. No, no they are not. When you create something it has value, they price something and the consumer decides if it‚Äôs a price they want to pay. If the price is high and people don‚Äôt buy then the company will suffer. So far it doesn‚Äôt look like Bethesda is suffering. Looks like you are because you‚Äôre here bitching.
---
No I don‚Äôt go around price checking every single game, I personally don‚Äôt give a flying f* what people charge UNLESS I‚Äôm playing the game and buying it. If I think it‚Äôs to much guess what.... I don‚Äôt buy it. I am not a companies wet dream in the slightest. 
---
Do you have Netflix? Hulu? Spotify? Apple Music? What ever else subscriptions are where ever you live. How many movies do you watch or music do you listen to? Not everything they offer I bet. So how are they not ripping you off? Why the hell are you paying for 10000+ movies, 1 million+ songs when you only watch or listen to &lt;1%?  You buy and justify buying by entertainment value, if you don‚Äôt get anything from it than you don‚Äôt need it and you don‚Äôt purchase it.
---
add amazon kindle pipboy integration
---
Great personal achievement 
---
Well done!
---
Those random critter spawn locations have all been mapped with [YASSM (Yet Another 76 Map\)](https://dan-parker.github.io/YASSM/).  Just select the "Critter Spawn" tick box in the top right corner.
---
The static rabbit spawns are also mapped out with Map76 [here](https://map76.com/npc_/lvlcritterrabbitnpc_004f60db). Deselect "Show Map Locations" at the top left for better visibility.
---
Server hop?

---
Yeah I've been looking for a good meat hook but no one's willing to give up there and I can't seem to find one of my own
---
He hasn‚Äôt logged back in since so I‚Äôll let him know
---
Nit picking, he was the only one doing damage. What a crazy useless thing to do! I love it!
---
Yeah I already put the third Claw on there thank you
---
Whenever I've gotten on a factions bad side (aka, accidentally hitting a white springs bot) I've just had to hop out and back in
---
That's a pretty good idea and Bethesda should maybe consider such an option. It'd also kind of resolve the issue that some high-levels love to ruin events for low-levels with their end game weapons and that's no fun. :/
---
Solo means alone, with no help from others.
---
He was getting perk benefits from a teammate, and most likely strange in numbers which has a huge increase for DPS and damage dealt when in a team.
---
So if he comes back and does it truely solo, then I might be impressed, but as it sits in the video, this is not solo.  You cannot get those damage numbers without padding mutations with strange in numbers
---
Fallout 3 Raider, Settler and Mercenary outfits, Ashur‚Äôs Power Armour as a skin from The Pitt DLC, Ghoul Mask, The Antagoniser, Ghoul/Scorched/Super Mutant polymorph like they do in ESO, Mascot heads of previous fallout characters and beasts, Frank Horrigan, A Deathclaw, Cazodor, Scorchbeast
---
Just a few ideas off the top of my head
---
Those would be awesome
---
you can tame a cat
---
I think The Fixer is the Uber weapon for sneak builds, but the Tesla still has the lionshare in the trades I know of.
---
There's also one location where you can have a pet dog in camp too.
---
me too homie i'm gonna check it out. looks badass. kudos.
---
Rad storms are less dangerous than petrified corpses
---
Oh, ok, I better transfer some Bloodied weapons to my Junkies characters and my other full health commando that uses AAE25 handmade cuz Bloodied is always better, no matter what, thanks for the input.
---
I guess that's down to semantics, as I was also playing the team mate, 2 sessions open :), So yes, 1 person did this, also known as solo. 
---
  But I take your point, teaming up was 1 of many mechanics I needed to do get the numbers, look forward with interest to anyone doing this whilst not on a team  (I think it could be done incidentally).
---
Oh it's not a matter of "if I wanna return", I'm gonna play. I'm just confused by the new stuff! (Tho I do agree with that, insult bot is my new fave thing)
---
Really? I never knew of that one. Badass!
---
It took me a few days to get mine too. If you dont get them in the next couple of days Id send in a ticket for it.
---
I need more people to play with to I‚Äôm on mostly on the weekends 
---
GT: KSI ToxxicDucky
---
Against a TSE, yes.  Read the rest of my posts on this thread.  I actually recommended AA and Furious as alternatives for a non bloodied build. 
---
But just like Democrats, you only see what you want. 
---
For a full health build I actually stated AA Vamps and Furious.
---
Ight I'll add ya!
---
Seriously at first I thought this game was trash. I bought it for cheap decided to give it another chance. I love it been playing it for days now and I love it
---
It can be done, I've done a build there. place your camp at the base. Then build stairs up and around as high as you can using half floors when needed. Then you have to jump into the satellite through one of the damaged openings which can be tricky. Once you do that you simply replace your camp inside the dish. Once you do that you'll be able to build from the ground up. 9 stories total.
---
i dont have the link but i saw a youtube video of someone who said he managed to do it by building nearby and using a jetpack from his selfmade launching platform )cant confirm though
---
Damn, just had this happen and lost a decent amount of caps on heaps of ammo being sold. Had to alt+f4 to stop loosing items and caps to too many buyers buying all at once. Would have been nice to know about this limit in advance :(  
---
Seeing that message change form '29.8k caps to 'MAX caps' was a smack in the face for sure.
---
No unfortunately it doesnt exist for pipe weapons. I would imagine trying to fire a 50 cal out of an old rusty pipe would make it explode in your face
---
That outfit is so cool. Damn I want it but must wait for Christmas. Can‚Äôt go missing out on Santa outfit again.
---
Doesn‚Äôt that only spawn 1 star legendaries?
---
Nice that super helpful. I was worried he would have to start a new character
---
Well made. Second level down looks a little like a skating rink. My favorite part is the use of the existing wall, the stacked stone ends stand  out.
---
That would be so cool to put that behind not one, but two paywalls. Yeah...
---
Or people who want to do real damage.
---
You should be able to toggle between low/high level servers.
---
But then again, this is an option that should have been around since launch, for free.
---
Bruh they reported it they wouldnt have found the bugs had they not
---
Thats interesting. I didnt even know that was a BOS location in the trailer.
---
Thnx for formal my dude
---
They anger quickly but don‚Äôt hold a grudge. Server hopping will do it. Useful for me when I forget to swap guns and use explosive weapons too close to the Whitesprings doormen...
---
Its true
---
They do it all shoukd have been why i quit bethesda lol
---
Hiss at it. Or wet your hand in the sink and flick at it's face.
---
Aw so it's basically the flag pose. Was hoping for something different. Don't know how hard I want to farm for it lol
---
Sure bru
---
No I think canvas is still in a massive shortage right now
---
Trade it in for a lizard.
---
Botting a second toon is not considerd solo, its considered botting.
---
! person with 2 toons is not solo, its botting.
---
submit a ticket
---
developers might force the furry monster to wright an essay about appropriate and inappropriate places to sleep
---
Sturges outfit plz
---
Cost: 5 Wood, 6 steel, 3 circuitry, &amp; 100 asbestos
---
That would be a cool one
---
Sure, but it better be 16x's the Snow &amp;/or Snowfall!
---
That‚Äôs so ridiculous and cool at the same time 
---
My .556 and .50 ammo wants to learn more about the meat hook
---
&gt;pain pain in the butt but
---
Would also like -
---
Wooden full length staircase
---
Non broken barn windows
---
More fireplace options
---
More large, luxury beds - not the same reskined children's bed
---
Arcade machines
---
Manually being able to sink items into the ground
---
Strange but only a .05 out of 10 on the game breaking scale when I can't fast travel on 50% of attempts or respawn when I die in a major event.   Or even swap weapons reliably.
---
Only they do a dog bowl too for a wolf that collects bones
---
Ok so then we aren't even arguing (and I don't know wtf politics have to do with this conversation at all).
---
I don't mind having these discussions about what is optimal and when, but the only time a Bloodied weapon outperforms anything like a TS weapon is when you are at like 70% health. So Bloodied is always better provided you are not above 70% health.
---
And I don't like furious at all, I have a furious DCG for when my Meathook breaks, but thats about it. Makes little sense to use Furious when most things die in 2 or 3 rounds anyway.
---
Maybe follow the rules yourself before telling others what to do?
---
# Zoinks! You've taken a wrong turn.
---
Let's split up, gang. If you're looking for an image, it's probably been deleted or may not have existed at all.
---
Fair enough, some really interesting points, good talking to you.
---
Have a laugh
---
Aww, cat needs attention.  Leave the game üò§
---
I actually like it like this :D But actually just couldn't edit the post unfortunately
---
Right I see, not exactly a very well thought out discount sale for a Black Friday to be quite fair ,_,
---
These things and many others(maybe even atoms) could have been on sale for like a flat 50% off tag, that would have caused many more people to buy atoms but...I guess that's that.
---
The confusion is really the joke. It‚Äôs actually in game, but it‚Äôs a part of the world that existed before the bombs dropped, so as a survivor we get to experience the premium content without purchasing anything... because everyone is dead :)
---
Maybe add music Holo tapes we can find in game, and then put them into the jukebox.
---
Careful, once you go hook, your hooked.  But in all seriousness, this is an awful build, not shown on the video is 100's of times I've been wiped out by a tick or bloatfly.  There are some less intense melee builds that get the job done.
---
If it was even close to funny or clever i probably would
---
NSFW / I need an account? WTF
---
The stuff in the sale tab will change with discounts on different days. So it is kinda giving you notice what will be on sale this week.
---
pretty much, looks like the "camp" team up animations with the 94 flag to me
---
Why can't that be set to the jukebox üòÅ
---
That's their wonderful lighting system for ya
---
And it's interesting to me that you tell me to read your other posts wherein you mention all this other shit OP didn't ask about, yet I cannot. You don't fucking know what you are talking about, Bloodied is not ALWAYS better than Two shot you stupid fuck because a non-bloodied build isn't ALWAYS at 70% or less health. It sounds to me like you already sat on a fucking stick you goddamn dullard, take your fucktarded political grievances and crawl back into your mommys snatch
---
PvP implies a consensual relationship.  Recall the subtle wording of the workshop: Other players /may/ come initiate PvP.  That isn't saying: Other players /will/ come, without warning, and you will have 3 seconds to respond before you are dead.
---
It is because of that behavior that workshops are largely unused anymore, except for those who don't realize it's just a playground for immature players who like to play unbalanced.
---
How interesting would it be if the way football worked is you had the teams playing each other, but at any point during the game a squad of assault marines could instantly appear on the field, gun down all the players in less than a second, and then walk around thinking they were hot stuff... would that be any fun to play football anymore?
---
But is it okay if the arena had a sign on it saying: "warning, playing in this arena means that at any time assault marines MAY appear and kill you."
---
You'd probably endup with a similar thing, like with workshops right now.  All the players would stop playing "football," except for the naive, because of toxic behavior.
---
It is TOXIC, because it has disrupted and poisoned/ruined an ecosystem.
---
If, instead, as the OP and others have commented, they just made some simple improvements that would bring it back to "PvP" instead of "P gets ganked" then yeah, it's PvP.
---
Right now, it isn't PvP.
---
Would have made sense, but nope
---
Okay Cap
---
a bowl of catnip and a linolium floor will do the trick.
---
Excavator is not much use in my experience.
---
you need a higher fire rate weapon than a pump shotty.  try a medic flamer ( theres a heal with flamer perk) or auto pistol/rifle....medics only heals with crits.  team medic perk in charisma.  build your camp near tick spawns.  wear tanky power armour.
---
It‚Äôs the exact spot on your map where the train tracks converge at harper‚Äôs ferry. It‚Äôs up on the high cliff overlooking the town. There‚Äôs a skeleton couple there and a living dog who stands guard near them.
---
Some private servers never spawn legendaries. You have to do a run through WestTek to find out.
---
This.  You can also use the same technique to place your C.A.M.P. in a tree to build tall.
---
I would not make this a bloodied build. For my medic I did a combination of Vanguards and Bolstering Armors to have a mixed effect. I don‚Äôt want my armor to be less at lower health but I also want more armor when at higher health so taking care of the group is important but you also need self-preservation.
---
I know people bash on it but I‚Äôm going with a Flamer/Medic Build where the Flamer heals the group also when needed.
---
This bug = hard stop on getting FO 1st for me.
---
I'll take having America's ass all day over posting low effort, garbage memes
---
I‚Äôm getting them too
---
I have 5 chars and it happens 50% of the time on 3, and never on 2.  Puzzling
---
Oh the blackbird paint has reappeared, it's a nice one for the armours. If you've got the atoms to spare and you're a PA user, it's one well worth picking up, as it's only appeared a couple of times.
---
Exactly
---
After the last year youd think they'd be used to a little friendly fire.  As the guys above said, if you upset the whitespring or bunker staff just server hop.  They forget immediately.
---
You are welcome
---
Focus on leveling up charisma for most people on your team but your self especialy as with the lerk that allows the food and drink items you consume to also fill the food and drink bars of your team mates they will onmy need to carry stim packs and maybe some chems in there aid slot saving out on aload of carryweight early on which is great to nap and then some pf the obvious perks like pharma pharma and the other one that meams you gain more xp in a group
---
Maybe stop rewarding their ineptitude with a subscription?
---
First thing I tried, makes no difference for me
---
You're welcome
---
A shameful day for the free states.  That tinfoil hat can be dangerous.  Thanks for the synopsis.
---
I hate tanking SBQ anymore, nobody gets adds off you like they used to. Must be all these geniuses using Bloodied weapons at full health thinking they are doing "real damage"
---
And yet I'm standing in the clear in my camp, no enemies around, haven't taken damage for minutes, and after a couple of tries it randomly works.   not saying you're wrong as such just that the \*reason\* this happens isn't very important, the degree to which is pisses me of is what matters:)
---
I do have several armor pieces laying around that have reduced food/drink/chem weight, so I'll probably use those rather than investing perk points into Traveling Pharmacy/Thru Hiker.
---
No use in reasoning
---
Awww how cute. I may look into building my base there thanks!
---
If that works ever time for the next 10 times it's good to know, otherwise it was chance
---
I personally prefer heavy guns over shotgun for team medic. Easy to hold you own and still have all the perks to stimpak your group.
---
Yea thats a good shout
---
The "rarer" ones: champagne, Tickblood tequila go for way more, but I sell old possum and such at 250.
---
Junkies is a lot of fun. You can stay at full health pretty easy, get some vanguards armor and whatever weapon you want to use with Junkies prefix. If you end up not liking it, you just use an Addictol and do something else, it's no sweat.
---
I'm not hopping 4 characters to buy your crap, sorry lol.
---
I hadn't thought of utilizing a Flamer, but I do have a Medic's/50% crit/25% less AP cost Flamer laying around.  Maybe I'll work that into the build since I wouldn't need to adjust my SPECIAL at all and just use heavy gun perks instead.  I will say though that Medic's shotguns have really good burst healing, so perhaps I'll invest in both and swap them around depending on the situation.
---
I've got a berserker char that never has that issue either but my VATS sniper char does.  I've seen people say it could be the outfit  / armour, maybe I should try wearing some unyeilding on my berzerker and see if it breaks fast travel?
---
Good God, you're a broken record.
---
Because of the swarm tactics, I want to use the 3-4 point splash damage as a crippler with Enforcer perk, shooting the ground to specifically get leg hits.  I‚Äôm specced into rifles on one character and heavies on the other, but both have a combat shotgun with limb damage effects.  It works great, but because of the pace of the raid and speed of ghouls, I want something that requires 0 aim.
---
well shit, thats gonna hurt expert this week
---
Wish the free states items would make a return
---
yeah because they would know how frustrating it is. Also marketing because I assume this bug pisses others off like it does me - I refuse to buy FO 1st while this bug exists, as my levels of frustration with it are so high
---
search for "raid 2 man expert guide"  the OP has a ton of tips in there, worth a read
---
I'm on for the next few hours. PSN: VeltScroll
---
Don't most heavy guns have really high VATS costs though?  I suppose I could use the Friendly Fire perk with my Medic's Flamer and heal teammates that way, but it can be hard to maintain the fuel to really make it my primary weapon.
---
Do Uranium Fever! 3 garuanteed legendary, at least good scrip, only downside is lvl 40, but some stuff still worth using.
---
yes it will.
---
Messing around on Private servers to see if they like it, get a taste of using the overpowered insta-scrap/sleep/stash/cook/guitar tent etc... I bet a lot of people would buy the year like I did if they just try it out. The emotes and shit are stupid, but the Non-Free Content behind it is pretty decent.
---
Its 12 bucks for a full month.  You can't risk 12 dollars to see if you like it and get your ranger armor/scrap box?  I mean honestly  if 12 bucks is too much to see if you are going to like it how are you going to afford it monthly?  The whole thing is nonsensical unless you just want the ranger armor and a scrap box to quickly fill to bursting.
---
I‚Äôve never done uranium fever! Always wondered why so many people did it! Thanks for the tip my man
---
Ive seen a lot of trials where you just get charged again if you don't cancel in time. Im sure they'd do something like that.
---
Which event is this?
---
There are only 2 perks specific to bloodied builds.   Nerd Rage and Serendipity
---
Everything else that makes a bloodied build is either mutations, or gear.
---
For a sniper build there are a few must haves.  
---
All snipers will need Rifleman perks maxed and Tank Killer.  Concentrated fire is a bonus, but not a required perk, depends on how well you like Vats targeting (i hate it because it doesnt sync with gun fu very well)
---
You will want Mr Sandman slotted with Covert Ops for maximum sneak damage (make sure you slot Mr Sandman first for an extra .25x damage)
---
If you use mutations, Starched Genes and Class Freak.  Bloody Mess as well.
---
Tenderizer in Cha will get  you more damage on your second and consecutive hits.
---
Gunsmith and/or Demo Expert (if you use explosive guns)
---
This should get you started.  Put the rest of your points into your preferences, but the above perks will give you the meat and potatoes of a sneak sniper build.
---
If you want auto rifles, use commando instead of rifleman, the rest is the same.
---
I know that it's from that event, I have them. Did you get them from event?
---
Always wanted to make a ranger tower.
---
Gotcha. I think I see where you‚Äôre coming from but I think the fact that you can just do a month‚Äôs sub to see if you like it is about the most you can ask for.
---
Is it for this mission, or a different one?
---
You don't need to have hard bargain to get the most out of selling things. Everything is hard capped at 25% of the actual value of the item.  So all you need is 16 in Charisma which you can easily get if you have a full set of unyielding of anything (+15 charisma).  No need to move special points.  And you can always craft sweet rolls that give you +3.  And if you really want to go overboard, drink some alcohol for that +1.  All in all, you only need to get to 16, anything more is just wasteful.
---
Thank you! This has been very informative, and a huge help!
---
This is my full health sneak ranger/sniper. All you need is a good Instigating lever or fixer and your set. With mutations and gear my agi and per is at 23.

Yeah, most folks probably have a friend or something they can just see the benefits of it. Personally I think they just should have charged for servers and some outfits and gave the box and tent as in game quests for free. But here we are...
---
it includes all 3!  a bit of scrolling may be required though since washout is near the bottom
---
Ran 6 SBQs last night and never crashed once on XBOX...Also, maybe hook up with someone on running the silo....Can easily be done in 7-10 minutes solo and not use so many resources (there are tips to learn when doing it)....Happy hunting!!
---
Zoolander?
---
Lvl 240 here and I still do UF every time it‚Äôs up.  3 legendaries to scrip or flip and 200 steel.
---
I use this but run a instigating leveraction instead
---
I've seen two random friendly bots discussing life. Forget the names.
---
You can logoff, that's the main concern xD
---
There‚Äôs an old vid up on YouTube where someone built a camp around Murgles
---
I've even changed my keyboard out (for other reasons, couple keys stopped working), and it happens with the new keyboard too. I have a Kinesis Gaming Split keyboard now.
---
I have three children don‚Äôt talk to me about monsters blocking/turning off/changing channels they are horrible lol
---
Anytime! It's not perfect but it works for me. I could get more critical perks or other damage increasing perks by removing some of the convenience perks but its seems a little over kill.
---
Solo in a team. Until you do it solo you haven‚Äôt done it solo.
---
Wait. Are you saying that there was more than building and decorating houses/gardens/apartments? 
---
I never played the actual game outside of building and decorating üòÖ
---
Add a new NW map.  What happened with the rotating maps!?
---
That medics flamer is perfect.  Exactly what a team medic needs with the flamer healing perk in charisma.  I would say use power armor too for durability and damage resist.  Test commando and auto medics rifles with less vat cost instead of the shotty as you are going to be perking into heavy gun on the flamer and as you know shotty perks are also on the strength tree.  I think ditch the shotty but you might find reason to keep it that I havent considered.  Again, high fire rate and less vats action point cost is better for a medics weapon. You can also consider the perk that revives with alcohol as well as the operk that buffs your teammates damage when you revive them.  empath would be a good mutation as well for a medic.
---
It's truly the top fuel dragster of builds. Incredibly powerful and impressive, if only for a moment, and only if it holds together. Cool to see it work.
---
Maybe it was white 25 years ago.
---
Any chance of a Spotify mix?!

---
U did shoot it so... not 1 shot
---
Yup, Syringer. As I wrote, I pvp a lot. Not with this glitch though, no fun in that.
---
Redbox already bought that disc from Bethesda - they got their $$ for that disc. Black Friday deals? The place offering already bought the game from Bethesda and so they've gotten their $$ for those discs too.
---
Free to play means Bethesda stops making money from people buying the game. And since atom sales aren't enough to supplement the flagging base game sales, they had to introduce 1st. And now they should drop base sales? How is that income going to be covered?
---
People already use the fact that they bought the base game a year ago to demand DLC/content for free in perpetuity (in fairness this is something Bethesda promised back at the start). What happens to that argument if the base games goes F2P? Do people start paying for DLC?
---
Thanks man, it was a fun ride.
---
SUre but then a lot of people would not be willing to shell out the money for just Private servers.  Don't get me wrong I would prefer that, would save me money.
---
Unequip your armour
---
yuck
---
thanks for this brilliant guide, this is going to help üòçüëç
---
Is the pipe variants counting towards rifle and pistol perks also a glitch?
---
Really, everyone covered everything I would have said. I do want to reiterate one point though. 
---
Established, higher level players often have every mutation recipe but often don‚Äôt stock all in their machines due to some being much more popular than others (Herd Mentality versus Marsupial for example). 
---
It never hurts to DM the seller and ask about mutations you don‚Äôt see in their machines but they might indeed have. Also, many (including myself) gift mutations to players. If I‚Äôm at my camp when someone buys a few mutations, I‚Äôll often drop them a few more as a GWP (Gift with Purchase). I usually pick more obscure ones to drop and if the player is a low level, I‚Äôll let them know that they can always sell then for 400+ caps to bot vendors.
---
Do know in order to do decent damage to the queen you need the right perk cards. (Also the queen has ~70% damage reduction)
---
I believe that package is vaulted once again as of this writing. I was saving my atoms to get it but I was too late. :(
---
I also shot her a few times before she lands to get her attention, man this post really is inaccurate.
---
You can. With robotic expert in the Intelligence stat. Dont know if you can send then to your camp, but you can pacify them.
---
yup, I was also in a team, seriously what was I thinking when I posted this? /me hangs head in shame.
---
Yeah, the last part is the kicker, my entire defense is sneak, when that breaks I'm broke.
---
Yes your whole post from the very first line is inaccurate.
---
Hell a marine combat helmet would be nice
---
Lol. I love how often the same people who complain about Bethesda being greedy are the same ones who cry whenever someone won't pay 20k+ for their legendaries. 
---
I guess capitalism is only bad when you're the one paying. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It'd be a very stupid but sadly not unprecedented move if Bethesda goes against its commitment with Wastelanders being free DLC. That'd undermine the justification for their whole monetisation scheme.
---
If you thought people were pissed off now, you ain't seen nothing yet.
---
It could be the electro shock mutation procing.
---
And power armor skins. Now be honest dont you see the same value if not more in a snow machine than some ugly PA skin you might wear once.
---
Change you build to Bloodied or Junkie, and collect weapons of the same type, re perk and you can more or less do the Queen solo :) (will take some ammo, lol) 
---
TSE / TS was nerfed into the ground in my opinion :/
---
Queenie has insane DR.
---
TSE is underperforming on Queenie.  And it is not surprising you only hit for 1hp per shot. 
---
I stopped using TSEs for this very reason, they are overhypped and underperform.  My TSE mini only does 5 per shot.  My AAE Mini does 11, my Bloodied Gat Plas does 55+ and my TSE Gat Plas does 9.
---
These are my numbers at 19% or less health, full bloodied PA build with NR, EP and AR all running.
---
I recommend looking into a Furious or AA weapon, or look into Junkies or a Bloodied build for queenie slaying.
---
Either just remove them from that gamemode or make it so you can take them, initiating PvP but have to pay a higher amount and the person being stolen from has buffs
---
Yes, this has happened to me twice.
---
no, like... I literally did 1 damage. I have that thing turned on where you see how much damage you do per shot. I did 1 damage per shot.
---
Great reply 10/10. Really presented some good arguements there.
---
Great reply. 10/10. Really presented some good arguements there
---
I did it to show what some people think of us and our game not only did he trashtalked Bethesda he trashtalked us this sub and called us Fallot fan boys in a mocking tone.
---
Explosives are pretty much useless against the queen.  Also, two shot weapons do 125% damage split in 2, so 2 shots at 62.5% of your weapon damage, both of which are reduced by the queen's armor/damage reduction.  They're really not good weapons for her.
---
You'd be better off with something more aligned with that fight.
---
The Queen has really high explosive resistance so faster fire rate will generally benefit you more. How many points do you have in heavy weapons perks and are you using stabilized?
---
What platform are ya on?
---
Yes?
---
Solo can be over looked as your team mates hadnt done damage and presumably their shared perks allowed you to Essentially 1 hit and the 1 hit seems totally possible But this technically isnt it, shame too because it seemed as if the shots were not necessary STILL Good Work Dweller, Truly Impressive
---
I've never used Spotify-- I'll see what I can do tomorrow!

Heres my unarmed junkies build, It's a food build because I like to keep Green Thumb on all the time... If you use auto rifles, ground pounder is nice, despite what the card says though it works for semi-auto builds as well, although I dont use it. Its just a decent alternative, I have rifles for Fliers and trash mobs. I prefer damage mitigation over DR/ER and it seems to work fine. Using a Junkies Power Attack meathook so I rock the gladiator and iron fist perks.  
---
Im at work rn, sorry for my halfass responses, I can post my other Junkie and stealth riflemang in a few
---
Thanks, i'll check it out
---
I‚Äôm on PC.  I can either take and maintain all three pylons for the duration of the event or provide lots of DPS.  Dealers choice.  DM me and I‚Äôll add you to friends.
---
Yeah I guess you could call this one :)
---
Surely 1 or 2 lines are accurate, maybe not, who know in this post truth era.
---
I wouldn't do that ;) 
---
But really, not my style :D Always shouting on area chat in those situations
---
Well they really should have had some other package options, like Privates only for $5 or something, maybe some emotes...
---
Are you on ps4? I did a trade under this with a dude earlier and saw what looked like this exact camp?
---
Yah I sell all my booze recipes for 50 caps. And it's slow going at that.
---
Glad to hear! I've been listening to it for the last few days, it's pretty fun to blow away ferals while listening to Jingle Bells (especially Fats' version haha).
---
Yep, I am. Totally possible :)
---
My main is level 303. I have 140k caps between all my characters.
---
I give a lot away. Sell legendaries for cheap. Sell serums for cheap. Makes me money very quickly.
---
Nice, that's good info! I never have enough stimpacks to sell at this point so I can see how those would be a hot commodity!
---
Dont
---
I had a similar experience recently. It seems like the more players, the more indestructible she is.
---
THAT is a bargain - I need to find your vending machine!
---
I said to my mate on headset....swear someone's got a camp on a water tower, nah it can't be. I should of trusted my gut and had a better look.
---
I would say so. Guess its just an opinion
---
That's a good point - does this game have bottlecap mines?  I remember those from FO3 (or was it 4?) but haven't seen the plan for those in F076... (yet?)
---
that has been de bunked several time, it is datamined that she has a health of 32000 and does not scale at all..
---
Me too buddy. I did every challenge in the game too. 3400 hrs fml
---
Speaking of which. Question. You can ‚Äúsearch‚Äù petrified corpses but they never yield anything for me. Is this just a thing?
---
:D Just swing by if you'd like. I'm afk mostly but so many folks wanted to check out I'm just spinning in my camp :)
---
ok how the fuk
---
Ok that kinda maybe explains all the people buying my ammo (I sell most of it at 1-2 caps too).  Invest in ammo because of the cap limit.. interesting.  I would have never even thought to do that haha
---
11pm here and I'm in bed lol or I would!!

I described it down below ;)
---
UK too? Cool. Have a nice evening then! :)
---
make the initial bounty equal to the players level.  That seems obvious.  Becoming wanted should either a) kick you from the team you are on or B) give your teammates the option to become wanted with you or to turn on you and disband from the team.  
---
 So far being wanted is actually being used as an exploit to grief other players and farm them for caps.  It's a little bit stupid.
---
I've been bloodied since launch and always used them for bonus rads. Never seen anything come out of them like borderlands trash yields guns sometimes. They just break into little bits and give rads
---
Yep UK, I feel like we've traded before maybe many moons ago as your name is very familiar......and  you too thanks :)
---
Eh, I guess I missed it.  But hey, at least I can buy a pile of bloody guts.
---
Yeah, that's totally possible too. Trading a lot
---
Are you sure it was the same world? I've noticed it's pretty random when it comes to whether or not it remembers your claimed workshops. The other day I server hopped about 3 or 4 times and it consistently kept all of my workshops in tact, but then the next day I tried server hopping and I lost all of them on the first attempt. 
---
I have no idea what determines it, as with a lot of things in this game. lol
---
u/CrazyOO1
---
&gt;and have ass sprayers
---
Not if you straddle it and face the tank.
---
Thank you, for reference they very much are needed sadly, if you don't get her attention she'll fly around until something, typically a mob, gets her attention. Technically you could follow her around till she lands, but other buff time limits dictate you need to get her on the floor fast meaning you'd need to be super lucky.   
---
 I think its great that this is not the ultimate and sometime someone is going to do a full natural solo 1 shot.
---
Ok well, that's unfortunate.   Thanks for this.
---
I just built my first .38 auto combat rifle last night to use up some of these .38 rounds!  (I have like 1000+) Glad to hear it's worth it because I used 2 level-ups just to get up to Gunsmith 3 to build it.  Don't know what bloodied is yet, but I see people talk about it on here all the time.
---
I‚Äôve killed the queen solo and still no challenge completion
---
I understand your pain. I've been patiently waiting for that brownish red shaggy carpet to pop back up so I can complete my 70s-inspired home. lol
---
Dont. Unless you wanna get dicked around by constant shitty customer service.
---
Have you never fought the queen? Even with the most powerful weapons you only do in the range of 1-15 damage if your perks aren‚Äôt set up properly. Queen is just a tanky lil b****.
---
read what he said, slowly. he listed all the reasons your damage is low  your "1" damage per shot is semi normal for a non-perked build, especislly on a TSE
---
Basically with bloodied weapons, adrenal reaction mutation and nerd rage. I'm doing around 180 damage with a 38 combat rifle in automatic which is enough to take out a super mutant warlord in 1 shot with a sneak critical. And 2 shots sneak critical to the torso.
---
Having problems making this play. Anyway you can post the song list?
---
turn on pacifist mode, then you won't be griefed, this is nothing new and has nothing to do with private servers.  Don't take workshops if you don't want to pvp
---
Get the spray bottle
---
BAD MR FLUFFYKINS!
---
Subscribed on day one, i mean hour one, as well as a lot of my friends, never met anybody who received it. I heard of a friend of a friend who received it but thats all.
---
No they did not
---
Bloodied sneak sniper doesn't really have any drawbacks if you ask me.  I think you should try it especially if serving up the most damage is your objective.  Or you could try being a chameleon berzerker and carry stealth boys....sneak damage and crits for the win.
---
I'm visiting tonight.   Thats pretty cool!
---
I legit put on Christmas music on Sirius this morning and was like old school Christmas music would be so dope in this game.
---
Awesome, thank you!

If you got a track list ready I can craft one up
---
But it‚Äôs the only thing that makes me special. I put that floor down on every workshop I claim.
---
Got choo
---
I get what you‚Äôre saying man, I have. FE handmade and the most I ever get is around 140-150 per shot against the queen, often times it‚Äôs under 100 though
---
but only if it is 10 dollars and an extra dollar for every month of snowing
---
Get better weapons and a better loadout.
---
My full health junkies melee character does 33 dmg per hit to her face with my faster swing combat knife. My Junkies FFR handmade does 18/19 per shot. Without drugs or alcohol.
---
TLDR; Get gud n00b!
---
I happened to share your post in a fo76 group on Facebook and turns out you are a meme now. Gratz...? I guess...?
---
And a bloodied, swing speed bagpipe.
---
Let me clear something up for you. We're discussing *possible* price of a *possible* item. Neither are confirmed, and as part of this *discussion* about the OP's request I'm telling you straight-up that $18 is a garbage price in my opinion... and I'm referencing equivalent or better content for a more reasonable price to justify that opinion through comparison. That's just being pragmatic.
---
Meanwhile all you're doing is repeatedly saying you're ok with spending that much and acting like everyone who isn't is a self-entitled whiner. You write that I'm bitching, yet I'm on reddit using it as it's meant to be used-- a platform for discussion. You just have a silly perspective because your counterargument is 'don't buy it if you don't like my price' when as I've already pointed out the object doesn't even exist at this time, nevermind at the price you're ok with. 
---
If we were talking about existing luxury cars or something similar you might have a point. But we're not. The item is only luxury in your head right now. xD
---
Thats what she said
---
Why? So that you can abandon Mr. Bigglesworth when you move your camp to another location?  Poor Mr Bigglesworth had to walk across the map for his milk bowl.
---
Skyrim Easter egg?
---
Yeah,its some asshole who is reporting it for adult material.  I've been talking to Imgur since last week and the first link I posted was auto flagged, so I just uploaded the photos to a non-linked account and tested it and it was fine to open without the adult images prompt but clearly has someone has reported the album again
---
Are you noticing missing songs? Someone else said the Kay Starr song wasn't available in the US (I'm in Canada). Are there more like that? 
---
If so I should be able to find US-friendly versions, most of these songs are pretty popular and have multiple postings on youtube.
---
I knew what to expect but I still laughed, just standing there ü§£
---
Dogs and cats plz!
---
No, because shovels are hard to come by, and I have a big porch.  Last thing I need is to be stuck shoveling my porch when a scorchbeast shows up.
---
yeah, I even uploaded it to a different account this time but someone reported the album again for adult material which imgur ( probably for good reason, auto takes each report seriously )
---
They really dont.
---
I'm on the PC and I've also been hunting for a group for the event. I recently came back to the game and I'm trying to catch up on all the content that came out since the first month of the game going live.
---
And they won't visit you when they put you in a home... something to look forward to üò≠
---
There were a couple bundles. I got the one that came with the santa costumes and a reindeer. Another was one that had an elf costume and weapon skins and if I remember there was one with a tree and lights I think.
---
I just edited a full track list with links into the original post!
---
It really is, I've been enjoying it quite a bit. If they somehow add snow to the game it'll be even better!
---
Excellent tipsüëçüëçü§ó
---
I was on my homie‚Äôs private server yesterday and got three legendaries on our Uranium Fever run.  I think that‚Äôs pretty sweet honestly.
---
65022 damage hit!!!   Good work.
---
That is weird, I notice things respawn often and have seen significantly more legendaries than when I explore public servers. Not to mention the last 10 times I have done Uranium Fever and AWOL Armaments, I have gotten at least 2 3\* enemies during the events. I'm sure the latter is just luck on my end, but the private server is a massive selling point for me because I don't like crowds or other people. I do think the box and tent should have been free content for everyone, but it is what it is unfortunately. If they had only made a Private Server only package for $5 I would have gotten that
---
Gobble gobble
---
So you had opposite, because I had this issue only with my head. I think Innov Survivalist was talking about this problem in one of her videos
---
When you repaint your walls at home, do you not take everything off the walls first?  I do.
---
Power attack or Vats strike always solves that for me
---
and on top of all that, your enter button has stopped working, what a day huh?
---
By any chance did you do a clean install of Windows on said SSD?
---
Oh I know ppl can solo it I was replying to the post that said number of ppl dont matter.
---
I find it easier with less ppl hence going in using this weapon takes 10 minutes to kill it with a group of ppl and solo taking the same about or less.
---
I'm still waiting for them to fix plasma cores
---
When you take everything off the walls, does your house suddenly have less room in it because my camp sure fucking does! It technically never leaves budget but ALSO gets added to storage. So you have one item worth double the budget
---
Im sure it was a glitch, he was just holding his guard up, Regular attacks, Power Attacks and vats were just doing nothing at all, it was pretty funny really
---
I just started using those. What‚Äôs wrong with em? Is it all the partial cores you accumulate? I just noticed it. Pretty annoying.
---
Yes it would be nice to have snow if they could figure out how not to break the game when they do so. That's why they don't add awesome things like GTA does. Rockstar has it down, Bethesda not so much.
