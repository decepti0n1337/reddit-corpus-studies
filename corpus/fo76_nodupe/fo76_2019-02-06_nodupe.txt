Good idea, but most low level players can't handle Whitesprings or Watoga.  Maybe drop in an easier location for low level players.

He destroyed it in once hit, all at once, is my guess.  (I don't mean to say he destroyed my whole camp, but he pretty much got one small building with my arch and just about everything else around it including most of my water purifiers, a junk harvester, most of my crops.)  If I said "my whole camp" I didn't mean to.   He did a massive amount of damage in one hit and got a 20 cap bounty for it.  Lame.
---
 Bethesda wants you to grind. It’s like in every updates. Look at patch notes  is very obvious. 
---
This
---
Your opinion grows weaker and can’t be taken seriously when you can’t even weigh the cons of the game and point at trees as a pro. That’s the cry of the fanboy my friend. 
---
I'm going to have to look for him I didn't even know there was a second vendor in Grafton. But then again I've passed the sulfer water fountain in Whitesprings hundreds of times and never noticed it.
---
He did a massive amount of damage and destroyed pretty much everything outside of my main building including a small 1 square building outside and water purifiers, junk extractor, most of my crops...  so no, not my whole camp but a very large portion of it.  The materials to repair the whole thing scrolled right off the screen.
---
My real point is you said "they might come in handy" is why you don't want to drop them. If you are able to scrap or sell them you would be in the same predicament, you won't have them if you scrap or sell them. I understand you can get them in events and quests, but you don't have to keep them. I agree it would be cool if we got scrap from ammo, but we don't and all but all but one one fallout game never allowed selling or scrapping ammo.
---
Without the perk it was 1, 1, 1 of the three types that it takes to make it.  I had 0, 0, 0 on hand.   Next time I will remember to just move my camp and let the movement repair itself unless Bethesda nerfs that next.
---
Don’t worry, you are only missing out on a legendary drill or flare gun. 
---
Charisma has some really good perks just for regular play. Lone wanderer, suppressor, tenderizer, and field medic are my solo line up. I don't think I could fill 15 if I had a real 15 charisma.
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Outside of a group, vendor prices are also lowered by a lot for high charisma too. That's more of a nice side effect though.
---
Hey you never know maybe if we burn it down it'll rise like a phoenix.
---
&gt; It's all about choice and sacrifice 
---
It isn't though, from level 1 to level 50, the game gives you absolutely no indication of what all the possible perk cards at your disposal will be, neither does it tell you when you'll reach the cap of maximum points in a perk until you have reached it.
---
There's no choice or sacrifice when the game doesn't tell you what your options are to begin with!
---
Unlike in other Fallout games or simply Fallout 4 (to take the closest release) where you could preview from the very start what every single perk tree could get you and that wouldn't help you choose.
---
Don't forget this "fix" was a patch to fix something that was already done before but broken again by the preceding update
---
It just works
---
I never said that lol 
---
I've had very good experiences with other players until now.   Some of them have been minimal, just wave in passing or being ignored completely, which is fine by me.   Others have been quite friendly and we drop stuff for eachother or I just drop stuff for them and take off.   
---
Yeah they are mutually exclusive. They both prevent food gains from the opposite food source. Having both would mean you couldn't restore hunger, unless there was a magical non meat non veggie food (who knows what's really in that dog food though)
---
Good good bot
---
The little dumpster area between the whitesprings employee access entrance and the road that leads to the train station has a shit ton, unless I’m misremembering whatever that plant back there gives. It’s red. Kinda looks like mothman eggs. And it just takes a bit of server hopping to find a WS nuke zone. 
---
The clubhouse has brain/glowing fungus on the basement floor in the locker rooms too. 
---
It’s vendor bot Greg 
---
It's a chore like many things in the game. There are those that enjoy the hardcore mechanic of having to find food and drink, sleeping etc but to me it's just boring. What's hardcore about finding food and drink? Why not have me wash my hands too? And shower? Clean my clothes?? The distinction between a fun, challenging experience and one of laborious chores is vast. For me the fun stops when I have to spend more time doing the chores than playing the game the way I want.

 In the Key to the Past quest I'm at the point where I take the Key fragments to her and have her put them back together, but she won't take them. Am I doing something wrong?
---
You are right, the official guide lists the broadsider as an explosive weapon, stop arguing with the trolls. Listed perks that apply are as follows : Demolition Expert and Grenadier. Now leave the morons to prove their stupidity to the world.
---
I posted this same topic on here a while ago and people told me it would be such a bad idea. Now that people seem to be on board with this it's making me salty. I guess the continued nerfing of perks has people changing their minds?
---
Whatever the reason, I really hope they do move the SPECIAL cap up, especially because it's even more necessary with the changes they've made since.
---
The best place I’ve found for lead is the weight room in the Charlestown fire department. An easy 100 or so lead
---
True. Still have to worry about environmental enemies. Definitely nice being away from griefers though. I’d much rather deal with mole rats and scorched.
---
Yeah so they get trapped inside with the only option being to break down the door once again.
---
Nope, nothing is in there. Nothing to see here. Check the... garbage cans in... Cranberry Bog. Yeah.
---
This. I have experienced this, and it's fun. Plus, a lot of the vermin like radroaches drop dead when they touch my PA, and it's certainly helpful for a melee build like mine.
---
But to the OP: don't waste your caps on plans, try to find the mods in the wild (or trade for them)! Why have the plans when all you'll ever mod with them is one or two pieces? PA mod plans are for making a business out of it, offering to mod other players' armor.
---
I can tell you at least two PA spawns that also spawn a random PA mod for whatever set is on the frame that day right next to it. Visit those regularly to get a chance at having them for free!
---
Edit: It's actually three spots, two in Watoga, one near Lewisburg Station.
---
Well I've put in a ticket to see if Support knows a fix, if they're one and the same.
---
There's about 40ish perk points per special. Currently you can have 8 in each. Making it 11 each won't be nearly as powerful as many people make it out to be. Hell in Fallout 4 you could choose unique perks till level 286. This would be nowhere near that.
---
Ur right, and I wait like 20 minutes till it loads so I can get this crap Loot to sell it for 20 caps to a robot vendor 🤣
---
Doubles or triples the effect of alcohol, which includes how much thirst it quenches.
---
I've not had that many random attacks, however I've been on the receiving end of camp destruction far too often. I have a radiation shower, and that's near impossible to repair cheaply. I loved my previous camp location near Whitespring, and for a long time no one bothered me or my camp. Then people just started being jerks. I assume their camp couldn't spawn due to mine and they were pissed. I also lock my doors so they might've been upset at that.
---
So to try and appease the arses so I redo my camp completely. Hours of work. I put my shower behind lock and key and open up the rest for use, no locked doors. Nope, that didn't solve it and the next greifing was the worst, and the last straw.
---
It was pretty obvious who did it, they were right next to my camp on the map and wanted. I was now pissed, no excuses now for why. So I went after him, snuck up, landed a hit but only thing I got was "You're a pacifist, you can't damage others."
---
Seriously? He blew up my camp, I should automatically have a freebie to obliterate him specifically. I'm melee build, and my sneak attack should have ended him in a hit or two. 
---
This made me completely moved camp, now it's less convenient for me to do what I liked to do, and takes me more time to get to WS just because of jerks and children.
---
If I'm in pacifist mode, my camp should also be untouchable. I don't want to PvP Bethesda! If this keeps happening I'll stop playing. No fun to just spend ALL MY TIME fixing my camp and FARMING for those materials over, and over, and over. That's a job, not a game, you should be paying me if I'm "on the job".
---
I've barely played since I was FORCED to move. So mission accomplished I guess. Thankfully, Anthem is releasing soon and I pre-ordered. If you don't take these kinds of things seriously, I'm done with Fallout, and your company entirely. I'm ashamed this was primarily made in Austin Texas (from what I read) because that's my home. You took what used to be an absolute love of Fallout to a disgust. I regret preordering the Tricentennial version as well, so I paid more than most to be angered and disappointed. 
---
I know this is a rant, but I have good points. I also highly doubt Bethesda will read, care, reply, or even fix it. They got their money already. 
---
And now you need to do it every time you hop servers...
---
"Hey Mister!" creepily echoes in the hallways
---
What progress? All you need are a few extractors, generators and turrets, all of which can be mostly built using the workshop materials. You don’t need anything else because the defence missions aren’t challenging and if some try to claim the workshop, just sever hop, claim the workshop again and build the 5 things you built last time. Also when you clear a workshop you get ~80% of the caps needed to claim it. 
---
I really don't have much use for flux as a T-51 user (great ballistic DR and the stock look is crusty, beat up and exactly what I enjoy), so I'll tend to hunt around after the SBQ for crimson flux to make ultracite ammo.  With super duper and ammosmith, a couple stable flux will make me easily enough ammo to last a while.  The only real time I use my pistol is against flying scorchbeasts, so the extra damage all works out.
---
Or just make a trip over to mount Blair trainyard and the nearby red rocket filling station. A possible 4 fusion core spawns, 2 on generators at the trainyard, and a possible power armor spawn at each location. Also, a chance for the battle bot event that spawns a sentry bot with a core as well. Up to five cores for two minutes of running around.
---
Do you just have to find her in the upper floors of the Whitespring? Never knew she existed
---
I think the only thing that is working is Todd Howard's crack pipe
---
Don't talk shit about my legendary berserkers rolling pin. Mrs. Claus gonna give it to ya.
---
TSE don't do shit anymore. I'm getting 1 shotted by mele all the time. Pvp is just not fun anymore like that.
---
So I'm trying to collect full sets of all types.  I get frustrated when I still have sessions where I'm trapped in a set and can't exit.  On Xbox toxicfuzzball.  
---
Yeah having a hard time finding Enclave Events for the Officer On Deck quest. Only found one after a heap of server hops...
---
That is SERIOUSLY badass!
---
Upvote. :)
---
And usually when you switch worlds it respawns but with no caps
---
I build the guitar, drums etc for anyone who wants them. I often get sent messages when people visit my CAMP and ask if I have spare plans. Sadly I’ve never had any duplicate plans but I’m always happy to build them (and anything else they like) in their CAMPs. I never ask for anything in return but a guy dropped a sweet legendary shotgun for me last night so that was awesome! I back your idea 100% as I love helping out with CAMPs
---
I literally haven't found a cap stash since the patch but I'm sure I'll forget to do this.
---
I have read 30% a lot never seen anyone say more I know for a fact it is nowhere near as effective as previous games.
---
Nice!  I forgot about that spot.  Thanks for the tip.  I haven't been there in ages.
---
It Just Works!
---
1000th like. Yea buddy fallout 76 aint dead!
---
What freaks me out, is in between loading screens I either get a black screen (so think the game may have frozen, which about 25% of the time it has), OR it loads me into the world for like 2 seconds. Enough time to aggro enemies and allow people to interact with me, THEN I get the second loading screen. 
---
So weird. 
---
Patch 5 really changed a lot of opinion from even the most hardcore of fans. The mostly positive posts turned into a lot of pissed off people and it's understandable. Despite promises of more communication we get very little. There's a lot of talk about "new content we're working on" with nothing specific mentioned and then they somehow manage to push a patch out that not only breaks more things but does so by reintroducing previously fixed bugs. The community has tolerated a lot but Bethesda have burned through all of the good faith people had.
---
I was only listing pros at that point dude, everybody and their mom is listing cons. You are so quick to nitpick things I type. I've read all the shit everyone has said, and I do agree with a lot of it. But I enjoy the pros so much that they over weigh the cons. A lot of the shit I listed was new for a Bethesda or Fallout game, not new for gaming in general. I'm an artist that works on videogame environments, and I enjoy the world of 76 very much. It's that simple.
---
That's the point, it seems to be erratic.  
---
  
---
Btw perks or no perks?
---
Really just trying to be positive. People complain about stash and budget space but they don't use there resources or rebuild/move there camp ever. So yes, while annoying, having your stuff blown up every once in a while can be beneficial 
---
You would be wrong. 
---
Wait! I wasn’t aware of this lol so he’s been speaking out against dupers for awhile now...then he gets labeled one. 
---
[removed]
---
I'm posting shots. So fucking tired of the ignorant contrarianism going on around here.
---
Someone shows up to tell you that you are wrong on anything you post in this subreddit.
---
Thank you!
---
People have been asking for this since FO4. I wonder if they'll fix it now.
---
The real loot is the friends we make along the way.
---
I want to upvoted but right now you are perfectly at 76...
---
The resources come from the workshop itself, not your stores, if the item is green when you place. A white item is consuming some of your resources. 
---
You can setup a workshop and take none of your own resources.
---
You probably equipped Martial Artist. That increases the fire rate of the Gatling Gun.
---
No perks, when I throw up my 'less hunger/thirst while in camp' perk I will basically ignore hunger/thirst for my whole build session. xD
---
That said, it also depends on what you're doing I guess. If someone is trying to keep well fed/hydrated buffs up 24/7, then maybe I could see drinking every 10 minutes.
---
Pacifist mode only means YOU can't damage other players. Not the other way around.
---
I agree w you and think pacifist should block damage taken but that's not how it works. When they open the PVP servers they should rework pacifist IMO. 
---
That north part of the map is my favorite nuke target. Massive farming at the pumpkin patch, Super Mutants with glowing masses, and the possible adventure of shooting it out with glowing ones, scorched beast, and that one really giant deathclaw all at the same time.
---
Dupers effect me in no way
---
Camden Park and Vendor Bot Greg inside Grafton!
---
Based on the last few communications from Bethesda, it sounds like they’re doing an internal review of all the weapon types. 
---
I wouldn’t expect a boost for TSE specifically, but more balancing of other weapon types, potentially making it feel less extreme in the long run. 
---
Yeah... bring back That Gun from New Vegas (and the Anti Material Rifle).
---
I think '76 is down to the "filthy casuals" and the griefers ATM.   
---
Since last Tuesday's patch the number of people online has, in general plummeted.  
---
Not hate, observation substantiated by the drop in Reddit activity and many people seeing ghost-town level friends list activity.   
---
The point?  
---
In the 4 hours I've logged in since Tuesday's patch, I have seen and experienced more griefing than in my 400+++ hours in '76 combined..  
---
.
---
He did mention taking their junk away. I could see that setting off alarms, if he picked up millions of something just to discard it a minute later.
---
Yes, give us a payout in screws/springs/ballistic fiber/nuclear materials for scrapping legendaries.  Perfect answer to the piles of shitty legendaries question.
---
Electing to be in pacifist mode means you yourself are raking away your own ability to take action in such situations just saying. That and where was your base near WS cause if its near the clubhouse I can tell you why 90% of the people in game will destroy your base everytime. Also how does it take longer to get to WS now is Ft not an option?
---
Grammy vault dweller's recipe calls for rad contaminated water. Says right there with her handwriting and you should know better than trying to fuck with grammy's recipe.

Oh I know how it's designed, just leaves those pacifist at the mercy of those who grief. Which isn't fair. I also hope those PvP servers fix it too. But I'm sure some will still go to normal servers to be jerks. 
---
Is that seriously how pacifist mode works? That’s dumb as hell. It’s literally worse that way. 
---
On the right side of the sub, there is an edit your flare option. Just select that and choose one.
---
When testing I "stood" in camp, no activity.  
---
At the end of roughly 5 minutes I could see a notice drop in the thirst meter, enough to warrant a drink.
---
I've lived at Whitesprings with no problem for quite a while now.
---
But tell me where was your house? Was it was way down south like by the pond? Was it directly behind the golf club with missile turrets taboot? Somewhere else? 
---
Put a chair outside.
---
Wow that sucks
---
Nope. 
---
Bethesda is simply tossing out bullshit in a vague attempt to support the only content they've got: the grind.
---
It can be very frustrating.  I have only had my camp attacked once because I make a point to look for out of the way areas. Only advice I can give you is to set your camp up in such away that it can be placed with relative ease in most places so you just have to play a few caps to repair everything.  Other then that people will sometimes attack people's bases. It's part of the game sadly.  
---
she is the best. sodas all around, on me!
---
I've had same problem; no XP from the assaultrons.
---
Instead we should just get a special point every 50 levels after level 50
---
Maybe the game was seeing their damage backwards?
---
Right on the more you know!
---
Yep! Totally "working as designed". Apparently those who work at Bethesda never played online games before. Griefing of pretty common and should be a large concern in the initial design of any game. 
---
Yes. Two days ago I got some junk and two legendary weapons from the Cigarette Machine at Watoga. That was awesome. 
---
I always dump Plans, Armor, Junk, Weapons and Chems at Vault 76. For any newbies stepping out of the vault or higher levels that fast travel there. 
---
Thanks.  Found it a little while ago. Was using a different app so it didn't have the option 
---
Face it, they're turning this game into Fortnight, whether the players like it or not.
---
Was the non legendary crafted at 200%?  If that's the case, then it'll do a little more damage then a bat at 100% repair.
---
Did you also check, by equipping the bat after you checked the non-legendary?
---
Yup legendary effects and weapons need a lot of rebalancing sadly.
---
Interesting. So — hypothetically we have to scenarios lol. He’s a liar and a cheater. Or he’s been telling the truth. Hunting dupers, calling out bugs, and trying to improve the game. He’s either a Fallout villain or a Fallout unsung hero lmfao. Might make for some good role play if he gets his account back. 
---
I don't know about you but I'd rather not turn around from repairing my weapon to see someone standing there, in my room, menacingly, at night, with red eyes.
---
Wait, that gives me an idea...
---
I am calling shenanigans. I play frequently, have a 75, 42, an 35 character I take 2 and 3 workstations whenever I am on. Only 1 time has anyone ever even tried pvp with me. I might see 2 or 3 wanted on the map for small amounts. I am on xbox which I have been told is a gutter, I don't get what it is that invokes such ire about you, but it ain't being unlucky.
---
One thing you will learn as you get older. Just because people don't like something doesn't mean it is bad. And just because people like something doesn't mean it is good. 
---
You can't pet them that hard. Be gentle.
---
That would make sense. No one bothered me for months, this had just been in the last few weeks. 
---
I just leave mine open to anyone that needs to use my workbenches or needs a bed or water. The only thing locked is the generator room.
---
The bad thing about being rude on the internet, is that it stays there I can come back and reflect on it.  I just wanted to let you know I was sorry.
---
An even cheaper way of getting fusion cores is just to claim a power plant. There are 3 on the map, and if they're all taken it is easy to server hop. There is pretty much zero reason to fight somebody for fusion cores.
---
You have to scrap bulked items
---
I am so confused by this only because it's like 2050 when the nukes hit and they're acting like it's the 1950's.
---
I get the balance choice, rat poison has 5 lead in it, but you'd think their society would've wisened up to ecological dangers, instead of going on nuclear scientific crusades.
---
I don't mind level 50 being the cap. 
---
I do mind \~20 levels being 'tax' levels rather than progress levels. My build is one family of weapon damage perks, a couple mutation and charisma perks, and then in the realm of 15-20 spent on increased durability / lower weight / picklock / etc
---
Worse part is waiting 3 min for a 3star to load its loot only to find.......nothing. 
---
That would be a ridiculously strong character.  I'm totally ok with the 57 point system.  An extra 26 points would be cool IF they could only be devoted to non-combat related perks, like weight reduction, hacking, lockpicking, crafting and food production.
---
If that's a lot to you then you really don't want to see my inventory... A hot mess
---
Tfw there's only one automatic pistol that can't become a rifle. The good ol'trusty 10MM, but yeah pistols can definitely use more variation. 
---
maybe some day
---
And reinforcing my point, your post was downvoted, even with a legit gripe :(
---
I believe it is the dirty tan suit and bower hat. Not the "bowler hat" this doesn't count any more go figure, try the one that just has bower ... since the patch bowler hat no longer works supposedly. 
---
I leave everything accessible, but lock all but one water purifier and all resource 
---
Pretty much yeah, you actually get used to it after a few years on social media in general, always gonna be someone who needs to be right no matter what.
---
Ok. So when you are in the shop area downstairs, go into the little cafe area where there’s no vendor bot and go up the stairs. 
---
Open door and go directly to your right all the way til you hit the floor length window. 
---
Turn right then take your first left. 
---
Bubbles. 
---
Yes, Empath sucks unless you are on a team with other Empaths. It says +33% damage, but the way DR works it is more like +300% damage.
---
On the contrary, when you get to a full team of 4 with Empath plus Strange in Numbers x4, you become unkillable, even while naked.
---
If you play solo, or not in a team with other Empaths, then remove it fast. It is by far the worst mutation.
---
And Camp McClintock.
---
The game won't say the true bloodied damage until you actually equip the item.  Then it'll caculate damage based on your health.
---
Bonkers
---
It was between the golf house and where the abandoned outdoor shops are, ie the Christmas room. I was next to that river to get purified water. 
---
This might be way off but I wonder if things randomly up and dying is related to the random take-damage noise and reaction we get as players? I've seen almost everything drop dead like this since playing from launch. 
---
I wish defenses actually helped in any way. Even the high level turrets are useless against players, unless they’re totally incompetent.
---
They make it way too easy to destroy someone’s base. At least let out defenses put up a good fight
---
so you messed up yourself and its the games fault? weird..
---
For consoles, they can't just drop an update any time they want, they have to go through a process with the respective services (Xbox Live, PSN).  They can do some hotfixes through an expedited method, but generally not.
---
PCs they could drop any time, which is why updates usually drop a couple days earlier on those.  But they have to keep the same general schedule as consoles to keep the builds uniform.
---
Aww thanks man gonna get me some Nuka Grape!
---
Wait, Furious is weaker than post-nerf TSEs? Seriously? What sort of BS is this?
---
Yeah, no.
---
You can sell me ammo
---
Yeah i'm a little shocked. I'm basically here to learn about farming spots and maybe make friends.  Didn't think such an innocuous comment would upset someone.
---
I mean if the guy was making the point that most games run on UDP - of course, but when it comes to data storage its usually APIs - because you want CRC checks, and tokenization/security, and all that jazz so the business logic for RND on things resides in your cloud... 
---
But I digress, I have to pay another 10 bucks for 100 megs of data i went over on my dual ISDN.
---
Did I just see you on PC? last part of IGN 65? by the twin lakes?
---
The defensive perks are next to worthless when compared to combat armor or pa, half the defensive perks aren't even compatible with pa, and a third of my perk points go into weight reduction
---
To date, I’ve had a regular plasma Gatling, a tse lever and just a couple days ago, my regular old 50 cal, all go missing. Fist time I thought I had dropped/sold it by mistake. After that I made sure I was careful. Had the tse lever go missing between fast travels. Was in inventory, fast traveled and it was gone. 
---
Yeah I noticed that... Lovely. 
---
Face facts, they have absolutely zero interest in fixing this dumpster fire of a game.
---
I agree, level cap is fine. If anything, I expect to be able to get some new perks that make it more interesting. Should we be able to trade perk cards?
---
ahhh yes this actually happened to me while i was looting a legendary i defeated..i got up to his legendary armor which i got..the POOF!!! vanished..good thing i looted it in time
---
[Here's a vid if you need it just in case] (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6-Y_O2olLCY)
---
if i could decorate the walls of my camp with bloody switchblades that would make up for it but lining the shelves with paper bags makes it look like i live at a homeless shelter... so yeah i'll settle for fixing the economy.
---
Mine wasnt that nice. 
---
My team were holding a workshop for the mat extractors we had. We were all in the level 30 range. Some clown was stealth and using 2 shot explosive shotty on us (this is pre patch mind you)  
---
If you want to know what Bethesda thinks of pay to win and loot boxes then I'd direct your attention to the "Concerned Mother" holotape in the principal's office of Watoga High School.  I know a lot has been data mined to support it, but they TOLD us what their plan was right in game.
---
I would avoid that as anyone seeing that base near there will destroy that I myself have destroyed many a base near the clubhouse it's not that there's more griefers building there causes more issues for the people who farm there and they instantly think the worst of ppl built near there and its a super high traffic area.
---
That's my practice now after all this sadly. So far my new place is quiet. I hope it stays that way. 
---
using this I have never had less then 500 diluted stims and rad away at any given time.
---
Hey, thats why sals grinders !&gt;lost the sandwich war.&lt;!
---
That would be nice.  I bought a paint job since it puts the atom mark next to the name, but unless you have deployed it it does not show, like in the stash.  Come on work with me here Bethesda.
---
I pay it forward all the time now to repay the time, as a lowly level eight, I found the plans for the small letters in the overseer's stash in the Flatwoods church. 
---
This was one of my top three joys in this game. I was sooo happy to get that.
---
yea you can only ever have one in your inventory at a time once you receive that mission that youtube video or wiki is BS 
---
I disagree. I think your idea is atrocious and would ruin the game.
---
You have to pick two up, on the one server. If you log out or DC, you will only get count for one doc
---
It will say it has only one doc in your inventory
---
But in hand in, you will get 40caps instead of 25
---
I Have the perk for crafting melee weapons/perks, rank 4... Is this the one you mean? Could be the explanation! And no, stupid me didnt check that, just shut the machine off, Its 1.30 am over here. I will look into this tomorrow! Thanks for your idea mate :)
---
Nope, it's not.
---
More likely he was a douche to someone and they friended him and now hunt him whenever he is online.
---
And I agree you shouldn't have to waste caps but thats a very high profile and dangerous area.
---
OMG I can't wait, mods to turn everything into huge anime tittie gurls. On a serious note I'm gonna load that fucker up with so many NPC enemy's.
---
One word: straightjackets
---
Will be interesting if he wasn't a duper and griefing them cause a false positive 
---
Ok so, I did one last round the next day to sell junk to hoard caps...to have some if the game "came back around". I precipitously in one WS Nuke run picked up a 3* Bloodied Assault Rifle, 3* Instigating Machete, and 3* Executioners Power Fist.  Next day following received a PM from a Redditor who believed the nerf would be reversed eventually, who would trade me a full set of 2 and 3* Unyeilding Combat Armor for my now pitiful TSE Handmade.  I love this game again.
---
I shouldn’t have to use a third party website to get a code let me do it in game. What about people on consoles they have to use a whole separate device to look it up. 
---
Get lock picking 2 or higher (or bring a friend who has it or the key) before going to explore the Mothman museum. To get to the Mothman cult's church in the basement you need to pick the lock to the bathroom.
---
Had it happen with an automatic tesla rifle and an explosive pipe rifle.  Super annoying.  That's largely why I started up a melee alt last friday.
---
The same vendor should have it if you bought it, if it was RNG then you'll probably never see it as it's likely less then a 1% drop.
---
Tricentennial formal suit and formal hat work for this 
---
Nope, Battlefield. But I get your point 😀
---
I'd love to see a system like the legendary scrapping mod in Fallout 4, where you can get a legendary effect chip that can be used to make a legendary, but you would need to get the recipe to each legendary effect, and the better ones cost more chips and such.
---
But even just getting some springs and screws and such would be better than nothing.
---
Aside from him messing up, launch a nuke is tedious, not fun, and the time to reward ratio is meh and I have run dozens of Queen and WS runs. 
---
I haven't been near the game in weeks and I logged on today and exited my power armor to craft ammo and I was expecting to h
---
Yeah, np!  The perk you're referring to is makeshift warrior, it keeps melee weapons from breaking fast and allowing you to craft higher level mods.  The perk I was referring to was weapon artisan.  It allows you to repair weapons to 200%.
---
Lol at moving over to anthem...
---
Why didn't you just drop something? Surely it wasn't ALL invaluable. At the very least, there had to be something worth loosing to fight the queen.
---
I hear your paint. If I hadn't watched 1 or 2 walkthrough videos beforehand I would have been lost and probably only gone in with one keycard. As it was, both solo attempts resulted in me not having the ability to repair the mainframe cores (it wasn't and option under Quest Items). So, I had to go find all 15 of them throughout the facility and it was quite tedious. Also, on my first run, I had to 'pause' the game for a moment to go do something and I jumped into a hiding place next to a console in one of the rooms. When I came back I found out I was stuck in the geometry between the console and a wheelchair. Even with Marsupial it wouldn't let me move or jump out of the spot I was in. This had happened once before right next to the Morgantown Train Station. Anyway, I had checked ahead of time and the code had already been solved so I knew which one to use.
---
Once I launched the nuke and headed down to fight the SBQ, someone invited me to join their team and I was like Why Not? I'm glad I did because I got booted from the game 2 or 3 times and each time I was able to rejoin due to being on a team. We didn't manage to take out the queen but it was a good fight.
---
I would try launching a nuke again but probably on a team next time.
---
Whitesprings in all honesty is a bad place to  build anyway.  If the ghouls dont wreck your base a nuke or people will. Where did you have it set up if I may ask?
---
Ok then I will cut you a little slack then. You are in a unique position and have a unique perspective, sadly most people who purchase the game are fans of video games and all its aspects so that’s how they will judge the game. Not just the art of the environment. So all I ask is, just for one moment, imagine you were just a giant Fallout fan who fell for the hype then didn’t get the game they expected. 
---
Honestly. I cant be bothered to complain about this stuff. I just want monsters to not be healed when I shoot them and for old bugs that were "fixed" to not come back.
---
Or Thursday is the new norm.
---
What about feverclaw? I got no idea where to get that
---
It's a bug since the last patch. Really sucks, if you're on a good server and this happens, you have to relog to fix it.
---
Gotta remember it took a long time for the division to reach that stage and their player base tanked as hard as fallout 76 but came back strong.
---
If only someone would draw dog meat in front of a can labeled...need canned dog food.
---
They'll nerf melee. Mark my words. How else can they force people to buy pay-to-win ~~lootboxes~~ lunchboxes?
---
I use rule of thumb 5 for diluted rad x and rad away and so on 
---
Lol, i needed to rant.
---
I own the Old Possum sign from the Atoms store, but was unable to build it for a friend's camp. I suppose that's how Bethesda makes sure you spend Atoms.
---
I would love, however, to randomly team with folks then travel to their camps to make them more attractive. I'd even be willing to use my own scrap to do it. There are so many drab, empty camps in 76. :(
---
Didn't work for me, tried that on a forbidden knowledge run, no change to the list in challenges. Thanks though. You would think a Tuxedo would be about as formal as it gets but even those didn't work, their listed as "semi-formal wear". kek
---
If anything, they'll nerf them more. 
---
My guess is that it uses the Casual Under armour linings. Not got anything to confirm that though I'm afraid.
---
It's incredible that they didn't just rollback the last patch and instead just left us with more bugs
---
I always find canned dog meat. But i can draw it later. I am no professional hah
---
Meh, just drop what you don't need.
---
Invalid reason, at this point it's YOU lot whom are complaining for the sake of complaining.
---
Looks great man!
---
What I don't get is why the Starlet Sniper outfit works for the level up but not the complete quests/events
---
Look under lighting?
---
I don't, sorry :(
---
I feel like it was either Line in the Sand or Surface-to-Air, but I'm spitballing
---
Haha thanks! Didn't want to shitpost in the traditional way, as i still play daily. The grind is real. Hah
---
I know you're joking but lore wise one of the holotapes she leaves says something about how she is disappointed everyone is running around nuking the place to hell and back. Although that doesn't really make sense when one of the goals of the endgame is to 'seal' fissure prime by nuking it (which it would seem has no effect because you can just nuke it again to cause the SBQ to spawn again).
---
dropping it feels bad. that's really the issue i think.
---
There are some good tips already. The main things I look for are assault rifles from super mutants at West Tek. They sell for 25 - 40 for me depending on condition. Pipe weapons aren't worth selling but scrap for a lot of steel. If you're looking for best weight-to-cap ratio then aside from what's been mentioned I used to go to Fort Defiance and loot all the Straight Jackets. With my low charisma and hard bargain 3 I could get roughly 49 per jacket and they only weigh 0.1 too. Unfortunately, you can run through and find none or you can run through and find 15+. It depends on who has been there recently.
---
Totally agree with you and think it goes even further than just Enclave Events. 
---
ALL quest rewards need an overhaul. 
---
I’m just about to put this game to bed after reaching level 127 and having zero fun or incentive to play. 
---
Where do you live that servers don't crash constantly?
---
Yup my bad. I am going to delete the post so I don’t cause anyone miss info!
---
What? Two-shot 25% damage, and even if the 30% cap is true that's still higher dmg output. It also doesn't mess with accuracy, and would easily stack on the queen.
---
Don't you know if you are starving you can't fast travel? I had to eacape by losings lots of stuff and ending myself.
---
The plan you are looking for is called Modern Paintings and I am almost positive you can get it from Studio 58 in the White Springs Resort. I made one of the cat paintings for my camp and I'm about 98% certain that's where I bought them.
---
The only good bug end up getting taken away. Would be terrible
---
My luck seems to involve me only getting legendary wood armour or useless melee weapons like lead pipes or war drums. With the right perks those might be good but nocturnal, bloodied, hunter etc are of no use to me.
---
One thing you apparently aren't old enough to understand *yet*, is that while your statement does bear some truth to it, it is not absolutely intrinsically true for every circumstance.
---
Objectively, the vast majority of people do not enjoy the taste of feces because it is BAD.
---
When the overwhelming majority of people do not like something? That means it is probably objectively bad. Does that mean it cannot still bring some enjoyment? No. Some people still eat shit, literally. Some people enjoy fecal play during sexual interactions. That doesn't mean shit objectively tastes good - it just means some people have shitty taste.
---
Well yeah, you know, either way - both are lifesavers :D
---
$10 from gamestop?! More like 10 cents. 
---
Selling any mutation for 150 caps...this guy is scamming lol...I will make and sell t-51b calibrated shocks for 500 each of not lower.
---
Your observations are spot on. I have not seen this many wanted players since the game launched. 
---
lol
---
They best is when your fighting the queen and enemies start falling out of the sky and dieing on impact.
---
&gt; Min-maxing should be an option for hardcore folks who enjoy tweaking their builds. It shouldn't be a requirement to even play. 
---
That's my biggest issue with the game. I'm old and tired from working all day. I want to game to have fun, not to stress out about min-maxing my build.
---
Cap on industrial is 5
---
If you have one turn it in dont pick anymore up. If you find one befor turning one in remember where it was and go back right after you turn the other one in. This is how I got most of the rare outfits from the quest
---
It's almost like people have different opinions.
---
&gt; repair costs
---
Durability is the problem, not repair costs. Even with repair costs lowered, guns break too fast and you have to fast travel back to a workshop to repair them. That's not fun!
---
You mean the western revolver?... I agree there are too few though. Deliver weapon model from 4 would be a quick add I’m sure.
---
cool dude so why don't you make a post of you're own instead of coming here
---
They did it to themselves then punished their customers for their incompetence...
---
Your main post is 330 words. Your TL;DR is 122. I was making a lighthearted joke, but you're the one that doesn't seem to understand that a TL;DR that is 1/3 as long as the post is not an effective summary.
---
Hm okay... I didnt get artisan so far.. So could it be that bloodied weapons have a slightly lower base damage? Because even if they only show their real damage when equipped, it otherwise shouldnt be lower then on the regular weapon.
---
I don't care about them speaking or emailing or sending out weekly newsletters. Just fix the game, give us a time line and let us know when something alters the time line.
---
Alright alright...it ain’t a scam...but you could lower it further since almost every respectable player sells mutations for 100-150 and the same for shocks.
---
I love how throughout this thread you're talking like it's not you.
---
I used to actually invest more in END when All Night Long worked persistently instead of just half the time.  It was one of the more helpful perks for someone with Speed Demon mutation.  After they "fixed" it, I dumped speed demon and all night long, put 2 of my extra END perk points into AG and picked up 2 ranks of gun runner.  I equip my backup pistol (melee build with a minor in pistols for the few times I need to shoot, bc people toss .44 ammo and quality legendary pistols all the time as junk, plus the extra AG is good for AP and not running out of gas immediately while overburdened) when I want to move much faster and I don't have the constant need to eat and drink like I did with speed demon.  It's also useful for clearing really long gaps with marsupial.  I think the +20% movement is just shy of actually sprinting everywhere.
---
I was under the impression that events were triggered by passing players.
---
Less people playing, or more higher level players staying in difficult areas means the first events won't be triggered as often.
---
i play in a group all the time, and rarely have an issue. Games been fairly stable for me, I have a pretty good internet connection.
---
The only reason I cod think for that.  Would have to be that one is lower level than the other.
---
Ratty suit and a bowler. King of a little scrap of dirt? 
---
Later became the king of hell?
---
I've yet to see a near empty server.
---
Yep. The problem is it is a popular spot because of the quest line, so you have to have some degree of luck
---
wow, not only did they absolutely saturate it with the HDR but they got rid of all the graffiti... why do people do this to pictures? those 2 pictures might as well be 2 completely different areas with how different they look, and they both look cool but i'd rather see the real thing than what is basically a CGI mockup of what the photographer would rather the scene look like...
---
The enemy health regen bug that was previously fixed for explosive/energy weapons needs to be fixed again ASAP.
---
The constantly scrolling trade/loot bars need to stop at 1 again.
---
If they could fix those two things, that would be a massive QoL improvement.
---
Not everyone nukes the fissure sites all the time. That's the point of the holotape.
---
?? u should try market76 people are selling mutations for 300+ and shocks for 1k+. and i never claimed to be a respectable player quite frankly i don't care what people think about what im selling. its simple you don't like my prices don't buy.
---
Amen to the last bit.  It's not that Junk doesn't come with overhead (as evidence by the lag caused when rapidly bulking), but I bet the database moves much faster if even half the playerbase moves weapon/armor/ammo/chem caches into dedicated containers.
---
Can I just say that the thought of dropping an item into a global container with the intention of giving it to my alt is mind-blowing?  If you have a friend around to help with the transfer, then I guess you can use that same friend to guarantee that your alt logs into the same server from which to get the loot... unless you're saying that items you store in a container on one server will follow you?  No way! ... way?
---
If so, that is truly shocking.  It hasn't happened often, but there have been a few occasions where I would find something like a toolbox that only contains wrenches, and so I didn't loot it.  Next day in the same area, other containers were still empty due to the reset timer, but that toolbox had different loot.  So I've been assuming that each server's loot table is disconnected.  If you can use those containers to transfer items... :-o
---
Good and bad are always subjective. Move on.
---
I have everything unlocked, including two industrial water purifiers and all the adhesive crops, plus melons, gourds and blackberries. I've made a couple of signs telling people to help themselves to free purified water and crops and also another note telling people to look up the recipe for adhesive online. 
---
I'm in a heavily trafficked area.
---
Every time I come home the crops remain unpicked and the purifiers full of water waiting for me. 
---
I'm always kind of sad about it, tbh.
---
I found her once, then never again.
---
300 hours is an insane amount of time... that's almost 4 hours a day every single day since release.
---
Have never experienced this. If possible I’d love to know too as I’ve been doing this wrong and paying WAY too much for my mods. 
---
Taking their workshop and then when they come to defend it killing them and taking all their junk then server hopping 
---
This trend of people accusing others of duping with 0 evidence is becoming very tiring. 
---
Honestly they should have reported the dupers..
---
Taking their stuff will have landed them in bother by the sheer quantity picked up.
---
And i bet if they sold any of it. That'll net them marked as a duper too.
---
Be interesting to see the outcome. Oh and that reply they got from Bethesda, that's an automated bot for sure, not a human reply. 
---
That's not a bad idea
---
I wandered into someone's camp the other day and picked up a bounty (not sure what I did). I would have messaged the owner to apologize and ask to be killed but i did not know how. So, how exactly does one go about doing that?
---
Holy F***, that awesome to see, I follow a few of the explorers on YT but never have I seen this.
---
Well, I'm no developer but hotfixes should be frequent, at least twice a week for PC since they're faster to implement.  The game feels abandoned without them, or it feels like there's only a couple of dev working on them.
---
Thanks. I just feel like it would add a layer for real pvp the game needs.
---
There are so many ways a solo nuke launch can potentially go wrong, including but not limited to:
---
* Not bringing water and food (although you do find some in the silo)
---
* Not bringing enough ammo / weapons (in case you run out of ammo or your weapon breaks)
---
* Not bringing / wearing the right gear or Power Armor in full-health condition
---
* Not having the right build to be able to survive the onslaught of robots and turrets
---
* Not having enough perk points in picklocking or hacking
---
* Not bringing enough materials to repair the mainframe cores
---
* Not bringing enough keycards
---
* Not knowing ahead of time which launch codes to try
---
* Getting 'stuck' in the geometry (this happened to me and I had to exit the game and start over)
---
* The game glitches and won't give you the option to repair the mainframe cores (this happened to me twice)
---
* Server disconnects
---
TL;DR - Know before you go^TM
---
fight for fun
---
I would even be happy with a patch every.....fortnite.  
---
dude are you kidding me you obviously never played them during the launches. neither do the 6 people who upvoted you

I know! What purpose does 234 missiles serve? Absolutely nothing I agree with this post
---
Ps4 - haven't had any trouble logging in since launch. One of the few things that always works.
---
I would say except most misc items. Like we should be able to sell ores
---
That's why when I leveled I carried two guns that used different ammo.  While I ran down low on one type I'd use something that shot another type then switch back.  Pick up one perk for shotgun so it's worthwhile and you can use that as well.
---
Hell, as this is a Bethesda run sub this community is essentially playtesting and QA’ing so it would make sense to weaponise that in a proactive way. The long speeches are great but the best posts are where people have crowdsourced the common issues. 
---
That sort of detail is, I imagine, potentially overwhelming but there are people here who would happily build a spreadsheet  with all the things. Bethesda would just need to add the status. 
---
Also; would settle the debate on whether you should be able to see the reticule on a scope when chameleon’d.  
---
It kills level 1 Radroaches with out me even noticing.
---
I like to spray the chrome directly in my mouth just like the real war boys
---
Reminds me of the idea I was pitching to
---
Several communities about 5 years ago after all my experiences in different games with harassing griefers mis using the pvp options that kept getting put in thoughtlessly by different game makers - they would do this in order to be gankers and trouble makers for players who weren’t trying to be competitive. The name of the system was outlaws vs vigilantes.
---
See, the established politics didn’t have an infrastructure for dealing with the threats of the outlaws so it’s up to the vigilantes to decide to take them on. The core mechanic there being that even in a setting with politics in the plot forcing your character to be in one Side or the other you had to choose which group you actually helped or opposed, and whichever one you choose has a path of gaining karma in that group and acquiring the spoils of completing their objectives about defeating / reducing the other side. 
---
In Appalachia it makes sense that any player can decide to wreck a camp, and the consequence can only be other players reacting. There is no established force anywhere. Everyone is dead at this moment in the simulation. 
---
Thematically it fit to those who wanna defend to noobs and those who want to gank (and with 76- CAMP wreck) them. 
---
try Explore With Us on YT, many places they visit in the vids I'm adding up scrap in.
---
I believe its random drops now
---
yes please!
---
Once you get your endgame weapons you'll be swimming in springs.  I bulk and sell them now and they go for a LOT if you use Hard Bargain, a Mothman Egg Omelette (or some other Charisma boosting food) and a Grape Mentat.
---
Not really while they are being a ass about it they are right. A casual player isn't going to be the best person to ask about balancing issues. Because its online you need to keep the game balanced. Forcing you to specialize is kind of the point of survival games to force cooperation between a group of specialists to prosper and not just survive. Unfortunately this game is to busy trying to appease everyone it both fails at being a survival game or a casual fun exploration shootwr. 
---
Huh...she must be really peeved at how often Whitesprings gets nuked.
---
I can't play the game because it literally won't even launch for me in fullscreen mode since the patch, and window mode is still unplayably laggy.
---
My mission points to Abbies bunker and thinkers workbenxg. I'm missing the uplink though 
---
A patch to make the game more enjoyable?
---
Good joke. 10/10, would tell again.
---
i am pretty sure Fallout's general aesthetic is more firmly rooted in the 50's, the entire decade. just look at these two screenshots of 50's and 60's aesthetic and decide which one "feels" like Fallout
---

---
[1950's aesthetic](https://puu.sh/CHS2o/fd4678a949.jpg)
---
[1960's aesthetic](https://puu.sh/CHS7n/7daceff4a4.jpg)
---
granted there is less design and architecture aesthetic to see in the 60's screenshot but you can still get a general feel for the aesthetic of the era

Plague Walker, the premier mutation for homeless wasteland prostitutes.  Buy it today for 4000 caps!

It is kinda cool for nukes, but otherwise terrible.  Especially if you have an instigating weapon.  Electrically charged is similarly bad.

Be sure to check the containers down there, have found decent plans (small numbers/letters etc)
---
iv been waiting since the 23rd . nothing . might as well pick up another game like the rest of us. its gonna be a while 
---
Apparently there’s a perk that does it. Some guy just posted earlier about it, dunno the perkname. 
---
It doesn't work in there?
---
Whether it's good or bad is irrelevant. The point is it was very poorly received and also apparently didn't sell very well. That's all the qualifications you need for something to be a 'disaster'. 
---
Weapon artisan repairing it to over 100% adds some damage for melee. That should give you the expected results. Also check your hp and adrenal reaction, this is also true with bloodied, nerd rage, and unyielding armor pieces which increase the damage amount you’re gonna see whole your hp is low triggering the bonuses
---
1 trip through Whitespring checking garbage's and closets was a 5 purified water run with all the right perks on, hate to think what it is without any perks, only 1 can of dogfood though, I thing it;s a bug really.
---
Yeah, what kind of disease was running through vault 76, anyway? Last I checked, a normal human could go up to three days before dying of thirst, yet my character needs to shotgun a gallon of water every thirty minutes or they fall over dead.

Do you have rad worms? Seems to be having interesting side affects like increasing mutation and effects by 50%. Positive and negative.

Random power armor pieces get unequipped.  Every. Fucking.  Time.  I equip my pa. Today it's the left leg.

Lately (since last patch]  my rifle gets removed from the favorites wheel,  often several times during an evening of play.  Random pieces of my armor aren't available to mod at the armor station.  Turrets do not attack animals.

It only effects enemies. Enclave bots aren't agro unless provoked

So they're already rushing out patches every other week that end up buggy... and you'd expect the quality of the patches to go UP if they rushed them even more and started pushing them out every single week?
---
And you're not grasping by what I meant when i said LITERALLY reworked from the ground up, FFXIV's maps were so bad they had to trash the entire world and rebuild it from the ground up.  The changes resulted in an entirely new game in essentially every single aspect, the kind of changes you couldn't just patch into a game week after week until you had a new finished product.  The changes Bethesda has been making and needs to make to this game are NOWHERE near extreme enough to merit taking the servers down.

Combat or deliberate choice to avoid / avert it, something most video games have been presenting us with for a long time, with the simulation of battle for visceral primal value. 
---
There ya go and Feel free to come up with any more reasons you can think of, knock uitself out if it makes u happy
---
They are. Arguing that is ridiculous.
---
I've gotten this reflex down so thoroughly that I always end up doing a little jump after searching containers. On the PS4, the button you press to search containers is the same as for jumping. So I have a little scavving hop I do with almost every container. It makes me giggle.
---
I'm okay with electrically charged and unstable since I generally get the first hit in anyways 
---
Somewhere a modder will have started working on this(not me) and will be on Nexus in a week likely.
---
Damn agree
---
No. I was not able to. Make it an atom shop item and not transferable or sell able with mod on
---
Not unless they own the skin I believe less someone found a work around like with the power armor paint.
---
Agreed. Thank you for your insight I’m glad someone took the time to read the post - if I had cheated I wouldn’t even bother posting this, but yeah it sucks to be auto banned then abused by the “community” for something I didn’t even do. But they’re super quick to defend Bugthesda as if all they speak is the truth LOL😂
---
Because Bethesda 
---
Not on PC. It's likely via a console's social system.
---
The enclave event where it drops a supply pod at berkley springs always gives me a plasma rifle. Idk if that event happens anywhere else
---
Theres nothing left to do for alot of endgame players. So getting wanted or killing players is all thats left. 
---
I agree with you that my question should had been open ended and less specific! 
---
Well the is still broken since the the last patch for me, would be nice if they could fix that at least.
---
Yeah she say hello to my new best friend, ME, when death got nerfed of
---
It’s rad curing (a nice buff for those who are hooked on the low hp boosted playstyle)
---
I thought women were hard to understand.  
---
Then I joined Reddit.  
---
Usually events like awol, one violent, uranium fever.
---
And when she goes you like nuka cola OF COURSE U DO it’s so adorable I cry radiated man tears
---
Don't worry, nothing if going to happen. That's the scam charity that donated 1.5m out of the 105m they received in 2010 I think it was. Most of that 1.5 went to PETA and other radical groupsbwith the change the do donate. Now if you called the SPCA heads would roll. That is the charity that spades and nutets pets and does so much other good. ASPCA is really bad, they run the ads on TV that make kids cry and then get rich but tricking folks. They made their name to trick kind folks. Sorry, my soap box
---
Recently I've only encountered the bug where periodically the enemy appears invincible the first few melee hits and then they start to take damage.
---
I like the entrance directly
---
To her counter. I just jump up and over the part of the building in my way when I fast travel
---
To Whitesprings service entrance, and there are 5 or so
---
Doors in a rounded half circle pattern is how you know it’s that entrance 
---
Maybe fat Tuesday event? 
---
Add me , same ign as reddit name.
---
I’ll protect u bud
---
Sometime I get so many legendary items from whitesprings that I have to leave them on the ground cuz I can barely walk
---
Granny, what ever happened to my father, he said  he went out to get a Stupak and never came back😕
---
That’s so frustrating - what a waste!!! Rip to so much of their dwindling fanbase
---
Not enough clipboards.
---
Not sad at all, that is not an endgame item by any stretch
---
I'm assuming bethesda needs the time to read player inventory to identify dupers?
---
Lvl 5 assassin ripper! 
---
No its cosmetic only because they are still available in game without the store.
---
I don't wear PA and my carrying cap is 295, just use the travelling pharmacy perk and that's it. Especially now that it is fixed and all the proper reductions are applied.
---
This^ people just want a reason to rage.
---
Just toss them.  Don't be a hoarder.  Unless you're playing an explosives build, there's no reason to hang on to that stuff.  Some of my friends always complain about being over encumbered, then when I get a nice legendary they like I trade it to them for free, get a peek at their inventory and see that they're carrying 100+ cans of dog food and 3000 .38 rounds.  You don't need that stuff!  Dog food is worth 1 cap.  I love me some dog food, but I cap myself off at 20 cans.  That's more than enough for anyone to eat.
---
It would be kinda nice to yield some extra lead, steel and possibly nuclear material from scrapping ammo, but the question must be asked as to why you picked it up in the first place.  My sniper uses .308 and 5.56 ammo, so that's what I pick up.  My melee kinda uses .44 ammo, so I pick them up when I see them and toss anything in excess of 1000 rounds.  
---
Given that each vendor has only 200 caps, you could easily fast travel to them empty handed, kill all enemies present and loot everything on their bodies, equip Hard Bargain 3 and clear them all out without much issue every day.  My sniper has traveling pharmacy 3, so he collects chems for bartering.  My melee has thru-hiker 3, so he focuses on stable foods.  Raw gold, silver, ultracite and fiberglass is also very light and valuable.  Asbestos is super common and sells for 1 cap a unit to make up the last cap if you're that frugal.  Cigarette packs and coffee pots are everywhere.
---
I mean, they're well known for taking people's pets by force an euthanizing them amongst other things. Just saying.
---
Pay for a difference of maybe 1 shot of damage? Thats not win. Also they are in game as well.
---
Martial artist increases the fire rate. Since Gatling guns are cranked and it's the only gun it does this to I think it's a feature and not a bug
---
Nice man thanks, but I think until they fix certain bugs like Loot not loading I will not waste my time and resources on the queen, but thanks though 
---
I with you there, xb1 everytime I log in there are 24 players on the server.
---
So they could put some cosmetic TSE's on the shop, since you can get them in the game without the store...
---
Yeah for some reason I’m not getting any bites no matter how much I post that we need modding straight to ui and also a sky the limit creation club situation to rival how we used to play team
---
Fortress or unreal tournament. Ghost town. No one is chiming in
---
It is, if the environment damages it, that's ok, my bad or just luck. I've camped that spot for months and the worse thing was camp couldn't be placed. 
---
We need heroes in light of the prevalent villainous activities, add me(ign same as reddit) on PC thoo
---
I’ll come kill the wanted players, but best to just quickly move camps asap once they start attacking.  
---
Ahh, right, didn't think of that. Shame this game wasn't on steam, would've at least been able to communicate with people that way. Granted I've seen added it to steam to communicate with friends that way.
---
It’s a cranking motion, so it makes sense lol
---
&gt; Edit I had changed worlds in the follow up test, curious if it's Server instance related, and I remember seeing a post the other day about the time scale seeming off and day and night happening in under 10 minutes.
---
lmao... if this is true, just holy shit how do they fuck up this bad? how do they *accidentally* make some servers' timescale faster than others? That is just ludicrous, and kind of lends credence to the theory that this arm of Bethesda is basically real life Vault-tec, using their players to secretly perform morbid experiments 
---
The note said that rad worms will now properly increase radiation damage. 
---
I agree, this is the root cause. I noticed last night that after getting radworms that my hunger and thirst increased dramatically and my food and drink that normally replenished around 25% were replenishing 50%. 
---
U might be right, but I already notice lot of my friends leaving the game and I'm also considering to. At least for a while til they fix things up or shut it down. 
---
Between golf and the wrecked shops due to the river for water. But it had been there months and no issues from other players until recently. 
---
Bad bot.
---
Can marsupials get on there? Or just a jetpack? 
---
I don't care, stupid human! ^(Bleep bloop. I am a carcinogenic bot and this is an automated response |) ^[info](http://redd.it/amo7ot)
---
Ok thank you :)
---
I feel a little bit of what you are describing however I've been playing the game long enough that I feel pretty good about the armor, Power Armor, ranged weapons, and melee weapons that I've collected. I am ready however for them to come out with more content.
---
and 400 xp instead of 350, better to do em 1 at a time, you get the same med and ammo reward no matter how many anyway. also it ups the chances for a 1* piece of armour the more you do the run.
---
Saying that good and bad is 100% subjective 100% of the time is only true if you believe that shit like genocide  and serial can be a good thing.
---
Society can agree that something is objectively bad, even if a lunatic claims its subjectively good. That doesn't mean the person claiming it is subjective is correct.
---
Please, go learn the actual meaning of objective and subjective, and quit it with your armchair philosophical bullshit claims.
---
Hey you on
---
OMG I thought it was just a thing that you never finished, bethesda's way to tell us to always keep going
---
Yes, that’s the one. Thank you for enlightening me
---
So about dodging in general: BB loves to punish you for dodging backwards. Papa G is a great example of this, especially his second form. Which leads to your tombstone problem. Try to position yourself so you have an escape route left or right. Some people like to get used to toggling lock on and off so you can dodge roll further and more easily control the direction. 
---
Also the weapon you use affects this. The Axe can just use the trick form charged R2 to sweep slashes through those stones to cheese G. The cane sometimes can do this in trick form as well. Other weapons require you to get in his face. Get a blunderbuss(it’s more forgiving if you fail to parry as it’ll still stagger him) and shoot just as he gets right up in front of you. Eventually you’ll get a feeling for the timing of parrying him. If he dodges back when you shoot, it’ll stagger him but you should immediately prepare to dodge as he and many other enemy hunters in this game in that situation usually counter fire with their own guns. You’ll face a really tough enemy later who loves to gun you down like this.
---
Finally be ok with using blood bullets so you can feel free to fire your gun more. Think of a blood vial = 5 free bullets. Your gun can put a lot of pressure on G as you can use it to force him to defend if he’s coming at ya and you don’t feel ready.
---
TL;DR Quick Tips: Dont dodge backwards, use blunderbuss, get used to parrying him. And get the music box and use it on his second form! It’ll give you backstabs for free as he freaks out.
---
Between golf club and wrecked shops by the river. And the bots took it down once fighting beside it, but that didn't make me upset as that was one thing in months at that same spot. 
---
ok.   any help at all would be great here lol 
---
Thanks!  
---
We have limited access to the back end of the game, all we can do is record, repeat and record, and see if we can find patterns.  
---
im immediately reminded of the hospital from Saw III for some reason
---
The simple fact you admit someone can be pro-genocide admits defeat to what I’ve said. They are, by definition, subjective. You’re acting like an absolute child.
---
&gt; One thing you apparently aren't old enough to understand yet, is that while your statement does bear some truth to it, it is not absolutely intrinsically true for every circumstance.
---
Yes and based on replies I see in this sub reddit a lot of people have no idea how survival games work. Even soft core survival games like FO76.  Ignorance of a genre doesn't suddenly validate complaints.
---
&gt; When the overwhelming majority of people do not like something? That means it is probably objectively bad. 
---
We are the race that made a man selling rocks in a card board box a millionaire.  We hate and persecute groups because a book or someone with a tie tells us they are bad.  There are literally hundreds of events in human history that you could apply that logic to that now a days would be viewed as backwards and ignorant.  But at the time a lot of people supported it so by your logic those were probably objectively good.  And I'm not even going to go for the low hanging slavery branch. Women riding bikes was once considered bad by the majority of people in Victorian Era.  Bad for their health, bad for their morals, bad for their place in society.  The over whelming majority of people agreed with that so by your logic it must have been objectively true.  Only we know it is complete bullshit.

---
And frankly I find it very odd that I can have the game for a little over a month and have so few server problems (log in/kicked off) that I can count them on one hand. While others apparently can't get on at all or can only be on for a few minutes at a time. Are the servers in Florida just better maintained then the ones in  Oregon?  Are PlayStation servers just inherently superior to Xbox or PC servers?  If it was just Bethesda then we shouldn't be having such massive differences in server stability and game play ability.  Because when I play games like GTA Online me and all my friends generally have the same server problems.  Even though we are spread out across the USA and over seas into Europe. 
---
I've given up on turrets, they do next to nothing and cost too much camp budget. 
---
I recommend browsing the map/ challenges/ atom store immediately upon loading in. Those menus work so it's better than nothing!
---
It really seems like the people at Bethesda don't even play there own game. Geesh!
---
Sorry to hear that. I know the golf course us a nice place to build but it's also a high traffic area for everyone assholes included
---
 I don't think they are doing it to extend the game, just trying to balance it.  They really should have had a much longer open beta for pre-purchasers and kept it 24/7 for a month or more.  They missed the mark on balance and are trying to play catch up poorly while dealing with the flack because it is no longer early access when people expect and deal with these issues better.
---
And god help you if you get bored of your main build. I'm going from auto TSE with melee backup to flamer medic/squad suport
---
Yeah this is def evident since the last patch. Rad worms does some weird things. The Gatling gun goes nuts with martial artist and rad worms.Rad worms also buffs explosive bobbleheads to +45% damage. 
---
doubtfull.
---
Lol well the Anthem beta was fun, so we'll see. I'm still positive it'll get better, but I may just have to wait until that's a reality before playing again as much as I used too. Games shouldn't be that frustrating. 
---
I just got this using the dirty tan suit and the bowler. Not the bowler hat, apparently they are not the same.
---
Poorly recived at launch due to issues at launch. Since then the game has changed dramatically but the same complaints are still going. Even when they become contradictory and base on ignorance of the genre game they bought. Which in turn scares off more people. 
---
I turn 60 - you are not alone!
---
 Just chill a few minutes and your odds are better. Get a drink or take a leak.
---
Vault-Tek theories aside, the instability or erratic behavior could be caused externally.  
---
Last Tuesday's and Thursday's patches re-opened a couple alleged duping loop holes, and in the little play time I've invested since said "patches" I noticed more than a couple "server not responding" errors, which are hallmarks of the duper at work (or someone spam crafting).  
---
Yes you can blame the erratic behavior on Bethesda, but those exploiting should share some of the hate.
---
We got 1 point across every attribute. Is that not enough?
---
Yar, I do the doubles as my base isn’t close, 13caps are cut from every 25c reward for fast travel
---
13/40 is much better for cap gain
---
But yes, actual item rewards are much of a muchness
---
Lol we are all the same exiting the vault basically, no one is different
---
This, or if they would incorporate a way to have saved perk settings so you could equip different setups with hotkeyed favorites, and add saved armor setups while they are at it.
---
Well, you wouldn't be able to equip even almost every perk, but it would render builds and planning obsolete.
---
I had heard that the Furious effect builds up for the first 7-8 shots in Fallout 4 which adds up to a lot. I have a furious handmade that does seem to dish out a lot more damage than standard, especially when I have 85 rounds per magazine.
---
If that's the case then what is the best legendary effect / weapon combo when going up against the SBQ? Zealot's? Anti-armor?
---
Artificial urgency encourages excessive spending.  
---
   
---
Well there's a big difference between 'warrant a drink' and 'need a drink'. xD
---
This is a really cool design! Thanks for sharing!
---
To be fair, you can't really assume anything about the people who aren't posting
---
No. I'd demand a refund.
---
Lol that would be nice, send in the White Knights. I'm on PC as well, but someone pointed out the down voting may be from actual griefers, so giving out my GT may not be good. Might just be targeted instead. But I'll add you instead. 
---
No. I deserve a refund.
---
What game are you going to play instead? Anthem? KH3? RE2?
---
Probably a case of bad luck but I've been having a difficult time finding legendaries in and around Watoga since the last update.
---
Yes. I got friends that cheat and banned and yes they don’t even bother to complain because they knew they got caught. Handful of them getting back by buying another copy but most just don’t bother. 
---
But friends that didn’t cheat and got banned most of them don’t bother either because of how broken this game is. Only handful sent tickets back to explain. That actually pretty sad that there are people got hurt in the crossfire. 
---
TBH if I was Bethesda, I would rather not ban anyone than banning an innocent players. It’s just bad PR and determine how broken the game is. One less player is one less to support your “Atom Shop” and actually have impact on our future DLC and patches and resources to allocate to this game. However, a lot of people don’t understand this and kept either shitting this game to shit or try to push a lot more players away by griefing or ignoring their legit complain about banning. 
---
Zealot currently only work on scorched humaniods and not the Scorched Beasts or the Queen. :(
---
Personally I'd like a convenience or utility pool that goes up one slot for every 5 levels.  So at 50 you can carry 10 of active cards but not all of them.  Then it'll free up some more flexibility in the perk tree. But making the utility cards cost 0 is likely a better solution.
---
Fix ur PSN settings so i type u b/c my phone is about to die so text me on PSN.
---
I seem to have better luck with groups. Then again it might be because my main group is an hour away it might enclose the server to a more local zone.
---
I kinda of understand since in other Fallout games we can horde items. 
---
There are a bunch of [related posts up](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ankly2/pacifist_mode_is_a_joke_greifing_is_apparently/), short of long going to quote myself.  
---
 
---
&gt;   
---
No.  I wouldn't be ok with that at all
---
Majority of the legendaries I loot there don't even drop from legendary mobs. Baffling.
---
 I don't like the Nerf thing, what they need to do is balance things across all classes and also balance vs the creatures.  I would prefer everything hits harder and reduce the amount of bullet sponge.
---
For some reason like half the time it’s labeled on their camp unit like “___________’s Camp”
---
Or server hopping Battle Bot for fat stacks of parially charged (usualy 50-85%) cores from the sentrybot
---
Same here, Belly of the Beast quest was in progress, had to search transponders now only have Overseer's Quest lingering. Seems the game deletes quests if you don't complete them quick enough.
---
Given up with it, just do events and explore now.
---
What about Watoga bots (after doing the Mayor quest)?
---
They made a choice to allow perk cards so you can change your build, but hinder actual build changes by only allowing 1 point to be changed per level up... Seems counterintuitive to me....
---
Had this same thought a few weeks back. Would give you extra space for some "passive" perks. Wouldn't be able to max every branch still. Less switching back and forth. And like ya said it just fits with the whole theme. 
---
I'd love this
---
You literally do not understand what objective means, in this context or any other.
---
There are objective truths that plenty of people deny. It is objectively true that the holocaust happened, it is objectively true that the earth is not flat.
---
Yet some people still claim it so. That does not suddenly make those facts subjective simply because someone claims so.
---
You literally have no fucking idea what you are talking about.
---
I’d want a refund since I just got it heavily discounted a couple weeks ago... be pretty upset to not even get more than couple days to play it
---
&gt;People will actually start capturing your workshop, and their teammate who's come and found you can instantly PVP you
---
Usually a super low level will bait you, and his level 200 friend with his bloodied build will come and ruin your day
---
Did you seriously just use the "it didnt happen to me so it isn't real" defense?
---
Yes if you use heavy guns. Which I do. So if your on Xbox lemme know. 
---
How were you able to message them? Are you on a console? I'm on PC. There is no chat unfortunately.
---
I did something similar while taking part in an event. I threw a grenade and when it exploded it hit her as well and put a bounty on me. When the event was finished, I asked her to kill me to remove the bounty. She was bit surprised. lol I said it was better her than looking over my shoulder and getting killed when it was inconvenient. Thank-you random melee girl! Also she didn't take any of my junk which was a bonus.
---
 I find these design choices by Bethesda very frustrating.  I can deal with it since I would never touch this game in PVP so it really does not impact me that much, but there is simply no balance and it is frustrating.  
---
The fire rate is useless because it's a one shot then you reload and it depends on whether you have a build for heavy weapons and if you want to make a build for it
---
That's why you drop it somewhere someone else will find it, either at the overseers camp or at flatwoods. Or any major traffic area
---
I am on xbox
---
Inspector's outfit is an overarmor.  The trouble is certain underarmors (specifically the Operatives and Marine, I believe) were improperly coded to replace both overarmor and underarmor.  My teammate ran into this, and we tested various underarmors with the Inspector's outfit and other costumes.  The biggest culprits for displacing an outfit were the marine and scout operatives underarmors.  
---
if there is not a timer over the item, they remain. Some timed item might return, no info on this atm
---
Just what a game that crashes constantly needs, for buffs to reset when it crashes... 
---
Also a thing. It's why I run pacifist 99.9% of the time and just don't give a shit about workshops.
---
No, anyone telling you this is either:  
---
-Griefing or "grifting" you.  
---
-Using an exploit.  
---
-Trying to con twice the work for half the price.
---
Then re start Windows XP and reinstall the OS and clean your keyboard.
---
Lmao.
---
They should have launched a finished game and anyone who paid $60 or more for it at launch deserves a refund. That was not a 'normal' black friday sale. I feel totally cheated and I wanted to love it so much. Even when the beta was having issues. Bethesda owes its fanbase a true treasure of sorts. 
---
Where do you get the two full cores?
---
The game doesn't work jackass.
---
Ya I have them mostly for looks, but they can’t even deal with the level 6 scorched around my base without at least one blowing up
---
I'm not really sure what shutting the servers down for a year would do to help compared to regular updates on the live server, other than costing Bethesda a bunch of money.
---
Never happened to me since they "fixed" it.  
---
And i kill enemies quite fast.
---
Thanks for the info. I'll have to check it out sometime.
---
Yesterday a lvl 20 gave me 1200 .308 ammo. I don't think he knew what he was getting rid of. I use my sniper rifle more than anything.
---
Those are people’s beliefs in spite of facts. That is irrelevant. Things like that cannot be subjective as they are one or the other. You’ve used a terrible example to continue arguing against an objective truth about subjectivity and human opinion disparities. Gonna assume you’re like 15.
---
There are dozens of reasons why people disliked the game at launch, and only some of them have been fixed. I sincerely doubt any significant number of people that hated the game at launch are going to love it now. 
---
Regardless, that's irrelevant. The game was extremely poorly received at launch and may have hurt Bethesda's reputation significantly. That's what makes it a disaster. To suggest otherwise is laughable. Maybe Bethesda can turn it around and improve the game's reputation, though given their history of patching the game I doubt it.
---
What's wrong with trading with other players?
---
Sorry for the delay, had to take my dog to the vet.

Boy that sure is weird how the wikis are wrong as fuck huh?
---
It's almost as if they just copied their Fallout 4 entries to populate their Fallout 76 entries, and because no one uses or understands the Broadsider, it has never been updated on those wikis.
---
I doubt you'll respond, instead you will probably just scurry away in the face of actual in game evidence until you find someone else to ignorantly accuse of being wrong.
---
Of course you have to hop servers more, it's another effect of the mutation /s
---
lol yeh that would be funny
---
Then I have lost loot, because my friends stopped playing along the way 
---
I do this all the time. Always check. One man's trash is another man's treasure. 
---
Do you have speed demon, because I do. Fallout 76 in now a hunting sim for me.
---
Need any parts? I can craft all except raider
---
I hear you. Hope it gets sorted out soon :) 
---
I've noticed this also, but figured it was just a luck thing.  I have had really good luck lately picking the l3 lock at the transit hub and getting both the core in the generator and the power armor. 
---
You may even get legendary wood armor which is worth 6 caps 
---
&gt;That is irrelevant. 
---
Your belief about this game in spite of facts? I agree.
---
Nice try moving the goal posts, but you still do not understand what the terms objective and subjective mean, you are just grasping at straws trying to make a narrative to fit your argument, and are failing miserably.
---
If you go back and read through each patch notes you’ll find the note where they nerfed legendary spawns. I honestly feel the game became less fun since that happened. 
---
I don't know if I've noticed it effect them honestly
---
 Yes, they should.  
---
.50 cal for hunting rifle can be created in batches of 100+ tho, much easier to get a hold of
---
I love the earlier conspiracy theory that they are children that hid in the mines after the blast and mutated into what we see... 
---
So we are effectively killing mutated children, hence why you often find toys on them..

Little over two days ago my wife deleted my email account on Xbox (deleted my alias) which deleted my account all together. This account was linked my bethasda account. (joshua.and.andrea.martin@hotmail.com). My account is 13 days passed when I was supposed to hear my final respond to my appeal. I haven't been able to play for nearly a month now. My user name is Archcasp. My ref # is 190117-003072. I would like to know my final respond  or if I can get my account back. Thank you.
---
ATM it's a terrible weapon, but if and when Bethesda rebalances maybe it won't suck
---
When will we get THICC dwellers?
---
You shouldn't be able to sell ammo. If one .38 ammo was sold for 1 cap. You could instantly get thousands
---
I whip my PA out to jump off cliffs when I don't want to take the time to thread my way down. 
---
First example isn’t griefing.  That’s a random encounter with some raiders and a perfect example of the bounty system working like it should.
---
The second example isn’t griefing.  It just shows how much pvp is in the favor of the attacked.
---
If it’s something a mole rat would do it is not griefing.  If players couldn’t attack your base they would have to add human NPCs raiders to take their place.
---
 Really don't try to make logical sense out of Bethesda choices.  They are fun quirky games, but I am pretty sure they all get drunk when choosing components.
---
really. so i have to win the rng lottery twice...
---
Blatant fucking lies. Wow. 
---
Any posts saying otherwise were just dupers trying to get the community to post shit just like this so maybe they won't lose their accounts.

Respectfully disagree. The updates always cause a few negative changes or new bugs, and the last thing I want is to see people crying every day like they cry on patch days. xD  
---
It's probably also easier on Bethesda if they release less frequently, so hopefully that leads to better quality for us.
---
Thank you
---
No
---
I need to get rid of magazines, I have quite a few. I might have to have a fire sale to make room for new magazines. 
---
There is no competition in the direction bethesda is currently going with Fallout 76
---
Thank you very much, I'll be sure to look for that one next time I play.
---
Hmm that's interesting.  I can't find any other sources about it, I wonder if there are any strings attached or if it really is that easy.
---
Here’s the other problem. If two raiders team up, they can just cap each other’s bounties and grief endlessly. I had two do that to my alt’s base, both tossing orbital strike beacons. 30 seconds later neither were wanted anymore. 
---
I have 500 hours in this game.  I know the difference between “Signs &amp; Letters” and “Small Letters,” and I indeed got it as a reward. 
---
Because that's what it will be. I mean, thanks to Duping it kind of already is, but at least this would be official pay to win.
---
No shit
---
They have so many shotgun shells though....
---
Applies to undelievered stashes also. Shot down a delivery drone and interacting with the container would count as stealing. Probably wasn' t even close to it's dedicated delivery zone. 
---
I want the 12,7mm pistol 
---
Neato
---
I think I am just missing a right leg T-60.  
---
None of these. Was thinking of mutant: year zero, maybe 
---
I like this theory.  Now the glowing meat we get off them... is it mole miner meat or some they scavenged.  Am I eating mutated children?
---
I don't know..  
---
I want a stable game, and the current instability and some patch problems have gutted the user base (let's stop lying to ourselves).   
---
Support a month, or two, to allow for some serious Dev time focusing on issues?  
---
Yes..   
---
 I've personally submitted almost 70'ish bug reports in the last 2 days that are literal no brainers, I've included both the problem and the fix.  There is about another 70,000 characters of reports to file.
---
If downtime means they get reviewed, implemented and we have a stable game..  
---
Yes.
---
The last patch might have undone that.
---
Cool story. Get a lawyer if they failed to keep up their end if the agreement. Literally nothing we can do here.
---
Or a supply drone brings you a crate with the items. 
---
You could require a quest to unlock it.
---
....Somehow I never realized this, and it ruins my RP character. I named him The Plumber, he's fat, receding hairline, wears overalls, bushy mustache, and only uses pipe weapons/pipe wrench. Now he's just called junglemoose and it makes no sense. I am now sad.
---
It pretty much is.   Compounded by Bethesda's continued ignominious conduct. 
---
I know Bethesda apologists hate these posts, but they really are fucking over their fanbase.
---
Also if you have Rad Worms it’s bugged and basically multiples a TON of effect by 50%
---
You can scrap ammo? Where?

X-01?

Switch to a real suit of PA.. Raider or at the least T-60, X-01 is for chumps ;).  
---
They just need to keep making iterative updates, fixing issues and adding new content. I am enjoying the trip.
---
Yeah this sucks. This Nerf sucks more than the TSE one
---
You are, it's effectively like eating your cousin...
---
Mantaman suit also doesn't take up the hand slot like it should. Really hope these things get fixed if they expect people to pay money for them.
---
They could tone down the drain a lot
---
Right now I am grinding to be able to grind for quests

Wasn't it from handing in technical data? I swear I got a plan or two of BoS from there
---
Watoga bots always attack Phoenix. They hate him cause they aint him. As for the Molemen, no idea
---
this guy has the right idea. or just you know, rework the weight perks so they dont (in possibility) take up over a third of your possible special, just so you have the QoL to not have to dump stuff every hour.
---
Class action lawsuit?  That would be funny/awesome.

Don't tell us, just do it.

much of the atom shop was created years ago
---
If you're ***really*** in the min-max stage, there is *one* outfit (worn over armor and underarmor) that has a special bonus, and *one* headwear that adds damage resistance. Tattered dress gives +1 perception, and tattered mole head gives +1 DR. Throw those on over your underarmor and armor of choice, and enjoy slightly bigger numbers than you'd have wearing any other outfit and had. You're welcome.
---
Wish I could take credit for this but the idea stemmed from nearly every other RPG out there, especially online ones....
---
Looks like the dwemer lense machine you needed to use in Skyrim
---
Thank you both
---
How do I get the name thing next to yours?
---
What level do you need to be to go to whitesprings?
---
Usually when you see in faction hostility there was a glitch when the NPC spawned in and their factions didn't populate properly..  
---
So they are killing the "not one of us"..
---
He shouldn't have cheated then.
---
Huh, good to know. 
---
To be fair the game hasn’t had any new content since release, lol. 
---
I want an event where you compete to become King of the Nuka Cola Factory with the Mole Miners as you own Oompa Loompas.
---
Why shutdown the servers? They can just continue to update the game and get live feedback from the people playing.
---
So did mine 
---
Literally the greatest achievement Bethesda made with this game is “Mole Miners”
---
I’ll sell one to you for 250
---
They live a miserable and tortured existence trapped inside their protective suits. Killing them is mercy. 
---
The recent Demolition Expert nerf made them way worse than they already were. 
---
Probably a different department than those that handle content creation. 
---
Makes sense. Never noticed it before. 
---
They had bug fixes and stuff like that
---

Tuesday is the weekly reset. Alongside the weekly reset is the theme of the week, which brings new permanent items to the Atom Shop. Limited-Time items and sales on pre-existing items appear randomly throughout the week Wednesday through Saturday. There's no gurantee a item will appear on a specifc day, so you're pretty much encouraged to login every day to see what's new 
---
As of this moment, nobody knows when/if limited time will return (if ever), so it's pretty much "get it while you can and take no chances"
---
Which is why I regret not buying the Blackbird paint
---
Ur welcome 
---
Any single criticism, no matter how justified, gets down voted to hell. Even video evidence of glitches and bugs get downvoted. They've lost their fanboy minds

You could have drawn the red beggars bag to be the renowned fallout 76 nylon bag 
---
Only happened to me twice. Once at the ammo factory (expected) the other at Grafton Steel of all places (don't judge. As a flamer user i go through soooo much steel)
---
Can I do this on mobile or do I need to use my pc? Cuz I tapped my name and it kissed shows my Reddit age and karma
---
With no loot on her...
---
Yes! Ever since the update I've noted my character has been thirsty all the time with food being a little better. 
---
What is wrong with being homeless? The homeless are people also. Just because they do not have an address with a roof and 4 walls and a maintained floor does nkt make them any less human than you are. If you want to fix the economy, great, but start with the homeless first.  /S
---
How was this grief  sorta 😂 u didn't get slapped to death or base demolition just a moss man coming in an using the loo..
---
Block them.  It reduces the damage they do to you even further and they can’t see you on map anymore.
---
If you don’t shoot back you will have plenty of time to block them, and damage will be reduced to the point you can heal faster than they can hurt you.
---
My wife griefers every few days, she just blocks them and starts taking photos till they get frustrated and leave.  Hundreds of hours of play, she’s been killed maybe 3-4 times, all before she found the block feature.
---
I use an extra set of power armor to block door ways so mobs can't get through and then shoot grenades into it killing everything.
---
Lately I started putting thousands of rounds of 10 mm ammo in random Train stations. Same with nukes and missiles.
---
If you are ever in any Train station check ALL containers... I have found stuff before and I have left stuff before. \[Xbox one\]
---
They even re-introduced some bugs 
---
Sometimes they stick around. Encountered a flatwoods monster near site prime and it was a satisfying ruckus. He turned two scorchbeasts and a deathclaw pink, along with their entourage. 
---
Definitely think all cryptids would benefit from a big buff to make them more dangerous and durable across the board though.
---
Its a big bug party!
---
The shop is automated.
---
The silver shroud costume has been known to exist since launch.
---
One of the perks of pc being involved and datamining
---
No shut down needed, just implement a Test Server on PC.
---
exactly. there are too many "needed" perks for quality of life. its ridiculous. id love to make a pistol build in this game but i literally dont even have enough points total in agi (15 cap vs 18 needed) to fully spec into pistols, including their utility perks, which also moves out so many quality of life perks (thru hiker, adrenaline high level, action boy) it wouldnt even be worth it.
---
I thought they just made them as they go
---
It's thanks to folks like you that I'm able to use my AGL as often as I do.
---
I'm on mobile and under my pic, age and karma it shows three options, one of which is change your user flare
---
Yeah... none of that is true. I don't work for them anymore, but I spent 8 months with them interning as a lobbyist and grassroots coordinator. The ASPCA just doesn't own shelters. They have 2 flagship shelters but people often get confused and believe their local SPCA is the same thing. It isn't. If you want to help out shelters, you'd be better off giving your money directly to your local shelter. The ASPCA's number one goal isn't to house animals and try to find them homes. They focus on improving the lives of animals by advocating for harsher punishments for animal abusers, identifying and shutting down puppy mills, and lobbying for better treatment of farm animals (usually having more space to move around.) They're not even a freaking vegan organization (I love steaks) and certainly aren't giving money to radical groups. They are very transparent with their funding and I encourage you to go on charitynavigator.org to see how it is spent. There's plenty of good charities and plenty of bad ones and the ASPCA isnt perfect, but I can guarantee you the people that work there genuinely love animals and bust their ass every day trying to make their lives a little better. 
---
well, im speculating based off of the development timeline. mb.
---
Not sure if this is ironic or not
---
Oh I found it I’m just dum lol 
---
There you go!
---
By about 1 point. Barely any different
---
I honestly think until the nerf, people really werent highly motivated to quit because they secretly had hope. Fallout 4 was a blast in my opinion and i think thats what kept people hopeful. After the nerf though i think they severly dashed a lot of hopes for this game becoming more than what it was at release. 
---
Another few thousand years and Chernobyl will be habitable again. 
---
Your post is literally just complaining about what people have been saying since the first week. It's ignorant to blame Bethesda for your own twisted expectations. This is a multiplayer survival mmo. The game was presented from the start to have interactions, good and bad, with other people. You are literally the guy who smokes his whole life, then is shocked when he gets lung cancer. You knew the risks. It's part of the game. Bethesda already knows about all the casual players like you whining about PvP. They are making a PvP mode and people like you are trying to dictate how that will be done too. Ffs if you don't want to participate in PvP, play a single player game without such a hostile setting. And stop trying to influence this game to be rid of PvP, because you see every player who does anything different than giving you free loot, to be a griefer.
---
I think I have .50 receiver that does equal damage to .308. Don't really use such low rate of fire weapons anymore.
---
God I hated that thing.

Apex Legends has been out less than a day and has a roadmap.  A good game if you like fast paced shooters, not for everyone.  I was surprised by how polished it is for a free to play game.
---
I've uninstalled Fallout on Xbox and PC and feel much more relieved.  I've written it off as a loss and if they improve it in 6 months then it's a win.  It was frustrating caring so much about it to see how badly mismanaged it was.  I recommend anyone frustrated with 76 to uninstall and take a break.  
---
I thought of that!
---
100 ammo rounds for 1 cap is fair trade.
---
Thanks :)
---
This is West Virginia, not Alabama.
---
A roadmap should already be in place.  I agree with you on how it shouldn't take long.  But we all know why.  They don't have a clue 😂
---
Looks like i'll be moving my camp.
---
Omg, right in the feels :'(
---
You must be one of the rare exceptions, I get that issue all the time. 
---
Rng loot shouldnt apply to the queen, she should have her own unique table thats worth it to burn the hundreds-thousands of ammo. It's stupid as hell
---
Heres another.

You mean Flatwoods? Cuz I no find flat springs on the map
---
I drew my version in a new post... lol 
---
Well I can tell you that Bethesda will completely blame your computer, no matter how much info you give to show it isn't the computer's fault. 
---
Yep, the Overseer's Cache in Flatwoods gets a lot of traffic from me. Have some flannel shirts and fancy machetes, vault dwellers!
---
You can.  It's called trading.
---
That is a nice idea, and I agree. It would be cool KNOWING that you get something unique from fighting her.
---
What does sunshine oil even do?
---
right? where do bethesda get these design decisions from?
---
This is why i personally settle for a 30% increase for 3 points, rather than 60% for 9.
---
Yeah, sorry.  Been a few weeks since I've logged in.

There is a PC with lore in a trailer home near the red rocket down there.  Recipe is nearby somewhere, although I exactly remember where.

---
i got it a little wrong, still server hopping was nerfed
---
Sweet, I shall go look around, gratzi 
---
&gt;It would be kinda nice to yield some extra lead, steel and possibly nuclear material from scrapping ammo, but the question must be asked as to why you picked it up in the first place.
---
Easy. Because it weights nothing and can be used or traded for.
---
Could you please give us more than one place to respawn and introduce the original promise that we can respawn at our CAMP or the vault. I'm still being only offered one place to respawn and being charged caps for the privilege. 
---
I didn’t even know they nerfed it, makes a lot of sense now 
---
Let me start by saying I'm in a similar situation...   
---
Those who freak out at these kind of posts look away.   
---
I pre-ordered the Power Armor Edition, and doubling down on what was now clearly a flawed decision, I ordered off the Bethesda Store itself (Which is not Bethesda... But is Bethesda.).  
---
$55 dollars in guarantied overnight, day of launch, arrived 2 weeks and 3 days after launch, if memory serves.   
---
To make up for it, Bethesda sent me a digital code for launch, that didn't work..  
---
The Power Armor edition arrived in a staved in box, wrecked on one side completely, and based on reading the return policies I've not opened it, because if I do I can't return it.    
---
They've not responded to any emails, including about the digital code not working, so after 6? Weeks I started a charge back...  
---
Am I angry, disappointed, and left with a bad taste in my mouth?  
---
Yes, I am...  
---
I'm sure my emails are sitting in some completely overwhelmed persons inbox, and at some point I'll get a response, or I won't, but I'm letting my CreditCard company handle it, because guess what, it's their job. 
---
    
---
And I'm pretty sure none of it was directly targeting me, I'm just an unfortunate statistic in one of the rockier launches in video game history.
---
Assuming you've not checked out over my ridiculously long response...
---
During all of this I'm also actively trying to improve the game,  because in the end I'm pretty sure there are allot of people at Zenimax/Bethesda loosing sleep at night over the last 4'ish months and how bad things have gotten.    
---
Not enough dakka!
---
https://imgur.com/a/fgRWv2u
---
I’ve been keeping tabs on the game. How would you guys rate it now compared to release?
---
To be honest, I don’t think the disconnects are entirely your computers nor install folders fault 
---
Sometimes I have zero disconnects in 4 hours, the next day it disconnects every 5-11 minutes and seems to do so very consistently 
---
I believe PC has different rules as its easier to stop the hackers from abusing mechanics than stop them from hacking.
---
Seems like a lot of people don't understand that OPs main point is that it didn't feel that rewarding or fun, not that he messed up and couldn't/didn't launch one. 
---
Also I've had quite a few times where the game crashed while I was inside with a buddy, which meant I had to start completely over. Had it happen three times in a row. 
---
You realize you can make a cosmetic item in likely 15-30 minutes to do a simple reskin
---
Me too tbh, I love the visuals but replay value is low as all I'm doin is bulking junk n buyin plans.. I jus wanna fight ppl lol
---
Level 43.. Spawned far away from where I was, ended up near sons of Dane compound which I hadn't even found yet. I was stuck in a pit near some RVs with what seemed like 100 legendary diseased rats, wendigos and those blobs of shit looking scorched dudes on top of me freaking out. Couldn't move other than to swing my blade of Bastet while starving and dehydrated (which was not the case prior to spawning). I was barely taking damage but killed all those frenzied hoarde bastards. Was able to loot the bodies which were on top of me....had about 50 legendary items which was the first time I found anything other than a nocturnal pipe. Went to switch servers and poof...disconnected. ended up with about 4 pieces of assassins armor and junk had disappeared 
---
It just works!
---
The issue is that as far as their open world games go. This is the first game they’ve had to fix. Usually modders would fix it for them. You can argue that they had to fix their games on consoles before mods were allowed but from what I saw, it took months if not years before all the bugs were finally ironed out in games like Skyrim on the consoles. I still got a thieves guild quest breaking bug when I booted up Skyrim last year on ps4 (no mods with all updates). 
---
Any. Just prepare to fight off 400 ghouls and the occasional Grafton monster or wendigo in the Whitesprings area.
---
Looks great...didn’t expect that!
---
I’m so proud!
---
Thank you for this post. 
---
Japan still likes armbands. But yeah, an outfit would be cool but I think the Free Staters would make it very simple like a patch or something, don't got time to waste making uniforms when they were barely holding on out there.
---
I know I had this same bug! I was fighting a Mirelurk Queen, I turned around and the health bar came off my screen when I turned around she was full health. She wasn't a legendary and I wasn't in a event area for it either. I honestly thought it was only me on console that this bug happened to.
---
Try getting 90% through a silo only to have it crash. You have to start completely over. 
---
Now have it happen two more times in less than 30 minutes of each other. 
---
They will. But there’s no urgency and they’re probably being so heavily bombarded by disgruntled fans that they don’t even know where to start. 
---
What weapons are you using? 
---
This is a really good idea. I usually shoot radstags with reckless abandon, not a single thought that it could belong to a player.
---
I pretty much only used .308 until around level 60, and hoarded it. Now I only use .45 and 556. Funny how times change
---
No, in Watoga
---
I for one wish that Vats didn't target other players while passive mode is active. Ideally there should be an ingame option with player preference. 
---
For example:
---
- "vats will target all friendly and hostile targets"
---
- "vats will only target hostile NPCs"
---
- "vats will target all hostile enemies including other players who are wanted or have passive mode disabled"
---
The more commonly seen error is the "RETREAT" legendary SuperMutant I think...
---
True they were struggling, so maybe make it a pre war thing when they were ok? Maybe you find it at Charleston Harold since they were known to associate with the Free States.
---
Looks like the starting room in Verrükt.
---
Lol, that doesn’t count. 
---
/r/whoosh

Are we doing wishlists?

1.  Add Content

2.  Add more content

3.  Continue adding content
---
PS.  Grinding a hamster wheel does not qualify as content to me.
---
Imagine if your character had a ammo crafting skill that determines the chance of making ammo that actually fires properly.  Within your batch of X rounds crafted there are an amount that end up being useless duds that don’t fire a projectile and jam your weapon.  Perk cards reduce your chances of making bad ammo by 33%/66%/99%.
---
That would be so immersive.

That one references the same Tweet as the Reddit post.  All the articles I've seen reference that one tweet, I really can't find any other sources.  Although I don't know why a developer would lie about that, if they'd lie you'd think they pad the time not go the other way.
---
Western Variant is the best in comparison but the atom shoo did say .44 not .44 calibers or anything stating something different and I think there is a way just gotta contact bethesda support seen a lot of ppl get refunds for stuff bought on accident and I don't disagree wish it worked for all revolvers.
---
go to r/fo76bazaar and see what sells to other players.   i have made a ton from selling my unused popular ammo and uncommon/rare plans to others.

leave it in suitcases and containers at train stations and it will find a good home

If you build it high enough not even a jetpack can get to it.

Wrong gun dude. The golden paint is for the .44 revolver only. 
---
My interactions with Ghost People in Dead Money definitely affect my prejudice when dealing with Mole Miners.

Yea players throwing a shit fit over TSE nerf that needed to be done isn't bad. Particularly when the reasons against it are pretty much just "because I want an OP as fuck weapon that ruins PvE and PvP."

I'm not really so trusty with other players. Especially with duped items going around and as well as scammers.

I don't know how common scamming is or if it's even possible but I have heard stuff about it. When it comes to the trading system, I have no idea how it works as I've never used it or if it's even exploitable.
---
I'm at the point where i'm nearing the cap cap (lol) and vasically dump everything i can't use to twink my alt into the Flatwoods Church register. Plans, legendaries, all the 308 ammo i seem to accumulate... the lot. Unless i can find a random lowbie to dump it all on

Hi, I'm a bot (in Beta). I combined your list of YouTube videos into one shareable highlight reel link:  https://app.hivevideo.io/view/b47ccd

So I did some math.   I don’t know why my sledge was showing 280 damage.   After all perks added to a level 40 sledge, and my strength at 14, 191 damage is correct.   Wish I knew why it was showing 280 before.  
---
I can vouch for the sneak builds, I spend almost all of my time crouched for sneaking, anymore from the moment I log in until I log out, I have caution displayed over my head. The only time it isn't is when it says danger. Once in a blue moon, I will be hidden, but then I take a step and I back under caution. I will be this way, no matter where I am. It really does get annoying having to look over my back because I don't know if that caution is legitimate, or some screwed up code set that got thrown into this last hotfix. I don't remember if it was happening between the patch and the hotfix, but I know it has been since the hotfix for sure. 
---
I don’t think bethesda will turn the servers back on after a year 
---
&gt; There are dozens of reasons why people disliked the game at launch, and only some of them have been fixed.
---
Many of them have been fixed. But people ignore that fact to complain.
---
&gt; The game was extremely poorly received at launch and may have hurt Bethesda's reputation significantly. 
---
Only if you believe the bullshit people are peddling and never actually play the game. 
---
&gt; To suggest otherwise is laughable.
---
Actually it isn't because when you get away from circle jerk sub reddits like this one the debate is actually a lot more open. 
---
You can build it anywhere I just used that location because it's nice and flat. 
---
bulking it to sell would be good, i’ve been putting it in containers at train stations or using free fast-travel to vault 76 and dropping.38 rounds on the dead Responder corpses.
---
This. So much this please Bethesda. Or even a simple rename system 
---
LiTeRaLlY UnPlAyAble! 
---
That’s asinine though, one can only hope they will fix it.
---
&gt;Nerf guns then you have to nerf bosses then you have yo go back and buff/nerf the guns again in an endless cycle.
---
Fact!
---
In the UI it shows entire inventories, they set a price and you can buy it from them for that price. Buying things for caps is safe. It's trading with other players that isn't safe. Have to both set an item for 0c or both drop an item on the ground or something like this
---
I believe it’s about level 20 you can survive, but the more higher leveled people you see the harder it will be. 
---
Try and stay around the robots, they will fight anything off, avoid buildings except the main building, and get inside as soon as you can, it’s safe inside. 
---
It doesn't count Starlight Cobbler or Sweet Rolls either.  :(

Yeah, I had found a 3* nocturnal before I found stand fast. Immediately went and sold stand fast.
---
I def think it’s this too. I never had this bug until yesterday... but my internet was also garbage yesterday too, for some reason. I noticed lag in lots of other places too and assumed this enemy healing “bug” was just a symptom of lag.
---
\*shrug\*  
---
Just trying to say it's complicated, don't take it personally, and try and handle it in a way that won't taint your own existence.  
---
Won't lie, the Charge back call took almost an hour, explaining a pre-order video game and the rest was a challenge, but worth it to wash my hands of it.
---
&gt; 183035 liters

How do you have an enclave flair and dare to say "Drone" instead of "Eyebot"
---
You say that......  
---
But when all the caned food is gone, everyone's guts are gnawing, and Clem over there is asleep on Sentry duty, AGAIN....
---
As much as i love the game i can't help but think there's much more than a skeleton crew working on it now as progrmmers, artists and etc get reshuffled on to other projects.
---
Potentially amazing game, but like so many 2018 releases so much wasted potential
---
One of my favorite comments ever. Can you imagine the songs but it's just heavy breathing
---
I just assumed Bethesda is very modern. 
---
How else could you explain having a mental disability as a job requirement?
---
copied/updated from when someone suggested 75 a few weeks ago:
---
 That would basically remove any vestige of  character specialization. It's literally six attributes at 12, one at 11.  It's hard to pretend you have a different character layout  when the largest stat difference is likely 3 of 15.
---
Even  beyond that, if acknowledging that there is generally at least one  attribute that most players don't find that useful for any of their play  styles (for me, that is Endurance, because most the perks meh and you  really don't need a maxed out charisma), you could leave that stat 'low'  and have a 15 / 15 / 5 / 10 / 10 / 15 / 13 build with every combat  attribute maxed, L3 perk sharing and emptying out vendor caps supplies,  all the durability loss reduction and crafting you'd need, and crit for  days - all with lowest stat still a 5 (my melee build character has a  charisma of 1).  If you are solo and perk sharing and team perks are useless for you, geez now you are 15/15/5/6/12/15/15 and still have  lonesome wanderer and demo perks too.
---
15s are supposed to be unusual, not half of everyones build.  Same philosophy applies to virtually every RPG.
---
Additionally, there is a house, but I can't find it anymore. It's the "cat lady" house and there has to be, like seriously, 30 cat bowls.
---
I thought "in a day or two" was SOP for inside the vault
---
That or radx
---
Crafty evil genius.
---
If only there was some way to make you and your upvoting buddies comprehend that your ugly cynicism is affecting not Bethesda but us other players on this forum. 
---
It totally doesn’t matter how right you may be. This kind of comment adds nothing but toxicity. 
---
I'll give him two cans. 
---
While I believe the dehydration factor is a little extreme, I guess I am used to it as I have kidney disease and lived in Phoenix, AZ for 15 years. I had to have a Camelback water system with me at all times during the summer as I could get so dehydrated within 20 minutes of being outside, and not even in the sun. However, I keep 1 small water purifier and I do not have a problem with hydration, except maybe having too much water sometimes. While, I don't know how many hours I have in the game, I can tell you it has to be in the upper 3 digits, if not 4 digits of hours already. I did have to take a 10 day break due to being in the hospital almost dying from some rare virus that can affect people that have had organ transplants. 
---
I would love to know how everyone knows how many hours they have in a game. I am on xbox if that helps. 
---
Agreed. Sadly sony are quite tight lipped about a lot of processes it seems (which, as it is their system makes sense), so we may never really know
---
I work on an old military base that's since closed. Most of the base has been converted but the other building (and bunkers) look a lot like this photo. I love exploring it all on my free time! 
---
100% this
---
Wait what, there's a Soda Jerk in 76? (Beta Player am confusion).
---
I can’t tell if you’re trolling or not but it’d make this already massively tedious game impossible to play
---
Just grind whitesprings with a melee weapon
---
Tru
---
You got it! I love the camp system and sharing info with others. :)
---
Must agree looks like rapture uncovered
---
They haven't yet because they want to put in a favorites system so you dont accidentally scrap good stuff. 
---
I would love this!! I loved doing this in new Vegas 
---
They should add a friendly one that is similar to graham in a update 
---
unusable, just like the game. heh.
---
Need ballistic fiber? Server hop camp mcclintock
---
I politely disagree. There's room for a difference of opinion. Please don't let any negativity affect you personally. 
---
And I believe I'm being a realist as opposed to a cynic. 
---
For what it's worth, I literally (just tonight) encountered my first legitimate griefers in the game, after playing ~400 hours since beta.
---
It wasn't more than a few seconds' inconvenience, but I hadn't seen it before, so that was new. (Basically two dudes trying to wreck my base.)
---
They are so rad.
---
Is it a troll if it fits within the completely sarcastic context of the entire thread?
---
I suppose I should have put an /s at the end.
---
MMH mmh MMH mmh MMH MMH MMH mmh
---
mmh mmh mmh MMH MMH mmh mmh MMH MMH
---
This was going to be my suggestion. 
---
That’s not a difference of opinion.
---
That’s cynical shit you’re dumping on our heads, then politely blaming Bethesda for behaving like an asshole. 
---
Uhhhkay, hows that cool aid??
---
Whoa buddy. You’re the toxic one. 
---
**FOR SIGMAR!** 
---
I wish I would have waited. They have an exclusive white edition along with that bundle.
---
See, i imagined it'd be something discreet like a lapel pin what with how prewar the Free States were seen by the Government were (iirc, from what lore i've found) treated as seditionists and possible Chinese colaborators
---
Yeah
---
The cap on weight reduction perks is 50?
---
cobbler isn't pie bud. 
---
This story circulated on the sub weeks ago.  Never tested it.  People sounded earnest.  But internet....
---
"... Aaand *improperly* increase everything else. You know, might as well while we got the code open"
---
I think I used to do this back in the Asherons Call days.
---
Fort defiance for fiber.
---
I usually find 6-8 bags in there are 2 a pop.  You might have to hop to get a full spawn. 
---
Bloodied ofc
---
What melee weapon? I have the Black Diamond, but I don't really have a better one. Every time I've gone there recently it's either low level ghouls or really high level ones. I went tonight, twice, and both times the highest level enemy was level 23.
---
I also have been looking and haven't found them at all. Quite annoying. 
---
Bruh forget repairing armor just buy leather armor from the dude that just sells armor in whitesprings ..or go in market subs and request ballistic 
---
How do you sever hop? Just log out and right back in?
---
Let’s go even further.  Your weapon and armor crafting skills determine the chances of creating a defective weapon affected with a negative affix.
---
Like “Plasticized Chest Armor”.  Your low intelligence and horrible armor crafting resulted in mistakenly making steel chest armor out of plastic.  It does absolutely nothing and breaks after the first impact from literally any enemy weapon.
---
Market subs?
---
Yep sometimes puts toy back in the same server or its been looted don't ger discouraged though and soldier on!
---
Only on my melee char do I have more than 2 points in end. Otherwise all I use from endurance is good dog perk and dromedary. Endurance barely has useful perks as it is.
---
That Gun from NV was a ref to a FO2 Unique :)
---
its not rare buddy. Really common.
---
Also, there's a bag that nearly doubles fire rat once upon a log in.
---
Is this another thing they patched out? O remember finding at least one or two legendaty bots going through Watoga but went there last night and didn't find any. I tried later today, again nothing.
---
Burn it and start from scratch?
---
what platform?  Maybe someone will group with you to lighten the load &amp; help you grind
---
Are u PS4?
---
Yep.
---
Mmmmm dual.  That’s what I want.
---
Interesting. I'm lvl 57. 
---
I can show u how to **** sh** up in whitespring 
---
Lol, I have all the rifleman Perks, also bloody mess, adrenaline, Adrenal reaction, tormentor, glow sight and even gun fu and 
---
still need to headshot glowing ones like 5 times to get them down. Using a two shot lever action 
---
Chernobyl also looks like fallout 
---
The purple glow is a separate effect to the texture and the model, so it's possible it just didn't load.
---
I have 3 standard ground water purifiers. I have about 10 corn. With vegitarian I can play for a long time before needing to go back. I make corn into corn soup and keep purified water because that drains a little faster. I've had no issues. 
---
Grab a super sledge and use that when she's on the ground... you'll do more damage and save some ammo.
---
Yep, the vault Handy called me Mr. Archer but I don't think any in the game world can or will. 
---
"One thing you are ignoring is what time of day you are playing. The fact that you have 300+ hours means you are playing a lot; so, you must not be playing all of your game hours at the same time as OP"  
---
Well, let me sort this out for you by firstly saying this makes no sense. If anything playing a lot means I more than likely play at the same time he does, a long with a bunch of times that he doesn't. I'll play anytime I can. That just means my sample size is not only larger but wider. A lot of other people in this thread have also said the exact same thing.  
---
"It is self-centered to assume that your play experience is exactly equivalent to OP's"  
---
No, it is ridiculous to believe that he only plays an hour a day and yet some how, against astronomical odds, in any random 16 player server, he is getting griefed by at least one player for absolutely no reason. That this happens every single night, in the brief one hour play time window that he is ever playing in. That griefers are some how synchronized at a celestial level to log in at a specific hour, in such a large volume that joining a game where someone is going to find you and start griefing you for no reason is unavoidable.
---
Yes, they can.   Pacifist mode only applies to you not doing damage to anyone else.  You can still damage their camp and become wanted.  They can still damage your camp and become wanted.  There is going to be an update to where you won't become wanted from a stray bullet until you actually destroy something.
---
“Politely” pretending you don’t understand what you were just told, that your cynicism affects your peer players/redditors, and justifying that dont-care attitude with “realism” has much more toxic impact on an online forum than calling out that exact behavior. 
---
You don’t dump on your living room couch (I hope). Don’t dump here either. 
---
If this game wants realism, then do water consumption accurately. It looks like purified water is 500ml at the very least. We should not have to drink more than 8 purified waters in a 24 hour period. 
---
\&gt;:(
---
A bag?
---
Based on the damage he did do with a off-center target....a target that was more on center, I have no doubt he could have wrecked the rest of it.   He missed one building.  Basically everything else was damaged.  I have 8 water purifiers.  There were 2 left standing but broken.  The rest were just empty concrete blocks.
---
You're right, this sub is a circlejerk...in favor of the game. It's pretty much the only place on the internet you'll find people defending the game. If you go on any other subreddit, or a different gaming forum, or a place like youtube, you'll find people are overwhelmingly negative about the game.
---
If you legitimately believe people are going to look back on the game as anything short of a disaster, you're a lost cause. 
---
I'll try.  I didn't think of moving / placing / storing anything in the heat of the moment, but if it happens again I won't forget to try that.
---
Think it's because it's not really PvP.  It's built on the concept of player factions, in this case people RP'ing raider which by definition means griefer.
---
We'll have to play sometime, then!
---
That is what most people did, but she rarely landed. I also broke my melee weapon fighting off the mobs, so I was kind of forced to go with my guns.
---
Thank you for the suggestion though, I appreciate it!
---
I appreciate it.   Similar has been said already but I appreciate people taking the time to try and come up with something useful as opposed to the "git gud" crap that some people come up with.
---
I've had 2 greifers at my camp. One, a level 30 or something, started tossing enclave grenades and destroyed half my camp before I could log off. The other came out of nowhere and started spraying an exploding heavy weapon. He took it 2 of my industrial purifiers before I logged. My camp is in a pretty decreet location. So, they had to go out of their way to attack my camp.
---
Yeah, this game is still in alpha.
---
Not really.  Most survival games or modes I've done were not pvp.
---
It should at the very least show you all the total resistances.
---
With proper specs and perks, they actually are still pretty potent even before needing star legendary
---
Search:  Moonlight nVidia.  It works really well.   Tip:  Use wired connections where possible.  If not, use wired connection on your "main power house pc" and 5Ghz wireless on your laptop.  Takes very little setup and there are plenty of guides.  I'm sure there are youtube videos on it.  Basically the Moonlight application pretends to be a nVidia Shield but on your computer.
---
Using a headset might require an added bought USB plugin for pretty cheap, but my headset reaches my PC and I also use a bluetooth headset sometimes too, so I don't need to worry about that.   
---
You realize we can all see your post history.... yes... even if you think you've deleted it now.
---
Cobra chickens??
---
Have you encountered a *Cobra monkey* yet?
---
I've had 20 or 30 people at my camp.  Only 1 was a douchenozzle.  I can't expect that of everyone.   Also, I have pacifist on, so I can't really kill him first.
---
I think I had an issue with this one. A relog fixed it for me.
---
What are the lavish dev perks?
---
I would really like to have more room.  Do I absolutely need it, no, but it would reduce the amount of time I spend managing weight.  I hate playing the weight management game which is about 80% of the content right now.
---
what's the 76 stand for?
---
Of course it's the generous reddit user that responds instead of an official employee for Bethesda. Bethesda always relying on community members to do their own work. I thank and applaud you Tyme for helping people when Bethesda could lift their asses and fingers and do their job in "Community management". 
---
I think you have to do it from the first screen.  Before you log in.  I remember it was something weird like that.
---
Are you outside the US? Try using a vpn to set location to US then try the digital code. That worked for me.
---
I have no disagreement there.   Using your camp to kill mobs is great, but Whitesprings is the closest thing there is to a hub...it's too popular of a spot to be putting something like that there.   That's why mine is just outside the fence not actually on Whitesprings, but right next to it.
---
You can just go to the terminal in fort defiance.
---
That looks like some sort of lag ... the mobs arent even registering that you are there and attacking you.
---
It’s in the bos asylum computer
---
It's located on the fourth floor of one of the camps. It's where they hold the event line in the Sand.
---
I did the same thing when I got my power armor from that quest and accidentally scrapped it. On the last patch they made it so you're able to go up to a computer that's up on the fourth floor and learn the recipe. Granted you have to use the materials to rebuild it but at least you can get it back that way.
---
Make a sign?  Use letters.   If you don't have the plans and are on PC, I'll come make them for you.  No cost unless there is some exotic materials being used, then I just need the materials.   I'm all for people having their own version of willing fun.  
---
I leave peoples stuff alone, I only use work benches and stash.  I suppose if I was struggling for water or food I would take some, but my system keeps me well stocked now.
---
I've had the BoS initiate T-60 paint plan a couple of times, plus some rare suits (BoS scribe, scientist, bomber jacket etc). If BoS armor plans are a possible reward then they're very rare.
---
You'll find out more about flux when you complete the main questline.  Just be sure to pay attention to the stuff you do when you get to the bunker / enclave stuff.  It's a ways in.  One of the better quests in the game, I think.
---
\+karma
---
Drop all the non quest hollow tapes. Play the Master tape. Pick the dropped tapes back up. 
---
Am I the only one where that was glitchy AF? Only got loot off of SBQ, nothing else.
---
Store the shower away and bring it out when you need it.  
---
I've ran into a lot of loners, but I have also ran into a lot of cool people that were fun to talk with and trade tips / tricks and "hey did you know xxxx" with.
---
That would be fine, but it is not like food and water is much of an issue with minimal perks and effort.
---
Even FFXIV didn't mess up this badly. The reputation is far, far too tarnished. 
---
This is exactly what came to my mind. 
---
Thank you and that's the best compliment I've had on reddit.  Thank you again.
---
Otherwise, X-01 with Ultracite legs doesn't look too bad. Plenty of people will mod Ultracite shocks cheap.
---
Are you getting more than a standard player without the buff would get? 
---
\---&gt; Yes
---
Also as previously stated;  If you know where they are or stumble across them. They are absolutely in the game.
---
That doesn't mean that the event wasn't created with the underhanded tactic of convincing people to spend Atoms.
---
The reason why I ask is because I do not dc, and if I do, it's rarely. I do get hard crashes, maybe every other day. I also don't use power armor, my weapons and armor are nothing to write home about, and I don't use chems and bobbleheads. The one consistent thing that will crash me is spamming crafting (all the boiled water). I get lag every so often but my game corrects itself. I have no idea what causes the hard crashes though, and that can be the most frustrating. 
---
If the high bounty scraps their legendary weapons and armor from their body and their stash to pay "in kind" for the damage that they do, I think that could be a deterrent or at least if I get back what I lost so I can rebuild my camp easily, then PvP might be kind of fun.
---
It produces quick but has a set limit that it can hold.
---
Fast legendary wins.  Instigating and vampire too.  So whichever drops for you will become your new fave.
---
I fought the Q with a fast vampiric baton.  All my others broke, but i still had a backup to my backup.  :)
---
The limit is 3?
---
As long as people have a window you can get to, there is no need to break a door. Set down you power armor through the window and then get back in it, you will be sucked through the window. You can do this to get outside again, so no breakages. Some windows are big enough, that you can jump through them :)
---
I do not lock my door anymore, as I like windows and do not want to live in a fortress. I have food and water for anyone that walks by my camp, but hard to tell if anyone takes any,  water purifier is always full and crops unpicked.
---
No, but if Fo76 is anything to go by, people are going to be a lot more skeptical of their game releases in the future. With an engine that broken, I doubt they will pass the test for a lot of people.
---
Obviously I don't know with 100% certainty how BGS will go down the line, but I suspect they will run into more and more problems as time goes on.
---
Good bot
---
Thanks, human! ^(Bleep bloop. I am a carcinogenic bot and this is an automated response |) ^[info](http://redd.it/amo7ot)
---
Good point.  I'm with you on that.  The early Whitesprings was brutal.  I found out the hard way a few times.  I guess I don't always learn right away.  (One time I just barely nicked a robot that ran right in front of me while I was attacking a mob.)
---
He meant with the weight reduction perks, 50 is too low for the level cap.
---
But a lapel pin is way too small to base an entire in-game outfit on. At the very least it'd have to be some salvaged pre-war clothing with a patch on the sleeve, or maybe a hat with a patch.
---
 very cool build
---
I haven't played in a while it was 3 for one of them and 5 for the largest back in november.
---
Xbox here.  Someone on another thread said clearing your Xbox cache helps and personally I found this to be true plus it's easy to do.  Turn it off, unplug it for a minute or two, plug it back in.  Even when it's "off" it's still doing stuff.... You can tell because when you unplug it you'll hear the actual hard drive click off.  It will take a lot longer to boot after plugging back in also.
---
Or take away the high cost or ability to lose your camp.  I might be more inclined to screw around if it was somehow worthwhile.  It isn't worth anything right now as is.
---
Why would anyone show respect to a laughable company and their laughable community managers? Their literal job definition is in the name. Community. Management. It seems as if the only thing they've done is tear the community apart. Their laughable responses also don't help much in threads like these with over 1.7k upvotes. Thread author points out some issues with the new update, asks for a response from Bethesda. Their response: "There have been a few threads to this same point, I will continue to report this to the Dev's. Thank you!". Some fucking response alright. They didn't even link the "few threads to this same point" so that we could see an actual response. Laughable company. Laughable community management. Laughable responses. No fucking respect deserved.
---
Mags are very uncommon spawns, given how feeble and random they tend to be....
---
"Bare"
---
1) What platform are you playing on?  PC, i5-6500, 32 gigs of ddr4 ram, gtx 2070, 1tb ssd
---
2) Gamertag/PSN/Bethesda.net account
---
DasGrinch
---
4) Description of the issue - I logged in at Whitesprings, which was nuked.  I put on my hazmat suit immediately to try and not die.  I still died, but then I was severely overencumbered, and could not respawn anywhere but Whitesprings.  Which I couldn't do, because it's a nuke zone.  So I basically had two options, wait an hour or two before I could respawn, or quit out and lose all my junk.  
---
What I actually did is have a friend join the server, join the group, put on his hazmat suit, come to where I was, and then I could respawn on him.  But this is a ridiculous solution to something that shouldn't even be a problem.  Maybe just a 'Hey, that's a nuke zone, so we're going to log you back at vault 76' would be a useful thing.
---
If you bought it recently you might be able to return it. 
---
Nope.  My camp was not in an obnoxious spot at all.  This person came, hang out, played around...and then flattened a large part of it.  In fact, the person that did this had their camp parked right outside the back door of the golf club doing the very thing you are against.
---
I would explain it in great detail however, its forbidden knowledge.
---
Ok thank you.  I'll try that.
---
I've made a grizzly mistake.
---
Epic reply 😂
---
Second this, especially if you have starch genes. Just pay a couple hundred caps for what you want. It's a lot easier than wasting your time trying to randomly get things.  Watch The fallout 76 market subreddit, people are selling them all the time.
---
Yes with full dialogue lines and subtitles but it’s only : mmmffff umpffff mnffhhh
---
 Could make for interesting DLC in the future.  I would enjoy them expanding that faction as well.
---
The industrial will only hold 5...large holds 3.
---
Do you have it locked? Possible someone emptied it
---
Just like when you see a level 1 in the vault - me and another guy fast traveled over there on Sunday and left them 2 nice goodie bags for when they come out.
---
Hell - it's just nice to see new players.....let's be nice to them.
---
Just tagged each one and wait for the experience and loot to drop. :-)
---
How do you lock it? 
---
Have you ever asked a worthwhile question before?  
---
Idk why but they creep me out. Maybe it's all the shuffling and wheezing? I remember my first encounter with them I stumbled upon a small Mole Minor camp and legitimately was like wtf?!
---
Not to mention they always roam in packs.. shotguns galore.
---
This right here!  I wish more people did this.  Once I saw someone doing this I thought I was an idiot for not doing it before.
---
I'm pretty sure one of the community manager said it's a standalone department. 
---
 Of course, adding cosmetic stuff is minor.  Anything they do to the game can have far-reaching effects.   The people fixing what is broken is probably not the people who design simple skins like much of the atom store is.  
---
Just a continuity error.   
---
You wouldn't know a worthwhile question if it bit you in the ass, addlepate
---
OK George, I just want to pet the rabbits. 
---
Not yet, but it’s a requested feature
---
Clearly you have never met the mighty murgle ;)
---
And yet it was. I didn't create it, I only found it.
---
Snallygasters spawn in groups on rare occasions 
---
No, you have to have a friend online so you can target the same instance by joining them for that method to work, but it is the method most people use unless they have a second license / second account AND a second computer (or virtual machine)  OR the other way to do it is to use your friend to hold the stuff and give it back.  That is a pain in the butt too.   Easier to just use a good large general container and do it quickly before the instance crashes...  Some days that works better than others.
---
Each instance's loot table is different.  You can farm stuff from some containers from places that have higher drop rates of particular junk / loot types just by switching servers.
---
Only reason to do it the other way is if you're looking to get most of the mutations imo
---
This right here. Between repairs, ammo and needs, it's getting in the way of the game.
---
If Survival is to BE the game, then we need a Rogue like mode, where our next survivor can get some of the perks or gear of our last one.
---
But if quests and events are to be the game, then get survival out of the way. Not out completely but get it balanced. 
---
I've not had problems killing enemies.
---
There are about 191 perks in the game. Level 1 gets you 7 stats, all level 1. This means at level 85, you will be able to get 84 more stat points, for a total of 91 possible perk slots, which is less than half of the perks currently in the game. 
---
If you think this would render strategy obsolete, then you aren't very creative. 
---
WHY I LOVE THIS SONG
---
They're ok, not fantastically realistic though. I think Dying Light did the best rainy environment, like objects being soaked. I can't remember screen raindroplets.
---
They desperately need a balance pass but then, so does the entire game.
---
They truly are a great new foe.
---
I love them, I need something to really appreciate in this game other than bugs getting fixed 
---
Fair point. I wouldn't mind seeing variations of the suits with faction lapels on though
---
  I will say from now on every time I kill a Moleman  I grant you mercy!
---
Probably wondering who keeps swiping all their bowls
---
It's hit or miss for me.  Sometimes lots of them popping and sometimes nothing at all.  How bout them golfer ghouls though...  Trying to get them since like day 1
---
You can't tame them. Sorry to disappoint you. Maybe in the future they will be. 
---
Disease proc chances are just stupid. Far too high.
---
The game us dangerously close to punishing us for playing.
---
See. I wasn't going mad. My favorite weapon disappeared after the last patch. Nothing major.. just a shotgun with lots of mods and tinkering done to it. No biggie. 
---
That's my faukt then. I acknowledge it.  I'm... Having a libation after a long day.
---
Ok, but that doesn't have much to do with fusion cores being plentiful. If you really wanted to fight somebody, you can just attack anyone who owns a workshop. You don't have to stand around by a fusion core extractor taking them one by one hoping the workshop owner cares about it enough to come and try and stop you.
---
I wish this wooshing people trend would die. You missed the joke, not him this time. Also, people use it to defend jokes that aren't remotely funny  or when they fail to be effectively sarcastic. I just don't get it 
---
&gt;murgle 
---
Oh man. You're right. I have never met Murgle. Is he tame-able?
---
Why would you want to waste your Sugar Bombs?! They are to be worshipped!
---
Wow, no response, what a surprise! Why would I expect a response from Bethesda? Oh, most likely because by the position "Community Manager", I'd assume your job is to interact and develop a strong sense of relationship between you and your PAYING CUSTOMERS. I'm honestly surprised at FloppyGrandmaTitties's generosity in giving a respectful response to your laughable reply. He/she asked for a response to the ability to respec, this is a simple YES/NO/MAYBE-SO answer. He didn't ask if this was a commonly debated topic which makes your "professional" response as a "Community Manager" pointless. Your own words: "There have been a few threads to this same point, I will continue to report this to the Dev's. Thank you!". 
---
This is like someone asking you what time it is and you reply "There have been many people asking me what time it is, but I'm too lazy to look at my fucking watch and tell you the time directly, so a vague *question-dodging* answer will have to suffice."
---
Doubt you would have read this far given your lack of effort into your job, but remember this is your fucking job. Community Management. Interact with the community for fuck sake and give fulfilling answers. We spend our time on posts like these, and it's disrespectful for your response to be that pitiful. 
---
By the way, congratulations on that previous update! Brought a lot of new and old bugs into the game!
---
I wouldn't be keen on paying 60 dollars for a game , play for a few months then be told it will be offline for maintenance for as tear ...I think I'd be a might bit peeved. 
---
You're an idiot.  I'm not complaining about having interactions like this.  I'm complaining about the interactions being completely and 100% pointless.   What is the point of someone being able to do 2000 caps worth of damage to me and they themselves get a 20 cap bounty because they only used one strike to do it.  That isn't PvP... that is bullshit.   Real PvP has consequences for both sides.   Also, this is a Fallout game first.  PvP was NEVER the point of this game, so your claims about knowing the risks and all that other crap is complete and utter bullshit too.  
---
Someone attacking my camp suddenly and without provocation, doing massive amounts of damage that requires specialty shit to fix, is griefing plain and simple.  Your false equivalency based arguments are complete and utter crap.  Come back when you have an actual point to make that you can support with real logic, not this made up crap you dribbled out on the keyboard.
---
And what if he wasn't a cheater and was just crafting a bit to quickly?
---
Does that make you a cheater for quick crafting?
---
Hmmmm.
---
But I need to bulk my items! Sorry cats!
---
I ask this as kindly as possible, but if you've uninstalled the game why are you still frequenting the subreddit? Keeping an eye out for updates and fixes or just having an extra subreddit to screw around on? Genuinely curious. Again, no ill will intended.
---
When a cat drinks, its tongue - which has tiny barbs on it - scoops the liquid up backwards.
---
I decided to try a solo launch as I hadn't done one yet. Broke most of the weapons I took with me, and my armor and power armor. But I got all the way to the end. I activated the keypad to enter the launch code, and the game glitched. My Hud disappeared and I could no longer move around ro do anything. The animations continued in the background and I was able to exit my power armor. But nothing would let me enter the code or back away from the keypad.
---
&gt;For Whitesprings, you also have the ice box outside of the golf club for unwanted legendaries.
---
Yep that is decent place if the whole WS was nuked. Not so great when only the edge of golf club is under nuke.
---
Do it, post a letter like that, 
---
Im not having problems. I consume a lot of different food and drink for their boosts anyway.
---
Username checks out.
---
I mean, it'd be nice if we could have little accessories but the Pipboy inventory system is already such a mess with how armor can be eight separate pieces, plus the cosmetics on top.
---
I usually open all 3 armor frames at once and jump in the one I want then let the other 2 be auto recalled. 
---
I was just plowing through ghouls in the asylum and they would fall to the ground, fall through the ground and transport back to their sleeping position unable to be looted. I feel you OP
---
No unfortunately but rifle gaming did a video where he built a pretty nice base around him seemed neat.
---
Ps4 but damn thank you anyway!! I'm all about fun too, once I get the 9500 caps or whatever I may do jus that! Ya I'd say take a break or jus play short sessions until more content arrives so you dont get too bored or stale from lack of things to do. Currently im wanted for a measly 10 caps but I hope it means I get to have so fun for a few when I log in!!
---
Yeah, but if he's only looking to get those three back then you can probably get that for 500 caps total.
---
20% per hit for miniguns and Gatling lasers, 30% for other autos and 40% for the rest. At least that’s what the .esm says. Seems to proc much less. 
---
I gave up on FO76 after buying 4 copies and getting refunds for 3 of them. I couldn't refund the 4th because I played the game. :\\
---
So claimeth the witless moron.  I've played plenty of games where the PvP has a point.  It is because of these games ranging all the way back to the dialup text M.U.D. days that I have expectations for what PvP should be like.  This isn't PvP.  This is bullshit, you bloviating queef.
---
As someone who is new to all this I understand where he is coming from. I didnt know I needed Gold too in order to play. So how about this... when are the private servers gonna be up so we can play without Gold.
---
bought the game at christmas followed a quest to go into a tunnel came out into watoga, overweight by at least 100 pounds, all the health debuffs (tired, hungry, drunk, too many meds).
---
  Now as I am walking across the creepy red grass all the stuff shooting at me I am barely scratching I am not supposed to be here (everything is at least 5 levels higher than me, and I am doing no damage) . finally make it to the vendor on the map after  a couple times getting shot by the bots. 
---
Scrap my items put into stash which had been 400 pounds I think, now it it magically full. I had no Idea what to do I hear loud footsteps think one of the bots is back to kill me. some  high level angel in beautiful power armor kills the bot trying to kill me and  dropped some food and water and a couple stimpacks and some adhesive into a suitcase walked away into the wasteland just as the warning comes out that a bomb will be dropped....then I disconnected from the  server and  I never got the chance to thank that beautiful kickass in power armor. So thank you &lt;3

I really think the fusion core generator at our camps should be able to recharge a fusion core every 30 minutes or every hour.  Someone else could come by and steal it, so securing the generator somewhere would be a good idea.
---
How did I miss the joke? He said oh like it currently is? And that was literally the joke.
---
Yes
---
No, no. The super mutant with the minigun drops a spiked board.
---
I've tried getting rid of it, but I always end up losing stuff like marsupial, speed demon, or twisted limbs before I lose empath. I just choose to deal with it than to give up good mutations. 
---
There are random spawns in the world that have enemies guarding them, usually robots, that are free.
---
Then there are player summoned ones that are locked and only the owner can take freely.
---
Literally no point in going after SBQ anymore. You'll be using twice as much ammo as you previously were. You'll be using twice as many chems as you previously were. Your weapons armor will degrade twice as fast as they previously were. Literally no point in going after SBQ anymore.
---
Wow, I never thought of that. Pretty clever. Unless it comes out of their caps, then it'd be negated. 
---
I've had this happen to me as well. Seems to come and go - I've also seen it as a skill of 3 when I have two lock picking perks enabled.
---
I'll tell you in a day or two.
---
There are lots of games you can play in the sandbox.  One of my favorites is breaking into people's impenetrable camps and leaving them a sack of fertilizer in their locked rooms.   I'll leave it to you to figure out how to break into people's camps even when they don't have windows by workbenches or windows by beds... but there is a hint on how to get into the easy ones you likely already know.  Still, fun to leave a present behind and make them wonder:  WTF?   Now, if only there was a way to light the paperbag of fertilizer on fire so that it had a nice orange glow to it when they came home to find it...
---
Lots of other games you can play in the wastelands...
---
I hope your wrong jus so they ain't trashin your experience n fun and the higher reward to risk really pays off and keeps em away.  I'm not a pve kinda guy but I shouldn't be salty to those who are so sorry if I seem so. If you in ps4 I'll do free adventure body guard grief cushion lol 
---
I once logged in and got the message that someone's camp was in my spot.  So I decided to check it out.  Tons of water purifiers and other stuff all locked at level three.  However they had an adhesive farm that they weren't properly attending to. So I helped them out and attended to it :-)
---
That's what you get for taking my spot.
---
I have a fusion generator at my camp.  Shouldn't that be able to power up a fusion core pretty quick?  I think so.
---
One of my cats flicks water all over the top of his head as he drinks.  My other cat licks the drops off his head.  Hilarity usually ensues when the flicker inevitably gets dunked on.
---
It also has 0 negative effects, so its basically free damage. 
---
Scrap for ammo components,I'm sure someone already said it but this!!
---
Me too
---
AND, that black titanium scrap 
---
Then stop fighting the queen. It's a waste of time and ammo. If u want guns or armor. Hit one of player shop or search discord or bazaar for items.
---
I kill them quickly because they freak me out so much!
---
Unfortunately too true. 
---
We can always dream
---
So I am leaning more towards your suggestion now, I did some more SBQ fights tonight and when there were less people this didn't happen.
---
I just find it frustrating that you have to work with their wack VATs to become a good sniper. 
---
I constantly reject using vats and it’s really punishing for my character type. I just got a decent instigating pipe rifle the other day so I’m going to see how that goes. 
---
Iseewhatyoudidthere.gif
---
I have noticed they respawn pretty quickly but take a few minutes before they can be harvested again.  Someone may have picked it a bit before you found it.
---
Yeah I've found insane amount of ammo before
---
As an aside, I've become very tired of getting crappy Legendaries from Events in the Mire and Cranberry Bog.  There is no excuse for me to get a Lv. 20 Combat Armor piece when I'm killing Lv. 68 Ghouls, Lv. 40 Gulpers, and I'm Lv. 99.
---
The whole reason I basically avoid events in the Forest, Toxic Valley and Ash Heap is because Legendaries seem capped.  It forces you to turn to the Savage Divide, Mire or Bog.  So, okay, if I'm going to play that little game, Bethesda, then at least be consistent about it.
---
I am a heavy gunner, and found the broadsider a terribly weak weapon, and no fun.
---
I did not see any explosive effect.  Is that from data mining, or some other source?
---
Well it sounds like I need to be creative, damn I wish I was on pc now 
---
Forget about the tse thing.  Or banning dupers. 
---
They've been doing worse than that.   Having reddit posts edited or removed.  Removing posts on their own forum.  Banning users for daring to criticize them. Criticism well earned I might add.  And the game is still buggy as hell.
---
And no,  I haven't been banned. I just don't like what I see going on.
---
Thanks for that, but it isn't enough.  Working on pretty much all the weapons across the board would be a good start.   Please ask the devs to explain how a .50 cal does less damage than a .308.    Considering the materials alone to make a 50cal bullet are an order of magnitude more expensive than .308.  (Hint:  There is a lot more ass behind a .50 cal than a .308 round when you go to make them in real life.   About 6 to 8 times the ballistic energy, too, though I don't have the calculation right in front of me so I may end up being corrected.  It's close to that.)  All the gun weights are ridiculous.  I understand that weight is a limit, but in other posts Bethesda says that they don't want some cards to be "must haves", well all the weight reductions ones are must haves because without them you can't carry anything at all unless you like using power armor all the time with the trade offs that brings.
---
Bottom line:  Weapon balance overall needs a long hard look.  Making thousands of rounds of ammo to be able to go out and kill a SBQ isn't fun at all.   Sending thousands of rounds of ammo is the only way to output enough damage in a reasonable amount of time because what should be larger weapons are all pea shooters.
---
Bring up the build menu and target it.  You should see lock in the lower left corner of the screen.  Same with doors and windows.
---
To be fair, If it’s the people playing the game who aren’t posting you’re doing the assuming about, you can assume they’re playing the game. 
---
No.  You can see on the Fallout wiki a few that haven't released yet, like the Grafton version of today's VTU tracksuit.  They loaded up the Atomic Shop in advance and they are slowly releasing them.
---
How about that last one, walking around, looking at the dead bodies of his friends....
---
 I never liked VATs, I like to shoot shit myself.  I feel your pain,
---
I end up doing the same thing... it’s such a simple problem to fix my endless frustration 
---
I see anglers and mire lurks in groups quite often too.  
---
Mire lurks all day long
---
would be nice to have a "take a penny leave a penny" type container at train stations
---
THAT HAPPENED. Today after I got my x01 shocks mods 
---
I agree, but free shit is nice
---
you down wit OSB?
---
I don't mind some of the higher level / legendary stuff taking more shots, but you're absolutely right, this is ridiculous.  The bullet sponges are insane.     Yet, when I melee that same level 68 glowing one, I can take him out in about 5-8 swings AND half of the time he is knocked on his ass getting back up before I knock him down again so he misses more than half of this attacks during that time...maybe more than 2/3 of his attacks are negated by knocking him on his ass.   
---
These things can take bullets to the face without being knocked on their ass?  Yeah right.
---
I know! Saddest thing. 
---
Damn you fight club rules...
---
I'd like to see both:  Higher durability and lower repair costs.  It should NOT cost more to repair something than it did to make it in the first place.  Ever.
---
AND WE ALL LIFT TOGETHEEEEEEER!
---
I should have added this to my op dam
---
If you want upgrades for the Ultracite PA, just follow up with the Watoga vendor area after a SBQ nuke. Plans are left in the containers constantly.
---
I have about 150 hours, and I agree the state of the game is terrible. I don't think this sub is a circlejerk in favor of the game though. Its basically 50-50 right now on hating or loving it. 
---
You are right in saying people are going to look back on this game as being a disaster. It just happens with every game that has a bad launch now, even if the game is fixed later on.
---
Looks like lag.  I get this all the time.
---
Put down the guns, pick up a machete. 
---
Welcome to 76.

So my vats one shot monkey could be a one shot melee machine too.

This is like internet tough guy bragging but you're bragging about the length of your e-dick and not even about how many guys you've beaten up irl, lmfao 
---
You're completely fucking pathetic
---
that happens, loot will take forever to load but for me the SBQ loaded as soon as she died 
---
No it definitely didn't. I just got 6 in about an hour playtime. 
---
I think slightly southeast of the crash space station there's a spot or I've had five or six sn spawn at once.
---
Yeah idk why they decided to change it from fallout fours system. Like they used the same engine, why change the food and water requirements? It would’ve been less work to just copy it. Then they made condition even more tedious than it was in new vegas or even fo3. I can’t even go into Charleston for thirty minutes without bringing a back up weapon or two because of how fast it all breaks.
---
Disease I haven’t had a huge problem with yet. But I’m sure I will.
---
Rad-x suppress mutations effects.
---
Yeah around there i would agree
---
I would love to be able to scrap ammo and get some spare lead. Or sell ammo I can't/don't use.
---
Power armor and emergency protocols.
---
Patch 5 made everyone throw hussy fits because of the tse nerfs
---
There are SO MANY QOL things that just aren't in the game. It's like the devs never played the game.
---
Wow, that's amazing!! :) 
---
The whole Legendary thing is broken. Kill a 3 star, get a drill. At Whitespring the legendary ghouls have stopped dropping anything about 10 percent of the time. It’s crazy. I loved their “we are aware of the problem” comment in the last Inside the Vault. Well it’s broken because you nerfed to drops two patches ago, or did you forget?  How hard can it be to just undo what you did? Never mind, we already know that is outside your skill set. 
---
i don’t have anything locked and i have a decon arch outside i hope people appreciate it enough to not destroy it because getting more flux to repair it would suck

Space Invaders 1978?
---
I'm 76 years old so I started this stuff at the age of 36 and have never grown up. My first online game was on Compuserve in 1982 at 300 baud for $6 an hour. If we had seen the future and Fallout 76 we would never have believed it.
---
I complain like everyone else, but I also see the miracle of it all.
---
I need to start doing this, I've actually bought bulk ballistic fiber from vendors lately just to repair my armor. Spent the majority of my caps on it.
---
Ahh nice. I have the one for melee weapons and it's awesome. Repairs itself by using it! 
---
I dislike the messy look of partially charged in my inventory. 
---
Yeah I thought the game was supposed to be about rebuilding which implies that eventually you’ll reach a self sustaining point where you can finally quest around without worry. But it’s all just an endless grind and never really ends.
---
How many of these request posts am i gonna see? This is the game, love it or (probably) hate it. Seriously, you guys are shouting into a void.

I have also tried:

dirty tan suit with **bowler hat** combo

dirty tan suit with **bowler** combo
---
Neither combo worked when doing events.
---
Not sure whats wrong.
---
They said they're looking for a fix later in the year lol
---
Owch yeah never do that not worth it I have on average 300+ and never run out just doing a run or two a day maybe
---
And then you get one of them with the missle launcher that fires at point blank range lol 
---
I'm getting this a lot lately when I move my base.  Only solution thus far is to completely disassemble my base and rebuild it. :(
---
Yet - and here is the amazing part - I've had more spontaneous disconnects in the past couple days than I've had in quite some time.
---
You would think with fewer people playing and fewer nukes going off that things would stabilize a bit.
---
My "bowler" no hat, and dirty tan suit combo is working. Try new server?
---
That's fair. I rarely venture into the Ammo tab unless it's to dump all the missiles i always accidentally pick up
---
It is not affected by Heavy Gunner perks at all. I discovered that it is explosive after getting it on my explosive character. Apparently it is also in the official strategy guide. 
---
All the wikis are incorrect. They all copied the Fallout 4 entries and assumed it worked the same way.
---
So, here is the shot of the Broadsider sitting alongside all the other explosive weapons in the launcher category:

I asked my friend for some gauss rifle ammo, the 2mm electro stuff. So he hands over like nearly a thousand and i really didn't need all that. But he seemed really glad it helped so i took them all and dumped hundreds of it behind some nearby bush so he doesn't know.

Damn that's cool!

were any of them named? perhaps its part of the [Mr. Veterinarian random encounter](https://i.imgur.com/BAFBTlz.jpg) but the bot got ganked on the way?  usually has a train of 5-6 kitties behind him
---
My tank build would say other wise.  200  armor nude is great for farming.  
---
You can then stack the Armor to get = PA and i have a LOT of bonus from my Legendary gear, so really i take way less damage.  The only negative is nuke zones, but really 200 armor in a hazard suit is not that bad.
---
I just bulk everything up and sell every resource that is in excess of the threshold of 10 bulk units. The unbulkable ones I keep a stockpile of 100 units.

The limit is 5. IIRC, the production time still doesn't line up, but it's not hugely far off.

It does suck, but you can make a new char.  I did the same with my first, it sucked.  He is now deleted and replaced.

Not if we also increase each Stat max by 5.

I’m sure we’ll see so nice QoL improvements just as the player base sags even lower sadly...
---
I kinda wish we had a boss mole miner similar to a bioshock big daddy
---
The first time I encountered them, I was walking along im Ash Heap and started killing mole rats, then I heard burrowing noises, assumed it was more mole rats and then suddenly I was surrounded. Freaked me right the fuck out. Flash backs to the Ghost People. Later I noticed that the lower level ones cloaks are pinkish, and look a hell of a lot like flayed skin.
---
I dont know which possibility is worse, the skin coming from their human victims in an attempt to "be more human" or the skin coming from their mole rat friends, in an attempt to "be more mole".
---
I do really like the idea that they are children who were trapped in the mines. I could just picture all the disenfranchised miners gathering their families and leading them down into the mines they knew so well in an attempt to escape the bombs. Over time they all started changing, the adults died and the children took up their parent's gear, and sought solace and comfort with the only other inhabitants of the mines: mole rats. Over time, the children became adults, but never knew what it was to be human, they snuck to the surface and would capture more children to replenish their numbers. Perhaps they heard the whispers of something ancient and dreaming-dead, deep beneath the earth. That last part is based on the enormous amount of mole miners in Lucky Hole Mine.
---
Amazing
---
I have way too much gunpowder but not enough lead so this would work really well with my build
---
Actually it doesn't. In my build, an extremely focused rifle build, both the best .308 and the 50. Cal recievers do the same. The thing is the 50. Cal ammo is easier to craft and it makes the gun sound sexier too. 
---
Nah

That is an amazing CAMP and I love that you want to make it into a trading hub.

---
Press F to pay respects...
---
I don't know what the nerf did specifically, but it feels like whenever you have Legendaries gang up, they tend to drop similar Legendaries.  Case in point - what are the odds that I'd get two Tesla Rifles back-to-back with different prefixes?  Out of *all* the weapons in the game, which we're supposed to draw from in theory, the likelihood of getting the *same* one?  I don't buy it.
---
That’s your actual dlc people 
---
There's no possible way this also won't be exploited you idiot
---
I can't believe anyone would say fo76 was well received at launch. It was absolutely horrible with visual glitches and broken quest lines. You said the game has improved, that implies that at first it needed improvement, yet here you are saying that it's bullshit peddled by people who didn't play the game. You are talking in circles
---
Beth is looking at these, they’ve implemented some of our ideas, hold hope my child, you shall see the sun next day.

---
Whatcha need bud? Also,  what platform? 
---
she died an hour ago man 
---
Nukes? Not really. On my heavy weapons guy with demolitions my fatman does like 900 damage I think. But after you consider reload time, ammo weight and all the other disadvantages to it (like no penetration perks and needs repair often) it's quite sub par dps. Not to mention how unwieldy it is. It's straight not useful except in the most fringe cases and with as much inventory cost that comes with it, you'd have to be an idiot or dedicated to role playing to even consider using them.
---
Then they'd add a new survival bar

Thanks guys/gals/etc!

Was it alive? Or a statue
---
I have so much surplus ammo. I literally only use 556 and 308, it would be a god send to break down the others to make more. 
---
I can agree with that my dilemma is that in the other games interacting with other survivors, getting quests from them and having a world full of Raiders, Gouls and other monsters made the world feel more full.
---
Especially the Raiders, just ppl out there trying to survive just like you but the dark side, not what you’d find in a city.
---
No quest npcs is understandable I guess (aside from robots) I mean that was their design decision for the game
---
No raiders in this game makes me feel the whole “not an actual fallout game” the world just doesn’t feel true to what the franchise did so well in some areas
---
As a fellow old sk00l gamer (Oregon Trails and Choplifter on Apple ][ for me) and veteran of the glorious ups and downs of WoW starting in alpha, you have a good point about stability in a AAA online game not always starting off so well...
---
... that said, WoW had CONTENT. Tons of it. And while lag made me want to quit numerous times this first few months (Archimonde was especially awful... 5 minute loot lag at 2am?!?!) we didn't have the wealth fundamentally broken systems we see in Fallout 76.
---
You may be silent and possibly even the majority (though I find that rather dubious given the almost insane instability this game has on the most basic level), that doesn't mitigate just how badly the launch has been botched.
---
The only thing more pathetic than Fallout 76 fanboys are console fanboys playing Fallout 76 using Fallout 76 as another front to flog how they've welded their egos to their toy computer of choice
---
R u still down for it
---
*obviously not played anything massively multiplayer, ever
---
1/15 of my Fo76 friends still play, we'll see if the game lasts that long to see those QoL changes
---
It's just riding their coattails and trying to cash into the genre, though
---
It was a statue.

Yeah me too. It's still annoying as shit. 
---
I had this problem plenty of times too, combined with the never ending spinning wheel when waiting for loot.
---
She can also quickly turn into a meat pile identical to the 400 other meat piles on the ground, making it literally looking for a needle in a haystack when you want your loot.
---
&gt;Congrats, a loophole an extreme minority of players might use.
---
The extreme minority of players who would abuse it are the people you're whining about. 
---
People bitched about people camping whitespring's golf club with turrets.  Now you're advocating for a way to make it so the turrets are completely untouchable.  I don't think they'd like your idea either. 
---
&gt;It's still better than the bs system in place now.
---
No. It's not. Your idea sucks on so many levels. 
---
I like the idea, but its too much, Make it 55 and give each special a cap of 18. If you're going to load certain special attributes with 1/2 of what a build needs to be successful then don't then lock us out of all of that. It doesn't force us to make meaningful choices, it makes certain builds less viable compared to say rifle+crit/vats. Like a pistol+crit/vats for instance. Or heavy weapons with more perks in the str tree than you can even fucking take. Whats with that?
---
You're forgetting damage types and resistance though because not all damage is equal. Ballistic being the highest resistance most people have but many enemies just have high nuke damage resistance but for creatures that don't, it's pretty damaging. 
---
They all seem to carry toys as well. Are they kids? Is this a hate crime? 
---
Since the last pc patch, it seems the scorched queen body upon death, will drop, and the last 2 of 3 times, the body has just disapeared maybe 30 seconds after drop for everyone and no loot was able to be had. This has happened to me the last 2 of 3 scorched queen fights. There has also been issues where she just flys way out past the boarder east and just stays out of range and never returns. Then another issue with her I have run into is her body landing past the border and people are unable to retreive anything.
---
You have 76 upvotes... This man is a secret Bethesda agent! 
---
I will take any weightless wood or unyielding wood armor you get lol
---
Yep. I’ve did the same. My first was a bit of everything but at level 45 I realised i couldn’t get the final weapon modding perks. 
---
Very nice.
---
Where you running Mods?
---
Always check out suitcases or cash registers near vendors. Eventually vendor run out of caps and you can't sell ammo you don't want.
---
Watoga train station after a SBQ fight is always the best.
---
Well thank you, I didn't know lol ,I wish they would have like a rarity percentage so you can tell
---
That could have went better...
---
A lot of people where hiding or standing around. I gave up around the 10 min mark once I saw that.
---
You are both right.  The design is incredibly shallow.
---
I look at it like this. I can spend 5-10 extra minutes actually combing a dungeon, or just automatically grab anything in an ammo crate and deal with it later. I'd rather play inventory manager than picky scrapper, but neither aspect is fun or adds a challenge, it just slows me down.
---
So I don't mind the barrage of posts suggesting shit, because TBH, the very foundation of this game (survival) is doodoo garbage. And so few people have played survival difficulty through on NV and 4, that now we're seeing the backlash of forcing everyone to suffer through nonsense weight management.
---
Because that's how you play any fallout game. I'm playing this one like I played the others. I'm not into PvP so I don't need to see anyone. If I do it's either a friend who I'm playing with or trying to help a lower level. Not going to mark myself on the map so some asshat can do this. I play on Xbox and haven't seen this happen really but I'm always prepared. 
---
Jesus christ, by these definitions of griefer people seem to be throwing around, I was "griefed" by my cat last night.
---
My impression from a handful of fights was that you have a limited window in which to re-target the Flatwoods monster after he teleports before he disappears entirely.
---
How long you been subbed? I have been since release, when i got the game, and there have been countless requests voted to the top of this sub that have cried out for the ability to scrap or do something with all their excess ammo. COUNTLESS. Not to mention all the other ideas/requests about what to implement in the game.
---
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news father, but all hope has faded. The last patch saw to that. This game is broken and all bethesdas horses and all bethesdas men couldn't put fallout 76 together again. 
---
How many pages deep in my post history did you have to go before you were able to copy that response?
---
You need to defend your stance not challenge others to explain how you didnt use your reading comprehension.
---
It so happens I found my first piece of Weightless Wood armor today, but it was at Whitesprings. I threw it out, but I will keep an eye out for you! 
---
While I agree with you 100%, selling ammo even if it's just one cap per bullet would just empty out the vendors even faster. I think first they need to raise the vendor cap limit then talked about all of us being able to sell our ammo.  Shoot Ive probably dropped 5-7k in ammo.  You'd never be able to sell weapons or armor on top of ammo.  At least not with the 1400 cap limit per day.  That's why my stash is full.  Because I don't have enough vendors to sell to per day.  
---
Now scrapping it to produce more ammo of different types, that should happen yesterday!
---
i will keep an eye on it, however if its going to act like the flowers weekly and not count it, well lets just say i wont be surprised.
---
You paid 60$ for a new, empty map for Fallout 4
---
Lol why throw it out, if you put shrouded on it, i weighs straight up zero
---
text chat would  be tedious for ps4..with no keyboard it would be slow..id probably get eaten by a ghoul while typing..i dont know why people cant just use their mic..or go buy one..ps4 has a built in mic i  the controller which is handy.
---
It just works.
---
Yeah the flower thing happened to me too.. But sometimes when I switched server I could see progress then it'd go away
---
PS4. Anything to make the game playable again, better weapons I suppose. I logged out tonight feeling like I was done with it, but I really enjoy playing it.  For being level 41 I feel more overpowered now than I did at level 5.
---
...... Why do you have two?
---
Thanks!
---
Most of their challenges seem to not include a lot of things that common sense would say should be included.
---
Filthy casual.
---
It wasn't the build I was going for, I was looking for Weightless Combat armor, so I just threw it out without thinking about it.
---
Nope. I ended up having to uninstall and then reinstall the launcher to get the game to play. 
---
There are a hundred ideas on this sub at least.  But Beth has not spoken about more than few of them, and that some time ago with no specifics.
---
A roadmap is a key starting point.
---
At one point i had a few thousand 10mm ammo that took a good amount of space for me to become overencumbered
---
Honestly until the damage is far better for the mini nukes and missiles, ect.  I just drop them, sometimes I will have fun. I sell any missile launcher, granade launcher, or fat man I get. Sometimes I will drop those in containers along with other items I don't use or have too much of. If others can use them...great. 
---
Lmao im totally doing this to the next person who has locked doors. 
---
I got verified December 12th and just got my atoms email. That canvas bag will be so nice in time for the next presidential election. 
---
I was at Army Camp McClintock one time completing the mission there. Was checking out the building and looked in the lockers. I don't know who did this or if was even intentional, but made my day. I hit the Jack Pot! Got myself a couple of nice weapons too. Now I am stocked on purified water, stimpaks, Nuka-Cola's, etc. Have my stash is full of Quantum's, Cola's and Cherry hahah
---
Global text chat was what I was thinking.  "I want to launch a nuke, can someone help?" But that's not my main point. If you're in a silo, would you mind if someone else came in to help get the nuke launched?
---
I had the same video sent to me and so I did a little testing in how useful it really is.
---
[https://youtu.be/0rmGzG23nt0](https://youtu.be/0rmGzG23nt0)
---
Hahaha, glad you like it.  Based on a lot of reader reactions to the post itself, I think it might be getting some karma for the wrong reasons.
---
900 plus hours with all the server disconnects we get.... you must have the patience of a saint. 
---
i wouldnt mind at all.
---
I've played Far Cry 2. I'd much rather prefer my guns to actually function when the game says they're not broken.
---
How it's bf5 . Haven been considering it.
---
Nope, try Monongh...
---
Honestly, we need a fast semi auto pistol with decent damage and low AP use. The issue with the revolvers is that they are so slow to fire and reload but don't give a decent AP advantage over rifles.
---
Hey - if you didn't buy them already I have one Mod that I'll sell you for 500 caps. Bought an extra mod the other day by accident. Really wish there was a stash box in the bunker so I could double check before I buy X-01 mods.
---
That’s like selling a new car without wheels, then claiming that the wheels are a free add-on. 
---
Actually, I crafted arrows and jewelry.  Also, Iron War Axes give more for the amount of materials used.  Iron Daggers however, were better for enchanting with Banish to sell, using Petty Soul Gems and minimum crafting materials.
---
I was thinking turn 10 .38 into a bundle to sell for a cap, a 10 of 5.56 for 5 or something small.
---
The BoS vendor in Watoga. He's in the Super Duper Mart in the Shopping Plaza.
---
on point
---
No counter?
---
Have you done Harper's ferry. 
---
Early on… scary as fuck. Now… my favorite enemy! Always a fun time.  
---
Bloody mess
---
I like to visit people's camps. It's fun to see the different ideas and structures. Most of the time I go to a camp, it's usually to repair guns or armor. 100% of the time players don't mind. I usually give a thumbs up emoji to show em it's awesome and thank you for letting use your camp. 
---
No, but a buddy said it was a let down. Monongh is nice because you can claim the power plant to bring in waves of creatures and there is a ton of flux.
---
Check to make sure they’re plenty ghouls then nuke.  But morgantown has plenty ghouls, and monogah has plenty mole miners
---
I keep trying to tell people this but they enjoy it I guess. My explosive guns are always going to farm faster than anything bloodied. 
---
Bloodied is to kill queens quickly. Total overkill everywhere else. 
---
The cap is now at 56 not 50.
---
Well put!
---
This game is meant to be an innovation on the fallout franchise, like ESO to Elder Scrolls. The point of attacking someone's camp is FUN. It is fun to engage in interactions with others, besides and also including trading, etc. You were too weak to defend yourself. Guess what? That happens against any PvE enemy, and they have a good chance of destroying whatever any human player is capable of. Raiders existed in all other Fallout games, and they attacked your settlements in Fallout 4, so there really shouldn't be any debate here. Human players are meant to be the replacement to NPCs, and that includes raiders. So why don't you watch your tone and stop being so insulting when I am merely stating fact here, and you are bitching about having your repairable things broken?
---
I mind b/c if doing the queen, i want station delta out of the nukezone.  Most of the time, people just nuke it all.  
---
Actually, there have been several notable art problems with cosmetics: glitching around armor, removing underarmor, etc.  So, no, they have not been immune from the categorical problem of QA.
---
We get your point that those art skills are not transferrable to other programming.  But it looks bad.  It rubs many people the wrong way to charge for stuff that might(?) work, when we are waiting for the stuff we already paid for to work stably.
---
And those artists could be working on fun content that isn’t behind a paywall, right?  Would not hurt to deliver goodies to the customers while they are waiting.  They could add weekly cosmetics that don’t cost atoms.  It is not a crazy notion, especially since things have gone so poorly.
---
I did the mole miner at monogah it was uneventful the loot was pretty low level was hoping the mire would make better enemies.
---
Do you want something in particular for it ?
---
Just an offer 
---
I'm on PS4. Happy to help you. PSN dtb7591
---
I'm sorry but that's a big low ball my man. I don't know how serious you are about buying them. 
---
My friends use Grafton a lot. I clear Harper's ferry for weapons, with scrapper it's like 300 steel and some rubber and wood.
---
Should be a minigame.... 
---
Swole Miners... ok I’ll leave now.
---
It has a picture of a PIE as it's crafted item!
---
Ya dude, it’s just a high risk for low reward build.  Totally right with dying a lot. 
---
Only good with power armor, uh huh. 
---
I love when I'm juggling 4 PAs, and it re-orders the same-name PA in your pip-boy. It's like rolling PA dice.
---
That's what I thought at first but then I was like ok I can just do the game myself by throwing throwable knives at it and they will stick to it.. nope 
---
That's not under handed, its smart salesmanship. Give them the opportunity to work for it or buy it or used their atom points they worked for to buy it. 3 options, all fair, but only 1 of them helps pay for future developments.
---
You do realise for this game to grow for years people need to buy atoms right?
---
Also its a temporary advantage before and not during any endgame or competitive content. I personally love the idea of loggin in 1 week to find the cultist uniform i randomly found and saved will give me a chance to summon him instead of the mysterious stranger without a perk card, and others have a chance to join me quickly if they wanna spend the cash. (No this is not a real thing yet, but i hope they read this and make it a week theme)
---
Extremely doubtful.  The cheaters are only people who have been identified with tens of thousands of items or materials that they couldn't have realistically acquired.  Why do you just automatically assume he's not lying?
---
I had to quit to the main screen and reload
---
They oughta just double down on the fact that they’re mole men and give us an expansion taking us deep underground to the Kingdom of the Mole Miners where we eventually get crowned Kings or Queens of the Mole People.
---
How about throwing tomohawks? 
---
Sad thing is I read that perfectly in tune.
---
Just one run at Hornright testing site 3 can get you several hundred of steel and lead
---
I agree, along with the Pool Table should be a minigame, but they never said it WAS a minigame.  Maybe a future update, but I'd rather they work on quality stuff before adding minigames.
---
I did notice that hat, didn't think much of it. It would suck if building prevented it from spawning... that said, I bet only 1/1000 people will actually build on a graveyard. xD
---
Great point! I like to leave V9 out with as much room to spare as possible, but I'm cool with Delta being left out too. Drives me nuts when people nuke it all.
---
 I only spend my in game earned atom on limited time apparel or power armor paint. I knew they will troll you with camp stuff lol 
---
Were you in power armor while wearing it?  I think if your'e in PA it doesn't count even if it shows equipped on you.
---
Secondly why are you and so many treating this game like its competitive when its not and that would be completely counterintuitive to its nature.
---
If you wanna race for world first play something like WoW or GW2 or FF14. It would more fit your style. I was top Paladin of ky faction on my server before this game dropped and i am loving the pace change. I don't feel like i have to log in every moment of every day to keep up.  If i want to play and grow i can, but nobody will ever have a huge edge on me.
---
Reactive plates never once worked for me in excavator.  
---
You don't Have to look it up online, it's just WAY easier than the actual method so essentially everyone just looks up the codes. 
---
I just bought em sorry 
---
I don’t have that piece :/
---
Whatever game this is from has nice graphics! 
---
Yes. That is correct young Jedi.
---
Boycott this shitty fkin game already!
---
r/FO76FilthyCasuals has a great Discord
---
Who fires it?
---
Honestly they should make it undroppable and 93% of it should be defective to a point of ripping through the durability of your gun to a point of being unable to repair it or just a dud and unable to be fired but, it’s  re-added to your inventory randomly and back into your ammo stores to be loaded into your weapons.
---
I've never really understood why they didn't do this with FO4, seemed like a no brainer to me... 
---
Well, another thing for the ever growing wish list ;)
---
Patch 76 perhaps?
---
:)
---
A generator... I just have to throw the artys flare and watch the show 
---
No.  
---
I'm curious how we'd actually make things lighter by wrapping it in plastic.
---
I haven’t played in over a month.
---
Is it limited time?
---
What changes from **PC:** 1.0.4.13 are still missing in  **PC:** 1.0.5.14, if any?
---
**PC:** 1.0.4.13 included:
---
 **Bobby Pins**: Reduced the weight value of Bobby Pins from 0.1 to 0.001. 
---
 **Systems**: Fixed an issue that allowed armor mods to reduce carry weight past intended values 
---
These changed were reported as reverted in **PC:**  1.0.5.10, so it was assumed there was a mistake and they patched an earlier code branch. 
---
The latest hotfix did include the bobby pin changes but did it also included everything else we've had in the past?
---

---
Oh, it comes out of their caps. But since they are bountying each other, it’s negated. It’s not a way to gain free caps, it’s a way to grief based and not risk losing anything.
---
Actually this was found in from a future patch image folder. The devs will hear about this
---
I had one for awhile but eventually ditched it in favour of more CAMP decorations. It's fun, and I'll probably end up using it again in the future but currently I just want an aesthetically pleasing base.
---
Wow!  Totally unexpected.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
I don’t have demo expert, but my explosive dragon makes a big showy flash.  Broadsider just lamely thudded for me, saw no flash or splash.  Is that leftover from FO4?
---
I've decorated mine and my husband's camp as well as a few friends. I love doing it. I spend almost all my caps on camp plans and used to hop servers hoping to find more rare camp plans. I'm on xbox and I believe there could be a market for it. 
---
Or you could just take pa and free up a number of perk points
---
Tanks!
---
Unlimited trash
---
That's 30 minutes of effort for a one word response from you. I'll pass.
---
is there any sweet holes in the ground that need-a-suckin?
---
Like I said, ranged weapons need a buff.  They thought it was important to bring white knight in line with power patcher (only they didn't, I know).  IMO it's more important to bring ranged weapons in line with melee.  And to make pistols viable.  I actually feel sorry for anyone who tried to make a gunslinger build. Pistol lovers have it worse than anyone.  
---
Absolutely, especially when your in a building and there they are, raindrops on the visor.  Super realistic.
---
&gt; couldn’t get the final weapon modding perks
---
Why not?
---
Have you played this game?
---
Wendigos spawn with ghouls
---
No oxygen for are sugar bombs to breath in.
---
Duuuuh
---
They probably don't eat as they're somewhere between human, mutant and ghoul, they probably don't use the bathroom and have most likely befouled their protective suits multiple times over the years, and they probably don't communicate with each other as they only seem to be capable of grunts and screams.
---
Their lives suck.
---
Major buff. The distance is so minuscule. I get why but at the same time so is the orbital strike which isn’t much different. They’re underpowered just different spaces. 
---
You guys didn’t even read the post? 😂
---
Bullet holes from a specific gun maybe? Replace board each turn?
---
I have never seen empty white springs or enemy lower then 45 there, mostly 65
---
&gt; plan for a build from Level 1 on
---
Considering that the game doesn’t show you cards above your level that you haven’t unlocked yet, how are people making these plans anyway?  Spending time offline studying doesn’t sound fun haha
---
"isn't unplayable?" So it is playable.
---
&gt;2. I can't godmode!
---
Yeah, tough shit kiddo.
---
Yeah ... that’s what I wrote in the discussion. I realize we don’t actually make items lighter. But it’s easier to carry a packaged item than the individual components of the package, right? 
---
The game labels the metric “weight” but more accurately it’s a combination of weight and total volume that actually makes things easy or hard to carry. Have you ever picked up several of those cooking pots and thought, “I’m sure glad I don’t have to carry all of these in real life”. The weight is not the problem, but it would more difficult to carry, which is the bottom line.
---
I’m suggesting, making the term “weight” reflect both volume and weight together, which makes more sense in the real world. This would be easier than adding another aspect of each of these items, volume. Make sense?
---
Then clearly you cant❤️
---
Railway rifle or the harpoon gun would both work for this. 
---
ok
---
Is your character name Jackass by any chance
---
Love the glitch good vid man
---
I also get bugs, rats, wolves, and zillions of molerats.
---
(Yes I would like to see the less common ones more.). Sloths.  Hermits.  Cryptids in general.
---
Dope. I can give you a 2-shot drill for it
---
Same way as 76 itself: Just don't.
---
Until proven guilty with proof is my motto.  I've had friends banned for quickly crafting bullets, because apparently its game breaking to do so.
---
I suspect it’s partially due to too many people hunting in the same areas. The legendaries just don’t respawn fast enough to meet the demand. 
---
hAve yOU plaYed tHis gAme?
---
Crossbow maybe?
---
Try the railway rifle or the harpoon gun. 
---
https://imgur.com/KmzLLEd
---
Supposed to be by design but it's not. I reported it.
---
I think the point of the video was to build a base that was "un-fuckwittable" if you catch my drift, all those open spaces you can still be scoped from and you can destroy stairs. using foundations they can't do damage to you or your base (or its contents) 
---
I don't disagree that this is an unfun scenario, my point was just that getting angry at this game for having unfettered PvP is like getting angry at it for requiring you to eat food and drink water. It comes with the territory.
---
Lucky you are on PC
---
Lmao. If you check my post history I'd vastly prefer full open PVP.
---
Yes, there is loopholes with an on/off switch system, but the current system is fucked on so many levels already anyway. This way would at least save people who only want PVE the problem of having their shit wrecked by glitching douches.
---
I don’t have either of these and cannot test ATM. Crossbow doesn’t seem to work 
---
Good to know. It seemed like that was an intended consequence of bulking, not just for selling items to vendors. 
---
This is the very reason I haven't bulked any junk yet. It should reduce weight for all scrap across the board but it's so complicated at this point with different materials increasing weight when bulked plus bugs (which may have been fixed) that I'm fine just dealing with the extra weight without "bulking." They should make it at least a 25% reduction in weight for ALL scrap materials that are bulked. But ^what^^do^^^I^^^^know
---
Seems like nope, just tried 
---
Cannibarrel Perk: the ability to eat ammo. 
---
Pretty sure the watoga train station sells the plans for these. 
---
You probably have too many holotapes in your inventory. Just drop all your non quest holos in your stash or on the ground and it will load properly for you.
---
yeah, people in comments talk about how it is supposed to work. They say, ahh it works for aluminum or whatever.
---
The screenshot clearly shows the expected behaviour and design of the mechanic. 
---
Expected: Bulking reduces overall weight, and enable the sale of junk. 
---
Why would you even ask that? Because he's complaining about bullet sponges?  In 3, New Vegas and 4, bullet sponges were not inevitable. 
---
Those games had difficulty settings. 
---
No, it's not a challenge on easy and very easy, some would say they aren't a challenge on normal difficulty.  The point is that in those games, if you struggled, there was a way to make it easier. 
---
Not sure, it is definitely not flashy.
---
Been using it to clear Whitespring and found something else pretty amazing about it.
---
It appears to naturally have near 100% cripple chance. I can cut the legs off entire packs of level 62 charred ghouls with 1 shot and they just crawl at me. Second shot kills.
---
Really need to find the multi-shot canister or find someone to craft it for me. The multi-shot canister gives it a 3 bullet clip.
---
Im not sure why i need flux for a fucking orbital strike beacon. Balance you could say so players dont spam that on others but realistically...It doesn't make sense
---
Then just go to flatwoods and donate some of the rockets/anything to the overseers box? It helps the community and it isn't wasteful problem solved. 
---
I use more than that in a week. 
---
Oh absolutely. But it’s a..*ahem* smaller price to pay for absolute destruction. Paying for the mobility as opposed to the short short range of the mortar. 
---
not perfect, but a good idea. thanks!
---
I'm talking about his suggestion for changes, or asking why some things aren't how he suggests they should be. Most of those things existed before, and it seems like he hasn't played those games, since he mentioned those things like new.
---
Yeah true i suppose 
---
Conservation of mass?
---
It’s solution only for stackable items. Non stackable items still use RefID in this case. But what structure should hold data for stackable items? Something like dictionary when key is container ID and value is another dict when key is stack ID and value is quantity?
---
I would have taken your stuff and hopped servers
---
Thankfully, I noticed the search function for ammo scrounger pretty immediately and learnt this mechanic for all "Search" perks. 
---
But you are definitely not the first or the last to learn this fact late into their gameplay.
---
Best zone people were doing when the game first came out was vault tec university in Morgantown. Also has insane amount of glowing ones and flora but not as fluid as white spring 
---
Unpopular opinion.  Don't touch pick lock nor hacking.  I see several posts going on about how to keep it at 50 to specialize and have unique builds but then just toss aside these two perks as not counting.  These are not required for game play...you can choose not pick them up.  Youre going to leave some loot behind but youre not some cyber thief.  In many cases you can get the same loot using one or the other.
---
Ive always wondered, whats with the gravestone that has an "activate" prompt there? Is it part of a quest?
---
Yeah kind of...ish Lol.
---
I think it would be nice but I'm thinking bulking is just for selling stuff.
---
Then again, in the vein of immersion, why would a bot magically value our wrapped junk lol.
---
This has been an issue since day one for me, especially on the piles of radioactive goo
---
Its been buggy for a long while
---
Trapqueens is active every day
---
How are you saying it's not an advantage during endgame or competitive content?
---
Does this buff remove itself when you initiate pvp? Does it remove itself when you do a silo run or a SBQ fight?
---
Attorneys General
---
That sucks. 
---
I usually log off after finding a bed. I sleep, get the Well Rested and log off, so that the next time I play, I have the buff active.
---
Where are you getting the idea that people are treating this game like it's competitive? 
---
Also no one cares what you did in WoW.
---
You’re getting downvoted but nobody has replied to you to explain: they come out every week. The last one was last Thursday, and then the Thursday before that. It seems they’ve settled into Thursday but they weren’t as consistent when they started. 
---
For X-01 ? Don’t hold your breath mate. If i find one it’ll go on my right leg and i aint stepping in the Enclave ever again
---
I’m glad I’m not the only TP hoarder.  
---
It should be taken off and people should be given a refund whilst they work on fixing it. if they want to release a broken piece of shit, Bethesda should face the consequences.
---
Sad thing is even if 76 was taken offline for 1 year for it to be fixed, it still wouldn't make the game good. It's broken from the ground up and no amount of polish is going to turn 76 into something I'd willingly spend money on.
---
&gt; Lmao. If you check my post history...
---
&gt;
---
Rofl. You had just called me out for not reading past the first sentence of your idea post. Do you honestly expect me to click on your username and look through your comment history?
---
Are you sure it wasn't Gonorrhea?
---
I like the example of being broken is being unable to exploit a low level zone for loot and xp.
---
It will never happen but within a week of pacifist mode making your CAMP immune to damage I guarantee we would see posts like this:  came across this random guys CAMP and everything seemed fine, was breaking stuff down at a workbench when he randomly built walls that jailed me in one square of his CAMP, "funny joke" I thought but apparently there was a radroach near by so I cant fast travel with enemies near by and the guy is in pacifist so I cant take the bounty and shoot my way out.  Betheada really should have seen this potential and allowed us to still hurt CAMP objects in pacifist, do they not play online games ever? Sheesh.
---
Read the discussion. I’m saying “weight” is the wrong word to begin with. 
---
Griefing will increase when people run out of things to do and boredom sets in. Pretty much everyone has run out of things to do that’s been playing since day 1
---
Batteries incl int perk if youre using energy ammo/fusion cores. 2mm is heavy without it.
---
You’re the reason the downvote button exists. Absolutely not helpful 
---
Same here, and it’s not just that one. It seems to be when I’m around other people, and I haven’t been in a party since the patch. And since the targeting power armor mod highlights for people around you, I’ve been kinda wondering if a lot of these perks and effects are shared with anyone in the vicinity. 
---
Yes, I dropped a Quad.  Alas.
---
Yeah. Getting a perfect legendary should be a grind, but getting a build-relevant high-level one star seems slower than it should be. So much legendary wood armor and RNG abounds. 
---
I don’t know if it’s the loot tables or relative lack of legendary foes. They seem farmed out. 
---
Or it could be that with every patch I always hoped for some substantial fixes, but 3 months in and 
---
Energy weapons are still unusable 
---
90% of the heavy weapons aren't worth using
---
Balancing is shit since the only way to kill things and not get a headache in the end game is melee
---
Performance is shoddy at best even on really good systems
---
Multiple bugs that have been around since the beta still haven't been fixed
---
The lack of even the most basic options (HUD color, UI size, AA/AO, complete key binding)
---
And I really could go on and on but I'll spare you. I defended this game and stuck by it for 3 months, while youtube was imploding in on itself I was optimistic hoping that with enough patches this game will get fixed, but what I got instead was a dozen fixes and a few dozen new bugs.
---
I'm still hoping that one day this game will get its bugs ironed out, but until then me and many others are moving on and given enough time, so will you.
---
Omg, you monster
---
Not according to the shop images. Im fine without a mask so I can wear other things on my head. Right now I wear a bowler hat and sunglasses.
---
Easy fix (at least conceptually easy): Make it so you can bulk ammo, and the bulk packages can be sold. 
---
Look at the post from u/debuggedrobot below. It looks like it was always the intention of the designers to decrease the amount of stash space taken up by bulked items.
---
Jesus Christ my eyes
---
I was about to comment something related to the fat man, before realizing mine is a two shot legendary and my experience is far different from anyone else’s.. 
---
He must be lying then /s
---
Would the Vox Syringer work on them?
---
\[PS4\] Mayor for a day quest is bugged.  As you get to the saboteurs hide out you have to collect 5/5 evidence.  The first 3 are easy but the item on the body will not fulfill the quest, I now have 22 in my inventory I can not get rid of.  As you pick it up there will always be 4 on the body, as well as the contents of the safe.  It will just show 4 of the same item but no quest check off, so you are stuck at 3/5 only once after 4 server hops did it allow me to pick up the item off of the body and count it as 4/5.
---
Weight is relative to the acceleration of gravity, which is generally considered a constant for almost all practical purposes. Weight to mass is a simple conversion and you’re just arguing semantics!
---
Yeah wtf? The difference between the two is dog and cat...
---
It’s totally not. Someone offers to sell you a gun for a 1,000 caps without you knowing it’s duped. You buy it and get banned. Is that fair? Should you never buy anything ever again?
---
If its not competitive to you why are you upset at small advantages. Its inferred from your comments.
---
&gt;Whitesprings is pretty much the only locations worth farming.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Reply
---
This is absolutely true, and the longer you play the game, the more bizarre this seems as a game design choice.  Watoga and the cranberry bog are high- level, end game portions of the map.  In that region, I routinely get legendary drops that are vastly inferior to a region of the map that is early to mid- game? 
---

Thank you very much! 
---
Thank you, I didn't know that.
---
I kinda did this last night, I wandered up to the ammo workshop because I hadn't explored that area yet. Someone had taken over it already and I was just checking it out. I found the ammo forge and picked the lock on it and helped myself to some of that sweet ammo because I was pretty much out and it was the type I needed. I didn't realize I had become wanted but managed to sneak out without a problem. The owner immediately sent me a party invite and I declined because I was worried about him griefing my camp. I kept playing hoping he would hunt me down but never did. I felt kinda bad about it at first but that's also part of the game. I didn't destroy anything, just took the ammo and moved on. 
---
Pre ordered this game and played a bit when it first came out.  The mechanics didn’t feel like old fallout games so I stopped playing because of that and because there were so many other amazing games released around that time. Recently started exploring this subreddit on tips and tricks to help me get started again seeing that people are ridiculously high levels now compared to my measly 17 lol. But I’ve found more hate towards this game from unbalanced bullshit and it makes me really sad. :/ don’t know why Bethesda hasn’t tried to fix it by now but this game just isn’t enjoyable starting up. Quite upset I wasted my money on this game and the tricentennial edition.

Good question
---
You’re doing the Lords work. Bless you 
---
If you are unresponsive for 3-4 minutes, that is more than enough to assume the connection is no longer any good.
---
Its as much of an edge as a buff out and some damage res. You are picking and choosing small parts from my responses to attack separately when they are part if a whole message. This conversation is no longer worth having. You dont want to discuss. You want to attack. Its over. 
---
Probably disconnect half way through with our luck.
---
I'm currently trying to think of games to be made at camps. People can play chess, tic tac toe, I'm working on if logic puzzles are possible, and I've got a cool idea for a riddle house. You could make an obstacle course. If anyone has some ideas let me know because I want to make a puzzle/game trading camp.
---
thanks!
---
Yes, but only if you can solve level 3 terminals quickly, and bring circuits and steel to make mainframe cores. I prefer to use as little ammo as possible and make the turrets do 80% of the work. I just want to get in and get out. The groups I have done runs with either all want to do their own thing and it takes way longer as a result. You seem like the ideal person to run in to, however, props for that!
---
It adds nothing to my enjoyment of the game. RDR2 pretty much nailed the mechanics for me. You get negative penalties for being fat or skinny and you have to clean your gun with some oil you can find. 
---
Man, I think you are missing what I am saying.
---
Why are some items that weight 100lbs easier to pick up than other items?
---
Why can I fit some items that weigh 100lbs in a backpack and not other items?
---
I am saying the weight is not the only metric that makes something hard to carry. Let that be reflected in the game. Start with bulked items being easier to store and carry. 
---
I still have some double-checking and formatting to do, but I wanted you to have access to it as soon as possible. There are two sheets - one with every plan that can be bought sorted from A-Z, and another one that shows each vendor's inventory sorted by their location.
---
Let me know if you see anything that looks incorrect or have feedback on how to make it better. Thanks!

I know they do it when selling homes but I don't know when else it would be practical.

Fyi, the keypad is on the wrong side of the wall, not your fault on that one

ah yeh i am very familiar with.him...since the patch he has the same plans every time i go.there..

Wow thank you!

Person with spreadsheet just posted in thread 
---
You caught me I’m a follower!! I also follow yourubers and twitch streams. Oh no I’m a stalker!!!
---
Thanks, I don't think I know where Hornwright Air Cleanser #3 site is? Is that also over there by Mount Blair, or elsewhere?
---
It shouldn't be too low of a chance to get mods from them, granted the Submachine Gun has very, very few mods last I checked. If you're crafting and scrapping I'd recommend using Super Duper and Scrapper for, obvious reasons.
---
Thanks again for this! By the way, are plans like this just random drops around the world, because I don't think the vendors actually sell these plans from what I'm seeing.
---
Totally agree. I have a one star combat rifle I've used a lot but I can't find anything worth replacing it after weeks. 
---
That'll teach 'em to steal my care package...
---
Ha that seems worse! Its like the people on dating apps who edit their photos so much you barely recognize them when you meet them.
---
Would you kindly ignore HDR
---
Yeah I have an outside ‘yard’ with my lead extractor, small purifiers and plants (I mean if you really wanted to get in im sure you could jet pack over the walls or some shit) and that’s the only locked portion. The rest of my camp is open.

I seriously do not understand why people keep complaining  about keeping a supply of the fucking things.
---
I did this and rebuilt my cache, on ps4. It didn’t do anything 
---
It sure does look awesome.
---
I like the idea where enemy armor deteriorates with each consecutive hit. Scaling with stats would become op.
---
The Mole Miners and Ghost People are both ghoul variants trapped is suits, so yeah, it makes sense there are similarities. As for the Wendigos, they're partially mystical. It's an old native american legend. Basically, cannibals turn into Wendigos. So the Wendigos are what's left of the Gourmand raider gang.
---
You can keep taking new perks and move special points after lvl  50
---
Laser/NRG weapon damage perk in Intelligence would be fantastic, in terms of scaling damage with the stat, I feel that because INT already increases the durability of crafted items they would have to balance things out a bit.
---
Balancing could vary from Perception increasing Crit Chance, High INT doesn't give as much bonus durability to crafted items, things somewhat along those lines.
---
(Please add NRG damage cards, 11 INT and a dream damnit...)
---
It would be easy, logical, and awesome. 
---
Never gonna happen. 
---
I've been having issues all day even signing in
---
So THAT's what happened when I activated the Vault 87 G.E.C.K.!
---
Really?! If say I find plans and ammo in the blue suitcase at Watoga station at least 30% of the time...more if there is a recent nuke zone. I've found 2 separate ultracite PA plans in there. Closing in on a full set! :)
---
I posted this same exact post right before I reached 100. I’ve done every quest and gotten every gun and power armor there is to get (at least that I want). There was nothing left for me to do but get the platinum. So now I got that and I’m just waiting for new content, haven’t played in about a week, other than messing with my camp a little 
---
pretty much. Un-armed melee or sneak vat crit build.
---
Idk the first one wasn’t working 
---
More or less yes, the things you listed above are pretty common for PvP or general Grief confrontations.
---
Outside of those, Stealth builds, Bloodied builds, and Melee/Mutant players are something to heavily consider countering.
---
This game has been out for 3 months now. You don’t exactly have to rush to get to level 150 after 3 months 
---
You get radded up to less than half your life so your bloodied weapons do more damage and you can't accidentally heal back up. 
---
Ugh! Really?! Dumb, sorry!
---
No shit. With my multiple legendary shotgun weapons I love the Miners 
---
Get it while the gettins good! Once they initiate the player vendor feature, I don't think this will be much of a thing anymore.
---
No, you want Hornwright Testing Site #3.  Do you have those 3 very large buildings in the very south of Ash Heap marked on your map yet?  If not, you can see them from clear across the map so just head towards them.  When you get near them, or let's say the one called "Unfinished Mansion" in particular you should see the symbol for Vault 64 (I think that's the number) on your radar a little southwest of Unfinished Mansion.  Once you get the vault marked on the map you'll notice that there's a road that curves around the vault to the north and then kinda wiggles to the west.  At the end of that road the spot you want.  It's marked on the map, but you won't be able to see the name until you discover it.  Once you get it marked on the map I would recommend fast traveling to the location even if you're right on top of it because where it puts you is exactly where you want to be to get iron.  I had said earlier that maybe someone else got the iron before you if it was missing, but I since read that veins are instanced so they'll always be there for you.  If they're like other stuff they should refresh every 18-20 hours.  After you FT there immediately look to your left.  On the hill you'll see a vein although that one can be hard to get if you don't have the angle just right.  Go up the path in front of you then back along the ridge (not inside the fenced area) and you'll see several veins along the top.  There's some more down lower from where you FT'd in.
---
It's easiest if you just explore a little right there in the area you land.  I was able to get over 100 iron ores and I think 17 lead ore from that spot.  There are other threads that talk about this spot and describe another spot with veins near by, but I never could follow the guy's directions.
---
So you agree that it's a buff and an advantage (doesn't matter how big) Thanks for finally seeing the point. I trust you can find the door yourself.
---
This. Sit there idle waiting for cores and get ganked by a bored level 200. Setup a nice base for resources and server will crash within 8 mins. Good info, thanks for sharing.
---
Agreed. I get either the same prefix multiple times or the same armor/weapon type. I have even got the exact same thing in the same mob. Either their tables get stuck or it’s not RNG. 
---
You're right, that photo crashed my computer.
---
Don't fool yourself. You're a consumer whore. Like most gamers. You'll still buy SF and the next ES. 
---
Watch how fast all this "I'm never buying another BGS game ever again" self satisfying, naive bullshit fails. 
---
I like 76. It could be better. It didn't meet my expectations. It's gotten far less playtime from me than other BGS games.... 
---
Will I buy the next ES? Umm yeah. I'll have that pre ordered day one. 
---
So will you. 
---
So will every other person who says "I'm a huge fan of Fallout or Elder Scrolls, but I'll never buy another BGS"
---
You can cut the act. The internet doesn't care.
---
I still think we should be able to combine them
---
Density
---
If you use bolstering gear your damage resists go up as your health goes down.
---
10mm or .45? They both only have a handful of mods. 
---
Strange, i keep stealing them and I don’t get bounties 
---
You don’t want t45 anyway. Get excavator 
---
Plus 100 carry weight for full suit
---
Plus 200 carry weight for full suit and calibrated shocks 
---
Plus 300 carry weight for all the above and if you server hop inside suit
---
Updated the lead photo, added an altar to the top
---
I’ve run through a harpers ferry blast zone and it kinda sucked honestly.  It just wasn’t that active. Plenty of violet flux though. 
---
This map is YUGE imo 
---
It's really annoying. Makes mutations in general behave weirdly. 
---
Go straight through glass caverns to Taggerdy's corpse ignore everything if you've the strength and stims then go to Fort Defiance and read the terminal. Kill the bat if you want to play the 'what shit loot will I get today' lottery.
---
Don't bother with those damn Transponders spread out around Watoga.
---
"I was not having server connection issues" you were decynced( a client side server connection issue) the server didn't think you were there that's apparent by the lack of mob aggro to you litterally walking right up and being able to attack them.
---
So when you tried to attack them the server said that's impossible and corrected the hp back a quick relog should fix and unless you intentionally caused this I doubt it will happen again as I'm at 550ish hours never seen a client position decynced.
---
 This isn't the same bug from before though similar
---
Schucks...I didn't mention it because of how specialized it is but I suppose I could make that work albeit I'd probably die and respawn a few times.
---
I've given up entirely, I carry around Halloween candy to eat before I try to fast travel, and I only drink dirty water. I have the starving debuff 99% of the time I'm playing and honestly I never miss the ap. 
---
Well thanks for the PSA. I too am in the habit of prepping my character for the next session. I check my garden and extractor one last time  cook my food, clean my inventory, make a list of things I need to sell, eat/drink, play an instrument to relax, then go to bed. It is a pleasant easy ritual to end my play session. 
---
Never seen you on here before but this was an amazing read +pie 
---
Not unless your team mate was there with you and didn’t get booted as well. Then you can join on him. Next time if you can don’t launch a nuke unless you’re on a team. You’re far from the first to put in all that hard work just to be kicked after launching the nuke
---
Why carry heavy melons? Carry halloween candy and pick up dirty water as needed. Only eat candy when you need to fast travel and just get used to having less ap, you won't miss it. 
---
.45mm. Maybe I already know everything there is to know. I don't knowthe Hardened reciever though, so maybe that can only be found as a drop? 
---
This only happens when your planning on grinding events. They want to prevent people from server hopping, but do things such as limiting events to promote it!
---
Good for you, dont let anyone stop you from becoming a successful short story writer. Though id like to read more about you and your experiences and not the rambo archetype.
---
I'm not forgetting resistance at all. In pvp they're a bit strong but mostly not very threatening compared to actually good weapons with real range. For high level enemies (where you'd logically expect to use nukes and crazy ass explosives) they're basically not great. A mini nuke is good for mowing down a large group of weak mobs, but so is literally anything so whats your point? Mine still stands, outside of that niche scenario the inventory cost of nukes and other explosive weapons is too high for their yield and usefulness.
---
You lost me at 600 hours in and level 34.  
---
There is some serious projecting going on here. Yikes. 
---
*D-Did we buy the Skyrim??!* 
---
/s
---
Hey look, it happened again when I logged in today 🙄 only lost around 160 lead when the server immediately disconnected me as well! 
---
Whatever you feel comfortable with. Everything is viable if you spec into and utilize the tools given. About 200 DR should be a good goal. And at least 50 damage on your weapon otherwise you're just going to tickle people.
---
Sure buddy. Go back to spamming "it just works" over and over again.
---
nah I'm thinking about picking it up on switch and doing a mobile playthru and watching GeneralSam123's playlists, saw the skeever and looked it up. literally the same texture without fur 
---
He's a troll.
---
Your point is well made but I'm just here giggling at the idea of someone trying to carry 45 pound of toilet paper rolls. 
---
^ this + Nerd Rage for that extra boost (NR activates earlier).
---
I cant leave out 15 points in strength since weight is an issue in this game. And lots of my cards are in weight management instead of the more fun perks. Would be nice if everybody got 3 free Charisma points. Because I would like some group perks, but not at the sacrifice of my solo experience. 
---
That is my grandson. We share the account here and he doesn't love this game as much as I have found. Not too sure what that phrase means though, I've heard it before.
---
&gt; It does suck, but you can make a new char. I did the same with my first, it sucked. He is now deleted and replaced.
---
I don't have much time to play this game. So starting a new character because my build wasn't good (exact same reason as Mutagrawl) isn't such a great option for me.  
---
Let's hope nothing else that i use get nerfed without getting the option to total rebuild / respec.
---
Lol
---
And in case you missed it, it happened to me yesterday but looked even worse:
---
https://youtu.be/wMKDo0NYsek
---
I was trying to come up with something ridiculous to drive home the point. I’ll leave you to guess where I was when I wrote the post.
---
Cool story bro....
---
I didn't know there was more than just the dirty one... I've been running around in a full dirty nurse outfit?! I need to fix this.
---
I have a couple of the hats though.
---
Look for tree clusters.  They always have several ferns under them.  The last time I did prime I walked away with 60 raw violet and I could have kept going.  
---
There’s a perk that makes stimpacks work much faster. Worth it for that
---
Did you seriously post this in every fucking thread? 
---
A duping loophole was allegedly re-opened..  
---
And duping requires an unstable server... So
---
They gotta PAY ME to play it at this point , 
---
Am i right guyz???
---
Running as fast as they can from that house near Bolton Greens, I bet.
---
We should be able to use Sugar Bombs from the factory.
---
Play a real man game like dota 2 or doom idk .to have fun when you wait for a fo76 fix
---
Had a high lvl visitor stumble across my CAMP (it’s a little off the beaten path), and after an initial moment of panic thinking they were going to destroy my whole base, they signaled they were friendly and I let them inside. They looked around for a second and then proceeded to drop a ton of recipes, plans and other items, and then left. 
---
That was my first meaningful experience with another player, and I definitely will be paying it forward.
---
Yes this!!! Or even if they made it slightly more realistic using ammo as in dropping spent mags. I always thought even in FPS games there should be a quick reload and a normal. If you quick load you drop the old magazine and the left over ammo.  So use half magazine and reload quickly you loose the other half. Guns with internal magazines (shotgun) should be immune but would have only one load speed.
---
&gt; the reason the downvote button exists
---
Again, 76 itself.
---
And they taste yummy 
---
I personally support the woooosh
---
Definitely not a pie.
---
Cobblers are in the family of scoopable fruit deserts that include Cobbler, crisps, crumbles, bubble and squeak and some others. 
---
They are largely fruit mixtures cooked without a bottom crust (though some southern variations feature a layer of crumble on the bottom as well) and topped with a struggle, biscuits, oatmeal mixture, batter or sometimes streusel. 
---
Like most classic American desserts, they likely originate with the Pennsylvania Dutch, who also were responsible for shoo fly pie (personal fav, dry bottom preferred), apple butter, American style fruit pies, and chicken pot pie. 
---
If it's an American baked dessert featuring fruit or molasses it's likely from the Pennsylvania Dutch. 
---
Also, cobbler again, not a pie.
---
[It's an arms race!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNm5drtAQXs)
---
Used to be at Grafton station from server hops but I haven’t seen them ever since the update. 
---
You see these enemies more often because they make up 90% of Appalachia's former population; robots and (former) humans.
---
I don't even have that mutation and this keeps happening to me. I must be cursed!
---
I can tell you for certain it doesn't activate 40% of the time on my Gauss Rifle. I'd save a lot on materials if it did.
---
The nuka grape she sells is amazing! It removes radiation without the negatives of radaway, heals, and sates thirst, all in one!
---
I fully agree. It's very annoying when you have to rejoin several times to get away from a broken or laggy server.
---
Great post! So I made a plasma gun today and realized how few mods I have for these guns...going to have to start saving up materials to unlock more. But with my trial weapon, I was really impressed with how quick mobs went down although I had to get really close to the mobs to hit them...Oh and I did try the prime receiver as it was one of the only ones I had unlocked... :)
---
Thanks for your service!
---
Can confirm, great customer service.
---
Good question. I’m yet to find enough people wanting to do this. One of the last things I have yet to try. 
---
No, you only lose any junk items you are holding
---
The cap seems kinda okay just where it is, I think.  You're not supposed to be able to get so many stats near max naturally, you're supposed to specialize a bit or make use of food and chems to boost yourself.  Jack-of-all-trades gets closer to master-of-all-trades if you get too many SPECIAL points to assign.
---
Sweet thank you
---
That's exactly what Warframe does. PC gets shit quicker, but we also tend to be the guinea pigs for bugs and stuff. As things get fixed and added on, DE then has a bulk update for consoles.
---
They’re on of the most interesting enemies in fallout for me, since they remind me of ghost people with their suit problems. The main differences being ghost people were confirmed adults, being workers who accidentally were sealed in faulty hazmat suits, which slowly seeped them in the cloud until they became almost undead ghouls. Mole Men on the other hand (children or not) almost seem like they’ve grown exponentially, being larger than a human and definitely misshapen. Huge hands, a slouched back, a green color and eyes clotted with what seem to be cataracts. It’s like they came into contact with FEV, evolving to love underground and carry out their mining tasks, befriending the mole rats as their only silent company. Or, more creepily, they actually mated with mole rats... eugh... 
---
Or maybe its because the entire explosives weapon line got nerfed for no real reason.
---
Yeah I can totally see that as well. I tried playing Fortnite as a replacement yesterday and griefers there started following me and attempting to box me in. There's no perfect fix for it, but there is a better. Even if they made it that you couldn't place a camp with someone else there, people could just stand there on purpose. But it could always detect you in someone else's camp and offer a very short free fast travel to get you out. There's always ideas to fix things. 
---
I've *almost* done this several times. Now I'm paranoid about going through decontamination arches and I use the perk manager addon to swap between perk loadouts.
---
I kinda liked it
---
Lol, the way this comment ended with ... shows a very tired Bethesda trainee replying us here on /r/fo76 
---
You lost me at pork skins. Stop eating tortured murdered baby animals.
---
I'm just sick to death of this bullshit self congratulating mentality that features in the imaginary game consumer revolution of "voting with our wallets" and "I won't stand for this! I'll never buy a game from X Dev again!"
---
It's utter stupidity. Gamers are eager consumers to a fault. 
---
Bethesda could post a picture of a glass jar labelled "Elder Scrolls 6 pre-orders, $5" written in crayon and every person who said "I'll never buy another BGS game again" would line up to throw money at the picture because they couldn't find the actual jar quick enough. 
---
Well given Trolls in most games have a high magic stat, you mean to tell me he's magical? 
---
The weapon and armor mod plans are a mixed bunch. Before patch 5 many of them were part of a vendors random list and also appeared in the world and also part of event drops. After patch 5 many plans that used to spawn at vendors no longer do and nobody is sure why. I don't think anyone knows if this was intentional on Bethesda's part or another unintentional change that resulted from patch 5.
---
Actually if you think about it..  
---
You have to be a pretty spectacular min-max player to ONLY be level 34 in 600 hours, I mean I have a level 10 mule who's gained  9 level standing in camp being attacked by level 10 mole rats..  
---
That or the whole story is fiction ;)
---
Super useful information power armor players.
---
You're selling serums for 13 caps each?
---
I'm tired of having so much stuff.
---
Nuked Harpers Ferry before and it was ok. Really was just full of super mutants and they seemed to spawn faster but it wasn't anything special.
---
Would still prefer a Fissure Site prime or whitesping nuke for more enemies. Nuke sites should just flood the area with enemies everywhere.
---
After putting around 30 hours into this game, I can safely tell that I wouldn't even want to get this pile of shit as a gift. This is the first game I've ever played where I was close to demanding a refund. The concept isn't even that bad but they fucked up on every single thing they could and lied to their consumers on so many occasions it's crazy. I don't wanna be THAT guy but this is the worst game I have played in the last 10 years and it's making me sad to see Bethesda go down this road.
---
Don't forget exploding randomly so you will die sometimes for seemingly no reason
---
No problem
---
But i do ask that you use them for yourself please
---
Why do you even bother selling duped stuff that cheap?
---
I added you 
---
Why? You can get at least 200 caps per serum. 
---
It isn't duped stuff that I know of. People give me shit, drop it, etc
---
You can get them all (well 18 of 19) and then get rid of one. If you lose something other than Empath, get it back and try again. That's what I did, and it took about 5 hours total to gain all 18 and then keep losing one and regaining it until I lost Empath. I'm currently at 11 of 19 known serum plans. Once I get all the serum plans for the mutations I want, I'll clear all of them out and add back just the ones I want.
---
Yeah honestly almost everything ever made has screws so why are they so rare 
---
Ahhhh, so it might be unintended and a wait and see kinda thing. Or I can just hope to stumble upon one in the world somewhere (yikes).
---
Do you have a Bloodied TwoShot Explosive handmade??
---
Because I'm tired of having so much shit lol
---
Many events only trigger on proximity, the longer the game goes the more people have more fast travel points open and the less they're exploring so the fewer events they're triggering. 
---
Bethesda, are you going to do anything about the durability of laser weapons? 
---
I get maybe 2 reloads before it breaks. In all other (fallout) games a laser build is a common thing. Yet, in fo76, they are useless, and because of this any laser weapons or science perks are a complete waste of time.
---
Please make laser weapons as durable as their ballistic counter parts. 
---
Please. 
---
Found the red hat in an upper level kitchen / break room area if it helps. 
---
I mean really... instead of going to destroy every tiny bit of value ingame, just keep it for yourself or drop it where no one gets it. You can't tell me it's legit farmed. It's duped stuff.
---
Some of the pipe weapons use them for the trigger. Yet you do not even gain any from scrapping those weapons. 
---
Had same situation with 10mm smg. Like I understand lesser mods you have unknown - lesser chance you will get them from scrapping. Seems each mod has it's own fixed chance of getting it from scrapping rather than guaranteed chance to get some mod from the pool of unknown.
---
So say weapon has 10 possible mods and we don't know any of them. Each mod has 10% of getting it from scrapping, so with first weapon we scrap there is 10x10%=100% chance we get a mod from scrapping. Next scrap we have 90%, then 80, etc. And last mod 10%, which is already hard to get from few scrapping.
---
That is how I see it, it maybe different, but for sure that last unknown mods are hardest to get.
---
Also there is a list of mods you can learn by scrapping somewhere here on reddit, so make sure you check that if nod you want can actually be learned through scrapping. Sorry, I can't provide the link - I'm texting from phone.
---
Potentially different characters? 
---
NPCs.... someone is still alive somewhere.  Bring in a BHOS airship..... some enclave fuckers looking to take over the silos... something.  The game is boring as fuck.
---
I don't have more than one of a few serums
---
And a few bobbleheads etc
---
do this it will fix it
---
The game needs a Grahm loyalty mission
---
I don't, sorry!
---
They make good eatin
---
Not as boring as your suggestions. 
---
And gears
---
I tried selling for more. No one wants to trade
---
Very hard quests to obtain QoL enhancements like stash size increases, plans, or legendary power armor parts. Raids/dungeons that are so hard it takes a coordinated group of skilled players to complete. Extended overseer storyline. New interior cells to explore or more map loactions appear. New world map areas. This is just a sample: there are many, many more possibilities.
---
I got my first 2 star after the last patch, since then I get continual 2-3 stars drops, usually 3-4 in one loop of white springs 
---
NavyBluePaint is my username, I will add you soon mate.
---
serums weight 0.25 and are worth way more - however, do whatever you want...
---
People voted with their wallets. Why you think they Giving out the game for free? Why you think metro Dev just apologized when they threatened fans? Ppl ain't gonna take the bullshit, or recycled garbage anymore. You can shovel it into your gaming device, but I won't, and neither the ppl who didn't buy. 
---
Lost my prime 3* Super sledge yesterday. Raised a ticket with Bethesda in the list items category ( yes a whole topic for this) and was told that they don't have the capability to return lost items... What gives?
---
Especially sucks as  as I am doing a melee build.
---
Drifter outfit, Doctor smiling mask, pirate hat, Instigating camo hunting rifle.
---
 Travelling pharmacy  (carring around 100 super stimpacks cause this trash adds so quickly when you are farming SBQs for while). In endurance main perk is cannibal becouse i love to [eat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN0hbQALkag&amp;t=126s) my enemies. Perciption = rifle damage and tank killer of course. Then i have milion of agility becouse i am ninja ok? And luck, you need luck, everyone needs it.
---
For sneak build you need mutations: Bird bones, speed demon, marsupial, eagle eyes, adrenal reaction.
---
When i s night and f\*ing bugged sneak (thanks bethesda for broking escape artistan) works, i can oneshot like most of things. When i am spotted, i still can oneshot atleast ghouls and scorched (if they have full hp).
---
Man this comment is one big flexfest when it comes to text lol.
---
Now tell me, are you tearing enemies apart, or just tickle them?
---
Oh wow! Did not know that. Thanks!
---
Yeh... most people want to play the gamecock, not spend all their time in menus and load screens server hopping.
---
No they do not.  They are useless and annoying!  
---
Homemade and radiumfor me
---
You can go suck a dick.  It isnt an all inclusive list of things they can do other than what they have.  Just making a point.  They can do so much more. Fucking moron.  
---
I kill them lol. I do something around 80 dmg per shot + 95% armor pen
---
Tamable humanoids? Buddy that's slavery
---
Release an outfit that says “I survived B.E.T.A.” On the back in the atom shop and let us sell them for 200 caps lol
---
Trolls belong in Skyrim!
---
No wait Skyrim belongs to the Nerds 😂
---
I found a complete suit of Ultracite Power Armor in a trunk at a vendor.  I'm level 27.
---
Single player vs multiplayer 
---
There are already tameable creatures for your camp, just no companions
---
Imagine if there were a spot in the middle of the map like a construction site where everyone can contribute to rebuilding it as a player trade hub. The trading can be added so it doesn't need to be delayed from the activity, but players have to bring steel and wood and screws etc. and it's across all servers, so not just one server but all servers all people working together ti rebuild this place. And there's like a progress bar, and as mile stones are reached then more parts are filled in and completed. And by the end of it we can have our own player stores, which were just broken worn barely functioning Miss Nanny and Mr Handy bots before, but now it's all nice and fixed up and good looking with a bunch of benefits for each milestone and for your personal contributions you get little upgrades for your vendor bot also, paint schemes (Like Rose Raider style etc.). I haven't thought it through just some random thoughts but something like that maybe. So people are all working on a common cause.
---
Wendigos can hunt in packs of three though. There's a spot in the mire with a truck almost lifted up by a strangler vine that is a common spot for 3 glowing wendigos to ambush a player
---
 They hide up in the trees and wait for you to get in between all of them to strike. 
---
I like to take the highway from watoga up to the red rocket mega stop as a daily ritual for xp and random event encounters, occasionally running of the highway to visit players. This one encounter I always run into at the very last stretch of my journey. 
---
I know that still doesnt help much in the long run, but it's something. 
---
Personally i believe wendigos just might still be alive in all other games, just that they have been confined to Appalachia. If they are a form of ghoul they probably don't mate and can only be created. This would mean that an environmental factor could keep them from spreading. 
---
Or at least show us what pieces are equipped when you hover your mouse over the frame. 
---
My method gets me a bunch of fusion cores, many full or near full, in a fraction of the time of the OP's method.  After which I... you know... go and spend the rest of my time playing the game.
---
It is the marsupial mutation
---
what happens if I mismatch all my armor though?
---
Hahahahahaha. 
---
Giving it away in Australia. You think Australia with it's population barely what? Half of California's is any games most important market? 
---
And you think apologies by a company mean something? Hahahahahahaha oh God that's rich. 
---
Go ask Exxon or BP how much their constant apologies have changed the energy industry. Hahahahah.
---
Really. Thank you for that. 
---
Here is the problem with that. They would have to have the base frame numbered or coded to be slotted. Not everyone wears a full set of T45 or T60. Some people like to mix and match and that has been their biggest issue during to people trying to make a quick equip mod and losing pieces of PA armor on the process. This happened during BETA and was swept under the rug. But good point.
---
FO 76 seems to be the worst game to be a collector in though....
---
Welcome to the Legion.
---
Gaaaaary
---
The devs are from like 11 different studios. Of course they aren't playing it.
---
Super easy! Awesome camp. Recommend to everyone. Thanks!
---
"Mistress of Mystery" would like a word with you, but Mole Miners are pretty great, too.
---
It will save us a shitload of ammo, though.
---
There are ways to do this without adding human NPCs. I don't see why that's a MUST. If they let us build anywhere. Hold bases and allow seiges. Work on robot ai... (Probably impossible lol. Then put robots or super mutants in towns allowing them to be interact with players. Give us player vending and allow markets.
---
There's dozens of things they could do they just don't seem like it's what they want seeing how limited we are in a lot of community aspects.
---
If they wanted to they could add human NPCs but only allow them to live in our settlements. Let our camps attract settlers. 
---
Endgame should be something with easy first step, and **fucking nightmare** on end. When you want to keep playing, you need to have some challenge, but also see you are doing some progress over time.
---
Bethesda said vaults will be long dungeons with little parts that you must finish in 15minutes. I love how silo works, it is still challenge, even thru  [it is easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw58NzHaI0g) 
---
We could discuss about this for years. I hope bethesda will make something that will beat World of warcraft raiding, or be atleast nearly as good.
---
You seem... very... passionate about your cobblers.
---
I like it and those extra 26 perks will just be weight perks anyways 
---
This isnt "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", it's barely Fallout and more like "Kurt Kobain's reason he blew his brains out over this frustration"
---
Make him orange. 
---
Psycho did you say? What about changing your party and joining us, who can use what ever drugs all day long, kill people and other great things?
---
Thats nice damage for this fast fire rate. 
---
&gt;Bethesda
---
&gt;Honestly giving a shit
---
Choose one, you can't have both. This is a developer that never fixes their games and leaves some literally unplayable. They aren't magically changing course on an MMO.
---
Expect the remaining playerbase to be milked via the Atom Store while they sporraticly test new, unfinished ideas for other titles.
---
How long do you expect people to wait given the borderline unplayable state of gunplay atm?
---
Thank you for succinctly describing what OP was trying to say! 
---
This is some of the worst White Knighting of FO7  I've seen. It makes no sense. You're incoherent. 
---
&gt;please shut up with these shit posts.
---
The irony. Nice negative votes.
---
Bloodied explosive, because it's perfect for griefing noobs, and that's the best way to hurt BGS.
---
Anything to stop that incessant beeping
---
True, but It's a void because the game is practically dead and empty.
---
I dont think this community knows what the term "Griefing" actually means. 
---
Or maybe it's the new hipster way of crying about Fallout. That's all I have read for 3 months. This happened.. and that happened.. griefers or grieving.. 
---
Just come play a real game where you lose your weapons, armor, materials, aid, ect and then they hunt you down over and over and over while sending you screenshots of your dead corpse and weapons in their inventory. That would be griefing, or at least Chaotic Player Killing (CPK). 
---
You cupcakes aren't ready.
---
In your post you say it gives slots for extra perks, which it does not.
---
I actually found something interesting tonight. I found a lamp mod for a T 60 helmet, makes my light purple, but it also added a symbol next to the name of my power armor after I modded it.
---
Now I can easily tell which is my excavator set and which is my T 60 set.
---
Fuck me, seriously? And people wonder why we're calling this an asset flip.
---
As a man running around in a green and black dress, it saddens me that there's no mens variant of said dress.
---
Be thankful. Another weak of no further breaking the game. 
---
Though now demo expert is only 60% instead of 100% :(
---
so true.
---
They screwed us.
---
I don't imagine the items being for sale as not counting against your stash weight though, because if so that's quite easy to abuse as well.  Don't want to limit yourself on the  springs in your stash, but don't want them to actually sell from your vendor either because you want them for later?  Price them at 20c/ea.  They'll never sell, and aren't taking up space if it doesn't count against your stash.  I used springs as an example, but really insert any item and it applies the same.
---
Really hope this is an actual vet posting some satire as if not...its not fucking funny I've lost friends and family in the core and even claiming service is stolen valor and not a laughable matter. Like I said hoping for satire otherwise you are one of the lowest forms of scum in the world. 
---
My bf says that the monster mash is a reliable source of 3 star legendary, that is of course assuming that it hasn't been nerfed...
---
They remind me of minions if they got mutated by radiation.
---
but it is so much easier to just nerf everything.  It does also cost less. That is why they do it
---
Only had one encounter so far. A friend and I finally wandered into the ash heap. We donned our masks and were traversing the burning terrain to reach the giant excavator machine we saw from a distance.
---
All of a sudden the ground was exploding and we thought there must be mines implanted or something? But it was just a mole miner blowing us up! We killed him but he fell face first so I couldn't get a good look at him.
---
Server disconnects or crashes?
---
If crashes then do you use power armor?  
---
If you use power armor do you have a Targeting HUD?  
---
If yes read this.  
---
[[Bug Fix] Pretty sure I just figured out the cause of the PowerArmor Targeting HUD CTD's AND THE FIX.

People are just complaining because they blew through all the content too fast. The Fallout fanbase isn't really used to a game like this, and they're playing it like a typical single player game that you can grind up, snort and discard in a month. You can do that with this game, but in reality it was designed for the long haul. After you've completed all the main and side quests the primary goal is to tweak your build. Yes it's grindy, yes the game is in its infancy and there's going to be nerfing, and yes there's going to bugs to get ironed out... But right now those that are in the "endgame" portion of the game are actually helping Beth by providing metrics and data that will help them with the future content. Granted this portion of the game is a different experience than they originally envisioned because the dupers killed the need for nukezone farming and grinding for better legendary gear... And yes Beth deserves a portion of the blame for not identifying and eliminating the dupe glitches sooner.. But that doesn't absolve the dupers and exploiters of all responsibility either . 
---
I digress though... There's lots of new content coming. All those people saying they're giving up because of the lack of content just simply got there build where they want it, and are itching to play more of this game. 
---
Better. Say on a percentage scale. 
---
20-35% increase of good stuffs. 
---
Only time I've been griefed in any sense happened this morning.  Took over a workshop for the daily, and in the middle of defend the workshop someone one-shot me.  I guess in their defence they only took the rare junk in my death bag, and left me the metal scrap.
---
You don't have to pick a perk from the special that you choose when you level up. For example, you can pick strenght and gunsmith.
---
And after level fifty you get no special points, but still get perk points.
---
You can choose to increase a stat point but pick the card from a different stat.  
---
After picking the special navigate right and left to pick a card from a different special stat
---
Hard.
---
I had the ante thing happen to me except he destroyed my entire camp. Reason: you locked your door. I proceeded to spend half an hours getting enough parts to fix all my generators purifiers wall and roofs
---
After level 50 you can pick more cards voluntarily also. Plus you get card packs which can sometimes have the perk card you want 
---
There's two things you can do:
---
1. Wait for them to allow you to sell ammo to the vendor bots (for pitiful caps) or scrap it (for very little resources).  Booo, hisss!  Nobody wants this solution :)
---
2. **Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar Trading Reddits and sell it there for LOTS OF CAPS :)**
---
Depending on the type of ammo, it can go for up to 1 cap per round!  
---
FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar selling tips:
---
1. Start with whatever you "think" it will sell for and list it.
---
2. If it doesn't sell in 1 hour, post again and lower the price some.
---
3. Repeat 2 until it's all sold :)
---
Note:  If you're selling ammo for less than 1 cap a round, put up the number of rounds it takes to buy ALL of that type for 1 cap.  So if I have 1,000 x .45 Rounds and I want 500 caps..............I put 500 of the rounds up for 1 cap each.  Then after they buy you put the other 500 up for 0 caps each.
---
Hope that helps!  Happy selling!
---
Big **no**, BoS is better if END is a **must have**. Otherwise just skip end because it's mostly useless. More STR = more damage, more damage = faster, kill = less damage taken... That means the enclave underarmor is best for melee and there's really no room for conversation on that point.
---
Yeah, she is peaved. She only wanted the Prime Fissure site nuked.
---
Tbh I’d just like melee to correctly register hits
---
For some reason on pc if you add more ppl in the silo you get more glitches, mainly the mainframe cores and not being able to remove/install them. Generally takes me or my wife 15 minutes to run a silo if we go together we always get stack at the mainframe for 6 minutes before it lets  either of us pick them up.
---
So that's a no help, thanks.
---
I’ll be lookin, and we will see
---
It's a terrible interface, but perk selection is far more flexible than that. When selecting a perk, there are controls to scroll through all available perks for that level, including perks from other SPECIALs. You can get Gunsmith 4 by level 15, and you can raise Int and take a Str perk or vice versa.
---
West Tek... plus tons of Assault Rifles, Gunpowder, and Caps from the Super Mutants that spawn there.
---
If we're really getting into it the Stash being based off of weight doesn't make sense anyway.  It's a box. 
---
Realistically you wouldn't be worried about the weight you put in said box.  Look at that Stash box.  It's a tough,  heavy weight box anyway. 
---
And we're just taking this junk and "throwing" it in there. 
---
Here's eight boxes of abraxo cleaner,  here's 27 pencils, 9000 10mm rounds.....blah, blah
---
If someone has ever packed something for vacation they know you don't just throw all your crap into your duffel bag/ suitcase if you're trying to conserve space. 
---
You meticulously fold your clothes,  put books in a stack,  place toiletries in the same back...etc
---
This is the idea bulking should follow.  I'm not going to throw 27 loose pencils into a a stash box.  I'm going to bundle the mofos together with a rubber band. The weight itself doesn't change but I can fit a whole hell of a lot more stuff in a box if everything is neatly stacked. 
---
So you're right. It doesn't reduce the weight of things by wrapping them up in a tight little bow.... but it SHOULD take up a lot less space. 
---
Nah they did everything right with the nerf. If u compare the mods now to the other Legendary effects u will find out that they are all balanced now. The Problem is either that the Weapons (rifle in your case) is underpowered, what also think that they are but not the dmg I mean the durability and Ammo, or your build sucks. Honestly u still have the Option to do a lot of dmg with Rifles but now u have to sacrifice something (loke health) to get to this point. And btw what was your "explo build" thaz the nerf destroyed because there is no such thing as a "explo build" u probably had 5 ranks of demo expert which u now need to respec. 5 wrong placed points
---
These multiplayer mini games sound great for the social aspect, it could very much be a reason for endgamers to hang out in the game whilst waiting for new content, and for any level player to interact with others. It doesn't need to be Gwent, just Hearts, or Shithead, or something would be cool. Even if it cost 200 atoms per game or something. Though to be honest, I think the extra stuff like that is waaaay down the list for BSG at the moment. And OP, yeah, I immediately thought of like some old movie where there is a race, to a treasure, with clues, it would be fun.
---
I like that idea!!!!!
---
So many wasted points on weight perks :(
---
Although they'd have to cap out melee damage at 15 points of strength (and yes my main is a melee).
---
I've started using my PA just to avoid needing to farm ballistic fiber lol. Since white knight changes I said fuck it, not worth.
---
Agreed &lt;nods calmly and arches fingers&gt;
---
[This happens.](https://youtu.be/eN0hbQALkag?t=89)  if you win/lose you get som caps, meds and ammo, dont have it on video tho
---
You quoted him and then countered with conjecture and opinion. There is no relevant evidence or fact in your points. 
---
That should explain the down votes.
---
Oh my god they killed Kenny! 
---
Always thought of Bioshock when I played Fallout 4. And I still think of it when I play 76. I'm guessing it's the art style that reminds me of that franchise. That they both are crushing on the 50s America. 
---
Power armor even reminds me of big daddies 
---
Re: CAMP's not being able to be placed (because someone else has moved in after me). 
---
Please provide an option, in that pop-up, to opt out rather than continuing to load the game. 
---
If I am in the vicinity of my CAMP and my CAMP can't be placed, I have no intention of continuing onto the server.  As we cannot opt out, it takes a long time for the game to load before we can go out and try again.
---
Yes please.
---
I don't play Fallout to grind until my fingers bleed :)
---
I play Fallout to explore, adventure, quest, and smash enemies in the face with my sledge!
---
Knowing the typical cat it puked all over the carpet, shit and missed the litter box and got scared and pissed on your plants so yeah it probably did grief you pretty good last night.
---
Could be good for aiming training if bullet holes stay in it.
---
ESO does it as well
---
yea i have a deathclaw named george
---
[No.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw58NzHaI0g)
---
So you mean to tell me that all these dumb Charisma cards I never use (since I don't play team) could have been useful cards? Dang.
---
The real question is does anyone have the traveling leather coat? I'll trade you a Hunters Jacket? Or whatever it's called. 
---
I know *exactly* why they freak me out. 
---
Sneaking through a mine, then suddenly you hear "Hhhrghh hnnn **Hhhhrrnnnhhh** hrrgh" from behind the next turn. 
---
More ppl = more mobs spawn. Try to go there with 4+ ppl, it is mess lol. (and those robots give tragicaly low Xps)
---
Each nuke zone should spawn a different behemoth type enemy. 
---
You don't make them in-game. Sites like Nukes And Dragons help you plan. It's really worth it because it means you can spend time working on a build so that you don't have to stress about it later. Though this is less important now that you can move Special points around every level after 50.
---
Ehm [Yeah.](https://youtu.be/Xrt4vZYMaH8?t=104) Min/maxing is trash.
---
Belive me, bloodied with proper armor is now meta. But you must be Pro.
---
Idk what people are doing that requires so many fusion cores. I'm in my PA 100% of the time on my heavy weapons toon and naturally find more fusion cores than I can possibly use.
---
I am level 50 BTW! Just haven't read up on everything except for a few posts here and there. Grrr.
---
Awol Armaments event, Uranium Fever event, One Violent Night event.
---
West Tek spawns two or three legendaries. Visit vendor bot Phoenix, legendaries spawn to fight him. Huntersville, the hardware store spawns a legendary Super Mutant. Suger Grove spawns a legendary Assaultron. Just wonder Watoga for awhile, legendary robots spawn often, plus the ghouls on the city limits will sometimes be legendary. Also just wonder the road, you will run into legendaries randomly.
---
I'd love this as a workshop idea especially if they made nuka cola 4 u
---
Monster. 
---
Idk man, i am never catching raindrops on eyes in real life.
---
Really? I have truckloads of violet flux. They're super plentiful by the trees at prime and it gets nuked all the time.
---
Did you report this to Bethesda?
---
Aah nice!
---
The Wanamingos now have an entry point to invade from.
---
Yeah, Armor Piercing, Hardened and Prime receivers for the SMG aren't unlockable by scrapping. Not sure whether any vendors are likely to sell the first two.
---
Well.....  
---
I am a raider...
---
I wouldn't worry about making a new character.  I did that at level 15 because I knew I could get those levels pretty quick.  With the new character I made a goal for what I wanted to have at level 50 (there are websites for that), but after getting to level 50 I changed my mind about what I wanted my perks to be.....then I changed my mind again.  I'm level 103 and I think I'm finally on the path to what I want to wind up with.  I think it will take me about 15 more levels give or take to get there.  The biggest hassle is when you put 3 (or more) points in something and you rethink it and decided fewer points would be better to give yourself room for another skill so then you have to take the skill all over again and build it up the lower number.  That right there is the most level consuming hassle of all.  I've had to do that with 3 skills.  I guess the good side is if I change my mind later I have the option to increase the perk immediately.
---
Touché...
---
I'm not saying i want to godmode, i just dont want to be one shot by everything in the damn game
---
Morgantown isn't bad for cobalt... dunno if it's better or worse than whitespring. The thing about the cobalt at whitespring vs morgantown is whitesprings cobalt is fairly concentrated on the east side making it easy to farm while at morgantown its spread out all over.
---
I was counting and i could make 10k caps in 12hours farming her with my mates. And like 40 legendary items and 80plans (mainly explosive vents). I think thats worth. I usually use max 200x .308 bullet for her. It depends on build of ppl around you.
---
 Virtually nothing he said applies to the previous games.   Ammo was plentiful enough to where you did not have to craft it.  You could repair weapons simply by finding another one just like it in better condition and then hitting repair.  You never had to round up obscure materials fix weapons, you simply needed another weapon just like it.  And vendors could repair weapons for you.  Virtually nothing he is complaining about was in any of the previous games. 
---
My thoughts exactly
---
It's not cynicism or being toxic when talking about Bethesdas shortcomings with fallout 76. It is embarrassing how little they are fixing and have fixed since the game released. I mean damn they took an entire month off mid December to January and didn't release a single patch one month after the game released in a terrible state. It sounds like you want people to act straight up delusional as if Bethesda is handling this situation well and the game isn't quickly heading towards death. It doesn't matter how much we like the game if Bethesda has given up and has a team of two people working on it that's not going to cut it.
---
How do we know what has prerequisite plans, and what those are?
---
Are there any for BoS combat armor plans?
---
Yep. It's all arbitrary numbers, for gameplay, or as BSG said, technical limitations.
---
Also they are adding items, that are in game files from day 1.
---
They are not new, just finaly avaible.
---
Bethesda is mainly doing stupid request of people here. Like whole new pvp servers.
---
I think it gets better the higher level you are.
---
I've brought up two characters and never really hid my base.  Just put it wherever I wanted.  Stayed away from high base location areas like Whitesprings.
---
I've had exactly one guy come and try to orbital strike my base.  Thankfully I was nearby, logged immediately, and had almost no repair costs.
---
It might just be me though.  They see my base is just a functional cube with rocket turrets on wings on the corners.  Or they see my level and wonder what kind of super OP build I might have.  Not sure.
---
Two days ago my clan leader crafted me a set of power armor for my rank in the clan. While venturing with my brother my left arm came off suddenly. I checked my inventory nothing, we went back to camp and i checked my stash nothing. My brother even checked his just incase some funny stuff had happen. We went back to the area and had a look around nothing.
---
In the end the clan leader was nice enough to craft me another modded one. But i thought i better mention this incase something funny is going on. Just incase Bethesda needs to fix something to stop this bug.
---
Same, and they dont appear on my "(known)" list when I visit Grafton Station.
---
Sturdy/ Heavy Combat Armor plans are like that too... like sometimes when I visit Watoga or Harper's Ferry I will see "(Known) Sturdy Combat Armor X" or "(Known) Heavy Combat Armor Chest" but other times I wont see this listed.
---
I think that some plan slots are still randomly populated on each server.
---
No, i am addicted.
---
I agree.  The weight limit deal probably screwed over the dupers hard....lol  Kinda hard to get rid of weight if your inventory is full of duped heavy weapons and armor.....lol
---
I hope they increase it soon.  Fallout has always been and always should have some hoarding involved :)
---
Yet another person who has not extracted the obviously true wisdom from the movie Poltergeist (1982).
---
I'd really rather they take the time to test the next patch more thoroughly than try to stick to some schedule that just pushes shit out.
---
Bigger stash is definitely my #1 request. 
---
If they're having problems with database recall times / lag, they can always do this:
---
All Junk, Ammo, and Aid (without condition bars) is unlimited or however high they can get it (1,000, 10,000, etc). It doesn't take any more time for a database to recall 10 steel as it does 1,000 steel. It's a line item name and a numerical value.
---
Since there are so many variants and conditions of armor and weapons and food items (literally millions if you take all the variables in), make that a FIXED number of slots in your stash (as many as they can get in there without lag).  So you could store 100 armor or weapons or food items.  As many items as they could do with good stability.
---
If it's a database retrieval problem, that would fix it :)
---
The presumably terrible things Bethesda did in the past is it’s shortcomings. 
---
What **you** say Bethesda will **do in the future** is your cynicism. 
---
It’s like throwing someone in jail now for a crime they will commit in the future. 
---
It says more about you than about Bethesda that you don’t understand this. 
---
And... yeah. username check out. 
---
Honestly,  a lot of screws are proprietary and will only fit certain sockets. For example try taking apart your Samsung and use them on your LG. It ain't happening. Also screws tend to strip when you remove them. I think we should get them from scrapping weapons and armor, but at a very low drop rate.
---
I just got the shielded plans for the under armor today
---
It never went away.  I thought it was intended behavior tbh.  Something that drops legendary loot should be a little special.  If you can't drop them in two quick hits they will regen.  Seems to happen every time and it's never stopped happening.
---
One does not simply report to Bethesda.
---
You still there?
---
Honesty why doesn't it do it automatically?
---
Stop getting pitiful caps for items :) 
---
Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar Trading Reddits and sell it there for more!

Plus that keeps the caps in the hands of the community, not caps sucking vendor bots.
---
Ask a friend to share it with you. If I'm not mistaken they can use Unyielding etc. to boost their Charisma is they need to.
---
I don't use this, but on your behalf:
---
Bethesda NOBODY is asking you to nerf this.  Please take away the nerf bat from whoever currently holds it :)
---
Sneaky night pistol build in silver shroud outfit with pirate hat.
---
Lol 50 muffled pipe revolver maxed damage reciever (can't remember exactly what)with long scope.
---
I have covert ops, Mr sandman,sneak, escape artist,action boy and gun fu maxed with 15 agility.
---
Night person, night eyes, sniper, crack shot (pistols), concentrated fire maxed on perception with 14 (Also have pannapictographist cause I want to find all magazines)
---
Quick hands, luck of the draw and grim reapers sprint in luck ( sprint rarely goes off if ever unfortunately)
---
I have 2x chameleon armour pieces buffs to perception on 1 rad resist on other.
---
Cloaking piece - when hit in melee it generates a stealth field once every 30 seconds. This is my lowest piece at level 20 because I haven't found a replacement higher level.
---
Nocturnal piece - adds strength, extra damage resist at night and harder to detect whilst sneaking.
---
Second nocturnal piece - strength, extra damage resist at night and reduces 50% fall damage for that emergency get away. P.s. you still die if you fall from realy large heights.
---
Treated road leathers as under armour for +1 perception and agility..
---
I really put the hurt on things between 6pm and 6am, other times it's average &amp; I get hurt more so I try to do most things at night.
---
"But honey, this looks so *pre-war*... \*sigh\* oh well, that's a lot of work but a few piles of dirt, a handful of stain and well-placed scratches and cracks over there will make your hideout FA-BOU-LOUS"
---
\&gt;  If you notice your core is low while you're not in danger, hop out and swap it for a full one. 
---
Not really relevant to your post (which is great info btw), but fusion core handling is wonky. It should be "equippable" instead.
---
Rough.  Couldn't you just respawn to your camp and come back to get your loot?  I had to do this the other day when I server hopped at Whitespring Station.  Loaded in and instant death by rads; had to have just dropped the nuke.  No PA or Hazmat on and RadWorms, it was hopeless to keep trying.
---
You said that very well! ;)
---
Thank you sir!
---
Everyone (rightfully) complains about the physics of the game being unrelated to what we experience in the real world (getting thirsty/hungry so fast, mobs insta-healing, etc) and here we have someone who apparently wants everyone to have a Bag of Holding, a tesseract if you will, to defy the Law of Conservation of Mass.
---
AWOL Armaments = Easily soloable.  Still easy in a group.  Crappy rewards.
---
How about 1 out of the 4 times AWOL spawns, it goes SUPER!
---
SUPER AWOL Armaments = Double the damage (minus some of the dang armor pen), quadruple the health, 6 waves instead of 3.  GUARANTEED 3 star rewards.  You'd be getting your butt kicked for about 20 mins, be low on ammo, stimpacks, broken armor.........but it would feel like you accomplished something.
---
Then you could happily grind back the mats, stims, ammo in preparation for the next one knowing you got at least a chance at good 3 star items!
---
Damn.. i was hoping for a higher capacity. Well well. 
---
While I'm at it - and I've tried to figure this out for other threads - I do want to have all 3 hacker perks, right?
---
A serious, heartfelt apology where someone high up actually eats some crow would make me stop criticizing the game.
---
I did the same thing for a couple of months, until someone else on this sub explained how much faster getting water from a creek, lake, etc. Tried it for about ten seconds and bam! - 78 dirty waters. 
---
Hudda hudda huh!
---
level 106, been going to watoga since level 16 and never seen anything in any suitcases either. I dump stuff at the overseers camp when I see a newbie in the vault, and I've also dropped stuff in the corpses outside 76. 
---
I'm still subbed to a few games I don't play anymore. It doesn't hurt anything and yeah it's nice to see how it's doing from time to time. If it's a game that I only played shortly I will unsub pretty quick though. I don't play 76 much anymore but I did put in a decent chunk of time while I did so it doesn't bother me to see how things are going, good or bad. 
---
Is this why Bethesda has constantly implemented things no one asked for instead of fixing things that urgently need to be fixed? Is all my friends leaving the game a half-assed way of "fixing" this bug?
---
If so kudos Bethesda, you sly bastards you. 
---
Oh no, I literally mean making our own games. You can make a giant chessboard, tic tac toe in your camp. I'm trying to see if I can build logic puzzles using switches and box- lights.
---
Just wondering if any1 has any other ideas of games/activities that could be made. I think I've got the logic game figured out, but I want some more interesting stuff like that.
---
Holy shit, that kinda dampens my mood on one of the 'different' enemies in the game :€
---
I did the same thing!  Got her to level 24 then I realized my mistake.
---
I think it's a problem from the standpoint of also bring ammo. It leaves your inventory, probably so you can't shoot yourself out of power armor.
---
Can confirm packs of 3, I had a pack attack me in cranberry bog when I was over encumbered &amp; slogging my way out. That encounter chewed threw a lot of my stimpacks.
---
I think I do have shortly after release but I have made so many tickets lol...
---
Well, there is a mod on PC which adds a chat. Very social, good trade and people help each other out a lot.
---
A simple fix is to add SPECIAL scaling to other weapons types, as has been requested many times. 
---
What I have proposed is a classic MMO expansion level cap increase. I understand that this isn't an MMO, but it has similar elements. 
---
By increasing the cap on special stats from 15 to 20, the new average being at 12 makes no difference, considering the previous average was 8. 15-8=7, and 20-12=8. In fact, it actually increases the point disparity by 1. 
---
What did I say Bethesda will do in the future?
---
Its bullshit. Pushing their ppl to hard, to make up for mistakes made by management...resulting in mistake after mistake after mistake. 
---
There is a chat mod for PC, but even if you install it, there is no telling if the other person have it, so it might not help when you want to contact someone specific.
---
Whattttttt which mode? That would make stuff so much better. 
---
You did not. 
---
The person who promoted this comment thread, whose cynicism I suggested is unpleasant to others here, in the context of which you joined, did. 
---
I'd prefer if food and water were actually scarce, but the hunger and thirst meters drained very slowly to compensate.
---
It makes sense to nerf and balance before releasing new content. Imagine if you walk into the new raid / dungeon and one shot it ezpz b/c your guns are totally OP. Or if it's PvP content you have everyone specced the same way using the same weapons because the OP stuff is so dominant.
---
He suggested that SPECIAL affect things that they used to, along with complaining that melee and carry weight go together, which is how it's always been.
---
I'm not saying *literally* everything he complains about was in past games, dude... I'm saying that he very clearly seems to not know how old games were (or maybe forgot if he actually played them).
---
TSE Handmade, Mutant Slayer's black powder rifle, has explosive bullets, +30 damage to super mutants, 90% reduced weight. 
---
If I get desperate, I have a ghoul slayer's western revolver that just does +30 to ghouls, I mainly use it if I am in lowbie areas and am in pa due to weight issues and my mutant slayer's power fist with 40% swing speed, 30% to mutants, and plus 1 strength can't be used. I also use frags and plasma grenades quite a bit. 
---
Yes it would. 
---
I'd share a box of Fancy Lad's for your cake day if I could.  Well done!
---
I have hired people to decorate my camps before! 
---
No one uses hunter hunted tbh even with the recent change, there needs to be more incentive.I'm running a bounty hunting discord to hunt ppl like this if you are interested in being under the protection of it.
---
Sneak vat crit bro. 
---
Blow a fuckin hole in you from 2km away 
---
Also if you kill me, you will instantly die when I spawn. 
---
I don’t think this game is as obsessed with the number 76 as its fanbase are
---
Died today?  I'm still on there.
---
Fuck all.
---
There is nothing more terrorizing than trying to have someone kill you in game to lose your bounty.
---
I have one room locked, it has my bed and C.A.M.P. thingy, and some decorations. Everything else open for use, including a second story room with 3 beds, full acoustic setup, most workbenches (still need to build a power armor bench), water pump and water purifier, and various plants.
---
Check out my posts on water purifiers, it has some useful info. 
---
I'd rather have some awesome opossum bacon. 
---
1-3 per?
---
Based on that idea alone I'm going to buy every semi useful item to annoy those people
---
Seems like Bethesda added a rejoin last server feature for some reason. Makes server hopping annoying because it isn’t a new world. I’ve been closing out the entire game between hops. I tested this by joining a friends server, leaving the world, then just hitting play. I end up in my friends server again. Never teamed up so it wasn’t the play with friend option. 
---
I had to break my habit of picking up every bullet, stack of pre war cash and cigarette I see because there’s no point in selling them anymore.
---
&gt; The fact that you're trying to defend this shit hole reddit is proof I'm right lol
---
No, it's not.  Not at all.  
---
&gt;It seems most fallout fans are self centered brats who are never happy.
---
The only "brat" here seems to be you.
---
I think it's hilarious that you are blaming the state of the game on the fans.  You've lost your grip on reality mate.  Take care, and good luck.
---
If you catch radworms again you should be able to jump like a marsupial again.
---
The only reason I "lock" my door is so that mobs can't just wander in. My solution is to use a keypad door, with the code put right above it.
---
This story could of gone very different if the man was just baiting you into hitting him... and then he kills you because now you initiated combat... heheheh hope noone is getting and ideas.
---
Every time I go into Watoga Emergency Services, first thing I hear is “RETREEEAAAT” 
---
Hey didn't you hear them?  This is YOUR fault.
---
That’s up to you. I never hack terminals or pick locks. I don’t touch Bobby pins
---
&gt;  But there are some pretty serious issues going on here, and most could/should be fixed with a quick patch. 
---
You used the word "serious" to describe the game's issues, and I'm happy to see that.  I have used the same language in the past and got down voted to hell and called a troll. I'm glad to see that people finally realize that yes, these are very serious problems and need to be addressed sooner rather than later.
---
Look there are things that  I do love about the game, and there is fun to be had.  I wouldn't still be playing it were that not the case.  But the game's problems are extremely serious and I only continue playing it with the understanding that these issues will be fixed at some point. 
---
But if they are not addressed, I can't justify continued play of this game.  Bethesda not fixing these problems shows contempt and hostility for their audience. 
---
If they don't fix it, not only is it impossible to justify sinking more time into this game, but future Bethesda games as well.
---
No, that is not "incredibly low tolerance", 3 seconds of 100% packet loss is in fact a surprisingly high tolerance.  
---
There is nothing Bethesda can do to fix your connection not working properly.  
---
Now you can argue that they should up the tolerance to absurd levels, what would your internet connection require? 5 seconds of 100% packet loss? 10 seconds? 20?  
---
At what point do you decide to make the cut-off? Because there will always be some poor soul with awful internet that needs a higher tolerance.  
---
For all their faults and issues with the game, this is not one of them.  
---
Also, ouch, your internet connection must be truly awful :/
---
And legendary shotguns? PSN Sir_cakington
---
Yes. There was a time when ppl used the exp glitch
---
Reverse could be said for you
---
Yes. It's a patched experience exploit.
---
Shhhh
---
I get the shrill ass sonic generator sound cue no matter where I am on the map sometimes, that or the cap collection sound. It’s maddening. 
---
You have a camp at the golf house?? I'd nuke you.
---
Good thing I took Tylenol before reading this. 
---
It's definitely possible even without glitches. But PvP at that level is gonna hurt.
---
I like them 
---
Ugh that made me think of that Nazi in Shindler's List
---
Passionate about food and nutritional anthropology :)
---
It's all Good Eats' fault. Nerdy science + over sized props + cooking ? Did me in
---
The first time I realized I had a problem was when my friend wanted to show me the cute cat that hangs around his base. I walked over and heard it start screaming in agony and promptly die while me and my friend watched in horror. I spend my days now huddled in a corner, never forgetting that cat’s pale lifeless face.
---
Btw cat meat is delicious 
---
Hi will you be online in 3 hours?  I'm currently at work and wont be home any sooner. I am looking to redo my mutations.
---
Reported you to the moderators you sick sick human
---
You dont need those skills in this game. Only for some extra loot you can easily get elsewhere..
---
^*TOGETHEEEER*
---
It’s got issues for sure. Fine for 40 minutes at a time and then 3 seconds or so of packet loss. It’s not a good thing when it happens.
---
But I disagree with your dismissal of the low tolerance claim because other online games do not disconnect given the same circumstances. If it is 10 seconds in other games, then that difference drastically decreases disconnects of this nature.
---
And we know for damn sure that server disconnects ARE one of the issues with this game. The client disconnects after 3 seconds of silence from the server. Sometimes it’s the client not reaching the server (in my case) and sometimes it’s the server not being able to respond to the client in a timely fashion. How much does that happen for the average user?
---
Downvote all you want, but there are "casuals" who were level 100-200+ weeks after release without using any glitches. So yeah, if somebody was grinding nonstop they could easily be that level without using any glitch.
---
I ain't found shit
---
Well, never too late to learn 😎
---
I'm on my 4th char now for the same reason.
---
Check out: http:\\nukesdragons.com
---
Yes, please for the love of all that is holy. I want to scrap the useless ammo so I can make good ammo!
---
I don't get these posts, just drop it. What's everyone's obsession with wanting to sell or scrap. You can already 1000's of any type of ammo for about ten minutes work in the excavator
---
Just try to make sure others get their hits in
---
Yes it is possible but he had to farm whitespring for like 600hours atleast. After all that patches i have problem doing daily level up at 180+. So i think he was more like infinite trap exploit user, but who know. People here like to instantly accuse everyone from duping/haxin/exploting.... 
---
I'm down.  I don't have marathoner but have marsupial.  Make it through a mountain pass to give different builds a shot.  PA could just jump off cliffs but are slow as hell.  The real problem is getting enough people to play.  I'd kind of like to see events like this act like races do in GTAO.  Takes you out of the server while you're in the event.
---
Especially with stealth build... :(
---
Poor guys can't even see you shooting them from 2 feet away.
---
There were "casuals" who were level 100+ a week after release without using any glitches. So yeah, if somebody was grinding nonstop they could easily be that level without using any glitch. Glowing ghouls used to give a lot more xp also. I liked it better that way. Now it's a pain in the butt to level up.
---
Is this the PSX version of the game?
---
Stay in school.
---
I make my friends fist fight naked for guns. Last man standing gets dibs on what I give out. Makes sharing loot more interesting lol
---
I need this kind of service but I desperately need an ELECTRICIAN!
---
If you are reading this and are on Xbox maybe let me know if you are very skilled in running wires and conduits to make things look nice while powering the over abundance of Nuka Cola signs and Stoplights in my Nuka Cola Palace.
---
I was disconnected just a few moments after and couldn't get back to the same server unfortunately. 
---
My daughter is going through post partum depression atm. I actually did tell her to get over herself a couple of days ago. 
---
She is a licensed Social worker with a degree in psychology also. She even recognizes a lot of what she is having problems with, but then she said she can't do anything about it because she hasn't been able to go to her therapist for her to be told how to handle it. That is when I said she needed to get over herself. I grew up in al-ateen, al-anon, and going to more meetings with my father than I can count. The number 1 thing I learned, and has helped me as I have almost died from accidents of different kinds a few times, I also had to deal with kidney disease and because of complications with it, not being able to hold a job is that life sucks, life is not fair, and the only way I can keep on living is to not care about how bad life can be, but to ignore the pain and focus on my family, my dogs, and my hobbies which included being a volunteer firefighter for many years, until my kidney function got too low and I had to medically retire. 
---
I received a kidney transplant on Feb 10, 2018. Believe it or not, since I did not get a live donor match since the only person that could have been a match refused because he is a piece of shit (half brother that I raised the firat 10 years of his life)  It is depressing to think that I am alive and not on dialysis because someone died and was awesome enough to be an organ donor. I have found out that the man was a few years older than me, and left a wife and 2 teenage children behind. I feel depressed every time I think about it. But I also now have the ability to be with my grandson that was born in September. I help my neighborhood out since I do not work by cleaning most of the sidewalks off with my snow blower when it snows. And with anything else I can if they ask. 
---
I know in a lot of my posts I come off as a dick, most of the time it is because I am trying to be funny, but it doesn't come across as such. I will disagree with people quite a bit, and yes, in lot of ways I have become jaded irl, and I sometimes take it out on griefers here, but I honestly never want anyone to be physically harmed. Believe it or not, I usually try to be a nice guy. 
---
Anyway, sorry, this is one of my coping techniques as well. 
---
if you use sentinels armor you are and ass and I will chase you down with vats crits
---
Sry but not knowing theres a level cap in an online fallout game is like going to a nuke zone only in your pants. You can do that, but don't expect good results.
---
Ye i tryied doing alt char like 5times, but quit back to my main after few minutes. Grinding levels to get cap is pain in every game, after you have done it once.
---
Yea I was the same boat. I just learned this a few days ago and had those perks equipped. My friend always told me how she was making bank selling all the cans and pharma stuff and I was like damn I must have bad luck... 
---
&gt; But I still disagree with your dismissal of the low tolerance claim because other online games do not disconnect given the same circumstances. If it is 10 seconds in other games, then that difference drastically decreases disconnects of this nature.  
---
You can disagree all you want, that's fine.  
---
But there is no way you will stay connected to any other online shooter, in an active match, if you stop responding for several seconds.  
---
In your standard WoW-style RPG, sure, they're completely different beasts with very different packets/second and packet importance.  
---
&gt; And we know for damn sure that server disconnects ARE one of the issues with this game. The client disconnects after 3 seconds of silence from the server. Sometimes it’s the client not reaching the server (in my case) and sometimes it’s the server not being able to respond to the client in a timely fashion. How much does that happen for the average user?  
---
Servers not responding is a problem for sure, but upping the tolerance does nothing to fix that.  
---
We already have a situation where the servers are unstable and laggy (As you point out), the unfortunate issues you're having with your connection does not help, but upping the tolerance would also not help.  
---
Best case scenario, it'd hide it, and you'd rubberband all over the place while enemies "heal up" until you get killed during a lagspike.. The problem itself is still there: Packets not coming through.  
---
In any online game developers have to set a cutoff where it's no longer reasonable/feasible for a client that is not responding to "come back" so to speak. The amount of time, and the number of events that can have occurred is just too great.  
---
You have a very good / near perfect build.. I have action boy instead of stagger gun but Else the same. You just need a weapon a bit Better.
---
The why is easy... With 15 str and 15 int you can swap in and out of melee or heavy gun as needed. If you want to craft stuff - swap a few. Want to farm a lot - swap a few. Easy peasy 😎
---
😠
---
Well if your ever at Slocum's Joe glance over to the Nuka Cola sign next door and see if I am on the server. I set up my Nuka Palace on that sign. 
---
There is a RNG related theory being investigated that suggests different 
---
this is a great idea, since spawning in an event like this would bypass any more spawning timers. 
---
I'm going to take a guess and say that maybe this was taken before all of the graffiti was done there. It's highly likely that they removed all of it in post and added a horrific amount of HDR, but I don't think anyone would want to spend that much time removing it if they didn't have to.
---
If you are refering to the seeded loot theory, then idk, i dont feel convinced that it is true just based off of my experience
---
Scripting is coding. If  you don't know that then you're the one that never made a mod for a Bethesda game.
---
When you make a model, you have just that, a model. You then have to assign it a texture directly on the .nif or "attaching" it from a BSA file. That will make the item visually complete (unless it has animation, which you will have to rig). That is an item, then you have to assign stats for the time, this is not made by the people who make models or textures.
---
Assigning stats requires the use of a SDK. Stats are things like DR and other resistances for armor, weight, durability, abilities, ammo, how much it heals, how much it reduces hunger, how much it reduces thirst, how much you get from scraping it, etc. Then you have to go and place that item in any Lists that are relevant to them, so they appear in enemies, on containers, as drops, etc. Then (as in the case you so happily skipped in my previous post) you have to code new blocks of code for new stuff like those Unstoppables costumes HP bonuses, then have to code to add the items to the Atom store (another thing you conveniently turned a blind eye at in my previous post) as shown in that Power Armor Headlights being added to the Atom store code picture, I posted.
---
All of this SDK job, coding, adding stats and abilities ARE NOT what 3D and other artists are paid to do. It's not just making a model and it's done. If you really believe that, then you have no idea what you're talking about and just spew whatever nonsense you believe in. So don't expect any more replies from now on. I'm too busy actually making mods to waste more time teaching the basics on how this stuff works. 
---
And you are welcome to join any TTW community, if you want to see if I make mods or not. I've been helping making one of the biggest FNV modding projects ever since the split (when RFCW team split and TTW was born).

Have a good day.

They aren't quitting, fool. They block you and move on. You accomplish nothing.

Screws are easy to find. There's two places you can go to get them that is literally by each other. One place is a satellite dish that usually have super mutants there. The other place have a bunch of scorch. You can go to both places and get a bunch of typewriters, telephones, etc. Walked away with 40 + screws on one trip
---
The loot from lockpick and hacking isnt't worth it. You may pick additional cards after completing you build - this usually happens after lv 60
---
these usually go for 10k btw
---

---
Awesome! Well done!
---
I'd like to see traditional MMO style content, like instanced 4 man dungeons, with loot tables, and named, unique legendaries worth a shit. I hate the trend of unique legendaries just being filler before you get a good RNG drop with no name or lore.
---
Could it be an idea to automatically change the name when a chest part is used?
---
So, as soon as a T-60 chest is in use, it‘s called „Power Armor T-60“. Either way, it would help a lot just not to have 3 identical named items.
---
It really can't. I think you're playing up the severity with made-up details.
---
Great idea that's been echoed for some time now, but, uh, let's give the patch programmers a bit of time to focus on one thing at a time. Every other feature they put in, something breaks. I wouldn't put it past them to accidentally make 'Scrap All' destroy all your equipment off and leaving you naked in exchange for this deal.
---
Let them put in the 'lock items so they can't be sold/scrapped' feature first.
---
Cool, thanks man. And thanks for not biting my head off. 
---
XB1
---
not sure, wouldn't be surprised. Taking a break for now 
---
I won't, it's 3am here. Lol
---
Been in there with 5, robots were not the issue, couldn't remove mainframe cores till 6 minutes after getting in that room
---
Heh, keeping me out would be building fortifications, that was just a mess of a pile, as somebody else mentioned I could just drill through and only get like a 10 to 20 cap bounty, so much for keeping out..
---
I mean, I was amused. 
---
Deffinitly, something needed. 
---
Vote one for scraping ammo 
---
Vote two for selling / scraping legendaries items
---
The game isn't shy about cannibalism. There's a perk directly associated with it, and you'll often get glowing meat from glowing ones, too. I think it's quite safe to assume that in the case of mole miners, it's human flesh. 
---
non stackable items will always need there own unique key, thats why the stash should have an item limit, not a wheigt limit. The personal stash of a player is a table in the database which is accesible with the foreign key from the player database. Ressources and other stackables have there own table and get linked with there key as a foreign key. In another column there is the amount of this ressource.
---
, you dont even need to save the name in this table, because you can get with the foreign key and a join with the other table. 
---
Sorry yesterday didn’t get a single disconnect in three hours of play.
---
Might be other things at play out of the hands of Bethesda such as network load and how far the servers are from you. 
---
Everything that shoots rockets at me or tries to rip off my dick deserves to die
---
That's definitely my headcanon now. We've seen no indication of what happened to the children of Appalachia otherwise; there's no corpses of children anywhere, no scorched kids. That they became mole miners is the most reasonable assumption. 
---
Get a powerarmor, duh...
---
PA + sledgehammer = no problems.
---
I didn’t understand any of this 
---
&gt; sad little dudes 
---
I think they're sad little kids. You know. The toys.
---
I mean, BGS is actually a pretty small team, especially for being a AAA studio with so many successful games under their belt. They've only got 400ish employees in total, the majority of which I'm guessing have moved on to working on Starfield, Blades, and even early production for TES6. 
---
Best case, I'd guess that all of BGS Austin is still on 76 to maintain it for the foreseeable future with members from other teams chipping in as they're able to.
---
Here.
---
Where?
---
Mole miners could be NPCs...
---
They're surprisingly versatile. You'll often find them wielding rocket launchers or shotguns, but if you close to melee range with them, they'll usually strap on these big grisly gauntlets which they'll use to stab and parry as they scurry around your waistline. Nasty, nasty little things. 
---
That's an awesome dark origin for the mole miner
---
Overseer states that they are "not human", which makes me think that they really are. You can eat mole miners with cannibalism perk, and AI in uranium fever refers to them as "terminated management personnel". 
---
So it's most likely that mole miners are just humans in bad condition. Unlike feral ghouls they can still use and even craft weapons, so they are not completely braindead. And their aggressiveness towards player might be simply because of how miners were mistreated before the war.
---
So yeah. We are kinda heartless murderers. We are the true monsters of Appalachia.
---
I currently sit at 45 strength. I will gladly take another 5 for that 25 more carry weight. Almost as much carry weight as a stash box.
---
There are like 10 glowing onec if you are lucky, the rest are just scorched or supermutands. not wort it, not even for flora.
---
The biggest obstacle for these criteria is the ‘lots of players’ part. There is no official or logical hub for players, I mean, I find myself gravitating towards Flatwoods a lot because it has a vendor and Brahmin for meat, I see players there quite a bit, but never too many. One thing I’d say we need is the ability to broadcast server-wide, at least in some basic form. Maybe the option to show our camp location on the map with an option for camps main intent: food, resources, rest stop, trade post, water, etc.?
---
How? I get no XP or loot from any of the Whitesprings bots. 
---
Why keep so many in your inventory? I put all other ones in the stash for later use
---
Yes, but I dont understand why would you want to lock your base.
---
No one can steal anything, and if I want to destroy you camp I dont need to get in.
---
Does it, though?
---
Personally I appreciate the effort of sharing. I doubt I'll use it since I'm always low on violet flux, but I can see a scenario in which it would be useful. 
---
Personally, I just capture Thunder Mountain, set up a generator there and then go fix myself a bite to eat or watch something on Netflix on my laptop while the game continues on my PS4, picking up new fusion cores every ten minutes or so until I have the 20 or thereabouts that I like to have before continuing on. 
---
Yeah they changed the mob spawns at whitesprings a couple of weeks ago. Its strange and it doesnt really fit the story.
---
Everyday I see great quality of life suggestions, and every day im reminded 99% of them will never happen. 
---
Hahaha
---
I've never understood why ppl lock stuff up in this game, it just causes ppl to level the place with a fat man and not be carrying caps
---
the only one that increased in weight when bulked was acid, and that was because it was an edge case -- the bulk weight was equal to the weight of fifteen acid, but you only needed ten acid to create bulk acid. they made it 15/15, but, before, bulking was a great way to generate more acid spontaneously. ~~it also technically wasn't heavier than unbulked, since it was the correct weight for and equal to 15 acid.~~
---
Yep i have learned the ability to craft combat dense mods. Can i now? NOPE
---
lmao. Someone give OP a cookie, don't worrt buddy. I ain't leaving either.
---
Well. How lucrative? I've got one in my stash. I'm interested in barters, not caps.

Mole miners piss me off because they have missile launchers. Nothing like getting a face full of missiles :/
---
There's two spots at Whitesprings which are especially good for getting crimson flux. There's an area near to the service entrance with a bunch of dumpsters full of skeletons and loads of fungus, which gives red flux. 
---
Also, see the green bus near to the doors [in this image](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/3/31/The_Whitespring_Resort.png/revision/latest?cb=20181130212116)? Right behind it is a little area that dips underground one floor. There's a load of aster plants there which give crimson flux. There's actually a fair bit of aster within a short distance of the spot where this image was taken. Next time you're at the Whitesprings, scout out this area for aster flowers, and then keep them in mind the next time the area gets nuked. 
---
HahahahahahaHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAA!?

---
Mod your armor chest to have a dense mod. You won’t even notice scorchbeast ranged damage anymore. It’s like slap damage.
---
I understand that but it’s more of an analogy, that mobs are consistently higher than they should be over weapons 
---
I know. Unfortunately tse duping kinda complicated things unnecessarily
---
i used to be a tse user. The nerf happened, i changed around my perks. Dropped the tse and became a bloody explosive user. Things are as they were. The dps is wicked. 
---
My point. move on and adapt.
---
Hey thanks for the reply, I am going to give this a try tonight.
---
By cost, you mean weight? The weight per mini nuke and missle makes sense logically, holding on to them for no reason just because does not. 
---
I, on the other hand, looted total of 8 TwoShot weapons across 300+ hours, ans 5 of those were dropped in a single location within 1h timeframe. I'm not saying that rng seed is something that is correctly understood, I'm just past the point of not believing its existence.
---
Also, being honest, fuck RNG. Worst part of the game. I think its honestly simply shitty that a ghoul intestines is a better source of items than masterful crafters. Legendary crafting is a must IMO.
---
Haha you raiders try too hard.
---
Start by uninstalling. Voila! No more bugs!!
---
Carefully crafting a weapon, properly securing everything with screws.
---
And then dropping it from a roof to scrap it.
---
there is more ppl to stay in game than u think :) and prolly most of ppl that 'quit' still playing
---
F76 has a charity pie on the roof of West Tek.
---
No it doesn't.. How the fuck does a protectron get diseased.. What next, glowing assaultrons
---
Somehow they always remind me of Ewoks.
---
I never said such thing, this particular player is giving his experience with the game. Im simply replying with a different experience from me and my party. Should i have not replied unless i intended to agree? If thats the case, i don't agree. 
---
New headcanon. 
---
Damn man! I have always wondered if I would still relish the joys of gaming when I turn 76. Glad to know the dream is still out there!
---
You know that Bethesda will force you to write an essay or stop playing the game for using mods?
---
I find plenty of violet around prime, so I'm never short. I've had workshops go side ways on me lots of time, so I find bother with them.
---
*Mole Minor
---
virus
---
&gt;Yes, but I dont understand why would you want to lock your base.
---
&gt;No one can steal anything, and if I want to destroy you camp I dont need to get in.
---
You can steal from material generators and water purifiers, etc if you don't lock them
---
They can get in that way but how do they get out? This was what I learned. I put my Power Armor outside, jumped on top, then used the crafting bench. I was a dummy and I picked up my PA. Maybe I could have teleported back out using it. So I had to pick the lock to get back out. Then I found I like having a bounty. Thanks guy for trying to keep me out. You made me a permanent Wanted. Now I will destroy your turrets no hesitation.
---
They’re the perfect embodiment of me at a party and I hear/see Jell-O shots
---
Build with aprox dam values (im doing this by memory, I can confirm numbers later)
---
Sniper = hardened sniper rifle with 166 dam
---
Shotgun = combat shotgun with 190 dam
---
Gauss rifle = 260 dam
---
All rise = 190 dam
---
Spare weapons = 
---
Spiked black diamond = 160 dam
---
Vampire black powder rifle = 360 dam
---
Perfect storm = 60 dam (for low levels)
---
Fat man = 490 dam (just in case)
---
Armor:
---
Various types of armor. Between combat armor, deep pocketed marine armor and a legendary metal chest piece that withstands 113 dam. All in all if I remember correctly it goes around 200+ dam resist. 
---
I wear sniper hat (from the atom shop) and the enclave general suit. For style the patrolman sunglasses. :)
---
PA:
---
I have the 3 main PAs already. Ultracite, excavator level 45 and the jet packed X01.
---
Perk cards:
---
Focused on shotgunner, rifleman and agility cards.
---
Must have for rifle/shotgun build: enforcer and tormentor!
---
I invested a lot of points in cards like super duper, hard bargain, melee and weight decrease.
---
well... then lock them but not the door so players can use your work benches &amp; stash box.
---
Yeah I still have tedious stuff to grind like Charleston random vendor.
---
You could initially, then they patched it.
---
That doesn't count, she's not even new.
---
If you're on Xbox One I'm sitting on about 700 if you want some? I just can't help picking up desk fans, typewriters and silver lockets. My tag is Imhidingshh, just msg I'll be on in an hour or so. 
---
Make game work perfect first then yes to this lol
---
Cool
---
Mole miners are the only major mob with no legendary weapon against them. 
---
It doesnt the fit the story according to the holotapes found at whitesprings. Supposedly the ghouls found all around the place are from the people who turned into ghouls. Thats what I got from the story. Some were killed by the robots (skeletons found in the dumpsters outside), but some residents didnt leave and blocked themselves in the place and in time turned into ghouls due to rad exposure.
---
Yeah but they drop black titanium so *BLAM* *BLAM* *ALAM*
---
Reading comprehension is hard 
---
no
---
I'm merely correcting some misinformation 
---
You do you
---
Probably because the game isn't working 🤣
---
I am so glad someone else made this correlation. That is exactly what they remind me of! Those Ghost People freaked me out and the Mole Miners freak me out too. The weird wheezing and grunts give me the willies. 
---
The colour scheme is giving me more of a Bioshock feel honestly.
---
I love fallout but after this last patch the game is borderline unplayable. Between freezes and trying to find a server where my camp location is available, I’ve spent the last 30 minutes attempting to begin playing
---
- freezes when you open Pip-Boy too soon
---
- spawned in and attacked by invisible enemies while running around waiting for my camp to show up... then it freezes
---
In 3 and new Vegas it was obvious. 100 was the top. Special only went up to 10 so when I put it to 11. I didn’t think there was a cap obviously 
---
It is more just the principle of it. I don't care for the PVP myself. And It doesn't matter if the building is locked or not, I used to leave all my stuff unlocked and jerks that all they care about is destroying other peoples things or trying to get pvp initiated will level the house just because. I still think you shouldn't be able to activate through a window. Just a personal option.
---
I didn’t know you could take perks after level 50...
---
Arguably, minions are already plenty mutated...
---
I didn’t know that...
---
I believe option number 2
---
The game has become junk farming dude. 
---
I can run down a mob but fuck, the junk farming after that shit man. I don’t wanna play no more. 
---
I feel bad killing them because I know what happened.   The miners fused to the suits while underground because of radiation?
---
So they used to be people once.
---
I had hoped to collect all the hats in the game but that idea quickly went out the window with the stash limit.
---
Thanks
---
Thanks 
---
&gt; quit
---
&gt; still here
---
First thing first, this is a game, not real life. A lot of people die when you put three bullets in their heads, but weirdly it doesn't matter in FO76. 
---
Second point; let's say we can't use screws from a shotgun to fix a sniper rifle, I should still be able to use the screws of a shotgun to build another shotgun. Not to mention pipe rifles, which are literally junk put together.
---
As per the screws stripping, that's why nobody asks to recover every single component needed to craft an item when you scrap it, but it's both annoying AND ridiculous that you retrieve a bit of metal and some rubber when you dismantle a gun. I don't blow it up, I take it to my specialized workshop to take it apart, piece by piece.
---
Honestly, my favorite would be the possibility to fix a weapon with a similar weapon when in the wild; like the (only) good idea of FO3. That shit was dope.
---
Sorry, I am a newbie.
---
That could get interesting. People want to come by and trade. Someone starts busting the place up. People like the trader and fight the one busting things. War!
---
what are you on about? people are mostly complaining about the plethora of previously fixed bugs and duping coming back
---
DB solution only for stash or for any containers on the map?
---
Fuck Juicehead.

perfectly preserved cookie

---
You can spawn a new item with it's item id, but it then gets an entity id. It has to else tue engine wouldn't know the difference between hat A and hat B. But whether or not that persists into the persistent database in F76 is what is not clear.
---
Either I activate through the window or I pick the lock or blow the door off its hinges with a shotgun. It's your choice.
---
Ah, that part of it, yes, I see.
---
Can you send me screen shots of your inventory, psn is mario_will_die 
---
Ouch.
---
Huh?
---
It's percentage based just like Nerd Rage, etc. If you're asking if a high END (ie: high HP) build will be able to do more damage the answer is no. You'll just have a few more HP.
---
Test it yourself, it's pretty easy: take the serum and you'll have no max HP penalty for an hour. Check your 49% damage. Wait an hour for the penalty to kick in. Repeat. Do these steps in the opposite order if you already have the mutation, of course. ;)
---
It would be nice from Beth if we could write signs. Id put one  saying "take the water, but leave at least one bottle". Ahah
---
Seriously, I dont mind ppl taking my water. When I log in usually the purifiers spawn full and I take everything before I leave my camp. Same thing with my crops.
---
If I happwn to stumble upon another players camp and it happens to have purifiers I never take everything. It just being polite. But I understand how frustrating it must to arrive at your camp and the purifiers or crops are empty.
---
it scales with % of health, so it's irrelevant how many HP you have ;) also use adrenal reaction mutation, it grants the same effect &amp; stacks with bloodied
---
Thats actually really cool. 
---
I think your confusing hdr with saturation. hdr would be a good thing(if your display can show it), saturation just blows out the colors.
---
It's worse. All they have done is increase the grind, bugs from launch are still here, they brought back previously fixed bugs. Don't buy it
---
This drives me crazy when realtors do this, I can't even look at it. They blow it out so much, every photo has a white halo around the edging of the house. I don't give a fuck how textured the paneling is, ooh look at how vibrant the sky and trees are, better get a house there! 
---
Is it to make it seem like its better than it is? Most people will visit the house before buying it, so you aren't fooling anyone. There are better ways to bring colour out in a photo if it's feeling flat or boring. 
---
What? He described a weight decrease though
---
I originally read the title as grifted and was expecting to hear a story about an amazing bamboozle.
---
Like I said, as long as it amuses me, it's the best use of the $60 I spent on this piece of crap.
---
Man I loved reading this! Very engaging and funny!

Nope. I for one will not buy ES6 nor Starfield unless they are worthy of my money and time. I will wait for reviews, gameplay videos etc. If the same buggy mess continues I won't buy it. I've lost faith in the developer
---
I do. Quite often at work but they're in a box. So I suppose it's bulked. 
---
People do vote with their wallets... just look at the recent Battlefield 5 fiasco
---
I'm totally cool with you doing you, as long as we agree that nobody cares the slightest about your sad little adventure.
---
I mean those are the questions that I found answers for before I purchased my preorder, building a fallout character without any prior research should end up as mess
---
You Enclave soldier boys will end up falling to the light of our lord and saviour the mothman!
---
That's a whole lot of text describing problems mitigated in week.... 1?
---
Fireproof now has an anti-explosive buff. Use it and/or find a Dense chest mod. Bathe in Scorchbeast glow with no staggers and little, if any, damage.
---
Scorchbeasts, including Queenie, now land regularly even if they aren't crippled. Some bug/combination of bugs/Bethesda causes it to often not happen. Cripple it to at least stop the screaming if you want, but generally moving around will eventually ..... well, something different will happen. Hopefully something better. But at least something different.... Bethesda.
---
Speaking of cripple, add Enforcer and get a shotgun. It doesn't matter if you're melee, afraid of loud noises, or not perked for shotguns: all you need is Enforcer and the ability to hit a flying barn. The thing will be crippled pretty quickly at _at least_ stop screaming but most likely also landing. **This is your new (yet very old) OP strategy**. Once they land you can plink away with whatever you want including bloodied melee weapons.
---
Oh no, I was just adding on to the previous comments about HDR. I'm well aware of the difference between the two, but to be fair, I am looking at this on my phone, so it probably looks quite different than it would look on my desktop.
---
This has ruined the Scorchbeast Queen fight twice for me. After rinsing all my ammo and also my fucking time going through the silo on my own, it's enough to make me step back from the game until everything is fixed. I have no doubt this game will pull a No Man's Sky. I had No Man's Sky from launch and like everyone else, I was disappointed when I first played it so I took a step back and waited until they released the NEXT update and now it's an amazing game. I'm doing the same with 76 
---
Simply not far enough!!! We also need no direct contro,l and plenty of quite time events! Also dating like on of those strange Japanese dating Sims!!!! 
---
Great, thank you!
---
I never really found an issue with this frankly, I have a farm and a couple of water purifiers at my camp so I'm never short of food and water
---
They really aren't. There's just a huge imbalance in weapons right now (and probably for the life of the game).
---
Plasma rifle sucks, plasma flamer is amazing, Enforcer's time-to-cripple is mysteriously seconds while One Gun Army flat out barely works, the Gatling is OP but every other heavy gun is for sleeping, and melee.... Well... Melee.
---
Seems like everybody who belittles griefing has 200+ hours in the game, so they’re probably level 150 which means of course nobody will grief you. 
---
Try being level 9 and I guarantee that the same shitfuck griefer will try to kill you, at least on NA servers. 
---
What makes PVP so unbalanced is when a level 60 or a level 120 starts attacking me at level 10. There’s no chance, not a single chance in hell that I can win a fight like that, so it becomes a perverse game for high-level psychos where low-level casuals like me become horror film victims. That’s not fun. That’s not the game I signed up for. 
---
There's no way that in a post apocalyptic universe ammo can't be used as a currency. However each round shouldn't be worth more than one cap as in Fallout 4. Between 0.1 caps or lower for .38 ammo and say 0.5 or lower for 2mm EC. The only ammo I could see being worth more than that are missiles and mini nukes.
---
Big oof
---
Honestly I always saw them as angry midgets with shotguns and never gave it a second thought.
---
i wouldnt have done the damn quest a single time if it would’ve been even a little more frustrating. i did it twice, once for my main and while helping my friend with his alt, he had to do it three times, once for each of his characters and once while helping me through the quests the first time and we were both so done with it
---
Yup, that one!
---
Then some guy comes along in a blue suit dressed as a clown, kills his friends and rip the suit parts off their now, lifeless bodies
---
Right? There would be a reason to use Egghead, Internal Database, etc. At minimum, let my energy weapons get a damage buff on repair like melee does.
---
I did one violent night yesterday and got a 3*legendary glowing wendigo but it's corpse disappeared into the floor of the stage before I could loot it of course I logged out right there and then.
---
I saw a theory on here once (idk how I would find it) that in the Fallout universe some Miners were literal Minors and that the they had mutated and got stuck in the suits and that’s why they’re small
---
No one tell this person how STR works...
---
Keep in mind that NMS also recovered.
---
I stuck with my first, worst decision of my life, he's so close to being fixed now it's easier to stick with him, if only I made the better decision earlier.
---
They look like they’ve got the Scorched Plague.
---
Chill dude, they already said the auto-detection only flags you if you duped over 500,000. 
---
Sweet - from now on, all kills will be proclaimed as /u/Vishimtar approved
---
Problem is you have six separate pieces with additional possible mod a piece. How do you list all those in the inventory menu. 
---
Or don't be a dick.
---
I like to crouch and AFK in my house if I gotta step away for a little bit. I’ve seen mole rats open doors that aren’t locked at a workshop one time. Idk if that was a fluke bug or what but it happened, so I always keep the door to my actual house locked so I don’t get ambushed during AFK. I leave the resource extractor, water purifier and garage with all my crafting stations unlocked for other players to find and use though. 
---
Oh that really sucks :-(
---
I mean it happened to me to, there were Mutants demolishing a base somewhere and when I saw it I went over to kill them. I guess one of the bullets hit some wall and thus I became wanted just for helping. Ofc this is bad, but player leveling your base for pure grief? This is the kind of stuff that would make me wanna quit this game. I play with my parents who are both over 60. It's really funny, running around doing missions together - but I don't think they will get the concept of griefing 12 year olds destroying what they worked for, for shits n giggles... oh my.
---
I'm not being a dick. I need to use a stash or workbench. They are being a dick putting a lock on it.
---
RE radworms, just relog.
---
WTF did I just read

Same! 
---
Maybe you could make a sign with the wall letters (not the neon ones... unless you have those too) and maybe the Gas Station sign or something. I put “FREE JUNK” on the junk extractor at my camp using those black and white wall letters, lol. 
---
Bro I'm on mobile and new to using reddit, I don't even know how to get to my own history, the most I know how to do is some basic formatting.
---
As someone who suffers from mild psychosis due to being abused by my parents for the first 20 years of my life, I am prone to anxiety, anger, irrational thoughts, and overall suffer daily from the pain that is inconsiderateness, apathy, and cruelty, the only real buff in life I got is my creativity, intelligence (arguably...), and, ah, that's actually it, but my point is:
---
I didn't need to copy and paste any reply to you, if you found it ironically after *you* said something similar, then that's just life reflecting what you gave back at you, the really funny part is it took me, a mentally ill person, to send it back to you.
---
Does that reflect on you or me?
---
I think it's both as I too have failed to properly read what others have said and have given poor responses as a result.
---
I hope you will see that you too have done this, and will try to be more considerate of what decency there is in others instead of letting our judgment get in the way.  Something I have failed to do time and again.
---
Hey, that was my team! I've sent you a friend request.  We LOVE meeting other players who build creative and realistic camps. You have a great build and we would be more than happy to swing by for another visit any time!
---
Honesty time. You weren't using a mic and I was wondering if it was a trap base at first. Pleasantly surprised to see an awesome camp, instead!
---
No, it definitely prevents damage being done to you. Turning it on prevented any forther damage being done by the griefer. I've never had anyone do pvp damage to any of my camps but it seems worth looking in to. Would be nuts for Bethesda to have a PvP toggle that didn't protect your CAMP but I haven't checked. 
---
okay. not my point at all... but thanks for trying
---
Not surprising at all. Scorchbeast Queen uses the same animations and behavioral patterns as dragons from Skyrim. Scorched animations heavily resemble draugr's. 
---
I recommend taking:  Adamantium Skeleton (Endurance), Gun Fu (Agility, and Luck Perk for Rifles that Cripple (forgot name). 
---
Gun Fu (rank 1) works really well with Grim Reaper's.
---
As for Perception, take Rifleman (rank 1), Elite Rifleman (rank 1) and Master Rifleman (rank 1) instead of rank 3 rifleman.   First rank of each card gives +10% dmg for a total of 30%.  Rifleman Rank 3 only gives a total of 15%.
---
As for the handmade, it is superior to the hunting rifle because the handmade has many more mods, has great rate of fire, ammo capacity and reload times.   Put a hardened Receiver in the Handmade and it should out perform your hunting rifle.
---
The lever action rifle must not be as well modded as your hunting rifle.  I read that the lever action is comparable to the handmade, so with decent mods, it should be above your hunting rifle.  
---
Also keep in mind the mods for guns have hidden stats like the amount of AP use and accuracy when sighted.  If going for long range, mod with Long Barrel (+sighted accuracy, +more AP cost).   If you are going mid-short range, mod with the short barrel (+hip-fire accuracy and less AP useage).  AP becomes important for the VATs-Criticals.
---
I also run with Bloody Mess for additional +15% damage.
---
BTW, at 100% condition with my crafted handmade, it's damage rating is 213.  
---
Nope, they used the old trap disarm exploit.
---
No, that would improve the game.
---
Post
---
I thought you could have 15 on all your specials, till it started dishing out perk cards instead of spec points. By then it was too late to sort it out.
---
Downvotes proving my point. See what i mean? Man i love the internet. 
---
The pleasant valley train station has a junk pile on the other side of the road it gets a ton of traffic due to players doing the main story going to the top of the world as well as many players use that spot for their raider vendor it’s on a large road that’s flat and easy and nice to build on when I was there I never got attack by anything major a few rats or wolves sometimes but it was rare. If you don’t need an extractor setting up shop by the white springs station will give you heavy traffic as every one goes there at least once a day to trade and uranium fever brings every one there. 
---
And either way I had like at most 3 bobbleheads of a kind and no doubles of anything else.
---
I just have a lot of stuff lol
---
Yah I love doing this all the time. My favorite places to leave loot is the Charleston Station suitcase or cash register, Watoga suitcases, and the cash register in the crafting room at Whitesprings.  I leave thousands of scavenged and crafted bullets, legendaries, and tons of plans.  I like thinking that it is paying it forward and helping others enjoy their game and forging a cooperative environment.  
---
Tho I will say not to be greedy. If you don't need those legendaries, please don't just take them to sell them for caps or w/e. Someone else might be able to use that stuff. 
---
Give it a few weeks and it will be nerfed at the rate they are going.
---
Explosives aren't affected by DR for some reason because that's just how things work I guess.  This means the only defense against it is the fireproof perk, dense armor mod, and the assassin legendary effect.  Stacking assassin legendaries is some real bullshit that you can't get around but it and the dense mod restrict the player from using PA.  This means anyone in PA is fair game for getting homed in on with heat seeking missiles.  The targeting computer mod for the missile launcher is so damn good.  You just fire two or three shots and watch as the fly right at the person and wreck em.  The fireproof perk does help but not enough on its own.
---
But yeah, the assassin effect is bullshit because you can get a full set and pretty much negate most damage done to you.  However the whole of PVP in this game is bullshit as well.  It's way too easy to one shot people.  Nothing about PVP is balanced in this game.  The only thought that went into PVP was requiring both players engage each other before full damage is done but that just makes issues of it's own since whoever shoots first is always at a disadvantage as the second person can just take their time and one shot you.
---
I helped my brother and sister in law do their first solo run yesterday. He asked where people normally drop these and I said “white springs or fissure site prime but you can more or less put in anywhere”.
---
So he drops it on my camp and totally levelled it!
---
The repair list was long as my arm. We did laugh about it after though.
---
You baited us with „something fun“ 
---
And it wasn’t anything fun at all D:
---
The players will never get behind this idea but it IS a good idea. I say let them enjoy the game, bugs and all for the remainder of its life span and just implement a test server to first test patches before implementing them. In the meantime the game can't get any worse, right?
---
So, how's it different when the gamer tag floats over characters?
---
People... it JUST works.. when you scrap a weapon or armor piece irl, you dont get screws either.. or do you now? ;)
---
*complaints about the story being uninvolved and boring*     
---
gets a quest created to involve the player in a joke that (everyone understands) 
---
*complains about the story being too tedious and frustrating*
---
Scavenger hunt or hide and seek are things I've done with different teammates at times.  One thing I'd like to do is hide a legendary weapon somewhere in a defined area and have people see if they can find it.  Watoga would be awesome for that.  
---
Well OP screwed up the only part that you have only 1 attempt at. Clearly his fault. Putting in the nuke codes correctly is not that hard.
---
And for navigation, you have the quest marker. Its not an easy quest, surely it takes some time and effort. Preparing for a nuke launch is kinda the endgame quest, did OP really expect it to be easy task?
---
Disconnects, bugs and other issues sucks, ill give you that.
---
I dont see the point of it not being rewarding. Even the robos walking up to the terminals readying up for launch was really cool to see. The  Nuke hitting is always a spectacle. Well the queen could reward you a bit more thats true. But tbh i really enjoy fighting her. 
---
I swear whoever sends air drops is good at aiming.https://i.imgur.com/W8fXUoA.png
---
I don't feel like delete should be a thing (,unless you have a full perk card stack
---
but an archive option, maybe..... but it has been brought up many times, half of these cards should be active when crafting only/ as a crafting deck separate to exploring deck
---
You just have to wait. I know that sounds dismissive, but that's it. For whatever reason some two patches ago this has become a thing.
---
Just stand there and wait. You can look around to see the buildings and CAMPs or vendors pop in but don't move, open the pip boy, etc. Just sit there for a while. It's worse in high traffic/high CAMP areas (like Whitesprings) but also happens in Watoga, etc.
---
sitting there for 10 mins and running back and forth for half an hour is not very immersive and you can probably agree with that. there was always another player just as frustrated as my friend and i was
---
So i just have to let my character stand there for 10 minutes? I am now at the point where my character is near starvation and dehydration, so a strong chance i will die if i do this. 
---
I honestly think this game has lost me all goodwill i had towards the Fallout franchise, and i may just give up on it.
---
But you'll be sad when you finally get an animated one and can't level it up. Unless you have the animated one and then you can just be sad.
---
Sadness all around.
---
They should abandon it.... and let mods create private servers. They would do a better job in a week than Bethesda did the past 3 months.
---
Yes? 10 minutes might be excessive but .... Yeah, that's probably what you might have to do.
---
Whitesprings has robots, player camps, ghouls, etc cluttering up the area. When you are finally able to play remember to logout in a less busy area.
---
It's BS. I know. It sucks. But that's how it works for now. :\
---
Yes well. Can I take back my last message. 2 CTD and 3 DC in 30 min.
---
Hmm.
---
It is a busy time so I still think it’s the network. 
---
Near whitespring trainstation. It's open and flat and many go there 😁
---
It seems the launcher is only used for updates and to store your credentials.  You can start the game from the executable.  You must input your acct name and PWD every time but this works well and I have seen any drawbacks doing this way since the B.E.T.A.
---
Rediculously strong compared to what exactly.? What aren't you stronger than already besides end game monsters?
---
Besides most people would just dump "passive" skills like crafting and lock picking skills into those extra points. To avoid switching them out all the time. 
---
I did that the other day :P with my clothes on, but I left a paper bag containing spoiled vegetables and dirty water. Hopefully the owner got it.
---
Yeah I agree. While fighting them I’ve been able to make out a few things like when they attack you with their fist they’ll say things like “Please just leave” or “Why are you doing this?”
---
I was laughing my a** off! That mission is hilarious, truly.
---
There are NA servers? 
---
I usually have stash boxes outside the building. But I just feel that is should be my space. I could be wrong but do you leave your real house unlock for people to come raid your frig, pop down on the couch watch your tv. I thought this game was suppose to attract a little of the role playing crowd, but it seems more dicks play this game than anyone else.
---
Really? How silly? How will it change the game? You will be a one shot shooter and a one shot hitter. Big deal.
---
I respectfully disagree. I played FFXIV at launch and it was a complete mess. Hell, it had to make a freaking server all to open the local game menu. If the servers were overloaded you could've had to wait upwards of a minute to even change your audio/video settings. That alone was a dealbreaker for me and doesn't even get into the numerous other technical issues that game had. 
---
Honestly, it rivaled FO76's launch with the exception that they never made the mistake of merging a patch into an old build and releasing it.
---
The mirelurks kings are damn annoying, they’re the greatest bulletsonges I’ve ever seen in all my life
---
Thanks for this! Funny French accent she has too. 
---
Bought arena, daggerfall, morrowind, oblivion and Skyrim. I bought fallout 3, r and NV. I didn't buy this one and unless Starfield gets (unbiased) out of this world reviews (like seriously upgraded creation engine)I won't be buying that either.
---
No, because I have no way to communicated you and as far as I know you might steal/launch my nuke.
---
Personally, I check in to see if the devs have managed to fix and revive the game. Example, The Division 1. Launched in a lackluster state, I quit playing but monitored the sub. When the sub started talking about the new content actually being decent, I reinstalled the game and came back. Hoping the same will happen here...eventually
---
Just build a camp near a junk pile, ezpz. 
---
Anything to stop me having to switch to my virtual MTG set to allow me to play the FPS/3DP Survival game I bought. 
---
Thanks for your help, it is appreciated. Just thankful that the game was a gift, so I didn't spend £60 on this. 
---
Yep, just realized I needed to free up space on my game SSD, saw FO76 was still installed and finally clicked uninstall. I was hoping it'd continue improving enough to warrant me leaving it installed until it was fixed, but Patch 5 pushed me over the edge. The game player in me can't understand how they let that happen, and the software dev in me is just too disgusted right now that they let that kind of revert happen.
---
I'll keep watching and hopefully reinstall in a year or so
---
haha your funny...
---
First example: high level players walk up on low level at base, start destroying base and hit player in pacifist trying to kill through slap damage.
---
*you*: First example isn’t griefing.
---
Second Example: High level player walks up on low level at base, starts destroying base and hit player in pacifist trying to kill player through slap damage.
---
*you*: The second example isn’t griefing
---
You don’t get them from scraping weapons?
---
other containers arent persistent, so theres normaly no need for a database.
---
You are a true Raider.  Kudos
---
Don't worry. I'm confident that BGS has some form of project management and planning.
---
This means BGS Austin, which supposedly supports (and made) fo76, will probably continue to do so. I mean, if the have planned to use them for support, there won't be any other projects in there queue. 
---
If there is no word of a new project or huge lay offs, stopping support is a loss for BGS/Zenimax. While keeping it running at least gives them some gain from the atomshop.
---
Are bobby pins still heavy?
---
Are you sure that you don't have anything stored to your camp?
---
You can still play..start a new character until they fix the issue. 
---
Long story short, Bethesda are aware of this issue and have known for a really long time but for other reasons decided that it more effort than its worth to fix and that message will probably vanish in due course. 
---
Turn off VATS in PvP.
---
Rule number 9 bud.
---
Launching the nuke is actually the fun part. I was level 50 when I did my first silo, took me like hour. Died multiple times, but I never gave up, because that what I like- over coming the challenges.
---
It's rather what comes after launching the nuke, is least fun part, because there really aint any unique rewards from launching it. Yea, SBQ is unique, but 98% of SBQ design if f#cking garbage and I can totally ignore it, by just collecting caps and buying his rewards from players, what makes SBQ irrelevant.
---
...and what happend with "You need to find same minded people to launch Nuke"? Their whole nuke sale points was that it's hard to launch nuke, because you needed to collect keys and then you needed to find people who had keys that you didn't and then you needed to go with those people to launch nukes. Before TSE nerf (I haven't played now, no idea how long it takes) it took around 20 minutes to launch nuke solo, what an joke.
---
...and people were:"You aint gonna launch nuke on Player bases, because nukes are hard to come and nukes zones are so rewarding that only idi#ts would waste their key codes to nuke someones base", and there we were, launching nukes every 20 minutes and most of the times didn't even get really anything rewarding.
---
I disagree.
---
Your characters need to have serious flaws in their SPECIAL. Its an online RPG.
---
Enemies. They’ll open your door and walk in to start destroying stuff. 
---
I couldn’t figure out how scorched kept getting into my first camp, turns out they just open the door... 
---
Go read the rule yourself. Seems you’ve misunderstood it at a very fundamental level. 
---
Fornite hospital
---
Buying and playing their game to stick it to Bethesda huh? That’ll show ‘em
---
“No Witch Hunting” You gave the name of those who did you wrong on here. Sounds like a witch-hunt to me.
---
I did.. the two lines after I said "how did I miss the joke". Was it dickish of me to say whoosh? Yeah maybe, I'll admit that. But I dont think there any argument that it wasnt a whoosh. 
---
Every time you level up you can take new perks, or after level 50, respec points.
---
I didn’t accuse anyone of cheating. Griefing is griefing. It’s not cool. But it’s not cheating. 
---
I recommended logging off if encountering these individuals, not engaging. 
---
Says nothing about naming players. Maybe that should be added if it’s an issue. 
---
Bud. 
---
And get like 2 screws an hour? Sure it's a nice bonus but hardly the solution to a fairly universal screw shortage...
---
[Like eating people?](https://youtu.be/eN0hbQALkag)
---
It’s good man, worth the buy for sure it’s well polished and is a breath of fresh air actually, plus there’s no “premium content or season pass” so everyone gets the dlc for free👍🏼You could probs pick it up for a bit cheaper now too!
---
Bethesda will catch him. 
---
someone is going to get banned soon ... can you idiots stop using glitches?
---
It means every time I drop steel from inventory/stash to the paper bag or other container every part of steel should get their own RefID which should be unique on this server.
---
Yeah for sure man, you make a good point!!!
---
*checks nexus mods*
---
you can play on french language and there is no server restriction.
---
I am european and im grouped with americanos. Eu servers are full of people who dont speak english. There are too many languages, so um, eu servers sux. Join america!
---
Had a pair of guys hit my camp too.  1 was walking around choosing targets to destroy at my camp very slowly.  Another hidden on a cliff.  I'm guessing they expected me to kill the wanted guy so they could kill me.  Blocked them both and relogged.
---
I just noticed half an hour ago, that my favorite (and best) weapon isn't in my inventory anymore. Yesterday I had both of them. I had two weapons with the same name, other 1 star and the other 3 star. Now I have only the 1 star, which I was keeping as a reserve. 
---
Yesterday one of my outfits went missing. Thought that I've accidentally dropped it, but maybe that's not the case.   
---
I lock doors because normal enemies can open unlocked doors. 
---
I agree it’s stupid since there’s no real need to lock doors. The whole CAMP system is broken though, there’s no point in making CAMPs PvP since there’s nothing to steal and there’s no good way to build a cool CAMP and give it proper protection from PvE because the budget usage for defense items is way too high. 
---
Amongst the million other things that are wrong with the game they really need to sort this out. 
---
Do you perhaps have a tamed animal at your camp? 
---
You better get farming then.
---
Go watch any Bethesda documentary these guys have some incredible wotk conditions that people in a cubicle will never receive
---
You guys are lucky!  This needs to be a standard feature......
---
Usually i prefer to do it alone, mobs are weaker etc. 
---
I'm on PC and I lost 30% damage to all weapons until relog once. Another time, I gained 10% by either glitching out on Adrenaline while curing rad worms or the legendary weapon effect +10% damage while aiming.
---
Bulking uses up plastics.
---
9/10 would destroy for being ugly af.
---
Lead and aluminum basically is it that I’ve noticed. 
---
aluminium and lead i heard. Bulking also allows you to sell. plus u lose the plastic in the process, so there is that too
---
I will bulk that thanks
---
I feel your pain man!!!! Its insane, I question wether the developers play as much as most of us... Or if they are on a developer server where these issues are non-existent
---
Aluminum and Lead give about a 50% reduction in weight from bulking because their bulk weights are bugged. All others bulks are similar in weight to the raw materials and not worth wasting plastic on.
---
Did you block them? If you do, they won't see you on the map and they shouldn't be able to see you in their "recent" list anymore
---
You written some names, you are witch hunting. 
---
I heard that bulking aluminium copper cork oil gears springs and lead is worth it to bulk
---
There is nothing real in videogame.there's nothing to be done to your base in fallout.

Stop comparing it to real life and stop being scared like a wet kitty of pvp.

I’m planning to as soon as I get on tomorrow. I was done with the whole situation once I logged off. 
---
Could you send me a link for the PC mod? wanna see if I can port it
---
Stardew Valley: Fallout Edition
---
But with a chance to get new cards. Like spirits in Super Smash Bros Ultimate
---
It’s only a fifth as effective. Only removing 400 rads in to comparison to Radway’s 2000 rads and Diluted Radway’s 1000 rads. 
---
the problem is that ur using tse. Change it for the love of radworms.
---
I had the same problem. I went bloody explosive handmade and I added the superior armor penetration mod instead of drum magazine. Everything melts in a few shots.
---
In regards to full stacked pvp gear, crits ignore all that shit, so stack up a crit on ur dragon and blow him away next time.
---
It might be something I can attach to my character through Bethesda account
---
i would do anything. anything. anything. for PS4 regular graphics to be this good for this game :\*(
---
Mole miners remind me of super soldiers from No One Lives Forever 2 and i feel bad when i kill them ;_;
---
Had the dame problem. Restart game has fixed it for me. Good Luck.
---
I suppose you are doing something wrong ( i mean 5k rounds etc). 
---
Please tell me your platform, show me your build. Do you have any mutations?  Let's see what is wrong.
---
&gt;\&gt;&gt; 20 Radaway, 
---
Problem 1. You nuke the wrong place.
---
I spent $15 in the atom shop. I pay Google for their servers, I can pay Bethesda, and it lets me paint my combat armor. We will know in 24-36 months
---
Totally I don't mess with peeps to grief then I mess to be that odd ball in the world
---
Add it to the rule then. 
---
The motive behind a **strict** law is to leave no room for ambiguity. Gray area is problematic and should be avoided at all costs. 
---
You know, unless our society deteriorates into a........wasteland 😎
---
Jesus why? I have no perks and only keep 4 on me. I get new ones from robobrains if I need them
---
One of the bunkers up north related to main quest is popular to leave schematics in.

As you get decent gear you wont need much junk anymore. I have to throw some of it away over time as my stash gets full.

better inventory (must have too)
---
It's all I have for guns lol. I have been fine with changes so far when in PvE but I don't ever really care for PvP and rarely ever do it. The state of PvP in this game is awful and it needs major balancing. Maybe legendary effects having no effect on PvP would make it more balanced. I know a lot of people would be pissed because they have no lifed to become immortal but if you are in it for the PvP are you really wanting to just melt everything? Wheres the challenge in that?
---
[Yeah until you play on console.](https://youtu.be/eN0hbQALkag)
---
Thank for the tip
---
It wasn't targeted at that single weapon though and as a result impacted a lot of things. Two shot weapons became 1.2 shot weapons, the explosive perk also got the same treatment (damage was reduced to 20% from 100%) while explosives in general got hit hard too which affected the already terrible missile launchers and fatman launchers. Three things that all impacted one weapon type but also caused problems for other things in the game.
---
Bobby pins gained weight massively as an example of one of the old issues that came back. It was not just a case of, "Wahhh my TSE can't one-shot everything" although even those people likely weren't aware of what exactly was done to affect TSE weapons beyond not killing things instantly almost guaranteed.
---
All I do is wander around and literally pick up every single piece of trash I find not glued to the ground. 
---
For a while I had my camp set up on a acid resource but found that to be unnecessary due to me not having ores. So yeee, nobody picks up ores except for you OP :(
---
Some PA mods to make them similar such as a multi-portal helmet or especially the drill as a melee weapon would rock.  The drill could basically use the same mechanics as the ripper plus maybe give some extra ores when collecting.
---
As someone with a far smaller CAMP - how? I have got to be missing a lot of budget somewhere and I hate that I'd have to literally scrap my entire CAMP just to prove it
---
The very definition of fine: this comment
---
I got a good chuckle 
---
Yeah it is stupid, i still don't get why "fag police" guys got banned, that was awesome joke. I am just telling you, that your post is witch hunting and probably will be deleted. People are sensitive these days, better not write anything on internet at all.
---
I know it sucks to get griefed but blocking should solve the issue. Its best not to react to their behavior in any way and move on. Believe me, it's not satisfying for them if their griefing isn't met with a response. Look up "operant conditioning" for more information if you're interested. It usually applies to children but seeing how griefers behave, I have reason to believe that it's what they are. 
---
And please be nice enough to remove their names from your post. Not only is it a witch hunt but they would be validated in their behavior if they see it. 
---
What platform are you playing on?
---
It's in the content that's coming soon™
---
Xbox DreadfulNirvana and DreadfulTurkey we been hunting griefers (let's make fallout 76 great again) lol yes o do help but had to with this economy
---
Yeah, I second this. OP seems to have done nothing that would violate rule 9.
---
We don’t want pvp. We never did. 
---
Nope! Wrote that one down. Thanks!
---
Thanks! Will visit there.
---
Nope, I actually tried today but on my alt I'm not high enough lockpicking. I'll try again soon.
---
That place was awesome, actually visited there on my main during beta. Will be going back though to thoroughly explore.
---
&gt;	decreases disconnects of this nature.
---
&gt;	You can disagree all you want, that’s fine.
---
&gt;	But there is no way you will stay connected to any other online shooter, in an active match, if you stop responding for several seconds
---
Have you tested that? I've pulled and replugged ethernet cables before, that was a decade ago. Lots of progress in netcode  techniques since then.
---
I play as a stealth bloody build.
---
I am one shot in every case, but that is if they no where to shoot that one shot lol.
---
Take my advice, max out rifle perks, plus tank killer, 4 demolition, bloody mess and ur set on cards. Ofcourse mutations help alot.
---
Then buy a bloody explosive handmade 4k market price, hunting rifle 8k+ depending on the sellers greediness, it could go upto 15k. or the lever action rifle, which could 1 shot also.
---
U could do the same with shotguns, but rifles get anti armor mods, and has better range.
---
The thing about melting and 1 shotting... if u can't, ur opponent could. So no pointing in trying to work around it.  It's like the wild west, first one to shoot wins lol. 
---
My idea for a PvP mode I think you would like.. No legendary at all. Only base items. All the armor and weapon plans need to be used somewhere. Why not in something like this? I'd play it. Current formats not so much. 
---
 When you join this mode either your current load out is saved in you stash as a freebee stashed item zero weight. And when u go back to adventure the kits swap. The PvP one is now in the zero weight hold... Or.... All legendary perks are removed. I think perk choices would then be more important. Give us a good reason to go and grind out caps to buy all the plans for weapons and mods etc. 
---
they smell fear... or annoyance...
---
regardless even at level 70 with max stealth, I've had scorchbeast follow me for miles
---
Are we really at the point where the game has been ruined so badly that just to be actual play the game and not be destroyed you need to do a low HP build? That's so lame.
---
Yeah, I'd rather keep them but just hide them somehow. Or better yet, a way to star/favorite the ones that you most use.
---
Animated ones??
---
The only ores worth your acid is Lead Ore. Escavation PA gives you 4x ores instead of one. You can farm about 50 in one go at Lucky Mole Mine. No reason to waste your acid on anything else, workshops are pretty much dead since Bethesda nerfed them.
---
i am a chameleon build. Getting hits is never a problem when you don't take hits to begin with lol
---
I dont use unyielding or any of that shit.

In regards to gaming mechanics and builds... don't act like u never heard of a glass cannon. Very common in games buddy. It isn't lame and it's acceptable in many games. I can't see why its a problem now.
---
My character's shop provides weapon modding, armor crafting, AND Camp building and renovations.
---
You just have to know where to look. :)
---
I just tried mine and it did the same thing.
---
I'm just saying there needs to be some major balancing of legendary effects to make it more balanced so you can have hundreds of builds that are all equally as effective in their own way.
---
I'm talking about extras to perk lines allready maxed out... I have first aid at rk 3 but also one at rk 1. Same with 5-6 other in every perk tree... 
---
And i'm not even super high level.. it's a hazzle i tell ya .. a hazzle 😎
---
That was very enjoyable to read
---
I've found multiple red and brown ones at Defiance.
---
My base is open plan with nothing locked down, I kinda feel like it's in the spirit of the game to have communal spaces for others to craft and rest etc. (I like to think of myself as Responder) but in all seriousness I collect so much junk and with the stash limit being what it is, having to repair or rebuild the camp seems like a good way to utilise those gathered materials. 
---
Animated cards is the opposite og what I like in the game.. I want to spend less time looking at them - not more 😛
---
They make me sad a bit too. I do tend to feel bad killing them, even though it is likely a mercy that we do. 
---
But needs must, I need that black titanium and I need to get past them to get to my objective. And when I've got a whole bunch of them ganging up on me brandishing their gauntlets, then I gotta do what I gotta do.
---
Im sad that they carry toys so often. 
---
Probably has several characters
---
And that sir is your opinion. I prefer other aspects to the game other than forced pvp.  If I wanted pvp I would have bought battlefield or call of duty. I bought it hoping to get some of the other fallout feel with real players involved. 
---
I raised a ticket too. I know I lost that precious knife for good, but well, at least it is now reported "officially".
---
I enjoy killing them the most. Little feckers you call "poor" are the same feckers that shoot rockets at me
---
Heh, bought it for other reasons obviously (loved Skyrim and FO4, wanted more), but it’s a bit late for a return. May as well do have as much fun as I can while doing as much harm as possible within permitted game mechanics. Revisiting KC:D most gaming hours this week, tho.
---
Those two are pretty simple since you can get 100+ of them after almost every queen fight.  Head west from the queen when you are done, most of the plant's that way give Violet, Cobalt, and Fluorescent flux.
---
Two kinds of people
---
true, there are 2 meta builds at the moment, melee and snipe/vats. That doesn't mean the others aren't there. They just ain't as strong as these ones.
---
The thing is, twoshot now is more of a burden then help. It splits ur dps into two inaccurate shots and explosives are easily negated with dense and fireproof. 
---
An antiarmor explosive handmade is bettee than ts.
---
Every thing is better than TS at this point, while it is still gr8 in pve, it has poor damage output on bullet sponges and sux in pvp.
---
I seen that and if bethesda would have put a little more effort in the build mechanics the glitching the floor wouldn't be necessary. They kind of limited the true potential of the build aspect. 
---
Can foundations not be destroyed by other players?
---
What the above fellow said. And never log out at whitesprings like ever. I have the most trouble with this nonsense there. I put my camp away from everything. Fav spot is now that lumber yard south of the vault I log in and chill. Wait to hear the lumberjack protectron start to buzz around talkin about his job then it's good to go. Don't open pip boy, Jump, move, or nothing just wait for the lil Paul bunyon bot to start talking. He is usually the last bit to load in.
---
Ah, the good ol'...  F-future-- Past--
---
Uhh oh screw it.
---
Ah the good ol' days, killing legion slavers and double agenting between the ncr and bos.  Oh how I miss those days...
---
Bioshock is 1930’s [Art Deco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Deco), while Fallout is 1950s [Googie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googie_architecture)
---
It's easy to counter these op builds if you know how.
---
Sentinel builds requires the person to stay still, if you can stagger them this negates their armor effect. The tank killer perk is exelent for this, not only does it have a chance to stagger an opponent but it ignores 36% armor when maxed
---
Couple this with armor penetration mods and anti armor legendary and your pretty much ignoring all their armor
---
Bloody builds require your opponent to keep under 25% health to max their damage potential, they do this by increasing their radiation so their health stays at 25%. Any gun/grenade that deals radiation damage will be effective in taking them down
---
Gamma gun being the most effective, give it a deep dish and it deals 125 radiation per shot, if you can find a executioners gamma gun it deals 50% more damage to enemies who's health is below 40%
---
They never took XIV offline though. It was up until ARR then the new servers were brought online after many months of rigorous work by the Square dev team, even while their families were apart because of a major tsunami that hit Japan. I just can't see Bethesda pulling the crazy kinda work that Square did.
---
And toilet paper. 
---
If u can, also just open map and ft the hell away from the resort. Lol it will prob lock your controlls unable to move once u get to Wherever u travel to But if u get away from there u should be on your way to getting your game back. 
---
Crazy that i will have to fast travel away from where i want to be because the game cant cope. Surely with the massively lower than expected playerbase, the servers could handle people signing in?!
---
Thanks, will try this
---
ur welcome 
---
After turning into melee I don't need them as much anymore. Yet I loot any when I see and stash'em after scraps out of habit. I put them in containers as 200-300 amounts near stations recently. I hope someone in need see them later. 
---
*Finally* somebody has mentioned that they actually say things! "Ugh... my God."
---
Made me think of Z Nation.
---
"I give you mercy."
---
I loved it lol! 
---
Foundations, Stairs and upper floors are invincible.
---
I mean, if you were stuck in your mining suit for 25 years you’d be wheezing and grunting too.
---
I’m with Cookie Monster. Every time I stumble over that way it’s 60+. Even with no one there. I didn’t know if I needed to be a certain level or what the deal was. 
---
I’m bored with the main story so I wandered over that way and got destroyed a few times 
---
Did you ever tame an animal and bring it back to your camp? Apparently there's an issue where doing so consumes a big chunk of your CAMP's budget, and even after the animal dies, that budget is still taken up. Bethesda has said that they're aware of the issue and are working on it. 
---
I thought that was the whole thing. Isn't the chest piece just the outfit? 
---
Idk... Reading this made my head hurt. Not insulting you I'm just and idiot or tired. (All honesty prob both) But I think max dmg for bloodied weapons stops going up when your life gets around 20%?
---
Ever since the last update it’s been doing that I had it on before the patch started and when I logged in after the servers came up my armor was showing
---
The Hats don't share spawn points with the uniforms.
---
He's just saying to be aware of them and to be wary of their obnoxious behaviour. There's no call, implicit or otherwise, to act against them, just to be alert to the threat they pose. 
---
But- but- I've been to Wendigo Cave, I saw what happened to that cannibal after he ate Edie.  I'll take some radiated disease riddled fruit over that kinda food any day!
---
Coppers a must to
---
Thank you for your response, so maybe just for everybody I guess, i would like it to be fixed.
---
Was this PC? PS4? XBox? 
---
Ya same I had to find a new outfit to use.
---
We locked you up how did you get out... have some Psycho Mama 
---
But seriously madam, hugs cos we made it
---
I never have any acid either man ;) haha just kidding. I think soap has it and I constantly melt ores as well. Acid is one of the things I have to buy in bulk quite often. 
---
I run around with grognaks and the axe roleplaying
---
I always throw out copper. I only keep 50-100 of it. What do you need it for?
---
Intended for OP sorry!
---
Trying to work out wtf you have to do. Only to have the quest bug out and you have to start from the beginning of the dungeon again haha
---
Electrical for base building when you change your base every other day it gets expensive in copper since when you break down electrical it won’t return copper
---
Even with speed demon I don't mind water consumption at all. I was using an alchol build and it was even more brainless (1 beer per 10 minute to top the bar) I still sell like 50 purified waters every day. Sure, since patch it's far more faster, radworms with speed demon could be the culprit but even unmutated people are affected. Still it's the last problem I'd list. 
---
Sick!😂
---
That's what I like to hear, good to hear someone enjoying it. Perhaps when you reach those higher levels you can help this level 9 out? I haven't had much playtime just yet, but planning on putting some hours in soon. Good luck and hopefully see you out there.
---
It’s the only reason I made a melee build
---
Idk what caused it. Patch or two ago we got an extra loading screen and this little gem. As if game says enjoy this nice picture you took while I still finish loading.....er wait 🤔. It's bizzare. 
---
I guessed they didn't know how to fix when their 'hotfix' was to fix less than 10 issues that got re-introduced by a 'failed automerge'
---
If they can't just do a re-merge with the correct files, then people were probably not telling the truth when they blamed the automerge.
---
Liam Neeson?
---
Go head and buy it, it's honestly pretty fun. No restrictions on server. 
---
Ah. Tks for the info. I never change my base so i guess that's why i didn't require it.
---
You bastard!
---
Looks like the mob is unable to reach you so it heals because it thinks you are exploiting pathing.
---
The saw type weapons (chainsaw, ripper, Mr. Handy, drill) all do insane amounts of damage very quickly so the slap damage ramps up really quick, especially if they are strength stacking.  Just be glad he wasn't using Overly Generous with one of them, that's when it gets particularly brutal.  Good on you for capping him though!
---
White springs has always been a hot mess for me. Most crashes and such happen there for me. It's a true gamble making a nuke zone there wether I will be able to participate or not.
---
Yeah everything else is easy to get and returns well when you break down base items but anything that uses copper won’t return any at all and for you to get a set of electric pipes to anouther side of your base it starts adding up
---
To me this takes away from the experience: i enjoy discovering what’s out there without preconceptions of what’s possible. 
---
Researching all of the weapons and perks and locations and armor types ahead of time feels more like study than play— I enjoy shifting my build with changing conditions and as I learn new places and enemies and mechanics. A predefined goal for the “perfect” build seems antithetical to the survival aspects of the game. And it makes the level-50 respec more interesting because it takes time to adjust as I decide to adapt.
---
Wouldn't 76 give us some Specials over 10?  70 points alone grants a more than full special.
---
I get the idea with the theme of the number 76, hell Clara's notes I found in Fort Defiance have 76 entries, and as much as I would like my special stats maxed like that one time in FO4 when I actually played with mods, I can appreciate the limited special for perk card limitation purposes.
---
I just wish they'd let me pay 500 or 1k caps to re-select my entire perk card list and special points.  Or at least give us a vendor who will buy duplicate perks off of you for caps or allow you to swap them with other perks from the whole list.
---
Armor is not supposed to show up when wearing an outfit, and that's what's happening.
---
Thanks, just going to trade them to my main character via a friend
---
never had a TSE. never had an issue with them either.
---
I was pissed off because within 5 minutes of loading I was having issues with bugs that had just been fixed. within 10 I was stuck in power armour unable to get out, with my last core at 55%
---
within 20 I was quitting after having to logout and back in to get around without being in PA due to the fusion core generators only working at .8 per hour again.
---
Only upside, I have calibrated shocks plan for excavator armour.
---
No flux to make. but the plan.
---
Dynamic dungeons and this game will be more addictive than cocaine
---
Aluminum scrap tho
---
I hunt them to farm Shotgun and Combat Rifle ammo. Maybe it's sad, but ammo its ammo.
---
So, there is actually some lore behind Moleminers that I have missed on my 200+ play time ;D
---
I am sloth.
---
Dang man, you had to go there :(
---
One called me by name during a quest. My party members i was with thought it was weird it would say jackie good luck but then i told them that was my characters name. 
---
Are you sure? Theres no tables, in the op and the bed is reversed, and the light fixtures? Dont match
---
&gt; Take the game offline. 
---
Why?  How does that help?  The game is playable as is (I'm playing it).  How does taking it offline increase the rate of fixes?
---
Ghoul Slayers...  Gamma Gun...  Really...  Oh hey ima shot this thing that heals from radiation, WITH RADIATION.  What could go wrong??
---
What weapon do you use?
---
One of my chars uses bloodied, but only against high pool enemies in pve such as the scorched queen or sometimes the mirelurk queen, but this last one's acid saliva literally melts my char everytime!
---
I use a bloodied gauss rifle, my build is focused on crit with rifles, basically a glass cannon, my END is 4, i use only the +3 INT&amp;PER at night and acquagirl, i have nerd rage on int, i dont use serendipity, I use every luck point on crit based perks. My AGI is 15 though for stealth perk, stealth damage perks, adrenaline, etc. Basically shotting pretty much everything except for high hp enemies, like scorched queen, again.
---
Buy I think the one that benefits more from bloodied are melees, with the +3 special if low hp gears, as melees damage zcale woth str too. Range weapons still benefit from agi for spav, lck for spav crit meter and per for spav hit rate and so on.
---
&gt; i can't help but think there's much more than a skeleton crew working on it now as progrmmers, artists and etc get reshuffled on to other projects.
---
As far as I know Bethesda Austin are working on this game 100%.  They have no other projects.
---
To me the appeal of the Fallout franchise has always been a distinct discrepancy between pre-war and post-war in terms of technology, social structures, politics, economy, etc...
---
In this setting, there are certain things which simply can no longer be produced due to the lack of knowledge, infrastructure or raw materials. There are no more supermarkets and factories, no more global production chains and no real economy. People pre-war used to be consumers (passive), now they have to be scavengers (active). This contrast is what makes the world of Fallout so interesting... because it reflects our own society. Most of the stuff we ourselves use on a daily basis are taken for granted and the vast majority of us have no clue whatsoever how our stuff actually works - let alone how to fix it. We don't even know where basic items like our food or clothing come from and we lack the knowledge how to manufacture ANYTHING.
---
Items like Fusion Cores should be treated by the game as rare and priceless artifacts from a time long since gone. My suggestion would be to greatly increase their capacity and greatly decrease their availability. And when they're gone, they'r gone. They should neither be rechargable nor craftable.
---
One could argue that the residents of Vault76 have been selected specifically because they are the best of the best of the best - so they might perhaps know how to do all these things... but in the overall context of the franchise I still think that the whole crafting thing is starting to get slightly out of hand...
---
You're absolutely being a dick.  They are keeping NPC enemies from freely entering through the door.
---
Everything has a cost, in this case inventory cost, so yes weight, but just saying weight is inaccurate because not everyone has the same carrying ability, so that weight means more to them than someone who can carry 460 lbs. Thus I say inventory cost.

I've found many things in them on PS4. My team (about 10 of us all over 100) always drop items at the train stations, overseers camp and flatwoods..
---
What they said, over half of homeless people (In the US anyway) have a job, they're not lazy, they're just screwed over.  We shouldn't discriminate against the less fortunate, we can be better, we can make a better economy where everyone thrives!
---
DOWN WITH THE-- BLEGH
---
-sniper pulls away from scope- "oy sielly chommunhist.'
---
THROUGH THE COLD MIST
---
South of watoga station comes to mind
---
I couldn’t agree more. They did it for weapons with mods, why not for power armor?
---
I mean, even considering this it's still risk free because you can just run back in and get to where you died. The only "risk" is the inconvenience of having to load back in.
---
I can't believe this post actually worked! Thanks for the invite! I thought of that too when I got your attention, I have a mic just most opportunities I can't actually use it so I'm happy emotes are enough till they add text chat
---
Yeah, I was just making a joke.  I got instant downvoted and multiple comments within less than a minute of posting from people that obviously didn't read it.  I don't think I'm going to post here anymore.
---
You fast travel to workshops for free, so taking hemlock Holmes should be your only expense to getting those 3 extractors going.  
---
I literally drop excess stuff at vendor locations specifically for this reason.  If I'm gonna trash these things at least I'll give someone else a chance to grab them.
---
And don't get me started on ammo.  I dropped 20 missiles and 5 mini nukes once cause I discovered their weapons were total junk, I just hope someone else found them and used them.  An explosive ordinance's worse nightmare is never getting to go off before they meet the big bomb maker in the sky.
---
Add in gears and springs. I'm always short of gears and springs, I've swimming in screws. 
---
That, sir, wasn't a griefer, just a morally ambiguous, yet in the end, decent person.
---
Especially blue suitcase near stash box at Whitesprings
---
If you really think about it though, it’s a mercy killing. They’ve gone mental, trapped in their suits for the past quarter century, they’ve lost all sanity, they’re begging to be put down.
---
I thought the pvp scaling put high level players at a *noticeable* disadvantage?
---
its a % of ur health. Ur max hp doesnt really matter.
---
At least your first thoughts weren't about Grif from Red vs Blue.
---
u solved ur own problem in the description lol.
---
I think your games buggy  i get 198 lead or when i go to lucky hole mine
---
"I pardon you."
---
1. Griefing is literally part of the game, there is even a perk for it!
---
2. Witchunting is against the rules
---
I almost got lucky and had an Enclave space coffin hit a living Scorched but I had to kill it. Instead it almost sent its body ragdolling into space, it was glorious. 
---
Fusion core price is less than violet flux at any known market.
---
B
---
Yeah i think i went without Escavator and forgot the actual number.
---
Radworms boosted my lockpicking skill to 4 last night.  I love radworms, freed up a perception card slot!!
---
Hello noob here, what is 'Escavation PA'?
---
Todd is that you?
---
/j
---
It’s quite the contrary.... It’s the most realistic thing in the game.  Have you ever been to the WV DMV?  They absolutely nailed it.   That said, I’d venture to guess there are many outside of WV that have painful DMV experiences as well.  
---
Sheeeeeeit!
---
I had three of them spawn inside a concrete wall in my base. I was convinced I had a mole rat problem. The sound they make? I don't recall radrats well enough from Nuka-World, but did they use the same audio file for both? With that horrific laboured breathing? 
---
Escavation Power Armor. You can craft it after finishing a quest. It gives you +100 more carry weight and the arms from that power armor gather 4x more Ores while wearing them.
---
Oh wow. I actually have that quest, just need to get level 25 to do it.
---
Lol what, is this replicate-able or fallout 76 being fallout 76?
---
A Suppleyebot.
---
That’s what I think we should all test.  Before it happened I saw some kind of green swirling Effect, but it could have been the diseased behemoth loading in on me.  
---
For reference, I was at the Church in Clarksburg, and I went to the altar, where the dead body is.
---
No kids from the vault either. Overseer even mentions that the residents of Vault 76 had kids and made families. Must have put birth control in the water for the last 18 years. 
---
The game balance is so broken. I don't care about PvP. I have no faith Bethesda can fix it. But I get so aggravated when I'm still getting one shot in passive mode.
---
seen post, max hps = 600.  another post said that damage reduction add 1% per 7rezistance (x-01 pa have over 400DR = 57% damage reduction without any penetration). But there is Sentinel/cavalier legendary effect which gives you +15% damage reduction which stack per piece and for pvp there is legendary effect Assasins which gives another +8% reduction.   If you get 5x Assasin-sentinel armor pieces, you become very hard to kill. (when you are staggered this protection dont apply, so melee will still wreck you)
---
Why?  You should criticise the parts of the game that don't work whether or not anyone apologizes, just like you should praise the parts that do work.
---
Age human meat, mmhmmm...
---
I built mine on a crossroads and put a campfire with some chairs around it. I also have all the benches open for use and some beds. I like when other players stop by.
---
Aside from one or two types, I never pick up ore anymore.
---
I don't think this community gets sarcasm.
---
Why would anyone NOT want other players using work benches, stash boxes etc.?   There’s nothing they can steal and if they want to destroy it, they will whether it’s locked or not.   
---
As to mobs attacking things, I have my camp in a high traffic area and mobs attack it all the time.  I put a few turrets out and they handle it just fine.   The only time my camp is damaged and in need of repair is when someone runs back to it with a bunch of mobs in tow or a scorchbeast.    The regular mobs that attack it (even high levels) don’t do much of anything by the time the turrets kill them.  
---
All that said, I suppose it’s ultimately up to the individual player to decide.   If you choose to place it in a high traffic area and lock it up, I think you can reasonably assume it will be damaged by other players.  
---
Sarcasm, learn to identify it.
---
Deathclaw steak. 
---
That sir, is called sarcasm.
---
Im level 440. I didnt touch any of the exploits. Played for 800 hours on one character. Roughly 10+ hours a day since launch. Totally solo play, abused the fuck out of whitesprings nukes in the first few months to power level.
---
If i see people drastically higher level than me I am 100% certain they cheated to get there. At level 700 I guarantee they abused the early exploits.
---
I imagine that Mirelurk meat could be alright, like crab or lobster maybe.
---
I don't have the outfit but I swear there was another issue regarding it a few patches ago. Gotta love that subsequent versions can break your purchases...
---
Then again, I bought the slicked oil paint for the metal armour. Guess what? The Heavy Metal Left arm isn't overridden by the Pipboy in first person. I would've noticed it sooner but I use the transparent Pipboy. It's kinda a big deal though, it clips through the Pipboy and obscures 70% of the screen. 
---
So yeah, if they're selling broken things I suppose them breaking store content in patches isn't unbelievable.
---
[Human.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN0hbQALkag) It's not legal tho.
---
This.
---
Fallout has been the iconic 'see bad but not be on the receiving end' video game for me, when raiders appear I'm ready to fight because lore wise I should, gameplay wise it's fun, and realistically as the protagonist of the game story, I will inevitably be felled with stumbling across horrendous things, but I'll never be one of those things victims (unless I really screw up).  I'll see skeletons of deathclaw victims, but never be one of those victims, I'll see the chained and hanging raider victim corpses, but never be one of them.
---
In this game the lore says other players are my fellow vault dwellers out to explore and rebuild Appalachia, raiders were rich ass holes and other greedy survivors whom resorted to violence as a means of survival.  The gameplay gives me several mechanics to deter griefing.
---
The end result, griefers are literally lore breaking, intended gameplay ignoring people.   We NEVER wanted nonconsensual pvp, we understand the idea and fun behind pvp but Fallout is not borderlands, rust, ark, cod, or any of that.  If I want to fight a player we should both have to agree to it, send me a pvp invite through the social menu, if I agree I'll get marked on your map and compass as if I'm wanted, and the usual crouch to disappear mechanic can still work, but if I disagree, you shouldn't be able to damage me beyond a fraction of my health (like 1/5th)
---
I've played Minecraft and 7 Days to Die.  I've died and lost everything, what's more I've even gotten lost on Minecraft for PC and lost my home.  You know why I don't play those games anymore?  When I die and lose all my stuff, literally hundreds of hours of exploring worth of stuff, I quit and don't pick it back up, because that's an *extreme* waste of my time that I will *never make the mistake of doing again* on that game.
---
If the same could happen on Fallout, which, it can't, you'd probably see this game being much less popular.  The worst we ever had to deal with was dying after hours of not saving and even then autosaves did their best to alleviate that.
---
To be out exploring with 50lbs of junk on you, good junk that you've accumulated over the last few hours, only to lose it all because your fellow vault dweller went psychopath and somehow one shot killed you, is more than ridiculous, it's literally madness.
---
Acid and Steel!
---
I imagine they are contaminated through having contact with diseased creatures. Maybe bring a flamethrower to sterilize them? 
---
Ah. Gotcha. Yup that's a load of bs especially if someone spent the cash on it. 
---
Sounds like someone that has never been to a real DMV.  ThAt is EXACTLY how it feels.  It’s the most accurate part of the entire game. 
---
Since I eat a lot of it in game, I'll go for grilled radstag.
---
Same here at lvl 21. Had one follow me around. I sneaked through the woods and made it back to camp. Closed the windows and started crafting and went to bed. Got "well rested", went outside to take a peek thinking the SB got bored. Nope. He called in reinforcements in the form of two other SBs. Ass hole.
---
Had another in the Bog. Was doing the Watoga quest to make the robots friendly. I'm hoofing it down that main road to get the hacker's evidence and see one circling up ahead. I never took one on, so I decided to take pot shots at him with a speced hunting rifle from cover just outside his patrol area and just inside the range for my weapon. Hit him (love the "thud" sound when your shot connects at long range). Screen went to caution and back to hidden in 30 seconds. 
---
With the shitty damage the .308 did, I didn't want to waste ammo. So I came out of cover, shot him in the ass to get his attention,  then hauled ass towards three high level players that were near. I thought they would fight this flying gas bag, but they must have been paying attention. They fast traveled out before I could get to them.
---
I learned my lesson, stowed my weapon, took off all my armor &amp; clothing,  and took my punishment in the form of being  microwaved by that damn thing. At least I didn't have any junk to loose.
---
Heart Emoji and 5 healing salves dropped for every camp with their builder present.  I'm just a responder nurse in need of a workbench and your portal box to my stash.  If you don't kill me you'll get 100% health from me!
---
I may have to make the journey up their then

Keep in mind you can apply a mod called Callibrated Shocks to any power armour leg pieces. Gives 50 carry weight. I believe it's a mod for Excavator too so you could get 200 carry capacity, but don't feel like you need to stick to it. I'm certain you'll get tired of the aesthetic of the Excavator sooner or later. Isn't helped by the fact that the power armour paints completely exclude it. 
---
You would die day 1 in ark or Conan if you think the food and water part is to hard in this game 
---
Nope, or springs. The Scrapper perk at the moment is simply not worth it.
---
Dang that username would've checked out if only you liked pussies more.
---
Animals are our friends.  They may even be our best friends.
---
Got it, thank you!
---
The Enclave is overdue for its destruction with extreme prejudice and/or explosives, the really big kind.
---
Yeah, I remember high school creative writing class too.
---
As an aside , even though it's fiction it's kinda not cool to impersonate a vet. 
---
An entire box of insta mash with no water in sight. 
---
Ahhh it'll get destroyed one day, better off having it inside or even better, stored away, if you're worried about it being destroyed.
---
Legitimately why I lock all my shutters...
---
yeah I started doing this, gives me a warm fuzzy feeling knowing I'm helping out a fellow wastelander.
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
Wow so edgy...
---
I recycle tin can traps into 5.56mm. Mining seems like such a hassle by comparison, but I do live very close to 9 can traps.
---
No idea where I get my acid honestly, but I'm never short on it. Is the bulk bug still in effect? 10 acid for 15 when bulked? 
---
I desperately want a fog crawler 😒  I'd name it Mindy. 
---
Was thinking console commands at first but just read your comments. Would love for this to happen to me. 
---
Does that mean I can eliminate them with extreme prejudice and/or high explosives without feeling bad?
---
I am slow. Sloth, I am Sloth. Too.
---
Yo, its 2019. Get a discord server. They're free. 
---
I hope it’s a %chance Spawn so we can duplicate it.  Would make Clarksburg a great farming spot / potentially a great nuke zone
---
The great screw drought of 2102. 
---
That doesn't sound too bad either!
---
Actually its all players that bethesda should want oppinions from.  There is never a way to make everyone happy and ignoring "casual" players because they play less or ignoring power players because they "have it all" is wrong.  With the current system casual players still have the ability to be nearly as effective as power players.  As a player over level 200, its nice to know that level 50 players have the potential to still be really good despite playing less.
---
Take your time and the game will be far more enjoyable. The Try-Hards and Ebayers broke their own game and now they have nothing left to do but complain.
---
Yes. Ad Victoriam, Brother
---
If they have no available target, they will actually stalk you until they seemingly "bump into you". Think it's a lazy mechanic added in to kind of force the scorchbeast threat onto us.
---
Seen some people state that they will also spawn with a random chance when you fast travel, and hunt you down similar to dragons in skyrim.
---
I can't actually confirm this, but those experiences definitely correlate eerily with mine. Before i was able to utilize escape artist and sneak, i didn't have much of a counter to that besides running, popping stims, and hoping another mob grab the beast's attention long enough for me to exit its immediate aggro range.
---
Successful quest reward
---
Fast travel out
---
YAAAAAAY, AD VICTORIAM TIME!
---
I missed there was a DC up there.  
---
I was tempted to but this just to fire mini nukes at it. Pretty disappointed it isn't functional, makes my idea seem reasonable. 
---
&gt; Scout Armor which is ultimately beat by BoS Combat Armor 
---
Except in weight.
---
Wow, somebody used that perk?
---
Specials go to 15
---
I didn't even knew you could actually get those pies! Now i'm crazy over one
---
And legendary armor
---
Yup sentinel assasin is top notch at the moment. Also outside of melee I pack a gamma gun with all the attachments and some nuka grenades for this specific purpose now. I personally don't use that load out because their are alot of counters for it. Stupid high damage output is still an option with a full set of the armor that adds +3 to all special except end while running a bloodied build. 
---
I just don't want my junk extractor being stolen from is all.  Not only is it locked, it's literally the center of my base, surrounded by foundation and walls.  My base is also still accessible in the sense that you can access the interior by jumping to it from the nearby low hanging cliff, access the first floor with extractor, farm plants, and workbenches, then exit by going up the stairs and walking off the second floor.  That second floor however has my bed and stash inaccessible completely without breaking or picklocking something.
---
It's a setup that rewards people willing to explore and not just run around looking for a door.
---
That’s humansplaining. They wanna live otherwise they wouldn’t fight back.
---
I'm filthy screw rich on multiple characters. I think between my two primary characters (no mules) I have 1,500. You get to a point where you find tons. Same with gears and springs, those I just bulk and sell. Acid is the thing I regularly run out of.
---
I don’t carry them. I eat to full and just hop back to CAMP if necessary. Usually enemies drop dog food so I just top off while exploring. 
---
I don’t have to deal with diseases or fewer AP. 
---
Very well said.  This is why the specials max at giving 50 points.  It may be anoying but it means each of my characters are, S.P.E.C.I.A.L.
---
My OCD would never allow all the gaps, but it's cool, though physically impossible. Like some shit out of Dune. 
---
We had something awesome like this near where I live, the Dever mental hospital. They tore it down two years ago, but most Fridays in my teens I was in those buildings smoking with ghosts lol
---
Yup. 
---
I could almost get behind something like this
---
Weight ultimately isn't much of a tradeoff if you get the Strength perk that reduces armor weight by 50 and then 90 percent. 
---
That is damn cool. It's the sort of thing that makes me think about getting back into the game.
---
I wouldn't say it's worthless, having one level of it so you can craft some better armor it's fine but I get that there is no reason to have level 3 of it.
---
Didn't 11 require a bobble head?
---
I am more than willing to help you do some quests and get started on the process of launching a nuke (theirs alot of side stuff to do before the actual launch so we could do that to get you where you need to be when you finally want to) next time I'm on if you want. I can get you set up with a decent start up gun, armor, etc. There's alot to see out their so like everyone says, take your time and enjoy the game. 
---
I totally agree. Most people seem to be missing the sentiment of the post that launching a nuke is a tedious grind fest. 
---
I launched my first nuke solo the other day at around level 65 with full modded X-01 PA. It took most of my ammo, most of my stimpacks, and my weapons broke multiple times. By the time I had gotten to the end I was completely drained. Not because it was a complex system to figure out, or because it was an interesting puzzle.
---
No, I was drained because the whole thing was just wave after wave of robots. Replacing the cores, protecting the launch crew, getting your ID, repairing the generator? It’s just tedium, doing the same actions over and over, with wave after wave of robots and turrets. It’s not fun solo and I can’t imagine it being much more fun as a group. 
---
The worst part of it all is as soon as I got into the nuke zone in Whitesprings my game disconnected. I went through all of that for absolutely nothing. I put the game down and didn’t play for a couple days after that. 
---
Ralph fiennes character 
---
That whole scene was awkward 
---
Nope they just despawn after a few minutes. Sell them on r/fo76bazaar. 
---
I didn't know that was still a thing.  Haven't seen a core in a generator since two patches ago when it was toned down.  These days I ignore the partial cores or toss the cores/frames at flatwoods.
---
I'm apt to pop in and Amite the battle bot for giggles.  Sadly I'm not the only one, two of last three times it was dead and quest got ignored.  &gt;. &lt;
---
You don't technically need them, you just get them cause you want all that extra space 
---
You need to give us more information. 
---
Are you a playing on pc. If so you might have a corrupted file(s) from a bad download
---
Open the Bethesda.net Launcher and click on the game icon to select the game you want to repair. 
---
Click on Game Options on the top right of the Bethesda.net launcher
---
Select Scan and Repair and the launcher will immediately start scanning the game files to validate them
---
Definetly. I nuked their once but I was dcd due to what is most likely dupers after launching a nuke near their. The only reason I say dupers is because everyone in the lobby was kicked. 
---
Cool, that and pain train were the reasons folks used to give for the huge enclave firefights.  Guess it was just folks spreading FUD about a mutation.
---
How long is it open for?
---
I enjoy the plague walker and speed demon mutations, and my build doesn't use vats. Halloween candy is weightless and easy to farm, and dirty water is literally everywhere, just pick it up. The starving debuff is very easy to ignore. 
---
You may be right as I def remember getting initiate paint
---
They break so many shotguns though....
---
Whenever I'm online, at work now but I'll be playing tonight
---
Gamma gun could also be an effective counter to bloody builds too.
---
They keep their low health (25%) by increasing  their radiation to high levels.
---
A level 45 deep dish gamma deals 125 rad damage, if you get an executioner gamma it deals 50% extra damage to opponents with 40% or lower health
---
Can you guys please explain to me why the game wants to charge me 40 caps to move my CAMP only a couple of metres? 
---
Cause no one understands melee is 95% no matter what
---
If you use slightly damp firewood, it's like a cheaper *smoked* longpip.
---
So the only person here not a brat is me, You don't think it's hilarious that I'm not blaming the state of the game on fans.  And I've strengthened my grip on reality.  
---
I'm totally okay with all of that, and I appreciate the compliment.  Cheers mate.
---
Well as the url suggests, it's more of a notice board than a chat. So leave a message for each other rather than having a conversation. I think the forum suits that purpose better.
---
I run a Bloodied build with Dodgy so missing AP are felt. But yours sounds good too. 
---
I’ve got a tattered mole outfit if you want it. What system do you play? 
---
Yikes!!
---
I think that they are releasing fixes only when they release atom shop updates. Read into that what you will.
---
If somebody else has already stated this, forgive me for the accidental plagiarism.

So suddenly all my turrets at my C.A.M.P are gone but they are using up my budget. They aren’t anywhere. I done everything I could to get them to re-appear, even logging off of the game. The wires are still attached but they just are in mid air. This stinks because if I were to move my camp as it’s very packed and has a two story home, chem shop, and tons of furniture and resources like crops and water collectors, it’s just going to happen again and that’s going to be annoying to reset up. The turrets in question are the Missile and Spotlight (wall-mounted) turret  variations, both above ground level.
---
You troll your friends with it
---
Great. Hopefully it'll spawn when I look. Other wise I'll be there for ages 
---
I too played star wars galaxies (this is what we did, vendors with items for 9999999c)
---
Check out the reviews on Youtube :)
---
Hell to the nah nah nah. Save your money and buy Anthem
---
I am kinda getting aggravated that even in pacifist mode that pvp players can do large amounts of damage or even kill me.
---
Not many people seem to actually explore Whisperings. Very few people actually have gone through all the floors to find the nothingness in the resort. The treasure is Bubbles. Gotta get my Grape Soda fix!
---
Yeah but even then there is still problems I was in a team killing the sbq and she was low health, I got disconnected and joined back in just after she died and wasn't able to get any of the loot. They need to implement some way of keeping track of your progress for a short time even if you get disconnected so when you join back you don't loose everything you worked for. What a waste of 1000 .50.
---
Oh man, last week I accidentally ran into a Scorchbeast and got killed, so I spawned back at my C.A.M.P. and *the damn thing followed me there,* and I died at least five more times and got blood all over my floors before the combined effort of me and the Gents, my six Machine Gun Turrets, brought it down.
---
And what did I get for this valiant effort? A bunch of Scorchbeast parts and a Marksman's Plasma Rifle. For my melee/shotgun character. Screw Scorchbeasts.
---
Holy fuck what a drop
---
I was happily married but then Todd seduced my wife, utterly cuckolding me :(
---
Bethesda, I URGE YOU TO MAKE SCREWS, SPRINGS, AND GEARS FALL FROM THE SKY! MEET MY DEMANDS!

Holy fuck what a drop I’m going to check that out 
---
“Tons of content”
---
You mean grinding and more grinding oh and grinding? Don’t forget farming.
---
Yup I hope they stick to their guns.. I'm having alot of fun playing 
---
I didn't even know this bug existed, but it definitly happend yesterday while fighting one of those stupid scorchbeasts.
---
Don't get me started about fucking Ballistic Fibre. Gotta visit all the Military locations just to get some Military Ammo Bags, Military Grade Duct tape and American trifolds. 
---
Full o diseased rat babies livin in the innards. A protection head is probably prime rat baby nest real estate

You can get past the loading screen you must teach me

I would argue that iron ore is worth getting too, great source for steel. Ammo crafters always need steel 
---
&gt; Space Invaders 1978?
---
It was probably Pong. That was the first one I remember seeing next to pinball machines back in the day.
---
&gt; I complain like everyone else, but I also see the miracle of it all.
---
I used to fantasize about being able to get on a computer and just look anything up back in the seventies. I was a weird kid. Online video games and streaming are just icing on the cake.
---
Just reached level 50 yesterday still half the map to explore enjoying the game very much no need to rush 
---
It slows down after level 40-50 though but I suppose my comment was aimed more at people who either can't wait for that or want to "support Berthesda" for some weird reason - they're a corporation, they exist to make money and the reason their games have always been so unprofessionally put together and full of bugs is because they're greedy hacks that can't be arsed to programme something of quality and would rather make their customers suffer bugs and bad design and ruin enjoyment because they're greedy and they have greedy investors who are more important that us - the customer.
---
May as well, it's my default if bored.  Either quest trips, I pillage defiance, or both.  Line in the Sand also drops a legendary as well.if memory serves.
---
The other day, I took on four dudes above level 50, with TSEs, in full power armor. I proceeded to take each one out in between 1-2 punches. The thing is, I use a dense combat chest, run fireproof 3, and adamantium skeleton 3. Explosives do nearly 0 damage, and don't even have a chance to cripple limbs. I killed each of them around 4 times before they stopped banging their head against the wall. At some point, a fifth guy showed up, whipped out a non-explosive gauss, and I took some damage. I took cover, stimpacked, and promptly killed him with a flying marsupial punch.
---
The point here is, and a lot of people don't realize it, no only did they nerf explosives, they added a way to get around 80% explosive damage reduction into the game. TSEs are still serviceable, AAE's and FEs are better, but if you shoot them at a player there's a chance it'll do nothing, and they just need one armor mod and a rank 3 endurance perk. I eat grenade bouquets for breakfast. I have been known to punch cars to kill a mob of scorched, just because I know it won't hurt me, and I certainly didn't spend 25K on sentinel assassin or cavalier assassin.
---
 My advice? Pick up an anti-armor, 25% faster handmade. Build for commando, tank killer, and focused fire. VATS, and hold down the trigger until they stop twitching. Explosives are a liability in PVP, now. If I couldn't fall back on my admittedly suboptimal, non-bloodied/unyielding melee build and bullshit marsupial shenanigans for PVP, I would have hung up my AAE handmade. She still clears Harper's just fine, though, and that's all I really ask for.
---
Yeah, steel, lead and acid are a constant struggle.
---
Oh that too... I just wait until the last minute to repair armor. I have a good route I can run to get enough to repair a couple pieces at a time.
---
I cleared the town for a while, looted the buildings near the church, entered the church, looted inside, went to the altar, looted the dead body priest, then the Behemoths spawned 
---
Well if there's a booze and even more psycho in it count me in lol
---
Does that crate say "acme" on it anywhere?
---
Yeah, repairing prior to almost breaking just doesn't make any sense. I'm lvl 43 or something and I still run around with my Heavy Leather Armor (safe for the Leather Right Leg). 
---
They are mutant Jawas.
---
I haven't tried but I assume full zealot with sentinel would negate most or all damage, but you would still have to kill them before you get irradiated/diseased to death. 
---
Are you just too stoned playing fallout and got confused?
---
I dunno that EVERYTHING is better than TSE, I'd generally rather have two shot than Junkie's or Berserker's. :D It really isn't worth the loss of Vats useability now though, for sure.
---
Ah so every time I mention they have fixed most of the bugs I have to list literally every update that has happened since launch?
---
Ok I’m gonna hop online in half hour will let you know how it goes
---
I think their damage is explosive energy? Try the fireproof perk.
---
Grounded, full sentinel and a marine wetsuit is what I wear. They don't touch me
---
If you are in excavator, you should walk out with about 350 ore, not 50.
---
With super duper you should end up with around 1100 lead scrap.
---
Or you could read the post... just a thought.
---
It is energy
---
What do you mean it died? I'm still in it and use it.
---
Flatwoods gets a lot of traffic and the enemies lvl is pretty low? Nice area too
---
Wow! Just learned too much from this post, for me, both styles were just called "retro" until now. Thanks.
---
I have been considering this! A lot of people like my camp and sometimes I wanna offers some advice to folks. It just sucks I can’t use AS stuff.
---
Yeah my mistake. Haven't done it in a while and first time i did it was without Escavator PA.
---
Not that I've noticed much amd I've run a couple toons to 80's.  I typically earn them faster then interesting stuff is offered and float in the 2-4 k range.  I just chime in because these discussions tend to be binary and ignore that folks can buy a handful of things with challenge atoms.
---
As for the shop, it's a given when they offer free content.  Money has to come from somewhere, these days its typically whales.
---
My 3 star super sledge disappeared two days ago.. it wasn't the best weapon (junkies with 40% swing speed and some random attribute) but it was my best sledge. After it went missing, literally swapped it for my axe and it was gone. I thought maybe server lag got it like I dropped stuff and it didn't register until later but I thought it was super odd. I got it as a drop from whitesprings so I know 100% it wasnt duped into circulation. 
---
actually a long time ago when i was running around clarksburg doing a quest with two or three friends, 5 level 50 behemoths spawned on my friend when he was on his level 20 alt. we thought the spawn was just glitched because of my friend who was level 120 at the time and we couldnt figure out a better explanation but apparently it wasnt a random glitch :|
---
were you alone or did you have a group with you? it could be that if you’re in a bigger group it might spawn something crazy because when i’ve been solo or with just one friend it’s been just basic super mutants
---
Thanks for the trade fast and friendly service great prices!!
---
Power armour and melee being so much better really confuses me, especially as they are less fun to play IMO
---
Here's another cool urban ruin. [RAF Upwood](https://www.urbanghostsmedia.com/2016/05/raf-upwood-modern-ruins-abandoned-raf-base/),  which was a US Air Force installation until the 2000s. 
---
So much so that "AAA Publisher" is a joke now and it needs it's own meme because all it means to mean is a bunch of corporate pricks who only give a shit about money and not producing a game.
---
Indy developers on the other hand put their heart and soul into their games, trying to make it the best experience possible so what does that tell you about the games industry? Just Google at the games developed by ONE person. It's so easy to see how these huge Dev houses are either incompetent or lying.
---
"AAA Publisher" these days means bug ridden and fleece ridden as they try to "monetise" shit that's free in other games. Just look at FO76 for example - the biggest Asset flipped game created recently that just taks all the stuff you paid for in FO4 and then tries to sell you that crap back in FO76 - why is there even a cash shop - What the actual fuck does it add to anyone's experience? That it caters for dickheads who like being ripped off?
---
The "Gaming Industry" should be embarrassed right now.
---
You have high expectations don't you haha
---
I was alone and there were no other players in my vicinity.  This alt was level 49.
---
Ha!
---
I was just getting on to write the exact same 2 points
---
I do have to say that I am far more insulted by the horrendous writing 
---
Yeah the mandated grind is really starting to get to me. I set up my camp on an acid deposit. It helps but it’s not enough. 
---
Fireproof and dense
---
Some form of battle royal 3 sides, pick only one, either supermutants, mole miners, scorched. Each have a base, each side goes and destroys each other, you the player mutate to look like your side. These NPC's are over the top hard to kill, to make it worth while. Have a scoreboard so end of the week the winning faction gets higher end loot. This is not PvP or PvE but somewhere in between.
---
One time I found a camp with only a keypad door and the owner put furniture near the window on purpose (I’m assuming). I really needed to scrap some stuff so I may have used that to sneak my way in. :(
---
Fuck to the yes
---
If they abandon it, I will destroy them with a nuke.
---
Oh no, that outfit made me change servers once. Too creepy. No. 
---
well that’s odd, maybe it’s just a really small % chance of spawning them because i’ve only seen it once but i’ve gone tgrough there dozens of times
---
To be fair, maybe it came in a pack
---
To be fair...
---
Well I have been bulking up mats since release mainly to sell on to vendors.  I realised after a while bulking never seemed to save much space.  It’s only since the last patch that I found out only Aluminium and Lead reduce in weight.  I hope when they fix the current issue with bulk items being scrapped they also fix this issue.  Clearly the intention behind bulking was to free up a little weight, else it’s a tremendous waste of plastic just to convert an item into a sellable one. 
---
Just use fireproof perk it blocks the damage.
---
I did some searching and found that Costco has the FO76 Xbox Bundle on sale for $349. So I ordered it. There bundle also came with an Extra Controller (not needed but it's 'free') and a 3 month Game Pass card.  
---
While I'd love to have the exclusive white gamestop edition, this one was cheaper by $60 and offered another $60 +/- in extras. So it was a much better value. Glad I did. I just looked at their site and it's already gone.
---
If god had intended for mole miners NOT to be slaughtered he would have stopped them dropping so much lead scraps.
---
Oh well, if I'm a dick I might as well go all in and destroy the whole thing while I'm at it, since I';m such a dick.
---
PC?
---
Happy to hear! Modern and Post-Modern architecture is a wonderful rabbit hole to go down into. 
---
Sneak, or die so they change target to another player.
---
Huh, I'm swimming in gears and screws, constantly short on springs. 
---
Grilled Scorchbeast Brain
---
Thank you for the info, maybe there is a chance to still get them at Grafton then. 
---
I mean I have 400 springs / enough lead to keep me supplied + a friend / plastic for days - so much of every material I bulk and sell it - and 9 screws 
---
No, that was fixed in the last patch (or rad it the one before?).
---
Xbox one :&lt; sorry pal
---
Eww, brain is chewy tho!!
---
It shouldn’t be hard to test.  Will need to find the spawn trigger, clear, logout and repeat 
---
Gamer tag?
---
You guys are locking your doors meanwhile i'm thinking about where to place my camp so people find and use it...
---
I wish all player camps are shown on the map :)
---
Yeah I'm wondering how long before they patch this "exploit", rather than fixing the real problems they have.
---
yeah, and plastic should NOT be used to bulk like........acid?
---
Fallout 76 makes me sad
---
If your on a team its technically 76 right?
---
fake!!  lol
---
Better yet, make it a quest to enable that mechanic!
---
I find it ridiculous that you got downvotes for not having issues. 
---
This.  I think hitting the panic button causes more issues than it fixes.  I think they also need a little time to work out exactly how they screwed the pooch on the last patch so it isn’t repeated.
---
I like fast traveling to vault 76 then putting heavy leather chest pieces in boxes around it 
---
I only wear power armour for the SBQ fights
---
well if it helps, for me they spawned right next to that building next to the yellow schoolbus that blocks the road close to the shooting area. hard to say exact location offhand but i can give you more details later if you actually wanna investigate it
---
Well going to the doc today. So maybe they find something new. :)
---
Problem is, did the region we play at ever got hit by bombs? I got the feeling thats not the case.
---
That's not the original. Completely different shot and angle. But yes the OP pic is disgusting don't know what the person was thinking. 
---
Also don't always blame the photog. Lots of so called "retouchers" who can't even work a camera do this kind of shit.
---
Every game needs improvement there is no such thing as a perfect launch nor a perfect game. How ever the degree people still claim the game is fucked up is far over exaggerated. I shouldn't be capable of the 3 or 4 hour play sessions I have without any issues.  
---
I have almost no server issues when I play. My few friends who have this scattered across the USA, Canada and UK have almost no server issues when they play. Yet when I look on this sub reddit even taking into account the tendency towards hyperbole that people have. It seems like every other person can barely play due to server issues.  Now my understanding of networking and servers is fairly basic but I some how find it hard to believe, unless you live in Australia that the server issues are so extreme in differences.  Because Australia gets bent over because most servers are situated in Asia. Particularly since they blame Bethesda for the server issues.
---
If it was purely Bethesda then everyone should be experiencing similar issues which we aren't. It seems like it is either their own internet connection, ISP or something else. 
---
&gt; criticism is bullshit peddled by people who didn't play the game.
---
Because it isn't hard to find someone repeating the same bullshit talking points while admitting they never played the game.  You can usually spot them pretty well because they often still complain about mobs T posing. Something that hasn't been in game for over a month at this point. 
---
It is both. Energy damage with an explosive modifier. Fireproof works well against their spam screech
---
I pick up all the ores, and I do often run low on acid. Also right now I have my camp in the spot with steel and copper extractors. Copper is used in electrical, but also in some weapons.
---
Since you only get ores and not scrap from all the metal and mineral collectors except steel and lead, it feels kinda unbalanced. Hemlock Holes workshop will fix the shortage, but I crash a lot more often when I have that workshop, so I make sure not to take any others at the same time.
---
Also, love smelting all the crystal and silver and gold and then selling it.
---
Thanks for doing the test, I've tried with several names I wrote down from previous sessions and it doesn't work. They may have added some extra security to prevent *friend request* spam maybe, once I hit enter the name is deleted and nothing happens.
---
Not a problem really, was going to try buying sera from traders but I did the BlackWater Mine lottery and luckily got a good set. Cheers :)
---
That makes sense since the version OP posted has graffiti on the left side. 
---
Raw glowing meat.  
---
The building with the mannequins, locked terminal door and the crafting bench?  And I’m down 
---
Ghost people were scary as hell.
---
What platform are you on? I’m on PC. Have around 300 hours and not once have I had another player attack my camp.
---
We've all been there! You always think they're going to not only add more, but add what "you" specifically want. That's not going to happen though and just looking at what Bethesda have thought up so far, they're just going to end up fucking it up.
---
For an example, look at the recent nerfs - showing how clueless they are but we've all played the game, up until now, with our weapons doing an expected damage out put and THEN they go and change everything because they were incompetent to begin with? And they're competent now? 
---
How many times have we seen developers completely screw up their game because they couldn't be bothered to hire an actual professional. Jesus, if *any* of them played a fucking online game they'd know what to do but instead they fuck with the game and expect us, the customers, to put up with it.
---
The gaming "industry" has been in decline for years - ever since they started with that BS about not allowing us to host our own servers. Now we have micro-transactions on full priced games. Support Indy developers, they have more imagination and aren't ripping anyone off.
---
That would cool. More options to personalize our camps.
---
See I think allowing for a total free respec would make the game SUPER EASY. People keep asking for it but it would totally diminish what little replay value it still has. While I think allowing a total respec for free at anytime is too much, I don't think being able to seperate your ranked perk cards would be too much. It's just kinda BS for me to stock up on all the rifleman perks to relize I should really replace three of them with bloody mess... So that means 3 more levels getting cards I already have gotten 9 times... When you level the point is to get NEW cards, or move a special point. I personally feel like allowing to move a special point every level is more than enough fair for a respect. When changing your build requires more than 20 levels, it would, and should be easier for you to make a new one. There's no point in changing a single build that much. 
---
It took you 2 hours to claim it? why
---
yup just randomly got them again as well
---
I mean, it would have been 2 packs but whatevs
---
Well atleats i did not choosed you, as my victim for  "Give me food or die" player interaction.
---
It doesn't have to be hit by bombs to scare people into a mine
---
Perk cards wipe their ass with that.
---
Lokilorddusty  :3
---
I use a dumpster as my stash box because it both amuses me and seems more appropriate for the amount of stuff in it.
---
Hope not, I enjoy playing, if numbers are too low they will have to shutdown the servers.
---
I absolutely hate Mole Miners and when me and my friend encountered them for the first time I said "I am going to be obscenely racist towards them" then prococeded to call them "Hole Diggers" as a slur
---
Xbox One.
---
Any more information needed? Sounds like this is a pretty common issue not limited to console...
---
&gt; Forget about the tse thing. Or banning dupers. 
---
Nah because I watch the community explode into out rage and legitimately try to validate their anger by saying they want it so they should get it. 
---
&gt;  Having reddit posts edited or removed. Removing posts on their own forum. Banning users for daring to criticize them.
---
So your going paranoid conspiracy theory route. A new one for this game but not unexpected.  If that had any truth to it r/fallout and r/76 would have half their posts removed. As would 3/4th of the posts in the bethesda community.
---
What you are confusing is constructive criticism with just being an ass hole for no reason other then to be an ass hole.  People who are ass holes get removed while people who offer constructive criticism stays. 
---
Nice idea. However what I tend to do is simply sell some junk that's lying around to cover the cost, especially if I haven't anything to sell to start with. 
---
Why did it take you two hours to claim the workshop?  You know you don't have to repair the power plant to claim it, right?
---
Repairing power plant events are definitely not worth the time and effort.  Definitely now that the power generator plans are readily available for low cap cost at vendors.
---
You buy hydrochloric acid in plastic containers?
---
Yeah because nobody could play more or grind more than you. You're the best.
---
the first thing i thought about it, if it wasn't a disconnect, it most likely would have been contested.
---
i have reached the point in game where i have no ammo, no fusion cores for my PA, no caps, and next to no scrap, and everytime i earn enough caps to try and claim a workshop, the instant i finish claiming it and setting up resource collectors, the game has either crashed, frozen, or ive been killed by another player and my workshop stollen.
---
i literally have no reason to continue playing at this point.
---
My shotgun beats locks, then again so does my pick lock rank 3. Plus I like to look around before the carnage begins.....
---
I currently keep a Tse gauss as a main. I would love to see it with AA. I have to admit that the drop from 1.8k to 383 damage was alot. 
---
[BethesdaReplied](https://www.reddit.com/user/BethesdaReplied) Please add a buy back option at vendors within the first min or ability to lock your weapons and armor you want to keep. I have done this to my horror when trying to unload a lot of items
---
You making a video?
---
You must do something wrong. 
---
take a look at the "known bugs" sticky and look at how long these bugs have been around. not little visual stuff, game breaking things like the SBQ sometimes flying off the edge of the map and never returning. Every single time I do queen runs, half the people cant pick up any loot.
---
look at what fallout 76 has to offer, the current "popular" fad is that people now figured out how to stack foundations because the game continues to be a buggy mess. I cent even share any perks beyond a lv1 card because it glitches after a few seconds, and thats a NEW bug that was introduced with the hotfix after patch 5, and dont get me started on the radworms bug that makes marsupial(and many other things) stop working.
---
stop being a blind fanboy, its downright embarrassing.
---
I am pretty sure the quest timer is under an hour so it's just hyperbole. 
---
However, I'd recommend just building a fusion generator and plugging it in.
---
I joined in on a scorched earth event. I didn't nuke it. I used 20 radaways because I had mutations and didn't want them to be silenced by radx. 
---
The point of this post was not what I was doing wrong, it was cast a spotlight on the bad rewards we get for taking her down.
---
"You know you don't have to repair the power plant to claim it, right?"
---
your fucking kidding me.
---
Yeah and the game gives you the resources so you can build it for free anyway.
---
My issue with this whole thing is that there are one or two builds that are awesome at soaking ALL THE DAMAGE, and only one or two builds that are capable of countering them. Any other build or play style is useless in PvP (which, like it or not, I sometimes get stuck engaging in). If you wanna survive you have to throw any kind of originality or personal preferences out the window and do what everyone else is doing. 
---
I choose to stash my junk like every 5 minutes, and get killed in PvP when it does happen (even by people half my level, which is ridiculous). Totally worth the inconvenience to be able to keep playing the way I want to, and not the way shitty PvP mechanics dictate.
---
45 minutes to fix the reactor because i've never done it before, 20 minutes setting up the collectors and fending off a buggy wave of feral ghouls, and then another 20 claiming the nearby scrap yard for the junk collectors.
---
Repairing it gives free energy to some workshops, but you can power the workshop with your own generators if power plan energy isn't available.
---
No he is not. Bad HDR massively increases saturation he is not wrong to say that. 
---
Also you are confusing processing an HDR photo and I assume HDR monitors. The entire point of processing a photo in HDR is so normal monitors and TVs can see all the dynamic range. You do NOT need a "display that can show it" to view an HDR image (in the traditional sense)
---
Too much common sense or good, well thought out gameplay for Bethesda. 
---
Just finished totally redoing my camp today. While I was well into decorating the interior, a “griefer” gave me a warm welcome by destroying all of my stuff. It wasn’t that big of a deal all in all, but it definitely was frustrating to have just built these things and then have someone profusely stab your hard work with their doom filled fist weapon of choice, right before your eyes. But also in your eyes as he seemed to enjoy destroying my face about as much as he did my stuff. 
---
The location is pretty decent. My only complaint so far is the consistent horrific screams of an NPC somewhere. But whatever, neighbors are neighbors. There’s a junk pile in my yard, so I’m willing to live with the murderous screams off in the distance. If anything,I think it adds character. 
---
I call them mole people
---
If you want a strong build, you're going to have to sacrifice QOL perks... Make a new character for that or deal with a more well rounded all in one character. The game would be 0 fun if you could have max everything. I understand (if you did it right) you could max 100 everything in FO3. This is a multiplayer game. At then end of it, you can't be a god like that. It wouldn't be very fun.
---
I think I've seen it before. Thanks. Guess I'm switching over to small purifiers. 
---
"bangs head on desk repeatedly"
---
I’m on PS4 and really want this jumpsuit. Any leaded or anyone who doesn’t want it I’d love to meet up. I’ll pay caps or trade items. 
---
I want an event with the Underminer because the SBQ isn't enough boss 
---
But doing those events, at least before the recent patch, rewards you with the plans for the 3 generators including large, fusion and windmill. So it was good to do them a few times anyway. I don't know if that changed when they made the plans available at vendors in the recent patch though.
---
[PvP is goood.](https://youtu.be/eN0hbQALkag)
---
Yeah I wasn't too happy either that my tse lever action rifle was nerfed from 819 to 236 but hey gota live with it :(
---
AA and AAE seem to be the new tse's now in the meta  
---
Nope
---
Yeah, I was super into it at first. Back in November I finally got the launch codes and was doing a pretty good solo run through the Silo and got disconnected. Haven’t played since. Maybe one day when/if they get their shot worked out.
---
pacifist is broken as well. People can still damage you and hit you. Why would I want to have that on if I get ambushed by someone? Then I have to go into the menu, go to settings, turn it off, and then die defending myself because it was so annoying
---
I wish Bethesda would take some notice of that little dev team in Guildford England.  My god their game was a mess to start with, but its come on leaps and bounds. Plus its all free new content. 
---
I used to think the same thing, but later on I started actually using some of my lower rank extras. They can be really useful if you need to switch things up a bit. For example, I had Luck 4 and used to keep Good With Salt 2 and Luck Of The Draw 2 until I got mutations I liked and needed Starched Genes 2. Was damn glad I still had rank 1 versions of the other two, cause it's a damn sight better than only being able to equip rank 2 of one or the other. I have a few others I use that way as well, depending on what I'm doing.
---
I have to say, I really enjoy the flexibility of the card system. I know a lot of folks have complaints about it, but I think it works. The only thing it lacks is the ability to save custom presets to make swapping them easier.
---
&gt;Grounded, full sentinel and a marine wetsuit is what I wear. They don't touch me
---
Sorry what is grounded? is that the armor type?
---
Please fix the bug where if you shoot any vehicle and it blows up, it instantly makes you wanted.
---
I was recording, but there was not much reaction, most people have game muted probably. So it was mostly murdering people in their workshops. I made [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/and6b4/i_spent_4_hours_as_a_raider_asking_for_food_in/) about it and guys here were sensitive af so i ended up not doing video on youtube. But if you are interested in pvp [i did some.](https://youtu.be/eN0hbQALkag)
---
Where is this? That's one loading screen we all need for when it gets stuck
---
Totally disagree, I thought it was brilliant and was laughing my ass off the whole time. And I loved the names of the ghouls :D
---
Evidently you are extremely out of touch. There have been plenty of game breaking problems. Again, just because you don't have them, doesn't mean they don't exist. Get out of your own little world and join the real one.
---
Brahmin Steak probably isn’t too bad... probably.
---
Stagger and headshots
---
I would LOVE to see the ability to upgrade legendaries level similar to the Mistress of Mysteries weapons which sort of falls under this 
---
Not fear mongering ,fact. It's pay to win,period.
---
gee thanks for the downvotes, way to make me feel better.
---
Ridiculously strong compared to characters as they are now. I'm with u/shankwelle \- this is not a good idea.
---
I have 12 frames in my stash and don’t know which ones are which so this would be helpful so I could sell the ones that are no use to me
---
Even just scrap legendaries for stable flux
---
If I'm on tonight I'll come by and check it out. PSN: R-C-MAN
---
There is a lot I wish I could sell at my own vendor, I know that's coming.
---
Not soon enough :)
---
RC
---
there are a few level 2000 players, though i have not seen anyone above 300 in weeks.
---
Totally Agree, would be nice to scrap (want a Double Verify request button to ensure though) legendary items for higher value materials.  I hate not using some yet it doesn't make sense to constantly roll overburdened. 
---
Speaking of OB-This last Sunday I unloaded 15 Mini-Nukes, 15 Missiles and about 1000 rounds of 5mm &amp; 10MM, 100+ cloth, steel and leather in Multiple Storage Lockers in the 3rd-4th Floors of Fort Defiance just to slim down and help others.
---
I've never found Legendary items in paper bags though, may have to roll back to the springs more often.
---
Definitely worth getting. 
---
Your boys and girls all died. We've still got an entire bunker with fancy shit and butlers. Sorry for your loss...
---
I have a feeling they're something to do with the FEV, so they have more in common with supermutants than the scorched. But who knows.
---
I dislike killing them. But they have useful loot and, well, they try and kill you.
---
I mean we all know who’s going to rule West Virginia in the end so...
---
What armor/paint is that you’re wearing?
---
You absolutely can get a bounty while in pacifist mode just as described above.
---
Still gives the plans.  But the plans are also always available at a number of vendors, and with Hard Bargain 3 on, the Fusion Generator plans are less than 400 caps.  So even without Hard Bargain 3 it is very affordable.
---
The vendor plan update made powering up events more pointless than before.  It's much easier to sell 200 caps worth of garbage to 3 vendors and buy the Fusion Generator plan, which makes all the others pointless, than it is to spend 45 minutes running around a nuclear plant trying to finish all the unmarked objectives.
---
It'd be different if the generator plans were more costly at vendors.  But they are not.
---
The game is so bad now that we are being offered even worse fiction about it. Sad read.
---
I know where your camp is....
---
Look for a log cabin retreat by your house in the forest.
---
Then follow the wires to find your screaming neighbor.....
---
Muhahaha....
---
They do say they're *loose* screws. maybe those 2 screws you looted are after they detect how many would potentially fall out over the course of your simulated adventure?
---
It hasn't been long enough for all that, I think, but I love the idea.
---
I think they should have eliminated fast travel altogether. The train stations should have been the only travel points. They just needed to add a few more. 
---
Have some robot NPCs that use the old man-powered rail carts that transport you
---
Git gud kid I’ve been sitting with a 1000 cap bounty since Monday.
---
Wow that looks awful from the inside. 
---
I just want the ability to change the rank on a maxed out card.  I don’t see an incentive to max out all these cards then reobtain them to have a lower rank for build shuffling 
---
Is this a specific last one of just generally?
---
make it like the misc. quests. Where you can go over to a sub menu
---
I came here to say that. Once it's enabled, do not make it a free travel point but rather a free "tourist travel" just like vertibirds in Fallout 4. Make the actual train work. 
---
We are supposed to rebuild West Virginia, start with the transports. 
---
Ya mon, you kill like 6-8 scorched in the area near the workshop then slap down your fusion generator (will require some\* of your own mats). 3-5 min.
---
If you have a workshop you do not have to pay caps to travel to it so I don’t understand your statement”waste too many caps going to collect every 30 mins”
---
T51 is better than ultracite
---
&gt; constantly short on springs.
---
Fort McClintock, Sugar Grove, the National Radio Astronomy Research Center, and the National Isolated Array.
---
The latter 3 are within short walking distance of each other and can be hit one right after the other. Tons of clipboards floating around. And typewriters. 
---
I'm not gay, but +1 perception is +1 perception.
---
Pacifist stops you doing damage to players, it does not stop them doing damage to you.
---
What you are suggesting would make you invincible to PVP....A griefer’s dream!!
---
Man. I went through that cave today. Fuck that cave and everything in it.
---
The targeting on melee is complete doo doo. You'll have to shank the enemy 10 times in different places to get it to go down. VATS is basically the only saving grace, even if it only works half the time
---
Lol I just jump. Can’t stagger me while I’m in midair and sentinel still works if you jump in place.
---
Allow you to rename the suit to what you want...
---
on PC you can. and it's not that useful because you still have to bring the pipboy up.
---
it'd be better to just make passive skills permanently active. who the hell is gonna unequip Weapon Artisan *before* fixing a weapon?
---
makes no sense.
---
Same here my chest piece is above the outfit. 
---
Dude... the noises aren’t random... they’re speaking. 
---
if you listen to the cadence of their grunts, and when they say certain series’ of grunts... they’re definitely speaking. It’s distorted AF but if you spent time around it consistently, as the other miners do, I guarantee there’s language there. I swear I heard one say “oh god oh god” when he died yesterday. They are sentient. 
---
This is how I imagine this conversation goes with the devs and CM.
---
"They would like scrapping weapons to give a screw"
---
"Sweartogod...One more complaint out of you and ill make scrapping *use* screws"
---
 "But Bill, that doesnt make any se--"
---
 "I HAVE SPOOKEEN!!!"
---
I feel bad for playing 170 hours. I was like... man, that’s waaay too much time to put into a video game. It’s been out only a few months! 
---
You.
---
I promised myself I wasn't going to reply to one of these, but here I am.
---
If you got screws for every weapon you scrapped your stash box would be over flowing with screws, and then you'd be back on here whining about stash space
---
People are surpirsed that wearing a huge mechanical tank suit is better then not wearing it?  
---
Also they already said mod support is going to arrive but not for a little while, probably november time
---
Ya.. this is insane. Maybe they're all getting fired, or there's some restructuring going on or something... Hopefully... Anything.. because this is nuts.
---
I'm thinking about setting up more sales windows for visiting vendors
---
True.  
---
suppresed rifles because I got a bunch of suppresed Gauss rifles and combat rifles during a Glassed Cavern run
---
Bury the workshop station in a bunch stash boxes so players can reach it.
---
Level 160ish (I forget been a week since I logged in) here. I’ve been a PA heavy weapons build since my 90s and ammo is ZERO problem for me. I do not mine for ore. Complete waste of time imho. All I can say is you guys are going about this the wrong way if you’re mining for ore for ammo.  
---
Ok now I finally understand what Fallout always lacked. Graffiti. Imagine running around "decorating" player camps with "art". Glorious.
---
Just don't Bolt from the problem
---
Sounds like a bug.
---
wait, my bloodied pitchfork says it does 40% more power attack damage. does it have 2 legendary effects?
---
'50s/'60s
---
FTFY. 
---
You've got talent. And they say people who bought their armor online are pay 2 win.
---
You can't just select a deck, though. You still have to swap everything out one at a time.
---
Not sure if this relates, but i bought t51 calibrated shock plans.  
---
Have the perks to craft it.   For some strange reason, it shows i have all the materials but when i go to craft it says lack of materials.   
---
After couple min of frustration, i put the supplies into my stash. (Violet flux) Before i log, i decided to try again.  And it worked.   
---
Grounded in a mutation, it reduces energy damagebut raises energy defense
---
Haha Haha yeah it sucked
---
Get some higher level friends and do a run of Glassed Cavern. It gives you really good weapons, REALLY GOOD, like 150 damage per shot non-tse weapons
---
There are not a lot of players in any one place in the game. 
---
Then mole miners are legendary monsters I love it
---
(¬_¬)
---
Hate that card system too..
---
yes but that's the thing, I've tried it and it's just a very minor QoL improvement. after a while you realize it's essentially the same as before.
---
It doesnt it just means the miserable moaners who do nothing but tell everyone how they uninstalled this game nithing new to moan about 
---
If you can't interact with player-placed stuff, can't hurt people, and can't be hurt by them I don't see a problem with it (like GTA V passive mode)
---
Whomever it was that dropped the free PA Chassis last night at the station has inspired me to dump extras of those too!
---
Look for hazmat suits. +1000 rad resistance if you find a good one or just make sure u have rad sponge upgraded
---
Solution: 
---
-Lock your extractors/purifiers if you want. Point missile turrets at them for anyone dumb enough to pick an owned lock :D
---
-Lock your house against enemies (it's only sensible) but put a tall brick window next to the door. You can jump through those when crouched, so passersby can craft/stash/sleep.
---
-Build yourself a little panic room inside for when you need to afk. Either a (keypad) locked door or no door at all, just four walls. 
---
Also, I lock my bedroom door because it's like Three-Bears-level-creepy when you come in and someone is sleeping in your bed. I have a guest bedroom with two beds. Stay outta mine, Goldilocks.
---
Fallout 76 makes me sad. 
---
&gt;  If you go on any other subreddit, or a different gaming forum, or a place like youtube, you'll find people are overwhelmingly negative about the game.
---
Yea and 3/4ths of them haven't played it and just parrot what people on youtube tell them to. Because there is no way youtubers might benefit from jumping on the bandwagon of popular opinions for financial reasons. 
---
&gt; If you legitimately believe people are going to look back on the game as anything short of a disaster, you're a lost cause. 
---
So are you for deciding judgement before all your chickens have been counted. 
---
If they give us singleplayer why not?
---
I like this a lot, would be really amazing to see.
---
That was only from Hines, and only if Launch went smoothly.
---
Obviously, launch was... rocky at best.
---
Lol I didn’t buy it I farmed my ass off for 300 hours and then traded what I got for individual pieces of it. Still can’t find anyone that has a sent ass marine left arm.
---
Bethesda needs to fix their game.
---
If only such an idea could come into fruition...
---
I haven't been able to test but grab a set of trapper armor, some rad X and Radshield, maybe the perk too and try going in like that
---
We should be able to scrap weapons and armor, to repair like items. 
---
Scrap a revolver: repair any revolver up to 50% of max health, or an identical revolver up to 75%. Scales with Gun Nut.
---
Failing that, if it was needed to build the gun, we should get some if it back on scrapping. Including screws.
---
That we cant do this, is ridiculous. 
---
Just let me know what you're looking for, I literally have tons of stuff to trade, including:
---
* 100+ Legendary Armor pieces
---
* A good selection of Legendary weapons
---
* Over 100 Plans &amp; Recipes (including many rare ones)
---
* Lots of Mods
---
* A healthy supply of Chems, Bobbleheads, magazines, and treasure maps.
---
* Could also work a deal on Power Armor, or mods for yours, I currently have several available.
---
I'm a scrounger/explorer at level 120 with over 500 hours, &amp; 5 characters.
---
Except blowing up cars near players or their stuff can still hurt them since the explosion damage doesn't get negated by pacifist.
---
Best bet is run through another enemy camp (ai not player) and hope the scorched beast gets distracted so you can run
---
The word is *foolproof*.  As in, *"Even a fool could not mess this up.*"
---
Your little robots dont even stand a chance against our unholy lord Mothman. Keep fighting each other, we will watch and claim west Virginia while you guys hide in your little bunker.
---
What's interesting is that there are some weapons, like the hunting rifle, that have large visible screws on the weapon itself yet you cannot scrap that material. They have been easy enough for me to find in the game though, not too concerned imo.
---
I doubt zealot would work, I have zealot weapons that don’t seem to do any extra damage towards scorchbeasts so I’m assuming it doesn’t for armour. 
---
Yeah, I've had my camp leveled by other players even when everything was totally open and built specifically for others to use whatever they needed (including massive starch farm). Assholes will be assholes, no matter what you do or don't lock.
---
Doh, worth asking :) Thanks for letting people know just the same.
---
Completing the quest could result in armed "escort bots" at each station, for immersion. Some of the tracks are too far gone to repair out in the world.
---
I’d be all in on the ability to assign decks as needed.   On console it’s a pain because you have to switch each card manually and then switch it back after.   Having decks you could pre-assign and throw on as necessary would be great.  
---
There’s an easy fix to this: 
---
1. Grab all the junk out of your stash
---
2. Jump into a fissure site 
---
This should make your water purifiers produce the correct amount. No need to thank me it’s what I’m here for.
---
Good to you lol...
---
Had a guy destroying my camp while I was in bed, calling me to PVP, guy had a TSE, not even funny, just told him I wasn't feeling it, the guy proceed to destroy my bad LMAO.
---
Someone came to collect his bounty, he was like in his 60s, the guy was maybe 150, got shit on almost 100 levels above the guy, seems balanced.
---
You load sixteen tons, what do you get? 
---
Yeah I want this
---
First time?
---
Your method would result in the following:
---
Turn off Pacifist.....destroy someone’s base....turn pacifist back on and be invincible
---
Get it???
---
And let them hold more than 5 waters at a time
---
Like GTA V
---
Can't turn passive with a bounty, so no it wouldn't.
---
Set your map marker near Black Titanium. Start walking. Summons an SB every time.
---
I’m not, I’m just a man who looks for his source of protein in the form of the blood of my enemies 
---
This would save on so many caps that it would be almost be like a cheat.
---
So now you basically play Fortnite without the base building and you don't take any damage......just jumping up and down.
---
But fusion cores are so easy to find.  I basically live in PA, and only carry 5 cores on me at any time.  If I get low, I can collect 6-8 cores in about 5 minutes. You just need to know where to look
---
Time for the mercy all players showed Bethesda for weeks to be returned. Get your players unbanned.  I'm sure they have legend they're lesson and will no longer pick up brown bags full of loot.  And if you've fixed duping, well great. 
---
Why have they not released it?
---
A Lot of the Left Arm Armors, Light leather for example, Do not have any on the forearm due to pipboy, yet in 1st person it does and it clips a lot in the forearm and wrist area. Simple fix of just removing forearm stuff in 1st person.
---
I really think specials should be completely changeable at any time at no cost only thing that should be hindered is the perk cards you get every level.it gives more incentive to try new builds. With the way the system and respec is now...it’s just infinitely easier to make more and more characters from increased stash space to new builds at birth. Not having a fluid special change just hurts long term play 
---
It all depends on the complexity of the items in your camp. Anything with a lot of polygons takes up more budget so small furniture items take up a lot, and turrets take up a large amount. Most of this base is just simple cubes. 
---
thiissssssss would be so good rather than constantly having to fiddle with damage thingies and lockpick
---
same same. i wonder if it's because of looting habits, play style, or difference in repair/maintenance cost?
---
for example, i started running out of gears quickly when i capped a workshop every day because i always built a few turrets.
---
what?
---
The fix wouldn't nerf the game for their dwindling fanbase, so fuck us for expecting things to function as stated, right?
---
I think I saw you once! That gamer tag is so familiar!
---
\*broken
---
broke is either past tense or used to describe yourself being out of money.
---
This would interesting to see. Useful and theres a lot of demand for it.
---
I think they already know it. Its a matter of time they implement it.
---
you need them for that? not that it matters to me since ive never found enough stuff to launch one, kinda sucks tbh ive done every story mission there is and im kinda left with nothing to do other than scavange to fix my plasgat
---
Molerat on a stick
---
I think Charleston may have been hit by something light, but WV wasn’t a huge target.
---
Sneak attack rifle, explosive shot gun and melee. I actually don't find the sentries too bad but I suppose it depends on your build. Anything that can kill them in 1-4 hits quickly should do the trick. I find sentries are also pretty weak at range, they don't seem to have a lot of accuracy.
---
I played fallout 4 for around 1000 hours by the time the nuka world dlc came out so I wouldn’t be too concerned unless it’s hurting your social life, or ruining any healthy habits you’ve accumulated.
---
I like the passive perks idea; but still, I play on PS4 and if I could hotwheel perk decks on the D-pad or the like, I'd be able to switch it up pretty quickly based upon the situation. Because what happens is, I do fix something then realize I didn't put the Artisan perk on, or I get caught unawares by a mob of mutants and I've got all my weight and repair perks selected. Or even, team based selections vs, lone wanderer selections.
---
We do need ballistic fiber to craft any armor level 25+, if I remember right (since 2 patches ago, I think). It would be great if they added a perk similar to Power Patcher for weapons and armor. 
---
I don't have the same issue everyone else seems to be having with stuff breaking so fast, but maybe that's because I use Weapon Artisan/Fix It Good? Are these perks just not very commonly used? Never used White Knight, and it's been about 20 levels since I stopped keeping Gunsmith 5 on all the time. I usually use Luck Of The Draw tho.
---
That would be great. Somehow I wish each patch would add more repairs (or repair quests) to the world. 
---
I say they implement a pneumatic tube system, utilizing Pulowski Shelters as the entrance/exit. 
---
DLC
---
bAlAnCe
---
Aah ok
---
Just an FYI in case you haven't noticed. Luck of the Draw Rank 2 was bugged a couple of months ago. By bugged I mean broken because it does not proc. Only rank 1 and rank 3 work.
---
I don't believe it was in the patch notes that they fixed it. I have been running Rank 3 for a while and I feel like Rank 1 procced more. I have 14 luck btw.
---
women can have sick pecs too, man
---
I think there should be some cost.  But maybe a weekly or daily event, or something more tangible in cost (caps, materials, etc).  Daily or weekly event that requires you to build/repair some vault-tec research equipment that you use to "re-engineer" yourself.  Like the scorched-disease inoculation but a bit more complicated.
---
Currently with your character capping at 50, and every level beyond that just being perk or special redistribution, coupled with characters already existing in the 200+ range... The game has been locked as far as character progression.
---
Anything they do now to increase the real "cap" of your character based on leveling up will leave players above 50 already at a severe disadvantage.  They'll have to come up with a completely new system.
---
Actually pretty much anything they change now will be a blow to any 50+ characters who have already spent points.  It'd have to be a rollback on points spent, a perk/special reset, to make it fair.
---
I don’t even see why they changed it from fallout four. They kept almost the exact same weapons why change the materials you get from each perk of scrapper? 
---
Scrapper was a game changer in vanilla fallout four. Now it just sucks
---
There is just no pleasing some people.
---
Yeah...if you play the game like not just one but two full time jobs.
---
Please tell the Devs not to remove this small QoL quirk. These are the things we can enjoy and it won't be end of the world. 
---
I didn’t knowwwwww, the gun was loaded
---
I didn't notice, thanks for the heads up.
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **4th Cakeday** sly_1! ^(hug)
---
exactly, just the eastern side of that building, on the road near the stars
---
It can produce 60 and hou ONLY if you grab the 5 or whatever as the purifier has a weight limit.
---
Even if you log off, stuff will still be there.
---
Get some molotovs and go to whitesprings during a nuke. You can piggy back off the guys actually killing things for xp. Helped me get past that wall.
---
I had one gun in fallout 4, no armor.
---
and screws that pierced the sun
---
No fallout76 is not a battle Royale game that’s the worst comparison I’ve ever heard.
---
I like the idea. I really do. However, is the Travel Agent perk not good enough? It's free to travel to Vault 76. I have my hideout on the east side so I can travel to the east without paying any caps. The Travel Agent perk allows me to save caps when I need to travel anywhere else. It's pretty easy to sell enough junk to cover my travel costs and still max out on caps each day with Hard Bargain.
---
another reason i found the other day was the Stranger in numbers perk. I have that one because my wife and play together and both have mutations, like Marsupial.
---
While on the team, the mutations i have worked fine. She left our team later and i still had Stranger in Numbers on and my mutations were nerfed/messed up. 
---
No radwroms or rad-x...so what gives. I only have 3 perk cards (Stranger in numbers, class freak, and starched genes) that deal with mutations, so i decide to remove the Stranger in Numbers...all my mutation positive effects kick in...add the perk back, only left with the negative effects, take off all come back.
---
The card shouldn't penalize you if are mutated and not a team, you just shouldn't get the bonus. Seems a little buggy.
---
okay but I'm telling you I'm standing right next to it and it's not even getting to five. Except it's faster at work Shoppes than it is at your own settlement. That's obviously a bug 
---
I set up camp in the north wooded mountain area on top of an acid deposit for this reason. No one ever seems to bother to go up there but I kind of like the seclusion and lack of people messing up my base or just not being able to place my base.
---
We dont have mouse on ps4
---
I hate them. But that's only because I was level 10ish facing level 40s the first time I saw them.
---
my sweet selfless mic-less tincan dum-dum, take my pie.
---
Does it really? Someone please confirm
---
I have gunsmith 5 and gunsmith 1 and use both of the depending on the loadout, so sometimes there is a use for them. But yeah, hiding them would be nice.
---
Or, what if after level one hundred perk cards only cost half as much SPECIAL points to place in your deck?
---
damn. wheres the scorched?
---
This is how I roll and it doesnt compare to power Armor or hazmat suit. All upgraded trapper with lead lining and a lot of the legendary +25 RadResist. Rad shield. Still get 9rads per second. 
---
A lot of folks imply the possibility of hidden factors that make hazmat and power Armor the only viable solution, which from a real world perspective, does make sense. 
---
I always seem to have a ton of acid but I don't get it from resource extractions... I'd recommend tagging "acid" in your junk tab and just playing/exploring. When you tag a junk item it will show a magnifying glass every time you hover over an object that contains acid. You'll see a lot of unexpected items actually have acid in them.
---
I switched over to T-60 when I'm in close combat just because it's so cheap to repair compared to other PA or normal armor. No springs, screws or ballistic fiber needed.
---
I don't know what to tell you mine seem to make them on time 
---
I agree.
---
Fortnite requires skill to win. 
---
Fallout you just buy the most OP gear in the game and jump up and down to exploit broken game mechanics.
---
I love the weird self importance of this weird "everyone ACTUALLY agrees with me, they just are secret and hiding" thing you are trying to do. 
---
Actually though.... I went to Welch and started just picking them off with my hunting rifle silence until there was one little mole miner just walking around wondering where his friends are
---
Sturdy frame has 2 ranks, 25% and 50%.
---
As far as I know there is no perk to reduce armor weight by 90%.
---
&gt; The best counter to sentinel is any AA ( anti- armor) or AAE ( anti-armor explosive) coupled with tank killer perk maxed ( causes stagger + 36% anti-armor) add some penetrator mods to the weapon and your practically hitting them with no armor save
---
Too bad you're doing nothing to mitigate their damage reduction from the legendary effects and only the raw armor on top of that so you'll still barely be doing much damage to someone in full Sentinel Assassin armor.
---
*when you select the frame with your thumb stick, if you're a console peasant. #PcMasterRace
---
:D
---
not in soap 
---
when using "strange in numbers," if a teammate leaves your team, it nerfs your current mutations.
---
i.e. i have marsupial. when my teammate leaves the team, i jump like any other player without a mutation. removing the perk fixes this, but one time i had to log out to get it to revert. pretty sure it was while i was sharing strange in numbers with my squad.
---
A CAMP with resource Extractors, Water Purifiers, Rad Shower, &amp; Fusion Generator can easilt take 500-1000 caps worth of junk &amp; Flux to repair after some dickhead messes it up, and even if you're able to collect the Bounty on them, they usually don't have the caps to cover it, or if they do, they have a friend standing by to kill them before you get the chance.
---
I consider some of the tactics currently being used an Exploit of the fucked up PVP mechanics, but Bethesda is more concerned with banning players that crafted a few too many of some item than they are with fixing things like this.
---
If a player attacks your CAMP, you should be able to retaliate and recover your losses, but in the current state, they can destroy your camp, then have a friend collect their bounty, afterwards if you attack them, then you're the one with a bounty.
---
Sorry you got downvoted by salty sweaty Redditers, you made good points. Have an upvote.
---
I heard the rad resist legendary is bugged and doesn't stack with itself. Is that true?
---
While I agree with this from a "it makes sense" point of view and an early-on QOL change, I currently have something like 500 screws in my stash just from picking up Clipboards and Fans. I can't actually remember the last time I actually deliberately farmed screws with how many you can pick up just from keeping an eye out for these. For those screaming for them there's the commonly known areas (military camps, satellite buildings, etc) but Nuclear Silos are amazing for getting a decent amount of most resources as well. They're about the only place I get junk from nowadays and I have an excess of basically everything.
---
I know you're gonna get down voted to hell but that made me lmao
---
I think Wendigos are only in this game because they are lore native to the West Virginia area in real life. 
---
I was doing the DMV section of the Main story with my second character. Close the end of it the server crashed and I had to start over... 
---
It certainly doesn’t seem to affect the rad resist value of the item or my total rad resist value. I also suspect it might be broken. 
---
You know, now that I think about it, the extra perception must come from having the extra airflow. You can just sense where your enemies are by the change in air around your nuts... 
---
Noticed this last night
---
Found the Gourmand.
---
is there any lore behind them? i try to read any terminals and stuff i come across, but admittedly, i have not dug too deep into the ash heap. are they moles that turned humanoid? or man turned mole?
---
= Slothman
---
Cobbler is not pie. I was a pastry chef. 
---
I don't want you to tell me anything. This is flared as a bug.....
---
I finally did the same and it helped. I also find that White Springs is filthy with acid but it gets repetitive dropping Chameleon Wood Armor on the ground over an over.
---
I hear you. I think it's stupid that lvl 3 cards won't for into a lvl 1 or 2 slot just with less benefits. It kind of makes it pointless to combine some of them at all.
---
Yes except when I’m in my house in PA and still have rain drops on my screen. Breaks the mood. 
---
&gt;The great screw drought
---
Isn't that most of Reddit?
---
And yet you got downvoted by the puritanical Reddit snowflakes as they rush to their safe spaces and slam the doors shut.
---
This would be really cool, but I think 4A games has that part covered with the metro series, and also I just don’t quite think it fits Bethesda or the fallout series much, a sewer system would be better in my opinion. 
---
Inside the vault has been moved to Thursdays I thought. But yes the fact they introduced bugs that are super game breaking like the dmg bug back an have yet to fix it a week later is absurd.
---
You got them from scrapping weapons in fo4
---
Random note: love how the post has 10 downvotes from butthurt dupers and cheaters that troll my every post on this forum.  Such comedy. 
---
Sentinel is only effective if they are still, if they get staggered they are classed as moving which mitigates the sentinel effect. If quick enough after the first shot staggers you can hit them with the anti-armor perks/mods and if explosive that damage too before sentinel kicks back in
---
OOF
---
It’s debated. Several theories 
---
The Enclave V76 dwellers know about is a broken AI and some bots confined to a bunker that rely on human cooperation to get anything useful done.  You really have to go out of your way to interact with them. Not sure they are much of a threat by themselves.
---
That is a terrible raider policy
---
I dont really see the Free States wearing a uniform. Their whole point was that they were heavily independent and individualistic. 
---
Maybe a set of survival gear/armor unique to the region, like mirelurk shell plating held together with strangler vines and scavenged materials. Like Raleigh designed a set of armor easily made out of components sourced from the mire and gave the plans out to people in the Free States to make for themselves. But they kinda sort did that with the shrouded wood armor. 
---
Honestly the Free States kind of lost what made them unique and different the moment the bombs fell. Without a government to rebel against, without a society to live outside of, they are just better prepared survivors, but not much different from the usual wastelander.
---
Thats why I think in the future, they should bring back npcs and rebuild the factions. Then have the Enclave start dropping supplies for survivors and going on patrols to take out threats. Make the Enclave the "saviors" of Appalachia, but then have the Free States be suspicious and resist while the Responders, desperate for any aid, heavily side with the Enclave.
---
Really?
---
I swing through there all the time just to pick up extra colas. Maybe I need to start a side hustle 
---
For the love of all things holy atleast make the scrapper perk higer ranked for this purpose
---
You don't really need it but it makes it faster, you can use lockpick 3 and hacking 3 to bypass the fixing the reactor sequence 
---
True.  I think some players are going to do it no matter what.  Based on what I’ve seen there are two things that tend to push players who wouldn’t ordinary destroy things over the edge:
---
#1. Placing a lot of traps by the doors and locking things
---
#2. Putting a camp right at the backdoor of the whitespring golf club or in areas that directly interfere with other players.   
---
In my own case I’ve only destroyed camps due to #2.   I wouldn’t do it if it’s a lowbie trying to gain some XP but if it’s a high level player with rocket turrets, I go ahead and bring it down.  I can understand a low level player using the camp to help him kill things that are a threat, but a high level player doesn’t need the rocket turrets to farm there.  It’s overkill, it’s annoying, and it interferes.   I can’t think of any justification for a level 70+ doing it but I see it from time to time.  
---
At first, i thought it was dumb and pointless to charge for fast travel, then i realized, we need it. You know why your countries currency has value? Because it's the only thing you can use to pay taxes. 
---
Vendor prices a ridiculously high by design. So that we are the market. If we're not buying fuck all off the vendors, once you had the plans and mods and clothes you wanted, you'd never trade anything for caps ever again. The fast travel tax keeps you needing caps for as long as you play. And that gives the currency it's value.
---
Only if they sing the song.
---
&gt; I'm filthy screw rich on multiple characters. 
---
Man, that is a quality problem to have.  I can't find enough screws to build and mod a new rifle, let alone build and scrap rifles to learn its mods.
---
Charleston was ravaged by a flood when the cutthroat raiders mini nuked the Summersville dam on a Christmas day, post war.
---
I farmed for my gear, don’t be salty that you can’t get it brokeback. 
---
While that all sounds great, you'd further break the already broken pvp system. Tbh most of the time I get disconnects it's the whole server instance booting the lot of us.
---
new mode pvp    
---
terrible balances, and poor content 
---
 is the future of the fallout 76  and many objects for the atomic store 
---
I make the calibrated shocks for Excavator for my friends and I and they require 5 violet flux. I also don't play for long enough sessions to launch a nuke, fight the queen, and grab the violet flux. 
---
Good grief yes. I've got a bunch of duplicates from when I first started out and didn't really understand how to work them. BADLY needs delete and respec of cards. Heck I haven't even played since they issued the latest "update" but that might fix it for me if it gets implemented.
---
What kind of asshole downvotes a post like this? It's a pretty big issue with the game. 
---
We need this on consoles it's so time consuming to switch perks. Or just make crafting perks passive
---
I usually only play for about an hour, so that means someone else launched one in order for me to grab them. 
---
I see a lot of "You have to put too many points into weight reduction perks..."
---
No, you don't.  You CHOOSE to do that.  And by doing so, you CHOSE to sacrifice other things you wanted so you can carry more stuff. The only weight reduction perk I cannot live without as of right now is lvl 3 Thru Hiker. The food/water management in this game needs a bit of adjustment. My character eats more food in a 24 hour period than I do in real life, and they are in a post apocalyptic world where food is supposed to be scarce.
---
I choose to carry less garbage around with me. My stash is 400 lbs of junk, and 200 lbs for weapons/armor/ammo.  When that gets full, I sell off excess, or I reevaluate the weapons/armor I have saved and keep the best and sell/scrap the rest.
---
I am highly specialized in Rifleman build, so I only need to keep weapons for that build, and armor that helps that build.
---
This is a survival game, and part of that is sacrifice.
---
TL;DR of this is, the current points cap is fine. Learn to manage and survive on what you have.
---
If you're on XBox I can show you my secret spot.
---
Who says its about grinding? I hate grinding and I love just exploring. I have now been all over this map and feel like I know WV like the back of my hand now :) Still loving this game, just with they would correct some things that are just silly now....
---
ew
---
Honestly I'm not too sure, I've only encountered a handful and they all have fled. But I agree, introducing more than one type would be way more entertaining.
---
I started with a group of 5 friends playing the game; I am now the lone wanderer 
---
So could I completely respec all my points whenever, or only once?
---
The dam was hit by a mini-nuke courtesy of raiders.
---
If you check the map and nobody is anywhere near (and I mean like nobody on the entire golf course and then some) then you can go really early (like level 10 or less depending on your build) because the ghouls will spawn in at level 9. 
---
You'll still have to be able to tank hits from at least a half dozen ghouls at a time, but it's easily doable. Especially if you know the "safe" spots 
---
Yeah I snuck my way in this way, the person was there working at a bench. I wanted to scare them. Then I realized I trapped myself. 
---
The poor soul took pity on me and opened the doors for me. I could have teleported out but it was funny. 
---
Good times. 
---
I see. guess I'll have to take a look at that at some point.
---
&gt; take a look at the "known bugs" sticky and look at how long these bugs have been around. not little visual stuff, game breaking things like the SBQ sometimes flying off the edge of the map and never returning. Another big ongoing bug is that every single time I do queen runs, half the people cant pick up any loot.
---
Yea looking though the known issues around 1/4th are solved, 2/4th are set to be addressed in next patch and 1/4th they are looking into and will be addressed in a later patch.  Your example with SBQ isn't an easy fix because it only happens occasionally. Without knowing the specifics of what triggers it they can't reproduce it effectively in studio. Without that it means they have to literally dig though every line of SBQ code in hopes of finding the solution.  Some times simply attacking at the wrong time can cause a problem to develop in the code for the creature.  This would happen with Runescape some times. Bosses in particular that have multi phase stages if attacked with a certain attack at the right time it would interrupt the phase change allowing you to kill the boss at an easier stage. 
---
Jagex would be able to correct these issues in relatively short order specifically because players would be able to give them exact details of how to recreate it allowing them to replicate the problem easily and figure out how to adjust the game to compensate to prevent it from happening. 
---
&gt; look at what fallout 76 has to offer, the current "popular" fad is that people now figured out how to stack foundations because the game continues to be a buggy mess.
---
So? 
---
&gt; I cant even share any perks beyond a lv1 card because it glitches after a few seconds,
---
I've not experienced that issue. Will have to try it next time I'm on with my wife.
---
&gt;  and dont get me started on the radworms bug that makes marsupial(and many other things) stop working.
---
So why don't you take some disease cure to remove the disease? It doesn't effect mutations. 
---
&gt; stop being a blind fanboy, its downright embarrassing.
---
Ah so anyone who doesn't agree with you 100% is a blind fan boy. This isn't new and isn't unexpected but is always amusing to see. 
---
So therefore being able to rejoin would be great....right?
---
Sure it would probably teleport you to the nearest map location I.e. outside of a building or mine that you were in when booted....but just getting back to where you left has got to be a bonus
---
also "dont forget to share your content with us on socials with the hashtag #fallout76 !"
---
as if anyone in their right mind would be doing that now
---
I almost feel bad for complaining then lol cause that sounds like an amazing fight. My friends always say that one spawns next to my house but again I rarely see them. I rather like the turning pink ability too, kinda makes those Zetans seem more cheeky hahaha
---
I agree but if they implemented something like tgis I'd use it as a reason to start a new character. I enjoyed my first playthrough. I'm sure I'll enjoy doing it again.
---
Check OP's name. It's a trap.
---
r/copypasta much?
---
I'm getting an "oh, it's *you*" vibe from that light
---
Perhaps there is a spot you can hit on their backs or arms that disables the teleporter transponder? If that's the case that's amazing. I just never see them, that's mostly why I've posted this. 
---
teehee i claimed the munitions factory for well over three hours while i went around the map and did whatever, no crashes 
---
Yeahhhhh, about that.....  You see this "reduced 'weight' metric" bullshit that you and the other mental midget apparently think so highly of?  That still defies the fucking laws of physics.
---
It is not a bug.  They “nerfed” it if I recall correctly. 
---
ehh. i don't see any problem. there is no guaranteed loot in this game. 
---
No I mean it likely crashed in most cases. If it didn't i usually can use the social tab of recent players to rejoin my previous server. When the instance had crashed however; using this method completely crashes my game client. 
---
What damage bug?
---
need an auto eat queue system
---
You farmed the loot cave for 300 hours so you can jump straight up and down and not take any damage?
---
That's kind of sad.
---
I've 87 cores, I just can't put them down....
---
Lol! Almost every thing they gave us so far is used already in F4. It's just a computer that picks a few items a week from F4 an puts them into 76.
---
I throw large paintings on each side of the gas station sign and then write with the small letters on them.
---
Makes a good etch-a-sketch.
---
Oh, right. Yeah, I think I just confused the weightless pre-fix. Still, 50 percent is more than enough to get around that, and combat armor can be legendary. 
---
With constructor 2 it's only some nuclear waste, otherwise it's nuclear waste and aluminum. 
---
Explosive weapons heal enemies. So not only was damage cut by 70% when I can do damage it just heals them anyways.
---
In the game Defiance there are these miners called 99er's that remind me of the moleminers.  One of the bosses was named JackLeg Joe who used a mining drill to kill an npc. Good times.  Would like to see a mole miner major quest with a boss armed with a modified mining drill as a weapon.
---
For a year? Are you an idiot
---
The Wendigo.
---
Because it stands for greed, not just eating your fellow man. I'll see you all soon at the next buffet. 
---
its a trap... ;)
---
The mark of an advanced civilization, but no more is being made.
---
I got my caps not long after the email. I’d say within a week. 
---
When the game first came out there was glitches for exp everywhere. You could stand in place an lvl up 100s of times an hour from spamming the interact button on a trap.
---
Oh that stinks, does it affect legendary's with the explosive modifier as well as grenades? 
---
Yup because that’s what you do in RPG’s you farm for good gear. 
---
This song nails it.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGNdvKvbxYQ
---
Alas for TImothy.
---
It'd be nice if Scrapper were more like Super Duper in that regard.  At least give me a chance to get double the results from what I am scraping, rather than just a bit of extra steel or wood.
---
Solid
---
Maybe I would join your crew 
---
They are the source of all that toxic water no doubt.
---
i'm on pc, but thank you!  
---
It happens to enemies regardless of what they are. I made a post yesterday about it an Bethesda reached out about it. I've since forwarded my deatailed findings. I've been testing it on everything. It applies to a lvl 4 Mole Rat all the way to Scorchbeast. As for grenades I have no idea. It's mainly with guns with the explosive perk.
---
I'll PM it to you ;)
---
L2P
---
I vehemently support this. The lack of screws seriously stalls a lot of my upgrades and C.A.M.P. constructs. :(
---
I have like 300 screws stockpiled. After level 20 I’ve had no problems with screws or adhesive.
---
It's a song, I don't remember the name but it was The Ink Spots
---
I built right in Flatwoods next to the church... I've gotten more foot traffic here than anywhere else:

---
So after 50 you can move 1 point. Say you put too many points in to endurance and you wanted in luck then you could move 1 point there so you could have more perks
---
Nope never hapened to me in 400hours. Lear to play and stop downvoting lol guys.....
---
Two days ago was the first time ever I got a 3* item from the queen. Have 540+ hours in game an at least 60 kills on queen. Furious walking cane btw..
---
it would be cool if out of nowhere they just opened a vault in like the next week
---
The lever action take 10 whole screws... Scrapping give you none. That hurts alot
---
I think this is really the only way to solve the problem.  We need some button press combo that allows us to switch between minimum 3 different sets of skills without having to shuffle through cards to pick a lock.  Cards that I'm constantly shuffling in an out....and then forgetting to put my combat cards back in.....are Green Thumb, Lock Picking / Hacking cards (why the hell are there 3 individual cards?  except when you're leveling no one runs around with those cards active), Super Duper, Chemist, Ammosmith, cards for finding caps and magazines and probably a couple others I'm forgetting.  At a mimimum we should be able to instantly swap ALL of those in an once and then back out.  Possibly there could be one more shuffle button that lets us add in specialty combat cards for special situations like Glow Sight, Night Vision and others.

Having a button to insta-swap cards is just a duct tape fix for a poor design decision though.  I think that at level 50 we should gain the ability EITHER: pick a new perk, swap a SPECIAL point \_OR\_ start adding passive skills like lock picking up to a maximum of X passive skills (and combine lockpicking/hacking perk cards....another poor design decision that does nothing but frustrate people).
---
Rare? *Looking on 400screws in stash*
---
You don't play for 45 minutes? I don't sit down and play this game if I don't have 45 minutes lol.
---
I like the head changes, since that’s basically cosmetic as well, but the torso is... mixed. Depending on your chest it can be kind of cool though- sturdy/heavy BoS combat armor kind of works!
---
Just in case anyone else like me was initially confused by the unnecessary obliqueness of this post:
---
He's talking about Hello Games, who made No Man's Sky. 
---
The wasteland is a hard place, not everyone survives. 
---
Yes, it does
---
Honestly, I feel so sorry for you. I know how frustrating it is just to have the game crash, but when you’re in a silo, and have used just about all your ammo, I can only imagine your pain.
---
Uh... Sorry to burst your bubble, but the game is being given away for free. Here's a link to another article if you don't want to believe the video: 
---
https://www.gamebyte.com/stores-are-giving-away-fallout-76-for-free-in-terrible-bundles/
---
It's happening in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. A friend even sent me an image that a German friend of his sent him.
---
Also, last time I saw there were still duplication bugs that people could use for duplicate items... That sounds pretty game breaking to me. Also heard the AI gets constantly buggy on its path-finding, which not game breaking as it does not produce crashes, just sucks away all the fun when you constantly see enemies just staying still when you hit them. 
---
This is what I would like. Even have them be long term quests. Start with the safest area and only a certain section, so Sutton to Morgantown.  Once the repair the line quest has been done enough times the line is now clear. Then have a repair the train quest. That way it isn't just done and you will get to see it happen in game.
---
OOooOOOoooOOoooOooooo...
---
900 hours? That's more than ten hours a day, everyday. That's nearly 2 full time jobs.
---
In my experience it's cheaper to just scrap the broken armour and craft new pieces, assuming you have the plans for it. That in itself is pretty weird, and doesn't work if the armour piece happens to be legendary. 
---
max stealth is nothing compared to the power of the script !
---
It’s true. But we don’t have text chat or a player hub so making a player market is really hard. 
---
So, my Power Armor character takes 0 damage from sonic attacks. My nonPA takes 0 damage with: Fireproof only, Padded only,  Dense only, Fire+Pad, amd Fire+Dense.
---
I see no reason not to have 3 points into endurance for fireproof.
---
Im currently running a bloodied heavy weapons build with PA and fireproof with emergency protocols. I just stand still and wait for them to take a breath between sonic spams so i can see them shoot. 
---
Eeeeeh. Still not seeing it. By that reasoning you shouldn't be able to level up ever because you're rediculously strong compared to starting characters.
---
In all honesty the number of PERK points you can get and the number per SPECIAL is arbitrary. There isn't much you can't do with any basic build by simply swapping PERK cards out. Sure some super specific MIN/Max builds which rely on super specific stacks aren't available all over but that isn't really the problem.
---
Managing Perks and their card allocation isn't an attraction to me in this game. And it isn't like you lock in a character like the previous versions of the game. Just swap out the correct cards and suddenly your heavy is a melee. 
---
I haven’t ever purposely server hopped...seems like cheating to me.
---
I would like the same with apparel
---
Can we trade? I don't have 10k I have ammo
---
Did you not play 3? The subway was a huge part of getting around in that game.
---
This post is not about the game going f2p though. It's a news that the game is being given away for free in Germany, Austria and Switzerland when buying an used controller, or the Xbox + fallout 76 combo now including two copies of fallout 76 instead of one.
---
Bagholder spotted
---
Never server hopped. I've just played the game as I assume it was intended. Didn't even know server hopping was a thing until I saw it mentioned on in a YT vid. Hearing so many use that and use exploits is kind of disheartening. Oh well........
---
Fuck off dude
---
Agreed. Early in the game I avoided them like the plague. Admittedly I was visiting placed on the map where a level 5 had no business visiting; but I felt like most enemies that were too overpowered for me I could run away from and be okay.  Those mole miners, though...it felt like they just kept shuffling along after me forever.
---
Thats funny  😂    
---
Probably not as much of an idiot as you look like jumping straight up and down to exploit a cheat.
---
Again it sounds like you are playing Fortnite the easy mode. Maybe you can download an aim bot so that you don't have to aim while you're jumping straight up and down.... LOL.
---
We have them, put on the brotherhood scribe outfit I think it is. It adds like 120 pounds to your character.
---
550 hours? Thats unhealthy :/
---
Armor scales to weapon damage, if weapon damage = armor the weapon deals half damage, if the armor is 15% of the weapon's damage or less the weapon deals 99% damage, if the armor is ten times the damage of the weapon the weapon deals \~20% damage, if the armor is one hundred times the weapon damage you reach maximum dr of 91% reduced damage.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage\_Resistance](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance)
---
So to reduce the damage of a minigun (14) by half takes 14 armor, to reduce the damage of a super sledge (120) by half takes 120 armor, to reduce the damage of a bloodied psycho melee zerker's super sledge (4000) to something survivable with 600 health with raw armor takes &gt;100,000 armor.
---
Seems like he still hasn't read it.....
---
It’s never worked for me. I remember seeing them before I got xo1 but now I can never find them. Same as the jet pack. 
---
How about aluminum?
---
What was there to even nerf. I just want to explore the damn map without having to collect more water every thirty minutes because I have to drink eight bottles just to stay hydrated :(. 
---
Was looking for this.
---
You're wasting your time looking for those stupid shocks! I tried the hops but nothing. Just get a pair of T-60 legs and put shocks on them which are easy to find. Use the Legs on your X01.
---
Easy
---
I'll write it down and ask the Developers and get back to you
---
You must be a virgin. 
---
And it’s not a cheat don’t be mad you can’t kill me brokeback. 
---
Fool. Proof?
---
Im prerty sure Todd also said they absoluetly will support mods at some point
---
I think the community is just a crazed right now with all the problems, some real, most imaginary, coming from fo76.  
---
Folks weren't even able to get to the end of my comment to see the sarcasm so they weren't ever going to get to the end of your post and pick up on the joke.  I'm just holding out hope this won't devolve completely into the hate train over on /fallout.
---
Keep in mind, I'm trying to remember this off the top of my head, but I THINK you have to go back to the control room and there's a doorway in there that leads to the generators. I seem to recall running into the same problem and being lost forever. 
---
Good job buddy.
---
You're the best Grindr.
---
You don't know me...you don't know what I got...
---
Who needs that much purified water?  Even with thirst seemingly cranked up with the last patch my one small filter plus what I pick up playing is more than enough.  
---
There was also the Nirnroot thing ion Fallout 4. I thought it was a cool theory that Fallout and Skyrim were the same world at different parts of the timeline but Pete Hines put a bullet in that theory.
---
Holy Shit that's an awesome idea thanks
---
I've eaten my fair share of squirrel over the years. It's not bad! Goes well in a stew. 
---
Ore is relatively heavy and there is a surplus of Lead, Steel etc in junk you can just scrap.  I could see how there would be a need on some of the heavy weapons, but can feed most calibers with just junk.
---
Interested in the melee stuff since I lost my All Rise :( PSN:R-C-MAN
---
i don’t have but i do and i clearly frustrate players, especially the ones that don’t lock the reactor. my xbl account has a good handful of irate messages from this exact scenario. some players REALLY care.
---
I hope you’re not joking. I’m  ready to pay 20000 caps for this generator plan
---
The Wendigo feeling remorse and regret, now that's a Mysterious creatures indeed
---
Weird flex of knowledge but ok
---
Friends.  Play with friends.
---
Thanks friend, and I appreciate the irony of getting a friendly conversation by crying to a person called Crymour.  I hope you have a wonderful day.
---
I went back and read to make sure - what I said was that it allows me to slot in other perk cards - for example my AP is around 264ish so I don't need to slot in Action Girl - instead I can play with things like Mr. Sandman at night or 4 points of Adrenaline in the day. I hope I clarified what I meant for you. :)
---
Oh so, another game.breaking bug I forgot in my reply: weapons with the explosive perk heal enemies right now, something I read on this very own subreddit. That sounds pretty game breaking to me as well, especially for those that built around explosives. 
---
Steal his shoes and follow the yellow dotted line to the magical kingdom of Watoga!
---
Some data mining says that the Raider protective and shielded only have a high drop rate from the Raider Rose mission Signal strength, and they're level locked to higher level players, so if you're seeking those buy the two lower level Raider plans from vendors before doing that mission, and make sure you're at least minimum level for them (if I'm reading right it says level 17 but IDK if that's how you read the minimum level thing or if it's derived).
---
Otherwise the raider plans all have a chance of drop (a very low chance) from any recurring event in the Savage Divide. So, Uranium Fever, One Violent Night, Messenger, Distinguished Guests, etc... and a chance of drop from any event or quest on the entire map (a very very low chance there).
---
At least you don't have to individually swap out every card. It would be A LOT faster.
---
Dude ive got to lvl299 and i cba to start a new charcter tbh. I dont think repeating avarything i have done thus far will bring me any more enjoyment at this point. I feel aimless and just tend to wander around trying to find ANYTHING new that i havent found or events that i havent done.........there are none. I really think the only saving grace would be some new content e g very different events from what they have currently in game. 
---
Nope. That would make things easier and more fun, we can’t have that.
---
Why waste time powering up poseidon just build a generator to power the fusion core generator.
---
It's nerfed compared to FO4. I have 3 pp pies and had zero in FO4 and I tried a stupid amount of times in FO4.
---
If you're on PS4 I can give you a marsupial serum. Super duper proc'd while I was making serums for friends so I have an extra laying around 
---
I usually play in 30-1 hour sessions. Yeah, I'll do that if I absolutely need the flux. Either way it's a lot more effort than claiming an energy plant imo. 
---
Wait, the flags have ballistic fiber?
---
I'd love to see the vendor situation completely retooled. especially since some plans are so damn expensive.  It makes absolutely no sense that vendors of the same group are tied together despite being a mile apart and I suspect it really confuses the newbies too.  The only kind of person who would think that's a good idea is a developer whose prerogative is to stymie progression at any cost.
---
There's a disturbing amount of parallels between this game and star citizen.
---
-Developer starts a weekly "insider" press release in lieu of actual updates
---
-"I don't mind waiting for the next patch, the longer they take the better it'll be"
---
-Players speculating that maybe there's a big treasure-trove of new content right around the corner
---
-Increasing number of posts on the subreddit are just fantasizing about how eventually the game might have all kinds of new features that would make it a totally different, better game
---
Well Hello! I'm kind of a youngish Granny at 50 so I'm not at your level of Awesomeness yet! You're Amazing!!
---
&gt;  It's one of the things I enjoy about the game in that no two players  have the same play style, yet they can both enjoy the game. 
---
Let me tell you, they way you're playing is going to be considerably more enjoyable than grinding through to reach lv 50 as fast as you can and burning through the main story. Those are the people complaining mostly here, they make a lot  
---
That's probably what I'll do. I was able to find some nice other X-01 mods.
---
To make the game as grindy as possible doe the least amount of effort possible, so that you sjdnt realise how little content there really was.
---
Ah man, I'd love to launch mini nukes at Pierre and JoJo Mart.
---
I didn’t preorder it. Just grabbed it on sale a few weeks ago. Like I said I was playing it casually. In 3 and new Vegas it was very easy to tailor your character to your liking with the much better skill system 
---
Its not suppose to be an exchange though. There doesn't need to be balance in a situation like this.
---
Found it, thanks!
---
+1 ...  I’m usually swapping my cards as I’m getting cooked by a scorchbeast ... alas would love to quick swap between craft mode vs battle or farming ...  would make the game much richer ..  
---
Oh fuck. I guess I didn’t have to make a new character. Thanks
---
Seriously!!! Idk how this hasn’t ever been addressed when it’s been an issue since day 1.
---
Yes, yes.  It's just me, of course.  "... there is more to consider than just weight in the real world."  Then there's this gem of false equivalency: "This is why we carry items inside in grocery bags and the reason a 45lb weight is easier to carry than 45lbs of toilet paper."  "the simplest fix would be to to have bulked items represented as a significantly reduced weight" &lt;--- probably just an oversight, but yeah this is called "magic" aka "a decreased “weight” metric" aka ye old D&amp;D Bag of Holding.
---
You want me to go on?
---
Look, I get it.  We need to be able to carry / store more stuff, but can't we just increase the STASH size and decrease the amount stuff weighs without 'fixing' problems with duct tape like this "solution" represents?
---
I really could less about the mechanics of bulking, but there's already enough illogical BS in this game like the weight of bobby pins and heavier grain bullets doing less damage.  For me I only bulk because it makes selling my leftovers easier.  I can sell 4 bulked stacks of screws easier than I can maneuver that quantity box to some precise number of screws that I want to sell.
---
Agreed. It would be cool if this was part of some kind of "expanding the frontier" quest line, and it would even follow logically from the game's basic premise. 
---
Give one of them a massive drill. Underminer or riot. 
---
Yes me too but adding T60 with calibrated shocks to my X-01 was just awesome!
---
Yeah but I never all in’d one stat on those games so I never actually got 11
---
Yes please. I lost 12 Stable Flux yesterday after my modem crashed at the wrong time, lagging out in the middle of a fight then completely DCing before I could get my dropped junk back. Sadface. .\_.
---
Had my X01 classy just disappear.  Fortunately all my X01 armor was in my inventory.
---
Had to find another classy to throw it all on.
---
There is an hourly cap on the amount of water an area can produce, It's \~30 if I remember correctly, if you build more purifiers, and take all of the water out you end up having to wait, the advantage from having multiple is to have more storage to fill up when you aren't there for a long period.
---
I am south of Wataga and I get displaced a lot so must be a popular spot.  It is the crossing point to get back from queen fights and near water and two vendors.  Whitesprings train station is good because is outside of blast zone for a nuked whitesprings. Vault 76 (fast travel point) is a popular spot, and outside the golf club at whitesprings probably has the highest population of players, but you would need to server hop when its nuked.
---
Never seen that happen, 
---
Were you in pacifist mode at the time?
---
Was another player killed in the explosion?
---
Was someone's camp or a workshop damaged?
---
lmao
---
If MODUS had all the mods then server hopping wouldn't be necessary. Play your game how you wish. If you're playing and get disconnected and login to a new world, you just server hopped. Is that cheating then?
---
Or you could slot in the Very Underrated Radicool for one hot perk point in Endurance for more Strength 
---
Lmao solid troll
---
this seems more like a how-to guide for the glitch than a “fix this glitch” type of post
---
Grats. It took me about 15 minutes out of the vault. I think most of the toxic players are gone now.
---
I don't mind grinding..started a new character ran to whitespring Harper's watoga as quick as possible..he has a hunting rifle modded and is f***ing sh** up currently level 13
---
Screws are in desk fans, toy cars and trucks, silver lockets, and typewriters.
---
Sugar Grove has a bunch of fans and globes. Server hop if you don't see any.
---
Charleston Herald has typewriters and fans.
---
Tyler County Fairgrounds has a booth with toy trucks and cars.
---
Charleston Courthouse, as soon as you go in turn left, then unlock the employees only door. There are two typewriters in there. There should be more typewriters and fans but it gets looted a lot.
---
If someone nukes fissure prime, walk around the fissure. There's usually a dead megasloth with screws. 
---
I would prefer that they leave it at 50; and then each free DLC of significance would increase the cap by 1; with no specific promise that this would continue forever. That way they could slowly track the impact while still giving more to the players over time.
---
The t60 legs are cheap to repair! I did that with my t51 set too.
---
Was that the plans or is there also a mod?
---
Could I please also learn of your secret screw oasis?
---
When you get there, there's some rocks that kind of tower above everything on the edge of the cliff.  You'll have to climb to the top of these and you should find three corpses laying near the edge, along with three dynamite plungers.  Also, there's a bobblehead spawn down near the house. You have to go into the outhouse and then look down into the hole.
---
I tried it and it works. You have to look around a bit for the bag but it will be there. If you don’t see it at first just keep looking
---
Have a schedule for the train. It stops every 5 minutes or so. Maybe have events to defend the train as its traveling or something.
---

---
Pretty sure he’s just trying to troll people into losing their junk
---
This reminds me  of how fast travel used to work in WoW. 
---
You could go to a Flightmaster and pay some gold to ride a flying mount "on rails" to another Flightmaster, but only if you first had discovered both the starting point, the destination and most of the waypoints inbetween. (they later changed this to unlocking the waypoints as you levelled)
---
However, you wouldn't just teleport from one point to the other, you would actually sit on the "taxi" while it flew. 
---
Sure, it could take a while to cross a continent, but at the same time you could either sit and enjoy the scenery or go and get yourself some tea. 
---
I would really like it if there were Protectron-driven "battle trains" rolling between the railroad stations that we could ride, kind of like the horsecarts in Skyrim, except we would actually ride along on the actual train rather than just pay caps and get immediately deposited at the destination. 
---
Outside of that, fast travel could work like it does now, except you pay to ride the tran and not to "teleport". You want to go explore in a different region, but don't want to walk there? Pay up! And then you still have to unlock all the other non-railroad waypoints by walking to them. 
---
It’s ridiculous. Why are there so many duplication glitches in this game.
---
I am also on XBox and admittedly I am a Lone Wanderer most of the time - if you see me though, come say Hi and we'll see what fun we can rustle up :)
---
I know of it... and I really wish it didn't. :\\
---
I don't know, I used to use heavy weapons on the queen in the air and switched to a melee profile when she landed. Certainly not the fastest, but fast enough.
---
Sure, Luck of the Draw and Lucky Break do mitigate this. But still this sin'r normal when you are given a choice -  either you use all those perks or spend an hour every day grinding for repair components. Not to mention managing your stash all the time
---
Who knows? It might have gotten downvoted for violating rule #6 - Use descriptive titles. 
---
Maybe they just quit on the game. Time to open it up to modders so they can fix it for them.
---
There’s a plan and mod but you can also find them if you’re patient. Not as much patience is required to find mods as it is for X-01 calibrated shocks 🤗
---
Im staying and still enjoying the wasteland!
---
I don't know too much about Melee builds but I think the Brawling is a Mod for regular armor arms? Anyone know?
---
I feel like a fair few complaints on here have been due to a need to make trading between players easier. Some way of doing it without having to stop playing and post on the bazaar or Facebook. I personally love the idea of buildable beacons in workshops.
---
People complain about wanting to make use of the missiles they don’t want, I’d love to take them off their hands for a reasonable price. Hell I’d give them the springs I’d otherwise sink into crafting explosives. So it’s clear what we all need to be able to do quickly and easily...
---
LET’S MAKE A DEAL!
---
Instructions unclear - built base over fissure with sign saying "Free Candy Inside"
---
What platform you on?
---
Search for it on Twitter. You'll find what I'm talking about. It's a shame.
---
Gotta Crawl before you can Walk dear :)
---
I believe we are missing a piece of the puzzle. Something doesn't add up about not being able to sell or break down ammo and screws don't come from scrapping things? Either Zenimax had an idea to monetize ammo and screws, or they planned on using them as currency between player trades and never implemented a system to facilitate such trade. I don't know, but it doesn't seem like it would harm the online mechanics of fo76 like I write most of the other issues off to.
---
"Next week we are rolling out a patch that fixes over 100 bugs. On top of that, you'll get to experience brand new bugs that we guarantee to fix in the upcoming months!"

reminds me of the early days of MMOs when people in chat would ask how to improve their FPS.  Invariably the response would be to hit ALT-F4.   5 minutes later the newb would log back in and call everyone a dick.  
---
I’m on ps4
---
I've done the queen with a 20-30% build, have to use maybe 5 stimpaks max because all of the adds and heavy fire is annoying.
---
I use Fireproof Blocker as only defensive perks, I add Serendipity too because of nature of my build. Add a Protocol-ed mod to your PA torso and you're at an "effective" 75% health when at 20. It's not too bad I guess
---
Unfortunately no, I bought it on the computer but couldn’t get it to run at all.
---
I hate server hopping. I spent such a ridiculous amount of time in and out for stupid stuff. I tried a little bit of hopping for x01 shocks. I'm glad plans don't need hopping anymore. There are a lot of plans useful while levelling to 50 that aren't particularly useful after that are hard to find without it. It's ridiculously hard to find tomahawk plans and if you ever do they're garbage once you have them.
---
Is this what the sub has become?.
---
Where are all the cool pics , stories and gameplay stuff. :(
---
I am not on PC so that must have been another awesome survivor
---
Yeah. I was able to get some other cool mods and in some cases there were some nice legendary weapons and armor. I got a nice two-shot light machine gun and another weightless armor piece to add to my collection for those times when I don't use the PA.

2 hours for gatling gun plan

The whole point of the build is that I almost never repair anything, and I still do great damage.  Its one of 6 chars i have made.  At the moment, it is the most fun to run around with.  I have given up on needing 50 tons of bs, so she just runs around having fun only keeping the best of the best.
---
I will check out tonight 
---
Mathematically you are missing out on 15% more xp by playing solo since there is no inspirational. Let's assume every level after 50 requires the same xp; you have gained 650 levels since then. Well someone running inspirational 3 would have 15% more xp therefore their level would be about 15% higher. (650 x 1.15 = 747 levels earned after level 50.
---
So, while you got to 700, someone doing the same in a group could be at 797 potentially.
---
Having said that, yeah those people exploited 99% of the time 
---
Then they need to remove the cost of repair. Or give an incredibly serious penalty to the culprit. The main problem is bad people going around throwing orbital strike beacons on people's camps for no reason. It's just unhealthy for the game. 
---
yep ! prostatitis
---
Yes in pacifist mode. Someone's workshop damaged. I was literally there for the public event to help them defend it. Dozens of monsters crowding around a vehicle and it just blows up. Stupid af how that should flag you for HELPING THEM

Selling excess water turns a healthy little profit.
---
Yeah, I notice comparisons to No Man's Sky as well.  I'm all for games getting better, like NMS or Rainbow Six Siege have.  But they aren't doing much to inspire confidence at the moment.
---
A trade-in system for "undesired" perks to potentially get a perk I want would be nice.  If there's a concern about "balance", then it could be 2-for-1 or 3-for-1.  
---
But it sucks to open up a pack every 5 levels and either get cards I really can't use in multiples (e.g., Ammosmith when I already have Ammosmith at 2) or just not very desirable.
---
Hi all, this is my first post here on this sub, i just started playing recently, and in fact i was coming here to day to post just his thing!
---
i have been lucky enough to some power armor frames, and am keeping the pieces or armor on them, but in my inventory they just seem to be empty shells, it is very confusing.
---
is there no way to tell them apart in my inventory? 
---
Wow. MVP right here. Also... Why does it say it can produce 60 then if it is actually 30? Wtf lol
---
PS4
---
About the 10th time I server hopped I couldn't move when I logged in. I could open the map and fast travel but wherever I went I still couldn't move or open the pipboy. So I went to my camp and it was being attacked by a scorchbeast and I could do nothing haha. 
---
It's needed for basically everything. Drinking, making chems, making foods....
---
Whatever it's called, needs changing 
---
I don't get why everyone cares so much. With travel agent I have never once been hurt by the cost of fast travel. I find caps to be mostly useless in FO76, once i get to around 5 grand I buy a bunch of plans to bring my total under 1 grand just for the fuck of it. But I have never needed caps in this game.
---
Landfill or Horse, please make your mind up!
---
I heard if you throw a piece of Sentinel/Cavalier armor in a fissure it will give you a full set back and make you insta good at PvP.
---
It would, but I'm sure it would be broken.  :(

Actually, from my perspective at least, there is a ton of content to be explored. I just wish I had time to explore it instead of hunting for crafting materials.
---
After 15 hops for x01 shocks I posted on bazaar, after 30 more I got a message about them, didn't hear back then 30 more hops and I got someone to sell me shocks. I don't hop anymore now lol

Specifically, let us get screws from scrapping weapons when using the perk "scrapper". This perk in fo4 didnt just give you more wood and steel but also allowed you to scrap better materials from weapons.
---
That sounds consistent with what I've seen.
---
Because, like Op, I tried doing a water CAMP once and ran into the same problem where it seemed like nothing was producing water while I was there, and I'd only get 0 or 2 at each purifier if I left and came back.  Either way, it's a far cry from the "60/hr" the description suggests.  I suspected there was some CAMP-wide limit.  The description of the purifier is just plain wrong.
---
You could nuke the queen and collect a bunch of violet there though. So nuking the bog and not hitting fissure prime is a waste of time IMO.
---
It produces one a minute, until the water runs out.
---
Obtuse for no particular reason, as all things should be, no wait.

Can I have both padded and dense?
---
Where do I even find plans for padded or dense armor?

I will definitely get fireproof now that I know this lol

Maybe make the frames a part of the build pack? So a metal frame with the warehouse build set etc.

They have that when doing the Mistress of Mystery quest you can go directly to the underground base using the tubes outside.

I'm on a fourth and well I've noticed an issue across the higher level players. I am in 7 different fo76 Discords and run one of my own, and I have seen a large number of high-level players burning out to play other games. Most of them are talking about how they will return when there is content, and that after 150 levels they are out of things to do. To help curb my burnout (and I do feel it at times).
---
I started playing a No Armor or Resistance Berserker build. It keeps me on my toes as everything is dangerous. The problem is at level 22 my weapons are becoming less and less effective while the enemies damage has scaled up. This makes it hard to grind more xp without people carrying me through a Whitesprings run (which is not the way I want to level this character). 
---
TL/DR: I am trying to keep things fresh, new, and difficult for myself and that helps keep the motivation.
---
That's true, but I tried playing without them on my Max strength build and I felt like I had one pocket that could for a single spring in it. 
---
XB1. I found the plans from Phoenix. They were about 3500. A little less if I use grape mentats. I have Hard Bargain 3 but my Charisma is 6. 
---
I hadn't made the connection that the entire cave was an Easter Egg, it's been so many decades since I played Colossal Caves. But I definitely recognized the word the blocks spelled out at the end. It was a clue you got early in the game, and didn't solve until much later.
---
That may be the first game I every made a detailed map of, so I didn't waste even one step in the maze. Eventually I got the highest score you can get by completing it still holding the spare flashlight battery and putting it in the display case.
---
Well, while I do not consider current special system a flawless one, I do consider it vastly superior to previous iterations, and I'm observing those last twenty years.
---
Its okay to play games casually, but its also absolutely correct that minmaxed optimised calculated and designed builds are more effective than those casually sewn together without any prior research.
---
This is a survival wasteland game. It should award being prepared and cautious. It does so. It shouldn't award thoughtless not giving a damn. It doesnt. I'm fine with people who say they want to play casually, but I consider their attempts of providing thoughtless balance advices to a system they haven't bothered to research as kinda pathetic, especially as its often coupled with calling the product and its authors dumb. Its rarely 'I enjoyed the previous system more', its usually 'the new one sucks', and the truth is the vast majority of those comments come from people who not only suck themselves but are also blissfully unaware of that fact.
---
That'll fix it. ^
---
I can understand where your coming from, but in a game with almost no end game.   I had WAY more fun making my 6 chars \~level 60 then I think I would have trying to get one guy to level 200.  So for me it was easy to delete and try again.  I am just pissed that we can only have 5 chars.  I have not made a heavy, energy, or team medic yet. 
---
Its 2019, wr have them just not in game
---
Wow
---
I knew of Filthy but thanks for the other three Fly. Our sub group here used to be like these subs as well. Was my favourite bit of my morning coffee.
---
Some say I'm still out there server hopping somewhere.
---
What do you have of sentinel and cavalier?
---
I know there's some hanging bodies at Cliffwatch, just southwest of Top of the World
---
Dude how?
---
I pick up *everything* I see and I never have enough to repair all my stuff.
---
My god what a dumb idea this is. 
---
I don’t care “when” in as much as I care about the quality of the next patch. I can wait two weeks or more as long as the patch fixes most of the main issues. Make sure it is tested
---
Nah, I'm not talking about some games that you are only investing hours into.. but years. Medievia and EvE Online. After you have invested a few years then you have the choice to go into certain zones for NPK (you only lose exp and have to respawn) or zones that are CPK and when you die your character can be stripped of everything you have on it at that time. The benefit is super high exp, amazing loot, ect ect the best things in the game are in those areas and can be sold for high prices on the market. But, it's a risk that most people aren't willing to take. If this was implemented, I can see it being beneficial to certain raid zones if that ever happens, but as FO76 is right now.. it can barely stay love for an hour at most before the servers crash. So, this game is on the mend and hopefully they fix the core before they explore into other options. 
---
I repeat it though, lore or not.. if this happened in real life you better believe if you have been a doomsday prepper and my kid needed to eat and you wouldn't share, you wouldn't wake up the next morning just because this is our root of our family survival instincts. Just saying.
---
Ya expensive! That’s why I’m trying to find some first
---
Holding breath while aiming in PA drastically drains power core. Tested by two different players. Have 190 action point, holding breath until I can ont anymore drains 10% of my core. Mate with 180 loses 9%.
---
Crits happens about 50% less often that pre patch (all crit-related perks maxed out and selected). 
---
I hid Forbidden Knowledge and after the last patch it no longer triggers and I cannot reactivate it.  
---
Thanks for the downvote now my life is complete :)
---
You cant make food with it
---
Maybe you wouldn't get downvoted if you didn't accuse someone of hoaxing while be wrong?
---
Me too. Send me a friend request. Psn: R-C-Man
---
I’m a bloodied melee + rifleman secondary build at 15 strength (with max barbarian and blocker for mitigation), 6 perception (the 3 rifleman perks at level 1 and max level tank killer), 4 endurance (max fireproof and radicool), 1 charisma (tenderizer solo, strange in numbers when in party), 8 intelligence (max nerd rage and demolition expert), 11 agility (max dodgy and evasive for mitigation), and 11 luck (max serendipity for chance to ignore damage) yea I so went the more balanced route instead of max stack on agility like everyone else.
---
The 75% isn’t armor it’s a static reduction. It’s not changed by AA at all, Plus AAE currently doesn’t work. Anyone who is smart is running Dense + Fire proof as well. But gamma gun and melee always work 
---
Thanks for the clarification.  That post made my head hurt 
---
It was a rare spawn at Watoga BoS vendor and I kept getting very unlucky.
---
`"Fully dynamic world"`
---
Aww I wanted to see the troll and it got removed =[
---
Someone just has to take the next two steps for it to be perfect.
---
1.) Make it a single button combo without using the menu to swap.
---
2.) Make it swap automatically based on context, such as equiping shotgun perks when I pull out my shotgun and rifle perks when I swap to the rifle.
---
Don't know why you were downvoted, the video shows where the plans spawn... those display cases in Harper's Ferry are the same place I found mine. I haven't ever found marine plans on the vendor though (I've found mod plans, not the base plans).
---
FBI wants to know your location
---
Same place :)

I had a group of 7, then it turned to 4 within the month, then it was me and one other friend in the second, and now... 
---
Half the time I go there, there's a Scorchbeast flapping around. The Trading post would need Anti-Aircraft turrets if you put it there.
---
Just play metro. The economy is literally bullets.
---
"Do I want to upgrade my gun. I have 60 bullets for my sniper, and it costs 40 bullets to upgrade my sight, but what if I need those bullets, but what if I need this sight."
---
That would be epic honestly. 
---
I had a ton but all gone sorry. I’ll see what I have running some unyielding right now plus others 
---
Oh fck.
---
I get 4 to 6 everytime i return to camp. I know its why I have hundreds of springs screws and gears
---
My base is an aluminum farm, so I have lots now. I know that's always in need. 
---
I have 1 zealots girded leather arm and my armors ressistance is around 250 of all types except poison and rad (150)
---
Idk if its a bug but scorchbeast attacks do little to no damage to me. 
---
Omg it worked!! Ty!!! 
---
I would also love to see a roadmap. Without one time between each update is full of inaccurate speculations and the player base grows more and more angry.
---
I did it for like 4 hours one night getting really drunk. Rage posted here and got (rightfully) down voted to hell.
---
Next day, got my shocks within ten minutes...
---
Public Workshops, when owned by another player can be very tricky to help defend without becoming wanted.
---
Even when teamed with the owner you can still sometimes become wanted for damaging something (including junk, or other static objects in the area), it's best to use melee weapons when helping to defend.
---
What time will you be online? 
---
My motivation is that I still need achievments from quests I completed in the beta, and atoms from discovering places I discovered in the beta - since all of that is now impossible on my main.
---
you can if you boil it
---
I’ve suggested a few times to make a Powering Up type of event for train stations. Something where you repair the rails/station/engines then it either gives you a discount in that region or lets you fast travel for free. 
---
If you have the scrapper perk, it seems only reasonable to recover a 1-3 screws from a gun that took 30 to make and mod.
---
Im on xbox and i can't get the quest,  the missing link, to progress.  Ive tried looking online for help but they say the key for the door on the ski lodge is under the mat but it has never shown up. Ive been doing this for days and i can't keep doing this. Is there something im missing i have searched this area a hundred times already.
---
I love how the camps look with the low level of lighting. My camp is always lit up like a Bangkok whore house.
---
I'll send one when I get out of work I won't be playing for like another 10hrs. Unless I can do it with the app (And yeah I know I should be working not posting on reddit)
---
Online now for next few hours.
---
But i am not wrong, show me video otherwise. Same as bans for crafting 20items, stealing by trade, pacifist insta kill,.......

People who dont understand game mechanics making post like this and spreading lies are bad, not me lol

Not only are you not alone but I think I am Bethesda's Bitch... :P

I killed the lvl 50 that had been following me all day only to have a lvl 65 show up right behind her!! Tell me someone isnt watching me....
---
Hell all I ever find are the vengeful mothmen 
---
Lol yeah that's exactly what I'm thinking except you worded it much better.
---
No, you cant. Purified water has no use for cooking.
---
I was kind of thinking of that after I hit send, I have only done the intro part to that quest line and have used it only once. But it is very cool. 
---
You could nuke her but queen fights tend to be buggy with infinte loading loot tables =[ and red piles in the red ground are hard to find.
---
Or, they can make changes so this doesn't happen. Doesn't that make a lot more sense? Why should we have to suffer because it is a very flawed mechanic? your comments are very strange and it seems like you're trying to blame people for being affected by these mechanics that are very poorly thought out 
---
This has a very different impact on the game. I never managed to trade with people I encountered in game for lack of in game support. I trade with people via Discord and we just agree, gather, trade, say bye. It's not exactly immersive. 
---
I'm not home till roughly 5pm (est)   so I couldn't help till around then but hopefully someone who is online right now can help
---
Hah. Please, do NOT hold your breath. 
---
Is it right after you interact with your camp by chance ? Mine was booting me every time I put it down and crafted something. Like clock work id be kicked ever time . Try re making your camp and placing it somewhere else. It’s worth the shot 
---
I can put it on your weapon.
---
Ahahah! XD
---
My friends absolutely hated Fallout 76 so I am alone since day one. Kinda hate how the game is made to be played in group.
---
Lol me too
---
What does that have to do with OP picking flowers though? His method guarantees no queen loot, at least this way you get a chance at some lol
---
Sent from app
---
My God what a dumb comment this is. No effort at all to discuss or explain why they disagree. Just an insult. So dumb
---
Yeah, I get both points. This game is full of random things that do and dont make sense (but more the latter). Like a sledgehammer with a rocket on it, that weighs next to nothing because it is "legendary" and has 90% reduced weight. And how we can "carry" a robot suit and a 300lb minigun. It just seems like if we can do stuff like that, then spending a resource to make certain bulked stuff weigh less doesnt seem too far out of the realm of possibility for this game. Even if it doesnt "make sense" according to the Law of Conservation of Mass. 
---
Sorry boy, they are offering psycho for being rat.
---
they recently nerfed the 2-shot legendary prefix to only provide a +25% damage bonus
---
Bro. Relax. It's a game. You know? Make believe? Have you ever been laid? You should go get laid.
---
Yup added you from my app
---
social tab doesnt let us rejoin on pc sadly..and when you crash on pc..the social tab is usually blank
---
Here we go, I've created a fix for this in line with Bethesda standards
---
https://imgur.com/a/oHKRCBt
---
I actually did have a duplication glitch of my base camp.  Somehow I wound up with four copies of my base and like 394% over budget. Let me tell you, it takes a lot of time scrapping piece after piece to get under 100%. 
---
I didn’t have any turrets. The biggest budget busters were blinking lights. The plus side I that my generators were also duplicated so I can power a bunch of water purifiers.  Until I learn the plans for something else needing power. 
---
I honestly wouldn't mind that. Unofficial Fallout 76 Patch/Fallout 76 Anti Crash/ENB's and Texture Packs, content from other Fallout games ported over, the possibilities are endless.
---
I was born in 1984 and have never heard of the game until recently.
---
Actually embarrassing for me ;-)
---
At first, I also had only the lantern and the word in mind. During my research I stumbled over many passages of the game and the similarities can not be a coincidence.
---
Do I really need a rebuttal to "pvp bad uwu :'("?
---
Aw it looks like you spooked him. 
---
So you're good with a 2020 update as long as every bug is fixed?
---
False
---
The game is not worth playing for my friends and I are anymore until some sort of group dungeon comes out.
---
If i get wanted by accident.. I go look for other players CAMPs. And shoot it to pieces to increase my wanted level. 
---
I personally hunt people down with Voice on and then stalk them for the human interaction, and by interaction I mean listening to their voice(I wear a sack hood and wild man rags).  Sometimes PVP a little for the heck of getting called a hacker when people do not realizer Bloodied Explosive still performs well.
---
Isn't that incredibly dumb? You can use boiled water, but you can't boil purified water, and you can't use it for cooking. You literally have to get dirty water out of the ground and boil it over a fire instead of using purified
---
Be careful though.  Even when a slight mention of poor game experience in filthy casuals you’ll get yelled at and downvoted. 
---
That kind of thinking is what's lead to patches that create more bugs.
---
&gt; The only ores worth your acid is Lead Ore. 
---
Ultracite?
---
Almost any house will have a children’s bedroom with toys/screws, home office with a typewriter or desk fan, and on rare occasion a pepper mill in kitchens that has two whole screws. You may only come out of a house with 2-3, but establishing some decent routes can let you gain quite a few. 
---
I find these days that the easiest way to gain a ton is just to know what items contain them and then play the game. Do quests, random travels, etc. and you should come up with plenty after visiting several locations without having to farm separately.
---
If trying to find tons of screws to craft weapons for mods you will have problems, at that point I would just set up CAMP over a junk extractor or take one of the workshops with junk piles. If you can spare the caps even buying them from vendors saves a lot of headache.
---
Jeez easy on the down votes people it’s what i do when I’m under attack lol I don’t do it I avoid as much people as possible in this game 
---
That only makes you lose more money. 
---
Whats' the point of having multiple character if one can do it all...
---
Well shit. Looks like I am gonna have to make a new character because I wanted to go for a survival/gun build, but the build I made on NukesDragons has VASTLY different stats.
---
I get them to show up 1/20 times.  I found two over time, then while crafting my x01 set I accidentally super-duper'd the left leg.  then proceeded to calibrate two left legs.  had to go back and server hop.  sold the duplicate left leg.  found another shock as someone else went to modus right after me.  I guess he bought my calibrated extra left leg, proceeded to try to trade with me for my newly modded right leg.  It was a tad comical.   They're not that rare.. well they should be that rare.  I managed to trigger the joystick control lockout bug SEVERAL times while server hopping too.  So that's another fun anecdote.
---
I like to restart when I figure out a way to do what I want to do better and faster, or maybe I missed something or didn't get to do something the way I wanted. I have restarted four or five times and it is fun each time to do things better. I figure that's just how I'm wired. I can totally see not wanting to grind everything again but honestly I live for the grind.
---
Yeah but higher wanted level will draw players
---
I get lost all the time on that shit, I make sure to completely repair each area so the extra waypoints and highlights go away on my map.
---
We are looking into a lot of different things with Queen and Scorchbeasts in general, currently. This feedback helps a lot with that!
---
About 25 years is at least one generation.
---
&gt; Make sure it is tested
---
Yeah, I'm sure they'll do that.... Look at the last few patches and tell me they test them before releasing.
---
The game shouldn’t be crashing. No one should play this game. Doesn’t even pain me to say, I love fallout but this isn’t fallout: its a reskin with 0 logic in the story. That’s not fallout.
---
Check your nat settings, I know that causes issues with other games 
---
Perk card loadouts
---
Dude I know your pain my main has like 5 events he can't do because of that, haven't done Jack Pumpkin House in two months or so.
---
I could just as easily claim anyone defending the game is a Bethesda shill who hasn't played it either, and is just doing it out of brand loyalty, and I'd have just as much evidence of that as you do for your claim.
---
they are. and I should know, played well over 700 hours.
---
I have this mutation and have no issue with Watoga bots after the Mayor for a Day mission.
---
Ya deciding builds is a pain. I think there are a few  I  am working on. Main character is a melee build. 2nd is a sneak shotgun rifle build and the 3rd will be unarmed sneak 
---
yes for sure. if the game client crashes on XBONE it also becomes blank. So hard crashes are criminal.  I can see why it doesn't work on PC to join, because the social tab, brings up the xbox player menu so that you can see their xbox profile.  From THERE you "join game" option. I still say that any rejoin option has to take PVP into account.  Anyone who can remember playing Halo2 back in the day will recall people doing wonky stuff with their routers/network connections to cheat the game syncronization.  
---
I found one with bonus limb damage, but in Vats it only shoots torso regardless of limb selection.
---
We ran up to him in excitement and he did not like that. We tried to hang out with him for a good 10 minutes. Eventually he perished... 😢
---
I'm on PC but I appreciate the offer. :)
---
Not only are they NOT going to remove it, they're going to double down with an entire new version CENTERED around it!
---
if you look at this sub's subscriber count, it is going down almost daily. It was over 171k yesterday or the day before, now it's barely over 170k. Not saying it's major, but a steady decline.
---
Platform? PC for me, seems as busy as ever, and seeing a lot of lower levelled players too. 
---
Lol just fifteen times? I’ve spent a solid eight hours doing nothing but server hopping for enclave vendor and not seen calibrated shocks or jet pack. All together I’ve spent close to twenty hours hopping just for that vendor. Good luck 
---
I love the blue wave attack they do. Very cool enemy. 
---
You know, sitting here and crunching the numbers, 76 almost feels like it makes more sense than 50 for this game...
---
Hear me out!
---
Older Fallout games, besides Fallout 4, gave you 40 points to allocate to your SPECIAL stats. Meaning you could average all your stats across the board at 5-6 for each stat. Fallout 4 was an exception, giving you only 28 points to work with (So an average of 4 per SPECIAL stat) due infinite leveling bring introduced. It allowed you to continually boost your SPECIAL stats until they were maxed out. These games also had two other MAJOR factors:
---
1. SPECIAL stats capped at 10 in terms of point investment (You could technically go past 10 with meds/equipment, but only Fallout 4 saw benefit from that.)
---
2. There were far less perks with "multiple ranks," meaning you didn't need to spend 3-5 perk points to make a perk feel worth it.
---
Conversely, in Fallout 76:
---
1. SPECIAL stats are capped at 15 in terms of what you can invest, and can go all the way to 30 through other effects!
---
2. There are MANY perks, with most having several ranks.
---
In Fallout 3's base game, you had a total of 19  points (Level cap was 20) you could invest in perks, and 85 total points to choose from (Intense Training, which is an option we don't have in Fallout 76, contributed 10 points alone, and could provide 10 more SPECIAL points.)
---
Fallout: New Vegas gave you 15 points (Level cap was 30 in the base game), and had a total of 101 points to choose from (And again, "Intense Training" was 10 of those). 
---
Fallout 4 had no limit to perk points due to the leveling up system, but also introduced every perm having multiple ranks instead of a wider option of perks.
---
Fallout 76 hybridizes the two systems of older Fallouts and Fallout 4. Infinite leveling means we can technically get all of the perks, but the perk card system means we are  effectively limited to a hard number that we can have activeat. We start with 7 points in our SPECIAL and keep gaining until level 50, resulting in 56 points worth of space for perks. This means we can have 56 points worth of perks, but have 539(!) points to pick from.
---
In terms of perk options, let's look at percentages: 
---
Fallout 3: 19/85 perk points = 22% could be used.
---
Fallout NV: 15/101 perk points = 15% could be used.
---
Fallout 76: 49/539 perk points = 10% could be used.
---
The ratio for 76 is only 2/3 that of New Vegas, and less than half of Fallout 3!
---
BUT! Say we had 76 points of SPEVIAL allocation to pick from?
---
76/539 perk points = 14% can be used.
---
That's still lower than other entries, but MUCH more reasonable! Plus 76 points of SPECIAL results in an average of 10-11 out of 15 per SPECIAL stat across the board. Which is pretty in line with the SPECIAL distribution ratios of Fallout 3 and New Vegas!
---
They’re easily the best new enemy, IMHO.
---
I agree, but believe it or not you’re gonna havensome fools pop on here to say “ooh but it’ll make it too easyyyyy” or some other unhelpful faulty logic. 
---
There is no proper reason or argument why we can’t have this or some other easier method of acquiring screws. And people who never craft and pipe up with “but I got 1500 screws!” are outliers and should either start crafting or shut up.
---
The game makes you craft and scrap weapons to learn mods (*not* talking abut piddly combat rifles here, there’s lots of guns enemies don’t drop and don’t appear frequently on the ground) and so we need screws, lots of them. Every gun represents hours worth of scavenging just for mats to learn their mods and worst of all that learning is RNG based so some folks can take several hundred screws worth of guns or more just to learn them.
---
It burns you out on the game. I’ve stopped caring cause when I log in I just see long grinds ahead with no real value to my efforts. Why bother if the game feels this way?
---
XDDD
---
Bethesda cannot afford not to keep the game going.
---
No you’re 100% right I love them
---
I seem to be relogging into the same server a lot where as just a few weeks ago I could quit the game and relog to a new server. That leads me to believe people are leaving.
---
That being said you would think with less people on, stuff like lag and disconnects would be greatly reduced but I find it to still be a major problem for me.
---
Shit. What's soap for then? I swear I pick that stuff up like crazy for no reason then. 
---
Someone nuked North of Grafton, and there was a fair amount of violet flux on the northern edge of the zone. I got at least 30, but there may have been more. Probably not the 70+ that you got. The wildlife was mediocre at best. 
---
It's not a recommendation, but it is an option. 
---
&gt;While I think allowing a total respec for free at anytime is too much, I don't think being able to seperate your ranked perk cards would be too much.
---
I completely agree.  They should have made it so we could stack cards and then later unstack them if we wanted to get a lower level in that perk.  I started out with a Rifle build so I got all 3 Rifleman cards to level 3.  Then I decided I wanted to do a commando build so I got all those cards to 3.  THEN....I decided I need room for level 3 Concentrated Fire so I need to take one of the 3 commando cards down from 3 to 2.  It's a real hassle.
---
Someone suggests this every week... I’ll still upvote because Bethesda ignores it 
---
yeah at least from the Scrapper perk. What a useless perk in 76; it was so good in 4.
---
Animated ones. You probably have a few already. When you open a perk pack the gold card has a chance to be an animated version of the perk.
---
There was the one Overseer mission where you have to kill her husband and when I went there to do it, he was already dead because another player already killed him. I server hopped 4 times until I found him alive. If Bethesda adjusted his respawn rate at the launch of the game then I wouldn't have had to do that. Now I believe they fixed it since this was right after launch. 
---
I fully agree, there are lots of issues with the game mechanics, but I believe this one will remain unchanged, as it's intended to work against those attempting to take over or steal from the workshop.
---
They definitely need to fix the issue with team mates, &amp; it seems to be just with some locations, like the Gorge Junkyard, while the Charleston Landfill works ok.
---
Fo76 has exactly the same formulas of fo4?? I mean: is this 100% accurate?
---
Yes please. Screws and possibly springs. How is it I can find springs by scrapping a clipboard and none in a damn pipe pistol...makes no sense.
---
I am with you. No way am I grinding through some of those awful fetch quests again.  I actually cannot think of one quest I want to redo. In Fallout 4 I restarted multiple times to play a different faction and get a different ending. Here I know that the quests won’t change and either will the ending. I’ll just keep my high level, work on a base and grind legendary tire irons. 
---
And springs too, I always seems to miss some at the worst time possible haha. 
---
I’m also finding out some perks work better than others. My low level character had Serendipity and I can’t believe how good that is
---
Or at least have it named after the pieces.  Some examples:
---
* 4 X-01 pieces with 2 T-60 legs?  Call it X-01 Power Armor Chassis.  3 Excavator pieces and 3 T-45 pieces?  Name after the helmet.
---
* Name it after the Helmet type.  No helmet, name it after the chest type.  No chest, name it after the Left arm and so on.  2 T-51b Helmets on 2 different frames?  Name them T-51b(1) PA Chassis and T-51b(2) PA Chassis.
---
* Name them in order of collection.  Power Armor Chassis 1, PA Chassis 2, 3 and so on.  Scrapped PA Chassis 1?  The next chassis collected will be named PA Chassis 1.
---
I only have 3 Chassis and 1 is painted the Tricentennial colors so it's not difficult to manage, but imagine having 8 or 9 painted and unpainted.  That'd get so confusing trying to manage.
---
No problem, I hate when people do that:
---
"I know what I'm talking about so I assume everyone else will too, no need to provide key contextualising information!" 
---
You're not missing much. He was banned from Fallout 76 on Friday, then spent all weekend spamming every sub he could think of to try to get unbanned, which led to those subs banning him for spamming. Dude's a spaz and needs to learn some patience and how business days work.
---
Thanks! To be honest, I would like it even more if there were battle trains driven by Responders, or even Raiders, but I guess you can't have everything... 
---
Well speaking of myself, i haven't logged in since the previous patch that broke alot of things, including 21:9 ultrawide support.  
---
I thought they would fix it with the Hotfix, thing that didn't happened. I refuse to play it at any other resolution or aspect ratio than the one i have, it's a matter of principle thing right now.  
---
The worst part is that i'm hitching to play it again, but i feel bashed and not respected as a customer. So here i am, patiently await for a "patch" to fix things again, for us ultrawide users.
---
I have a feeling this ins't popular opinion but I think Power Armor should be much stronger than normal armor. It is a freakin' militarized exoskeleton made from think steel designed for heavy combat, how would that not be stronger than regular armor? I feel like if someone wants to walk directly into an area minutes after a nuclear bomb was detonated you would absolutely need some kind of heavy duty, lead lined, environment suit. On top of that PA is the single most iconic part of Fallout, it's on the cover of all the games except New Vegas. The only thing I can think of as to why people don't like it is purely aesthetics and the HUD.
---
And so this has gotten of course of the main topic. There's options people. 
---
Wow. Thank you. I already have marsupial so I can get by without the shocks but it would be nice to have.
---
i literally hate you   XP
---
Even then, who knows how extensive it will actually be. Custom weapons and animations are impossible now that they use Havok 2015, which nobody that isnt part of a big studio can even get their hands on reguarly thanks to Microsoft. And they use middleware for some lighting (Enlighten) as well. So any possible new areas on private servers might be screwed looks wise unless its bundled in.
---
Same here OP. I disconnect after maybe 7-10 mins. Only thing I did yesterday in game due to this, was go around selling shit on my 2 characters to all the vendors for daily reset.
---
Xbox1 with open nat and amazing internet speeds.
---
&gt;If you're playing and get disconnected and login to a new world, you just server hopped. Is that cheating then?
---
That's a stretch. C'mon now....
---
the server I was on last night was completely empty except for me and another guy. He had most of the northeast workshops and I ha a few in the southwest. Didn't have to worry about PvP at least!
---
Cool. I didn't know Super Duper also worked with crafting armor.
---
I was born in 1961, and text-based games like this and the Zork games that followed it were the first non-arcade games I ever played.
---
Some of them were brutal, in that if you didn't pick up a particular object early in the game, you simply couldn't get past a puzzle later on. You had to start all over again.
---
Choo choo!
---
Hahaha. Thanks for the tip.
---
I always assumed they were survivors of the war who hid in the mines and mutated.
---
They wheeze because they have permanent black lung and wear miner masks out of habit from when they needed them.
---
Maybe he was cooing because he noticed you were on a roof and thought you were RPing as an armored pigeon 
---
Mediocre? When I saw that and investigated, meager is the word I’d use. Killed maybe 4 things after completing a few circuits. Violet flux was in abundance though that is true.
---
My main has this exact problem. It’s like I’m wearing meat diapers!
---
Odd thing is my alt, is much more luckier. Low strength and endurance but high for agility perception and intel. Goes into sneak mode and loses them.
---
I’ve heard the familiar fap flapping and ducked. I’ll see that flying asshat peeing everywhere near me and I’ll duck and cover and sneak the fuck out.
---
Until I’m taller not worth it to me to waste ammo or time.
---
Did you get it?
---
This why I always team up when I take a workshop, odds are unless you are both extremely local to each, you won’t both get disconnected together.  That way you can rejoin the team when you get back in.  When you drop off, the other team mate becomes the workshop owner, and they can disconnect once your back in if you want to take ownership again, else you just share all the loot.
---
I only play about an hour a week now. When I log in I usually just go loot some stuff and then look around for a minute or two and wonder what to do. Then I log out. 
---
Apparently the secret is to play extraordinarily slowly. Like 60 a minutes a week slowly.
---
All these posters I see proclaiming how much they're enjoying the game sure don't seem to be spending much time in the game they claim to enjoy.
---
Aw man, shame you didn't have someone play the  wind "tuba" instrument.
---
No. I am not going anywhere with you, server hop with someone else!
---
Just have to wait and see really, i cant say im super hyped for mods as up until FO4 i necer even used them, but i know a lot of people are super hyped for them so the more the merrier
---
Come setup shop
---
What about with the perk, does that give you the screws eventually?
---
Always have your camp on a junk collector and use luck of the draw. I'm always sitting on at least 200 screws, springs, and gears.
---
Yup, im hunting for the 3star executioners rolling pin
---
How does it work?
---
With my hours in play I'm alone three quarters of the time anyway (11p to 3a) and I'm loving it. When I server hop there's typically 4 to 5 people usually. I'm loving it, and hope it continues. While everyone in game I've met have been pretty awesome, i dont want to group. 
---
Well.  If there is no queen and fewer enemies there is less of a chance of crashes and disconnects?   One small bonus if they really only want plants. 
---
if it's the civil war cemetery then yes, there is a daily quest from Fort Pritchert to return an unearthed soldiers remains to the memorial site. Once you pick up the skeleton from fort pritchert, you go to the cemetary down the road and bury them in the grave.
---
I've been jumping in on whitesprings nukes just to collect the flux ingredients other than plants. They weigh a lot and take up a lot of space but I figure once I have a decent supply of hardened mass and the other items then i can set off a nuke for the plants i need and be ready to go. 
---
I hate how quickly flux degrades, and how hard it is to find enough ingredients just to get one stable one. 
---
Are there any guides that tell you what plants turn in to what flux types?
---
Yeah I'm still tryna learn the mods for most useful armors I've given up on scavenging to craft them instead I just buy the from whitesprings n decon them. Sadly tho sometimes (usually) I dont get squat. As for screws yeah seems when you need them you dont have them and when you have them you dont really need them. I just hit 50 n realized I had 150 screws. Probably cuz I stopped crafting n started buying. Sadly I'm broke tho. 
---
I was walking around one time and I watched a  **scorchbeast**  spawn near me just for YOLOs. I am just like could you please just F-off.  -\_- I am just over here looking around and  **scorchbeast**  is like "Hey how you doing. I got some candy over here want some?" No I dont please F-off and let me look for drugs in peace. 
---
You raised my hopes and then cut them down like a cranky deathclaw.
---
Suddenly it’s dawned on me what kind of vendor I’m supposed to become. Ladies and gentlemen, the tumbleweed vendor.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YBoIoJVVp5c
---
I’d need another patch to confirm but based upon their habits this is gonna be a confirmed dying game depending on that. IMO Patch 5 was their last good chance. Now they’re in fuckup territory and another 2-3 bad patches will seal it. Even if the next 2-3 knock it put of the park, best they can do is stop losing players and keep a small, dedicated base. The launch numbers will never come back.
---
Putting my camp somewhere beneficial is always something I forget to do.
---
Are there any locations with more than one junk pile?
---
The player base is shrinking. I have been in a nuke at Whitespring twice in the past week where I am the only one there. 
---
Best place to farm screws/ springd
---
S
---
Whitesprings
---
Bunkers
---
Killing a wendigo with a clown costume daily 
---
Military outposts. 
---
Sugar cove (clusterfuck of springs) 
---
I cant remember the others lol
---
Just a building with multiple sales windows, I feel like when people see more then one person in a location they come to investigate. Boom, sales. 
---
I thought it would be cool if we could purchase tickets from the ticket vendors, purchase a bundle of tickets at a discount 
---
I did eventually find the shocks in the vendor during that time but still to this day have never seen the jet pack. Finally broke down and paid caps for the jet pack. I would recommend finding someone selling mutation syrums, way cheaper than vendor. 
---
I would like to see Bethesda's community person say something. T-T I just getting to a point of "I don't know what I am doing" T-T
---
the dude reminds me of the guitarists from Gwar, Balsac The Jaws of Death.
---
i already had the fusion generator plans. had them sense the beta i think, i just opened my camp build mode one day and could just build it, idk if i got it as a quest reward or if i got a lucky bug.
---
You are probably further along than me and I'm almost level 70! I am just enjoying the exploring and crafting. I spend half my time at my camp making armor or modding people's weapons. It's just fun! My GT is Kaise7en and I'm always down to go exploring in the wastes! 
---
My god. So much better. I don't know why people do that tonemapping shit.
---
Yes, to have nothing "visual" in front of you is strange. I've tested Colossal Cave Adventure as a browser game and it's shocking how lost you feel when you only get 2 lines of text as scene description :-)
---
A little bit of this level of difficulty would be good for modern games as well
---
My Melee Char looks similar but take no weapon perks for my self found silent Gauss (not realy need, is good enough) i like to use armor parts that give more armor the LOWER my health is, because adrenal reaction+armor bonus starts early on so that if the situiation gets nasty, i´ll get stronger and tougher the lower my health goes and after the fight i can heal. Its super tanky (full set gets me over PA Stats) ;)

---
Used to happen to me all the time while un-encumbered.  Now that Im over weight, it hasn’t happened.  
---
How do you know what to sell stuff for?
---
Hmm... I'm still secretly hoping that we will have a few few human NPCs in the future. You know, some people that were hiding until we defeated the scorch menace. 
---
Got a bloodied super sledge for my bloodied build. Switch worlds and it's gone.
---
It happened again to a different weapon but 8 noticed right away. Not sure what caused it but I think it had something to do with the level up menu
---
At least folks had a goal when we were farming for TSE. What is it now, farming steel, lead and gunpowder?
---
eventually
---
We got twenty glowing ones in 3 distinct groups, so better than your 4, but still pretty meh. 
---
First patch would need to be big in a sense of content to get that rolling. Maybe cracking open a few vaults and getting settlements going a bit so there are people there to actually rebuild the tracks quashing 3 major community concerns in one and enabling this amazing idea of map progression through live service.
---
Concerns:
---
1) Lack of PvE content
---
2) Lack of people 
---
3) Lack of vaults
---
And until the fast travelling is in a usable state using the vaults as fast travel points could help.
---
Not sure how this sits with team cannon though, and how massive map changes would work in a open world game with many people. Would it just show for one person or would someone have a bridge appear above them randomly ect.
---
Early in the game I tagged Ballistic Fiber for search and I remember a magnifying glass icon on the Trifold Flag but maybe something else was tagged as well. Weird. 
---
ug, same with me dude except with me it was server maintenance. **worst hours of my life, EVER.**
---
I love Bethesdas lil easter eggs they put it. My favourite is the Indiana Jones one in NV. If you haven't seen the 4th movie what happens is Indiana hops inside a fridge to escape a nuclear blast and at the end walks away unscathed. In NV you find a fridge with a skeleton inside it along with a hat and whip 
---
I’m glad you’re on ps4, because I thought this was my camp!
---
good god, 10 hours a day?! what do you DO in your life?
---
I’m just saying I love the game and Bethesda games for the imagination and creativity. The game and the community just needs LIFE
---
You're back with the same song an dance...  This post is less self incriminating than your last one.
---
Good luck I guess.
---
You can actually get 417 lead ore in one lucky hole mines run. 
---
I pick a price and people can decline with a reason, so we can haggle
---
&gt;Don't get me wrong, alot of that fun was due to playing with friends, but it was still fun.
---
So you're saying a game, whose whole concept was "wouldn't it be fun if you could play fallout with your friends?" is fun when you play it with your friends? You might be on to something here.
---
&gt;I don't understand and agree with alot of the design decisions.. Like making melee 30x better than ranged (from what I've played). 
---
It's not, really. Aside from one extreme build, the best melee builds are only doing slightly more damage, if that, than the best ranged builds, and the ranged ones can do it without having to get close. And that one extreme build means building your entire character--mutations, armor, weapons, perks--around low health effects, and then running around with low enough health that level 5 scorched can one shot you. Yeah, you can kill things fast doing 1000+ damage, but you still spend more time on your back than pretty much any gun build.
---
&gt;And making power armor 2-3x as good as nonPA. 
---
That's not really true either. Per armor can be really good, but so can legendary non-power armor. Mostly it's a playstyle difference. A lot of powerful builds (like the aforementioned unyielding melee, or the basically invincible assassin sentinel) aren't possible in power armor.
---
&gt;Also, I don't get why legendaries drop wooden armor etc. That seems ridiculous.
---
Wooden armor is some of the best armor for pure stealth builds.
---
No idea, maybe it is not fully ready or they're focusing on fixing the game before adding content.
---
I wouldn't go for deleting them, but the ability to store/hide them, to exchange x amount of them for a different one or something would be very nice. I've got so many that I just don't need/want in addition to the I think 16 level-ups I just haven't activated yet. A way to get them out of my face would be super.
---
sadly my entire line up of friends/teammates have dropped off this game
---
I'm surprised this even happens with usually less than 29 people on a huge map.  I guess in the 'hot' spots it could get busy 
---
how hard is it to type out like eight extra characters
---
Okay so what are your main sales in?
---
I see comments like "let me rejoin my old server!" all the time, and also see people who hate server hopping. I think Bethesda is doing backend work to keep players on similar servers, for example the "play with team" functions different after the latest patch.
---
That would be so helpful. 
---
Also it boggles my mind people downvote this, it's not like the OP was saying anything negative about the game, only suggesting an addition that would improve it.
---
go check out r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
K bro. I’ll make sure to personally update you when I do  infact get un banned LOL
---
Don't scare me like this. I always use a certain suitcase which is a bit out of the way to trade stuff to and from my mules. Always risking someone walking past and looting it, from your title I though you might have come across someone else's loot-drop-off spot.
---
I'm guessing you meant 417 lead scrap not lead ore. With the result of super duper, chemist and all that.
---
Oh I know, believe me.
---
Up to this point "let modders fix it" was a slightly cruel meme.
---
Bethesda, though, has now utterly proven themselves incapable of releasing finished, polished, stable products. This despite a decade with their engine.
---
Do your research first. All the negatives are not entirely true but it's not all positive either. Just be wary of false influence and make up your own mind about it. 
---
Scorchbeasts have the skyrim dragon UI btw
---
The janitor is working hard on the special PvP game mode, he has to figure out how to flip the switch off for pacifist on a few servers. Coming soon this spring. Or summer. Meanwhile , feel free to browse the frequent new addtions to the atom shop.
---
Just found this and this was the only thing that popped up to find my answer. Thanks!
---
I am...not certain Bethesda employees testers...
---
After you complete the main quest, there's no other things that invites you playing this game.
---
This game besides normal bugs is unplayable, too much lag, freeze and other shit.
---
And i'm saying this as an old Bethesda fan.
---
Agreed. Half of your shots don’t even land simply because you can’t fucking see what you’re shooting at. They either need to screech slower, or the animation needs to be scaled down a bit.
---
Nope 417 ore. If you follow both secret passages they are loaded with lead ore. Theres also nodes on the ceiling in some places. My first run through I got about 140 until I went super slowly and examined every single wall and ceiling. There is a lot more than you think in there. This is using excavator armor. 
---
Yeah - a discard pile.
---
Tons of clothes, some weapons and armor, ammo, junk, and some chems, plans. I'm all over the place.
---
Amen. Power armor should be the absolute end-all be-all of armor when it comes to damage mitigation. It's been that way for over 20 years in these games.  There should not be chodes in magic leather armor running around being impervious to damage. 
---
maybe some punctuation here and there wouldn’t hurt
---
Unarmed melee
---
Instigating weapons/ bloodied
---
About 350 damage - double if at full health with instigating
---
About 700 damage with bloodied weapons at lower health.
---
IMO, the whole caps cost never made any sense to me and should be removed in favor of a hunger/thirst cost.  IRL, a person could walk from one end of the state to the other a not spend a cent, but their hunger and thirst would be impacted. We now have a cap sink with access to all the plans.  
---
I did get the marsupial mutation but the extra carry weight would be nice with the shocks. A few weeks ago a friend got the jet pack after server hopping. He put it in his stash since he didn't have all the resources yet. Got the resources and looked in his stash and it and his other mods were gone due to that time when mods would get scrapped accidentally. 
---
Yup. That has happened to me too, where my ONLY option was to respawn at Vault 76. Nothing else appeared on the map.
---
You do you.
---
I don't think so. 
---
Try out the fireproof perk - sonic attacks are energy and explosive. They only tickle me!
---
I think the Atom shop is the only thing they ARE working on
---
Ahhh, yes thanks.
---
Cool what’s your psn name and I’ll add you 
---
I have to do this the first few times I do any Powering Up quest at each location.
---
Set up a camp due south of Hemlock, at the base of the cliff.  It makes it easy to claim Hemlock when ever you get on(assuming it isn't already claimed) and you can farm the 2 snallygasters that frequently spawn a little north, near the crashed Vertibird/bot.  Those Snallygaster respawn roughly every 15 minutes, but sometimes Super Mutants will spawn instead.  Between the Snallygasters and collecting acid from Hemlock, you should get to a point that you never need to farm it again.
---
they scare the shit out of me
---
I’m close to giving up on the game, ONLY for the fact that I haven’t been able to place a camp blueprint SINCE DECEMBER! I am getting so sick of rebuilding my camp every damn time I play. 
---
I'm on PC as well, and it's only been recently that this happened. It may also be a combo of where my camp was and the hours I played too. No idea how many hours I've logged honestly. 
---
I only pick up ultracite and aluminum ore which are rare.  So I have 100 + acid. 
---
The problem is their formula for armor penetration is heavily weighted towards high damage weapons.
---
They need to add degredation to enemies armor so that high rate of fire low damage weapons can keep up.
---
You cant build over a fissure site 
---
Only logged on a handfull of times in the last couple of weeks, don't think I've played more than 10 hours (was playing daily with friends). None of my friends are playing now, from 4 of us to just me.. I even got the lone wanderer perk since I'm pretty sure my friends have uninstalled and communication in game with emotes doesnt make it easy to get new teammates. How hard is it to add text chat? At the current pace of updates, it could easily be a full year before this game is actually up to standard.
---
for that blank perk name i personally think it should be "combat ready"
---
Plugh.
---
Nothing happens.
---
If you need violet flux nuke in between hemlock holes and the waterpark - ~250 flash ferns there.
---
Had a whole thread on this that was trending obviously they didn't care enough
---
Always bring more than one nuke card.  
---
All ot takes is a fat finger or the day the codes reset and you don't have the new one yet.
---
Who ever says there aren't any challenging dungeons never tried picking the locked door in Blackwater Mine while thousands of Mole Miners suddenly appear behind you.
---
Nah it's supposed to be difficult and intense. I don't know what level you are and I won't make any assumptions about how you play the game. But from my perspective, there's so little in the way of challenge to enemies past a certain level it makes the game dreadfully dull. At least the sonic spam makes the fight a little trickier. 
---
Nut-in' doing. It's just a wrench in the gears right now.
---
Quick Tip. You can shoot its face and if you do enough limb damage they stop screaming and land for my melee buddies. 
---
I get steel from mole miners.  Tons from scrapping their weapons.  
---
That could be. If it was me making that change I would add a prompt for the player to decide.
---
If I'm going on a nuke run I'll play on the server for about twenty minutes hit some benches, check the map for player levels, ft to Whitesprings or another high spawn location to check lag etc to minimize the possibility of disconnecting on a crappy server either in the silo or in the post blast fray.
---
If the player pool is mostly between lvl 1-60 or there are clear server issues I want to roll the dice for a new server.
---
I rock a legendary set so my only option is to farm ballistic fiber every once in a while. :(
---
3 shouldn't fucking spawn at anywhere except maybe a nuked fissure..
---
[PS4] was on this morning at around 10 gmt and their was  only 9 people on the server including myself   
---
Sometimes, if you hit the respawn button the map will be blank.. hit the cancel button, then try to respawn again. The places may show up. It worked for me a few times... and other times, I was in your position
---
It means re-used assets bro.
---
I keep running into the same players after a few weeks, it’s pretty cool, but very very disheartening
---
Thats because people are getting tired of the same salty responses from everyone here and going elsewhere, you cant be positive around here at the moment without getting downvoted, and no doubt this comment will get downvoted for stating this.  
---
If you correct someone whos bullshitting - downvoted.  
---
If you say anything positive - downvoted.  
---
If you provide proof that they were bullshitting - guess fucking what, downvoted.
---
Pretty sure the constant sonic spam is not intended, I think Beth addressed this. Whether they fix it or not SB will be more manageable instead of being a total pest.
---
I managed to reach the central terminal with like 20 seconds left
---
After 50 minutes :/
---
I just want some real main quests. Do I really want to be a fireman since I was 6? No.
---
Very far north to the east of the alligator picture theres a junk pile and lead collector close enough together to place a camp. That's where I have mine at. It's my own little ammo factory.
---
Screws *tend* to strip when you remove them? What are you doing when you're removing screws from things that you're stripping them so often? I rarely ever have a screw strip out on me when disassembling something because I take a bit of care when unscrewing them. 
---
I agree scorchbeasts are super annoying. The other day I was chased by one for about half the map. I would be in caution, and hide after a while then hidden. I would see the scorchbeast fly really far away. as soon as I stood it was right back on me. it killed me. I went back for my loot thinking there was no way the bitch would still be in the area... nope killed me again. so I left the server after wasting a bunch of time on that crap. 
---
Thank you friend. Typically I'm very lurky. Sometimes you just gotta get high and talk about pie though.
---
They were programmed years ago....for Skyrim :/
---
Monkey's cut and paste the assets into what we have now, FO76 :)
---
I used it back in November on my first character and it did work, but that was before many nerfs and patches that broke more than they fixed.  Didn't have it on all the time, but it did come in handy when the whether went from Rain &gt; Radstorm &gt; Fog &gt; Radstorm &gt; Rain &gt; Fog &gt; and finally Clear.  Coupled with Healing Factor, it was a good time to pvp and people actually used Hunter Hunted back then.  Also made the Hunter Hunted more interesting with the poor visibility.
---
The weather hasn't been that "dynamic" since.
---
At least yours actually hit the ground: [https://i.imgur.com/QGMSNVD.png](https://i.imgur.com/QGMSNVD.png)
---
I think it's more important that we talk about that everything we craft requires aluminum yet every weapon I scrap gives ducking steel!  Are about characters stupid in their material identification or is there some kind of molecular reaction that happens when I hit the scrap button?
---
Worrying about what Bethesda intended in a game this poorly executed is a waste of time. Know what else they didn't intend but was way better before they fixed it? Mirelurk Queen acid spit being overpowered. MQs were the real end game content, baby, once they nerfed those they removed the last real threat from the game. Also bring back the beef stew for the server when someone does Feed the People! 
---
Sometimes we benefit from Bethesda's bungling, the scorchbeast sonic spam is one of those instances and we shouldn't lose it because some people mess their huggies about it. 
---
Monongah. Then next server I tried again and it was one wave of low level ghouls (I'm level 154). Go figure.
---
I claimed the workshop at Spruce Knob, and was defending it against waves of mongrels when at least 2 SB showed up, one of them level 80. There may have been a third, but I could hardly tell with all the sonic blasts. Needless to say I bailed. Still had to use several stims til I got far enough away.
---
I defended this game so hard but it’s becoming clear that I was in the wrong.  The game is awesome and fun when it works the keyword being when it works.  It seems like every patch makes the game worse and worse.  It’s gotten so bad I just would rather play something else than have to deal with this shit.
---
Let me pay a price for a working train ride that ignores my encumbrances. 
---
Also people are leaving the game. But that's that for another explanation. 
---
If you're overencumbered, you can only respawn to the last map point you were at. Isn't that how it's supposed to be?
---
It's a pain when your location is in the middle of nowhere, but it's been that way since I started.
---
They do.  I read somewhere PA gives about 4x improvement to actually not absorbing rads, while the hazmat suits are more like 8x
---
Same.  Except for these radioactive tumbleweeds 
---
I wish I could transfer a fully leveled "blue" perk card to a newly acquired "gold" perk card. I have several animated "gold" cards that I can't use because I can't level them any higher to replace the regular "blue" cards.
---
We have also found that melee weapons have been overperforming when compared to other weapons so we fixed that. We also found that people aren't drinking enough so we're vastly increasing thirst. 
---
Why do you keep playing this game? It doesn't seem like it's enjoyable to you, there are a ton of better games out there right now to play and I wouldn't waste another minute with fo76.
---
Scrapping needs to be reworked. you telling me I scrap an assault rifle and all I get is steel and wood? I'm not even sure they even have wood. wheres the screws? the Springs? gears? I scrap a laser rifle and all i get is what, plastic and steel? no circuits? crystal shards? fibre optics? 
---
couldn't you just mod the 2-shot to be better than the crafted one though?
---
So you'd enjoy 3 at once literally NON STOP for 5 minutes screeching sonic blasts all over your screen at you? I doubt you would.
---
And I do literally mean non stop.
---
And so we get to the real goal, which isn't just to engage in PVP (which you could do with the workshop owner at any time without racking up a huge bounty of caps) but actually just to grief other players. You're not in it for the actual PVP, you're just in it for the griefing.
---
This sub to salty? Nah. I'm a southeast Louisiana Coon Ass that now lives in North Texas. Ain't nothin too salty or spicy for me.
---
But imagine my surprise when I came across my first can of "cajun rice and beans". 
---
I thought the picture was from the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series on how saturated it looked
---
Yes. You can use it to circumvent the cap limit if you have multiple characters.
---
There have been *proper full-on mods* for exactly what OP is talking about, and they were great, until Bethesda started really cracking down on people using them.
---
A workaround for dealing with disconnects and client crashes, maybe useful.
---
Fixing the disconnects and client crashes and server crashes would also be a good idea.
---
Don't you just love it.
---
Go to sugar grove i usually score 20-40 screws/hr over there
---
Thanks. Appreciate the offer. Feel free to add me in game. Would be fun to terrorize the wastelands.
---
&gt; Don't even get me started on charred ghouls. 
---
Charred Ghouls?
---
We've heard your concerns, and we've decided to add more Atomic Store items!
---
everything else will be coming *soon*.
---
Yep, acid goes fast, I don't understand why we can't have a smelter or something? We could burn wood or coal.
---
How I deal with it is I stockpile 150 units of each junk item to have room in my stash for equipment. I only pick up ore when I'm low on that certain junk item. And whenever I go out to mine or do mining events for what I need I make sure to claim the acid workshop.
---
Don't forget if you are 50+ to grab super duper and save on acid.
---
Padded and Dense are both chest armor mods so you cannot have both. Padded can be unlocked via scrapping armor and Dense is sold as a mod at vendors. The easiest one to get IMO is the dense mod for marine armor at the watoga vendors. Normally 5-10 server hops gets it for me when im looking.
---
My favorite Fallout build is high luck / critical. Apparently luck figures into pie chance so don't drive yourself insane... Or do. There is nothing quite as sweet as little PPP.
---
I think the player base (I include myself in this group) is playing less in an effort to avoid burnout (and eagerly awaiting much needed fixes/balance issues to be addressed).  Now, the issue with a multiplayer game in which players 'take a break' is whether or not they return.  FO76 isn't subscription based, which works in the games favor in regards to returning players (e.g. there's no cost to the player).  However, as 2019 moves towards the end of Q1, new titles that are being released will undoubtably cut into FO76's player base, which could signal a death knell for the game unless a DLC is dropped and/or much needed fixes are put in place.  Just my 2 caps.
---
They are a good supply, yeah. But if you want to fight a Scorchbeast or the queen or any big endgame mob, you are going to burn through a ton of ammo. And in my experience simply looting enemies and the world is not enough to keep up with demand of making ammo. I can only make a few hundred rounds at most when using my steel found on enemies. That’s fine for normal enemies, for a short period. But if I want to go into a real fight, I need 1000 rounds or more. I’ve never been able to source that much steel unless I go to a specific area, grab ore and smelt it.
---
Good to know ! I am near the station of the "Top of the World" : I can sell easily my junk, and I'm on the center of the map, I can fast travel everywhere for a little less caps !
---
Savage!
---
I kind of agree, but not at the same time. They're difficult because they're obnoxious. Individually Scorchbeasts are an easy kill. Last night I dealt with 4 in a row (one, and then three at the same time) and I never got below half health. It took a while because it was difficult to even *see* them.
---
Colonel Gutsy, Yao Guais, Mirelurk Queens/Hunters/Kings, even Fog Crawlers. Those are challenging and fun, without being obnoxious. 
---
Yup, works, best thing ever
---
Try relocating your camp

If I had gold or silver to give I’d give to you for the humor of this post title

Similar... My friend list is always grey

I'll look you up. I enjoyed building in FO4 a lot. Followed Oxhorn and Skool Zone on YouTube for the lore and building tips. A bit different in 76 with the building. Haven't looked into much crafting past having enough crops for adhesive. 
---
Or they have all the caps you spend ending the need to hit 7 of them a day and a real economy forms...
---
I agree.

this ain't r/wsb...

Numerous bugs still persist but server stability is actually pretty great on PS4.
---
Used to keep me at full health with other regen perks.  Was hilarious.
---
Just kill them.  That solves the problem.
---
Be somewhere they can land.  Shoot at them.  When they land kill them.
---
If you have a shotgun and enforcer you can pin them to the ground and kill them at leisure.
---
I stopped about two weeks ago after playing everyday since the beta started. I really want to play it but at this point I’m going to wait a few months and see if it gets better. I’ve got other games that aren’t riddled with problems. I hope the game gets better but I’m kind of doubtful that this point. 
---
Lol as long as people agree or get a laugh that's good enough for me. Certainly beats being bombarded with sonic attacks 😂

Quit reposting this garbage.
---
The place is called Torrence Manor, it's a blatant nod. Theres also a clown holding a red balloon in the whitesprings clubhouse fridge.
---
It’s mainly and completely, server lag, not a dmg bug.
---
Yeah, this is their anti travel while overencumbered mechanic.  AKA, you'll lose your junk but keep an inventory full of weapons and such.  So, instead of letting you use death to fast travel, they just remove all the markers from the map.  Sometimes though, you don't get your closest marker, you get NONE.  So you have no choice but to quit out and lose your junk.
---
Oil.
---
All the usual places I frequent for junk seemed more likely to be picked over now than before.  With only two dozen players per server, it's hard to extrapolate what that means.  Was I able to get into "fresh" servers easier before because a bigger player base means more servers opening more frequently?  Or are there more players search my areas now?

 thoughts of bethesda: we must put more objects in the atomic store  
---
Proof of the fan theory that Skyrim is set in the far future of Fallout.
---
Devs: we are aware that some players are now stuck in the vaults, we are aware of this and have passed it on to our team. 
---
This is such a fun idea! Reminds me of paying gold to travel to different cities in Skyrim by traveling on a carriage.
---
Sorry but I’m gonna expose the new duplication glitch so it will get patched quicker. If you don’t like it tough luck cause there’s nothing you can do about it. :)
---
Yeah i imagine a lot of people are leaving the game, which happens with literally every game, people play the fuck out of it for a few days/weeks/months then they get bored and go play something else.  
---
I havent played rimworld in weeks, doesnt mean its shit, i havent played civ in over a year i think now, havent played FO4 since FO76 came out.  
---
Doesnt mean any of these are bad, just means im playing something else
---
When they would add degradation to enemies they would probably have to rework the entire system, so a basic flat out damage boost could also probably help (even through perks)
---
Ahhhh... you have played ARK. 😂
---
Your game is doing stages of loading.  This game is not optimized well. I would suggest heavy tweaking to your Config.
---
One useful tool at the fallout76 nexus is the Bethesda Configurator.  Use mods at your own risk.
---
The title had me perplexed but after reading the whole post I think it’s a great idea I would be in the middle of that fight lmao
---
Do yourself a couple of favors..
---
\#1. Invest in the Green Thumb perk card.. it doubles what you pick up. Invest in Super Douper perk.. it has a chance of doubling what you create. Possibly Good with Salt perk, which makes your perishables last longer
---
\#2. There may be a guide out there for what plants do what, but I generally go by the color of the plant. Yellow/orange plants give yellow flux, red plants generally give crimson, blue/green give cobalt, florescent give florescent, purple plants give violet.. there are some oddballs though
---
\#3. Whitespring has an abundance of every type of flux, except violet. All other crafting stuff like the high-radiation fluids, hardened mass, and glowing mass can be looted from glowing ghouls, even if someone else previously killed them
---
\#4. Find the closest chem station before you start picking, or plan ahead. In Whitespring, take a trip inside to the vendor with all of the different stations. Cranberry bog can be tough, but maybe build a CAMP nearby. Harper's Ferry is a good place to nuke, and has a Chem station near the vendor, etc..
---
Charred Ghouls are nothing.  It's hordes of Mr Blobby that kill me.
---
I wouldn't mind but they always spawn outside my camp. 
---
Charity pie is destroying the pie-conomy.
---
Yeah, honestly, I'm still using All Rise as my primary, and I'm level 112. If I'm in a lower level area, I'll use my fast security baton, but that's it... I've yet to get a good drop for something better than All Rise.
---
I have noticed server hoping doesn't always result in being put on a fresh server now, sometimes I've had to hop 4-5 times for it to put me on another one :(
---
Bethesda removing servers / hardware? Why i this happening now? Does it only generate new servers when there are enough people to warrant one or could they actually have reduced hardware?
---
Looking for this?
---
UI = User Interface. You sure you mean that one?
---
griefing is such a lousy blanket term. i am utilizing the mechanics of the game, likely as they were intended. you don’t think players shoot at me once they discover me? it sounds like you’re making assumptions based upon your own gameplay. sure, i may frustrate other players but that is clearly intended in the design of the game.  it’s not like i so something to break the game or render parts of the game inaccessible. 
---
i steal.  i steal from players that DO WORK setting up shops, they spend time and probably spend resources and further- they probably need the item ASAP or have plans intended for the materials. then i just swoop in and take it. it
---
may cause “grief” but this is exactly how the game is intended to be played. frustrating players IS PvP. PvP can be more than pulling the trigger.
---
I would but most have moved on to other games and with new stuff hitting next week, I fear none of my friends will be playing  
---
Yeah, I loved FO4s mod community and some of them are leading the charge for improvements in FO76. 
---
I’m staying clear of mods though, I don’t want to get banned for some stupid reason. 
---
Hey just want to put it out there that you can fast travel to your owner workshops that you’ve claimed around the map!! 
---
The programmer just wants to watch the world burn.
---
Agreed
---
I had the same ‘defend’ mission and ended up going through 50 diluted stimpaks just trying to deal with their sonic annoyances. And of course all my armor was broken as well. Because of the terrain, it never came down once. I gave up. Fuck that shit.
---
There were a mountain of flaws in the vanilla model. I think that most people riding the nostalgia train of classic WoW are in for a rude awakening.
---
That said, there was stuff to do even if you weren't in a raid guild. Mountains of options compared to "try to loot glowing ones" and "try to loot SBQ" while fighting the true endgame boss... the spinning arrows of doom.
---
I'll need to give that a whirl in a few level ups.

Just search this subreddit for "Bethesda Replied" you'll find many images of peoples camps and such. not so many replies on the constant stream of bug reports, but they will jump right on a picture of someones camp.

I heard Harper's Ferry is good for violet as well (around the outskirts), and there are plenty of ghouls usually too

A very small percentage of individuals may experience epileptic seizures or blackouts when exposed to certain light patterns or flashing lights. Exposure to certain patterns or backgrounds on a television screen or when playing video games may trigger epileptic seizures or blackouts in these individuals. These conditions may trigger previously undetected epileptic symptoms or seizures in persons who have no history of prior seizures or epilepsy. If you, or anyone in your family has an epileptic condition or has had seizures of any kind, consult your physician before playing.

Devs will be looking into that
---
Why is this getting downvoted??
---
Same. My friends insisted I buy the game to play with them. It's still fun but I can't blame them for their frustration.
---
It's absolutely worth it but for a different reason.
---
More steel for ammo crafting.
---
For real, you gotta be an extra kinda dumb to do this. I recently fell in a fissure and lost my ballistic fiber. No way I'm going to _willingly_ jump into one.
---
I dont mind less players. I hope private servers are coming soon so i can finally play by myself. 
---
They only hold five, but if you are at your camp standing to collect everytime one is available you should have 60 in an hour, I can confirm I get nowhere near that. I've got two of them right now. I can empty both watch one go up to five while the second one has only made two. Definitely an issue of some sort.
---
There is a duping method that involves crashing a server. Bethesda mentioned it in one of their notes. I would assume they didn’t fix it or cannot fix it. 
---
Yeah, there is a junk pile that I have a extractor on.  It happens I'd say every 3 logins for me.
---
Xbox here, yeah, population has significantly dropped.  I'm not seeing servers full of 100+s anymore.  If you do find them, they are usually exploiting whatever the latest glitch is... be it perma invisibility or stacking damage reduction armor to be unkillable and just screwing with other players. Smashing camps, things like that.
---
The TSE nerf drove away a lot of players... not just because it nerfed their big boom boom sticks... but because the justification is BS.  If their damage was so high, why are melee still one shotting all enemies and players? I'm fully specced into rifle damage, and about 75% specced into melee... I can one shot anything melee, 5 shot with rifles... TSE, Bloodied explosive, instigating, you name it... Rifles are just fully outclassed by melee.
---
All the perk nerfs without giving a free respec... well this just drove people away.
---
Combine that with the fact that enemies are loading loot SIGNIFICANTLY slower after the hotfix, if they load it at all... well I've been pretty die hard and thoroughly enjoying this game since launch... but I can't find a reason to keep playing.  Lately I log in and just sell to vendors.
---
It's only free if you already own it though
---
Its frustrating for me as I have never had any gaming friends and I've been playing games since the late 1980s. The trend towards HAVING to have a team with no matchmaking to play a game is very frustrating. It's bad enough in Destiny having to share my game time with people who call me a f*g, or whatever,  but to make a solo game like Fallout require me to find children to call me names to play with as my only companions is, to me, a bad decision. 
---
I was looking at the armor penetration formula the other day and it would be fairly easy to add a compounding function to it. This way each hot gets stronger which would help bring high ROF in line with high damage weapons.
---
Friend, I've played the game LOL I've been attacked by 3 scorchbeasts simultaneously several times. It just happened last weekend when I jumped over to Sunnyvale station to do some trading. As a matter of fact, after dispatching the trio I was disconnected from the server. When I logged back in, this time with a friend, we were beset by 2 more. It was fun! The only minor issue was the first fight wiped my ammo and I wasn't prepared to spawn into another attack, but we were lucky to be right there at a train station so we resupplied from our stashes and went back to fighting. At this point, almost 3 months after full launch, what is anybody expecting? Is the whole thing supposed to be a cakewalk with zero stakes or difficulty?
---
If there was a nuclear apocalypse, I feel like with my terrible luck I would be the person to survive and try to make the world better, only to be turned into a Scorched and killed by airdrop. 
---
And taking workshops rewards it

---
You can tag crafting components to star items you look at if thet contain whatever component(s) you want
---
I should probably add that i only target things i need. ie, im not going to go to Grafton Steel Yard and jack someone’s steal because it is too easy to acquire. (although i’ll change my own plans to steal their lead). 
---
so i don’t steal simply to amuse myself, it is tailored to the items i need at the time. if i have 9 full fusion cores in stash, then i do not steal from someone’s reactor. 
---
Except he is not actually lying...

And sure, I believe what bethesda says is true, specially after they said they ran out of canvas for their bags and thus had to ship nylon bags. Because you know, canvas is one of the most scarce materials in the world and they totally didn't sent a nylon bags because it was cheaper. 
---
Sorry, but even if they were going f2p, they would not admit it right now, because they know it would be yet another PR blunder.  Not saying they will go f2p, I don't have a crystal ball after all, but I honestly right now I would not believe anything of what they say after all the mishaps they have made.

There is a stretch of road West of Bleeding Kate's Grindhouse.  West by South-west of Whitespring.    Might be worth a look.
---
When I need lead and/or steel scrap, I farm chains of cans, since each chain gets you 9 cans. There are a few locations that have quite a few chains, and they're there again when you relog (unless someone on that server has grabbed them recently). There are a handful around the coaster at Camden Park, and there are 9 chains close together at Pleasant Valley Ski Resort and inside the first cabin just to the north. I usually stick to farming the latter since in my experience, at least 6 of the 9 chains are almost always there. If you loop through that without bothering with the enemies, you can get hundreds of steel and lead pretty quickly in a few server hops.
---
Bear in mind if you get "disconnected from sever" at the same time as team-mates, then the whole session is gone.
---
Blue screen, you can get back in by joining a friend, though of course the recent players list empties, so a friend or team-mate is the only way back in.
---
Unfortunately I have only ever seen one or the other. That moment when you hear your character strip and then disconnected from server pops up means that even if there was an option to rejoin the last session, that session no longer exists. 
---
Who knows why, maybe dupers, maybe just instability, maybe lots of people crafting at once, either way once that happens there is no session or "server" to return to.
---
Friend? Don't get condescending with me.
---
This is why we need player vendor mechanics. I sell about 100 extra screws a week to some robot that throws it in the trash at the end of the day. Meanwhile I could be storing it all outside a vendor machine at C.A.M.P. for REAL people!
---
I'll come take that bounty off your hands.
---
screws and springs.  
---
I can understand that they want them to be rare materials...but at the same time, if I can rescue a spring from a clipboard, but not from the trigger mechanism of a pipe gun.......what?
---
I'd really rather have seen the "scrapper" perk, setup like it was in FO4.  Multiple points in it, and higher levels allow you to "scrap uncommon / scrap rare" mats from weapons/armors.  I don't need more Wood/Steel. I need Nuclear Material and screws and springs!!!  It's down to that whole concept of "I know it requires these things to build it, why can't I save ANY of these things when I scrap it?"
---
&gt;1000 caps
---
"I accidentally a dozen different bases"
---
Just wanted to thank you again. I was able to get on last night and after playing around with the adrenaline perk and server hopping the damage for all my weapons returned to what they should be.
---
Fingers crossed this bug doesn't affect me again.
---
Nvm what I said, that’s easier than I expected and would probably buff them. 
---
I think their screeching is glitched the same way the assaultron head laser is.
---
Well, the Skyrim Dragon can eat you if you are too close. Just be thankful that Scorchbeasts can't.
---
yeah but fo 76 is bad..... 
---
I agree that outright deleting them probably isn't the best solution (I worry about players deleting cards only to figure out a few levels later that they did, in fact, want to use them. I ran into this when I was determined to use only one handed melee weapons before I found All Rise and had to swap cards.) The idea of storing or having a "discard" pile- as I saw in another comment here- is really interesting and a fun concept. 
---
It's only on germany, austria and switzerland, and it seems is only if you go to the store and buy the used controller yourself (no trough internet buys), so if you live in any of those 3 countries, you can try to get one!

Thanks for the tips. I know most of these.

I struggle finding cobalt and violet flux, I think those are the ones. Fluorescent and yellow I have no issue with. Just wondered what base plants turn into what. I've never made a mental note of the colors before. 
---
I'm sure you waste a lot of time and caps doing this and so you have to justify it to yourself, but it takes me less than 5 minutes to clear a workshop, throw down a fusion generator and some defenses to keep the radrats out, and then boom. Its done. Doesn't even cost me my own resources since the workshop has its own junk budget. And as I said before, if somebody wanted to show up and take fusion cores, they're so plentiful I wouldn't care. You're just trying to upset people who don't know how to easily get fusion cores yet. Your goal isn't to PVP, but to upset an actual human. That's griefing bro. Call it whatever you want, but that is what it is.
---
Don't be a thin-skinned chud. You're the one who talked to me like I've never played Fallout 76 before. You think I'm sitting here imagining what it would be like to fight a scorchbeast, like I haven't been playing since the first minute of the first BETA on XBox? Oh gosh if only I knew what it was like to fight scorchbeasts like super tough dude "ColdestGoose." Why don't you kick rocks on out of here?
---
Next week we've rebalanced all items to weight what they do on Earth or Jupiter as we see fit.  Anything that was fun we've made sure to remove.

Dense torso mod, I take no damage from the blast.
---
Not likely. Absolutely no way to prove he used the old XP glitch since they had ZERO way to detect abuse back then aside from seeing where you were on the map, making it obvious. Even then, most abusers would just crouch and disappear from the map/hide when others came near.
---
There's also no way to prove he isn't legit unless he's dumb enough to keep evidence in his inventory/storage. The games been out for nearly 3 months; that's more than enough time to get to 700 using XP buffs with nuke zone farming/server switching, which I assume most would have come from pre-XP nerf.
---
Only thing missing is the giant rad-rats!

No thanks I’m a pacifist. I just want to help more people.

I quit for many of the same reasons. Such a shame too: I've never been more excited for a game! It had so much potential. 
---
..yet
---
Glad to help and kind of glad there are still people managing to enjoy FO76. I played the hell out of it for 2 months, got the platinum trophy, and now there just isn't anything left to do. Meanwhile the recent patches seem to make the game less fun instead of more fun.
---
Hey friend, I will help you and remove that for you for free.  Just tell me where you are, and don't move!
---
It was a single turret, not heavy or anything.
---
Plant you some mutfruit, tatos, and corn. Then have a water supply. You can then make vegetable starch and then scrap it for adhesive. It gives you 2 for 1 when scrapped.  Just harvest and produce the starch on every visit b.c to your camp and you will soon be overflowing with adhesive.

Does seem to be similar in effect!

* 12 walls (doorway is still a wall) and a door
---
* 9 roof tiles
---
* 6 crafting stations for one of everything
---
* 1 bed
---
* 9 medium water purifiers (up from 6 due to recent patch)
---
* 1 fusion generator
---
* 2 power connectors
---
* 6 or 7 basic wall lights
---
* 1 decontamination arch
---
* 30 or more concrete walls to seal my CAMP
---
* 48 or so crops
---
I have a little budget left over but zero defence due to the budget cost and their total ineffectiveness. I tried removing the crops and the budget gained was miniscule, same for the concrete walls.
---
I burn through copper by crafting fusion cells, since my main weapon is an explosive tesla shotgun. The lead and plastic are easy enough to farm, but copper can be tight. For that I usually take Dabney Homestead (3 copper extractors) and Spruce Knob (1 copper and 1 acid extractor).
---
Ark was kinda weak to be honest compared to the other CPK games I've played.
---
I disagree, i’ve gotten so used to the keys combination its pretty workable. I’ve got pa and regular armor night and day builds, crafting build, travel/bargain build. And id imagine i could do a mini melee or shotgun build to switch fast from my gun build.
---
I assume it's just as difficult as it is to properly capitalize your letters and add a period.
---
I’m aware. I’ve got a bunch of karma on the trading sub. It’s a far cry from what I expect in terms of support in 2019. 
---
Xbox, sorry for not specifying
---
As someone who just recently moved their CAMP to a far corner of the map in search of new views: I love this. Also, the unreal cost to travel I now incur is making me want to go back to placing my camp just south-west of the middle of the map.
---
Fucking troll.  One turret is not a 1000 cap bounty.
---
I’ve found this is my issue. I get super motivated to play and I realize that my options are to: farm, waste ammo from fighting the queen, and...more farming. But nothing is rewarding anymore. Hopefully more people will come back when there’s more content, I know I will. 
---
Love it. Keep being you. If it works, it works right? 
---
Out of all the squads that left vault 76, only a handful of dwellers were wasteland material 
---
What armor is that available on?
---
People will come back once there is more content, I'm pretty confident. 
---
I have to admit I haven't been playing much since New Year. I really enjoyed the quests but there's only so many times I'm willing to farm Whitespring, ya know? Can't justify it with so much else to play. BUT once they have something else to do I will be right back on and I'm sure many others will too. Probably won't see player pops like we had in the early days after launch but I think that's pretty standard with any game, yeah?
---
The nonstop spam is bullshit.
---
I flipped a workshop just to do that whole foundation temple stack thing and I had the exact same problem as OP.
---
Three that wouldn’t stop spamming. At. All. Well, one of them did the yellow crop dusting attack, but the other two were shooting like they were laying down cover fire
---
Yes! We are looking into this later this year. We very briefly mentioned this in on our [Known Issues and Feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am3agv/fallout_76_known_issues_and_feedback/) list.

As long as you have paying costumers that give complete bug test for free like we do they don’t have to

Look out we've got an ultimate badass here.

Impossible, there's no npc to be able to wear the train as a helmet
---
I dunno man, I took the disposal site workshop yesterday and immediately had to defend against a scorchbeast duo. Typically they will land once you kill all the ground troop scorched, and then they're easy pickings. Just build smart base defenses (concrete foundations, metal walls, strong roof), kite them around your defenses to dodge their attacks, and bide your time until they land.
---
God forbid an enemy in this game requires some patience, planning, and strategy. I *like* the fact that at least one type of enemy doesn't blindly throw itself at the hail of gunfire.
---
We are supposed to be rebuilding... but every time I look at the pip boy it's the same day...

There really needs to be an emote for "Please shoot me" sometimes people are so reticent to claim a bounty
---
You might get downvoted for this but I agree. 
---
Assassin's Sentinel can be devastated by a gamma gun or melee attacks
---
Less "ultimate badass" more "I'm not 200 hours in, still level 25 and creeping around the forest hoping I don't run into something more difficult than a level 6 scorched."
---
Ah so not worth it to use this over a lv 50. Thanks!!
---
Well, that's the issue, isn't it.
---
Some pore over the Perk Build sites and plan exactly what they're going to do.  I understand that style, but it's not mine.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
🤔
---
I personally think if you build them and they kill something, the owner should get the XP without having to get a shot on the enemy first.
---
Go on nukacrypt.com if you wanna solve the code or go on nukacrypt.com/solved to see the codes
---
If you're already an enclave general just go to the silo because there are no backdoors
---
You don’t actually need the silo codes. There’s a website that updates them weekly it’s the same for everybody.
---
Never done it myself either.
---
Google or find the nukacrypt website
---
It was the bright paint in the atomic shop. It may still be there. 
---
More effective than the actual LMG in the game haha.
---
Destroying a single turret doesn't result in a 1000 cap bounty, and I know from experience. Either you're bullshitting, or not telling us something.
---
Falcor!!!!!!!!
---
Welp, I just showed my age
---
Acid isn't that hard to come by. It's in a lot of common junk like abraxo and antifreeze bottles, and most bug parts contain acid. Some higher level enemies (yao guai, snallygaster, wendigo) usually drop at least a few acid each.
---
To be fair, I really enjoy this game (sans workshop disconnects...) and this is 100% the typical update tone I expect.
---
It's  easy solo and fuck those code pieces. Go [here](https://nukacrypt.com/solved)
---
Neither am I :-)
---
Edit: same*
---
Thank you for fixing the vats glitch &amp; disappearing paper bag drops. Helps alot, that vats glitch during a scorchbeast queen fight was brutal! Another glitch that's been happening lately is whenever I fast travel in my power armor, certain peices of the pa, will disappear.. just a heads up. 
---
P.s. looking forward to more end game content, don't let the haters get you guys down. Hint hint: end game dungeons with multiple levels and strategic boss fights.. 
---
The "I don't know what you're complaining about, I don't see any bugs" crowd.
---
Exactly. Also, they keep pushing the survival tactics too far. The game is more tedious than it is fun.
---
I uninstalled it and have been keeping an eye on this Reddit. 
---
I figure, the people left on here really want to play and will most likely only lodge legitimate complaints. 
---
From the looks of it, it will probably be a few months before I even consider reinstalling. 
---
Okay! Thanks man I appreciate it! Glad to see another friendly person! Shall I come to your camp instead?
---
then griefing is an intended mechanic in this game. it’s not like im blocking doorways or hanging up vendors.
---
why does PvP require shots to be fired? usually it turns into that, but how is it necessary? why implement locks and thievery if that itself is not considered PvP?
---
server hopping sounds tremendously boring in the sense that a player can just go capture resources with very little to no adversity. 
---
this game is specifically designed so that ayers may inhibit the progress of others.
---
All
---
It probably would have made more sense if they were simply "glowing"..  Since metal can become heavily irradiated. But i guess the robots being sick is more logical 
---
Thanks, I’ll try out up there. Although I am no fan of server hopping. The idea of forcing players into  a farming routine to source commonly needed resources is a poor one. Why can’t I get what I need by playing the game? Forcing me to leave what I’m doing so I can spend an hour trying to find resources while loading into new servers a bunch is not fun. All that so I can get back to what i actually wanted to be doing. 
---
I am happy with the amount of steel I get from ore. 1 ore becomes 4 with the PA. And 1 ore with some acid makes 5 steel. Add in super duper and it’s a great way to get steel. But then acid is the problem.
---
So rude. 
---
I'm glad somebody else acknowledges them as suffering. I think there should be some sort of questline based on studying them and maybe trying to understand how they've survived so long and maybe help them so they regain their humanity stopping them being just mindless killers.
---
I'd even be happy with mole miner disguise that would allow you to explore their caves without having to murder them all!
---
There's a dinosaur excavation site 
---
Dinosaurs are pretty big 
---
So i can have all the mutations in the game on my char?
---
Those three sites are the exits of the silos. You still need the enter thru alpha bravo or Charlie.
---
The guy before me was right ght the codes are on the nukacrypt site. You don't need to collect the pieces
---
Youll need a key card. Personally I wouldn't invite the randoms on the server but that's just me
---
If you u are on xbox I'll join you for support and someone to reconnect to incase it crashes
---
I've done it solo when I was around level 60. It can be done
---
That worked? No kidding! Glad to have been helpful!
---

complaining about the story quality degrading from FO4 and including FO76 in this despite never playing FO76.  And for frame of reference a few posts after this when I ask for specifics about how the story quality degraded with FO4 they brought up the nirnroot easter egg and the Dunwhich pit which like the building from FO3 is a nod to H.P Lovecraft's work.  They also said the Brotherhood of Steel was altered from the good guys in FO 1 and 2 into war mongers that wanted to dominate and completely conquer the east coast.  Which is not what the BoS does in either FO3 or FO4. 
---
 Example 2 https://imgur.com/Mhn0BWV

Never played the game but complains about how the game was made, the monetization of the game and claiming there is no story in the game. Again all without ever playing the game.  And the best part is that when asked how would Bethesda make money to fund the free content updates we are suppose to get they don't even attempt to reply. They just ignore that line of argument really fast. And my statement about  fans not knowing what they were buying leads into

Person is literally complaining about grinding in a survival game.  That is like ordering a salad and being upset they brought you a salad.  The amount of grinding that has to be done on this game is small. Particularly compared to other survival games like Ark Survival Evolved.  On a non boosted private server it took me and my wife about 14 hours of game time to gather enough stone, wood and thatch to allow us to build a pen to store our weaker dinos in to protect them from predators that can roam around. Because unlike in FO76 your buildings and tames are always in the world. 
---
We have literally logged in to find a level 80 Sarco had wondered into range and attacked and killed all our tames. It was burnt on our camp fire so attacked and hand wiped out 3/4th of our base and killed us a dozen times forcing us to abandon our literal days of work to have to rebuild somewhere else till we could tame a dino strong enough to kill the sarco and recover our remaining supplies that didn't despawn. 
---
Had an entire pack of tamed dinos that represented a combine total of over 48 hours work to tame, breed, raise and level be wiped out because a level 50 Alpha Allosaurus wondered off a cliff into the middle of my group with 3 other ones and wiped everyone out. 
---
Understood but as long as we've had online games we've had alternative player markets.  Back in the day we there were Diablo 2 auction houses trading Stones of Jordan for loot and any MMO has had Chinese gold farmers.  Players are always going to be more agile in creating and exploiting a market.  That said I personally want things in game as i dont want to deal with people but i can understand not putting development resources when the free market will exist anyways.
---
All but one. Technically you can’t have herbivore and carnivore. Just one or the other
---
Not sure what the other markers are for. if you have the codes for alpha, you'll go right in the front entrance where it is on the map.
---
You need level 3 hacker. That way you can turn the turrets against the robots and save yourself a ton of hassle. I'd recommend one other player to run through with you, so if you get disconnected, you can get back to the server. I won't guarantee it, but I did it with a friend when we both had the quest active thinking we could run through, use his code, then use mine so we could both complete it, but there's a timer after June launch before a second can be launched from the same silo. I was mad I would have to do it all again, but when I checked, the quest was completed for me as well.
---
If you're on PC, is run through it with you if our schedules worked out.
---
I keep seeing these posts but have yet to find a single thing.  :(. 
---
Nobody cares. 
---
I did it solo at level 65 the other night. It's easy. Lots of bots and turrets to kill. Takes a while and a bit tedious but doable.  Look up the codes for that week and make sure to have the launch card with you. 
---
Just make a new character it’s way more economical than respeccing a current character 
---
But it’s definitely worth trading for caps as a “leveling-weapon.” Perfect for people that decide to run a new character.
---
I got the game at launch but can only play in very short sittings so I’m just creeping along. Hard to play on a team with that schedule which just makes it even harder to enjoy. I just got my plans for ultracite pa, so I’ll farm the mats and give it hell until I can launch the nuke!
---
Personally im going for all the trophies, then i will put the game down until there is some DLC released. After level 100, you get all the serums, buildables, weapons, and armor.... yeah you just kind of jump around killing random enemies, maybe a event here or there. 
---
I did spend the time to read and listen to all the storylines, in all the quests and random structures. Found the floating island and been in its depth. Have all the stable flux, ultrasite, and blk titanium one would ever need.
---
Huh, the only way to kill fo76 is to *play* it like a total dickhole. 
---
Kind of ironic.
---
After completing "Mayor for a day" quest then the Watoga robots will never attack you. You can walk up to Watoga protectrons and wack them dead but assaultrons will attack back at you.
---
Amazed that I actually knew something in Guildford (Anderton's Music)!
---
still hoping they change this
---
There are no bugs if there are no players \*points to forehead\*
---
ESO even has official support for addons
---
How much more fixes do you need? Stop the fixes, release content. I stopped playing because it's all fixes and nerfs.  
---
I was loving this game, playing since the start, i became active on reddit because of it, after many years of just lurking. But i've had enough with the game. It pains me but i just can't seem to feel anything when i start the game. I check the Atom Shop, see the new floors or lamps and the ridiculous outfits and close the application.  
---
I'd rather have some content and unfixed things than the opposite. I only see the end of the road and not a roadmap. And that end is a PVP mode. Lol. PVP...  
---
Anthem is coming, Division 2 is coming and we already had 3 new Battle Royale Games. There's PVP everywhere. No one will get their PVP fix in FO76.   
---
The direction is no direction at all. This is reminding me of Paragon, from Epic Games. A minority was so vocal they thought it was the majority and it led to a lot of bad decisions. People weren't happy. It's happening here.  
---
And before the "why are you still here" brigade comes, I am still in this subreddit because i have hope.
---
That I know the definition of the word "summary"? Cause yours is more than 1/3 as long as the actual post. 
---
Good effort, poor execution: C+
---
Get marsupial and jump on top of the cabins and git ‘em. Just don’t shoot near a robot or a car near a robot because you’ll be destroyed even faster. Or another player who’s near a car because it could explode and initiate unintentional PVP...(I believe). 
---
You know what just forget I said anything. 
---
"It was the best of times, it was the BLURST of times?!?!"
---
I wouldn’t even utilize the inside for anything but crops. That’s just ugly.
---
Good job tho. If I didn’t have 3 bases locked down for being “slightly” overbudget, id toy around with the temple foundation thing more. Right now it’s just free time at public workshops
---
There are a number of ways to mitigate their attacks and kill them, you just to learn them, then they are not so hard or annoying.
---
*tags wood*
---
Your right, I forget I had that perk equipped 
---
Well it's not really fallout with friends is it? The story is barely there, the questing design is super lazy and insultingly easy usually consisting of *click E here and then there*.
---
That's not and never will be fallout. They're going to need some older elements for it to be fallout with friends, but I don't think this game will ever truly be that. I think they'll need to go true Coop for that.
---
&gt;That's not really true either. Per armor can be really good, but so can legendary non-power armor. Mostly it's a playstyle difference. A lot of powerful builds (like the aforementioned unyielding melee, or the basically invincible assassin sentinel) aren't possible in power armor.
---
None of this matters when you constantly have to repair regular armor and can't really keep a back up set.
---
I can carry like 5 sets of PA on me to experience a similar weight impact.
---
&gt;Wooden armor is some of the best armor for pure stealth builds
---
Not nearly in my opinion. Either way that was just one example. Although, I have a feeling you're the kinda guy that'll defend the tire irons and other useless crap. How about the legendaries that just loose all of their items randomly? How about the ones that just haave their bodies disappear after 30 seconds?
---
When j brought up melee balance. That was one example. However, I can definitely say that melee is all around BETTER. No, not because it has amazing damage, not because of radicool builds etc, but because it doesn't use AMMO. 
---
The way you have to maintain weapons and ammo with range builds was NOT well thought out. There are huge balance and design issues with this game. 
---
Literally everyone I've met in the wasteland agrees. 
---
You are a straight up little bitch
---
I was mostly being cheeky, but I think nuclear fricken bombs should be more rare and do way more damage
---
Devs have agreed there is a bug so..
---
I used to be an adventurer like you. Then I took an arrow to the knee.
---
Cool. Thanks for the tip about the turrets. I'm on Xbox though.
---
Only melee weapons mate
---
They remind me of those weird red-cloud-dwelling things from Fallout New Vegas Sierra Madre DLC. 
---
Do we know what made them what they are? 
---
Also, while I disagree with your sorrow for them, I just wanted to say that your last paragraph really hit me hard. I hadn't been able to pinpoint what made this game a little sad to me, but "the grind" was never a part of what made fallout games so immersive and loveable. You've hit the nail on the head on what makes me a little sad.
---
Did you miss the question mark?
---
Well roughly a third of the in game travel is via the DC metro. So ther is precedence for travel via subway in the fallout universe. There is a good mod for 4 that connects a lot of the subway stations together.
---
His was fucking horrible writing come on
---
Tried for 8 hrs straight 1 shock no jet pack.
---
I gave up and paid 2 k caps for it ( later had an 1.75k offer ) never felt better not to have to do a scavenger hunt for something with such low odds to spawn.
---
Realistically I was taking about 5-8 minutes per hop so go figure 
---
What are Usain?
---
They aren’t going to change it just because you say you want them to. 
---
When you have a bounty on you, do not pass go do not collect 200 dollars.
---
I agree with that 100%.  I had four on me once.  Took a while but I killed them all.
---
Too bad there's no Daiquiris and Creams out in Appalachia...
---
Understand, thank you
---
I just bought adrenaline reaction at the enclave vendor. Works like the bloodied perk?
---
I had a tent for a while but hated it when the rain poured through it like it wasn't even there.
---
I feel like Rank 1 procced way more than Rank 3.
---
I was running around with Rank 2 forever until I realized it doesn't even work/proc. Or at least it didnt a couple months ago.
---
Are you using the targeting hud mod?
---
Quickest way to kill a game is to give the players nothing to do.  When loot won't load in a game like this, what do they have left?
---
Wait wait wait, weapon artisan, a repair based perk, is giving damage boosts?
---
Offering sb extermination service on PS4. Online from 5-10pm us central time. Rates vary and are subject to changes.
---
Not to sound dismissive but
---
Maybe you should take a break?
---
If playing this game makes you feel like you’re at work, doing things in a mindless uneventful way without passion or enthusiasm.
---
Stop playing the game  and do something else that is fun. Whatever that is.
---
You’re not competing with anyone in the game, this isn’t a race.
---
If you’ve already lvled up other toons, and have done the end game what’s the point in playing something that bores you?
---
No. Not at all. I'd expect power armor to be amazing. However I expected some more. Cons.
---
It's 20x more weight efficient to store(this is the one that needs to change the most imo) 
---
It has superior dmg resist
---
It has superior rad resist (you can't wear any armor without PA in rad zones (other than hazmat suits that break super fast and don't offer much protection)
---
It let's you get fuckin jetpacks
---
Etc etc. 
---
There needs to be more draws to no PA builds imo. Right now I just don't see why I'd play nonPA other than I hate power armor and the way it feels. 
---
Here is an example when my explosive weapon deals some client damage, but the server just acknowledges part of it:
---
[https://youtu.be/HYHgjJrdoSo](https://youtu.be/HYHgjJrdoSo)
---
you can grab a ton of violet from Harper's Ferry (if anyone nukes it), cranberry bog (i find that the mutated ferns clumped near trees/water/crevaces turn purple, and give the violet), or search where the other's suggested
---
Good point. Everyone would have to be in Passive mode before jumping into the fray.
---
I hate when people refer to other people by name assuming you totally know who they are talking about. Johnny used to do that ALL the time. 
---
Nice !
---
It was Space Invaders and it was 1978. Life in a small town and the first arcade game I had seen. I was 13. 
---
These puns are drilling a hole in my side!
---
they were all nerfed, obviously.
---
no u
---
TSE got nerfed hard. My shotgun went from 700ish damage to 240. 
---
Thank you I wanted to edit the post after all the attention it got and mention what I really miss about these games. We need new crazy fun enemies, interesting locations and secrets. We need memes and community interest surrounding the imagination of these universes. Basically Beth games can be exploited to shit single player or multiplayer. As long as there’s no cap limit there will be lvl 200 players with 100,000 caps grinding. I just want content and the freedom to explore 
---
armor and apparently melee weapons get a boost if at above 100% condition.
---
yet another perk for melee I guess
---
You can polymer mod any piece of combat armor, but I think the chest piece polymer plan is separate from the limbs polymer plan. If you destroy enough combat armor you will get the mod
---
With you on that, I have experienced maybe 10% of what the other players are saying, I am not stating that it isn't happening, just stating I don't have a problem with it.
---
I don't think we can check if the math is still accurate.  But why would they change it? Maybe a light tweek in the formula. 
---
Also empiric data observed from the game is clear. Slow high damage weapons are outperforming fast low damage weapons versus heavy armored foes. Which is consistent to the formula.
---
As others suggested: % reduce damage taken is more important than actual armor rating.
---
There was nothing but mostly grinding in WoW the only mmo I think I have played that has true options to do other things was RuneScape with all its different skills starting as a bank slate and you go off and do your own thing you don’t need to quest you don’t neeed to do what the game tells you, you don’t have to raid or kill bosses to progress hell you don’t even have to fight to level up really and you can still make tons of progress and become rich I cant believe no other mmo has successfully copy RuneScape open ended formula 
---
Yeah not saying I take grave offense or anything, I've got plenty of hours in the game so I can recover easily. Found out that just logging out and back in repairs everything for free which is pretty nice, especially if you have items which require Flux to build. I could see it being off putting for newbies though.
---
A fix would either make it so bulk items didn’t act as a collection of said items or drastically change the games currency. 
---
"perhaps make friends map icons show up bigger"
---
Or perhaps just make their dots a different color.
---
warning.. there is a bug (introduced last patch) that will break down all of your bulked items in your inventory, if you select the "scrap all junk" option at a crafting station.. Bulk, store in stash, and wait for the bug fix!
---
Exactly this. I’ve done all the quests and I’m at max caps... Nowadays I log in, look at the daily challenges and maybe do a couple easy ones, wander around for a few mins and then log out feeling disappointed and sad.

I'm level 140 and was doing the "Feed the People" event for the XP boost food reward. I collected all the ingredients needed and went to the machine and opened the special inventory window. I started spamming to deposit the quest items before I realized that a couple of my Legendary armor pieces were showing up on my side of the inventory list (every other time I've done this event, only the quest items appeared on this screen). One piece went into the machine inventory before I realized what happened and vanished completely. It was most vexing. 
---
All I know is you only need 60% ammo weight reduction to make 5MM ammo weigh NOTHING.
---
Everything else can be reduced but idc if any other ammo can go weightless.
---
And this is why I’ll forever use a Gatling. TSE nerf be damned
---
RIP
---
Awesome suggestion! I do see some comments in here on how to make acquiring screws a bit easier with the right perks, but I will still let them know about wanting them from scrapping too.
---
i would say my dc's have been better all in all, although i have never had a huge problem with them. But i have definitely noticed being dropped back into the same server a few times. I was server hopping, farming watoga for T60 parts, last weekend and it seemed like it would rotate me through the same 3 or 4 servers. 
---
The same thing happened to me on my first character but then I realized I made some mistakes and remade a character picking the right perks according to my playing style and I have a badass lvl 30 and I’m crazy proud of him. Redesign. Adjust. Live and learn. Orrrrrrrr give your game away to someone who will appreciate it and enjoy it! 
---
Yeah, I did that too...but I only had two of the cancer bats. I just ran around dropping turrets all over the place which #1: took their focus off me for a bit and #2: made them land and die
---
Crouching maybe
---
I believe the game needs to have the ability to do the following two things:
---
* Have multiple builds.
---
* Have the ability to place cards in a storage deck such that it reduces the clutter of the Perk interface.
---
Having multiple builds would help with situations where you are crafting, repairing, hacking/lock-picking and usage of weapons. It's very cumbersome to have to manually switch cards.
---
However, I believe once a player is engaged in PvP combat, their build becomes locked until the combat between the two players has stopped for some amount of time (probably in the realm of a minute or two)
---
No. It says that you try to make yourself feel better with your pathetic attempt at putting others down.  As someone that types and reads quickly, it is really hard to remember that there are people out there that still sound out all the words that they come across.   Hooked on Phonics only works if you practice, douchebag.
---
TL;DR:  Pick up a book.
---
That sounds... fun! Nothing mandatory, just do what you want.
---
Jeez you kinda people are negative Nancy cancer just stop playing and leave already 
---
Yeah I heard about this, there are certain ways to surpass intended slap damage and it would definitely frustrate those who are lower level or don't want to partake in PvP. You'd of thought if people were bored they'd create new content for themselves or just take a break. But you know, that would be sensible :D 
---
I reported the posts for a rule violation...
---
Yeah I was on a server at around 1am ET with only six people in it. :/ PS4
---
Maybe he had a friend on the server you were on, so he kept logging off and relogging to avoid getting killed?
---
Bullshit.  Unbalanced PvP isn't PvP.  That's free-for-all.   It is pointless PvP.
---
I don't enjoy that any more than I enjoy ghouls wailing on me, but I accept it as a challenge to overcome.  The attack is designed to disorient you and annoy you and get you flustered so you make mistakes.  Stay cool, think tactics, and conqueror.  
---
I agree! I know that actual bugs exist. Nothing game breaking for me yet though fortunately. 
---
Hmm I thought they'd just instakill the turrets lol.
---
People have been requesting the ability to save perk sets since the beginning. I think this would be a more elegant fix than deleting them. Just swap out your "lockpick/hack" set for your "big battle" set and go.
---
Really? I've used it a lot recently, especially when I notice I'm on a higher level server and see that people are queued in the top left. :)
---
That was the first thing i tried
---
That's a handy map, thanks!
---
Yeah I don't get why a miner would run around with a missile launcher, seems like a mine would be the absolute worst place to use it. They should have unique weapons like a big auger drill and maybe some drop sort of c4. Ranged weapons, shotguns still make sense as maybe they would have been used to keep vermin down.
---
is this instant or does it take time to disappear from the map. if the latter, do u know how long it takes to disappear from map? does this truly work for wanted players?
---
Well you just need an intellect score of 15 or higher. Then you’ll get those components, you don’t even need scraper if you reach 25 intelligence. 
---
Past tense it broke the otherday.
---
If ur in pacifist mode then make it so I can't be attacked my base can't be attacked and I can't attack other players or their base either.  Show me in pacifist mode by some mark by my name.  Have a 15 minute cool down to turn off pacifist mode.  Then u can go play pvp.
---
Well, guess I’m being forced to play Skyrim in fallout thanks to all these tse nerfs and shadow buffs and other fuckups such as weapon condition just melting automatics into uselessness (nothing new but a damage nerf tends to make guns break faster now)
---
I think if they block you from social menu they might , I had this happen yesterday a guy with a 200 bounty inside a nuke zone wanted and another 2 player close to him not to close , he tried to melee me ( but we all know that melee is op) my nuka cola t-51 and his xo1 and he manage to escape trough the builldings of Morgantown enough to disappear.
---
The other two players fast travel to mid of map.. I wanted to go visit but I’m sure the wanted guy was there with them 
---
I guarantee you I had Pacifist turned on when he leveled a large portion of my camp.  I had to turn Pacifist off in order to damage him.  I know it was on.  Also, I know the bounty was 20 caps because I dropped him with a two shot exploding black powder rifle.   It shoots slow, but the first shot took him down to about 5 or 10% health which I mopped up with a super sledge.
---
Which is why any normal person would either create new content for themselves or take a break and play something else. Honestly griefing lower levels isn't really PvP, it's just being a douche in my opinion. But I guess it just attracts certain personalities. 
---
I know scripting is coding, but not on the level you were implying. You basically said that from start to finish, adding items to the game required all coding, which isn't the case at all. I called you lit on that. Scripting is coding, but not remotely on the same level as digging in the game code.
---
As for the atom store, I said they may have a system to automatically take in the new assets without special coding every time. That is totally doable. I didn't turn a blind eye to it, you ignored it.
---
Their editor is designed to require next to no coding, so even their graphic artists can do world building as well, as they did back with oblivion and fallout 3. Vastly different than code bug fixing.
---
&gt; It's not just making a model and it's done
---
I literally never said remotely that.
---
I wasted all my ammo and only killed 2 weaker level 65 ghouls for a whopping 20ish XP. 
---
It sucked. Also naturally there wasn’t any good loot. 
---
I just want to explore now because the main story is just so boring. 
---
Go on?
---
I don’t think that works when you are wanted.
---
I’ve used it a few times for fun when a storm starts and it’s always worked 
---
We will spring back. If you are on xbox you can Wire me your info and we can Bond-O or or maybe just Scrap
---
Thank you, m'lady.
---
Yes scorched sloth, it was ok taming and replacing up untill i tried to get rid of the Sloth just after the patch the otherday.
---
This sub, alone, has lost around 300 members in 2 days. That could be because some migrated to the filthy casuals sub, but if you were to consider that if people are fleeing the sub, they might also be fleeing the game. 
---
I haven't seen a nuke zone all week and I need some damn flux
---
Are you talking about FO4 or FO76?
---
Because if you're talking about FO76, then that's utterly wrong.
---
Uhh.....farm White Spring Sentry robots. That's like 100 cores a hour depending on you load time.  Also other goodies like aluminum and ammo.
---
Yeah I have just over 500 hours now and I'm seeing some crazy wanted levels around Flatwoods and lower level areas. It is quite a shame really. I have 2 character builds left that I want to work on before a PvE content drop, if I am done before then I will just run challenges and take a break. I just don't see the appeal or fun in ruining other peoples fun. \*shrug\*
---
It doesn’t weight nothing, it’s just the weight value only displays so many decimal points. I’m pretty sure with bandolier 2 that 10k 5MM weighs 1lb
---
Been occasionally checking since last week, no luck though
---
I am a Pampers man thank you very much!  Huggies indeed! As if!
---
Use some Cork and Adhesive to repair you Super Duper
---
Serial griefers usually have friends nearby just to "kill" them to get rid of the bounties.  And of course, the friends would later give the caps back to them.  This is another aspect of the broken gameplay system where the bounty system could be gamed like that.
---
Yeah I stay away from there now. I kept accidentally hitting a robot from a car explosion only to die try and go retrieve my loot and have some douche take it. I get it’s fair game if I die it still sucks. 
---
Oh this is happening to me the time!
---
Tse still drops so it’s not a legacy weapon.
---
Legacy would be the exploding flamer or exploding lazer 
---
How about gut and remove the crappy half assed perk card system all together and start from the ground up. Shut the servers down till they fix and release a real game like Final Fantasy did.
---
One can dream.
---
Bring it back!!!! 
---
That's what gets me... unless 3/4 of the server is crouching when I look at the map (a possibility I'm not automatically discounting) most servers seem barren now. All the while loot lag has gotten worse in any area with more than a couple people (WS or prime during a nuke). 30s or more to loot is disheartening... especially given the sheer number of disconnects I see in those areas.
---
Almost makes you wonder if it's not the players, but a flaw in the environmental effects from said nuke.
---
Ammo, Chems, food and drink, junk, all of these are capped out weight reduction wise at 90%. Adding any more reduction will make no difference.
---
All I'm saying is it takes the fun out of it if I walk out of the vault and the first box I find is packed with a bunch of stuff I'd rather find on my own by actually playing the game.
---
Tbh, im not sure if it hides a wanted player but yes it should be instant for the normal ones. The wanted player could also block everybody from the Social Tab so everybody can't see him as well, it's more work but never underestimate them raiders... or griefers.
---
actually on PC I find myself running into more people lately than before. Just my little anecdotal evidence. 
---
Bethesda isn't cracking down on people using mods. If they were, there would be dozens of posts here and on the mod page about it.
---
I think there are more issues than the cap, certain cards feel like they are far too costly (5\* perk cards) or other cards that need to be switched in and out to be efficient are more of an annoyance to use. I'd like to see a general rebalancing of perk cards and perhaps 'passive' perks.
---
It should. It will have one legendary effect per star. 
---
Next update: fireproof nerfed. Developers saw it was almost needed to play with now, so they nerfed it so you can choose different cards.
---
This happened to me except it was one scorch beast and I was level 30. I somehow managed to kill it and wasted most of my ammo in the process.
---
Id rather do anything else than start a new character after i'd put in alot of work on my first, plus i rarely play multiple characters on any game it's just not me.
---
There you go, then. 
---
Bethesda talked about working on fixing this quite recently. Hopefully in the next patch it will be dealt with. I sympathize with you: I love the hell out of building stuff in this game and I'd be tremendously aggravated as well. 
---
I had them show up on a defend mission at the munitions factory. The moment I saw it was scorchbeasts attacking I just fast traveled away.
---
Who knew you could make high tier bosses a complete waste of time and resources.
---
At least Bethesda is drawing a good map of literally everything NOT to do when making a game.
---
Thanks.  I think that's great that you play with your folks and they are into games at that age.   That's awesome.  Thanks for sharing that. 
---
I still have a little hope that it gets better.  Bethesda was really slow with fixing Fallout 4 issues.  I remember that being almost unplayable for the first month because the bugs were so bad.  Even after their first major update that finally fixed a bunch of issues, there was still a lot of work to do.   Perhaps given some time they'll address these things on FO76.  I can only hope.
---
Shooting everything in the face is always a good thing haha
---
I “grief” but not obscenely (ie. i wont steal 9 fusion cores from you but I may steal 3 IF i need them).
---
but yeah, that blocking mechanism is straight cheese.
---
This needs to happen. I've disconnected three times now very shortly after launching a nuke, completely missing out on the blast zone that I had just created. Now I send out random team requests to everyone on my server so I can group up and hopefully rejoin when I get DC'd. 
---
I don't care if it changes the game.
---
If we had that many points we shouldn't even have perks or special as its mindless to make the same build as anyone else.
---
11 in every stat is stupid.
---
I shouldn't have said silly. 
---
I love the *Beowulf* reference with the Sons of Dane, I would consider that the “biggest” EE so far 
---
Agreed. I upgraded to shotgun turrets just to see if they were less worthless and I feel like I wasted my choice for a perk card.  By the time they actually start attacking, it’s too late and they’re destroyed 
---
I agree. However I think noPA should be viable 
---
Why removed?
---
? Really... Anyhow yes i did check multiple times before i've posted here.
---
They should have left PvP out of the game until the game was out of beta.
---
Yes, my question was will it do more damage if those 20% are based on say 200hp or 250hp. From the answers so far, it seems to make no difference. In conclusion it's an absolute value, not a relative one.
---
Two shot and twisted muscle accuracy drops arte not reflected in vats accuracy.
---
I know right? A nice trick to mess with a cranky home owner is to see if he/she left any workbenches near windows, if you activate them from outside you get teleported inside.
---
"You were too weak to defend yourself"
---
That's a bullshit argument and you know it.  The guy was well over level 100 and I still dropped him like a sack of fertilizer.  I had no warning. This wasn't PvP.  This was a single hit that did a massive amount of damage.  Please explain at what point I was supposed to defend myself?   When we was playing my instruments and looking around peacefully?  No.
---
No raiders in any Fallout game would instantly destroy half of your base in one hit.  Eat a bag of fertilizer.  Your excuses do not hold any water here.
---
Yes this is where the issues have occurred. 
---
Oh we can also have an inside the vault with a cool list about all things that have already been fixed ;) 
---
Solid effort at level 30!
---
I will absolutely read something positive (player interaction, gear CAMP design, easter eggs, etc) but the almost trite "I don't understand the whiners, this game is great!" posts are getting old. Awesome that you're having fun and not running into game breaking errors, but many many many of us are.
---
Steel is common as muck. Lead is your issue, tbh.
---
At this point I'm convinced that Bethesda really doesn't give a flying shit. 
---
Almost an entire 3 months in and the game has only gotten worse in many regards.
---
Good to know, but I have neither. 
---
In months of gameplay, I've only ever missed with 95% during severe lag or with two shot weapons, having lower accuracy by design.
---
you are fake news
---
I don’t buy it. They both have totally different bodies. And the skeever’s fur is 90% of its texture anyway. Could you show proof?
---
Bethesda: "Something that gives you an advantage? Better nerf it."
---
u/Ladydevann What this guy said \^
---
You will not see a roadmap. All of you need to realize that.
---
A roadmap, even if it were much more hopefully than accurate, would do the opposite of making people hang on. It would be nothing more than a notice of reinstall dates. 
---
Without them, they know you’ll keep playing under the delusional hope that a fix is “just around the corner”.
---
I agree.  We should be able to craft better turrets.  I don't care if the upgraded turrets take more rare materials to upgrade.
---
\+ Damage + Durability + Fire Rate + Detection Area
---
These are all things I want to make turrets at least marginally useful.
---
I can't wait until the PVP servers come in and everyone jumps on this bandwagon :)  Bases are pitifully easy to destroy right now.
---
Exactly.
---
Maybe add options to prevent the card clutter (ex. on Xbox RB to hide card/LB show hidden cards).
---
Which is not something I disagree with. If I were to structure my previous comment better, I would probably say that the results I personally achieved in 200 levels spent collecting plans, the ones that I actually like, use, and consider nice are mostly the ones I had to buy from vendors for caps, which make the act of searching for plans not relevanly rewarding, since the ultimate prizes are mostly achievable by grind followed by vendoring.
---
I dont understand why there arent still private beta servers like overwatch or league of legends or multiple other games have. 
---
Before introducing game changes and fixes, let active players test them out for a month, find bugs and fix things before they go live. It would stop so many of the complaints in the community and make patches a much smoother process. 
---
Probably a cave cricket steak.
---
What we have now is being exploited.  So one exploit is lost and another is added.   The end benefit is that someone won't be wanted for a single stray bullet.  Get over yourself. 
---
Lol no. But I'll take that as a compliment so +1 from me.
---
Sheesh. These duping accusations are really getting out of hand!
---
We need a team bounty.  If a member of your team is wanted each member should be  obviously flagged for pvp until the bounty is cleared or they leave the team.  Guilt by association.
---
Look at this dick head comment. Basic math genius would tell you that he’s write. If he’s playing 10 hours a day doing the optimal exp method and got to lvl 440, then someone who is level 700 would’ve had to play what, 16-18 hours a day to get to 700 legit. It’s just simply not possible.
---
Sorry you can’t do maths dickhead.
---
And springs. Not that I much care anymore as I stopped playing as the game actively made sure I had the least fun by throwing a ton of frictions as possible. 
---
Good luck!  My last achievement on xbox bugged out... the level 100 one.  I got every achievement but that one... I'm level 176.
---
One is probably not possible. The mod author stated the option had to be nested in a menu somewhere. He could change the menu it's in but the pipboy is probably the most convenient. It can't live on the main HUD for some reason.
---
Two is almost definitely impossible without a script extender which may not ever be developed for this game.
---
No thanks.  I will not be starting over in a new character in the PVP servers.
---
I already grinded TWO characters to 130 plus.  Now with the super nerfed XP and having to learn ALL of the plans I know over again, nope won't do it.
---
Just remember, the less people that join PVP servers, the less development money they'll put towards them.
---
What about a quest to learn how to fly a vertibird?  Can transport up to 3 other players ( copilot, and two side gunners?)  
---
Limit the amount of time one can fly, and or how often on can fly.
---
or maybe less players so less servers so the servers that are online are more full? 
---
I’ll put it like this here cap stashes map ?
---
( 20 hrs like vendors )
---
You think it is tough to explain that you've played just about every form of PvP there has been since the internet was dialup?   Work on your comprehension skills you dunning cow.
---
I did used to get quite a few server drops which I could have attributed to a poor network connection but I’ve not had that issue since the last patch. And I’m hardly on dial up.  Could be some lost packets using Wifi tho. Something to look at, thanks for the comment 
---
But none have refilled for me since the patch
---
But... explosives, and extreme prejudice, and extremely prejudiced explosives.
---
You're better off hoping around the ash heap region. Several locations, like the abandoned mines, have generators and cores laying around near those generators. You can easily get a lot more than 3 cores in half an hour, and easily get 3 in just a few minutes. Way less hassle than taking over a workshop.
---
Then you wouldn't say "is broke" . "is"  is present tense. You just say "broke"
---
Especially when I am in the mid 200s. I usually thank them after, which confuses them. 
---
Sorry to hear that! Post-nuke is definitely the easiest, when people are trying to offload all their loot.
---
Maybe, instead of saying they're bad, we should all make posts of how awesome they are, how we're having a shitload of fun being bombarded into blindness. 
---
The Bethesda fun police will notice and they'll nerf them in the next update!
---
Reverse psychology ftw!
---
Even for limbs are separate
---
Dropped one, bought one.
---
For the greater good. - The greater good!
---
(If anyone catches that reference.)
---
Oh crap that’s not good 
---
I get a kick out of the camp traps people design.   The one that made me laugh the most, to date, is the one where someone put a horn, and a switch.  The switch turns on the horn, making a loud noise that can be heard for a long ways.  People come to investigate the noise, they turn the horn off and then they proceed to look around...   
---
I haven't played since Earl December there is just nothing to do its a messed up game that doesn't seem to be getting better at all
---
All of them, I guess.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzUCbCIFhPo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzUCbCIFhPo)
---
Just saying...
---
There is usually a free fusion core on the desk next to the fusion core machine at the plant. Also I don't think taking any workshop is worth the time; you could scavenge far more resources and you are not stuck at one place taking out stuff from the extractors every 2 minutes.
---
You guys on now?  
---
Ha!  Protecting the train along the way from Scorched, Super Mutants, or marauding players...
---
Still need help ?
---
yes
---
Only bloodied melee, but then we’re both at the risk of a 1 shot. And a gamma gun haha good luck, I have radaway on my hot bar, I’ve ran around in nuke zones for 5 minutes in regular armor just spamming radaway and not dying.
---
Ultra3030 
---
Sending requests
---
Yeah we probably wont not all game studios care. Just a money grab. Wish they could all be more like Rare with weekly developer updates. Really the only reason I still hope over and play sea of thieves once in a while.
---
Yeah, I do a LOT of trading in the FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits.  It's starting to feel like a ghost town after patch 5.  Before there were nonstop posts and your post would get buried almost immediately.  Now it slowed way way down.
---
I even know a few player owned merchant stores.  All 3 of them have been permanently offline for about a week now.
---
I don't get it. 
---
We realized that people with melee builds felt COMPELLED to take perks like slugger, so we removed those cards from the game so you no longer feel you need to choose those cards!
---
You've cracked the formula haha
---
One gun army perk dude 12% stagger and limb cripple try it with a 50 cal they stagger they die
---
I'd propose a hardcore survival mode with no PvP limitations, no legendary effects, no fast travel, and you lose everything (or can lose everything) when you die. That way, Power Armor takes its rightful place as the Cadillac of armor but you've got to be careful with it. 
---
Fuck Dragons and Whoever Programmed them
---
You don’t care.  I guarantee someone at Bethesda cares about customer retention.
---
Yeah sure am
---
It was my impression that the Molemen predated the war, but were hidden deep in the mines.
---
When you are right, you're right.
---
good job !
---
Actually, I never implied that everyone agrees with me. The implication was that the people that are relatively happy with the game are not posting. It's been that way in the sales industry forever. The unhappy customer will *always* voice their complaints, while *most* happy customers will never say a word.
---
People that are stating that they have issues, have a right to make their voices heard.
---
I know 5 people in real life, plus myself, that bought Fallout 76. 
---
Only one of the 6 of us has quit the game and said it sucked. He quit at level 5.
---
Most of the rest of us have experienced at least one of the problems that people complain about, it's just not been to the point where we've thrown in the towel.
---
Last night, had one complete server kick for all of us. Hell, for all I know I caused that. I had not long before put a 10 mm pistol and 1500 or so rounds of ammunition in a desk in Flatwoods.
---
Had one occasion last night where I was invisible to one team mate and had to log off and rejoin to remedy that.
---
One of us occasionally gets what he calls the 'infinite loading screen'.
---
Bethesda really went out of their way to reward dupers and punish players who didn't buy or trade for dupes.
---
And yet, they show the crafted item as a picture of a PIE.
---
&gt;  "I don't understand the whiners, this game is great!" posts are getting old.
---
I agree they are getting old, just like the stash size increase posts, power armour re-naming posts ect  
---
Why would people stick around  this sub to be downvoted for liking the game and the only things posted are either people saying they quit or people asking for the same thing that has been asked for literally an hour earlier.  
---
I would have left this sub a long time ago but its a good place to get information on when new patches are released and its also the sub that Bethesda actually look at
---
I think it is a bug, it happens to me sometimes too. I just reenter vats and it corrects itself.
---
Also, the crafted item picture is of a PIE.
---
People will defend them and say you don't know how to kill them... even though you can see nothing on you screen but strobe light blue flashes. I think those people haven't experienced taking on three at once.
---
were coming now
---
I did a good level 130 ranged character that I eventually got a TSE for.  Bethesda Nuke Nerfed that guy to crap.  Not using him anymore.
---
My melee main is level 170.  Waiting for them to nuke nerf that next.
---
Not bringing up a 3rd character.  In Fallout when you get to "true end game status" you should feel and be POWERFUL.  That's the whole reason for playing the game.  Grind for levels, grind for perks, grind for legendaries, so you become the true wasteland warrior you were meant to be.
---
I'm not saying I never will buy atoms; if the shop prices become a bit more reasonable I'll probably drop some real cash to spruce up my camp. But so far I haven't seen enough stuff I *really* want to pay dollars for so the in game atoms have been enough. 
---
&gt;Then again, in the vein of immersion, why would a bot magically value our wrapped junk lol.
---
It's not that they value it because it's wrapped. The stuff that has to be bulked to sell is because it's base sell-value is less than 1 cap per piece. Bulked up, they can let you sell it for 8 caps per 10 pieces, or 11 caps per 15 pieces or whatever, but since they can't give you .8 caps for 1, they only let you sell it in multiples.
---
I’ll be joining in a few minutes GT: Manny Sandov , I’ll be online a few hours the usual nuke here ransack the vendors cap all over the map defend the workshop and help the fellow dweller 👍🏽
---
BoS vendor is in Watoga Shopping Plaza.
---
You have any clue how OP that would be? Adding another 26 SPECIAL points? Might as well just ask them to put the dev console back into the game.
---
You’re mistaking their words, I have yet to see them say this is a new dmg bug.
---
I keep stating this time and time again, I’ve got a bloodied pump that still puts out up to 600 dmg, and a bloodied powerfist that reads up to 2k(killed queen with it in less than a minute last night) and I have yet to see this new dmg bug happen.
---
The only time it appears that enemies are healing is when the server is lagging. I will ask a friend if they saw the enemies health go down and they did not, this means my client thought something happened but then the server immediately responded “it didn’t” and corrected the visual bug.
---
The only Brotherhood vendor is in Watoga at the Super Duper Mart.
---
The Brotherhood had Fort Defiance, Thunder Mountain Power, and Camp Venture when they all died.
---
Or when people use a niche initialise without defining. TRGMG. 
---
Hop around the Ash Heap region. Several locations, including the abandoned mines, have generators and a spare core laying around near them. You can get a decent haul pretty quickly. It's best to do just the mines as they're small, have few enemies, and getting to the generators is pretty quick and easy. You'll typically get a least one from each location, and and there's like 7 mines total. Doing all of them one can take you 10-20 minutes total, and you won't need cores for several days if you just use power armor.
---
Oh heck, I meant to replay to the wendigo that created this post lol, also joking reference for the order of mysteries 
---
Nerfed to oblivion and beyond. Melee is still OP as shit.. 
---
The BOS Vendor is located in Watoga, just north of the train station. In the Super Duper Market.
---
The only BoS vender is in Watoga
---
I dont like these people attacking low level players. In fact i did what you did and instead of getting one tapped by some dudes annoying duped explosive shotgun, i was able to kill those freaks and help the people at flatwoods.
---
But what were you doing in flatwoods?
---
I'd expect it to be in patch notes but aluminum and lead to be patched to not save weight anymore instead, then it never fixed :P
---
I'm running a one-handed melee / pistol build and I'm enjoying it only lvl 26 so not sure if it will work at later levels

Haven't done morgantown airport quest just wandering around trying to get to lvl 50 before doing the quests. having a blast

I like unarmed melee but I think that's because I'm not in PA

How about you can check a box to 100% opt out of survival.  (And PVP while you are at it).   FO4 had it.  
---
Not him.  The one that was a terminal inside a bunker.  
---
my friend is loading
---
Eew.  They did it in PHP.  Why not in Javascript so you could run it in your browser?
---
One of many frustrating quirks
---
I still have yet to see a thread about how much fun PvP is.
---
I know Bethesda really wants a piece of that Fortnite market but at some point you'd think they would scrap that idea.
---
Singing mole miners when anybody dies in the quest/event?
---
I agree there does need to be more draws to it, Fusion cores for instance last way way too long and allow people to live in power armour.  
---
If they make them die a lot quicker it would give them a lot of value and make the power stations with their core generators lots of value to take and hold.  
---
Obviously if they change this now all the people that live in PA will cry and complain that its more nerfs to make the game grindy ect ect as with what happens to everything now.
---
How cute, I’d love to see this instant death part you speak of
---
No.
---
I am thinking a script extender will be a 100% certainty given the preexisting modding community. 
---
I wonder about the menu nesting thing you mention though, I will have to read into that.
---
can't find gamertag
---
Only nuke Prime and Whitesprings.  Other places aren't even remotely worth it.
---
Prime you get the Queen, a few legendaries in the mobs, and all the violet flux you could possibly want.
---
Whitesprings you get a lot more legendaries (although a bunch of it is 1 star trash) and you can get every other type of flux.
---
Until they buff other zones with more legendary drops or boss creatures (like the SBQ), don't nuke anywhere else.  You won't get much, people leave the zone early (so no enemies respawn), and people will think "what idiot just nuked X?"
---
One of the seemingly few here who have enjoyed the game the whole time, but no I have not. And see no reason to, especially considering I earn plenty in game to buy something if I do want it.
---
and me, I'm sometimes right
---
You also have to consider that Bethesda Austin, formerly Battlecry, is new to this series and engine.  In most likelihood this game was started by Bethesda Softworks in Maryland and then gradually handed off to Bethesda Austin to manage and maintain, so that Beth in MD can continue on with future projects.  I am pretty sure that is where the disconnects are stemming from.  Hopefully Beth Austin can acclimate quickly and get a hold of things better in the future.
---
Lol uh, people with sentinel armor don’t run, it’s kinda the whole point of the armor
---
Do you know who had the vendor in the underground bunker.  It was a terminal inside an armory.  
---
The company is a joke
---
I've had scorch beasts just drop out of the air in front of me.  No one else around.  No gun fire.  I've seen various mobs spawn-die immediately.    For me, it seems to happen in batches.  When I see it once, then I see it again on the same server.   Otherwise I can go days or weeks without seeing it happen.   (I don't play ever day, so that can contribute to the sporadic nature as well.)   It seems like it is the specific session.  I do not know if it happens to other people during the same session or if it is a character bug as well.  I have a friend that was playing and it was happening to him one time and not to me.  That is why I wonder if it is also per character.
---
I would love this
---
That would be The Whitespring Bunker then.
---
Yeah i am really annoyed by it, the best part of the game was having people check out my camp with door switches, rad shower &amp; pet and all the amenities, and selling them Witches Costumes 
---
BethesGAY
---
The Enclave.
---
They're human miners who became irradiated and merged their DNA with mole rat DNA.
---
"We can't wait to tell you what's coming"...
---
Waits to tell us what's coming.
---
Only the slowest stay tbh
---
That wouldn't work because two players in cahoots like that don't have to be teammates.  The game sees them as total strangers to one another.  If one kills the other, the game can't tell if the system has been gamed.
---
You guys all set now?  Don't worry about the caps :)
---
Yes.. Because... Pvp ***IS*** bad... Just because you remove the word "is" and say it ironically it doesn't make it any less true.
---
But that's a lesson for a different time. 
---
The dev's only do what they are paid to do when they feel loved? Does that mean they don't get paid if people don't enjoy the beta?
---
Wonder how people's opinions would change if they released a working product?
---
What's baffling is that when turrets are featured in game they work really good... But somehow those in your CAMP are some cheap communist knockoff.
---
They refill, but I don't think they are guaranteed to have any caps.
---
So not only are they not guaranteed to be there, they seem to sometimes be empty...
---
Can't wait to see your CAMP in the game and blow it to shreds and take all your caps(and panties).
---
Thats it. Cant remember where the entrance is.
---
I consistently miss 3 95% shots in a row. This game is an absolute mess. It's stunning that they still focus on PvP when nobody cares about PvP and everything else in the game is broken.
---
Don't really get that issue on the pc. In a pretty big group and we don't see that issue ourselves! Check Bethesda's site if you need more help with your xbox
---
Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar.  You'll have to pay more caps for X01 mods, but it's worth the frustration of not having to server hop until you're bored to death :)
---
Shocks and Jetpacks generally go for 2k to 3k each.
---
Hope that helps!
---
thanks now it works, ill fast travel to you then sell me one cheap item for 200 caps
---
Squeaky wheel, my friend.
---
It's become painfully obvious that stash size is NOT the culprit behind server instability (recent duping "fix" plus what appears to be less populated servers with the same or greater lag/instability from my experience) but those posts haven't even gotten canned responses in a while. Yes, they are tedious and repetitive but outside of Bethesda actually ADDRESSING it in a non-vague or handwavy "looking into it in the future" way, it won't stop.
---
Similar with a mountain of other bugs and annoyances. While the nice "the dev team is looking into this" or "I'll pass this along to the team posts" felt very gratifying at first, it's sounding hollow now that we're getting new bugs, old bugs reintroduced and radio silence on actual substantive fixes, not to mention content.
---
We don't all look alike!
---
:p
---
Thats it.  Thank you.
---
Do the searchlights help?  I'd heard at one point they did...
---
It's by Whitesprings. Not sure the exact location, but I think it's a bit southeast.
---
The cost of the stuff in the shop is the only reason I haven't and likely won't buy any.  If the items you bought with Atoms had a more reasonable real-value-equivalent then I'd buy out the whole store and likely would keep doing so.  Like if a paint set covered ALL armor and was $5 or less, I'd do it.
---
Case in point, the Unstoppables stuff that came out recently.  To get the four costumes, the stash box, and the bed would cost you $50 real money.  Fifty fucking dollars for what amounts to one set of themed gear.  That's more than the game costs already.
---
I'm not a fan of the very public, cry for attention style of the posts, but the information contained in them is important. Bethesda needs this feedback, and they need it from as many players as possible. Much of the feedback overlaps, so the devs know what to prioritize.
---
If everyone just waited around for Bethesda to make the game fully based on their vision and didn't report certain bugs repeatedly, it would probably be a nightmare because these assholes are terrible at picking through available information without being tagged or barraged.
---
&gt; Bethesda removing servers / hardware? 
---
Bethesda don't have any hardware -- they use AWS.
---
I expect the number of instances to be scaled to the number of logins, that's the whole point of using something like AWS.  It seems they are making an effort to keep people on the same instance to make things more persistent.
---
That's the rub. Isn't it. We have to wait for new content and then likely wait a few months more for it to actually work.
---
There's a visual bug, where sometimes they still show as having no cap's, try selling something to one of them and see if it makes them refresh.
---
When I logged in, my base couldn't be placed and i didn't feel like jumping servers or paying to move it. I needed to do repairs on my weapons and couldn't remember which train station had a weapons bench, but I knew there were a couple in flatwoods. Also, if i pick up extra plans/recipes I like to leave them in the desk in  the desk at the church for other players. 
---
It is fairly ridiculous that screws are so rare considering the vast plethora everyone has in their garage at all times, and how nearly everything is held together by screws anyway. 
---
thoughts of betehsda: we must add more objects in the atomic store before fixing the game 
---
Lol, you go ahead and blame the customers rather than the janitor. 
---
This makes sense
---
See this is the issue, people like you come in here and spout your opinion as if anybody gives a shit.  
---
No-one cares about your opinion, no-one cares about my opinion, only difference is I dont go to sub of games I dont like and spout my opinion at those people
---
Nope. Not really. Whenever I log in I do stumble around people both in the world and always find a good chunk of people when I browse through the maps.
---
I haven't played in months, since there's no end game content.
---
- Gotta start releasing end game content. We like Fallout, but unfortunately there's nothing good to do after finishing the game.
---
- Definitely want to see free fast travel to train stations. This current fast travel system cost way too much. 
---
Except Gutsy. If you shoot him in the face he just laughs. A Gutsy's weak point is their thruster.
---
This is done way too many times. These people are never punished.
---
Had it happen to our team when they could stack explosive bobbleheads. We lost a lot more than caps.
---
Same. Where are dungeons. When can I use interesting builds and have them be viable? 
---
No you can do the same power station 3 times and get a random generator each time. I got all 3 from Poseidon 
---
Firebreather perk card and dense torso mod.
---
No problem. You're welcome!
---
Bethesda are under the impression that every one want's PVP :(
---
They couldn't be more disconnected from there player base / fan's if they tried :(
---
All I used to play for was lore and little stories, and after the few weeks I played at launch I haven't played again, since all I see about the game is that everything is broken all the time. 
---
I've played all the fallouts, completed 3, new vegas and 4 multiple times, played a few runs of the originals but I find it hard to get into them types of rpg's now. 
---
I got pa edition and love it for the big ornament that looks good in my office but apart from that I am done until its fixed and has a lot more to it. And I can imagine their are a shit load of people with the same mindset so imo the amount of people who are completely done with it is greater. I can imagine the people that bought regular edition are far more pissed off than me since I still got something out of it. 
---
Sometimes I feel like I should just go back to FO4
---
Anti armor + Furious and/or 90 weight rd
---
True that...hate that little bastard 
---
This is hilarious.... I literally said to a friend of mine last night.  The only thing making me want to delete this damned game was my constant hunt for screws and lead.  #FalloutScavengerHunt
---
he is not talking about the vendors
---
that's not how the real world works, not how it works at all. 
---
It gives it a sci-ruins vibe with everything floating. From that perspective, it's kinda cool.
---
Couple trips to the gym gives you all the lead you need. Steel is always my bottleneck.
---
If the fix the compass in power armor maybe.   If not you will be searching the wrong area forever.
---
&gt; so i don’t steal simply to amuse myself, it is tailored to the items i need at the time. if i have 9 full fusion cores in stash, then i do not steal from someone’s reactor.
---
Oh, so than what you said before wasn't true?
---
&gt; oh, i should have elaborated- i sit there and steal them to the point that when the other player returns there are none. lol
---
Hmm, so you're just saying conflicting things at this point. You already stated your goal in game was to frustrate people and provoke PvP.
---
&gt;server hopping sounds tremendously boring in the sense that a player can just go capture resources with very little to no adversity.
---
&gt;this game is specifically designed so that players may inhibit the progress of others.
---
This game is also specifically designed to make it so people can change servers, and also block you so you can't see what server they're on because you're inhibiting their enjoyment. Maybe you think it is boring that people don't want to engage with that, but other people probably find it boring to spend a lot of time on some dude who won't leave their workshop, and so they go do their resource gather elsewhere. To be clear, you're impeding somebody doing a chore. You're basically roleplaying as one of those guys that parks their trucks to block tesla charging stations so that electric cars can't use them, and then claiming it is boring if they go charge their car elsewhere instead of fighting with you.
---
Anyhow, I'm pretty bored with the conversation now, and have zero chance of meeting you in game so not much point in continuing this little chat. Peace.
---
thanks a lot:)
---
Usually i got to flatwoods to help out the newbies in there first even, fertile soil.  Its quite difficult but you can get the jist of it down.
---
Thanks. I tangled with one around level 30 (98 NAR during the Rose questline) and it was destroying me. Guess I haven't tried fighting one since.
---
That sounds nice. Every time I go there, everyone on the whole server is there camping the same places. 
---
It's the same reason something like the croquette mallet is only for one skin, so you can tell what it is and what sort of stats it probably has
---
Right. I hope if we keep asking maybe they'll hear us eventually.
---
The best photo of this week.
---
So all pvp is just bad, by default, and there's no point in trying to fix this pvp system?
---
What's the matter, little fella? Bad at video games?
---
I always thought they were just the dragons from Skyrim’s programming put into fallout
---
Could you please elaborate? I've taken time off this game since before these patches hoping they would fix the core game, so I'm not familiar with what you mean.
---
I’ve been noticing on PS4 that the worlds have more players in them. 
---
My instigating lever gun misses 95% shots consistently and my internet speed never drops below 100mbps.
---
I'm on PC......i7 with SLI GTX1080's and 16gb of ram.
---
LMAO.  You will probably never ventute too far from your parents basement.   
---
They've been a little dodgy, but I've been able to loot the same ones 3-4 times since patch/hotfix. Cap collector works too, albeit sometimes you have to back away from the container a good ways to get it to proc.
---
I haven't, simply because I haven't needed to. I've earned ample atoms simply by paying, and I bought all the stuff I wanted e.g. Vault-Tec Power Armor paint, fancy bed, plants, posters etc. 
---
200 is the lowest I've seen on xbox. 
---
I know that some of my gear is probably banned but I also know the people I got it from didn't dupe it they probably got it from someone who duped or someone who got it from someone who duped lol
---
What's the glitch with that?
---
Loved this story! 😀
---
I find ballistic fiber for sale at many vendors.  I usually just buy it.  You can find it at a number of military installations.
---
You can get better weapons by grinding for legendary ones.  Nuke Strike radioactive areas are a good place to farm legendaries.  It is hit or miss, but you'll eventually wind up with something decent.
---
Headshots:  Get the perk to do limb damage and if you can afford it, extra limb damage.   Sneaking Headshots are very helpful.  Melee is the most viable for damage output, but I still use guns to whittle the mobs down while they are running up to me.  When they get close, I switch to melee.   On PC you can switch weapons using the favorites wheel (assign weapons to favorites) and then use the numbers to switch to the weapon instantly without bringing up the favorites wheel.
---
Go to high level areas.  Tag the enemies from far away.  As long as you damage them, you get exp.  Stick around the higher level people and help them out.  Use power armor to defray damage and/or get the Marsupial mutation so that you can jump up out of range of most attacks, especially if you jump up onto a rooftop.
---
You can improve your armor or your power armor with mods.  Getting the perks to craft those is another thing to consider.  Make friends / play with others / in teams.  That helps a lot too.   
---
dope picture
---
I recently preordered far cry new dawn and may take a look at anthem. Love my fallout but the bugs and content(nerfs) make me a bit crabby. Lol. Hopefully they get some stuff going because more games are being released and players are going to evaporate. C'mon Bethesda, get your shit together!!
---
I just had hemlock holes maintenance last night. The turrets on the ground did not do as well as the mounted ones.
---
what did you change? I am on shotgun now, but have ammo problems, and read about white knight nervs etc.
---
Try taking addictol. Sometimes addictions don't show up in effects, but you may be suffering from them anyway.
---
i'm not opposed to buying atoms if/when it becomes necessary but tbh, i haven't really seen anything that i desperately wanted. I have like 3500 atoms saved up from completing challenges i didnt even know i was doing so i might go get the camo pa skin so it's less obvious when i put my T60 legs on my X01 suit, lol. 
---
I know people trash lootboxes but i would be far more likely to buy loot boxes with randomized shop stuff if they were like a buck. I have spent a fair amount of cash on OW lootboxes and i don't even play any more. 
---
Yeah, once I crafted max level Excavator PA and X-01, and stopped crafting/upgrading weapons while leveling up, I haven't had a big sink for screws. My weapons don't need them for repairs, and I almost never have to repair my PA. At least screws weigh 0.03 instead of 0.1 like most other junk so I'm not wasting too much space hording them, but once I hit 400 I stopped tracking them.
---
 And yet I have well over 400 hours in this one, Know the game pretty well at this point with 2 over 50 level chars.
---
 I have thousands of hours into Fallout 3D games. Have never used VATs and can dominate any of em' on the hardest setting. I have been playing video games since Doom and have nearly 80 games on Steam.
---
 The real world is not what you care about. Sturm and drang is what you seem to love. Look it up puppy.
---
I am totally with you
---
Interestingly.....i only had to repair my fusion gen, one roof panel, one lamp.   Not bad really.
---
Clearing it gives you 20 caps, 25 to take it and you get some random stuff from taking it worth more than the cost to take it.  Unless you mean to get there... you still are at about zero caps loss if you sell the stuff you get from the event.
---
I am one of the people that do not play so much anymore. I am one of the people waiting for survival mode and I certainly do not want them to ditch it. I tried playing last night with a friend and was turned off by the bugs not the content. I enjoy running around the wasteland with other players and that is what the game was designed for. I could do with more content sure...but single player content isnt what I am looking for in 76. I am looking for the emergent content. Once they get the crap fest of bugs under control and get a real survival mode going ill be a lot happier with the game. Until then ill log in sometimes to vendor and scream at people to give me drugs until they hate me, as I am some of that emergent content I mentioned before.
---
I do that, too. I’m 295ish and frequent Flatwoods all the time, mostly to help new people. I really like to help new players, and I’m reeeeally not into pvp. Griefing play makes me nauseated. Also, there are a lot of Brahmin there near the church for making Ribeye Steaks, and that stream that goes all the way north and past the Overseer’s Camp is thick with glowing fungus for harvesting. I craft way too much...
---
Nah, people leaving the game doesn't stop them from coming here and still bitching about it ;) 
---
Yep that did it, thanks! It didn’t show me any addictions, indeed.
---
I've completely avoided contact with them. The only time i do is when theres a group of people taking one down or during the Scorched Earth event, otherwise i'll just ignore them and avoid them as much as possible. Waste of ammo and stims 
---
They should have launched with a coop mode and promised a PVP dedicated server system later. I honestly believe their balance issues are all PVP driven and are screwing up the PVE experience. 
---
I limit myself to one weapon buy for scrapping for mods, per day. That way I can still make a couple impulse buys and still come up positive on cap gain if I only sell to the vendors for caps that day.
---
Then I only build one gun or two to scrap per day as well. Unless I feel like doing nothing but scavenging for screws that day.
---
Lol have you not seen what’s been happening with them false advertising merchandise? I mean hell fallout76 was basically a reskinned fallout 4 cash grab.
---
They copied so much code from fallout 4 that even the bugs in that game are in fallout 76 too.
---
And you want to talk about Bethesda caring about customer retention. 
---
ouch
---
Your wise statement leads me to believe that you have also communed with the Wise Mothman!!
---
Tin cans and combination wrenches give both, I never drop/sell those when I pick them up.
---
Yeah, but for PS4.
---
Xbox player.... I actually recently made a group of friends that I link up with every few days or so in the evening.  About 6-7 people (wish we could make bigger teams!)
---
I keep seeing other dots on the map as well and dropped some supplies for some baby players too. 
---
So for those that are playing still, has activity seemed to drop off?  Still as many people nuking before the last nerfs?  I had stopped over a month ago, and my kid after the last nerf.   I took the opportunity to re-visit Fallout 4, I re-installed for both him and I FO4 with the complete mod list here: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/23556/?tab=description
---
It took a few hours to do, and allot of downloading, but holy crap it is awesome! After replaying FO4 with all these mods, it really is clear how bad Fallout 76 is now to me and my kid.   I think allot will need to change to bring either of us back again.
---
A literal cancerous spam
---
That's true, cause those ppl actually want the game to be better. It's way worse when ppl don't even care anymore. 
---
I might spend money on atom shop items if they doubled the budgets for camps.  Whats the point buying items you cant use?
---
Yeah, been crafting and breaking down those lately to try to get mod plans. Play for two hours... Make three guns 😢
---
LOL. My friend found one set like on the third try. He bought it for me because he didn't have X-01 armor yet. We've both been on the hunt for more ever since. He should have bought a lottery ticket that day while he was at it.
---
Meanwhile I'm running around nuke zones picking up fauna and mass trying to gather enough of this violet flux bullshit to make them for some T-51b legs I found. Thanks for making everything a tedious grind because you have no content, Bethesda.
---
You have put a lot of thought into this and it is much appreciated. I hope this is a sign of some DLC content around the cult(s).
---
They nerfed TS and Explosive individually which destroyed the weapons that people got as legitimate drops.
---
Duped TSE weapons are still some of the best in game and to top that off they made TSE unavailable on future drops for the cryolator and pyrolator.......thereby rewarding the cheats who duped or bought these weapons with legacy weapons that non dupers will now never be able to obtain.
---
Try doing a nuke launch, have it crash half way. Then have to start over from the beginning. 
---
Or Heart of the Enemy that crashes every time you fast travel to VTU forcing you to start the quest from the beginning.
---
Yesterday many defend events were spawning enemy’s under the ground making it impossible to finish the quest.
---
I love the game Also but they have many bugs for a AAA game priced has high as it was. 
---
The HUD and the constant noise and the head bob. The change in power armor from 3/NV to 4 is fucking awesome but I still find it incredibly annoying to use.
---
Sorry but that’s a terrible idea, not trying to be rude but that’s just my opinion. 
---
And the second problem is that you don't know where to put all the ammunition...
---
+1
---
I don't like this idea. I feel like it breaks emersion. All of these train stations are mostly destroyed and busted. Perhaps, if Bethesda introduced new quest lines to repair/restore the train stations to build your own "phased" train stations that had special vendors and could allow you to fast travel between said stations that have been repaired.
---
Godamnit they screwed up the ONE best source of plastic. I just realized this after coming back from Camden and Dirt track just to collect plastic scrap.  It’s little things like this that burn my ass about this game. 
---
True, if anything the dupers have shown that the servers will continue to run even with them running about with millions of carry weight, which means from the 24 people per server, we could each have almost 42,000 stash size to equal 1 duper running about with 1 million weight.  
---
Now I dont disagree with the posts, I do want stash increased, I want what most of the people post about, but bethesda are also aware of them and that we want them, so it just beating a dead horse really, theyve said they will be increasing the stash in the future, now we just have to be patient
---
Ha. I had the 3 scorchbeast defense once and it was on a random crap workshop that had nothing valuable even except for a junk pile that I was there for. I think it rolls randomly on a table. 
---
Was it a fresh nuke?  I notice people tend to swarm when the bomb is first dropped, but after 45 minutes or so pretty much everyone leaves.
---
We will find out soon enough with the launches in February. Right now, if they don’t launch new content until mid March and if it’s just a PVP hardcore mode, then the game will lose a majority of its players. 
---
The ones at blackwater mine, roof at whitesprings, and one inside whitesprings bunker and a few others have not refilled since i looted them patch day.  Cap collector worked on them at thag time
---
That could definitely be the case. I'm sure eventually modders will fix this for PC, but console folks will be sol.
---
Have you added spotlights to your camp? Even in the day time it seems that my turrets are actually useful once I added a few powered spotlights. I was even able to reduce the total number of turrets I have after adding them. 
---
Also latency + wings flapping = fuck your bullets
---
Thank you! I'm really intrigued by the "emanating" shrines. I think it was quietly introduced on the last update. Maybe a hint for things to come... ^_^
---
I had that many before I started crafting handmade,  lever action, and gamma guns for the mods. Now I'm ecstatic when I can manage to scrounge 20 together to make *two* guns.
---
I will be one of the first to still try to defend this game but man, fuck Scorchbeasts.  This is what everyone who plays this game can unite behind.  Fuck 'em.
---
First I really thought Scorchbeasts would only appear near fissure sites, so I naturally avoided getting too close. But as I leveled up they randomly started to appear everywhere, and when I finally was able to kill one (with a help of a assaultron that was trying to kill me before)  IT JUST RESPAWNED in less than 2 minutes. I still haven't returned there to complete the quest (find the transponders around Watoga), too many Scorchbeasts and the quest is one of those you have to start all over again when you die. 
---
Let's see your math.
---
Damn, you nailed the puns! ^Oh^wait
---
Wow. Hopped 3x today and didn't get it but did get the Stealth Boy mod. Never saw that one before. Yesterday I got the Headlamp Bright mod. That seems to show up 1 out of 5 hops.
---
I still see it happen, but you're right about it not being as common.
---
I believe you. I was asking the question about camps, the only point I was making is that he definitely couldn't harm you while it was on.
---
I suppose it stops people griefing with structures, but it does suck that it doesn't stop you being griefed. It's easier to leave a server with a swastika built on it or a path blocked than it is to rebuild because someone decided to burn your home to the ground. 
---
Balance? What's balance? 
---
I play less and less because once you finish the overseer questline, the enclave questline, the responder questline, the firebreather questline, and the BOS questline, dropped a nuke, etc (I could be forgetting something and a few of these could barely be called questline), the game doesn't quite have the replayability of other Fallouts. I could start an alt, but I haven't felt like it. I still have some exploring to do so I still play a bit, but I'll hit it hardcore when something else is opened up. I need more single player content than I do pvp. 
---
I have a legacy explosive cryolator and it’s still pretty solid. Not a two shot but still does pretty good damage.
---
TSE weapons got nerfed hard but they were honestly super overpowered before. The nerf to two shot might have been a bit too much though.  
---
You'd need a Mr. Handy Buzz Blade to cut through that stuff. Lean. 
---
Lol they LITERALLY copied and pasted the dragons from Skyrim.Not joking.It even says it in the name of the file lmao.Such laziness from Bugthestard....
---
Hi
---
Thanks for answering so fast, but i'm talking about the caps stashes :) 
---
Where do I learn that mod? 
---
It's obvious they rushed to try and get in on the Fortnite action.
---
PvP shouldn't have been included in this game until they eliminated all of the bugs and exploits.
---
Those that taste yummy and those that don't?   
---
Not a fan of stringy...

someone mentioned crafting ultracite fusion cores from near depleted cores, they were waiting for the core to go down to 1% then creating an ultracite fusion core which was full after crafting and then using superduper as well  
---
I try to, haha.
---
Seems I always either run out of gunpowder or steel. Never both.
---
You're smoking crack if you think the first version of FF14 wasn't as bad as this. It was WORSE. It was gd horrible and they had to pull the game down to rebuild it almost entirely from the ground up because it was just that unplayable.
---
FO76 has had plenty of bug and performance issues but it is largely playable. The people who scream about design choices aren't talking about objective problems, they're just unhappy the game doesn't reflect their own desires.
---
This is a great idea except for the servers and individual player progress, which means maybe you've done this, but how do you maintain it? As in, say the game crashes or you get bumped from the server, when you relog, after you've finished that quest line, you'd have to re do those quests, because finishing then would affect that particular works, wouldn't it? I don't have technical experience not am I saying I'm an expert. 
---
You guys are the real MVP! The only thing is I'm on ps4 😥
---
That’s the thing. It just doesn’t have any quests that are interesting imo. Every quest is essentially just reading terminals, find hollow tapes to put in terminals, and killing unrewarding enemies, idk having no factions to choose from or even fight against made me realize that NPCs actually play a huge part in the overall quality of the story which (to me) has been the best part of fallout. 
---
76 is just bad as far as the story/variety. I’m sure when you restarted new Vegas you played an entirely different game practically, it felt fresh and new, but with fo76 there’s nothing to really replay because there’s no variety everyone plays the same game. And it sucks because when I first started playing I really liked it and I even defended it against unnecessary hate but eventually I realized that the critiques are pretty legitimate. 
---
Good news is the story can be fixed by a good dlc and I’m sure survival mode will help reduce the amount of “griefing” in adventure mode. The weapons and all the other bugs wouldn’t matter as much (to me) if there was an actual story worth caring about 
---
Damn, that's some serious damage. I mainly use this build just because I love good old 50 lol. I'm glad they didn't screw her up so much as they did with poor MG42
---
Maybe more options to do with the cards:
---
* Ability to downgrade. i.e. break a level 3 into a level 1 and a level 2 card.  Some of us upgraded too early.
---
* Respec Options:  After level 50 you can do the choice of 1 card or move one point, but also, at any time (after 50) you can sacrifice a card for ability to move one point. Maybe through a workbench.
---
 * 1 point per level of card. i.e. level 3 card 3 points, level 5 card 5 points.  This would be a good way for us to be able to get rid of unused / duplicate cards.

In Fallout 3, Mirelurk meat had greater restorative properties than other meats so I always assumed it was tastier. 
---
Actually, was just watching a video last night about the group that has, more or less gotten multiplayer, to work in Skyrim. Maybe FO4 should be their next project :-)
---
Yes and now doubling down on pvp is just asinine. 
---
I haven't played in about 4 days after I got the last two achievements on Xbox.
---
Otherwise, I have more than 250 hours in game and two characters that have done just about everything in game.  
---
Tin foil hat time: Perhaps there was a higher than normal turnover in their programmers and those that intimately understood the engine have left. It is hard to dive into someone else’s code and untwist everything if you are new. That’s all I can figure for the one step forward, seven step backwards bug fixes.
---
Like you, I haven't really noticed any decline and in fact, I saw three level ones yesterday coming out of Vault 76.
---
I did a SBQ and Whitespring Nuke zones yesterday and both were with plenty of activity.
---
I'm not sure about that - I've left stuff in either the luggage, trash cans, cigarette machines, etc at train stations and come back hours later and it is still there.  Sometimes some of it is missing, or there's different amounts of stuff - people come and drop what they don't want and add to it - kind of a "take a penny - leave a penny" dish at the convenience store.
---
Whenever I take a workshop, I try to find a container that is part of the scenery and I usually put a cardboard standup vault boy pointing at it - I have the small letters, so I usually put a sign on it that says "free stuff"  and I dump known plans, extra junk, unneeded ammo, etc in it.  Often I'll come back and find that someone has come by and taken advantage of it and dropped some of *their* known plans in the box.
---
Strangely they say it's not acceptable currency, but still buy my "Iguana on a stick.."
---
 The are 3 entrances. The Bunker Entrance, the door at the Service Entrance and the semi  secret door upstairs in The Whitespring
---
I usually do Whitesprings roof, bunker, then Poseidon Energy. Just did all of those last night in fact. They all worked, and they all proc'd Cap Collector too. Not too sure what's causing that for you, as they're supposed to be instanced like most containers now if I'm understanding it correctly. I even got the one behind the lockpick 3 door in the lobby last night, and someone had obviously been there before me as the door was wide open and didn't require me to pick the lock.
---
I forgot about that nonsense. Unless they take it tongue in cheek and make Protectron's head as part of the train, with a cheesy line of dialogue. 
---
Yes, but the guns themselves aren't that great.  
---
The only two turrets worth having are Rockets and Heavy Lasers, and even then, it's pretty sketchy. 
---
 I mean, if it helps you sleep at night to pretend everyone is lying and the bad reviews this game got and all the forum posts are actors and all the deep discount sales this game got are just photoshops and the majority of people actually love this game then go ahead, but why not face reality that you like an unpopular game? instead of pretending you are some secret majority thing?
---
Abandoned Bog Town has an office building that has a 3rd floor I access via a hole in the ceiling of the 2nd floor. There are like 8 typewriters and some globes in there, quite a haul
---
Right? I can carry it with some perks, but I sure as heck can't store it because my stash is maxed with cool stuff I can't seem to part with...
---
This x 800000, how the hell is this not a thing yet. And you’re telling me it take like 30 springs to fix my PA legs, but I don’t get any back?? Huh?
---
ah, i steal them so there is none in the fusion reactor but leave em in a bag. i really didnt explain that, sorry. i drop em in front of the reactor and if the player gets em, great. if not, also great. usually how this plays out- we PvP, someone dies, if it’s the shop owner they always seek revenge, once they get sick of it we do the wave thing and then i drop the cores. i have even followed players across servers to give them their cores. 100% of the time they do exactly as u suggest- they setup again on a new server. 9/10 i get the players their cores back and we do the thumbs up thing. ive had other players decimate
---
my camp and then drop tons of junk, i assume
---
so that i may rebuild. i have found “griefers” that show some hood sportsmanlike conduct.
---
BUT... i am going to reflect on what you said- that i’m impeding a chore. i can think of a handful
---
of chores ive performed on FO76 and i did not enjoy them. also, your analogy regarding trucks and charging stations... i 100% agree with you and now i am considering adjusting my gameplay. maybe steal just a little bit, leave the rest and then just fire shots to engage PvP. 
---
your truck analogy really puts into perspective how others perceive the game and yeah, i dont want to be that guy. excellent point, i will admit
---
my folly.
---
Once you get to be a certain level it seems like screws accumulate. I have 800 in my stash and drop hundreds at a time for friends
---
I've been playing other things. I'll log back in when there is more to do. I was hoping for new content by now, but I'd be surprised to see anything before Survival mode drops.
---
The scorched are fine. It's everything else.
---
Yeah my bad :(
---
Stashes seem to work on there own schedule since they've changed it :/ Not collected enough of them to know timers etc hope you get the answers you're looking for though!
---
You should...FO4 is a great game. If you are not enjoying this game stop playing it
---
Six days since the last Inside the Vault and a little over a week since the last patch, someone contact the UN and report a human rights violation. They've been releasing patches every other week for what, two months now? And even at that rate you bitches cry that they're not fixing enough at a time or that the patches are too buggy and yet you want them to push them out even faster now? 
---
Someone said in a different post yesterday that Bethesda changed things so that to consistently get a fresh server you had to entirely quit the game and bring it back up again. The reason the poster gave was to discourage server-hopping and he claimed it was in previous patch notes, but I don't recall every reading anything about it.
---
I spend more time in discord or market than FO76.  Great end game.
---
Every type of chest piece.
---
I mean... Properly commenting your code goes a hell of a long way but you are right about it being hard to work on someone else's pile...
---
I agree that actual disconnects are less frequent, but I'm seeing severe lag, even in barren areas without other players or enemy hordes. Loading in and out of buildings seems to take much longer as well.
---
Bethesda! Granny Panties in the Atom Store!
---
You just saw it, I estimated it in about 2 seconds
---
Oh they kill the crap out of them but when you drop 15-20 of them in random spots they can't carpet bomb the area and bulk kill the turrets. Then you just run around fixing/scrapping them as they go down
---
Yikes imagine if they listen to those guy.
---
100? FO3 had a cap of 20 or 30 with DLC.
---
LOL you're funny. The whole point is that if it takes 10 screws to make something and you are supposed to get half the mats back when you scrap it, you should get at least a few screws when you scrap said item. 
---
But really though, I would think there would be enough people in the office that have worked with this engine for long enough to know a thing or two.
---
I like path of exile. Cause it has an EXTENSIVE skill tree. And you can obtain a specific ingame currency that gives you a respec point. Which is just the ability to move a skill point. If you have 10 you can move 10 skill points etc etc. but the beautiful thing is the game has league/season play, and when the league/season is over, the game offers a FULL character respec when your character moves back to the standard game. It’s beautiful because a character I haven’t played on 5 seasons is still lvl 100 but I can now respec and have my lvl 100 character become something completely new.
---
Probably shouldn't have launched it with a AAA price if that was the case hey :)
---
FTP or an actual ALPHA / BETA would have stopped this mess.
---
If a change is made to how perk cards are managed, please please please just add the functionality of [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124). That would make deleting/hiding/discarding unwanted perk cards mostly moot, because you'd only ever have to go through the trouble of rifling through all your cards once when creating a loadout.
---
Yeah I know, I have clocked in my fair share of hours into FO4.  It's not that I don't enjoy FO76 -- it's a love and hate relationship though.
---
Well....  
---
One can hope the two missteps results in a higher level of quality control and less kneejerk rushing.  
---
Personally I'd like to see them roll back all of Jan and start fresh.
---
 The Atom drops are a bit strange. I will never buy any BTW. It will give me about 50 for a solo Scorchbeast kill but only about 10 for a group effort on 3 high level ones. Seems a bit skewed.
---
Then the player base and fans should have sent a message by not preordering a game that had been advertised as having ‘always-on PvP’.
---
Because in the state its in now PvP is not fun. I personally hope they make the survival mode PvP right this time around. 
---
I've had this happen to a ghoul at Berkley springs.  The irony of getting orbitally strikes by a can of dog food.
---
I thought they listed every mod or plan you can have now so that you don't have to any more World hop? Are you telling me that you can't actually crap that yourself?
---
That’s wild man, I need to repair my decontamination shower after a few mole rat run ins
---
Should be allowed to but you should have to on the correct line
---
It was dark. At one time near release if you build a little shack it was literally pitch black inside, so you had to add a light bulb. I loved that. And for some reason they made night time as bright as day time. No difference now. Doesn't make any sense to me and spoils a lot about night time perks and items etc. and also mood lighting and all the cool lighting items they have, made insignificant.
---
Sorry man, that always makes me mad...
---
I HIGHLY suspect its the water purifiers, followed by the concrete walls and then crops. The purifiers are pretty big detailed models. Defense walls are also unusually high in budget and they really don't work well anyway. Wood foundations are also somewhat large, concrete foundations are a lot less. Walls and floors are pretty low, roofs are a little higher (maybe 1.5x floors). Lights aren't actually that bad. 
---
By comparison, my train station camp was 4x3, one of each crafting station except power armor, fusion generator, 1 bed, a bunch of power connectors, 15 lights or so, 25 crops, 2 small water purifiers and no turrets, but was about 70% of my budget. 
---

---
Level 25 at time of construction so level shouldn't be an issue. 
---
They haven't been 'a colossal disaster'. I wasn't affected in ANY significant way by the screw-ups of the last patch and continued to do exactly what I was doing prior to the update. Most people are in the same position. 
---
You and the folks giving you upvotes are just sensitive and self-indulgent and you get emotional then exaggerate when something doesn't go as perfectly as you expected. I don't know how you survive in the real world with this kind of attitude because problems are quite common in life and in the workforce and fixing them/being positive is the mature response.
---
Maybe not everyone but a lot of people do. Everyone I play with wants it. 
---
Are people actually spending real money to buy Atom points? I really hope not. I've been tempted, but I'm waiting to see if they fix the game first.
---
You were able to kill him, right? So you lost your base to someone, what do you want the outcome to be. You want to make him hurt as much as he hurt you?
---
Stealth boy seemed as rare (I purchase )as calibrated shock , unfortunately I can’t have both on :(
---
To be fair, I paid my money for this game, so I want to give it a chance, and again, I'd be happy with team PVE. I'm not even saying get rid of PVP altogether, just give them their own sandbox to murder in. 
---
Its just fine. I do enjoy the churn though.
---
A: you don’t know the state of the game because the demo was a build that was almost 2 months behind the final product.
---
B: “release the game in this poor of a state”... they haven’t released the game yet. What are you basing this opinion on? 
---
It's a hell of a lot of fun to teleport back to your base just to do some quick stashing and crafting only to find not one, not two, but three fucking SBs there barraging not just your base but your ears with non stop screeching.
---
I've also seen three SBs flying ass to mouth across cranberry bog.
---
Both times I DCed immediately.  Nobody wants to deal with that.
---
Don't enter power armor then.
---

I have seen many people suggest this, but your idea provides a lot more of the "how" it would work. I hope Bethesda sees this!
---
tested and nope, can't do it anymore. Which, I suppose, makes more sense since my mouth is enclosed in a helmet.
---
Looking at the loudest bitching. Do they? Cause it doesn't seem like it. 
---
"We have a lot of bug fixes, new PvE content, end game content and buffs to lazer/heavy weapons coming in the near future!"
---
"For now we have noticed some necessary balance changes required."
---
"We have now nerfed melee, nerfed bloodied, nerfed furious, nerfed Super Duper, increased costs of repair of both armour, weapons and power armour to even the playing field, compared to players who choose to play the game naked."
---
"We also have noticed that durability issues have been a big issue for the player base, brought up at least once a day on the subreddit. So we have lower durability of everything, to really bring that post apocalyptic challenge to the game."
---
😑
---
There are a bunch of \[related posts up\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ankly2/pacifist\_mode\_is\_a\_joke\_greifing\_is\_apparently/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ankly2/pacifist_mode_is_a_joke_greifing_is_apparently/)), between the back to back broken patches, unannounced major nerfs (Weight hit me especially hard)...  
---
In the 4 hours I've logged in since Tuesday's patch, I have seen and experienced more griefing than in my 400+++ hours in '76 combined..
---
I did this with FO3 just to make sure I could get the perks I wanted. This is not new.
---
 It excited children mostly. I rather enjoy it.
---
When they fix the ammo consumption/creation issue, they might be good. Until then, you can farm for days and craft with all the right perks to run the weapon for about 5 minutes.
---
So that's what did it, been wondering why they no longer bother me, previously had to jump into my PA every time one discovered me, but then all of the sudden I realized it doesn't do anything but make them hard to hit.
---
Killing them is another issue, since they nerfed all my ranged weapons, I just try to avoid them when possible, loot isn't worth the ammo required to kill them.
---
God you're whiny. 
---
Or I was giving constructive feedback in a light-hearted manner, and then resorted to simple mockery when I realized that you are a person whose pride is more important to him than bettering his communication skills. 
---
But I'm glad to see you can actually manage to summarize, even if you fail to realize that the point in writing is communication and the point of TL;DR's is a quick summary for people that don't want to read a wall of text. If you present them with another wall of text, they will not read that either. I still don't know what this post is about. 
---
So, I guess the question becomes, why even make the post if you don't *really* care if the message is communicated? 
---
Containers dont refill for me either
---
Where???
---
My friends and I have left with plans to return when either the game is playable or private servers are up. There just isn't enough content to keep things engaging. 
---
Compare that with something like, Final Fantasy 14, a game that adds new content every quarter, and I wonder what is going on.
---
I like the idea of a mole miner NPC along the lines of Grahm - maybe a mole miner that hasn't completely lost his mind yet
---
suggest the team allow us to custom sort.
---
Are people suppose to take this? Banned indefinitely without response?  Not good enough after all we put up with 
---
I’m still surprised respecs weren’t in the atom shop lol. 
---
It's already lost a large number of players that they're not getting back though.  
---
I'm curious to see out of all the problems answered "oh by golly gosh I'll be sure to pass this info along blah blah" how many are actually 100% fixed.  
---
I got off for a few days around mid-December, haven't really gone back much since. One time I did a couple weeks ago, got insta-killed in pacifist mode by some dupers, and haven't been on since.
---
I only want this game to get out of alpha.
---
Topic gave me an idea [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ansr5q/train\_station\_fast\_travel\_idea/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ansr5q/train_station_fast_travel_idea/)
---
I really do think PvP in this world could be a fantastic experience but I also feel strongly that in order for that to happen, you've got to remove the magical elements from weapons and armor. Not just nerf them, remove them. I've seen nothing, not one single thing so far that makes me think Bethesda will ever be up to the task of balancing the legendary effects of the various weapons and armor. Leave that stuff in the vanilla experience, that's great, no problem with that.
---
But what I'd propose is a hardcore mode featuring:
---
Significantly denser populations on servers, and even build permanence
---
Clans
---
No legendary effects on anything, and no mutations
---
Hardcore, as in, everything you're carrying goes in a bag when you die and you might lose it all. Keep the stash though. 
---
No PvP restrictions, no bounties or slaps.
---
I understand this is not what a lot of people would want and that's fine, I respect that. I'm just asking Bethesda for the chance to create a little of our own fun, to engage in our own world building. Vanilla will always be there for folks who just want to farm whitespring. 
---
Perk Loadout Manager just needs to be integrated into the base game. No more fiddling with perks one at a time.
---
I'd rather they disabled PvP until they can fix all of the bugs, glitches, exploits, and server instability issues.
---
You can't nerf and rebalance weapons and armor while you already have dozens of bugs. They just keep introducing more bugs and glitches.
---
When I run along the tracks, though, they are either littered with wrecked trains, or in the case of the aerial segments,  completely collapsed.
---
I would think that before allowing free fast travel, those clear impediments to rail travel would need to be replaced, and ideally even then they should be subject to scorched attacks re-ruining them.
---
This could be woven in to the "rebuilding" theme, but at the same time would need to be challenging while not making doing so a pointless endeavor.
---
Thumbs up for this post.
---
I am a level 107 on the PS4 and routinely go out of my way to give low level players a stimpak or purified water. Last night I helped kill a few ghouls chasing another player who was running for his life.
---
Actions like these promote a friendly culture within the community and despite all the issues we have with this game, being someone who helps sure isn't going to hurt in the long run.
---
There are a bunch of [related posts up](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ankly2/pacifist_mode_is_a_joke_greifing_is_apparently/), between the back to back broken patches, unannounced major nerfs (Weight hit me especially hard)... (Quoting myself)
---
&gt;I think '76 is down to the "filthy casuals" and the griefers ATM.  
---
&gt;Since last Tuesday's patch the number of people online has, in general plummeted.  
---
&gt;Not hate, observation substantiated by the drop in Reddit activity and many people seeing ghost-town level friends list activity.  
---
&gt;The point?  
---
&gt;In the 4 hours I've logged in since Tuesday's patch, I have seen and experienced more griefing than in my 400+++ hours in '76 combined..
---
I'm sorry to hear that, I was quite a fan of shotguns
---
I see! Thank you :)
---
Remove legendary effects from the PvP mode, and buff damage from explosive and energy weapons would be a good place to start imo
---
Tried multiple servers I'm assuming?
---
Yo OP here just dropping in to say thanks for being cordial to one another, seems like a lot of people have similar frustrations. I think that we should make more discussions like these in the sub to let Bethesda know that:
---
 1) people are leaving and somewhat dissatisfied 2) we (well most of us) still want to play and enjoy the game. 
---
Hopefully if we’re constructive instead of combative Bethesda will answer our pleas. 
---
Well yeah you built it out of beer bottles, telephones and soup cans.
---
I mean it's not like it's literally their job or anything. Nonono they have to feel the "love" lol. 
---
I've not even spent the 5K+ Free Atoms I have earned until the game is stable.
---
How about unban your player basis first 
---
Good god the whining in this sub is almost never-ending now. xD
---
If your turrets kill something? That's a bold assumption you have here!
---
I have tons of gears and springs but screws are like either I go out of my way to get them or I go around finding like 2 or 3 
---
Ok.
---
Let's see it.
---
There have been a ton of bug fixes and minor QOL tweaks since the first week. So that is probably what you noticed. 
---
Also, every game is fun with friends.
---
That would be pretty shitty of them, considering everything up to this point. I’d understand for Caps. 
---
I think it was SWTOR that charged you a certain amount of caps the first time and increased it every time afterwards...then the prices would reset after a month or something along those lines.
---
Who would do such a thing? You seem like a nice guy I bet you it was that Jinogiacrus and Alexsloan guy
---
I would never say I didn't get my money out of 76, but it's also going to take some quality content to get me to play it again. 
---
My point is your experience won't necessarily encompass everything that can possibly happen in a game, and thinking so is extremely narrow minded and, frankly, ignorant. Your feeble attempts at insults support that also.
---
Did you really think demo expert was OP?
---
We need huge balance changes. Rockets are useless, most weapons are useless. Melee reigns Supreme. 
---
Re-read the post. Yes, I use spotlights
---
Let's not talk about how broken LMG's are. A tickle weapon.
---
Anti-Armor Explosive for basically any gun.
---
Instigating Explosive for high damage guns like the gauss, black powder, blunderbuss, etc.
---
Furious Explosive for any gun (note, nobody knows how high Furious goes so it could still be beaten by Two Shot for consistent damage output on multiple enemies).
---
And the stash of all your 5 donkey chars too.
---
And you get immediately bored watching a youtuber playing with rifles because it makes the video unnecessarily too long 
---
 I did 3 level 80s at Whitespring a few days a go. Finally some people showed up and down they went. Would have taken me a long time by myself. 
---
 BOS Heavy Combat Armor with a Dense Chest and Strengthened Limbs is immune to her screeching and explosions as well.  ;)
---
I agree 100%
---
The only people who want magical weapons are people who don't want a competitive experience. I was talking with a guy earlier when uses sentinel armor and apparently it's effect still works if you are jumping straight up and down....... sounds like someone who sucks at Fortnite who found magical armor.
---
I can kill a scorchbeast no problemo but it's TEDIOUS as hell and it's annoying as hell and noisy and just why would I? It's boring at this point
---
&gt; God forbid an enemy in this game requires some patience, planning, and strategy
---
How I kill scorchbeasts: jump around mostly so I can see but still get hit half the time by their bullshit AoE ticklesplosion breath and shoot them for longer than it should take until dead. Gee call me Sun Tzu with my genius strategy and tactics that are mindblowingly complex.
---
They do. Ive looted the blackwater ones and enclave bunker stashes semi daily. 
---
How about ending the faction quest line with them departing eastward to go found their own settlement, which they will name Rockopolis?
---
Not going to spend money on atoms until they provide more CONTENT.
---
My friends aren't leaving because of bug fixes, nerfs, and small QOL stuff.
---
They're BORED.  Bone deep bored.
---
My friends list is 95% offline in prime time now.  Haven't seen some people in weeks.
---
Into the west
---
They just haven't done enough, and a large portion of the original player base has moved on. Wish we could see the user count like on Steam. Bet it's more alarming than we realize. 
---
That's wrong
---
Fusion cores show up in the bag?
---
It can be tough, especially at the end where you need to protect robots from other robots in a fairly large room. A second player can really help there. If you post on fallout market that you want a compadre to guide you that first time, there are many, many people who are getting bored and would like to help and explain as you go. 
---
Or you could turn pacifist mode on and you wouldn’t have this problem. Wouldn’t have to make a stupid post that’s been made a thousand times already either.
---
Tl;dr learn to read the game instructions 
---
Damn. I'm kinda wishing I actually used that infinite fuel exploit back in the day now.. And I never cheat in games!
---
For some reason I thought fuel would be the easiest to come by 
---
this would be great if the stations were in working condition, otherwise it really doesn't make sense. 
---
They can land directly on you, resulting in instant death.
---
I've had it happen twice while aiming at one, another lands on your head.
---
Online game like this have cycles.  A lot of people start, some quit.  As content is depleted people play less often.  When new content is added players return and new ones are added.  Seen it many times.  It does not mean the game is dead by any means.
---
Shot in the dark, but I think at this point, abandoning it completely would result in a larger net loss than keeping at it, and trying to pull a "Final Fantasy" or "No Man's Sky", who both managed to turn things around.  
---
I think they need help, and I really think they need to make some changes in their QA and BETA Testing groups, especially breaking up the Echo Chamber it (as I perceive) they appear to have and get some outside (Community Member) voices in the mix, because many of the changes could only make sense if they are not actually "playing" the game.
---
They are mutants regardless (like ghouls) so no need to look for justification here
---
I think they need to scale back the legendary changes a little. It was just too harsh.  And it wasn't even the weapons that were the problem. It was their lazy sloppy ass grad-student coding that allowed them to be duped.
---
i've had lag since launch day. I even upgraded my video card from an R9 280 to a GTX 1060 hoping it would help but it didnt. I couldnt even walk into morgantown without my framerate dropping to nothing and my screen freezing while i got beat on by a horde of ghouls. I found some setting tweak suggestions and now i can handle everything but i still get those stutters and hitches occasionally. It seems to happen more and more the longer i play and/or the more i FT. 
---
Platform: ps4.      Gamertag: fishydocvoodoo.    Cash stashes have not refilled since patch. Also containers in general do not refill
---
I can't help but think those sonic attack blue donuts are horrible for people without high end computers. Why can't we turn those off, at least the graphics part, like you can turn off bullet decals in Borderlands 2 and when you put that game on low graphics you don't see sparks flying and pools of eridium and it helps a ton
---
Honestly I only played after 1.18. I really don't have a clue how it was at its very launch. Either way you can see that the game successfully recovered after a leadership change, maybe it's time for Bethesda to do the same. 
---
You get glowing blood and meat from robots too... Hmm
---
our Fallout 76 characters give new meaning to "thirsty AF"
---
They have to speed up updates for it.  While I really appreciate their Known Issues list I still can't be overly enthused about it because of how slow they are rolling out updates or even telling us when the updates will happen.  When you average 2 updates a month telling us something that's been broken since launch will be dealt with in a future patch.  Even if that's just 2 patches away that is really a month.  Add to that no actually new content has been announced and there are very few reasons to stick around.  People will step away until things get better and the ball is in Bethesda's court to make things better quick.
---
In regards to Survival mode I'm not really sure.  One of the huge issues people have is unwanted PVP so that would be a way to alleviate some of that.  Though I do feel prioritizing something like opening a vault, adding factions, or introducing new enemies/events are more necessary to meet the games immediate needs.
---
I believe it will use all of your ammo with the one charged shot. Something like that. Try it out for fun lol!
---
Plus remember datamined events built around PvP (some kind of presidential race or something).
---
When this year do you think?
---
twice the size and using a power fist to smash you into a new dimension.
---
Yeah, this has to be a glitch or something. I had it during the BETA lol.
---
they show up when manually drop them (not when you’re killed though)
---
My thruster is also my weak point
---
To be fair, they did make a case out of how they were going to limit the griefing and such that typically accompanies PvP, and basically make it very easy to continue to play your game and enjoy it without having to PvP. I highly doubt all the low level players being harassed on that server were really able to enjoy their game. 
---
It sounds like a good idea, but I see a couple of issues:
---
- Paying for fast travel is a sink for caps that makes sure too many don't accumulate. At present the game's economy is a joke, so this isn't an issue, but in the future this might be an important part of keeping inflation down.
---
- This potentially incentivizes tedium. Let's say I want to get from point A to point B. At present I just fast travel and pay a few caps. But now I might instead fast travel from A to the train station nearest A, then fast travel from that station to the station nearest B, then fast travel to B. That's 3 fast travels instead of 1, which takes a little bit longer to save a few caps. Perhaps fast traveling also puts a burden on the servers, since it has to load and then unload the area around the train stations (not 100% sure this is how it works).
---
Does anyone know why on several occasions I have found blocks that spell out “Danny B”? I can’t seem to figure this one out. I’ve found them in all parts of the map too which is weird.
---
Stop creating cynical speculating nonsense posts, please. The game could have 1000 players left and you wouldn't know in-game because you will still have the same server size, just fewer overall servers, which would have no significant affect on you unless you server hop every 2 minutes.
---
I'd be thrilled with 60.  Especially as someone who plays solo mostly, I spend a lot of time doing situational card swaps. Would be great to no have to stop and swap cards just to hack a terminal or pick a lock. 
---
What location are you referring to as Black Titanium?
---
There were wendigos in FO1 and/or FO2. can't remember which but they looked like the xenomorphs from Alien. 
---
Yeah, I mean that's basically what it is, somebody making a stop to fuel up a vehicle. I only need fusion cores to keep my power armor ready for a SBQ fight, so I'm not spending that kind of time trying to fight somebody to get them if I can get them faster another way. There is nothing quite so frustrating as somebody dropping a nuke on Fissure Prime and being low on cores and unable to join the event, since that fight is a bit too dangerous to go in with just a hazmat suit on.
---
As far as the PVP goes though, anybody who owns a workshop is already flagged for PVP. You don't need them to take the first shot. If you need a way to provoke them to return, you could try just claiming the workshop from them yourself. Some people will still server hop or find another workshop, but stealing ownership of a workshop is pretty much universally regarded as an invitation to come fight. The junkyard and the ammo factory are probably the ones that get contested the most, in my experience. Springs and bullets are way more in demand than fusion cores for the most part.
---
Looks more Mayan to me
---
The material mods like Polymer for Combat Armor are each separate: one for arms, one for legs, one for chest, and one for helmet. When you scrap any piece of armor, you can learn a mod (including material mods like Polymer) for any slot. The message will say something like "Unlocked: Polymer" but you won't know which slot unlocked. You have to unlock Polymer 4 times to get it available on all four slots.
---
I had the same problem at charleston fire dept. 
---
I was wondering if you'd show up. Thanks. 
---
Xbox, right?
---
I've been insta killed through pacifist multiple times, both times it was this guy who played I think it's Arabic pop music at high volume through the mic while shooting down multiple people. So edgy. 
---
I hope that kid grows up and cringes a little at what kind of person he was. 
---
At least they fixed the bobble head stacking.
---
One of the worst, least fun enemies in modern games.
---
I had one of my own glitch out and attack me. The other two were looking at it like WTF while it tried to gun me down. I ended up having to shoot it until it died, scrap it, then rebuild it.
---
We can go in it now ??? I’ve been really busy so I haven’t played in weeks 
---
Sorry, but I can't know if you are a new player, who does not know these things, and I just tried to help.
---
For a PvE experience, I'm with you. The nutty legendary mods and mutations are empowering and fun. However I think it guarantees there will never ever be anything approaching competitive balance in PvP, which not only do I think could be a lot of fun but also seems to be a priority for Beth. 
---
how much you want for it?
---
When did they fix it?
---
Waste of time, ammo and resources
---
\^\^This\^\^ 
---
Shotgun perks to 3\* inc Enforcer and I can take 3 SpamBeasts down in less than 30-40 shells each, not worth the effort though due to derisible loot.
---
I'm on PC so lucky I can use the nexus mod to tame down the visual spam and make it so I can see the bats as I force them to land.
---
Have you tried r/fo76bazaar?
---
Yeah, this is right. And I seem to remember it being outside on a balcony and not in a room. I also remember there being a tricycle next to it as well as a further nod to that kid from The Shinning. Unless this easter egg exists in multiple locations...
---
I still rock the 50 cal too. Just more towards melee now
---
Are you fucking joking lol. You see a decrease of less than 1% in subs over a single day and you claim that it's a 'steady decline' and 'almost daily'. 
---
I seriously hope you don't have a job that relies on statistics and analysis. 
---
Yup.  I’ve done that too
---
if that is your objection then don't engage. if they are attacking a resource you are mining then you make a calculation and either engage or not based on that.  Your call.
---
Yeah if ONLY there was even a SLIM chance that you might get something really unique or useful off the Scorchbeasts... I mean I really enjoy having a SB heart in my inventory but I wouldn't mind a damn legendary something or other
---
Same here, I 100% got my money's worth, and I don't feel 'as bad' (if that's an ok thing to say) if I think of the last couple of months as an extended beta where BGS is trying to figure things out. I felt way worse when I thought BGS simply didn't care or respect the players who have poured a lot of hours into their game and continue to support the game and want to see it succeed. Instead, I just see it as a game studio in over it's head and there's other people/forces making them trying to squeeze money out of it. 
---
There is a face in Tenagra town in the cave on the way up. And a shrine under the burried church in the mire. The church shrine has a picture of a moth adorning the interior entrance. This certainly seems to indicate a relationship between the mothman and the interloper. Perhaps the mothman is the interloper's herald  or harbinger. Perhaps it is its enemy...
---
No, on PC. 
---
Nah, the animations and behavior are completely different. Scorchbeasts tend to hover, while dragon prefer swooping around. And the landing animations are wildly different too.
---
Even the attacks are completely different. Dragons attack using a variation of magic, where Scorchbeast shrieks are technically an explosive projectile.
---
It’s because they sound like me while I’m gaming. Too relatable to be my enemy. 
---
Well known, the wiki even states the plans are found by doing mother load quest.
---
&gt; They only tickle me
---
And blind me! And deafen me! But mostly I can't see shit.
---
Crafting flamer fuel is horribly inefficient and its more efficient to craft an entirely new flamer just for the fuel.
---
The theory is its supposed to craft 50 fuel instead of 5 and a developer just missed a zero, but either way this is terribly unbalanced and makes flamers horribly underpowered. I know there are other bigger issues, but I really really want this fixed. Please. 
---
Yes, over-repairing both armor and weapons gives them bonus damage or bonus damage resist.
---
Please note, some like the Grognak Axe can't be over-repaired.  Probably an oversight.
---
Yeah... Fallout Pubg edition would be fine and nice, but for the people that don't really give a shit about that there are still so very many different directions they could take this game in that would be awesome. For the rest of us, since this game is an mmo, they could actually treat it like one by having fun meaningful group events and competitions with prizes that are worth caring about and things like that. I mean for fuck's sake, the event that is going on right now is for fucking sleeping. In game. Fucking sleeping? That is the best shit you guys could come up with really? You put 25 people on a server and encourage nap time? Imagine if there were way more, way cool things to do with caps, and there were like 4-8 man contests that sporadically spawn and give like 1000 cap pots to the winner. Wouldn't that be awesome? Instead, they put out the dullest shit imaginable.
---
I am not going ask what body part comes from, no I am not.
---
The last patch you couldn't stack explosive bobble heads plus they nerfed explosive weapons and explosive perk, so you shouldn't be able to be killed through pacifist right now at least. 
---
Dude they fucking attack us sometimes and follow us, we don't engage them, they just start attacking sometimes. And to not engage means trying to run far away and they follow you. So it means quitting the server. For Bethesda trying to make us not server hop so much , the SB sure are a thing that make us do it a lot
---
Lord save us...
---
Oh ok, never mind will delete
---
They are really good against weaker enemies, but their ammo craft is well bad. 5 ammo at a time for a weapon that goes through 100 ammo in like 8 seconds. 
---
Is there more, or do you mean the night-stalker monster?
---
This is probably the oldest topic, but in terms of computer games history and actual size, the cave is much larger
---
When was the last patch? 
---
when the servers not crashing i usually try and claim a bunch of workshops all at once since there is no limit to how many you can own and then go off and explore/farm events or enemies while they collect resources. 
---
a month after launch i was routinely getting 100 pounds of scrap per play session. unfortunately something happened a few weeks ago and now i cant go more the an hour or 2 without a crash.
---
Interesting, never run across anyone that douchy on the game and I'm at 122 and just started a new one at almost 20.  If you get video of it, post a video, I think everyone would like to be able to identify them.
---
Please do not buy serums from the vendor bots :)
---
Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits.  Players are selling them for MUCH cheaper there.
---
Oh yeah i love rotting scorch beast heart!
---
Rockopolis is in the Capitol Wasteland, where the modern town of Rockville is located, east by southeast from Morgantown.
---
I killed vengeful mothman yesterday but when he was suppose to die he flew away ? 
---
It’s right there in my previous post. Unless you are very bad at math yourself then you would see how my estimated hours of a lvl 700 are correlated to the OP and his play time per day.
---
Bulk everything you can and keep only three of each bulked item. Store only ammo you actually use. Store only weapons you actually use. Store only a minimal amount of reserve chems. 
---
I'm not sure there has ever been a single person who has said "yes, I like fighting scorchbeasts, they're a very well designed and not at all annoying enemy"
---
Folks saying they're easy to kill when you get TSEs and shit? Sure.   
---
Folks saying they're good game design? Fuck nah.
---
This is in general idea for each type of weapon and mostly on paper theory crafting. Haven't been able to test most of these. If anyone could chime in on some numbers that would be cool.
---
Anti-armor with +25% fire rate is best for powerful slower firing weapons like rifles. I think Anti-armor would beat out Furious on these. VATS crit damage might be better if you run a crits build.
---
Weapons that are already high rate of fire guns like automatics would benefit from Furious and +10% damage while aiming as you'll already be needing to reload after a short amount of time anyway and Furious caps.
---
Shotguns still benefit from explosive greatly, as each pellet has an AOE effect then. I'm not sure if Two Shot is still the best but it would add an extra pellet with +25% damage AND Explosive is bugged with BOTH AA and Fur.
---
Bloodied is a good prefix for guns, but if you invest heavily into a bloody build you may as well run melee instead as the damage is even better and the build more suited to it.
---
Most other effects seem to be niche or general effects, nothing that could beat these for DPS increases. Instigating is good for trash mobs, but not something like the Queen. Berserker is good for nuke runs if you run with a Hazmat suit.
---
do you work for bethesda?
---
&gt;They only tickle me!
---
Do they even tickle? There might be a bug involved but after I got that perk it stopped dealing any damage at all.
---
I can sit all day in that stuff.
---
The Cap perception perk is worthless now. It “jingles” around a cap stash whether it has caps in it or not...
---
Yeah, they already made their money.  On to the next game... 
---
Casual gameplay has given me more than 3x the atoms I need to buy everything I want.
---
I got a weapon skin, a pip-boy skin, a social icon, and about 3k atoms to spare.
---
Furious tops out at 30% damage after 6-8 shots.
---
Bloodied is the way to go if you want the next most overpowered combo, but it does take a little more effort.
---
That is one way to look at it, just not my way.  Whatever suits.
---
My advice is to keep only junk in it. Bulk your aluminum and lead. The only thing I keep in mine is my other power armor suits(only because finding the one I actually use would be a huge pain in the ass if I kept them on me) and junk. Because you can get a number of weight reducing perks for everything else and you don't drop everything else when you die.
---
The one vengeful Mothman I killed turned into a whisp of white powder. Is that what happened to yours? This Wise Mothman didnt do that. His body just stayed normal in a lifeless state... tragic.
---
Why can't you have both on? 
---
Well idk about disabling it all together but I would very much like to see passafist mode become a PvP flag. 
---
I think I’m going to start using this one everywhere now.  Confuse the shit out of people.  
---
Clearly not
---
I usually avoid these kinds of threads, but I have to agree, for different reasons.
---
Their sonic attacks make me ill.
---
Even one scorchbeast can fill the air around me with bright flashing colors moving in random directions, making it impossible to even orient myself, let alone fight back.
---
I usually pop a radx and close my eyes until the sound stops.  Now that I have my locking missile launcher I feel like I can fight back without having to aim.
---
But I'm not being facetious when I say getting attacked makes me physically I'll, and when they go into screaming mode, all fun stops until they die.
---
I get the world building point... scorchbeasts destroyed and infected West Virgina.  The Brotherhood of Steel couldnt fight back.  I see why they act the way they do, lore wise.
---
But they rapidly become not fun, and a chore.  And this is coming from a filthy casual who enjoys collecting tin cans and actually walks between Top Of The World and the Free States merchant for fun.
---
Very underrated comment
---
There is more to life than BOOMs.  Well for some people there is, others not so much.
---
I never used any melee weapons until 2 patches ago. Now I love em! Lol
---
I have the jet pack on mines , and it’s a torso mod 
---
Just curious is later this year like, March; or is later this year more like December?
---
Dude you don’t have to be mad it’s just a friendly discussion over a video game that we have a shared interest in, relax. 
---
see the post just above by  [Jholagian](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jholagian), he names 2 of the 3. Regardless, if that's how they want to play, Fine. Bethesda is clearly giving them a space to do it, just pull that shit out of Adventure. 
---
Yeah I haven't logged in since the last patch.  I'll be lurking around and give it another shot whenever I can pay some Atoms to respec. 
---
Scorchbeast OP, please nerf. 
---
More quests, more holotapes, more notes, new areas
---
Does seem to be the case, mostly the OP get downvotes but replies get upvotes. I think there are some sad sacks who just refresh the front page of r/fo76 and down vote all the new posts from the side bar for... 
---
reasons ?!
---
I am not some people, vault dweller.
---
Pvp is great but the market is already way oversaturated with better pvp games. They have such a cool base for a game with so much amazingly fun, but still lore-friendly stuff they could do that trying to compete in an arena they can never really compete in seems pointless and like a huge misstep.
---
I had three attack my fucking CAMP once. 
---
My Camp! I'm nowhere near any fissures, it's near Monongah ffs, specifically BECAUSE of the lack of fissure sites, but NOOOOOO, gotta just say "fuck this guy in particular" in the event that someone was actually enjoying the game a little bit. 
---
I just logged off. It wasn't worth the fight.
---
I don't have it unlocked on anything hahah :(
---
I would love that
---

---
They made an explicit point that if someone wants to kill you they are allowed to. They also said they wanted to limit griefing. That means that random murder is not griefinng according to Bethesda but part of the game. If people disagree with this they should vote with their wallets, not with their keyboards after they have paid.
---
Good to know. Thanks for the tip. 
---
And with this, the limitations of the camp and the reasons for them are dead. The camp was designed to be limited to prevent this. Well bethesda failed.  
---
Though the failed a long time ago with the ladder houses. 
---
Found the whitespring turret base builder.
---
Lets say the that the restore the track quest needs to be done by at least one person per day for 3 months before that section of track is repaired. It could be that long that section there are several points where either you removed debris or repair the track using steel. After that it becomes a maintain the track quest, and that portion of track is a permanent change to the world. Once that section of track is repaired then it would be another long term event to repair/build a train.
---
Yeah, basically as soon as you equip it, it's loaded with every single fusion cell you have. If you fire it, whether you have 10 or 10,000 cores, they all get used.
---
I remember running into event where I found 3 dead ritual guys dead all of them had notes but I can’t remember what the notes said I’ll have to read them once I get on 
---
I haven't played 76 since Sunday, and I feel I made a really good decision doing so. I'm playing Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and I haven't had this much fun in a few months! No lag, no lockups, and I get to solve PUZZLES! 
---
I'll come back after I finish the TR game. I'm not uninstalling 76 and I will be back, but I'm just having too much fun right now.
---
The atom store items will add to your base stats just like the Grognak costume did for a limited time! Buy now and you will have + extra HP per unique costume in group! 
---
&gt; The TSE nerf drove away a lot of players... not just because it nerfed their big boom boom sticks... 
---
Nerfing the perks that they previously made no mention of is what really pissed me off.
---
I expected, understood, and even welcomed a TSE nerf, but don't kill my perks and ruin my build, too! 
---
Also why does the breath spam do so much CDN damage.  All of this injury plus the insult of all your armor breaking.  Ballistic Fiber &gt; anything you get from scorchbeasts
---
I like PUBG, tons of fun, but this could be so, so much more. Settlements, trade routes, taking and holding valuable resources, roles within a clan like weapon or armor smith, or doctor. A PUBG round lasts 20-30 minutes, the worlds we could build could last weeks! Events are fun too, at least they were the first few times I did each one. 
---
It has a bigger, more varied world than any other Fallout. How is it more about grinding than exploration? You are choosing to grind shit, and tbh there is no great reward from grinding anyway, so why do you bother? I have played over 200 hours and I've never felt like I had to grind anything.
---
Also, PA is basically always better than normal armour. It's baked into the IP. While I don't particularly like this part of any Fallout game, it's not a new premise in 76 so I have no idea why you're pointing it out as a 76 design decision. 
---
This post is just weird lol. You shit talk the game but claim it's cool... why don't you play a game you think is good with your friends?
---
Seriously, they're irritating as hell. I've been begging for them to be fixed since the first week. I doubt they'll change it. 
---
No AAA studio should ever release a game THIS bad. There is no excuse.
---
That's because bethesda banned everybody and isnt replying to our tickets or to as of why we were all banned in the first place 
---
 Its certainly a large part of the game that I have played. I'm sure there's some things that don't work properly that I have not encountered but so what.  
---
 There is nothing even remotely game breaking and you started with the insults.
---
A mix for me. Definetly less people over 100,but more people between 1-60.
---
I haven't seen them any vendors post patch. I have the limbs, and need the torso.
---
[I wrote this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/adwxr7/stash_rules_everything_around_me_team_get_the/)
---
This is exactly my feeling.
---
I think having high prices and the ability to earn stuff in game results in next to no one buying atoms, and next to no one being happy about it.
---
you guys leveled up too fast :)  
---
My point isn't to say that the correct balance changes have all happened, but in terms of procedure it makes sense to do balance changes first before releasing new content. No one ever claimed that the recent balance patch fixed everything and balance is perfect now. More balance changes should be coming eventually. Bethesda just cherry picked easy, obvious things to rebalance first. Melee is not straightforward to fix because it affects low level players and their leveling experience whereas explosive damage, TS legendary, and E legendary mainly affects high level game play.
---
\&gt; Did you really think demo expert was OP?
---
I haven't tried out explosives thoroughly so I don't really know if they needed tuning or not. Maybe I'll try that next but I'm not going to play unless more content is released.
---
I have a level 100+ character specced into heavy guns and I think the DPS is in a good place but their durability is too low and they consume ammo too quickly. I have another 100+ character specced into pistols and shotguns and both are in a very good place. They kill monsters efficiently and I don't struggle with ammo or durability (using only Gunsmith, no Lucky Break). 
---
nope, servers are always packed on xb1, thriving
---
I use a legendary quad-action lever action rifle and quite like it - base damage is around 140 with some mods and perks based on rifles, and I have tormentor for crippling and the anti-armor perks in Perception. Obviously, there are some stronger builds out there, but LAR aren't that annoying to repair, and 45 ammo is very easy to craft and find out in the wild. It's also a very nice VATS gun - my headshot accuracy is really good, and you can now cut-off the reloading and fire a shot.
---
agreed, sick of the griefers and kiddies. not all of us have sentinel assassin armour, that our duper friend gave us, that spends 10 hours a day on fo76
---
Those extra 26 will just be passive perks that should already work as such haha 
---
Only all patterns are listed not purchasable mods.
---
Makes sense. I only use VATS for quick shots and it works fine there. Maybe it tends to desync if you wait.
---
I generally only keep 50 (never use), 100 (sometimes use), or unlimited (use all the time or rare) of any type of junk.
---
We need more stash space!
---

---
Didn't even read the text. Upvote based on title alone.
---
What do you do about your legendary stuff?
---
At this point I think a bunch of the team quit.  Along the lines of, “this is exactly what we said would happen if you built another game on creation engine.” And “this is exactly what we said would happen if you launched in 2018”
---
Lots of open positions on this team are posted now including roles you’re unlikely to have two of (particularly at cheap-ass Bethesda) like producer.  And unlike in suburban Maryland, folks in Austin have a ton of other options.
---
You were to OP in a Group, so they nerfed it. 
---
So its ok when you go prowling around the wasteland killing mob after mob at your convenience but you complain bitterly when the role is reversed and something powerful and malign is hunting you?  Suck it up wastelander!  Its an et or be et world.  Now what you gonna be, top predator or a pile of dung?
---
You're kidding me you don't know the difference between you're and your.  
---
If I remember correctly the notes wasn't that important. It was basically a girl who was super spiritual in her faith, and a boy who liked her trying to get laid. And the dad coming along to try and make sure the boy didn't get laid.
---
I play third person and sometimes it happened to me too. My fix tip is... Just zoom again and it's done :) 
---
the regular (+5) limbs plan is at morgantown station but I'm after the +10 to make some leveling armour for an alt.
---
What's wrong with that camp?
---
Thanks for this, i'm taking away a lot of great stuff from it!
---
I don't min/max my build. I try to have it set up where i can be effective while still enjoying it w/out being forced into a meta. That said i am primarily 2H Melee even though i have never played a Melee FO character. I use shotguns as a secondary due to perk/special synergy, although i prefer and have always played a pistol gunner. 
---
I Have a Zealot's .50 MG i've been holding onto for when i eventually decide to brave SBQ and a Zealot's Grognak's Axe, so i've been considering swapping out shotguns for heavy guns and your suggestions are definitely appreciated. 
---
I haven't ventured into mutations yet but that's on my list!
---
They want us to explore the game in a slow pace. So they said they didnt want mount. :( I know the playerbase does.
---
I'm not mad, I'm criticizing this post. It's not a friendly discussion about anything. There is no discussion to be had. You're speculating that the population is shrinking and that the game could be dead soon. And that's worthless because not a single person replying to this thread could state with any reasonable amount of proof or analysis that the game's population is shrinking or that the game could be in danger. You don't have the data to make this into a discussion.
---
Logging in and counting the number of players on your server is not comprehensive analytics, it's a useless anecdote. 
---
That's not the issue.
---
If you play with sound, it's a relentless wall of SKWEEE-WEEE-WEEE. For hours and hours and hours and hours and hours.
---
Also, the sonic circle fuckwaddies render you UNABLE TO SEE the bastards. So you can't even shoot them. In the groin area. Where they deserve it. The nuts, I mean in the nuts.
---
And it pushes you. STOP PUSHING ME.
---
The damage is not the issue. It's the sheer SPAM of it.
---
Oh jesus christ
---
There is no banned gear
---
Yeah, typical Bethesda. "Let's let you craft stuff that looks cool, but has zero fucking functionality". Like an appliance stove or BBQ grill you can't actually cook on, or a Nuka Cola machine you can't restock (or even use as a stash box). 
---
Naw, it's still locked up sadly. That's why my screenshots are just of the entry and closed vault door. :P  If it was open I'd have a whooole bunch more!
---
Yes, thats called "building a character." Jesus christ is this bethesdas first game? What nonsense. Next we should remove power armor because i feel COMPELLED to use it when i play. Can you guys also remove weapons, because i feel compelled to use weapons when a ghoul runs at me. And lets remove the pip boy and mini map too, im getting some really compelling feelings with them in the game. 
---
....when RDR2 just gets it...
---
Yeah, I agree.  Especially without a free respec option.  I knew a TSE nerf was coming.  And I too knew it was needed, but I do think they went a little too heavy handed with it.
---
Hold them all. I also run excavator armor with dual calibrated shocks all the time so that helps.
---
When I first saw these head statues my first thought were the ones in dwemer ruins in skyrim
---
Does anyone know the spec/armor these guys use? Whenever I try and kill them I do zero damage to them but they 1-4 shot me. 
---
I mean more for building the defenses for workshops. Like when you have take Poseidon Energy and it throws 3 waves of robots, I'll get Xp for the ones i actually hit but not from the enemies my turrets kill.
---
I think that we should be able to display weapons on back and belt. Clipping will be an issue of course, but better that nothing.
---
I am presently buying $20/month to support the game.  
---
Scorched don't have any DR so they are relatively easy. Go find some super mutants or cave crickets. Much more DR and exponentially harder to kill at lower level than your lvl 68 scorched.
---
Having it weightless and in a fixed amount would be amazing, maybe 250 max for each junk type and less for the rare ones
---
I have a lot of these little things I would like to see in the game to make the world more "real", but like you said, they have a lot to do at the moment.
---
Thing is, the game ran out of content as of now, most of the people already did everything there really was to do.
---
Have not logged in and deleted the game when they pushed the last patch.  Went back to destiny for the moment until anthem and division 2 comes out. 
---
There is a little maintence car right next to the Top of the World train station. They could create a quest to have to repair that and then fast travel would be free between stations.
---
Yes, I still don't understand the connection between the cult of the Mothman and the Interloper, but they're definitely connected. And yes, there's a face inside the Treehouse Village in Tenagra Town! That's a weird place. I bet the faces will have some big part on the story moving forward! =]]
---
 You can keep your balance as long as the Scorchbeasts do not suffer. My favorite part of the game.
---
Fun read for sure, but man, it makes me sad to hear you doing that quest at level 28. Such a waste for All Rise.
---
Bloodied +250DR while reloading +obligatory tertiary like weight reduction or +1PER
---
Yeah that’s what I thought 
---
No worries , it can sound condescending though.
---
" Are you a new player ?, Are you sure you've double checked there's nothing in your build storage " something like would have been more clearer.
---
Apologies for " Really ?.. " it's the internet and i always choose the harsh tone. :)
---
Trying to walk through the waste land for point A to point B? Be a shame if a scorched beast infuriated that for no apparent reason 
---
I don't think people are quitting.  They are just playing less, now that they got the fun of exploring a new game out of their system.  I still find servers filled with players, and occasionally I light into low populated server.  Like most games, the amount if full time players fluctuate, depending on bugs or new content.
---
Yes, the ritual guys appear a lot (dead, of course ^_^). It seems there's more to this story!
---
Ask and you shall receive, for the mere pittance of 300 atoms. Good luck trying to get anything to actually stick to it though. Beth drops the ball (or the darts) once more.
---
This has been my base since I remade it in a new location well after level 50. I deeply suspect I have phantom budget but the thought of trashing it all and remaking it irks me. I have the materials but like many things in the game I just sigh thinking that even if it does show I have phantom budget it won't matter. The chances of it being fixed in the next 3 months are slim.
---
I hate how utterly jaded I am because of how the first 3 months have gone.
---
Problem is we can’t even get the weapons we have now to not clip. Ever tried wearing the marine armour or any power armour and seeing the stock on your rifle? Thing just dissappears into the torso geometry.  
---
Sadly I don’t think the engines built for it. It’s old as balls and even with the new lighting it shows.
---
it used to be REALLY dark. A lot of people complained and they made night less dark. The cries of the masses and all that...
---
Makes sense that this could happen with very high int, since that’s also a power armor stat and where mass screws are most needed?
---
Biggest problem is how the game communicates the thresholds where scrapping changes
---
its incredibly annoying looking at the base of my scope instead of through it. its probably been in the game longer than ive noticed it, but it seems to have only gotten more frequent over the last few weeks.
---
What you are talking about sounds more like the pvp in ESO and if they did something like that, yeah it would be totally badass, but the problem is I don't believe they have the resources to do that and make this a not shitty pve experience within a decent timetable... I mean really both pvp and pve could be a lot more. But they would have to give enough of a shit to make it that way and the scary reality is that they would probably be better off just making a new game instead.
---
Well, just for shits and giggles, let's review how to kill all the different enemies in Fallout 76:
---
* Scorched: Shoot them in the head as they run at you.  
---
* Super Mutants: Shoot them in the head as they run at you.  
---
* Ghouls: Shoot them in the head as they run at you.  
---
* Mole Miners: Shoot them in the head as they hmphmrgh at you.  
---
* Mole Rats: Shoot them in the head as they tunnel at you.  
---
* Wolves: Shoot them in the head as they run at you. Bad dog.  
---
* Yao Guai: Shoot them in the head as they run at you.   
---
* Deathclaw: Shoot them in the tummy as they lunge at you and maybe pee a little bit.  
---
* Radscorpion: Shoot them in the tail as they GOD DAMMIT STOP BURROWING YOU'RE NOT HYDRALISKS!  
---
* Grafton Monster: Shoot them in the ??? as they basically just stare at you.  
---
* Mr Gutsy: Shoot them in the thruster as they hover at you.  
---
* Assaultron: Shoot them in the legs as they ka-CHUNK ka-CHUNK ka-CHUNK at you.  
---
* Protectron: Shoot them in their arms as they shamble at you, then watch the fireworks.  
---
* Eyebot: Shoot them in the... really? Just ignore them.  
---
* Mirelurk: Shoot them in the head as they skitter at you.  
---
* Liberators: Shoot them in the communism as they fail at you.  
---
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. The problem is that enemies in Fallout fall into one of roughly three categories: trash mobs, bullet sponges, or boss mobs. Trash mobs and bullet sponges are really straightforward and kind of boring to fight, while boss mobs (Mirelurk Queens, Scorchbeasts) have some basic mechanics attached to them that aren't telegraphed super well. Scorchbeasts *are* somewhat annoying to fight, but I will take an annoying enemy over a boring one a million times over.
---
To be perfectly honest, though, I think Fallout could use better monster design, and by that I don't mean *visual* design but gameplay. The game's got an incredible variety of different monsters that all feel kind of the same, which is a crying shame. It'd be cool if Fallout's designers took more inspiration from Bungie's shooters which have a comparatively small number of enemies, but each enemy feels distinct; each enemy in for example Halo: CE feels like they fill a unique, necessary niche, and there's little overlap.
---
But that's a whole 'nother topic. Bottom line, scorchbeasts suck; I love them.
---
These posts are so whiny and I hate that everyone resorts to “raaaaaw fucken fire people” .. 
---
Just leave. You will server hop until your shitshrivels so you can make 100 caps but when the zOmg Broken Scrotchbeasts come at you, ya decide to sit there sobbing while they scream at you until you get butthurt enough to post about it? 
---
I don’t get it at all.
---
 How do you know this? Can you support this claim in anyway?
---
Wish I would have seen this yesterday ☹️
---
How long have you been waiting? 
---
Any idea why you were banned? Beth already came out with a pretty no nonsense answer to why personnel are being banned from the game, and the criteria they need to meet in order to be banned. So why do you think it happened to you?
---
Some dude deep in the heart of a BGS cube-farm is slowly rubbing his nipples while reading this.
---
I am not 100% sure as I never researched it but if the BoS does, it would be the polymer mod as that is one step down.
---
You don't have to run 15 minutes across the Map from a scorchbeasts, at most about 1 minute but I get your point, they fixed some of the distance that enemies chase you, not just the scorch beast.
---
They kind of have to have new enemies respawn else it would be empty for everything, works in our favour sometimes so we can farm xp or loot.
---
Quests are crap, nothing much to be said here.
---
The stash size is BS and unacceptable 3 months later.
---
So is TSE pretty much dogshit for everything but shotguns now?
---
I ment duped not sure why I typed banned
---
How often does this happen? I haven't had any trouble with my nocturnal explosive shotgun yet. Is there a specific trigger I should be wary of?
---
Reminds me of Overwatch. How some heroes were considered "must picks", so instead of rising the rest up to be in competition with the must picks they nerf the popular one. 
---
That they do.
---
I wonder what they will Nerf next, maybe hazmat suites. 
---
“We’ve reduced the values on the Lone Wanderer perk to make it feel less necessary so that players could explore other options.”
---
Yeah I agree the calibrated shocks are amazing 
---
figures the enclave guy would be a grammar nazi....
---
Because Bethesda makes you feel like a fucking criminal for playing their game
---
Indeed! That other thread talks about it. They do seem very similar. I'm willing to bet that there's a connection between everything Bethesda related.
---
I get 2-3 at least once a play through, and nope off the server
---
Devs: We are aware some players are stuck inside the vault-Welcome to Vault Tech, a better life, underground. You are now the experiment
---
Todd and Emil ran out of money to give to people to keep playing the game 
---
I had to move my camp from an awesome spot by the asylum because every time someone failed “Line In the Sand”  the fucking SB would just cruise right over to my camp and start annihilating it. Had to server hop several times to avoid them because despite being level 51 none of my weapons are even fucking close to powerful enough to take on one solo. 
---
I want to love this game so bad but it’s so fucked up I created a Reddit account just so I could find out what the fuck is happening with it. 
---
You can’t see one side, it probably has a one piece foundation and ladder holding it up.
---
Look at you eating downvotes for proposing a simple solution. This place man lol. 
---
Ithink antiseptic
---
Good maths man! Any thoughts on the main points of my post? 
---
And what do I have to do to be unbanned or get a response and I had a pvp battle with someone woke up to a ban after being harassed with 13 messages from the person I pvp battled with
---
Friendly fire does work with the shishkebab. And the flamer only needs to hit to activate the heal over time so if you’re strictly healing the ammo isn’t that bad.
---
Other melee weapons with flame mod may work but I haven’t tested them.
---
This is just the pillar glitch that was recently found.
---
1) I have yet to see someone show that you can legally move your CAMP if you build something like this. When I first started building my CAMP I played around with some glitching concepts. I could build certain things I couldn't otherwise do but I could never move my CAMP. The game would notice that the blueprint was illegal and not allow for a replacement.
---
2) This particular glitch breaks a balance rule that Bethesda has for the game. Specifically, the fact that all floors must be accessible. This is why you can't legally build a second floor without building a stair first. Be prepared for Bethesda to nerf the shit out of this glitch.
---
I spent more than 2 hours working on my own pyramid yesterday. That 7X7 foundation is super hard to find anyplace flat enough to put it on. I tried The Gorge workshop but it's not flat enough.
---
I'd enjoy a speed video if you could built it faster this time. Do you place the straight blocks first, edit out the unnecessary ones, then add the ramps?
---
It is absurd that people ask for darker anything in a game that has no brightness slider at all. Put a proper brightness setting into the game then we can talk about making the game darker.
---
I only keep junk in my stash, bulk and scrap. Use your alt characters to store either junk or stuff you want to keep. I have 10 characters, 2 xboxes, I move stuff to various characters for various reasons until they fix that atrocious mess they call a stash
---
see, i tend to not take the shops in an attempt to conceal my presence. like im roleplaying a burglar so to speak. once i become wanted then yeah, im obvious on the map but if i dont attempt reclaim then the owner does not get a notification and if they dont loom at the map then they may miss me. also, if someone comes to kill me then perhaps it creates a unique scenario for the owner- can they or do they want to risk being im the crossfire?
---
so let’s say someone owns the ammunitions factory... i see their GT, look for em on the map. if they’re under level 50 i won’t exactly pull my bullshit. but if i see they’re like lvl 80 and i come to learn they’re pumping out 5.56 (which is what i need) then i start stealing their ammo. sure, gathering 5.56 in general is a chore (any ammo i suppose) BUT how am i to know that the shop owner doesn’t have 20k sitting in their stash that they’ll just toss at a whim when they need stash space? of course i dont assume the higher level player has tons of ammo but i should not assume they’re performing labor so they may continue the game. same thing for fusion cores- of course, the player may be anxious to go to SBQ but they may also be a core hoarder so they can always have 30 cores on hand “just in case”. there’s really no way for me to know. 
---
the other thing i am trying to achieve is to create tension. i run a Perception/Agility build. i have no clue who i am stealing from. my ass is a glass cannon but being wanted is highly to my disadvantage because the other player may be able to one-shot me with TSE pump shotgun or lever rifle. it’s not about the caps, it’s about someone else “beating” me by executing me with precision. 
---
PvP is obviously the mechanic of attacking one another physically, but what about psychologically? of course, playing “psychologically” walks the razor’s edge of griefing. you interpret me as a griefer, i think i am attempting to be creative/unique. 
---
i actually appreciate your input because you disagree with me AND offer your perspective on the game mechanics. what you have caused is for me to realize i may actually do something i think could be interesting to others but it could actually just be annoying and useless to them (like a player that loathes that this is multi/PvP). i want them to have maybe a tough time time but i dont to cause the average player a bad time.
---
maybe this game needs a mechanic that you can only steal so much in a timeframe. that could be the medium between annoying dicks like me vs. the guy that finally got a couple hours to himself this week. 
---
so i guess i can’t worry too much about the chore thing, i could tone it back incase it is a chore for the other player. but that truck analogy you gave resonated with me and is a valid point. believe it or not but i am now compelled to evaluate what exactly i am achieving here... a little jab is fun, but i dont want other players to think im trying to insult them at any expense.
---
Last night I was sneaking around and looked up to see 3 of those fucks flying in a direction and noped the fuck out of there, what am I, made of ammo? They can go fuck themselves.
---
Same 300+ hours and nothing to keep me playing. Scorchbeast Queen is a chore now since they nerfed TSE too much that she rarely dies now so that isn't worth the ammo or effort launching a nuke, and well, there's nothing else to really do
---
So the fact that you don't have an explosive weapon doesn't give you a hint about why you don't experience this bug affecting only explosive weapons :thinking_face:
---
"we saw a increase in people taking this perk... better fix it as it was a bug" but really I didn't know so I will grab it
---
I hey so much aluminum off junk a scrap I sell it.
---
I think scorchbeasts are cool but I agree that their sonic attack is annoying as hell. Scorchbeasts can actually land on your C.A.M.P. if you build a tower with a large enough flat roof. One landed on my 5x5 tower floor while I was building it next to the popular SBQ fight location for supporting other people. I have to say, trying to build a C.A.M.P. near a fissure site, specially fissure site prime, will test your temper. Took me more than an hour to build a simple support tower and lots of reparing due to multiple scorchbeasts attacking.
---
Yeah, I want to be able to use the "drop all junk" stash feature again.  Right now all that "feature" does is overload my stash with garbage that takes up weight....lol
---
I haven’t logged in in a few weeks.  My wife quit months ago.
---
We bought a second Xbox and tv and set up another gaming area in our home and bought a ton of merch in anticipation of playing this together for years.
---
Utter disappointment.  And zenimax/beth leadership knew exactly what they were doing.
---
Beth can’t wait to cut their losses on this one and turn the servers off.
---
That means we need to blame the *checks notes* programmer from Skyrim who created them, since they're in the INI files as dragon.skyrim.ini. 
---
Ding!
---
You track the progress globally rather than per world instance, quests already do this aside from a few that can have minor rollbacks.  Repairing the tracks would be a community quest(s) of sorts.  Getting authorized to use them could be an individual type quest or quests. 
---
Personally I would go further with the train thing and make it an actual vehicle that travels from station to station, now of course it needs to be destroyable and Robbable 😬
---
Cool, so let's see it.
---
“A perk actually helping you become strong and allowing you to deal with the threats of the wasteland giving the player somewhat of a sense of character progression? Not in my game!”
---
I wish I had known about that myself. I did it early to save myself from the bots
---
"We are looking into it. Expect us to find a possible solution by next year."
---
Had previous experience with those two?  Any video proof of what they've been doing?
---
The game successfully recovered after a crapload of money was injected into it and many people were replaced. I don't expect Bethesda to do that for a game that is nowhere near as dysfunctional as FF14 was at launch (I did play the early version). Not to mention, there's a big difference between corporate pride in Japan and the rest of the world, they go to extremes that I wouldn't expect from North America. 
---
I also don't take kindly to people talking about 'leadership change' or any other job change when it comes to dev companies. You really don't have the slightest clue what is causing the issues with this game-- none of us do-- but you're comfortable talking about someone losing their job? 
---
I'd hate to see a world where you and I and all other gamers have our livelihood threatened by angry little nerds. xD
---
We got their B team all the talent isbfocusing on TES 6 and Starfield. 
---
Made 2700 atoms so far, none are bought. I havent bought anything except the sniper outfit.
---
Theres isnt really a nice item i want so i completly ignore the shop. 
---
Magical transportation in a gritty sci-fi survival game isn't magical and frosty, sparkly, twinkly enough.
---
Nope never have never will, I don't  support microtransctions. You paid $60 for a game you should be getting the full game which clearly we not so.
---
Um. Kay.
---
Everybody wants to be Fortnite but doesn’t want to pay for something worth dumping cash into. 
---
I feel your pain. I like to grab workshops and the Scorchbeast defends are BS. 
---
Here is an easy way to deal with any “defend” events that are annoying or bugged: leave. Lose the worship and come back and do the reclaim quest. 
---
If you put down something expensive, like the fusion genny,  just store it before you go. The retake quest even gives the same xp and rewards as three annoying defend waves. 
---
When you go into a scope does your sound shoot up really loud for a second? Cause it does for meeee
---
...and then they make 2 post about it. First one says "bla bla bla...We can't wait to tell you more, but that in next post" and then in 2nd post they tell something about something that is happening 3 months from now and that is recycled content.
---
Yes, I was only kidding but your idea makes sense :)
---
Yeah that's an awesome pic!! 
---
ah, i didnt realize that as i just started,that is too bad! thanks for the reply
---
i wonder why they didnt like nighttime being dark? we all have pipboy lights/mining caps/power armor headlights..
---
oh well, it is unfortunate for sure, in a game like fallout, the more atmospheric the better!
---
First off I am moron lol, how do you change the look of your character? Tired of looking at the bozo I originally created 
---
there are weird edge cases where it will miss. I've noticed with head shots, that VATS will occasionally show 95% accuracy when your are crouching within \~10 feet of a super mutant while perpendicular or behind a super mutant, but all non-critical shots will miss. once you wrap around to their front or they turn towards you, all the shots will land. 
---
well for one it is a large concrete structure held in the air by a ladder that is rusted to hell.
---
Nope. It's flying.
---
Press R to rework broken and clunky system
---
I just think it’s strange to read about “griefing” experiences in the wastelands simply being chalked up to bored players who “have nothing to do.” So instead they actively seek out to upset the gameplay experience for other players in the game. 
---
Sometimes it helps to take a step back from situations, or even video games and get some perspective. Absolutely play another game, or dive into a different hobby. Or seek out some sort of new RL experience.
---
Lol the patches are a joke, any indie company could do a better job.
---
Dude, I haven't played for months and I'm only month three of twelve I said to Bethesda rep in order for them to get their game fixed, before I uninstalled. I have not seen any reason to come back. 
---
It's a tiny thing but did you read the blackberries trick? They're super cheap to replace so you just ring your camp with them. For some reason enemies HATE crops!
---
Oddly enough it doesn't happen to everyone so its possibly related to certain perks or gear.
---
Nope.  He's using the foundation stacking method with a campfire.  Once he got up a few levels, he just stored the lower blocks as they aren't technically holding up the blocks above them.  
---
After seeing the method, I figured this was going to happen.
---
You've banned my account indefinitely after I've been harassed with 13 messages from the person that I had a pvp battle with the last message he sent me was enjoy your ban as seeing as I'm still enjoying it with week number 3 and zero response from bethesda still on any of my tickets that I have put in I'm still waiting for an agent what do I have to do to be able to play the game that I've put over $155 into and 711 hours worth of gameplay on considering I've missed out on all the atomic store stuff now and 3 updates because of some upset player who lost
---
[I know how you feel ](https://imgur.com/gallery/FHyfll7)

 There are hot tubs in the world, but i like your idea. ;)
---
Check out the investigators cabin. Also, maybe these are guidestones [Spoiler: terminal entries with mysteries ](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Investigator%27s_cabin_terminal_entries) 
---
This is why I have mult copies of some cards at different ranks - especially for str perks
---
The reason why I think that's a bad reason is simply because the weight reduction perks are needed and weapon/armor condition perks are needed as well, which is at least 5 points off of perception right there only allowing 10 stars of stuff, not to mention all the lock picking perks so really you're only down to 7 stars to work with. So weapon/armor condition perks cards and lockpicking shouldn't he perk cards but maybe rather passive? Like you shoot rifles enough to know what makes them break so you "handle" them more carefully and they don't break as easily. And lock picking you can always unlock level 3 locks at anytime but as your lock picking increases over the amount of locks you pick increases the sweet spot. Kind of like going back to Oblivions style of leveling up
---
I have no intention of buying atoms, and once something releases and I don't have enough for the item (if I want it) that's when I'll quit the game.
---
I would consider buying atoms if two things changed.
---
1. The items that have already been a part of this Fallout 4 port (outfits/settlement items) are returned to the game as free items.
---
2. They drastically reduce the price below morally insulting to something more reasonable. The current prices are a slap in the face to their loyal customers. It is insulting and I do take offense to the price gouging.
---
3. They release skins/settlement items (like the red rocket) but ensure they are priced at a reasonable level.
---
If Bethesda does all 3 of the above, I'd likely buy atoms in the future. Otherwise they can fuck off.
---
PvP in this game sucks because there's no point or purpose to it. Here's a player-created [suggestion on how to change that](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1djsNSmuRLbpNgyZauhhRQPl3lTSKv6NpKvjPbUPSETM/edit?usp=sharing) by making PvP interesting, structured, and rewarding.
---
How many players max is Anthem? Did Mass Effect 3 eventually get PVP?
---
Definitely Costco.
---
feels even worse when you can't kill one because you're low-level, and one just happens to follow you around as you try to do quests.  
---
It was tense and exciting the first time or two, now it's just an annoyance that makes me waste caps to fast travel somewhere to not do the thing I wanted to do.
---
No ladder. This is the new pillar glitch. It allows you to make flying CAMPs.
---
I agree with the point overall, but just to clarify Bethesda borders both D.C. and the northern Virginia tech corridor. There's a ton of other options.
---
I stepped away a few weeks ago for this very reason. Now I just lurk here waiting to see something that will bring me back in. 
---
Not working hot tubs. 
---
I'm glad it helped you
---
The crib in Abbie's bunker and her messages made me sad.
---
None of them are game breaking? Was the dev room not bugged into multiple.times,causing the best gear to be duped and sold for real money?  Didnt the last patch basically revert.everything theyve done? Stop being a shill. The games fundamentally broken. Theres  no saving it
---
They take too many resources and time to kill with not enough rewards.
---
not sure why anyone would downvote your post, i have also noticed the turrets dont seem to be much help
---
i agree the detection radius needs to be increased, many times it seems the turrets wait a long time to actually start shooting enemies
---
While in the game go to the menu with the photo gallery, atomic shop, etc... (L1 on the map on PS4 - not sure with other platforms).  Theres a "change appearance" option there.
---
Yep, especially considering how much budget they use.  Building a fort and defending with it is a ton of fun, how did they mess it up so badly?
---
Go through your junk in the stash. Look for bottles and other non scrapped stuff.
---
 If you don't junk your stuff at a bench, and just dump it into your stash you will have a lot of items that are not properly scrapped in your stash.
---
Reading and comprehension are fundamental skills that you are missing.
---
Go back and read and stop trolling.

They do use HP Lovecraft horror themes quite often so I could definitely see some plausibility to your theories. Thanks for the post it was interesting.
---
So only with jetpacks or marsupial mutation you can reach this guy's camp.
---
Please up vote, to raise awareness of unknown addiction. 
---
Spot on, that's exactly how I have been with the game as well. But I think the game needs some really big changes to become something worth going back to all the time, a dlc wouldn't cut it I don't think, it would have to be a complete change in the way the game is. 
---
They said themselves they want the game to evolve over time and hopefully it does in some really big ways otherwise it's just going to end up pretty much dead. 
---
Big time help thanks again buddy 
---
If you are going to do that, might as well just make traveling to any station from another station free, because it will be functionally the same as traveling to the next station down the line 4 separate times, but cuts out all the loading screens.
---
I get wanting to add limitations, but in this case might as well cut out the bullshit in order to get the same result.
---
Why, dont you like grinding legendaries at whitesprings, for 1 chance in a MILLION to get the right 3 affixes in a weapon?
---
I soloed it and expected a tedious boring quest. Its really fun actually. Be carefull of assaultron dominators they are very deadly. If you have picklocking 3, you can save time by just lockpicking doors that would need you to do other stuff. 
---
Be sure to quickly repair the pipes, your on a timer. (idk what happens if you fail tho) 
---
Forget about the codes. Decrypting them by yourself seems near impossible, with how complicated it is.
---
Search for the weekly nuke codes on google and dont screw up the code part otherwise you gotta get another key card.
---
I recommend nuking Fissure Site Prime but if you do the Enclave quest you had that in mind before i guess.
---
Check the server first if you actually have people capable of killing the queen. Otherwise time and effort is wasted. 
---
As far as pvp weapon balancing goes, they are making the same mistakes Bungie made with Destiny. OMG people are fucking each other up with x weapon and y weapon, quick cut the balls off of them!!! 3 months later, PVE feels boring and bland as fuck, and has NO decent weapons. Learn from other peoples mistakes Bethesda. Balance weapons separately for each game mode. For fuck's sake.
---
Well based on the discussion I’m having with other players in the replies a lot of others share sentiment that the game isn’t interesting and they’re taking breaks. We’re having a community discussion, where people voice their anecdotes and their opinions and how they feel. It’s not a debate I don’t need anyone to reference research. The most important part of a multiplayer game are the (multiple) players. I want to see how they feel. I didn’t say that fo76 was going to fail I said I was worried, I’m pretty optimistic it won’t actually, I wanted to see how others feel. 
---
You have a gross attitude and it’s not something I really wanted to deal with. So if you want to argue you can do that somewhere else or with someone else. Sorry mate
---
Yep.  There's rdr2, for instance.  I'm still on chapter 3. 
---
My issue is with the naming... “Expert Slugger” and “Master Slugger” get lost in the mix, but if they were named “Slugger (Expert)” at least they would be next to each other alphabetically. This would apply to Rifleman, Heavy Gunner, Picklock etc of course.
---
Remember all the good bye posts everyone was downvotingm
---
See, I don’t know about all that. We have come to an understanding that she’s gonna scream all the time, and I’m gonna pretend she doesn’t exist. Seems to be working so far lol.  
---
Exactly
---
 You have failed to comprehend the distinction between constructive criticism and just plain criticizing. The latter is equivalent to whining and badgering and is not helpful.
---
As far as I can recall, this was the first time I'd run into this trio. As I've said, I've generally had pleasant interactions with other players. As far as video, no, I didn't have anything set up to do recording. It is a bit naive perhaps, but I never really thought it'd be be necessary. 
---
Seems not fair 
---
Hey, don't insult the Skyrim dev team like that, it's a great game. /s (Maybe? Cause I'm 99% sure Scorchbeasts are just reskinned dragons)
---
Yah I feel like some of those people who were mad for people leaving have even stopped playing too. 
---
No one has to lose jobs mate. I also don't get so angry at internet people. Just take a chill pill, no reason to get so upset. A leadership change can be as simple as changing the plan you have in motion for the game. 
---
I love how they chase you forever and can somehow see you, while crouching, through the fucking forest cover, with sneak perk maxed and escape artist perk. Fucking bullshit.
---
[Here](https://redd.it/amgr1f) is a thread that got good reception last week-end. Basically it allows to delete a card to reset a special point (as opposed to leveling up to reset a special point currently). 
---
for me, if a scorch beast starts to attack my base, i just server hop.
---
I got them off Responders or Raiders vendors pre-patch. Post patch I haven't seen them, and haven't seen many other plans that were previously available as well.
---
No.  I bought the fancy bed with earned atoms and it broke my base.  Took me ripping apart and rebuilding twice to confirm the bed was immediately using all budget, and scrapping it didn’t fix.  Once I placed this $7 cosmetic bed in my base, I could never build anything else including replacing with a normal bed.
---
Think about that.  A $7 bed breaks your base 100% of the time.  The stuff that is a rip-off isn’t even tested ONCE.  I never went into the atom shop after this.
---
Yeah, there are three sets of vendor terminals in the Whitespring Bunker (go to Whitespring Service Entrance or Bunker Entrance).  There's the production wing with its own stuff for sale, the armory wing with another set, and the science wing with mostly serums.  All vendors in the bunker share the same set of 200 caps.
---
Agreed.  I can barely tell the difference between day and night unless it's bright and sunny out.  At least give us a slider setting, not so much a gamma setting (though that would also be nice), but to control the darkness of night.
---
So this is a possibility, but the reason i dont think its that is because i saw his mate with him he had a 25 cap bounty when I showed up I was looking for the 400 prioritising him but i had eyes on the 25 bounty while waiting for mr 400 to show himself he dissapeared while i was watching 25. Then when he reappeared he has the EXACT same bounty on his head whats the chance he has the same bounty right after got it cleared youd think it would be different, it only raised when he opened fire on the second camp. A game like this is always going to have griefers,  i dont think its possible to have a system that prevents it without removing pvp, things intended to be anti griefing measures always have loopsholes in a game with so much freedom so i wouldnt blame the system. Also while i dont condone their behaviour they certainly make the game more interesting for people like me.
---
ATM I have well over 3000 atoms, after purchasing several cosmetics, a bed, and a power armor paint. I have never purchased atoms, and don't really see why people would (other than immediate satisfaction.) It's soooo easy to get atoms, just play the game. Gets even easier if you have multiple toons.
---
Love it!
---
See this is exactly what I think of with a good percentage of the new customisations in the atom store. They are trying to compete with fortnite, or at least appeal to the same player base. 
---
Whereas I can’t see much in the store that appeals to their own playerbase or actual fallout fans. 
---
Sure there’s the nuka cola costume and some vault tec painted furniture. But nothing for the factions people find so appealing in a fallout game. Where’s our brotherhood of steel flags or decals or icons. Where’s the enclave camp items, presidential seal rug or x01 enclave  paint. Where’s the raider Pa paint schemes covered in graffiti or smiley faces or camp items hewn from road signs and spikes. Where’s the free states bunker building style plans. The list could go on. They’ve created all these wonderful lore filled in universe factions with huge fan bases, but all they want to sell... is a Hawaiian shirt style suit. 
---
Whining about the Atom Store, I almost said Crown Store, is pretty lame. Don't buy that crap. They ain't getting any of my money, and really I earn Atoms rather quickly.
---
 I need 1400 for PA camo and i have 680 after I bought a lamp. ;) It will take a couple of days.
---
What grind required? It's quite fast and not super challenging to level in this game. How is there a grind?
---
Here's some insight: When you feel like playing a game that has a very normal and at times even giving leveling experience, and you think it's a grind, that's probably because you just don't like that game and should stop playing it.  
---
Yeah I only have 3 tses and I dont even use them 
---
Playing with people on the FilthyCasuals sub might be a good time for you, for me - I stumbled across another Reddit sub on an old hobby and haven’t gamed at all for two weeks now after taking it back up. Best of wishes to you.
---
It's interesting to me how all these posts are vague in the exact same way. They always seem to assert that they got banned, but they have no idea how, and Bethesda hasn't told them despite repeated attempts to contact. I'd be interested to know how you were alerted to your ban in the first place, and what that message said.
---
I agree, maybe make it so only pre orders or Tricentennials can access it but can still invite friends with standard edition maybe?
---
Well. Yes. That's why this will be nerfed to hell and back ASAP and Bethesda will probably break a bunch of other things in the process. This is why we can't have nice things.
---
Although, being a flying CAMP doesn't protect it from being mini-nuked.
---
Yeah i dont think it works when you ate wanted so its either been changed or stealth boys remove you from the map
---
That’s a great idea man thanks 
---
and they take our feedback into 'consideration' and 'bring it up to the developers' and despite 10,000 posts complaining about how items are scrapped or how grindy the game has become they do the opposite.
---
I'm shocked 15 people bought atoms at all. Like in the whole player base. And 15 said yes in this thread.
---
too be honest, it really sucked for the first 20 levels. Lights were also much dimmer and i wasnt able to get a power armor helmet until around level 25. Your pipboy light doesnt work if you're in a PA frame so i was running around with a miner's helmet on and all you could see was a tiny dim circle of light directly in front of you. It was atmospheric, but it also made the game hard as hell to play in the dark. 
---
I'm level 35 and can't even fucking touch one with my shotgun/sniper build. Am I doing something wrong? I just logout, even if I do cripple wings with Enforcer, it would take every single shell I have and more to even bring it to half health. 
---
 Its an FPS game. Please do not waste time on third person.
---
It was reference to getting hardened mass and fluids, you can't get any if infinite loading loot table.
---
Belly of the Beast? Quick Tip: head straight to the Glassed Cavern, ignoring objectives, run through as quick as possible until you find a SB. Look for a transponder nearby. Activate, quest complete.
---
This quest resets if you disconnect or bluescreens and I had that happen three times in a row doing the quest properly. Then I found out that the only important one is the last one. You can always activate the others at a later date to hear the messages, but to get that quest completed quickly, I recommend going straight to the Glassed Cavern, just South-East of Fissure Prime.
---
The phrase 'leadership change' means changing the leadership, not changing a plan of action. 
---
If you're talking about changing a plan of action, write 'changing a plan of action'. English is a language not a guessing game of similitudes. xD
---
you guys need to know that that logic will bite you back, someone will start saying 'we felt COMPELLED to use our perks skill to play the game', so does that men you gonna get rid of your perks system? i mean, without perks we can still play the game...it'll be true to its genre - survival game...
---
Agreed. Not sure whey they make the turrets characters spend their SPECIAL points and budget on to protect their lively-hood are so under-powered, especially when compared against some of the enemy turrets in the game. Not just in HP and DMG output, but in accuracy and agro as well. 
---
My gut tells me they will buff turrets before 'the survival mode comes out'. They'll buff turrets, right?
---
Did not know that was possible. Hell that is pretty funny to me, anyway. So he either fast travels in or marsupial+jumpspacks in?
---
That would imply he blocked me then unblocked me later. Seems unlikely when i didnt enagage him till he got to camp 2
---
Bruh, I think he meant the generator room, the one you have to repair.
---
I need to google robot weak points. I've been killing them all wrong. Thanks for this comment!
---
Thats possible good point
---
Yeah, and I don't have any perk setups for melee. TSE was so popular because the enemies are too fucking spongy. They should have fixed the problem, not nerfed the solution. 
---
Yeah, I've almost never had any issues with other players.  Only things I've had is come back to find all the turrets on my base destroyed, but the rest of the structure standing, and a person who shot me a few times wanting to start something and I just started asking him over voice chat if he had any friends or if this was his only outlet of interaction with people.
---
But I'd probably start up a capture stream if I thought something griefing was going to go down to capture it for public viewing.
---
Scorchbeasts are an awful mechanic. Getting interrupted in the middle of a quest to run away until it stops chasing me or wasting more time fighting it is not fun. It's a worse version of dragons, which also weren't.
---
If your live in a CAMP like this for more than 15 minutes you are legally allowed to move it
---
I stopped playing, that worked well!
---
Roll it back.
---
Fallout 76 of course, do you not have 15 int and the scrapper perk equipped? 
---
If you get a good Troubleshooter weapon (+30% damage to robots) that will help.
---
I wouldn't waste time trying to get Troubleshooter armor.  It will take up too much space and stashes are too small.
---
By the time you get to level 100+ or so you should be able to solo a nuke launch in about 20 mins (maybe a bit more or less depending on how much practice you have).
---
They're missing out on a great cap sink. Keep the move a point method and add a full respec for increasing cap amounts. Reallocate all special points after 50 for 100-200-400-800-1600-3200 etc price resets a week after the last respec
---
Whatever man. I don't see the point in arguing someone who thrives on being a douchebag on Reddit based on your post history. Hope your life cheers up a bit
---
Thats unfortunate, i have a bounty hunting service if youd like to be protected by it and you are on pc pm me if so
---
im pretty sure 2 different teams work on atom shop and fixing/content
---
Sure, this camp needs to be demolished over and over and over
---
  thoughts of bethesda: if it is true, we will charge a lot of money to rent servers 
---
The one that lets you hack robots. If you go in with it maxed out, or someone who has it maxed and shares the card, it makes going through the silo MUCH faster and easier!
---
I played the anthem demo and liked it. Also... no pvp to mess up the game.
---
What faction would you be?
---
I literally hit the mute button on my keyboard when fighting them... Can't stand that spammy sound either. 
---
Well it took them over a week to send me a message telling me I was banned in the meantime everytime I load the game it just gives me a lovely little error code but I finally after a week and a half got a email that said my account was banned indefinitely for duplicating items which I have never done in this game and am now still on week 3 waiting for an agent still to look at my account this all has happened because I had a pvp battle with someone who harassed me with 13 messages and on the last one said to enjoy my ban with a smoochy face and oh boy was he right I've put over 12 messages now to Bethesda updating my ticket and still no response 
---
Platform: PS4  Gamertag:rytur2day
---
I'm in Australia and the the game is unplayable. Depending on what time of day it is you might get 30 mins or 10 mins before server issues. All these patches and they can't even fix up connection problems! You can jam it Bethesda, I'm done!
---
I'm pretty sure there are some videos that link tamriel to fallout earth. In all honesty it is reused assets. But it's fun to theorize the similarities. Kinda like how EA' Dragon Age and Mass Effect share a lot lore/assets. Just a thought 
---
Yeah so either steath works, he left server relogged or blocked me
---
Exactly! At least in the Bethesda era it all started with the Dunwich Building, where there's that weird shrine. I bet they're planning something for a long time and 76 will explore more of that. I mean... I hope so!
---
IMO collecting and breaking down Ore is a waste of time.   So much easier to gather components by just playing the game and scrapping everything you dont sell.  I conserve my acid and cloth for gunpowder.
---
yeah it became normal thing for me, i just muscle them out.
---
I leveled a bunch of alts before the nerfs so i have the max 5 characters all are above 60 except one i just started
---
It’s not a matter of having people to quest with,  it’s a matter of gameplay quality. Daily crashes and disconnects are the main issue for me. In my view it’s unacceptable. Couple that with the lack of interesting and fun content and there really isn’t anything that drives my interest in the game right now. I’ll come back later when it gets better and for now I just follow here to keep updated on changes. 
---
It also seems the turrets in Harper's Ferry are explosive rounds.  Notice that?
---
Know what, ever since I spotted the huge tank style turrets at Monaghan airport I think it is, I really wanted to unlock those for my base. Was super disappointed when I realised you never can. Was looking forward to crafting quite literally better turrets than a rattling tripod with a poor mans minigun on top. 
---
They are always in a rush the top.  
---
*It's the Journey, Not the Destination*
---
I've yet to set a nuke or fight a SBQ, all in good time.
---
the lockpicking and hacking mechanics have been the same since FO3, why would they change them?
---
I feel ya here. Agreed.
---
Except this is Bethesda Austin and not the mother ship. 
---
Sorry you are fragile and can't accept people don't like a thing you like so you need some fantasy that a majority of people agree with you but only you are brave enough to speak out or whatever garbage you are trying to sell with this "I'm the majority" crap
---
You have very low expectations....
---
Gutsy - Thruster
---
Protectron - Arms (they will explode so get away)
---
Assaultron - Legs (their legs are really weak; they'll start crawling towards you)
---
Early on in the game I had about a dozen large water purifiers.  I could clear out 2 or 3 vendors worth of caps pretty easily.  Later in the game, I don't have the camp budget available for that and I use the purified water to make adhesive.   Then again, I just sell my left over bulk adhesive and bulk other stuff.  I'm always picking up plastic.  It's all over the place if you keep a mental note of what to watch for.   
---
Thanks but they patched that bug and those idiots are gone. I can hold my own with a strong melee build. Unfortunately I wasn’t playing that character.
---
So, we often forget that this game is intended to be cooperative, online.  
---
I'm one of those guys that shows up at other people's workshops to get free XP, stuff and plans.  Especially the challenging ones.  The scorchbeasts aren't the issue, the issue is no one came to your aid.
---
His name was Jeffrey Kaplan and it is a well-known fact first of all. Second, if you actually read the content of my post and comments instead of (terribly ironically) and hypocritically criticizing my post baselessly, and consider the meaning of constructive criticism for a second you would notice that my criticism is as constructive as it gets. I am acknowledging that what they have done so far is an amazing base for a game. And third yeah, the anecdote was 100% accurate and that is why he got hired. Try doing your own fact-checking before you call someone out and baselessly criticize their post. Oh, and the "shit people come up with to moan about this game", Terrible fucking english by the way, is being complained about because they are giant fucking problems with a game that could be way better. If this game were as good as it could and should be for 60 bucks people wouldn't complain. Deal with it. 
---
I quit playing because of the scorchbeasts. I wont install it again unless they take the fuckers out or remove their ability to fly. 
---
Not really with Ammosmith lvl2 and SuperDuper lvl3.  Every 2nd or 3rd session I crank out 2000 rounds of 5.56 without breaking a sweat or constant grinding for components.
---
Here is a copy paste of the most petty suggestions from players who hate content:
---
Bethesda needs to hire new people.
---
We should have a Fusion Core regenerator plan
---
Graham is proof that this game would benefit from more NPCs.
---
Idk if this has been said already, but is there a reason purified water isn't treated as boiled water?
---
Passive mode should make it to where other players can’t kill you, destroy your base, or interfere with your gameplay at all.
---
Legendary effects should be craftable
---
Can we get a roof piece to make bigger warehouses roofs more consistent?
---
[Console] - Can we get the ability to store more than 50 photos?
---
I’m quite tired of having to constantly have weight reduction perk cards taking up special points just to be able to manage my carry weight
---
A machinist shop capturable workshop where you can take steel and convert it into a choice of gears, springs, or screws would be cool.
---
Please let screws be one of the materials gained from scrapping weapons, like in FO4.
---
Free Fast Travel between stations?
---
All Bulked Items Should “Weigh” Less than the Sum of Their Components. 
---
Travel Agent perk-lvl2 move your camp for free or at a reduced price. Lvl3 fast travel while over encumbered(free or pay caps)
---
Instead of expanding the storage limit, how about craftable Stash boxes with weight reducing properties? 
---
This would probably bring me back to 76. If we were able to wage war against opposing factions.
---
As someone posted on here before, they’ve spent so long working out how to maximise inventory space so they can run everywhere as fast as the wind, they’ve ran out of places to run.
---
Pretty sure they come out on Friday's. Don't quote me.
---
Yeah same, I only even have 2 poimts in fireproof and it does next to zero damage. Of course once it gets nerfed or fixed all the whiny babies will be crying about how much damage they are doing since the game is only fun if you one shot all monsters while taking zero damage.
---
Unfortunately I find it happens a lot, in random places nowhere near fissures :(
---
You just don't get it.
---
The title of this thread is about the world feeling empty, and you go on to state that you're afraid the game will die. It's a fully pessimistic and negative thread at its core. If you think that invites 'community discussion' of any value, I don't know what to say. What it invites are all the negative whiners that have come into this sub lately. Anyone who has a positive outlook is not likely to read this thread based on its title, let alone actually reply to what amounts to a steamy pile of speculation and complaints. 
---
You may not like my attitude, but that doesn't change what this thread is. Take a look through the replies to your 'discussion' and tell me how many balanced or positive replies it's had. It's full of people saying the population is shrinking with no rational evidence, just a lot of anecdotes, and people talking about their various problems with the game.
---
It's a misery circle-jerk. Have fun with that. I'm sure it's going to make you feel very 'optimistic' about the game. xD
---
There are a bunch of trolls from /r/Fallout that downvote every single thread on /r/FO76 and /r/FO76FilthyCasuals. 'Sprobably them.
---
Roar 1000x
---
It jumps around, but the pattern has been Thursdays lately.
---
Nope just using basic common sense.  A game so historically bad that's it's become an industry meme isn't going to keep a playerbase.  How many times do we hear "this game is trash" "I'm done with this game" "I've put in x amount of hours and I'm finished with this"? From personal experience my friends lasted maybe a week and decided to uninstall.  I put in about 60 hours and couldn't accept it for what it was/is in its current state.  But that's just anecdotal and I understand that.  But let's put the koolaid down for 1 sec and think this through.  Do you really think a game that has new issues every single week is going to be sustainable?
---
Do you think 76 with its launch problems, anti consumer practices,industry wide meme status, continued patch errors, lack of any sustainable content, is going to INCREASE its DAUs? The answer is no.  
---
"The only way to win is not to play."
---
Yes, there are literally documents in the military wing at whitespring lying around on the floor that tell you what becomes what
---
I was in there for over an hour both times (reloaded off other players on the map to force a respawn). I was able to get 4 respawns before I froze and crashed. 
---
&gt;Survival mode
---
Battle Royale
---
o rly?
---
No, you're a little low.  Wait until level 50 to expect to handle them.
---
You need level 3 hacker, but also if you have level 3 lockpick, you can avoid some parts of the route to the launch room and bypass one of the intermediate quests.  There are some materials requirements as well for the intermediate quest stages - you don't have to have the junk with you but it has to be in your stash if not.  And you must have a launch keycard - get a quest to shoot down a cargo bot to get one from the same terminal that gives you the quest to find the officers with the quest pieces.  More than one launch card might be good in case you make a typo on the launch code.
---
I have only launched once but it was solo, and I managed it when I was somewhere around level 65-70 (I forget exactly), so it can be done.    
---
You can get the week's codes at nukacrypt once they're solved.  Before I did my first launch, I went and got all 8 pieces for a given silo and got the keyword and did all the decryption once on my own to have done it because I'm a nerd like that, but then I checked my answer against the launchcode on nukacrypt. 
---
There is really no point arguing with *these* people, they get a boner from constantly bitching, it's just what they do.
---
Classic
---
I've definitely noticed a steep decline in nuke zones this week. A couple weeks ago people were nuking a lot of places other than whitespring and prime fissure but this past week it's back to the old spots and only very rarely. 
---
 I figured you were just pulling that out of your ass.
---
 But ... but I deduced that was true. ROTFLMFAO!
---
Hmm... It's either Responder or Brotherhood. My main character is more suited for the former, but my friends certainly would want to go as the latter- so likely the Brotherhood, when faction warfare does roll up.
---
THE HOOKS ME BOY! THE HOOKS!
---
They aren't exactly whats in the picture, the raiders chopped their head off and hooked them up
---
Oh man I agree with you all! What BS this is!
---
I have seen some nukes but I am nowhere near end game. Finally hit Level 30 and haven't ventured into the Savage Divide... well i did once, a few levels ago, but left when i realized my mistake. I have only been down a third of the way into Ash Heap. I don't play daily and by the time I "see the end," I will have felt that I got my money's worth. Not saying the game is perfect, but I am enjoying it. It's not often that I beat a game and keep replaying it. That is 1 disappointment with this game, since player choice doesnt affect the world much anymore, I don't really think I will replay the story which I have done with previous fallouts.
---
Thought they always weighed .5. 
---
You won’t be able to breaks it, concrete blocks are indestructible and you can’t get in with jetpack, unless there is a ladder to step up, which is removed once the owner is inside.
---
I started to read all this but then I remembered 90% of the game is just recycled fo4 assets so it probably means nothing.
---
This morning I was over near whitesprings and saw a scorchbeast so I figured I'd go help take it down.  It died and got entangled in the power pylon, out of the reach of all of us who'd killed it.  \[sad panda meme here\]
---
Yes! I forgot about that place! You're absolutely right, maybe the faces are the "guidestones"! Good thinking! Also, the Atlas observatory is obviously a place of importance. The terminals show something about a secret project that changes weather (the fallout equivalent to HAARP?). It seems like there's a lot of terminals to be used there. Again, I bet it will be something as big as the nuclear launches.
---
Well, I don't normally nuke the Queen unless I know I have a good chance of actually being able to kill her - e.g. I'm online with high level friends. When I'm farting around by myself I find it's not a good use of my time - there are better places to farm violet flux, which is literally the only thing I need right now.
---
I’ve heard about it but I also heard not all plants can be planted in all zones. I haven’t checked if WS can plant them but I likely also don’t have the budget left.
---
Maybe one of my razergrain plants will do, all crops are cheap because you scrap what they cost to build exactly.
---
There are some pretty common bugs with 64 bit operating systems in Fallout 3. Did you ever try any of those fixes? 
---
Just wait.  Danse is coming.
---
I’d like to know how someone could even rig the system against you in the way you described. Surely somebody in this sub could offer info or speculation about it. Is there a reporting system they could spam against you with their friends? Does Bethesda ban people based upon negative player feedback?
---
When i scroll over to the sparse roleplay subreddit i can't help but think it's on us to make end game content and up to them to afford us freedom and options.
---
Fascinating fact. Didn't know that. That actually explains a WHOLE lot.
---
Yawn...
---
I think that being that this is a survival game, the turrets are meant to assist, not clean out your enemies for you while you just chill in your camp. Also, it depends where you have them set up and where your camp is. The game / map is pretty broken so I’ve noticed they work better or worse depending on how you position them and where your camp is on the map. 
---
I think that calling for someone to get fired is a bit extreme when this is a non issue compared to 5000 other things in the game that are actually broken. 
---
Shooting flying fucks in the face is easy 
---
My favorite part is how they will peel off from any kind of engagement to follow you halfway across the map faster than you can run. I had three spawn at a power plant down a cliff and several hundred yards from my camp through no fault of my own and yet they all saw me from inside my camp and decided to visit.
---
Recently runescape came out of mobile phones, had to go back and make a new character 
---
I'm 90% sure you are a casual who doesn't understand how this game and the perks work.
---
I notice maybe 1 low level player per server (lvl 2-25), which usually appear to be an alt. And then a couple lvl 50s, and the rest lvl 80+. 
---
It is a bit weird. 
---
It does mean that farming the Queen can be easier than a month ago, since less lower lvls show up. 
---
But, the world feels uncomfortably empty. 
---
OP as fuck... whenever I start getting hit by one I can’t even move to get away and they tear through armor / health 
---
That sucks. I used over 300 concrete, and a bunch of lead extractors, and I played for about 12 minutes before I had to leave the game. I wish they could have fixed this.
---
It certainly would bring a lot more action and drama to Appalachia. Heck, it would even make using nukes a bit more interesting- rather than just farming the Scorchbeast Queen and Whitesprings. The true Appalachian arms race!
---
I spent $25 on Atoms one night when I was really drunk. Whoops.
---
How sad is your life that THAT is what made you roll on the floor laughing? 
---
It's a historically bad game and your happy about that?  Well alright then. 
---
Isn't that the same face at the bottom of that creepy ghost quarry in Fallout 4?
---
Don't keep more than a few armor and weapons in the stash.
---
Establish your most used materials.
---
Establish values for all raw materials that you want to stay around.
---
You do not need 500 of anything in there.
---
Personally ive seen people queue once but then when it was 4/4 everyone left
---
Does Perception have anything to do with VATS accuracy?
---
At least Star Citizen is starting to have hints of a good game in the demo.
---
The Mothman cultists wound up in the Lucky Hole Mine because they were trying to escape a flood the Mothman warned them about. I don't think the Mothman told them to go to the mine, he just gave them a warning and they wound up there.
---
That may be the only connection between Mothman and interloper.
---
It was my first reaction too! But here's the thing: These assets are used very sparingly in F76 and F4. It seems they're used deliberately on certain locations, like the mining family's home and the Dunwich mine. I bet there's more to it.
---
Shouldnt be because you were over-encumbered. I was at almost 900 lbs and had no issues re-spawning, I am on PC though....
---
Hurry up and wait.
---
I've been getting this, and now I'm stuck with it, cannot log in any more. Validated game and reset network.
---
Did they take down the severs??
---
See I just don't buy that you got banned for duping when you say you've never duped. You seem to be implying that this mystery person somehow has the ability to flag your account to be banned, which seems highly unlikely. And you seem to think the whole thing occurred because you beat them in PvP, they got mad and sent you a bunch of harassing messages, then somehow made Bethesda ban you? I dunno.  I really feel like I'm missing part of the story involving the harassing messages... you seem pretty confident that the ban stems from that, but you make no mention of your conduct or how you responded to the messages, which makes me suspicious.
---
Ive seen ppl queue once i joined and then when it was 4/4 everyone left

"Let's Make The Purified Water Turn Black"
---
 Guys like you always crack me up. So sure ... so wrong.
---
&gt;TL;DR is TL;DR
---
That isn't constructive feedback and it isn't funny.  That is a complaint which was handled summarily and in a way that should have been short enough for even the most lazy to read and 
---
I think something changed somewhere.  
---
My first long term C.A.M.P. I had two shotgun turrets and a spotlight between them.  They tore up everything that came near the base.  A couple weeks later they were really having trouble.  I think it's their "detection" calculation.  
---
Now, when I take a workshop, I make sure to have overlaps, rather than just covering arcs.  Because if just one turret spots someone, they all seem to know it's there.  
---
Frustrating.
---
Proof?
---
I was just down in the Lucky Hole mine the other day, and when you reach the sleeping beast, there is a subtle, persistent buzzing you can hear. 
---
Also, some thoughts: I dont think the sleeping creature is the interloper, but a minion of it. No real proof, it just seems kind of small to be the entity at the center of all this.
---
Next, I dont think the Mothman cult worshipped the interloper, at least not knowingly. I think they worshipped the Mothman, but either the Interloper... interloped and co-opted their worship, or their belief in/knowledge of the supernatural opened the way for them to begin worshipping the interloper, or at least allowed someone to.
---
Remember, the cult of mothman was near completely wiped out when they climbed onto their roofs to escape the (future Charleston) flood, and instead got nuked. Only that one guy whose' name I don't remember left town hunting the Interloper. 
---
The giant bronze faces I absolutely love. They remind me of the Temple of Trials in Fallout 2, and some of the buildings in DC in fallout 3. That said, they also remind me of Lorenzo's crown in Fallout 4.
---
This could tie them into the ancient aliens believed to have lost cities buried on earth, including somewhere in the mojave. I have long suspected that the Tunnelers of the Divide are actually degenerated denizens of that lost alien city, woken up and turned loose by the destruction. Nothing to really base this on, I just like this idea and it sort of fits.
---
Next, on the topic of underground dwellers, I also suspect the Mole Miners may have a connection to the Interloper. They heavily populate Lucky Strike mine, live deep beneath the earth and may have some comnection to Garrahan mining, and are generally creepy. Tying into the other theory people have about mole miners being children, perhaps their parents were miners or cultists who were 'called' to the mines when the bombs fell, taking their children and family with them. Over time the adults changed and eventually died and their children began wearing their parent's mining gear, inundated with whispers from the dark, finding friendship with the mole rats they shared the tunnels with, and never knowing what it was to be truly human.
---
And on the topic of Garrahan, I recall finding a ritual bindings outfit somewhere in the estate, so that further supports the connection between the bronze faces and the cult. I wonder if there was another secret society, deeper and darker than the Enclave. Perhaps founded by explorers like Lorenzo Cabot who discovered ancient alien or lovecraftian power within lost cities and used this to form a secret society.
---
Might be kind of cool if they were even opposed by the Enclave in secret shadow wars, maybe tied into the Great Game mentioned in Point Lookout.
---
And last, but certainly not least, I kind of hope they never shine a spotlight on any of this stuff. I hope they keep adding hints, mysteries and unexplained phenomena like this, that builds upon itself and can be pieced together (partially) but always exists as hidden easter eggs or secrets on the fringe. I love this mystery and unknown, and would hate to see us start farming the Interloper for 4* Legendaries or what have you.
---
So pretty much aim for the head? 
---
oh. nvm. 
---
Do you have any verifiable proof I'm wrong? 
---
Tbf the ones on relay stations are also dumb as rocks. 
---
Constructive criticism is made to improve something with specific suggestions and rational/supportive comments. Your post isn't about that. It's just about crying in the hopes that something changes. You didn't provide any suggestions or optimistic or positive comments, you just blabbed on about how embarrassing the game is and wondered how it happened. 
---
It's nowhere near 'as constructive as it gets', and I have to giggle that you'd write such a stupid comment. You must not have seen very much constructive criticism in your life.
---
I'm also not going to fact-check your absurd claims. Here's a little principle that intelligent people accept: The burden of proof is on the person who makes the claim. If it's so well-known that this guy was hired because of his crabbing on a forum (as opposed to, you know, job assets and qualifications) then you should be able to easily provide conclusive proof of your claim.
---
Last comment: You actually took a moment to try to criticize my use of English and it's beautiful. Not only is it totally irrelevant to our exchange, which makes you seem desperate, you actually comma spliced, capitalized 'Terrible' for no reason, and then didn't capitalize 'English'. Good god, dude. Pick yourself up and just accept that you made a whine post. xD
---
LOL
---
The only turrets I've ever used that didn't suck were the missile turrets and that might be more because of the splash damage than anything. Targeting is definitely wonky with any turret depending where the enemy is. Not too high, not too low, not too far and with a clear line of sight. Sometimes the turrets will still derp out a little bit.
---
I want the outcome to be better than 20 caps.  20 caps for lost flux (and the time that represents) is ridiculous to call PvP.  
---
I think it is! If you look closer, the face lines seem to be the same! I'm not super sure, but to me it matches.
---
i love having the defend X workshop from SB.  it's a decent deterrent for other players to try and take the workshop.  its like my own personal guard bat
---
Thus will, undoubtedly, be the best reply by far. 
---
Oh hells yeah.  Go on up to that region and start spotting all the ferns (not mutated ones) that don't let you do anything with them in the regular world.  Nuke that open plain and set of hillsides between the workshop and the water park and you can just hop from plant to plant with essentially nothing trying to kill you.
---
On that note though, get your hardened mass, glowing mass, and high radiation fluids from Whitespring in a separate nuke.
---
what is wrong with me lilly please fuckin help 
---
I think the difference from this and mmo is the lack of impact. I feel like the quests I had very little investment in. It’s all chasing ghosts and not making any change in the future world. It’s like this is all made to be forgotten. When I leave I become a ghost of Appalachia. My camp disappears and there is nothing of me left in that world. Not even a holotape to tell my story.
---
I still don't understand why we can't properly trade them with each other, it seems like a natural thing to do. If they're worried about people getting super powered right from the start through it, they could always make certain cards or trading itself level-gated.
---
Filthy and Casual.  Very nice and do you have bourbon?
---
My point is that he didn't even try to harm me, so how could he know it was on?  I can tell when I'm being shot by other players.  He wasn't shooting.  He was playing musical instruments and looking around.
---
What stops people griefing with structures?  I don't follow your point.
---
Stay in the Forest until you fully explore there, don't worry about the main quest. That will be around for a good while and doesn't care what lvl you are
---
I did a quick run through Whitesprings this morning, and encountered several Unruly Golfers, so remembering how difficult it was to find them back at level 30ish, I checked the map to find the player who spawned them, thinking I could kite some to them, or let them know where to find them.
---
But upon checking the map I realized there was only one other player in the area, and they were more than twice my 120ish level, to make matters worse, as I moved around the place, the spawns were very off, some at level 9, 38, 48, 68, &amp; a few at 91, with none of the 5 legendaries I killed spawning any legendary items.
---
&gt;Imagine if there were way more, way cool things to do with caps, and there were like 4-8 man contests that sporadically spawn and give like 1000 cap pots to the winner. Wouldn't that be awesome? Instead, they put out the dullest shit imaginable.  
---
&gt;"Didn't make any suggestions"
---
inside in the atom store coming soon 
---
 What a stupid leading question. 
---
 No figures have been released by Bethesda so there is nothing but speculation. 
---
Yeah, I've seen them, and I'd rather have the lasers than the rockets, which might trash my own stuff...
---
Oh ok
---
I never saw them indicated at 0.05 each?  I mean, I'd love it if they were that low... but they've always been 0.5 for me.
---
Beth can give us content or patches for every petty thing you can come up with. Their time is finite. I'd like to imagine more content.
---
Are all Ultracite mods available for purchase? Which vendor?
---
I think currently energy weapons do low damage. The devs have it in their queue to look at. A lot of the heavy weapons arent great either, but some are Ok.
---
It may, but I’d expect that to just adjust the % up, not flat out lie to you. 
---
Like with higher per I’d expect vats to allow 95% out to greater range, or allow it to exceed 95%. Not show you 95% but only give you 50 and you’re just supposed to “know” it’s reporting falsely because your perception sucks
---
The latter.
---
You have the perk to lower the weight of drinks when you're carrying them but it doesn't apply to the stash.
---
Yeah, but then you're actively looking for them versus just popping in and out. Also the ones you find in the wild aren't 100%. 
---
I kinda like the low level of players on each server. I don't want the first M of MMORPG to apply to 76.
---
But dangerous areas where the good loot is... I'd go for that. Kinda like what they did in Ultima Online on the Fel side (PVP) shards. 
---
" You must not have seen very much constructive criticism in your life. " 
---
That's adorable seeing as I have a B.A. in English Literature and studied criticism for 5 years.
---
There needs to be a weapon similar to Dragonrend in Skyrim, it would make Scorchbeast fights a hell of a lot easier. 
---
 Have you paid any attention to weapons and armor? What level are you?
---
Yes, to me it's still a mystery. Could be just a coincidence of cults, but I don't know. Maybe the Interloper appears in the form imagined by the cultists? Like Gozer from Ghostbusters? 
---
What level are you, it is pretty hard from 1-15, get the raider PA at level 15, things should start to ease up. Make sure you getting the right perk cards and building your strength tree. Melee is the best earlier choice and you can move into weapons during or later.
---
Legs are better for the Protectrons. Ghouls head shots are fine, but it's better to kneecap them if you're getting rushed. For Mirelurks the claw is an easier target and it's almost as squishy has the head. 
---
Stay in the forrest for a while until you reach a higher level with better items. Pick up every weapon you find and scrap them to unlock mods. Get the charisma perk card lone wonderer if your playing solo to take less damage and pharma pharma to find more aid items and persevere. What platform are you on?
---
Haven't played for weeks, still doesn't mean I'm going to forget about it. Bethesda launched a product and charged a AAA price for that.
---
Give them money the forget they ripped me off? erm no thanks.
---
I've had scorchbeasts attack me like that, like they just spawned just for me.   It really makes you feel lucky to be attacked by bullet sponges that drop such useful plans like your 40th copy of the same damn thing you got 39 other times.
---
They aren't worth the time or resources to take them down, even if you can kill them in 3 to 6 shots with a 3 star legendary black powder rifle and quite frankly that is the ONLY way I've found to deal with them in a sane manner.
---
They would weigh .05 in your inventory if you have Rank 3 Thru-Hiker but .5 in your stash because perk effects don't affect items you aren't carrying
---
F76 playerbase:"...But there is so much do and see after level 50 when you are done with quest". Ofc the player will leave if build your game to be single player game that is online. Singleplayer games don't last months, they last days. That is why games like ESO and WoW have raid and dungeons and PVP, that keeps you entertain so long that they can build new expansion.
---
And the thing is, F76 playerbase want to game be even more shorter, by making legendaries craftable, rare materials being common, increasing cap income, lowering cap outgoing. 
---
I think the combat processor in their backs is the weak point. 
---
Also those big assault bots with the fusion cores in them die instantly if you damage them. With concentrated fire, you don't have to wait for them to overheat to expose the core. You just keep shooting until 0% turns into 95%
---
I think the weak spot for deathclaws is their belly.
---
I did t know at first found out later after nuke
---
Yeah, I get that. was just a thought, cause I have 15 in Perception... and I do miss in VATS sometimes, but not "every" time.... and I thought maybe that had something to do with it? 
---
Ah.  Ya.  Perks don't count in Stash unfortunately.  0.1lb Stimpacks back up to 1.0 in stash.  Junk weighs so much more in the Stash, always throws me off when I go to put 10lbs in the stash and it's so much more.
---
I love it when you scrap em and get no plans... The handmade is the same
---
Only thing that's the same is hacking. FO4 changed it to the perk chart thing for higher level locks. For a single player game that works fine, but fo76 where youre locked behind a certain amount of points having perks that are a necessity is wasting spots for a perk you want. So making it a challenge to aquire them helps balance it out
---
They were referring to how assaultrons don't need to charge their laser. And can fire constantly for some reason. It makes it so you can't be in thrir line of sight fir extebded periods of time.
---
Or you just server hop at Hemlock and see if someone has already built a non locked extractor.  I found even if it’s unclaimed the built structures still remain.  You can harvest the actually nodes and the extractors themselves.
---
The issues with the game outweighed the fun factor for me. Now Im only logging in periodically to collect junk and sell to increase my caps on hand and that is basically it. I really hope Bethesda turns it around and releases some good content, but right now there isnt much left for me.
---
&gt;Don't even get me started on charred ghouls. 
---
whats wrong with charred ghouls...?
---
Lmao did you just call your own original question stupid?  Woo boy.  This is good.   Come on just use common sense like a big girl and at least give me your koolaid explanation. 
---
im 14 but i can’t even fucking tell what the main quest is or what quests i’m doing I just do whatever is the closest to me when I spawn in it’s like a fucking puzzle of me just walking around doing random shit and not knowing what the story is
---
lol at that last comment. I'm having fun with the game, I don't need cheering up. As to my post history, I've spent part of the morning pointing out flaws in the arguments of people who are mucking up the 76 reddit with complaints, so I have to ask-- did you actually take a minute to read the context of any of my replies? 
---
Naw, you didn't. And that's why you have no idea wtf you're talking about. I don't thrive on being a douchebag, I'm just casually killing time before breakfast by criticizing people who are themselves criticizing. 
---
The big thing many whiners don't seem to get: Your critical thoughts are not immune to criticism.

Blah Blah Blah Burden of proof. Shut up.

This isnt even a parody...
---
Let's just go play OSRS. That's what I was playing before 76 lol
---
Yep.  Sad fact, when one of those pricks shows up, you're usually forced to just leave the server and screw whatever you were involved in.
---
Last night I was just at a railroad station minding my own business and ready to head off down the tracks to the next station when a scorchbeast started their shit on me. I instinctively equipped my sniper rifle and got off a few rounds until I noticed it was level **82**!  Logged off as fast as I could before I died.
---
you can fix it by dropping all your celks and picking them back up.
---
If you're on PC, load the mod that reduces their visual effects.  It makes it a lot less of a light-shit-show.
---
Yea, im lvl 24 and stuck on the Mayor quest when i have to upload the program at the top of that building.  A lvl 50 scorchbeast spawns, and fucks me up.   How the hell do i kill that thing at lvl 24? All the other waves of mobs i am fighting are in the 30's....How does this lvl 50 make its way into a lowbie quest? 
---
Hit Grafton and kill the mutants, they drop gun powder regularly and pipe rifles when scrapped give 5 steel. I get between 15-20 pipe rifles a run. If you need lead afterwards, a good node of 3 or 4 lead and the excavator armor will give you 4 ore each time and you get multiple picks at them. 
---
You can never sell ammo to vendors
---
What a terrific find.
---
Be steel my heart! I do nut know if I can handle all this screwing around. I'm starting to think we all might have a few springs loose...
---
It could. But if that’s the case then the vats system is bugged, and is seriously mis reporting chance to hit.  
---
It’s a valid comment, and something to consider, would love someone from thesda to weigh in on if vats misreporting is a thing tho. 
---
I know where to find all the mats. Was just saying that I always seem to run out of one or the other but not both
---
 What a terrific find. 
---
I actually found my missing piece, but thanks fam
---
how do get any power armor ?? shit is so fucking hard can’t find anything 
---
Just got The Inspector outfit and am experiencing the same issue.  I only have the resistant lining, but still...
---
The game barely has working server's, add hot tubs into the mix and it will self destruct :(
---
Serious answer is that they weren't in Fallout 4 so they could copy and paste them in.
---
DOH, that's it. I have the Agility perk that lowers food and drink by 90%. Double DOH. 
---
Lol I have dozens of explosive weapons. How the hell do you think the bloodied pump does 600dmg? It’s not from just bloodied alone lol. And people reporting this bug are not saying it’s only explosive weapons, they are saying it’s all weapons. Sounds like you’re the troll here.
---
🤤 
---
whats wrong with charred ghouls? I can 2 (sometimes) 3 shot them at 88.  Scorchbeasts are another story :/  
---
And bears.. And snally gasters.  
---
Some of the balance is whack
---
&gt; It will give me about 50 for a solo Scorchbeast
---
?  No it won't.  Just one time, if that was the last large creature you had to kill for that specific one-time challenge.
---
Once you have all the challenges and quests done, the only way to get any more atoms is with Daily's and Weekly's.
---
Why
---
Not tin foil. This is the only explanation that makes sense.
---
Horrible management decisions + tangled code + inexperienced coders.
---
Springs, Gears and Screws are the most valuable, I rarely throw away junk, but I will sell too much of something and drop bone and glass if I have to and cork.
---
Yeah, you know, though, that those sad, few hardcore among us who manage to stay with the game will be in Utopia.   
---
Some 5+ years from now...
---
The selection really is pretty poor. I keep wondering if I somehow skipped a page when browsing through, but there really just is not much on offer, let alone much that's interesting or worth actually paying real money for. 
---
but i love server hopping to find a sugar grove that hasn't been eviscerated yet.  
---
GlobeNFanHunter3000 right here.
---
Yes, please?
---
Sonic spam, annoying and just awful. Too often the scorch beast just glitches and screams. Fireproof does help, good tip. 
---
Definitely Tank up on health Perks, you will need it when all your low damage Energy weapons are broken, and you will also want to get Rusty Knuckles for that PA, since you will be doing a lot of unarmed fighting.
---
I know that sounds funny, and/or sarcastic, but I'm being serious, 
---
Also I have some really nice (or should be) 3\* energy weapons I could sell you for that build.
---
Yep, and apparently I had the I'm An Idiot perk card active at the time as well. 
---
that may be true but things like Plasma cores for the Plasma heavy gun are so damn easy to make.
---
I didn't respond to the messages this person sent me and I dont know why they would say I duplicated either but that's what the email said in response to my ban
---
🤣 yeah they suck. I've literally been in that situation with the abandon bog town. I had to clear mole rats to claim the workshop. Got attacked by 3 scorchbeasts for the defense. I put up every turret I could afford and repaired them like crazy. Never even killed a single one. They never landed. I used all my resources. That's when I decided to spec my melee with a secondary heavy guns and a prime Gatling gun. 😂
---
But my stealth sniper is pretty much a scorchbeast Hunter, I usually kill them in 5-7 shots depending how many critical and sneak attacks I can get in. 
---
So there's that. Lol
---
Same issue when bringing them out of inventory to repair or upgrade, or change to for specific tasks.  Some people like to min/max the DR types.  
---
I wear the Ultracite for the overall protection, but the Excavator when I'm on a junk run.
---
Definitely make the wasteland feel more alive when you're out exploring and all of a sudden you end up in the middle of a firefight 
---
&gt;The nonstop spam is bullshit.
---
this was confirmed to be a bug, no? like... at least a few weeks back. i remember reading something about it. someone confirm it?
---
This makes so much sense that it'll never happen.
---
HA!
---
All my outfits that I use to dress up my female characters that I, as a man, use as a means of "preferring to look at a womans ass when playing" as an excuse for my closet homosexuality using a female avatar as a metaphor. 
---
I was in a "world" all to myself last night.  It was kinda late (around midnight PST) but still, you'd think other people would be on... 
---
I stopped playing about 2 months ago and I don't miss it. I still go and play FO4 lol, more of an enjoyable game imo.
---
Maybe I usually sell water since I have like 60 purifiers with me on average.
---
No way they drain fast.
---
Nothing more valuable then stash space for me.   Everything goes that i don’t need or use.  
---
i've slowed down a ton in the last 2 weeks. i had to take a business trip and took 5 days off. ever since i came home i log in and have NO idea what my purpose is.
---
there's nothing to do as a level 88 in the game that isn't repetitive with no actual end goal
---
but like I said before the Plasma cores etc are so easy to make and I plan on taking full weapon degradation boosts and over repair perks.
---
Yeah I can’t fight the scorch beasts without getting sick. :(
---
Take a look at my post from yesterday that the devs commented on they are aware an asked for my personal information because they are trying very hard to find where the source of it is. You also keep saying "new" it's not a "new" bug its returning from previous patch.
---
Last time I was on, I saw a turret shooting a junk extractor.  There must have been a mob spawned inside the junk extractor, or the turret lost it's ever loving mind.
---
I dont know why people always bring up NMS. It's still not a very good game and it's basically unplayed other than brief periods after a content drops. Steamchart shows drops down to less than 1000 avg player counts.
---
That's no excuse. Communicate.
---
Thursday
---
 springs and screws. I have 200 of each 
---
shotgun and enforcer makes it super easy to kill them to be honest. i'm seeing a nerf coming, and soon.
---
seriously, with enforcer perk, you unload like at most 20 shells, then they either land or bug in the air. then kill them, because in this mode they don't move, attack, or do anything. they just exist like bullet sponges that eventually die.
---
I absolutely hate the turrets at Harper's Ferry.  Those things piss me off with how much damage they do compared to the crap that we get at our camp with a maxed out Home Defense card.   Higher Home Defense should mean we get the best turrets, not just more expensive turrets.
---
I'm not. My first two points are valid, i'm level 121 and have spent multiple hours in this game. I'm saying that pulling shit like this without a respec is a dumbass move on bethesda's part
---
PA is everywhere, again what is your level ? If you between 15-25 grab the Raider PA, you can get it on the mountains between WhiteSpring Resort and Flatwoods, easy to get to, safe to get to. You can build a full set of level 15 PA with about 10 server hops. I have a video if you need.
---
The most common PA spawn is at the railyard by morgantown, in fact there are two PA spawns very close to each other, one at the railyard in a train cart at the front of the building and one is a little away down by Mama Doce in one of the warehouse buildings, PA spawns in both places very often. Most will be T51, T45 etc, T45 you can ware at level 25, T51 I believe begins at either Level 30 or 35.
---
Get a Power Armor Chassis and everything will be easier.
---
lmfao
---
I had 3 camping me and I was around lvl 20
---
They are simply stating they are aware of an issue. Not that said issue is due to a dmg bug. And you must have not been around for the old dmg bug because it in no way worked like the one you have described.
---
Same thing happened when I took over an ammo factory. 3 fucking scorchbeasts attacked. I waited till they were far away and fast travelled to 76 when they were swooping back
---
Wait, trifold give you ballistic fiber?
---
Shit...
---
Awesome reply! I agree with everything! As for the Interloper "creature", to me it's a thing that's growing. Those vines in the shrines must be some clue to that. Maybe the creature is the Earth itself! And remember the shrines neat Vault 76: They have a different vine with thorns and are now "emanating".
---
And I think you're right about that Lorenzo's crown. It seems very similar to the faces in Whitespring. It could definitely be something alien!
---
Mole miners being children: Man, that would be super creepy!
---
Equip bandolier and just carry all ammo. I have 10s of thousands of various bullets and it takes up like 10 lbs total
---
I only launched 1 nuke and i fast traveled out
---
I didn’t find out for a long time since every time I launched a nuke id port out then I realized the door up top opens 
---
Agree. Doesn't seem tinny to me.
---
I dumped this game not long after NY and I dont see myself going back. There is no reason to play fo76 anymore over FO4 because it's so bad and grindy it's no longer fun coop.
---
If you really want to have fun coop you are dramatically better served by the BL franchise.
---
One would be perfect for my patio. 
---
Anti-Armor is currently bugged with Explosive, it isn't doing as much as it should be, someone said it's because AA doesn't modify the explosive damage. Really only matters with things like the Queen with high explosive resistance
---
I’m not doing math for you kid, sorry, if you can’t discern the simple ratios taken from the stated data then you need to go back and take middle school math.
---
I only launched 1 nuke and fast traveled out
---
I used in game Atom rewards to buy one outfit...but will never buy atoms or cash shop items in a full price game, using real money.
---
I had two of them follow me from the ash heap to white springs and would wait outside every building I went into that required a load screen while still reading (danger). They eventually started attacking the bots so I could fast travel away 
---
Bonus damage for those wearing our newly introduced Institute Jumpers. 
---
 LOL. I never do challenges. I don't do events and I accumulate Atoms fairly quickly.
---
If you dont use missles or mini-nukes, drop them. That was a game changer for me that I never thought about. Also maxed bandolier is worth it, but doesnt sppky to missles and nukes. Those things are 2 and 6 lbs each, respectively.
---
Well they technically are a copy paste of the Skyrim dragon. 
---
I use a full core in the 8 minutes Uranium Fever takes.  I use at least 2-3 fighting SBQ.  Do you even use PA?
---
I keep seeing references to Beth's response, but I haven't seen it anywhere. Would happen to know where I can find it?
---
Completely agree.. and I'm sick of wasting gears to fix them every time I come to my camp.. 
---
Also, does anyone know if there's any way to level them up from Mk. I ??  Just seems foolish.. 
---
+250 DR is a tertiary effect though
---
 At this point you are just babbling. Have a nice day.
---
&gt; . Granted this one is more about grinding than actual exploration.. And has no challenging dungeons.. But fuck it's still cool.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I can't wait to see where it is in a year or two.
---
&gt; I hope we get real mod support.
---
Not without a better way to respec.  Difficult PvE content like that usually takes a variety of builds (in other games) and without the freedom to spec for the situation, its going to be lame.  
---
I've done that too. Had two of them open up on me at the same time with nothing but those screeches. Log off and log back on.
---
Agreed.
---
Take balancing, nerfs, PvP vs PvE, all of that mechanics stuff off the table... at a fundamental level the game is broken and often unplayable due to stability and performance.
---
Three months after release, you cannot have a stable session of game play. 
---
This isn't corner case bugs or arguments about game play and implementation decisions.
---
The game does not achieve it's most basic requirement. Allowing you to log and and play with out interruption due to technical issue.
---
That's really f'n broken. That's Steam trash game broken. That's one developer in a garage broken.
---
It doesn't matter how much fun you have within the mess. Releasing a game in this state is a betrayal to fans and customers never mind it being little improved three months later.
---
Xb1 also and since last patch, I've uninstalled and been playing FO4. I'll eventually come back, just a matter of how long until it's not frustrating 
---
Tigole? That's your example? Oh my god, dude, you are so off base.
---
That link in no way supports what you wrote. You made it seem like he was hired because of his ranting... Tigole led a major guild that had lots of first-hand experience dominating various endgame content. The only mention of his rants is that they made him a celebrity in the EQ community, not that they got him hired. Him and Furor contributed a LOT to the EQ community, they didn't just sit back and whine.
---
So since you seem to think your post is equivalent to Tigole's posts back then, can you explain how you're contributing to the game? Do you lead a major guild? How many world first clears of major content have you done? How many long, detailed posts explaining the problems you've faced have you written?
---
Yea, your post is totally in the same league as Tigole's. A single paragraph whining about something with no specifics or suggestions whatsoever. Mhm. I'm gonna call this one done, have fun with your fantasies. xD
---
I just want to say, of all the things the settlers get functional and restored, those fucking tanks on the side of the road would be pretty handy. That is all.
---
Easy. You dupe, not enough to trigger Bethesda’s algorithms. You get someone who’s pissed at you and reports you. Well now a human checks into your account. Oh look duped items maybe like a stack of 5 tse of the same perked weapons, perhaps a dev room plan sprinkled in there or whatever. From what I have read you only get 2 emails from Bethesda. The first is the one you get when you get banned and the second One is telling you either a) we are going to look into it and either remove items, delete your char or etc, or b) you’re banned indefinitely. I’ve seen a few who were reinstated but didn’t know until they tried to log on sometime after that second email. 
---
No, I corrected that. 
---
I guess I just mean the night-stalker, as it’s directly out of Beowulf: They had too much fun, played their music too loud so the monster came and killed them. Yes, in terms of actual size the cave is bigger but I think the Beowulf reference is more clever and interesting. 
---
Lmao spanked 
---
Mothman being the herald of the Interloper makes a certain amount of sense. I believe Mothman sightings in real life have been tied to various disasters (natural or otherwise).
---
Having those disasters be explained by a Lovecraftian monster would be kind of a cool idea.
---
You got the second and final email. Your not getting unbanned. Either buy another copy and sign up with a new account or stop playing. 
---
I hate that when you first pick up a workshop you could either be defending it against mole rats or multiple Scorchbeasts... Cause those are basically the same thing right? I've gotten into the habit of keeping a close eye on the objective indicator when it's about to turn from 'Prepare you defenses' to 'Defend the Workshop'. You've got about 3 seconds to react, which is just barely enough time to fast travel the hell out of there before it arrives and your fast travel is restricted. At that point, I just let it go. I can't tell you how many times I've given up the Ammo Factory due to this. It's just not worth it. 
---
Yes i do and ive gone through only a handful of cores in a couple hundred hours
---
Scorch Beasts wouldn't be much of a problem if I didn't have to use 300+ rounds on a Lever Action Rifle to have the damn bat run away only to come back a couple minutes later with full health. Its ~~bullshit~~ batshit that I can waste over a dozen hours of farming for ammo on one enemy and it wont die.
---
Since the last patch VATS feels really off. I'm running a VATS heavy pistol build now and I have shots hitting, but not making damage (I can tell because of the critical meter going up or even filling up with Four Leaf Clover), executing criticals not doing anything, or making damage but without Better Critical modifier...
---
In an earleir session today I could have sworn none of my VATS related perks worked for a while.
---
At first, sure - there are atoms that pop up for everything.  You definitely do not get 50 atoms every time you solo a scorchbeast.
---
Whether you realize that you're completing the challenges or not, you are - that's what atoms are coming from if they aren't coming from specific events.  You don't have some special magic account that just generates atoms that no-one else gets.
---
Plop it down near New Gad on the road South of twin lakes workshop. 
---
Alot of traffic there. People farm balistic fiber just up the hill to the west. The workshop is fairly active and alot of level 30s questing  
---
I setup my CAMP in the lake. We use it as a roleplay hub. We give quests and rewards. 
---
Ive gotten about 25 players to do my quest since saturday. Gotta run to the people in the local area and advertise what your doing.
---
It depends on who you want to come visit. If you have a higher level client base, watoga, pleasent valley or whitesprings station might be a better bet.  I find those players arent interested in roleplaying so i stick to the new gad area. so im not bothering people grinding by running up and saying "Our kingdom is in peril! We need a hero! Are you a the hero we need?"
---
Pro tip: For CAMPs that are a shop on a road. Place one wire from your camp on a power line (the ones along the road) . makes it look like your getting your power from the grid. 
---
I’m not sure I  guess it could of but the sound effect sounded like he flew off. 
---
I felt COMPELLED to play this game, so I removed it from my library. 
---
Explosive is still the best modifier for the effects that it actually works with. TS is also still the best general damage increase on a weapon, everything else is either specifically built for or is only better on certain weapon types
---
That's funny, I have a BA in lit as well, and I've never seen one of my peers fail to capitalize English. I've also never seen them try to shit on someone for failing to comply with formal English rules in a reddit post. xD
---
You must have been the champion of your department. Keep it up, champ. You may have studied literary criticism for 5 years but you still don't know what the 'constructive' part of feedback means.
---
This game is hard?
---
Because i have it unlocked.
---
And yet, here we are.
---
I've mentioned this before and the first response was from a console player asking if they were fucked then.   Yep, sorry, #pcmasterrace
---
I like mods.  I haven't played a fallout game without +100 mods installed (not kidding at all).  FO76 is the first one that forces me not to...which is sad.
---
Oh alright what's your psn
---
No I've only gotten one email...
---
Plankman33367
---
Do a google search, community managers have said as much several times.   
---
Another one a while back alluded to the fact allot of the atom store content was already made, hence the consistent release schedule on that side of things 
---
TSE needed a nerf and I'm fine with it but I'm now back in the "avoid scorchbeasts" camp. For a glorious week I was able to kill them without using all of my stimpacks and breaking all of my armor. 4-6 minutes felt right for the loot given. Now it's back to 20 minutes and 40 stimpacks for shitty loot
---
Still waiting.
---
You need something to act as a money sink or inflation will erase the value of everything.
---
I played several games, Anarchy Online, and Star Wars Galaxies that experienced runaway inflation. It was especially bad for swg because new people coming in the game couldn't afford to buy anything in a player run economy.
---
If they ever add a player economy to the game, you need prices to be something that is reasonable. And stay that way
---
I'm a non-PA rifle build. I have a few options right now, mostly a lever-action .45 rifle with double ammo capacity (I can 1 or 2-shot a lot of standard mob spawns with this).
---
I also have a pipe semi-auto rifle (so it's NOT able to double dip with pistol &amp; rifle perks), but it's still doing some pretty decent damage for a .38mm receiver. I set it up to go full auto, so it'll shred most things really quickly, but the problem with this gun is the clips runs out quickly.
---
Lastly, I have a Tesla rifle that I put a charging barrel on, but for some reason I'm not enjoying this as much (even though it says it does the most damage). I seem to kill stuff faster with my lever-action and the .38 pipe rifle.
---
I also have Adrenal Reaction mutation, so in a way all weapons are now bloodied weapons for me. The problem with my SPECIAL my be my Endurance though. I only have 5 points right now, I think I'm at like 282 total HP, which means I need to go down to like 56 HP in order for my Nerd Rage to activate. So I'm thinking I need to boost up my endurance perhaps so I get the Nerd Rage to activate while I'm sitting on more than 57 HP.
---
Factional based PvP with Territorial Control on this map in this world could have been amazing. Nukes would have been crazy pants. The ultimate solution. Fighting for keys, trying to stop launches, getting your factional base nuked. Factional rewards based on workshop control. 
---
Drool... and I don't love PvP.
---
PvP Elder content that grows organically from a rich system of Factional Rewards.
---
We got slaps and wanton meaningless destruction of people camps which essentially destroys the one thing this game arguably does well which is allowing people to express creativity by building cool camps.
---
Still a child
---
I honestly am not sure, I don't have that information yet.
---
You are. Not me.
---
I think you’re missing the point. It was supposed to draw in multiple opinions, that’s why I said I wouldn’t judge. The whole point of this discussion was for me to gather anecdotes from players because that’s what I was interested in. I did this for me, and for people that wanted to talk about this subject. And I started off with the possibility it was just because people were busy during the week with their jobs and responsibilities. So if you’re just gonna try and force an argument congrats I guess but this isn’t the right thread for you man.
---
I wanted to find out how players felt. In their opinion. In their words. That’s valid enough for me to consider it viable because it fits the criteria. I got what I was looking for and I’m happy that a lot of people had feedback. You, however just seem like you came here wanting to argue which is weird because you deliberately came here to say “people are going to whine!!!!” When you’re the only person who’s really whining...idk man just leave me alone you’re weird 
---
I had something similar.  Had my camp set in a little space out in nowheresville.  Three fucking level 80s start spamming their Doughnuts of Doom at my level 20ish ass and my camp.  Completely leveled it, and me.  So I say fuck it, server hop.  New server, five minutes later three level 80 SB come out and decimate me once again.  I try running.  They follow.  Say fuck it again.  Turn off the XBONE in rage.  Pick it up like twenty minutes later, guess who's hanging out at my camp again...  Didn't touch the game for like a week after that.
---
Hats
---
Only because I was financially stable enough to pay for electronic furniture pieces thru the "Fuck it" Clause
---
About 10-155 shoot to kill sb with gaus and in x01 will not get damage.
---
Or just perk armor debuffs
---
Teach me your ways.
---
Me either.
---
And you're still absolutely caught. Must be embarrassing.
---
Let's see the math.
---
How could this have been overlooked? I would love it. 
---
I refuse to, until they put in some decent items! 
---
Sitting on 5k atoms just from casualy playing. 
---
As someone who has soent a few hundred bucks on league of legends, and OW. I am not against paying money for costumes and skins. 
---
However, the shit they put in the atom store is crap. 
---
I want a skin that makes my character look like a glowing ghoul. Will buy atoms for that! 
---
Or a mount of some sort. Or a companion! 
---
Something that feels substantial enough to warrant me paying real money. 
---
A reskinned stash box, or shitty superhero costume is NOT going to get me to spend money. 
---
I need stuff that feels legendary, like LoL skins! 
---
I soent 20 bucks just on DJ Sona, and don't regret it at all. 
---
Make me a glowing ghoul, or a damaged synthetic, and I will buy caps. 
---
Not a day before. 
---
Usually can't go wrong. I love hearing Super Mutants complain. "Ow, my head!"
---
That's because it's critical of you and the other casuals making shit business practices acceptable.
---
I was feeling that way too but it never felt like there's a lot of people in it. I went to scorchqueen event and lots of people were at it.
---
But I doubt if there's as many people playing the game now is there were two months ago
---
 It youre in the subreddit?
---
Lots of AI turrets do once they get into double digit levels.
---
I'd really like to trade cards in for other cards.  I really like the ability to trade cards in for respec points.  Also, trade cards between players.  We REALLY need to be able to use a higher card as if it were a lower level card.  
---
I've suggested before that each perk card have a max value (which is the value of the cards combined to reach that value and a Selected Value (which could be selected at max or any lower value.)  
---
Also, some of the cards just need to flat be converted to character abilities that don't require loading the card first needs to happen:  I shouldn't have to change my cards around manually if I have 3 lock picks or hacker cards.  I should just be able to take on anything up to level 3 once I have those cards.   (Think:  Passive abilities earned by certain perk cards that don't have to be actively selected.)
---
Once a passive ability is earned it can only be improved upon until its max level and that's it.  No more screwing around with swapping it around.   I should always be able to craft max level stuff once I've earned the perk cards for it.    Having to swap nearly meaningless cards around is not a fun part of the game.  
---
Interesting. It does seem nicely balanced, and adaptive. I'm more of a min/maxer, so I don't think I can accept less than fully maxed out rifleman perk cards.
---
I would think that also, especially since that number is almost always 95%... Unless we're all misunderstanding what that number means? (I highly doubt that's the case though) 
---
Maybe they are trying to crowd fund fo5? Probably not but....
---
Agreed. I'm still subscribed to this thread for laughs as the player base struggles in futility.
---
Scorch beasts are literally copy pasted from the dragons of Skyrim 
---
Damn, there's no getting by you. Seems like you know exactly what's going on. Maybe you should be working at Bethesda.
---
I didn't finally kill my first SB until about two weeks ago at level 46.  And that was only because some stranger gifted me a level 45 TSE shotgun just before they nerfed TSE (granted I'm a melee build, so I was royally fucked prior to getting the TSE).
---
I personally know a mod author who was banned for about 2 months, no replies.    
---
And he was known by some community managers.  
---
What I'm trying to say is they are not swift.
---
Alright I hop in in a minute here 
---
I don't. Last time I logged in with my only character I spawned in a nuke zone and was dead before the loading screen finished. Afterwards I thought: Meehhh. Should I get my junk back or wander around my camp or craft anything or what should I do?! Then I logged off and uninstalled the game a few days later. This was a few days before the patch, which unpatched the previous patched bobby pin weight, was released. And I thought: Well, I guess this is a sign.
---
Maybe I will give the game a try when private servers and mods are a thing. Maybe I will give Skyrim multiplayer a chance (is in closed beta already) - which I guess is way better than this...let's call it "grinding with friends"
---
I've seen a number of clever CAMPs in that area that do things like this.  One metal house grafted itself onto a ship, like it was an extension of the ship.  I always stop and ❤ CAMPs like these whenever their owner is home.
---
Lmao you keep believing that and anyone who can do math will know otherwise and know you’re just a moron 😉
---
I have solo’d three, 2 65s and an 80 with a combat assault rifle build just outside harpers ferry.  With the dense mod and adamantium skeleton, I took no damage and made easy work of them all.
---
actually, i know this is entirely against your narrative and you must think i'm a corporate bethesda shill or something.
---
but my first encounter with a scorched beast was near whitesprings. there's like a small arch/'bridge' that provides you with cover against the air, but only so much. i was attacked by not one, but two, scorchbeasts, and all the robots of whitesprings - which, frankly, i had no idea were friendlies at the time - had a war with them.
---
there was explosions everywhere and the sounds of lasers with guns - pew pew, if you will - permeating the air (lovely). cars exploded, shit could not be seen, screen was lit. i thought to myself "as long as i have this camper's delight arch/bridge to hide under, i can do this".
---
so i entered the war, as a third party. i shot at everything, including the robots, and red lasers were flying left and right (and maybe even a blue laser). some robots died. stimpaks were used. ammunition, wasted. more cars exploded, and so did the robats.
---
i was low level. the scorchbeasts would not give up their unrelenting aerial assault, but the robots provided me with moments of truce, letting me heal and check my inventory. the whole shebackle took way longer than it should have, and after 5 minutes, the novelty had faded. still, one of the scorchbeasts had only like 30% hp left, so i endured.
---
game started lagging. bad sign. sounds no longer playing: i knew where this was heading. but surprise! one scorchbeasts dies, one to go. i see the fat xp tag above my exp bar. joy. i run to loot it. crash just before looting. less joy.
---
had a similar story the second time i saw a scorchbeast near whitesprings. when everything exploded, including the explosions, and the robats were on the offensive, you could hear that shit miles away. my friend who was on his way was like "wtf is going on there."
---
i just told him "war... war never changes."
---
&gt;  I'm having fun with the game...
---
How?
---
This was a design decision to encourage grinding since there's not much else to do
---
That is the point though, you are completing the one-time challenges which gives everyone a fair amount but eventually that will end when all the lower tiers are completed.  Events do give Atoms anyways.
---
Not only Fortnite, but Apex Legends just came out and is bringing the big guns. I don't understand what chunk of the market Bethesda hopes to claim even if they DID somehow magically whip good PvP out of their butts.
---
lol dude, that's not even in your original post, which is what I've been criticizing from the start. 
---
You even acknowledge in that post that you are ranting. Not giving constructive criticism, ranting and then trying to justify it to yourself by bringing up the absurdly out of place Tigole example. 
---
Look man, we're getting pretty antagonistic with each other. My objective wasn't to make you feel bad so much as criticize your post for being part of the increased moaning and ranting on this sub recently. And clearly we're now just being adversarial. So I will let it rest. Be well. Enjoy the game, or don't and find a new game to enjoy. Read a book. I'll do the same after I make breakfast.
---
Inspector outfit does it for me.  Other outfits I have gotten from the Atom shop (Western duster, Scarlett Sniper) work as expected. Inspector outfit shows armor stats in menu prior to equipping, but the disappear after equipping.
---
Maybe make the game solo/co-op instead of multiplayer if the numbers are dropping? 
---
I own a house and have my own business that pulls in six figures but nice try.  
---
When you’ve got a actual rebuttal let me know
---
You'd think they'd just pass out and fall to the ground with all that screaming. Do they not need to breath?
---
This is a QoL fix that we need sooner rather than later, especially if it is a simple fix.   One idea:  Just make the preview more accurate so we can see for sure which one is highlighted OR display the armor contents on the inventory screen to the right when the armor is selected.   One of these should be relatively easy to do.  Even if it has to be a popup that lists the armor's contents.  There has got to be a way that doesn't take months to implement.
---
A bit late to reply. But your explanation is clear and made it much more clear how and why you feel about the game. Though I must say I am not bothered by the way how it is now. Your Shotgun ammo example sounds great though. So having that would definitely be a good idea.
---
"Lets add more single player content to online game"- f#cking "genius". I bet the designers of F76 are same idiots.  They build F76 to be service, but fail to understand that single player game as service don't work. This "snowflake" environment is bs to begin with. Lead designers should understand that F76 is online game, those why its audience are player who play online games and player who play online games are used to drama. They want more challenges and more danger, they want more team play, be noobs and get stronger by getting better gear and more experience. 
---
If you look at the Bethesda/Zenimax TX website you'll see they are hiring....  
---
Could be to help with this..   
---
Or to back fill.   
---
But if the issue was just people who didn't know the engine, you'd think they would tap some of the known mod authors, or old hats at Bethesda to assist.
---
There's no point. When I try you just act like you know exactly what's going on an shoot down what myself an many other people have actual proof of.
---
At first. I'm on my second and he's over 50 now. I been doing this since the beta.
---
 Sure they make up challenges that I complete but its a very small part of my happening. Somehow the Atoms pile up quite quickly. Perhaps its my predilection for taking on serious challenges in the world quite happily that allows this steady generation. I got a good pile after my other char Jenny Jones at level 32 took exception to an entire town of high level muties. It took quite a while but they all died. 
---
lol, considering they were programmed by some random guy back in 2010 for Skyrim, your anger toward the current team is... misdirected. xD
---
Sounds like someone had a defend the yard event that spawned three SBs...and they ran towards your camp with them :-)
---
Even if they fix that, the gun will break within one or two tanks-worth of use.
---
It could even be a server event, like the "Powering Up" missions for the power plants. "All Aboard!" maybe. 
---
Delicious.
---
Tell me more.
---
people are pussies, I spent like 40-50 hours in game so at like $1 an hour or maybe a tiny bit more why the fuck are you complaining?   Without friends yes F76 sucks donkey balls but it is not a single player game.       I never said they will stop working im just saying after all their hard work these little pissants crying over bugs would disharten my work ethic too.
---
Have to disagree.   
---
PVP could be great, if the weapons were properly balanced and Legendaries could not be used in PVP
---
"We saw you were choosing perks at every level, so we removed all perks completely from the game." 
---
Sheesh yeah, I feel like the game has had just a complete increase in griefers, especially all the high levels or just following the OP trend of using melee builds. I'm like lvl 201 now, so I've had a good fair share of running into people, and heh from before to now, some clearly have attitude problems. This one guy had like a 15 cap bounty(I only bounty hunt people over lvl 50, and bounties over 5 or 10 depending the lvl) in Cranberrybog and I was like, since I'm in the area, I might aswell just take the bounty of the guy (I don't steal junk from people who have bounties unless they're being d-bags). So Killed the lad, ran to the Watoga station to scrap some armour for mod plans, only to find the same guy following me. So I'm like "So that's your game, huh". Me, not personally enjoying PVP, warped back to my Camp, and fixed my guns, only to open the map and see the guy scaling the savage divide to get all the way to my camp XD. Long story short, he came, broke my generator  and wall(trying to level my house to the ground supposedly), hopped servers. It sorta was a funny experience though hehe
---
Take out one data at a time, leave all the others in your stash.  Put the technical data in a world container (cash register, locker, etc) and then loot it back.  The quest should trigger.  If I recall correctly, you have to server hop each time you do it, or the quest won't trigger. 
---
The only proof I’ve seen anyone provide was a video that only proved that it was server lag and not a dmg bug lol
---
A firing isn’t enough. 
---
Yeah I agree, but within a year the casual player base is going to be playing COD and the die hard fallout fans are already retreating to fo4, New Vegas, etc. might be hard to keep people interested especially since they’ll be playing other titles in the meantime. But who knows. worst case I’m out a couple dollars and some hard drive space. 
---
Two major looter shooters out over the next two months, anthem and the division 2. Private beta for division started recently. Unlikely the player base will increase over this time considering the state of it and the competition
---
This brings a tear to my eye
---
you sound like an incel

Same here. TBH, I rarely craft ammo except for when I don't see enough scorched or supermutants for a while (both seem to carry a fair bit of 308).
---
My mistake then.  Mine is listed as a Bloodied AR +250DR when reloading +50% Limb Damage so I thought it was a secondary.
---
Exactly. You have to grab the fusion core fast before they explode too. 
---
So you're mad at the Skyrim devs then?
---
Can you edit the grammar I’m having trouble understanding your point 
---
When I got my first Key Card, these started showing up on my map as entry points.
---
I gotchoo. The effect listing is so inconsistent anyway
---
It seems a lot of those "I'm quitting for good, pay attention to me" posts were serious. 
---
What do you mean it forces you to not have mods?  I have between 6 and 10 mods loaded.  Sure I have to make sure the ones I load don't "cross the line" into something that would be game breaking, but being able to see things on a dark screen when you have vision problems is ADA territory.  
---
It is on bethesda's known issues list, so hopefully it will be fixed in the next patch.
---
There are guides all over the internet. Google FO76 Guides and FO76 Walkthroughs.
---
Also use the search up top there and tons of posts will pop up.
---
Also, also. Breathe.
---
Against my better judgement...and in my best Seinfeld voice and intonation:
---
"What's the deal with charred ghouls?"
---
But seriously, when I'm mobbing it's one bop on the head with my Instigating Super Sledge (or bloodied mole-miner gauntlet) and they are dead.
---
I find the dearth of faction decorations and apparel surprising too.  How hard would it be to reskin the U.S. Flag asset with a BoS logo?  That's a reskin players might actually buy, not this ugly suit.
---
You're welcome buddy :-)
---
when i finally realized what they were i thought it was pretty sweet
---
That level 2 perk only works with the rains down in Africa.
---
When you already know the route where all the objects appear, you get many 
---
*Implying they rushed it to cash on the Fortnite craze
---
Stop with the Fortnite comparisons. The games are nothing alike at all. 
---
I throw away random excess junk like cloth, and rubber. I also toss ammo I don't use like 40mm, missiles, bolts, fusion cores, etc.
---
Ditto!
---
Well this sub started as a positive and safe heaven from all the hate about f76 game. I unspscribed from fallout sub and come here for this reason.
---
Now it is just full of them salty kids and BS players that  just looking for anything just to bash this game for.
---
Even some of them just straight out lies about bugs that don't exist or just bullshiting just for the karma and getting on the hate train.
---
I mean ffs  if you don't like it just fucking move on  and stop bitching about it. 
---
Even they made a big drama about fucking bobbypins, I am sorry but who ever needs to carry more than 5 bobby pins is fucking stupid.
---
Try r/f76filthycasuals subreddit, at least there is full with ppl who actually play this game and enjoy it.
---
Downvote away, I don't care.
---
You must have a swanky CAMP.
---
This is exactly what happened to me.  I couldn't even quit to the main game menu, I had to force quit the program entirely.
---
Likewise.
---
Like the only affixes for guns that worked (tse). 
---
?? My entire build was group support w/ CHA and INT, friendly fire was going to be a big part of that and I was hoping for a 'free' way to use it since flamer fuel is insanely expensive due to the still unfixed crafting bug. I tried flaming pitchfork, Perfect Storm, Shishk (w/ and w/out extra flamers), superheated sledge and flaming chainsaw and not one of them procced the heal effect, only flamer. This was only a month or so into release though, did they actually fix this and just not note it? Because I kinda gave up on that character after 1 in 3 of the perks I chose just flat didn't work.
---
At least before the nerf you could quickly dispose of them once you reached a certain level and had the guns. Now well it’s a crapfest 
---
Honest tip: Stop playing and come back 6 months later. Maybe Bethesda will have balanced the game by then
---
Head to the ash heap.  The carnival site in the west. I had problems with low output weapons until I went there and got higher level drops.  Gear lvls &gt; 10.
---
Workshop defense quests are good for experience. If you need a little bit extra to get you being able to use a newer weapon.
---
Hope this helps.
---
If it ever becomes worth playing, I’ll come back. But it’s in a sad state right now. 
---
I would have taken 76, but my map was completely blank.
---
I would prefer if you could turn in 3 unwanted perk cards for a random "animated" one back.  Just to give the duplicates and unwanted ones a purpose.
---
One of the more humorous things the devs did in this game is that almost EVERY single toy that isn't a stuffed animal contains lead. Even the baby's rattle contains lead! Pencils are weightless lead, by the way. In real life they're made from graphite, have been since the early 70s, maybe longer?
---
If you need violet flux it's easier to get it on FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar.  No farming necessary.  Just sell stuff you have excess of and don't want any more :)
---
Got extra flux, sell it.  Got extra ammo of one type, sell it.  Got extra mats, sell it :)
---
He actually has a point there.   
---
I've been playing and BETA'ing MMO's since "Ultima-Online" and since the beginning Game studios would admit they don't fully grasp all of the in game interactions and "Tap" OP Players/Guilds to help do Dev and QA work, submit balance suggestions, etc.  
---
It's a well know (but little know, yes yes I know this contradicts itself ) fact inside the "hard core" communities.  
---
"If" Bethesda is doing that already, they've reached out to some of the wrong people, or are not listening to the feedback.  
---
That said, idk if they are interested at this point, some of the MODAuthor community (drum I keep beating) have been submitting fixes for months,'literally since the beta, and we've seen little traction.  
---
Check my post history for more details, I'm one of the die hard, but maybe foolish, people still trying to help by giving them exactly what's wrong and in many cases exactly what's needed to fix it. 
---
Cant blaim you, we are all masochists in here. Kinda like Reek in game of thrones.
---
Tried that several times, because I'd had something similar happen once before.  Nothing.  Totally blank map.
---
And, by the way, "Rape" is not anywhere near what happens to people in video games.
---
I could imagine the A team at the Maryland studio is tied up on another project and cannot really dive in to help. 
---
Use them, you’re not going to get banned. They can’t prove wether you or anyone bought them for real money or even knew if they were duped. 
---
Welcome and enjoy now. :)
---
Lots of us banned 😣 unban us now 
---
yes, I have been for the last few days.  I cant place it anywhere. I keep trying different areas. and income back there is no structure.  Has anyone found a solution to this?
---
Something I think about in regards to the Atom Shop is the limited time buy items.  Like they other day there was a golden revolver that looked pretty spiffy, but the time said available for one day.  If I used a revolver, I probably would have bought that.  But I can't help but think of 'what items have I missed out on because I didn't play for the last two days?' and 'will this limited time item ever come back again?'
---
Same problem here :(
---
Yes. Though there are advantages to aiming at the legs of melee enemies even if it isn't the best target.
---
Interestingly. The shrine to mothman in the museum and by the waterfront outside do not show signs of corruption...yet.
---
Yup I agree! But if you stack up on rifle perks and hide in a good spot, then u can do multiple sneak attacks on a sb with a sniper or lever action rifle! Mine does 170 but the sneak attack does 2x damage so it's actually extremely effective, especially if it's a legendary. And then when they land use a powerful melee weapon to take them out! The real bitch is the scorchbeast queen.... I was doing scorched Earth on a server with a bunch of level 79+ players and we couldn't even kill her! Once she reaches half health she regenerates her health completely but shes not even a legendary! Her skin would literally have to be made of diamond or something to be so good damn strong.
---
Yeah but Fallout 76 came out. 
---
I agree that it's good practice in general and there should have been more of it.  But at the same time, things can really grind to a standstill if you simply don't understand what you're meant to be looking for.  And it is a Bethesda game.  For all anyone knows, *it might not be there at all*.
---
The gun's level doesn't matter. You can scrap any level gun for the same chance of unlocking a mod.
---
If you've ever watched the show breaking bad, you'd know that acids do not react with plastic.  So if you need to melt a body, do it in a plastic tub, not in the bath.

instanced - long - dynamic dungeons with good loot, or PVP dungeons would be huge.
---
Sometimes what one person seems as a "whiny" post another sees as constructive, if impassioned, feedback.   
---
I mean FFS my bug round up consistently start getting nothing but downvotes and I've had people say I'm being too critical.
---
They didn't rip you off! You knew exactly what you were getting when buying this game.
---
At the risk of being baited, exploring locations, leveling casually, building camps, unlocking crafting things (for gear and building), and last night I spent a few hours mainly just roaming the world looking for new camp sites and sharing them on subs.
---
Are you on XBOX?  I have a 2* Bloodied Gatling Gun +10%DMG when aimed.  Can even craft prime reciever if you have the mats.  
---
There have been strong Lovcraftian overtones in both of the Bethesda-made Fallouts (3 and 4), but this is the first time we've actually seen something. The Interloper is... interesting, to be sure. 
---
I dont use them because they arent that great. I didn't like when they where over powered and now they just like my other weapons better 
---
SB are a joke w Fireproof, turn your sound down and face tank the sonic scream. HP bar doesnt move.
---
The treasure is all the abraxo cleaner, plastic, typewriters, and phones I pickup there.  Bubbles is a perk.
---
Yeah, there are some mods out, but you no longer can really modify the game in any fashion remotely close to what was available before.  In a big way, this is a step backwards because so much of what was available is gone.  It makes FO76 a lesser game than previous games, and that's a really hard thing to sell.  Unfortunately, FO76 isn't different enough to fit it into a unique place outside of previous games.  It's too similar and then heavily restricted.  The "not" is a relative scale in the sense that you lose all ability to really change and shape the game.  You get to do only light changes, graphics mods for example.
---
Sure I can help. Psn name: R-C-MAN
---
No, you are just trying to force your opinion on others. I haven't completed main quest in 200 hours.
---
Oh my gosh, thank you! I think I was using the saw cleaver, and I was definitely primarily dodging backwards (got to work on dodging left/right and being aware of my surroundings). Definitely going to try the axe, and get that darn music box. 
---
Also, are there any enemies/locations with a guaranteed/high chance to drop blood vials?
---
Thanks again for the help!
---
OH LAWRD I got something to look forward to! 
---
Hot fix on the way for sure 
---
15 lever actions to get the long scope, sick of screws.  The screws, so many screws.
---
Maybe they're all shitty philips-head screws that cam out easily.
---
I hope next time Bethesda just skips the game and lets us download a microtransaction shop by itself. That way it doesn't have to be 50gb.
---
It's "broken" but for some, less and less, it is "Playable".  
---
I think they didn't do enough to QA, they didn't get the right people involved in the BETA process, and they didn't have a good, clean way to submit bug reports.  
---
I do think the whole thing is savable, but I think they need some fresh eyes to break the echo-chamber they likely have going. 
---
It wouldn't surprise me if this was part of that though.  I mean, you ever play on a team with someone else and notice how they often skip around?  The 95% is probably what your VATS saw at the time, but the server thinks it is somewhere else.
---
Absolute legend thanks
---
(I was low-key expecting you to take it and log off thanks so much)
---
You can only do 2 per server, and they can be finicky, some times taking one out of your stash triggers it, if not, you can try placing it in a world container, then looting it again, when that doesn't work, try dropping it then retrieving it again, when all of these fail, server hop, and try again.
---
Sometimes a server hop is all that's needed to trigger it.
---
Best bet would be to make the Scrapper perk work more like Fallout 4. With the perk enabled you'd get the usual materials PLUS some rarer things like screws, copper, springs, etc. Right now it just gives MORE wood and metal, which are already commonplace in the world. Sometimes I just drop the bulk of my wood and metal scrap. I never even considered adding the Scrapper perk once I learned how it worked in this game.
---
I have all the 10 mm pistol unlocks. What's your psn?
---
The first sentence is actually true though. Melee is quite overpowered.
---
 They make up challenges that I have completed many times on a steady basis. 
---
 Since I bought a floor standing lamp a few days ago I have added nearly 400m Atoms just doing what I do. 
---
 What I do is fire up my char at his place, deep in the Mire, and walk to The Whitespring having minor adventures along the way. He will try to get a Jet Pack for the X0-1 in his pocket. He will make deals and add a few caps to his stash and then walk home. ;)
---
Right, because fire and sonic attacks are basically the same thing!
---
I almost always go to Flatwoods for the vendor, and to drop off all my unwanted plans and low-level legendaries.  
---
Also, that area has reliable fodder for many common daily/weekly challenges.  
---
- Kill ghouls with a meat hook?  I know there are some low-level ghouls in the south end of Flatwoods and in the agricultural center.   
---
- Kill robots with a protest sign?  All those low-level Mr Farmhands will do the trick.  
---
-  Pick bloodleaf and snaptails?  ...you guessed it, the riverbed behind Flatwoods.
---
-  Finish an event while wearing only a hat?  Fertile Soil is my jam.
---
I think they gave up on trying to improve the game a few weeks in and simply want to bleed what they have as long as they can from this before the entire playerbase bails, including increasing grinding.
---
It is the only logical answer I can come up with.
---
Uhh...
---
Okay?
---
I was outside harpers ferry and found someone’s camp.  It was killing the huge monsters that I could barely fight.  After they all died I checked out the place.
---
Saw several fences smashed and went ahead and fixed them up.  Since I have my own food growing at my place I left the crops alone.  Figured it was the neighborly thing to do.
---
I'm playing Mass Effect for the first time.... 
---
There isn't much for me to do in FO76 since I've killed the SBQ a few times. I'm waiting for more content.
---
Console: Xbox one    Gamertag: JAKEDPOTATOES
---
My issue is that I have either been disconnected from the server, had to quit the game and reload it because the game froze, or just had to restart the game because it unexpectedly crashed on me. This has happened far too often. When I first got the game, maybe in November or December, this happened a ton.  The game would just randomly crash as I was playing. The most I counted was 5 times in a 3 hour period. As annoying as that was, it just slightly annoyed me to have to restart the game, log back into my account, find a server, wait for the server to load, and then if I was in a team, I would have to rejoin the team’s server. 
---
Now, as I’m lvl 80+ this problem has started to reoccur. But it’s even more frustrating now because it will happen after I kill a legendary or boss creature, but before I can loot the body. That’s mildly irritating compared to having the game crash as you are respawning. Now, all my junk which I’ve just spent the last countless amount of hours or days searching for, collecting, scrapping or even buying is now gone. 
---
Seeing as how all my weapons and armor is lvl 50, it takes a good amount of items to repair weapons and armor. Even with the right perks on for what I’m trying to fix, or craft, or modify, I always either have just barely enough materials or need one or two more springs or something. 
---
Yeah, I know, I can put stuff in my stash so it won’t get lost or stolen. That’s great but I’m fully stocked in my stash box, and have been since I was lvl 50. I don’t care about being over-encumbered, I’ll walk through the game slowly, that’s not a problem. If I don’t have any more space to fit stuff in my stash because I have different types of power armor, armor, and weapons, as well as ammo, what do I do with all the stuff I might need if my gun breaks or my power armor breaks and I’m not near my camp? I need to fix it on the go, but I need all the materials so I have to carry them, because I’m not going to spend 40 caps to move my camp every time I need to fix my power armor.
---
I’ve lost countless amounts of springs and screws and black titanium and ultracite scraps because of my game crashing while in the middle of respawning. I want to know what Bethesda is going to do about this issue. This game is not living up to the expectations and reputation of a Bethesda game. I understand this was the first attempt at making a Fallout that was multiplayer and allowed you to play the game with your friends, but this wasn’t what I expected at all. And I’m not alone either. People I have been playing with have had the same problem, as well as many other people on the FO76 subreddit. 
---
Hopefully this will get a response, because I’ve been playing the Fallout games for a long time. I remember the first time I played through Fallout 3 and watched Dad give up his life in the water purification chamber. I remember playing New Vegas and Fallout 4 several times through and choosing a different faction to align with, or choosing if I wanted to be a hero or a villain. I even bought an Xbox One just so I could play Fallout 4, since it wasn’t going to be offered on the 360. It’s safe to say that for the longest time it has been my favorite game franchise, but this game and the many blatant flaws and bugs that cause the game to ruin my gameplay experience have started to make me rethink my opinion.
---
I really hope Bethesda figures out a way to fix the many issues that are riddled throughout the game, because at this point, I’m not sure I will buy their next game.
---
Does that help with armor damage as well?
---
So, you got a refund for not understanding how the Atom shop skins work?
---
Good for you, I guess. Maybe I should complain because my hunting rifle skin doesn't work on the combat rifle.
---
I can't argue against most of your points. I just still feel like it's not completely hopeless. Yet.
---
Basicly 
---
Sometimes you don't get to choose, two of them will spawn on top of you and they'll glitch so that they're infinitely firing their ranged attack. 
---
So black titanium and ultracite scrap not too valuable? How about any type of ore?
---
Also 6+ plastic from laser weapons. A godsend if you use shotguns and need a trillion plastic for shells.
---
Thing is, it's ok for not every game in a series to be made for every fan of the series. I've been a fan of final fantasy since the first one on nes. Doesn't mean I've liked, or even played every one, especially the spin offs. As it happened I like MMOs, but if I didn't, I would have recognized 11 and 14 weren't for me, and skipped them. Same here. If you don't have a significant other or buddies to pay with, or just don't like online games in general, that doesn't makes 76 being online a bad decision, or make it a bad game, just a game that isn't *for you.*

---
Fireproof was changed awhile ago to reduce explosive and fire damage by a % instead of giving a flat number to fire resist (which was essentially useless)
---
Regarding parrying, are there any enemies that are good to practice parrying on (or good tricks/cues for timing)? 
---
You could be correct, but if that was the case why are they not reaching out to know "3rd party's" to help?  
---
Let me be clear I'm not trying to be self promoting, but I've been giving them exact fixes that have yet to be implemented for quite a while.   
---
If nothing else why not tap someone like me, get some NDA's signed and let that person fix the "low hanging fruit" while they try to resolve some of the larger stability issues?
---
No doubt.
---
Fortnite skill is what makes you good at PvP.
---
Fallout 76 is pay 2 win.
---
Yea I can’t believe they haven’t integrated a “join previous server” option yet.
---
I have heard people say they can 3 shot a SB in the wings to get it to land but I can't figure out what cards to use to pull off crit shots to do it with just a handmade rifle, anyone know how to ground these fuckers? 
---
I'm taking a break for this reason too.  
---
When I lost a workshop because the carry-weight glitch wouldn't let me fast-travel, I realized that I just wasn't having that much fun any more.  I'll hopefully be back after a few patches; I'm still invested in some of the quest lines.
---
Screws! Depending on which PA I have Ultracite or Black Titanium. I used to throw away heavy metals, but now that I'm crafting more ammo for myself lead and steel are actually constantly being used up, so I don't find myself tossing that anymore.
---
Honestly it will be different for each character. Play them enough to see what you use the most, and what is useless (bone). Make your own rationing schedule from there.
---
Atom shop is crap.
---
While the games may be nothing alike the reality is that money-wise, Fortnite is the biggest game. Period. So every development company is forced to compete with it similar or not.
---
Silly wanderer. You don't fight scorchbeasts, they fight **you**.
---
Sir, I love you constructing the perfect onomatopoeia for the fuck head ass sound Scorchbeasts make! 
---
I'm talking about what the thread is, regardless of your intentions. And you might be happy to just get people's perspectives, if that was your goal, but again-- based on the responses I see and the content of your original post-- what it's bringing in is not diverse points of view but an echo-chamber of negativity. Look at the top replies, I don't see a single positive or optimistic response. 
---
What you intended is what you intended and not really my business. But in the end if you expected anything remotely positive to come out of the wording of your title, or your original post, you are being super tone-deaf to this forum lately and to the broad hate this game gets. 
---
If you're fine with the thread being little more than negativity, so be it. I stand by my points but I'll stop making more because they don't seem to be connecting and I am now super hungry for breakfast. ;)
---
Ive only ever ran into the "Stalking Mothman" 
---
Scares the crap outta me everytime
---
You can use a chemistry station with acid to break it down. I have think until you decide make another mule 
---
Agree. They are impossible at lower levels yet continue to torment you regardless. I’m wasting precious minutes hiding or avoiding or valiantly/stupidly trying to fight. Fuck Scorchbeasts. Oh and the Mirelurl Queen. Fuck her too. 
---
Dense torso mod and/or flameproof perk trivializes them. Why? Their ranged attack is explosive damage.
---
To hell with everyone giving you shit.  I haven’t done the final mission yet for all the reasons you’ve cited.
---
Two characters, one’s a level 78 stealth melee expert, the other’s a level 68 stealth sniper (I like stealth).  Fought and defeated several SBQ’s with other players and have done dozens of WS runs.  No desire at all to launch my own nuke.
---
After the basic training mission I became disgusted with this game.  That obstacle course was utter bullshit.  Can’t even be bothered at this point.  
---
I’ll wait until they allow private servers, then I’ll launch a nuke.  Until then the risk of disconnect is too damn high and the character micro-Managment is too much BS to give a damn.  
---
lololololol. Whas is your toon level? What part of the map are you in? What is 'your build' at this point? Need more info.
---
If you are proceeding at the right pace, and tweak your build, the game is actually pretty easy. (Not to mention, there is basically no death penalty, so who cares if we die!)
---
Ah ok, I thought you had difficulty finding steel in surplus. It’s the only thing I run out of continually for ammo.
---
It really could be great. Another poster mentioned something similar to the depth of Eso's pvp and that would be amazing. I was really just questioning if the effort required to make it great would be worth it for them considering how the rest of the pvp market looks.
---
Ha. While sitting, my camo doesn't turn on, but if I pop a squat on a chair instead, I can stay there in invisible comfort.

A friend and I tested, he was able to see the effect on his Pip-Boy when I hit him with the Shish kebab
---
If Bethesda needs inspiration, they can look at this sub. It's post after post of "here's a neat idea, what if.." and usually the ideas are good and reasonable to implement. I don't think Bethesda gives a fuck though, about your ideas or stripping back the tedious nature of everything in the game now. Sucks but it is what it is.
---
You experienced a single bug where car explosion makes you wanted even in pacifist mode and your immediate conclusion is that PvP needs to be removed from the game.
---
This sub is such a bunch of crybabies.
---
Agree, they should make PVP servers, and if they do allow Legendaries at all, it should either be very very tightly controlled and QA'ed (Assassin's + Sentinel and TS(E)'s should have never **never** gotten past internal testing.  
---
Things that do 10%, or reduce weight I think are fine, but some thing that effects damage by 50%, let alone 200% should not exist on PVP servers 
---
Nah, they said it worked. It doesn't :(
---
More like you were performing witchcraft. You aren't even touching that chair!
---
Nah I go to Blackwater Mine and kill every mole miner and pick up every thing that isn't nailed down all the way through the mine and then I scrap everything and have some of each material and just fix all my stuff right there at the mine then leave the extra for others
---
Pester power. 
---
I consider myself a member of r/fo76FilthyCasuals and am at lvl 35 even though I pre-ordered the game.  I have never looked at the daily or weekly challanges thing (I don't even know where it is) but I have 3900 atoms just from game play.  500 from the code that came with my game then 3400 from doing stuff.  I have yet to spend any since I figure I might want something when I'm much further along in the game.  I am curous of who has bought them...even more so I'd have a couple "Yes" answers with amount like "Yes (Less then $20)", "Yes ($20 - $40 Worth)", and "Yes (More then $40)".
---
Also why is there almost 200 votes yet barely any upvotes?  If you vote you should upvote the topic so others can see it better and also vote.
---
It is a good game. It is not for everyone, no game is for everyone; but it is hood enough to enjoy and well worth the money. The fact that I am potentially playing the worst version of what the game will be then I am happy.
---
I mean look at who the competition is... Black ops 3, Fortnite, and Red dead 2, and that is only 3 of the bigger ones with dozens of other soild entries out there...
---
&gt; do you guys think Bethesda should try to add more single player content
---
No, they should fix the fucking glitches that make the game hard to play.
---
Sorry not online right now. But I will help you

Someone I know who has the guide book told me that it says there's a glowing Mothman. I haven't seen any footage of that. I bet it's a formidable foe! 
---
It was obvious to me you could only put it on the .44 Revolver and not the Western Revolver or the Single Shot Revolver. They said .44 Revolver, showed the gun painted as such, and didn't mention the other weapons which are not the .44 revolver. Just because all those guns shoot .44 does not make them that gun. My hunting rifle shoots .308 or .50 does that mean my hunting rifle skin should go on other weapons that shoot .308 or .50? No. They explained it to you AND gave you your atoms back AND let you keep the paint. No wrong doing here. Sorry you mis read something I guess. 
---
So many times I've been wondering just to hear that that Screech and I had to stop and bunker down in like a hovel or like a home. Anything with where I can hide and just try and wait it out. I'm just in my lvl40s and still do this. Or just sign out now.
---
Sorry the CM's keep saying there passing bugs onto the dev team then you see them saying the same thing in a post about the same bug a month later.
---
CM's say what Bethesda pay the to say, doesn't mean its the truth : /
---
So Curtis, How did you get that Enclave tag next to ur name
---
I really should look into getting a rank or two in Flameproof, since I'm having no luck finding Dense anything.
---
Well typically posts that generalize, bring up no positive points, and make no real attempt to improve the thing in specific ways are 'whiny'. ;)  But I do appreciate perspective's role in how we interpret these things.
---
That said, a 'bug round-up' sounds to me like you're bringing a detailed list of bugs to the attention of devs. That doesn't sound like whining at all. If you made a post that was just you writing "Hey Bethesda look at all these bugs, you are ruining the game!" then I would say you were whining. :P
---
I guess what I could say with all these other sharks in the water IF they want to put in the effort they had better not half ass it like the rest of this game.
---
Pretty much this, yeah. I really don't have any major complaints or issues with the game (besides still being annoyed by how XP for kills isn't shared between Team members), but I've mostly stopped playing for the moment. Not because i have anything against it - I *want* to keep playing - but I was starting to get a little tired of it, and needed a change of pace for a bit. And since the Resident Evil 2 Remake just came out, and I'd never actually played the original...I'm over there playing that for now! But I'm sure I will come back to Fallout at some point!
---
Wait Flame proof w
---
Has a use?
---
I had 4 spawn near the golf course.
---
Click on your name in this comment chain and then press change flair 
---
That’s a terrible excuse.  There’s only so much to explore and traveling faster will help us explore more...I see.  This game is such a fail.  
---
That space game? That might be what they are hiring for as well.
---
messaged u both
---
Admittedly, I bought some atoms for the times the Blackbird and Hotter Rod paints were available
---
I dunno why people like to pretend these never existed and they never had cool stuff in the Atom shop. Better thing to say would be "Never have any good *permanent* things in the Atom Shop until recently" since that's more truthful
---
I've run scrapper and 15+ int for probably at least 100 hours and I have never seen anything but base materials like steel, leather, cloth, rubber, when scrapping.
---
These events are more common than what gets reported.  I believe that the higher level who did something similar for me early on encourages me to help others.
---
I feel these acts of kindness helped create the mostly friendly community we have.
---
In a way we are all neighbors, and neighbors helping neighbors to survive.  For me that’s what the heart of America is about, coming together in great tragedy to help each other get through it.
---
Looks like we rebuilt the Heart of America in the game, now we want the tools to rebuild the infrastructures and buildings.
---
They are probably using full assassins + sentinel armor. So they take less damage in pvp and take even less damage standing still. With enough pieces it makes them take very little damage in pvp.
---
*Shrug*. 
---
Theoretically some of the changes would be very very simple.  
---
Legendaries?  
---
Leave the "quest rewards" as is, but remove anything that effects weapons or damage reduction by more than 10%.  
---
Cutting or modifying allot of that would quite literally only take a day.  
---
Mutations?  
---
Increase the penalties a great deal, Max the total number of mutations to 3 or 4, the first part is cake, the second would likely need some fun condition checks, so could take a couple days.  
---
Suddenly you've got a mostly balance BETA environment for PVP.  
---
I guess what I'm trying to say is the PVP side doesn't need to be impossibly hard to set up as balanced, but it would likely need (2) ESM's, and you'd have to choose during logon 
---
I bless the rains down in Africa
---
Cos people complained it was too easy...
---
 Did 3 level 80s at The Whitespring 2 days a go. I was having so much fun people were laughing at my mad yelling: "Now this is fucking cake". ;)
---
As one of the more interesting and strange aspects of post-war WV, Bethesda would be wise to dive into this cult for some very creepy future content.
---
Could you imagine how excellent some cultist power armor would look, or even just a cosmetic skin?  I'm imagining ivy growing on it, wooden pieces attached with vines, corroded cloth and antlers mounted on the helmet.
---
Yeah I like it too, I saw another idea where an old self push cart would be used. And would be motorized by a robot.
---
It's not deleted, you can server hop and it will be back if the spot is open.  Did you lose items while moving?  I have heard that happen to some before but I haven't experienced it yet.
---
Had 3 where you drop off "Techncial" data for the BOS last night.  2 Level 80s and 50 (I'm level 81).  Someone else, a lower level, was hiding out in the buildings with no PA.  I just walked away in my PA.  One followed me and I took down about 1/3 of its health and flew away and didn't follow any more.
---
I get disconnected seemingly at least every 2 hours, sometimes less, but I don't know if the server has crashed or I am merely being disconnected.
---
They certainly could have a phoenix from the ashes moment like FFXIV but I have yet to see the level of contrition or acceptance from Bethesda that would indicate they have made the first step on the road to redemption.
---
Yes it is empty, because I uninstalled the game. The franchise had a lot of potential. The name of the game had a lot potential. Even the concept had a lot of potential. But I guess delivering a Skyrim with guns with a multiplayer which is way more bad than the [multiplayer mod for Skyrim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSSADfZ01eU) (which is in beta) says everything about the potential of the game.
---
I think they should bring this game to a solid state at first and do some serious bug fixing and balancing. 
---
Why nerfing the TSE so that no one uses it anymore? Because balancing other weapons to dish out the same amount of damage or to feel special so more people use those guns is very difficult. Nerfing the best things till no one uses them is the easiest way. But also the fun is lost. Imagine you farmed for dozends of hours to get that TSE and a patch later it is nerfed. Guess what: That shitty laser beam rifle in your stash is as useless as before. If they would have adjusted other weapons to feel special (and also adjust enemies health, etc.), your TSE would not loose its fanciness. But you might also wanna try that laser weapon. People farming hard for their TSE are not disappointed, but also TSE would not be the only good weapon in the game.
---
But hey...you can now buy fancy skins in the atomic shop, which will give you a bonus to your stats. This effect stacks in team with different outfits...I thought this game was not pay2win?!. But why do they give ingame boni to things bought in the atomic shop instead of fixing the game?!? And now tell me that giving a bonus to stats like health does not matter when playing/winning an online PVP-only game.
---
I bet they're cooking up this story for a long time. I really hope they explore more of the lovcraftian horrors with 76! 
---
I dont even understand why legendary weapons and armor even exist in f4 let alone 76. It's a world based on scifi, every thing that's cool should come from modding the weapon with higher int/perks etc. Want explosive rifle? Craft explosive bullets. Want a 2 shot rifle? Craft a second barrel.
---
The world is primed for player created content of this magnitude and they introduce magic legendary mods based on random loot drops. Ugh. That makes sense for Elder Scrolls but completely missed the mark in Fallout.
---
Exactly the only thing holding RuneScape back is it’s engine I believe they have to build from the ground up if they really want to make RuneScape a juggernaut on a new engine 
---
I burned through 250 screws for 25 lever actions, and got... 4 mods...
---
Likely because there are lots of downvotes as well, even mentioning the atom store is a touchy subject.
---
Honestly, I didn't want to put dollar amounts because I thought it would breed toxicity in the thread. My theory is that the system of earning currency in-game with a shitty dollar conversion rate results in low sales for the shop *and* low customer satisfaction. Seems pretty on point so far.
---
I do wish I had put a "over 100 dollars" option so we could see if we have any whales hiding around here.
---
Bless the rains down in Africa all you want; Too bad the rains don't care one way or the other.  ;p---
---
Why can't it be other Vault (76?) Dwellers who've concentrated more on rebuilding than farming Whitesprings? ;) 
---
Weren't we all tossed in Vault 76 with the intent that we'd be the ones rebuilding?
---
i never have a problem with them i hardly take damage for some reason
---
Ok, let me clarify myself a bit.   
---
'76's PVP could be great, especially for what it is, in its genre.  
---
Comparing X to Y, direct comparison, is a little tough, in my opinion, because of the feature / world content vs X.  
---
I mean some of the bigger PVP games don't really have in game content / stories for example, the whole point is PVP 
---
I follow your train of thought. Thanks for taking the time to elaborate.
---
I'm only level 40. I've stopped doing quests as of the last patch. I have to go through high level areas and just end up dumping a ton of ammo. I've not quite gotten to balancing my character to be more melee. So at this point I just kind of find new players, drop extra plans, chems, food and water. I will loot some scorched to drop weapons for newer players as well. I offer to just follow and provide protection/assistance as they do the early missions. 
---
The game is huge. I figure I can wait on pursuing end game activities until Bethesda possibly fixes ranged builds more. So intil then, Appalachia security services it is. ☺👍
---
I talked to someone earlier who uses a full set of sentinel armor. According to him the effect still works if you are jumping straight up and down and you can't stagger him while he is jumping.
---
LOL.......so basically this guy jumps up and down while shooting you and you can't damage him. Sounds like Fortnite without the fort building mechanics.....oh and of course the magical armor that doesn't allow you to take any damage.
---
[fo76map.com](https://fo76map.com) is my go to. I like that you can turn the filters on and off
---
If you replace your camp everything you had built is in storage.  Look there.  There should be a blueprint looking thing.  If you cannot replace building as is, click to move it all to storage.
---
You will not need to rebuild using new materials.
---
It’s not obvious.  Especially if you rarely move your camp.
---
you mean that paying homage to the world's first text-based adventure game is less interesting than the beowulf story? I see it differently.
---
Especially since not only a few building blocks to the game to remember but an entire dungeon
---
Grind =\= content. 
---
If you’re on PS4 and run into any players like this again, add me, I’ll take care of all of them
---
Aaaaaand I'm now ignoring everything you say from now on cause you have absolutely no idea what the fuck you're on about
---
Wow, thanks for the post. I don't think we need to be thanked, but you have an awesome perspective on the situation. Never change Superbob!
---
This is the worst, and entirely inconsistent. Sometimes I can take down a scorchbeast on my own, no problems. Other times, it does just this, constant sonic attacks to the point where I have to run away and hide and hope the attack stops, all after wasting ammo and having my power armor practically destroyed.
---
I was a RuneScaper too and see your point. I never PvPed in the Wild there either but concentrated on Slayer and reached lvl136 and had most capes. I think FO76 could learn a lot from RuneScape. Especially with with the player hub (grand exchange) and events at Christmas, Easter and Halloween. 
---
Melee wasn't in questing, that's a different topic.
---
Do you have the marsupial mutation and also what food buffs do you use?
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/314752/regarding-dupes-and-exploits
---
I've been playing MMOs since DAoC and I can believe that devs don't fully grasp the scope of their games and all of the problems that come from them. But I can argue with complete confidence that merely crabbing at the devs is ~not~ going to improve that situation. xD  They need data and, IMO at least, encouragement to be able to implement effective change. And if a studio chooses to reach out to someone for feedback I can pretty much assure you they will not be reaching out to people who just have broad negative opinions of their games. Tigole and Furor became a big part of vanilla WoW because they clearly understood the intricacies of endgame in EQ, and Blizzard had a big interest in making endgame a serious part of WoW (and they succeeded fantastically since WoW basically popularized endgame as a core part of MMOs).
---
As far as modders offering fixes, it's a messy situation. On one hand I see the value in dev studios working with modders for fixes, absolutely. On the other hand, they're still part of a corporation that I'm sure does not look kindly on the legal implications of cooperating with non-employees to make significant changes to a product. So in the end I don't think it's hard to understand why Bethesda isn't jumping into bed with modders for what would amount to a complicated situation and a lot of people saying "Bethesda is shit, they had to use amateurs to fix their game for them". xD
---
Personal opinion, I think modders will have their time to shine when private servers come out. It's just a question of how long that takes... I really hope that Bethesda will release them sooner rather than later, because my view is that modders will dramatically improve the game in a short time if they're allowed to do so without legal complications.
---
Server stability is great i'm on ps😂 but its just weird that we all get kicked for seemingly no reason.
---
Who knows, I might just fire the game back up, finish grinding the last couple trophies I need. See just what's been done first-hand
---
Have you found the uniform yet? Or atleast any information regarding it
---
Whoever made this game should be 🔥ed.
---
Bethesda was just like fuck it. Give him the paint and atoms back. I don't even Care at this point. 
---
Oh maybe that's what it is..
---
Yep, every 1 strength gives +5 melee damage
---
I appreciate the advice, been loving my level 10 2 shot pipe-rifle, but instead of 2-3 shots it's more than 12. You reminded me their is an event that has legendary wolves over their. Not a bad idea to server hop till I can run it again and get a higher level weapon!
---
Yes! Maybe "something" was calling those people, and they chose to call it "mothman" because of the local folklore.
---
Depends on the game. There are some interesting Japanese games.
---
There are some that left and some that stayed. Some people have an alt because like my original character from beta, you cant unlock some achievements with them, some people are farming for TSE weapons, some people enjoy the C.A.M.P stuff and just interacting with others. and some ppl play with their partners like my wife and I do that adds a new layer to the game when you can do whatever together instead of alone, and some ppl just enjoy finding assholes and trolls for reasons not easily explained. Those who don't enjoy any of that have probably left and are waiting for new content, and some farmers who finally got their desired weapon probably ended up not having much motivation to keep playing.
---
I shall. In the meantime feel free to cast neg assumptions... must get you very far in life being so narrow minded :)
---
While Beth support isn't quite on the level yet, acting like a cunt will not get you far.
---
102 for blue 100 for pink, thats the male female birthrate globally.  
---
but I mean you could go with 100 blue vs 70 pink and make it like most payrolls.  
---
One of my favorite snaps is me crouching on a tractor...totally looks like I'm driving it with my arm resting on the steering wheel. Got to find that one...
---
They are saying the map had zero respawn points, just the skull/crossbones icon which you can’t respawn to. 
---
 LOL. I troll the Fissures. Did the one near The Whitespring yesterday and discovered I had sold too many stim packs. ;) Ho ho killed it anyway, but was a bit more careful than usual.
---
Sadly the same here. We started playing with around 6 people and I am left alone now. People really didn't like the nerf on those cards. The nerf wouldn't be a real problem if the mobs and everything else weren't so tanky, but they are, it's insane and having to repair your weapon constantly doesn't make it better either. I was enjoying this game so much but that 'balance' patch quite ruined it for me. I truly hope they will look into this ;-;
---
Why are you even moving your camp? Swap servers.
---
Someone a while back posted one hitting 100dmg so im sure it does. He claimed it shredded with how fast it ticks. 
---
Spot on dawg. Upvote for the people at Bethesda 
---
Yeah, what you're saying definitely makes sense.
---
I ran into a random last night.  3* legendary gulper by Dyer Chemical.  When I finally put it down, i was able to at least SEE the Two Shot Gatling Plasma in the loot box before it dropped through the ground never to be seen again.  The RNG has been good to me the last couple days, but I was still disappointed to see it disappear.
---
That doesnt explain how to go about getting unbanned at all not helpful in even the slightest considering I've read that before and its total bs
---
Yes! I think it could be a good way to bring some supernatural vibes to Fallout.
---
I have spoken with Bethesda. No bans will occur. This isn't actually a glitch it's a property of the physics engine leftover from Fallout 4. 
---
I am still having fun. Started a new character to try out a short range build and have run into so many helpful people at lower levels. Even dudes at just 20 were welcoming me to the game with stims and snacks. 
---
I've had this problem for an hour or so. Tried repairing game, restarting computer. No fix. 
---
I'm in Europe too. 
---
&gt; I hope we get real mod support. 
---
Maybe we will get a multiplayer mod, which fixes those disconnects and server crashes. So we would be able to enjoy the game.
---
But yes, let's wait 1-2 years and play Skyrim multiplayer instead.
---
This is the best suggestion about this game ever.
---
I purchased some at Christmas using some of the PSN vouchers I received.
---
Pretty sure the generic human type enemies around the area drop them frequently, there's the guy in the chair in a dark room who has a guaranteed bullet drop.
---
I've been playing FO since 1998, own &amp; still play most versions regularly, and I am really disappointed by the ATOM shop crap that does nothing but ruin the Lore of the game.
---
Give us some Lore friendly Skins &amp; Outfits, maybe some from previous titles, FONV had some really good ones.
---
I also want my Anti-Material Rifle back, and I want it to deal some serious damage to the Scorched Bitch Queen, and while we're at it, please make sure it doesn't weigh 48 pounds after we mod it, or break in 6 shots.
---
I tried that once when I was roughly lvl 30, but the damn thing just kept flying away! 
---
I was defending a workshop, and the beastie flew in, broke my turrets, blew some "smoke rings" at me and flew away. And then came back a few moments later to rinse and repeat. 
---
I even tried following it, but it just made a wide circle around the area and I could never keep up. In the end, I just logged off. 
---
You only need them if you want to enjoy the game, so no not technically but they are practically required for every player which means they arent an option and shouldn't be part of a characters build progression. 
---
Lol,  good luck in life kid.
---
That's fine, unarmed actually hits harder anyhow.
---
Found a plasma gun with a flamer attachment mod, uses plasma rounds. Prefer it over any other flamer, but no clue which perks would have an effect on it.
---
Don't say this!! They'll drop the amount of atoms they give out significantly!!!
---
In my observation, no it doesn't. Someone would have to test with 100 guns to confirm if different levels produce different chances at mods but my guess based purely on experience is no, level doesn't matter. I always craft the lowest level gun to try and learn mods and do just fine.
---
 Oh please. They are the best part of the game. 
---
 At first, completely overwhelming. You gotta hide and they will snuff you like a bug.
---
 Now I hunt them. I look for Fissures and get them there. I am killing a lot of them these days and boy does that feel good.
---
 Yo go from helpless, to revenge is very sweet.
---
Yes. I lost a chameleon left leg that actually had very good damage protection stats.  
---
I'm just upset i can't even log in. Everytime i hit play the game crashes. No idea what to do to fix it 
---
Wouldn’t it be the norm to fill servers from the bottom up rather than scattering players across all available, regardless of a declining base?
---
One thing I’ve noticed that may be part of the problem here is that the game will not always correctly notify you if you have actual LoS on a target.
---
I’ve had many situations where I’m in VATS, 95% hit, and nothing lands. I try several times - still nothing. 
---
I back out of VATS and use my scope to fire off a shot, and I see my round *ping* off some object between me and my target; a wall edge, random rock, branch, etc. 
---
I call that “phantom hit box” syndrome.
---
The other, more well-known issue is that the hit% in VATS is incorrect for roughly a second or two when you first engage VATS. If you bring up VATS, and fire as soon as it identifies a target, you will miss almost 100% of the time, even if it claims you’re at 95%.
---
I always give my first shot a two-count before pulling the trigger.
---
Now I'm picturing a Jane Goodall type living amongst the mole miners, trying to teach them sign language
---
I feel like I might be the only person that uses life giver.  This is my unarmed tank build, I use a black powder rifle for range.  
---

Same to you sad act
---
Maybe a tasty radscorpion egg.  It cures all addictions, so I could finally have a real life outside video games.
---
Real answer: a mirelurk cake. Lets you breathe underwater for 1 hour. Challenge David Blaine to a contest, bet $5 million, broadcast globally with lots of huge sponsors, eat cake, profit. 
---
This just makes me yearn for junk structures like we had in Fallout 4. Bring them back please! I want to become one with my garbage.
---
Great findings! Those faces are really unsettling and I’ve been wondering what the deal with them is. Never realized the connections to fallout 4 either. I hope you’re on to something here. When I left lucky hole mine for the first time I remember thinking that I hope there’s more to it and the whole cult in general.
---
Can anyone else confirm the aura emanating from the ritual site? That’s really interesting 
---
That's happened to me before too. Are you Bethesda?? If so put your hand out.  I'm gonna snack it
---
Since you are lvl 14 just go to the west side of the map and kill stuff. If it's lvl 40+ and you don't have grenades, run. 
---
 Good lord. Click on it and it will tell you what it does. A 44 is not a Western Revolver even if they use the same Ammo.
---
 Silly mistake, and boy did you overreact.
---
I dont know...what do they do?
---
Let u in to the launch silo?
---
I was just trying to use my original post as a springboard for positive discourse, which I would say it happily succeeded at. The statement I made about Kaplan was not intended as a comparison to my post. Just a general statement about how criticism, even extremely harsh criticism, can be very healthy for a development cycle. And yeah, there are grammatical mistakes in my Reddit post despite my education. Because it is a Reddit post. Not a dissertation, and I don't give enough of a shit to proofread it because I am already trying to read all the new comments, respond to most of them, and play fallout after not sleeping for 2 days.  
---
I thought the song was funny.
---
or store...
---
The servers are definitely lower in population than they've ever been before. Source: My own observation. I am so bored I spend my in-game time looking around the map for lower level players to see if I can help them. It's getting harder to find any.
---
Son, you shouldn't need this advice more than once, but...
---
....stay off the drugs.
---
I keep meaning to test with the Perfect Storm now and see if it works. That gun would be perfect for a healing role if it worked. Spray heal for the win!
---
How are the neighbors just up the road?
---
blinding tickles
---
No you fucking won't. You're doing nothing useful like those Austin jerks.
---
Yeah, like they have some kind of radar or something. What the hell are they, some kind of giant bat?
---
Aside from the Scorched, the Mole Miners and the roots in The Mire... is there anything in the game that's NOT an asset flip?
---
I had thought the Gulpers and Hermit Crabs, as well as the Lever-Action Rifle and Tesla Rifle was all new... until the game made me miss Fallout 4, and I went back and played the DLC for the first time. Sadly, nope, it's all in there, in Far Harbor.
---
Same, that's what made me post it. Irritating how many levels I had to spend just to have lower level versions of cards.
---
But after that what is there to do, I didn’t mean single player more as single player/co-op I’ll make that edit. But the bugs are annoying but when they’re fixed it’s still over all an unrewarding game after a few months. Which will hopefully change since Bethesda wants this to be a long term game. 
---
I was just stunned by 900 hours. I'm at almost 200 and I thought I played quite a bit. I didn't notice a mutation bug. I think the TSE should have gone down, though obviously the exploding bug shouldn't have happened. I dislike the demo perk going down as it affects base exploding weapons, but what are you going to do. I have speed demon so I think the food and drink is somewhat reasonable at the current levels for that mutation. I only have one character so I'm not sure for normal play. I'm fine with the fusion cores not lasting very long. I mean they last a while if you don't have a jetpack. I'd like for fusion cores in powerarmor to be cost prohibitive in most cases so not everybody runs around with it if it wasn't a Queen fight. Health for enemies and players should be lower, so you'd be more worried about dying. Sneak is bugged and I hope it gets fixed. 
---
I don't really think the number of hours put in matters to Bethesda as much as the amount of money spent on atoms, but they're also not asking for their opinions. 
---
I log in entirely just to look at the atom store prices/what they sneak in. As long as it costs 18  dollars for 3 floor skins. i can assume its a pile of horseshit. Though they upped the game with low quality pay for stat gear. I  guess anyone can argue that it doesn't since its near impossible to find anyone online to play with anymore.
---
Lol nice reply you cunt.
---
Usain Bolt level sprinting at you is part of it IMO
---
[Outage Reports](https://outage.report/fallout-76#2019-02-06)
---
Seems to be server issues in our area. Time for a break, I may go outside or look out the window O\_o
---
Sucks?
---
I try put in container but nothing, i need a friend for this. Because i put and leave the server xD lucky.not?
---
 I don't care much, but I am upset I can't plant Pumpkins. That is a serious disappointment after I found a patch, and carefully took some home to plant. ;(
---
Or, you know, to reuse assets and save $$
---
I feel this post in my soul. Can not agree more. I am a melee build. I am ok with running to spot to spot to keep myself safe from the sonic attack. God save me if we are in tree location.  Scorchbeasts will not come down for nothing. 
---
The ratio of legendary armour drops to legendary weapons is waay too one sided... I’m averaging about 6 pieces of armour dropped to one weapon 🙁
---
I'm not glad you are having the problem, but it is always comforting to know one's not alone :)
---
Someone posted here the other day that their theory is Bethesda realizes there is just no way to make the game profitable so there's no point throwing good resources after it. Let the game die through attrition, let the userbase dry up until there's no one (or very few) left to complain.
---
Some of us who've left the game didn't do so with an intent for it to be permanent. I'm waiting for bug fixes, QOL improvements, and more content. I plan on coming back after I see some significant progress in that direction (and Reddit is probably the best/easiest way to keep up with that).
---
So i put in container world and get again if this nlt worked try in new server?
---
&gt;Assaultron - Legs (their legs are really weak; they'll start crawling towards you)  
---
I had of those those broken leg laser face wankers chasing me around the train station at Watoga, bastard *would not die*, I was running loops through the station and the bastard would double back and be waiting with a face fuck when I think I'm being clever sneaking up behind it.
---
Take a minute and look at how the various locations are designed, look for little easter eggs, read holotape stories, etc.
---
For all of 76's gameplay flaws, the design is top notch. 
---
Pfft that's low level aggro, you can still see the screen most of the time. Imagine the green flashes *constantly for 45 seconds*.
---
Thank you. 
---
I hate these "I quit" threads. It's a *game*, something you play for fun. If you aren't having fun then just... Stop playing. It isn't a job or a lifestyle. Like I'm not out here talking about how I quit playing Shadow Warrior, WoW, Mass Effect, Skyrim, MtG, etc. 
---
Just go do something else you find fun
---
Ah yes - the "call support FN' RETARDS" approach, so glad people like you are out there.
---
Can you please add a way for us to re fabricate the mistress if mystery items? I got rid if my sword and gun thinking I could just re make it later. Not realizing it was just a level upgrade.
---
It's a well known issue and a lot of people are pissed about it. At least you got your atoms back 
---
Given the amount of post where BGS (allegedly) ignores trouble tickets I'd say your lucky you got any replies.
---
Perhaps they should add a disclaimer "will not work with western revolver" to avoid any further discord
---
No, and if the items remain priced the way they are I never will - the value just isn't there.
---
Asking $18 for a power armor skin is insulting.
---
 Long Night Vision plans are not uncommon for the Lever Action. Wallace has em' quite a lot.
---
Happened to me. Died before completely being logged in. Fun. 
---
Are you compelled to uninstall yet?
---
Blame the people who created and programmed Skyrim's dragons.
---
It's kind of a shame because conceptually the Scorched are a new and interesting Fallout enemy. I wish they along with the Molemen had been in Fallout 4.
---
No. I'd pay for an expansion with real money, but not fluff. 
---
Star Citizen is actually tangibly delivering a lot of the stuff they talk about though.
---
Have you just turned the game off and restarted it? 
---
Good idea! I've been playing Slay the Spire and I think I'm going to buy Rimworld today. Any one have some suggestions for games that are more fun and less buggy than 76?
---
I had to take mine down this weekend as they kept shooting me.
---
Same. I actually picked ESO back up and am thoroughly enjoying it post 76.
---
There isnt a point to a single player having multiple characters in fo76. Next Question.
---
However much that I agree they should be strong, they shouldn’t one shot everything like TSE used to. Bloodied melee builds can one shot lvl 80 Schorchbeasts. That is too powerful, they shouldn’t be able to do that.
---
This one *seems* like it would be so simple to fix too. 
---
 I have seen it once. Its on my BOS Heavy Combat Chest. I can put a 40mm into the ground at my feet and suffer no damage whatsoever.
---
I always figured when the game was in development they probably had a large programming/coding staff. They release the game half done and buggy, and sales are so piss poor they end up having to cut costs and lay off staff. 
---
Now you have a game that needs a ridiculous amount of coding done to fix it, with less people to carry out the work. Which is why patches are in the state they are. 
---
Exit the silo. After you launch the nuke a door opens up to a hallway in the last room of the silo where there's a Porta Please elevator that you ride back up to the surface
---
I swear Beth was like, hey remember how everyone loved dragons in Skyrim?(imo the worst part of Skyrim) let's put those in fallout. But since dragons breath fire we need to have something cooler, like sound waves are BLIND YOU AND SHAKE THE FUCKING SCREEN!!!
---
Oh! Also let's make melee the strongest fighting style and make the scorchbeasts fly only. Take that op builds!!
---
Not something i feel is worth real money. I spent my real money on the games. I already bought fo4 and it's dlcs.... why pay for the outfits that i had in fo4??
---
I get that things are pushed out the door asap these days but it's like the money men gave no fucks and gave them fuck all resources for fixing engine bugs (copy/paste half the Nexus, job done) and less than nothing when it certainly to actual testing of the product.  
---
I get that asset flips are meant to be easy money but they need to put in *something*.
---
&gt;loot isn't worth the ammo required to kill them. 
---
Best resin to not even mess with them. I am wasting stimpacks to stay a live on them. When I could be enjoying fighting mutants and other creatures. 
---
I think i got my 1st one within 2 or 3 hours, which i thought was ok. 
---
I’m still looking for a 2nd one and with my luck won’t find it before Bethesda “fix” this and have it always available for 10 times the current price
---
Or maybe they thought if they followed you for a few mins you'd reconsider. Really doesn't seem like there was malice in it. If they followed you for the remainder of your time I'd see it as briefing. But honestly just reading it seems like abit of harmless fun.
---
Reek isn't a masochist. He doesn't enjoy what's happened to him.
---
Unless you're referring to the pre-Theon Reek's, either the first one that did corpses with Ramsay or the Bastard of Bolton himself when he was undercover in Winterfell.
---
I'm going to sound like a diluted fan boy for a second, but I rocked the boat enough this week I got a call from Bethesda's Customer Support Manager "Dan" yesterday that lasted 40 minutes.  
---
They do seems to care, but like many medium sized + companies different dpt. are not always in sync with one another, and it's not as easy as walking to someone's desk and giving them a note.   
---
The Community Managers also don't seem to (generally speaking) have a direct line to the Dev's..   
---
Do I disagree with how some things have been handled and unhappy with the state of the game? 100% yes.  
---
But having had some conversations with them about streamlining the bug report / submission process I think they are invested, just we're not prepared for a launch this rocky.
---
 Yup fire and explosions. I have 3 levels of that.
---
This. I store it away on another character when I have more than 200 springs or screws saved up. Have 100s of both stored if not more. Ballistic fibre I only hold on to 50 and store the rest too.
---
Plastic is my only issue that I have to actually look out for.
---
I agree. It makes no sense why some plants are allowed and others aren't. 
---
Bummer, thought it might be a backdoor to get to the launch room.
---
LOL Yeah, they're bastards. They never stop.
---
That right there is what I think is messing up Bethesda’s approach to the Atom Shop. “We give players Atoms for free so things have to be expensive” but I’ll be damned if I’m going to spend $20 real dollars for an underwhelming Atom Shop item. 
---
And this coming from someone who even bought stuff from the hated Creation Club in FO4 (that Arcade set was too perfect for my Starlight Drive-In warehouse). 
---
Better deals, better items (paints for ALL the PAs, or all weapons, etc), bigger camp budgets, some sort of ability to return to workshops you claimed after being disconnected, and being able to build closer to other players miiiiight get me to open my wallet, but really nothing feels *worth* real money in the shop. 
---
No lead is not my problem, and scrapping lots of weapons for steel is very useful to keep up with my ammo's steel demands.
---
 I love my Pumpkin soup and was hoping for a patch.
---
Just curious but would console versions be able to get these mods? Or would it just be dead on console and thrive on PC?
---
Are you kidding?! It looks like he's riding mutated Dumbo into battle and they're both screaming into the air like a bunch of badasses
---
Yeah I feel like after lvl 50 is where you really start to fine tune your character. I’m lvl 61 and I’ve been figuring out what perks I can live with and ones I can live without. 
---
Nope. I'm always trying to find servers where whitespring might have unrulygolfers, but there's always a group of players there. 
---
Add in the fact some of us are doing thing on our phones with "autocorrects" we miss and "fat finger" errors...  
---
Yes, totally understand.
---
Ive been gone for over a month and this game continues to go in a towards trend. I think people need to boycott the game for say a week or two to show bethesda that not listening to the community will ruin their game. We all know weve got plenty of games to play so why would we sit through updates that gain no ground with the community? Ive definitely stopped playing the game until they show some signs of creating a game that the fans of fallout series want to see
---
X01 and fire proof barely notice them at all, x01 fire proof and grounded don't feel a thing. Well a little bit of nausea because of the constant screen shake and light show.
---
You are. I have plenty of friends who use bloodied weapons and never die at the queen or anywhere else really if they are paying attention. I'm sure you just don't have the build right. I would suggest doing some research before you decide to give us a diatribe.
---
Do you think you took that a little personally? :)
---
Which they don’t even test.  Fancy $7 bed broke my camp (instantly maxed budget and scrapping didn’t remove any).
---
haha, I took one like that in a military jeep somewhere
---
Always look out for first aid kits and medic bags they usually have stimpaks.
---
I play rifle build and have never been PvP killed
---
by melee. 
---
There is zero reason to nerf melee. Zero.
---
We need a patch for this patch. 🎃
---
&gt;I don't really think I will replay the story which I have done with previous fallouts
---
I'm sad to say I do feel the same way, I'm really enjoying the game and especially modifying the build and mutations to test different scenarios, but I just can't see myself starting over with a new character knowing what there is out there once I've finally experienced everything.
---
Perhaps if BGS do release DLC content I may explore that, I'll see.
---
The way you write confuses me, and the voice i read it in is beaky buzzards voice. Lolol
---
Better nerf TSE and increase blast time.
---
It'll make them as useful as the Space suits. 
---
Since I'm not seeing much commentary on your side-bar...
---
YES, they should totally shelve Survival Mode in favor of more single player content. There never seemed to be much demand for Surivival Mode (and there are some pretty poorly thought out (or under-thought-out) parts of Survival Mode that giving it time to simmer would benefit the game significantly. That said, the storyline 1-player content has been thin since launch and is something that most people would benefit from.
---
i was doing the BoS transponder mission.  and had 2 scorchbeasts sonic screeching and like 15 scorched charging me.  Died like 5 times.  I had no junk to drop so i guess I just wasted ammo/meds.  Still.. wtf?!?!  
---
Doorways seem to be the my only advantage against SB's and Deathclaws.. ugh. 
---
IMO non-team members and those without bounties shouldn't appear on the world map.     Appearing on the compass is okay so long as it's tied to perception.    This would allow stalking, but you'd have to spot someone in person before doing so.    You wouldn't be able to figure out where there C.A.M.P. is because their dot isn't moving or go after lowbies because "Hey, there's fresh meat in Grafton."    Sure new players can sneak, block, and server hop.    But it's kinda shooting fish in a barrel.    Especially the ones that have never played before.
---
take the disc out?
---
It’s Bethesda. It don’t work without mods. 
---
Theres a defend workshop event that spawns 3 sbs. The rewards are usually pretty good
---
Yeah, the whole playing with friends was what hooked me on the game, but they've all deleted it to make room for what they feel is a real game by comparison. Biggest reason I've yet to launch it again.
---
It’s not on disc 
---
That, and they’re probably also slashing backend resource budgets faster than players are leaving.  So the thing you need an answer from to see loot, or to load the workshop menu.  Those things take 45 seconds or never work, likely due to the same greed, cheapness, and short-sighted laziness that got them (Zenimax, BGS leadership, TODD) into this mess in the first place
---
See, That's just the thing though. They could make this game insanely profitable. I mean all they would really have to do is adjust their microtransactions a bit. Just produce a high volume of insanely badass stuff that people wouldn't want to live without, and is reasonably priced. 
---
creepy
---
Players felt compelled to complete the main quest, so we removed it. 
---
In your honor, Bethesda will put another item in the store for $ 15. 
---
I noticed the lady figure around 76 during explorations.  I call her the Forge Goddess since she appears around great marvels of mining and science.  Places of rich mining and science corporations and money. She gave me an Athena + Hephaestus feeling.  
---
My personal headcanons are... She's actually a Daedric Prince in Fallout.  And the daedra had a hand in manipulating the war and destruction of the world.  
---
And the Interloper Male is the the series' "Mysterious Stranger," a cult to this appearing and disappearing dude that brings death when danger is near.  Unlikely, but I like entertaining that idea. It's more likely the face of RobCo or one of the tech founders of big corporations, self glorfying the rich. Or he's similar to the lady in that he's a personified type of god, only representing Technology or the Future.  
---
Ever since the nerf both the alcoholic and drug addict build have become the same
---
 I logged on for the first time in about 4 weeks on Sunday.
---
I took over a workbench and started to have fun, re-learning the in game stuff filthy casuals like myself just don't have the memory and energy to remember doing for more than a few days.
---
Defend once, twice against a bunch of scorched dudes... died like 5 or 6 times.  No biggie... had fun killing them.
---
The a 3rd defend event pops up - it say kills the scorchbeast.  Hmm, not sure what that is.  Better for a few more guns for defense.
---
Well, my lvl 30 ass wasn't ready nor equipped to take on this flying monstrosity.  I suck at FPS to begin with, inaccurate at shooting and running around.  Well, I avoided death by just staying inside the entire time and hearing the beast flying around.  Then out of the blue this lvl 92 guy shows up... he looks at me.  I just go on with my business, fixing stuff and claiming what my little resource machines were making.  If he wanted the bench, I wasnt putting up a fight.
---
Well the guy walks outside, I hear some dragon like screams and a bunch of gunfire.  Then it states that the bench is successfully defended and I get some loot\\XP since I seemed to have actually managed at least one hit on the beast at some point.
---
The guy comes back in, wants to trade, I accept.  I waited like 30 seconds and nothing was being offered or he flagged nothing he wanted.  I guess he was waiting for me to ask for stuff.
---
It was nice to finally come across one of the nice ones.  I didn't ask for anything, I don't think I play enough to benefit... I just enjoy immersing myself in the game and living off the scraps that scorched drop and freebies when I complete quests.
---
All that to say, I don't think I will ever be in a position to take on a scorchbeast.  Ever.  I was happy that it attracted a kind high level vault dweller that was able to dispatch it for me so I could continue my junk farming.
---
Ikr I think Todd Howard has hacked my console 
---
Half assed content
---
Where do you get the sack hood?
---
Now Borderlands knows how to do Co-op. Plus couch co-op. 
---
I only use Radaway, radaway diluted and stim packs and keep them capped at 50 since they weigh 1 each in stash. I sell the rest. I cap non valuable mats at 25. I have end game armor and weapons and either give away or sell anything else. I also run no weight reducing perks in my build unless I need to switch to a fast travel mule mode for vendor selling (pc mod perk deck saver). 
---
That's because you keep dropping it to get high
---
I don't necessarily think that melee needs a nerf, but I do think that other weapons might need a buff.
---
Case in point: Strength as a multiplier of melee damage, no other special as a multiplier of any other weapon. This is broken as fuck.
---
Perception should buff rifle damage, agility should buff pistol damage, etc etc.
---
Of course this would necessitate rebalancing of enemies to make them harder (to absorb all that damage and keep some semblance of challenge), and that will never be done.
---
I fundamentally disagree with the "nerf" philosophy, but with the current state of the game, melee has it coming.
---
There were mods to add all food plants to the crafting menu in FO4.
---
Hey, Bethesda, here's a hint -- take a look at Nexus if you're curious about what people want in their game.
---
The original Unreal used to do that on my PC Back in the day
---
Gameplay stopped me from that one. Pistols are bad enough that I couldn’t even rationalize finding a .44 to use even though the paint job was cool enough that I wanted to. 
---
I'm in North East UK, clicked on the 'I'm also affected' button on the outage website. I looked out of my window and it's dark, went outside and it was also dark :(
---
I did make a post like that...

[Bethesda the Mod Author community has been trying to provide fixes to you since the BETA. You are still ignoring us and not using them..](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aljowa/bethesda_the_mod_author_community_has_been_try_to/).

Which was generally received well, but one could say it was "Whiny"... Heck a couple people accused me of being a Karma whore (I had 200 karma before that post, so flawed argument IMHO).

Ironically the follow up post, where I was trying to report back to the community, had a more solid history of downvotes..

I know there's a lot of negativity surrounding F76 but I'm asking a serious question here - I really wonder what content will be added in the near future.
---
You must have used VATS to shoot your own foot, because the accuracy was off the charts. lol 
---
Wait for the Creation Kit to release (lol) and I'll put my limited experience into making a companion called Hans.
---
I love the analogy, but to me the mothman looks terrified of the crazy blue armored man.
---
Recycled objects from fallout 4 in the atomic store 
---
yeah dude. spawned at my house the other day and the mythical grafton monster had a health glitch and was at my house along with 3 scorched beasts. my camp was obliterated. :/ 
---
I'm lvl35 too.  I was able to kill one (lvl 50 sb).  Thanks to a trusty doorway the SB couldn't follow me through.  Used all the ammo.  But it's hard when then follow you even though you're "Hidden".
---
I keep ammo I, or my team, uses. 
---
I keep my favorite clothing and a back up set of armor incase mine is broken and i dont have time to materials to fix what I'm wearing.
---
I keep a handful of backup guns. 
---
I keep 2 bulk of most materials and sell all the rest, except steel, lead, adhesive, screws, and acid. 
---
I keep back up radaway and stimpacks, any decent bobbleheads or magazines, most are crap, and sell all the other chems. 
---
Big if true.
---
I stopped playing for a while until there is more fixes and actual content.  I can only kill the scorch beast queen so many times before I get bored.  Focus has been on other releases to tide me over until additions are added into 76
---
Once put my camp where a scorchbeast spawned, noped out of that server before touch damage was done.  Started again, put me back in the same server where I got brutally raped as the world finish loading. Turned my box off, I was done 
---
If it's dark outside as well I think someone turned off the street lights, you should contact your local council and state your concerns.
---
Out of doors is overrated anyway :)
---
Me too! I've been kicked off a server 3-4 times, ever. I do run into bugged missions occasionally but I just go do something else or server hop and it reloads. I haven't run into it much at at all.  Certainly not daily or even weekly and I play for a few hours almost every day on PS4. Believe me, I count myself lucky!!
---
I've been that soldier.

---
25 tips huh?  That’s pretty slim no?
---
Understandable.  I was just poking fun with my comment.  No offense intended. 
---
I think your entire country got the ban hammer
---
The ones we can build don't seem to.  That's grossly unfair.
---
Right?  I want people to use my stuff.  If you need water, take it.  Use the beds.  Play the piano in the guest bedroom.  The only rule is shut the damn door.  You're letting out the bought air.
---
graphics are so much better, too.
---
I just miss stealth being useful - and manually scrapping things sucks.
---
Really don't think they had to lay off anyone. I mean, I just read in another post that they sold 1.5 million copies. And a developer that size doesn't depend on the profits from a single game. I mean they probably made like, a zillion dollars off of their 80 remakes of skyrim alone.
---
The pink ones are Bolton fans.
---
The problem isn't melee dmg... the problem is the distinct imbalance between melee vs ranged.  Personally, if history has any bearing, I would expect to see the armor penetration perk for melee nerfed to the same range as rifles.  But, they'd probably also nerf some of the things that take melee over the top as well, over nerfing and dropping melee out of phase.
---
There will ALWAYS be a best option... and the majority will flock to it.  The trick is to still keep other options viable... and with the difference between melee and ranged that we have right now, it's just too large of a gap.
---
You're telling the wrong person brother.
---
If i find a scorch beast on me in a place  they normally aren't. I exit the server. It isn't worth the severe armor damage or the 3 days worth of bullets to deal with it.  If they reduced the patrol distance of them around fissures id be happy.Hell lets have an event that gets rid of them except for nuclear launch zones. 
---
 Their flight paths are what caused everyone to build in the same green noob area as everyone else. If i wanted to go find somewhere to drop the homestead. Your either dealing with a scorchbeast or a random pack of lvl 50+ supermutants.  I don't need that shit every time i log in. Hell the nerf made it so we need to do another 20-50% of grinding to come out even after a fight like that. I don't want to repair my base on top of it every time i log in. 
---
Fucking games  like pulling teeth to soak in any fun.
---
Ok, can't disagree with the "Sharks in the water"...   
---
But I'm still not fully sold on this being intentionally "half-asses"...  
---
I really think, maybe naively, that this came down to insufficient internal testing and an Echo-Chamber that was either too afraid to rock the boat or legitimately failed to see the flaws.
---
Damn you for being reasonable. Have an upvote. :)

As you say.  Excuse my while I enjoy myself at your expense.

i gave up on looking for generators ages ago because of the patch, i’m now relying on frames and poseidon. frames get me just enough cores for my power armor for a while but if i try to use my gatling laser i run out in minutes
---
They make me sad too. Especially when one says "I'ts all over the world" just before I kill it. I think to myself. Damn he was trying to give me information! ...Seems like the fallout is global and there is no escape.
---
There just imported dragons that had their stats over buffed to an annoying point 
---
My understanding of the Bloodied effect is that you need to be at low HP to increase you damage.  Doesn’t that balance things out a bit as you can be easily taken down too? 
---
JuSt UsE fIrEpRoOf

Doesn't help if you're on a melee build. The attack rotation needs work. Making it possible to cripple wings and force them onto the ground would be nice too...

Tbh, I would only spend money if the items were actually cool. Like the blackbird paint. Plus the possibilities for outfits from other games. Give me an elite riot gear outfit and Ill pay $5-10. 
---
The trick is to use a 10mm smg and wait for it to land.

And in a panic you opened photomode and had time to salute them.
---
I play fairly often, unfortunately I have noticed a decline in player count for servers. Definitely not as full as when I started.
---
The only way the end game will get interesting to me is with a reset, so many dupes there's no possibility of a healthy economy.
---
 and get a massive repair bill
---
It's fun at the cost of others. Queens are boring so now we RP as raiders. Hide your junk
---
No, it’s a sign of incredibly bad server stability. I’m feeling the same way, had it happen to me as well a lot. what is even worse though, is certain events that sometimes delete your hard earned gear from the game. Well known bugs since the god damn launch, and not a thing has been done... furthermore Bethesda REFUSES to restore the lost gear caused by their shitty game... playing the game is definitely not worth it in the long run.
---
No it's not.
---
Army hat, welding googles, surgery mask, and green outfit with combat boots.
---
I look like a mass murderer .
---
Thanks this is great info
---
Ah the classic double-down defense.
---
Sort of. There are three or four unopened Vaults around Appalachia. Players have managed to glitch into them, and they’re furnished - I’m assuming they’ll be something dungeon-like akin to the nuke silos. 
---
Survival mode, apparently Trader bot things, more PVP. I heard other vaults
---
I know the spot. The scorchbeasts will not stop, and will get worse. My friend who built there ended up moving away as well.
---
Lol what a genuine personality this one has. 
---
Finally we get to the root of it.
---
Thats funny!  My guy started off as a mouth breather and now he’s a general.  Still ugly tho.
---
Next month they’re adding a new PvP mode. They’ve also mentioned player vending and Vault raids, but they haven’t released any more details on those yet. Through data mining, we also know that they’re adding a new Enclave event where players compete to hold ballots across the map. There’s been no official word on that yet though.
---
My point is that melee should be way more OP than ranged weapons because the range disadvantage you are have when using melee weapons.  
---
Speaking of bugs... I know this is completely off topic, but I just got attacked by a molerat whose name was labeled incorrectly as "Opossum". I found it pretty amusing.
---
How to move items from one character to another?
---
Same
---
Sounds like you need to move man hah
---
Trader bot things? What's that? And what will be the purpose of ther vaults? New quests? Dungeons? Do we know anything yet?
---
I do the challenges constantly so no need to buy any. Nor would I. I'm not a fan of pay for cosmetics in a game. 
---
The only time I've put out real money for a skin was when Overwatch had one and the money went to charity. I'm ok with those kind of things. 
---
i wont defend them.. i hate them, but, i will share what i have learned.. fireproof helps.. ALOT i can now fight 3 at once without needing power armor, of course with pa on it makes it alot easier it seems to me (less pushing and just general being moved around.

keep the sb kinda centered of screen if possible, look for the smaller doughnuts to zero in on about where they are in general. keep a cheap vats gun to switch to as well, vats can target and hit through a completely doughnut covered blue screen. i will vats them until ap is gone (using anti armor lever action bout 8 shots i think), then switch to my shotgun fire off 2 or 3 blasts to the center of the smaller doughnuts (hoping to cripple), then to my handmade and run through a clip (35 rnd armor piercing) then ap should be refreshed and back to lever action, when i get them on ground its shotgun to the face time.
---
i guess its just i enjoy the abuse from these things and the annoyance of fighting these things but yesterday i fought 5 different groups of 3.. course i wasnt like some of the others on here, i seemed to get a lvl 50, lvl 60 or 65, and a level 80.  mix. i always have good with salt perk equipped so i really enjoy having all the sb food to eat for their buffs, and aside from ribeye steaks i prefer those over anything. im a glutton for punishment i see one flappin around i head for em, especially if they are attacking someone, managed to save several low levels over last few weeks.
---
more than likely it stems from all the unwanted assaults i suffered as a noob at the hands of these things. its my chance to enact revenge from being violated so many times at a young age and just out of the vault.  
---
absolutely hate the amount of ammo and time it takes to kill one.. my shotgun does absolutely no damage to it in the air even at 260 dmg a shot, all it manages to do is cripple/stun it to the ground.. then i can face shot the hell out of it for actual dmg at close range. 
---
not a pretty fight or easy, but manageable and i run through maybe 3 or 4 stimpaks a fight which i always seem to get 1 or 2 off a body as well as meats. only real loss is 100 or so rounds of ammo. 
---
This would actually be hilarious.
---
I'd love to have a character that exists in a functioning vault experiment.  Similar to how you came across the vault 112, and got to experience the experiment to some degree.
---
I love that the creature is behind a secret passage way leading to a secret chem lab, behind another secret wall.
---
Also the notes seem to imply the interloper is really, really old. That it was the first of the trees or something, and that it fed on blood. It really reminds me of the movie Apostle on netflix. I wonder if it has any connection to the Scorched fungal hivemind, or the Stranglers found in the bog. Perhaps whatever havok vault 96 unleashed with their GECK was affected. Like they activated their GECK to terraform an area, but it was near Interloper vines, and supercharged them, creating the Stranglers of the Mire or something. I am getting more and more outlandish.
---
I'm going to take your advice and scope out a set of Bolstering Trapper armor, not for nuke zone as I don't tend to team up so no sharing Rad Sponge, but would like to mess with the glowy ones at Whitespring. I can kill them melee just fine with my Glowing Perk and Ghoul Dagger (can't remember the name) but the rads they spew mean lots of RadX Diluted and that just boring.
---
It looks like the dragon priest masks to me.
---
Cores in generators are on long respawn timers. They have been looted already and have not respawned. I have only found 2 cores in fusion generators since the change.
---
I've spent thousands of atoms and still have thousands. No real money spent though.
---
One time me and a couple friends went back to one of our camps and four fucking scorchbeasts showed up. We won but it was a hell of a fight. I died several times being level 15.
---
Now this is some legitimate criticism. Some of the bitches on this subreddit just have a litany of complaints because gaming life isn't like real life for them. Meanwhile they're like level 1,076 &amp; prob don't do anything BUT play this game. Nonetheless, there are probs. Like scorchbeast mechanics. 
---
I've had so many experiences where it's just like you say, nothing but those circles raining down upon me from skyward, mixed with reverb- and delay-laden Screeches, (not even the Saved By the Bell kind), plus you're pretty much fucking blind with all the shit going on around you. So those scorchbeasts, ahem I mean Sierra Bravos, essentially eliminate your sight and hearing.
---
You ever fast travel away from them and they come with you to your C.A.M.P.? Nice. U ever fast travel to train station &amp; one's DIRECTLY ABOVE YOU? Ever go to Cranberry Bog for a mission and hafta hide from SBs in the cranberry forests while breathing toxic air?
---
Haha I actually kinda like all this punishment now that I put it all into words. The Fallout universe oughtta be tough as nails to live thru. It would be an inauthentic experience otherwise and disingenuous to the spirit of the game.
---
tl;dr Preach!
---
Repairing it to 200% gives it hella high damage, but that damage scales back rapidly, by 125% you'll lose most of it.
---
It's a waste of time, don't know why you bothered.
---
I am just over here hoping it gets better. I imagine the MMOs I mention now and then went through something like this when they came out over seas. Black Desert had it problems when it ported to the EU/US Market. After a year it seemed to become a lot better game. I am just over here hoping for the best. I am not going to lie I am one F-up from Bethesda being like. I am out. 
---
Wish the skull mask gave the filtration bonus of a burlap sack that Im wearing now. 
---
Except it's not similar at all since there's no hordes of AI enemies that now become a chore to overload their spongey absorption powers with your Super Soaker water gun that then makes resource gathering and repairing feel like a job.
---
They need to put an effing high cooldown on those screams. You cannot see sh-- when you're getting hit by those sonic beams, and they shoot you A LOT of those. If you cannot see, you cannot shoot them properly. 
---
Your only option is wait for them to land (they never want to land) and destroy them as fast as you can, and if you can't, there goes another ten minutes of not seeing anything and receiving free damage while you escape or wait for them to land again.
---
That's not funny, that's not hard or advanced combat mechanics. That's tedious. 
---
But since when do scorchbeasts go to the whitespring
---
Melee VATS teleporting with Gun Fu is more than a little ridiculous...
---
Post your own gametag and let market forces dictate who "gets it".
---
Yeah, sounds like OP is *really* reaching for the bottom of the barrel to cause a new controversy. They gave him back the atoms. They let him keep the skin. They were not rude or incompetent whatsoever and yet OP wants to act like BETHESDA is in the wrong here
---
Yep, this happened to me a few times about a month ago. Since then, I've done a better job of staying under the encumbrance limit (and not dying), but maybe this is yet another bug that's back after recent patches.
---
When I tried it my friend and I couldn’t get the effect to proc. Who knows though it could work now. We tested this about 2-3 patches ago
---
Right now it's the inspectors outfit from the atom shop, the mole mascot head and a flaming shiskebab for some flare. 
---
What if you REALLY REALLY want something but it came out on a weekend when you were too busy and didn’t get a chance to play the game?
---
What if you REALLY REALLY want something but it came out a few days after something else you REALLY REALLY wanted? 
---
I have $4. That is not at all the point. 
---
The atom shop is cosmetic only and is nowhere close to what EA was doing but here's my gripe with it: there's nothing in the atom shop worth buying. Most of the items are niche or simple reskins (which often miss the mark).
---
Clothing they are selling? Most are literally just for memes like the college kid track suit, dresses and the like. If they had more cool armor like FONV riot gear or legion gear or FO3 Enclave armor and more content that took themselves seriously, I'd be okay with dropping money. 
---
He said under cover, if they have radar it stops at the surface of the cover...
---
nice tip.  I got disconnected at the Glassed Cavern too.  only once thank god.  I think it's because they didn't have enough SB's and Scorched attacking me at once.   2nd run though, 2 SBs and 15+ Scorcheds starting at the 3rd transponder.  Died about 5 times.  It was rough.  Eventually found the final transponder, but i was slow and I definitely drained all my ammo/resources.
---
After reading this I logged in and tested something and created this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/anudu3/bug_vats_broken_since_last_patch/
---
I had the similar impression since the last patch. 
---
Yeah they were okay with charging us money for that in the "wonderful" 'creation club'
---
Thanks for speaking for the entire player base by using the word "Nobody."
---
I hadn't known I didn't want this until you told me.  Thank you for helping me make such a tough decision.
---
since always sadly
---
Well that makes no sense... How are you gunna have a character for melee, rifles, trading, pistols, heavy weapons, mutations, explosives, shotguns, unarmed, sneak... all on the one character?
---
I thought mobs stopping at an invisible line letting you pick them off was fixed.  Killed e Snallygasters around the capital building that just stopped at some invisible line and let me take pit shots at them.
---
Man, I would give anything to have been able to have seen what **actually** went on during the development of this game.
---
Then be sure to pass it along to the Devs! ;-)
---
When I die, just throw me in the trash. 
---
My group of friends used to have to make 2 TEAMS so we could do shit together.
---
I see Scorchbeasts at Whitesprings frequently. It's not a good spot for a camp.
---
I would say it's part of the tradeoff of being next door to the top legendary farming spot on the map.
---
No problem! 
---
yeah true i just love my view too much :'(
---
😂😂😂
---
Since there is a fissure at the gates..
---
The vaults I dont know if its confirmed or not.
---
I heard we're getting robots to build for trading but I think it might be speculation
---
Yeah, personally, I found the "ending" to be terrible and this game, overall, to be a complete waste of time. There is no actual story in this game that strays much from that of any other Fallout game. (is it even possible to "finish" the "Follow the Overseers Journey" quest??)
---
I can't believe the "endgame" is to launch a nuke. And I guess I just have to scratch my head with regard to some of the comments here about how running around collecting stuff is fun. I didn't find MOST of the game fun. Endless inventory / carrying capacity management is not fun. Collecting "stuff" to build better things to get past obstacles to furthering the story is supposed to be fun, but with all of the bugs, crashes and quirks, it rarely actually felt like fun. 
---
And it's a shame, too, because the world is realized fairly well, and there are moments when I thought things were about to get really interesting, but they never did. The Enclave and MODUS are really creepy to me, but launching a nuke should've been the beginning of a more involved and interesting story line, not the end of it. 
---
I see zero purpose in all the grinding necessary to launch a nuke and collect "nuke stuff" to make high-end things since a) some of the nuke stuff expires relatively quickly and b) there's no real purpose in making higher-end things since there's nothing else to do by that point.
---
And considering the fact that I solo launched a nuke at level 52 (maybe 54?), I cannot comprehend what people are doing or how much time they're spending in the game to get to level 200+ as I've seen the last few days. I just don't get it.
---
I don't quite understand why Bethesda made this a multi-player game. To me, removing NPC humans and having the only humans we deal with be other players made the game a lot worse than if it was single player. I had exactly one interaction with another player, in terms of talking with them. Some really nice guy told me how to take advantage of all the pre-patch exploits so that I didn't haven't deal with managing inventory quite so much. 
---
Ok, I take that back, the other day, some Level 17 guy had either built or claimed a huge base at Poseidon energy plant, so I claimed it from and then stood there and one-shotted him about 8 times while he tried to claim it back. THAT was actually fun, but you'd have to be a Grade-A jerk to do that more than once or twice unless you really needed some Fusion Cores, since it was plenty easy enough to claim that unclaimed workshop otherwise and just have the Fusion Core Processor start cranking them out.
---
I guess I also get kind of bored with the fact that nothing you do in these games has any real effect on the world. That started with Fallout 3 with that Oasis quest line. I (wrongly) expected that if I chose to help the tree flourish, that the "life" would start to spread out throughout the world, as the quest info indicated would happen. But it was pointless because neither decision had any effect on the world.
---
Anyway, to each his/her own, but for me, this whole game was a big disappointment. And, honestly, Bethesda should be entirely embarrassed by how buggy this game has been, and continues to be. They seem so behind the times in terms of both tech and polish that it's sad.
---
I think you can wander around the area beforehand and see if there are ghouls spawning, and server hop if not.
---
Which people have explained is due to high base damages being able to actually break through armor
---
Bold of you to assume anyone is listening
---

enjoy
---
Weren't these faces on buildings in the first two Fallout games as well? I strongly remember something like that on like the corner of tall buildings and such. Not sure if they're supposed to represent something though.
---
Thank you! Love this game! You guys are all doing a bang-up job
---
Fastening up is perfectly cromulent.
---
I understand,  psycho is a hell of a chem.
---
Fair enough. I would be pretty upset too. Luckily I have had good experiences with strangers so far.
---
How much is it out of curiosity? 
---
Every server that I have logged into (XBox) has plenty of people in it. \*shrug\*
---
You’re not wrong. You. Are. Not. Wrong.
---
You could be!  Most people seem to be reducing their health even more for bloodied!
---
if your on ps4 look me up psn: Silune  
---
would be glad to play escort/bodyguard for ya to help ya get through it..
---
That does explain why I couldn't change to my Hard Bargain Perk card when I went to ASDA, they just stared at me with *that* look, had to pay normal prices :( They were all out of Grape Mentats at the chemist too, bugger!!
---
It's because you get a shit ton of carry weight from strength AND you use no ammo. Enemies hit like a wet noodle when you wear power armor or run a proper bloodied build, so having to take a few hits means nothing, especially if you have healing factor. It's extremely efficient and cuts out all the monotonous bullshit like constantly having to farm for materials to make bullets and repair multiple weapons. 
---
They never should have nerfed anything. They should have just taken the time to balance PvE and PvP separately. PvP has fucked this game already. Stacking damage with rifles now requires you to sacrifice almost all your strength for luck, which ends up costing you a ton of carry weight, making the game annoying AF. That and it's still much weaker than melee. 
---
I did the same about a month ago. Haven't gone back in. I don't miss it, and reading this subreddit and the patch notes of each subsequent update keep me in the loop on how much I'm not missing out on...
---
I've instead spent my time playing God of war (ps4) which is honestly amazing and so well done.
---
I keep my CAMP in a lower level area of the map and keep everything unlocked so lower levels can access the water filters, use any workbenches and use the bed or musical instruments for a boost.  That also has the added benefit of being in a lower area the mobs are more easily killed by the missile turrets.  Mole rats, low scorched, robots or supermutants at most, though there was the odd time I came back to 3 dead Scorchbeasts laying on the roof.
---
I wouldn't say that first post you linked is whiny. It's not generalized, it's not inherently negative. It sounds like you and others have been trying to provide useful detailed feedback and suggestions and you feel ignored, and you're linking back to that feedback. 
---
That aside, I can't really comment on the thread's purpose. I've already explained why I think Bethesda accepting help from unpaid non-employees is a problem. So I'm not really surprised they're not actively working with modders.
---
The only part of that thread I'd call into question is the idea of 'ignoring'. I think there are many reasons why Bethesda employees may be unable or unwilling to use suggestions or to directly reply to the people providing them. I would need more information (that is unlikely to be provided by either side) before I could agree with the idea that Bethesda is just ignoring and not using this data.
---
Your second post is definitely more controversial, I think. You're basically asking for a direct line into Bethesda, for no better reason than 'we're modders'. I'm not going to claim that the average player knows as much as the average modder, but it doesn't really make sense to me that any studio would be like "OK we'll give you a privilege that lets you leapfrog over other players". I totally get that you're trying to help-- and I agree you would likely help more than the rest of us-- but it just doesn't seem fair or responsible. 
---
I'd also guess that you got more downvotes because some of the people on this sub are tired of the negativity. It's rampant and it's turning this sub into the Fallout sub. While the beginning of that second post is quite reasonable, the end starts to dabble in the 'should I even play this game' and 'people are leaving the game' territory (when you talk about friends lists) and that's the kind of thing that's just getting old and useless day by day.
---
Overall I would say it seems like you have positive motivations. And I understand your struggle. But I also see a lot of complications with what you're trying to do, and in the end I'm not really surprised by Bethesda's lack of enthusiastic response. I would even go so far as to speculate-- just speculate-- that Bethesda would rather have modders do their thing when private servers hit, which will at that time be a big booster for the game's popularity and sales. Strictly as a business decision.
---
I also love the idea of the daedra influencing the world of Fallout! 
---
The male face being the founder of a company I find it more difficult to believe because of the buried face in Dunwich Borers from Fallout 4. I mean, why would anyone bury a simple bronze statue of some corporation founder ? To me, it has something to do with the entity that wealthy people were worshiping. 
---
When I heard Devs get the uninstall stats I went ahead and uninstalled hoping to be part of a movement to get this game back on the rails, but my guess is Bethesda is panicking that the stink from this game will linger over the release of  skyrim. Which if they use the same engine will be equally as unimpressive and poorly received. 
---
my next purchase is the nuka cola stash box
---
market being the key word... $$$
---
Cool.  I picked up a good deathclaw gauntlet recently. Gotta try it before it’s nerfed.  
---
They will probably open up shelters (94, 96 and 64).  
---
My hope is that each will have a long quest line (and sub-quests).  
---
They might also open up all the areas in the Whitespring area closed by hand scanners.  
---
I also hope they would flesh out the Toxic Valley, maybe open up something around the space station ? 
---
My Chrome Minigun skin doesn't work on the Gatling Gun! Um ex- *cuuuuuuuse* me Blizzard but what the fuck, Bungie?
---
The screeching is the most rage inducing part of this game, if you aren't in a group so someone else can attack while you're blind, it's an actual nightmare. I have straight up left a world while defending the ammo dump because it was a scorchbeast attack and not a normal attack with hounds or some super mutants.
---
When they attack nonstop makes me want to quit. Even when it's not constantly attacking the the pattern is normal. Going completely blind and shaky screen is just frustrating over anything else
---
That's fine, but in the current game it's still overpowered compared to other options.
---
...and they're bad at both things.
---
duping?
---
I want it too. Was so annoyed when I heard this. Wanted a Lone Wanderer bike or a mechanic giddycup buddycup.
---
Yeah I've earned about ~6000 atoms just playing the game, doing dailies/weeklies and focusing on a few lifetime challenges. 
---
I stopped player after the TSE nerf. I know people have strong feelings against those weapons, but all of the nerfs were overreaching in my opinion. There's barely any pvp in this game so why are you nerfing stuff to balance pvp? Just let us blow shit up and have fun.
---
Just play the game you don’t need handouts 
---
Dude i was so tired of griefing/scorchbeasts/pretaken locations. I built in the corner of the whole fucking game on top of a whoville mountain. Not a damn thing spawns out there. No turrets needed and their is only one way up and its an annoying climb so even if some asshole comes and griefs it they deserve it. 
---
Though it comes at a cost of being in the most useless/expensive teleport location ever. So i have to warp to vault76 then wherever i want to go. But you know id rather deal with a second load screen than deal with the ptsd of that thing's screams. 
---
I've been saying this forever, this should have been an expansion to fallout 4. No one would have expected amazing things, but it would have given them time to figure out the balancing issues.
---
I went back to Neverwinter lol can't put that down and it's a free to play.....
---
Based on D&amp;D
---
Sadly true
---
Character 3 was where it died for me. But my 2nd was melee and it was fun to build as it was super powerful and everything was pretty easy. I had the dumb idea that 3 would be a full auto character... lol! What a joke. fifty bullets later you might kill a scorn. And then your gun falls apart.
---
I agree with almost everything.  Here's my thoughts:
---
* Power armor is VERY strong as is.  The only real benefit to opting out of it is to sneak and the legendary effects of conventional armor pieces.  I have a stealth sniper and a power armor melee character, and the one with power armor is WAY WAY more durable bone stock than the sniper, even if the sniper has blocker 3, barbarian 2, evasive 1 and ironclad 2 swapped in.  Adding in legendary power armor pieces and frames would make conventional armor a far inferior choice, and further water down the random lootgen pool in trying to find that certain needle in a haystack of a great item that you or one of your friends can use.
---
* I'm largely ok with a general TSE nerf because it was insanely strong initially, but I agree that it does need to be rolled back a bit.  Explosive +20% aoe seems fine, but two shot should be at least +50% bonus damage.  The nerf was way too ham fisted.  Excluding shotguns from either 2 shot or explosive affixes (explosive buck would likely explode in the barrel as it jostles IRL) would solve the major issue of a multi-projectile weapon benefiting from 2 shot and explosive on each pellet.  Heavy weapons that were underpowered and relatively inaccurate became good with TSE and slow firing sniper rifles were never cheesing through content even with the full TSE boost.  I mostly agree with you, but TSE doesn't need a full rollback.  It just needs a more surgical approach that eliminates certain overperforming weapons from having the combo. (perhaps shotgun explosive ammo affix could behave like it did with auto tesla rifles and flamers, where it was reduced to a single explosive projectile, as if the gun were loaded with explosive slugs, which actually makes sense IRL)
---
"but you can place them in your stash 1 at a time and then retrieve them later."
---
Really? Ill have to try that later. Always found it annoying you cant pick up more than one at a time and it might not be there when you go back to it. 
---
I’ve killed quite a few there tbh
---
I have been purposely aging and putting wear and tear on my character every 25 lvls.  Little things to make me feel like the character has gone through some hard times since leaving the vault.
---
yeah but it just never happened before
---
exactly
---
Confirmed, the UK are just a bunch of filthy Duppers, I'm suitably embarrassed.
---
Hmm....did they announce free content? I don't recall mention of a season pass....
---
Admit it: Y'all bought the Nuka-Rocketsuit just so you can stare at that *amazing* ass
---
Rifleman affects plasma throwers. Weird, I know. Probably a bug.
---
They’re a really underrated weapon and quite fun to use. Problem is the durability and ammo scarcity. 
---
I've been playing BATTLETECH for a week now, great game if you like turn based strategy games.  That and I've been playing FO4 since I put 500 hours into it without ever finishing the story line for any faction lol.  I really need to just make a master save and then play all three to the ending.
---
You are what we call an OG
---
&gt; Yeah same, I only even have 2 poimts in fireproof and it does next to zero damage.
---
It's not "next to" for me though, it is literally no damage at all. The bar doesn't move.
---
Not exactly what you might prefer, but I ran into the responder vendor robot and he had 6 fusion cores for sale. Iirc 350 ? each.
---
We're witnessing one of the worst decisions in game history, before our eyes
---
Issue?   You mean read comprehension issue on the part of the OP?
---
I thought about it a little bit more and I do really love this game. At times it has this strange, hypnotic, zen quality when it comes to the base building, decorating, and junk gathering... I just hope in the end that it lives up to all of it's potential and they implement some crazy fun off the wall stuff to add variety to the end game. I also really really hope they fix the damn stability issues because I have been disconnected like 20 times today and it just wears on you!
---
This might also explain the two "Aspects" of the Mothman. Aggressive or Peaceful
---
Sooooo... If I'm just screwing around by myself, and I nuke the prime fissure site, and a whole bunch of high level toons spawn in carrying 400 pounds of equipment each, what's going to happen? My client's going to crash and I'll have wasted the nuke, unless I join some rando's team (no offense to the randos out there but...). So really, I only nuke the prime fissure spot when I'm with friends, which frankly is pretty rare because I only have time to play in the morning.
---
I actually have the same problem with the Whitespring - nine times out of ten my client crashes two or three minutes into it once other toons show up. So if you're by yourself your best bet is to nuke a place that not everybody is interested in, it's more stable.
---
Agreed. Fuck them hoes
---
So far only $20 worth.  Most everything I've bought is from in game earned Atoms.
---
Vats is bugged. I've missed ridiculously easy 95% shots multiple times in a row since the last patch. 
---
they were easy to kill pre tse nerf.. now not so much.. i miss pre tse nerf days..
---
Sometimes they also bring back the old bugs, for the classic nostalgia vibes. It's a sneak-preview of the eventual 'Vanilla FO76' release.
---
Crashes to desktop! Servers not responding! Whitespring robots spawning endlessly and firing at nothing perpetually!
---
With maxed hard bargain perk card its 466 caps, without hard bargain is 530ish. 
---
Im already away from the bunker.
---
Move perk points around as you change builds. 
---
You wonder why "official" responses say that they'll pass the info on to the developers?
---
It's because nobody who actually works on the game in any way that really matters reads or gives a shit about the majority of the astonishingly stupid shit people write on the internet about these games.
---
Because Faction Stuff should be in the game and not as Atom Shop items
---
What? 
---
Mostly steel, lead, plastic, screws, springs, adhesives.
---
dunno i like it. you have to make use of the terrain/environment to deal with the encounter effectively.
---
My camp gets attacked by 3 at least once a day. I'm not near any fissures but I might be near a random event spawn or something but it's super annoying.  Most times I just quit.
---
TBF No Man's Sky had a nice period of updates in the last year and became very playable.
---
But I still agree with your premise.
---
I completely understand where your coming from. I had three scrorchedbeast attack my camp. They obliterated everything that I worked so hard to make. So yeah.... Fuck the scrorchedbeast
---
I trying to get back into conceal gaming. I have Tales of Vesperia. Thats another thing that is stopping from quitting on F76 is that I like to grind in my JRPG. So grinding for gear in F76 does not make me to made. 
---
TILL WERE LIFELESS TOGETHER
---
Tedious. If I had to describe how FO76 felt to me it would be Tedious. 
---
That's never a descriptor I look for in a game. I've put FO76 down around christmas and have not played it since. 
---
Any ranged hit at close range has a very high chance of not even applying damage since the last f u patch.
---
I’ve nearly given up on my shotguns because of it.
---
So you'd rather pay $40 for DLC packages?  You're going to be getting them all free.  
---
Or maybe some SERIOUS wood armor....(ignore the creeping corruption effect)
---
If melee doesn’t have a distinct advantage then why would anyone want to use it?  How do you think it should be balanced?  
---
Found a bunch of plans in the watoga register once, some of which I didn’t have.
---
I’ve also found good legendaries that were sold to vendors including an anti armor harpoon gun which I still use, and a 3*** Furious Deathclaw Gauntlet with Limb Damage and Reduced Weight. Sold that to another player for 2k. 
---
I try to see if there’s other players near me when I drop stuff in suitcases or registers to increase the chance the someone sees it
---
Just roll us back to the 2000s slap a server browser on it and let us host with mods. 
---
I'd make scrapper give back screws, gears, and springs.
---
I'm on PC.  I mentioned that I had to ctrl/alt/del to get out of the game, ie force-quit out.
---
I‘m still Level 57 and have Not Seen everything and i still enjoy exploring and doing some quest.
---
I‘m casual.
---
One thing seriously annoys me and that‘s scorchbeasts that randomly appear and seem unkillable for me. Only chance for me killing them is with my black powder rifle.
---
But i guess that is just because i do not have great gear.
---
maybe with auto repair perk from luck could keep it up?
---
Would be a cool dlc. We get to explore an undiscovered Slocum's factory, where they tested new flavors and drinks. We could weaponize the coffee and donuts
---
Yeah, those Poseidon caps used to be fairly consistent for caps farming pre-patch, but are more often than not empty or entirely missing post-patch.  However, I know you can loot them more than once, because I have claimed the one on the oil drum twice since the patch was implemented.
---
Then you are SOL. Again, if you really wanted it you would have checked everyday. Nothing would have stopped you. Sense of awareness you need.
---
Valid points...   
---
I think having legitimate gripes and being able to air them is important, and even having a "smash the keyboard" day and post is acceptable, "if" the broader history is mostly constructive.   
---
But just because someone has 2 posts, and a full half of both is a rant,'it should not be fully dismissed because more often than not, in my opinion, there is often something in the post, the root of it, that either reveals a flaw / bug or does a good breakdown of the situation.   
---
I understand and mostly agree regarding MODAuthors...  
---
Any time you accept outside help, especially when your seem to be in a position of weakness it can be risky....  
---
However I honestly think Bethesda/Zenimax is missing a golden opportunity.  
---
Bringing someone on, publicly, to assist could be seen in an exceptional light, "they are taking this seriously" etc.   If they "hired" someone, Even if it was primarily a figure head role, it could be spun well.   
---
Their largest issue right now (IMHO) is the perception the community, active and potential, has.  
---
As much as people discount the feedback from this sub, based on the public sales numbers we represent 5% - 9% of the community, which is significant, and the number one complaint (outside of stability and broken quests) is a lack of communications and transparency.   
---
Bringing someone on who's sole job for example was so sort through the posts (you can't catch them all) and find the info that's helpful or reflective of a larger issue that needs to be addressed and being able to say something other than "We've passed it on to the Dev's" would go a long, long way.  
---
That said, I'm biased, I've been fighting for a better communication system for a while, I just want a better way to communicate with the Dev's to get issues to them vs what feels like staring into a black hole.  
---
Even if they don't bring in authors, they need to (IMHO) find some voices in the community who they can trust, who are not "YesMen" and can provide input based upon actual game play, vs a Dev doing a run through a specific situation that is not reflective of the game/game play as whole 
---
I don't think private servers are coming until they resolve the majority of the stability, balance and gameplay (quests etc) issues, and based on what we can extrapolate from the previous patches it's going to be a long time.
---
I guess I thought it was instanced for every player but really, it's open for anyone to grab.
---
Check the overseer boxes and suitcases at train stations
---
Bethesda barely monitors this forum at all. The community manager "passes on info" to the devs which is immediately disregarded, but she says it to placate the masses who have never had a job similar to hers. 
---
I do a similar job to her, and all the time customers ask me for some kind of feature request, bug fix, random text change etc. I tell them I'll talk with the devs, which I do. 
---
The devs say lolno, dev time is way too valuable to screw around with that crap. I shrug and say I tried. That's literally the state of the game right now. They have 400 thousand critical core issues, are hemorrhaging players (and by extension, profit) like mad which means they will have management screeching about profit losses etc. Dev time is a very valuable and highly sought after resource. They can either spend their time fixing the critical issues and core functions of the game, or they can waste days and days trying to rework Scorchbeasts to be less annoying. In their eyes, they still function, which is better than nothing, so fixing the AI is a very low priority. 
---
It sucks for sure, especially because the devs highest priority appears to be appeasing the management that is screeching about losing players, so they are just making the grind longer because they think that will increase player retention if it takes longer to do everything
---
Clearly based on the downvotes on my comment most don't agree ;)
---
Yeah I'm bored of people posting "*I'm out after this patch / balance / glitch / ridiculous own mistake / bad session*".
---
Fine. It wasn't for you then go, dude. If we dont see you later then good luck with the next game.
---
Do they make people turn down the music at parties so they can announce they are leaving?
---
I went through the same damn thing with Whitesprings (not nuked). There were three of then when I spawned in and with all the screeching I couldn't see where I was. I thought they'd have disappeared after they killed me but instead they were just flapping about. Ran in with a health regen from food and quick transferred my stuff. I ended up going into the Enclave base and fast traveling from there. Wrecked my armor though and had to fix that, which we all know is costly without the right perks.
---
I've have both Armorer 3\* and Fix-it-Good 3\* when I'm repairing or crafting, then it's the cheapest for mats and 200% repair, that give a substantial increase in Armor stats so I think is well worth the Perk points.
---
They don't stay selected, only when at the workshop.
---
Amen. I might have supported crafting specialty ammo or weapon treatments, or they could have done some really interesting things with energy weapons instead of, you know, making them useless garbage. Better options than some magic weapon you take off a ghoul that is "legendary" for some reason, despite looking and behaving exactly like every other ghoul. 
---
Beth marketed this game as "rebuilding" the country, and really hyped the interaction with other players, then seemingly did every conceivable thing they could do to neuter both those experiences. I don't know what kind of game they intended to make but what they put out there is a kind of shitty looter shooter. Disappointing. 
---
"a game that had been advertised as having ‘always-on PvP’."
---
I see this sentiment a lot and it's not supported with evidence. The following is exactly how Bethesda describes Fallout 76 on their website store:
---
"*Bethesda Game Studios, the creators of* ***Skyrim*** *and* ***Fallout 4****, welcome you to* ***Fallout 76****,  the online prequel where every surviving human is a real person. Work  together, or not, to survive. Under the threat of nuclear annihilation,  experience the largest world ever created in* ***Fallout****. Play solo or join together as you explore, quest, and triumph against the wasteland’s greatest threats.*
---
*Bethesda Game Studios, the award-winning creators of* ***Skyrim*** *and* ***Fallout 4****, welcome you to* ***Fallout 76****,  the online prequel where every surviving human is a real person. Work  together, or not, to survive. Under the threat of nuclear annihilation,  you’ll experience the largest, most dynamic world ever created in the  legendary* ***Fallout*** *universe.*
---
*Reclamation Day, 2102. Twenty-five years after the bombs fall, you  and your fellow Vault Dwellers—chosen from the nation’s best and  brightest – emerge into post-nuclear America. Play solo or join together  as you explore, quest, build, scavenge and triumph against the  wasteland’s greatest threats*."
---
Here is how [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) is selling Fallout 76:
---
"*Bethesda Game Studios, the award-winning creators of Skyrim and  Fallout 4, welcome you to Fallout 76, the online prequel where every  surviving human is a real person. Work together, or not, to survive.  Under the threat of nuclear annihilation, you’ll experience the largest,  most dynamic world ever created in the legendary Fallout universe.*

---
Not a word about PVP. "PVP" isn't even used and none of this says "always-on PVP."			 						
---
Oh this for sure. I barely have the time to play. What cool stuff might I have missed? Who knows. Even ESO has posts letting you know when limited time goodies will be available. Some heads up would be nice. 
---
Well, there's the Interloper. 
---
...y'know, now that I look at it, it does look like he's landing on his back and the Mothman is yelping out in pain
---
Then wouldn't be able to switch your build without a back breaking amount of grinding every single time you wanna change. That's dumb.
---
So is having an empty nuke zone with no enemies :)
---
150 flux gathered, only can craft 4-7 flux because not enough enemies to gather off of.
---
Yes, they do appear in classic Fallout. I must say I didn't play the games, so I don't really know. In the other thread, people argued that it was just art-deco motifs, without any meaning. Maybe Bethesda built onto that?
---
(Another example: https://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/12698-fallout-windows-screenshot-the-cathedral-these-guys-worship.jpg)
---
Everybody always downvotes almost everything I say because I have kind of... I don't know, a weird style of communicating I guess. And I'm just a weird person really.
---
It was originally scheduled for release in 2017, after being delayed from 2014 after the Kickstarter.
---
at least with a TSE weapon they were somewhat balanced,now they are just straight up OP
---
So if i made this into a bunker I may survive a nuke lol would be nice thought....
---
Sorry, I was chopping onions for my tacos. Please continue.
---
Depends what weapon you are using. I'm crafting 10 000 bullets for my .45 Combat Rifle and doing a few scorchbeast queen makes them dissapear pretty fast. I'm not complaining i can manage but it takes all my acid away from doing anything else.
---
Where did you get the curtains?
---
This "wood" be an interesting idea as a power armor that could be utilized by stealth builds, perhaps somewhere in line with the defensive capability of raider power armor (no one in their right mind would opt for raider armor when they have ultracite, T-51 and X-01 as far better options) but quiet and stealthy with high radiation resist, so that stealth builds don't have to go naked into nuke zones with just a hazmat suit.
---
Based on my dumb ass's accidental experiments, that's a great big negative, at least not in PA and loaded up with Rad-X. It's insta-death the moment the nuke touches ground, even if I'm at the edge of the red circle.
---
Wut? Just shoot the center of ring...
---
I hope we get something like this in the future. Would love to be able to join factions and work with other members to claim “faction workshops” or bases. If they could figure out a way to make them persistent that would be even better. Let other groups attempt to conquer them and fight to re-take control. Stuff like that 
---
at least with the TSE nerf they were manageable
---
now theres no defense againts them gg
---
I'm pissed about the Blackbird one.  I took a few days off from playing as I had family and work stuff burying me, and apparently I missed out on that with the one day sale.  That should NEVER happen.  That pisses me off more than anything else in the game, making something a 1 day available item should never happen just from business standpoint because they lost my purchase simply because I was unavailable.
---
Pacifist mode for the win.
---
I had one of you clowns punching me the other day. Easy enough to fast travel to a new location and block your whole squad.
---
I would say this is good to use it once. get me to the very next one at no cost, or the next further one along for the cost I usually aim for with my camp location and foot travelings - 7-12 caps.
---
It doesn't make sense to me to exist as an unlimited repeatable, just for the sake of there being a point to things like the travel agent card, traveling to camps, and 76's free travel point.
---
Just a line of the lyrics. ;)
---
You could try r/fo76filthycasuals
---
Yeah, it's the crashing that would terrify me the most.  The first time I lost a loot bag because the mobs were too tough to get through, I was sad and let down.  The first time I lost a loot bag because I was on my way back to it and the server crashed, I was fucking pissed OFF.
---
I am, however, very spoiled.  My lady and I play together, so those few times I wanted to transfer an item, it was a cinch :)
---
My issue with them is crappy loot. They are the premier enemy (other than SBQ) of the game. They should be dropping the best loot and we should WANT to hunt them down because of it!
---
Generally I built the first ring, then on top of that, built one block and the 2nd one is one level in (so one extra block per ring). I did build the stairs as I went though, just to make it easy to go up and down. 
---
Slow and steady wins the race, I'm now at nearly 20'000 Caps and 6000 Atoms by doing just that, playing the game, I may buy Speed Demon serum but mostly I use caps for fast travelling. 
---
In time the OP will be caps rich with nothing to spend them on.
---
All future content is free, all the new vaults opening, all new quests, etc will have no charge.  They've said that from the very beginning.
---
Blast time?
---
What secret passage? That door with the code is basically empty.
---
Saaaame here
---
Low HP isn’t a problem if you can one shot everything. The only way you can do damage i this game is with Bloodied and Adrenal + Nerd Rage
---
Same bug still.
---
I was determined to ride them from the world so they did not end up picking on someone less able.  Not really, it angered me that many would hit me at once and I just wanted to see them off.
---
Oouu that's really good. New Gad. My first long term camp was the other side of the water with purifiers in it.
---
You do get mutants attacking from up the hill and annoying mole rats but it's a decent spot. 
---
Exactly my thoughts! Vault 96 must have something to do with those vine growths. Also: "it fed on blood." I forgot about that. So maybe the "emanating" shrines near Vault 76 were "activated" by the blood of those fresh corpses! 
---
Hope you weren't trying to pay with pre war money!
---
*shrug* other games have recovered, and to be honest even with the duping issues most of that can and will be resolved in time, if by no other means than releasing new items and doing some better rebalancing.  
---
That said, the full PVP servers should be set up in a way I've not heard anyone talk about.   
---
-Should be a mandatory new character.  (Often mentioned)
---
-Should be similar level "locked" to a certain extend.  You should not have a level 300 on a server with 9 level
---
20's for example.   
---
-should have very limited and tightly tested legendary / non-standard items.
---
December 31st
---
Gotta look at the big picture... Melee have an advantage in damage output per hit... yes.  But a distinct advantage in all regards over ranged? No.  If a rifle can drop 2 shots off in the time it takes a melee to get in range and hit... I would expect that melee hit to do about twice the damage.  If you compare just bloodied weapons, a grognaks vs a lever or hunting rifle (highest slow hitters).   Give all things balanced (perks, health, mutations, etc), you're looking at 4-5 shots from the rifles to compensate for 1 melee swing.
---
This is mainly because melee ignores more armor than ranged does in addition to having higher base damage on weapons.
---
Balanced should mean, that it doesn't matter what spec you use, you'll all be doing comparable damage and kills.  Right now, that's just not the case in the game.
---
But, why not do both.  I have... I've got no problem shooting down scorch beasts and if they decide to land, they die pretty quickly.  But having done both, the damage on melee just far exceeds anything you can do with rifles now.
---
Maybe? But you have a lot of items... eventually i think you start to just build what's necessary other than what you can (ie how much water do you actually NEED? How many plants do you actually NEED?)
---
Love mine!  I'd buy more of the NC stuff if they offered it.
---
I am not in a hurry.
---
I am in a SLOWY. I am in THE slow.
---
I simply do not believe in speeding.
---
Or in the immortal words of baymax. I am Not Fast.
---
That's a Fallout original series reference. There was a guy selling 'iguana' meat that was not iguana meat...
---
*If* you really didn’t dupe stuff, that sucks. But I can’t imagine them banning someone permanently without some type of proof. For a game that’s not doing (assuming) as well as projected, they’re not about to start banning a bunch of people for no reason.
---
Get another account I guess?
---
I downloaded the demo! Did it release already??
---
Or better yet, what they are doing to fix it.   
---
Assurances are great, but give us a window into the process!
---
its one of the reasons why grinding isnt rewarding 
---
Yes. Good loot off the end game boss is very petty. What game does that!?
---
Yeah but unfortunately it requires windows 8 and it won’t let me go back to said software update. No matter what I try  
---
Can confirm. There's a swarm over the bridge that's just circling the area.
---
Next week
---
I refuse to throw anymore money then what I already have into this game 
---
Lone Wanderer now properly increases Loneliness.
---
It's all good and fun until I get 3-4 of my friends and we kill you with slap damage. Or you alt+f4
---
Still more common than fuel. Lasts decent as I usually use it for small critters that are hard to hit or target, or if I get boxed in and need a face melter.
---
10 hours a day divided by 440 levels is 0.022727 repeated (10 / 440 = 0.022727).  Meaning it took Glorf12 playing 1.36 minutes (0.022727 * 60 = 1.36 repeated) a day since launch to gain a lvl on average. At lvl 700, it would take 15.90 repeated hours (10 / 440 * 700) a day since launch for Glorf12 to be at that lvl given that all things are equal.  Doable I suppose, but unlikely.
---
Doughnut missiles fuelled by RadCoffee :)
---
I had that and haven't seen the friend since the week after launch. Drama kicked up in my life stopping me from playing that week and he hasn't been back since.
---
They thought they could get away with it. Now that the product failed profit wise and its controversal its the red headed step child.
---
Where's this town idea you're talking about? Sounds interesting
---
There is no life with Jet! 
---
I don't mind switching servers. Especially if it takes the fun out of the game for the teenie boppers.
---
PC was always the home of fallout ,so yes it would only thrive on pc
---
You are foolish if you think those 15 represent the real numbers, you are foolish if you even think the subscribers of this Reddit represent the real number of players
---
I also loved the Interloper chamber! I'm willing to bet they'll expand on it!
---
It's near there but hidden behind some vines, then theres a secret passage off that as well. Loads of lead veins in there. 
---
Yeah Rare really turned SoT around and their roadmap was awesome. I haven’t played in a bit, but they handled it how a studio should. 
---
You don’t think those 15 people actually bought atoms?
---
Nah, I'm an old man. It doesn't stop me. You think after you leave the server everyone else does too?
---
So instead of coming out and speaking to customers, there selecting certain customers call and explain things to??
---
Weren't prepared I could accept from some random indie company, but not from Bethesda.
---
If they've got information for you, then they should be sharing that info with the world / all customer's. (that's assuming it wasn't in response to a ticket you opened with them, which i'm assuming is what you've just said?).
---
If they don't have a direct line to the Dev team, then why are they still to this day cut and pasting the same shyte, "we'll pass this along", and if they don't whats the point of them from a customer point of view?
---
It really is irrelevant to the end user though how a company structures itself (usually to protect themselves as well btw). We / I purchased a product and its not fit for purpose, anything that excuses that is crazy. The customer deserves what they paid for or a refund, its not rocket science really. The promise of fixes coming and this and that are great but still 3 months from launch and they are still acting as if customers are the problem :(
---
Yes!
---
I uninstalled a little bit ago but I still pop by this sub, hoping to see something exciting enough to pick it back up... just crickets so far. I'm the only person in my friend group even still remotely interested.
---
Oh and how fast they fucking scream at you 
---
You sound salty. You mad?
---
Is star citizen a game that is available to be played? 
---
Did it leave the mythical crowd funded pre release incubation phase?
---
If you used *science* then this must be true and I'm going to build my own 'Cabinet Castle' as soon as I can log in again ;)
---
This picture makes me want an end-game event where players ride mothmen in to battle against scorch beasts.
---
My parents own a restaurant and I help out, so the only time I have is after 10 PM PST, and Sundays after church. It does feel empty at night, mostly cause everyone is asleep LOL. I usually log on for an hour or so, complete a couple quest, say hi to a stranger and log off. Sundays it's only around 2 PM PST and maybe 10 people in the world when I log in. 
---
&gt;server browser on it and let us host with mods.
---
thank call of duty and consoles  for starting the P2P cancer so that won't happen.....ever
---
i would pay 60$ for server browsers and server hosted mods
---
Don’t you love it when you miss 6 95% VATS shots back to back. 
---
I strongly disagree that harsh criticism is healthy. In no place outside of the internet would be it healthy or normal for someone to shame and exaggerate and profane another person or group for perceived failings (I'm not claiming you did all those things here, these are just things I see frequently in harsh criticism). I really believe this is just an example of people on the internet losing many of the social skills that are required in real life, and getting upset because they're so disconnected from the possible realities they want to happen. It's somewhat understandable, but IMO, not OK adult behaviour. Politeness and reason and specifics should always be a part of criticism IMO.
---
For your grammatical mistakes, I don't care at all man. I only brought them up as part of the back and forth that was going on, to show that I wasn't the only one being casual online. It doesn't make me think any less of you, your intelligence, or your education. 
---
In the end, I think this sub is getting worse every day. The hot topic area is filled with complaints and while some of them are great and helpful, a lot are just shit. Pure shit. xD  And I'm tired of it. This was supposed to be the balanced sub and it's becoming less so day by day. If this continues there will be no room for positive discourse here-- it'll just be a shitshow of insults, insinuations, and straight-up BS. Then all the people who are actually just little pissants trying to stir up trouble or kick the underdog will have a field day lol.
---
I hope it doesn't come to that. But I also understand that my sassing and arguing with people who are being negative or strongly critical doesn't help either. I'll try to scale it back some. ;)
---
Exactly. Plus it's on something like a 24 hour timer.
---
There is a shortcut to make them stop screeching in PC. 
---
Alt-F4  
---
i do this every time that happens and have zero regrets.
---
Not sure it works like that. Everybody has his own unique vendor list. Unless they changed it in the last patch i might be mistaken but if they didn't i'm 100% sure you can't see other people's generated vendor items, only the items people sell to vendors are universal.
---
What about them need fixing?
---
Nah, really don't care. I'm at work and bored. Can you send noods?
---
there was no economy in the first place tho,im curious what was the economy when caps are literally useless 
---
Yes, that could well be true! But again, these particular faces seem to be used very methodically to be simple asset recycling... 
---
Two shot effects vats negatively I think. The bullets hit each other and ricochet. Some guy made a good post about it on here.

---
Ask your mom......she already has some 
---
I'll check it out, I previously had the notion that gamers shouldn't support EA but BGS was a let down as well. In a few weeks we'll get news of how it's monetization is. 
---
Are train rides free where you live?
---
Personally I would just like to see the game as we have it now, fixed, I don't need anything to be made easier, or harder (as the last patch did), just fix what we have.
---
What about the cost of ammo?
---
&gt;not sure why anyone would downvote your post, i have also noticed the turrets dont seem to be much help
---
 because reddit.  i have only really become active on reddit since FO76 launched.  I have noticed that some people will downvote anything they even slighly disagree with - especially if it comes across as overt support or overt criticism of the game.  a post must remain absolutely neutral to avoid a down-vote.  fortunately, my self worth is no way affected by forum votes, karma points, or whatever form of validation the online world seems to crave.
---
I craft them at my chem bench with flux and they are usually overcharged. Usually 115% or thereabouts.

Yeah we had to pull her up from the coffin to get new nudes. Worth it.

No need to fire the contractor, just put them in the middle of Harper's Ferry with only a turret to protect them.

Road house
---
Your sister could describe it for you.
---
No. Yes.
---
I've heard that as well, but still haven't got to the Enclave questline yet. Do you know if you can trigger that independently or do you have to do the whole main quest progression first?
---
Sunk costs.
---
That money is gone, but my next dollar, well, lesson learned.
---
They spawn I  cranberry all the time on me
---
Had this same thing happen while taking over the ammunition factory a few days ago. Wasn’t worth it to try and take them out, so I left. Someone came in behind me to claim it and it spawned wolves for them...
---
Screws are super easy to horde later on.  I encourage you to trade for them instead of getting worked up at their difficulty to obtain.
---
I'm literally selling bulks screws springs gears etc at this point.  And constantly running out of lead / steel. 
---
So I'm level 133 now with a melee build. Someone a month or so ago just gifted me a handmade tse so I could manage scorchbeast attacks, so whatever.
---
Then I got a bloodied gatling gun to drop. HOLY CRAP. Put a prime receiver on it, manufactured about 1000 5 mm for it and literally ran around the map hunting scorchbeasts with it. REVENGE!!!
---
I'd be happy with just a portable stash I can drag around, independent from my static base.
---
I didn’t realize it when I happened. I’m still relatively new to the game. 
---
I camp equidistant between Top of the World and Sugar Grove and I regularly login to the familiar flapping of 3 SpamBeasts, no fissure near me but I seem to be on the ScorchBeast flight route, they often fly over the camp but just keep going.
---
Shotgun skills 3\* inc Enforcer 3\* and take them down and shoot their batty faces and profit with edible organs... Yum :))
---
The stupid thing is that they should leave after some time. Randomly encountering one in the wasteland makes sense otherwise how would the whole area have been wiped out, but like any animal, they should decide to leave after some time of you hiding behind cover. Itd also be great if they screamed less often.
---
What's wrong with charred ghouls tho?
---
Yes, under normal circumstances you should be able to trigger the quest twice per day (Per Server), but sometimes it only works once, so you have to server hop.
---
skip that quest until youre 50, the reward is a really nice super sledge, and its level maxes out at level 50. i am level 198 and i still carry that sledge and use it.. its a great melee weapon for someone that doesnt specialize in melee builds. i am a shotgun/sniper build, but carry the sledge for things dont wanna waste ammo on.
---
That;s what I said but no one at all is chiming in on this sentiment. I want regular modding in so we ourselves can help finish the areas of the game that just don't work like action bar customization/responsiveness, inventory UI, trading interface, perk card picking (option to store cards, picking resulting in having the higher level card without losing the low level), and  I want a sky is the limit creation club that would rival all the xperiences many have had with games completely focused on creator driven gameplay, the first of which were classic team fortress in the quake edit system and unreal tournament classic.
---
Junk weight perks?
---
hey there, I feel your frustration too :P but hey, today I've been allowed more luck with the power plants than you have, I have over 40 fusion cores now and I will gladly share 5 or 10 of them with you if you still want or need some :P
---
Yes same here.  In fact when I take a power plant workshop, I usually put a sign on the fusion core generator saying "Help Yourself" using the "small letters"
---
Sorry, I'm specifically talking about resource collectors in your own CAMP
---
Last night I was fighting a Colonel Gusty, and when I used vats my character warped into the floor and under the building. I couldn't move or swing my weapon, but you bet your ass the enemies could still shoot me. I died and my bag was unlootable because it was under the map 😂
---
LOL, that must have been it, the £1 notes and half crowns didn't go into the Fast Checkout slots.
---
The only thing you are awarded atoms for in game is completing challenges. Just because you don't look at the challenge menu and say "I'm going to do this challenge" doesn't mean you aren't completing challenges.
---
EXACTLY. this game will be so much better after its being played how we did gamespy server browse in the early days of modded online gaming
---
Used to play for 4-6 hours nightly. I've logged on like once in the last few weeks for literally less than 5 minutes to laugh at how bad my TSE Gauss is now and logged back off.
---
I’ve gotten in the habit of bulking junk I never use and selling it to vendors. Glass, rubber, cork, bone, stuff like that. Sometimes copper, aluminum, and gears too so I seem to always have 100+ for those.
---
Ore takes up a lot of my weight right now after I spent a couple weeks doing breach and clear any time it popped up. Just can’t find enough acid to smelt it all down. I think I have 260 lead ore right now that I can’t smelt lol I think I have a problem 
---
I hate this sub. I haven't posted anything for months because literally every time I post anything there is always one person (not referring to you specifically) that freaks out on me for one reason or another and it is just exhausting. Plus I have horrible social anxiety so even talking to people on the internet is tough. But yeah I think your analysis of peoples communication on the internet is fair. 
---
Well, to be honest normally I'm all for a little sarcasm. But today was a really bad day in the game and feels like it gets worse day after day instead of better. 
---
The whole game. 
---
You probably missed the drill, syringer, or flare gun. they are on the legendary loot pool.
---
i find that placing Dummy targets in the way of enemy spawns helps the turrets do their jobs. Example, i have cardboard standees placed where most enemies will be, they hit the standees and inturn the turrets wake up (most of the time)
---
I thought mass went under Aid, I don't have any aid weight perks. 
---
Like Donkey from Shrek donkey balls, or Jaun Valdez's donkey donkey balls?
---
Are they human or ghouls?
---
I think thru hiker reduces glowing mass.
---
Yeah that’s what happened. I hopped on and didn’t think to server hop. 
---
Lol yeah that applies here
---
I love these posts that are shown in the Hot tab that default comes up because they are just intricate conversations between us like what we would be doing in the actual game if there was any way to do so.
---
I would love a T.O.W.N it would be a killer feature 
---
Right up the road from Torrence Manor, there is also Overlook Cabin. When I first found these locations I began wondering if the Dirty Pillows I constantly find in containers are also a Stephen King reference. 
---
Nah I get where you are coming from completely.  Honestly I have always felt griefing folks was silly and a waste of time but any game with a multiplayer component has the same issue and often in similar ways :-p  I just like to share with people what I know or learn so that as it becomes more commonly known it gets fixed or people find new ways to defend against it.  Overly Generous versus a rad suit is funny because it frustrates the hell out of them.
---
Option 2.
---
Just logically speaking, doesn't make much sense why this piece of leather can do X, Y, and Z where as the **power armor torso** only has stats. Why should this piece of armor be excluding from being legendary? There's just no real reason for power armor to be excluded from being legendary. Now, if you want to balance it you could do something like legendary power armor pieces only get 1 star. Maybe I'm just salty from all the legendary wood pieces I've gotten over time haha.
---
When it comes to two shot weapons, you're firing two of the same type of bullets from the same gun and the 2nd bullet does less damage? Just doesn't make a lot of sense. If the real reason for the nerf is that pvp people were complaining that it was too over-powered, then why should the pve people suffer? I feel that a better way to balance TSE weapons is to have them do less damage to players; especially since every enemy in the game is a bullet sponge (which makes ranged weapons way worse than melee). 
---
You're right; heavy weapons were already in a bad place before the TSE nerf and now they're even worse, especially explosive heavy weapons. Heavy weapons just need re-balancing in general.
---
They nerfed crit chaining. the nerf no one asked for or complained for.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alfovd/the_unsung_nerf_to_vats_criticals/
---
I get so frustrated with the small letters sometimes, they like to mess up placing themselves behind or inside of the walls I'm placing them on. I need to get a plan for the neon ones.
---
But. But, I must have **every plan and mod in the game**!
---
(I think it's a symptom of not being allowed to collect anything else in game)
---
\*Repurposed quotes\* 
---
The wise Mothman is quite specific on the topic of murder. He is a bit fuzzier on the topic of kneecaps.
---
Or 2 caps and a piece of chalk
---
Helped kill the SBQ today. Got 5 Harpoons... Not a Ledgendary I know but I feel you
---
It’s hard because your running around naked and you probably have a hidden necrophilia complex, otherwise it wouldn’t be.
---
It's possible, but usually the Legendary item spawns at the top of the loot box. In the instances I've seen this occur the top spot was caps or similar.
---
It was some stuff not on my camp. My building was there so I didn’t need to rebuild it all. I didn’t realize it until I jumped on today. I like my spot so I don’t move a lot. 
---
This shit happened to me last night.  I just gave Rosie the tape for the scorched detector and I'm headung for the bunker when I hear the wings.
---
I crouch and see caution.  I got armor on that makes me invis if I don't move.  I hug a tree and wait.  The wing noise stops but the screen says caution.
---
I peek out and the fucking beast is standing behind my tree waiting.
---
I book it.  The prick follows me to the eat and run shack where I try hiding again and after a few minutes the wing noise stops and I go from danger to caution.  I heal up and head out.
---
The fucker is outside waiting again.  It chases me from there to the ghoul infested hobo town in the swamp where I hide.
---
Drops from danger to caution so I heal and go.
---
Fucker was waiting again.  It chases me until I reach Abbie's bunker when I say fuck it and just fast travel to the Armory.  Costs less than all the stimpaks I blew running.
---
TL;DR: Scorchbeast chased me from Top of the World to Abbie's bunker making me use up all my stimpaks.
---
Oh wow, that's nifty as shit. I'd be psyched if something like that was added. Thanks for sharing those with me
---
We really do need everyone who actually has good intentions for the game to come together. I hope everyone can chill out, and that Bethesda can release some quality updates so that the actual trolls won't have a weapon to tilt the rest of us with. :P
---
I hope you get some good sleep when it comes!
---
White Knight makes repairs cheaper fix it good makes repairs over 100%
---
Chems dont stack, only different things such as a chem and liquor or food
---
So generally sardonic and bitchy, assuming the worst out of everyone and generally not being disappointed because starting from a caustic and overtly hostile place creates a self-fulfilling cycle of disappointment and nihilism?   
---
Whats the problem? I go full melee with Basic handmade for shooting them in air and i can také Care of them and you all shooting stars cant? Some thing is bad with players not mobs 🤔
---
That are looking into laser guns last I seen, if that's what you're referring to. I'm not convinced they will go about it in a good way, but at least it's something. 
---
Still playing. As I never bought a TSE laser Gatling from a duper, the TSE nerf didn’t affect me at all. 
---
It’s never bothered me. I don’t play for loots. I play for fun.
---
omg yes. Teddy bear display case please!
---
Got a sack of 5,000 caps with your name on it. In-game name is Thaang
---
I actually don't know what's worse.  Not getting Legendary loot, or getting a Legendary 40 levels below you off a top-level enemy.
---
I'm still playing it, but I AM going to complain the whole time. 
---
Yeah, they had a platonic relationship for years then one day we came home and saw them sharing a double sided dildo. Looked like cat dog.
---
Yep, One of the reasons I quit.
---
I haven’t experimented with it myself but OP seems to have done quite a bit of research. Turrets and such seem to line up for my experiences. 
---
I guess you not, Rockstar adds new content all the time and has yet to cost me cent. Sure there are going to be people that pay and I thank them for that, but they will never get an extra cent out of me .. people who do pay are part of the issue, I am not saying people shouldn't buy they not helping either. As developers who used to provide full games are on the microtransaction bandwagon so they can make more money. There is no reason not to provide a full game for $60 and yet we barely even got that.
---
Uhh... I carry 50,000 shots and they way nothing...
---
get ready for f2p yall ;)
---
Dense armor baby!! That shit does nothing!
---
We live in a post-apocalyptic world. I'm not really for this idea as is.
---
However, I wouldn't be against this if there was a world-based co-operative event or series of events that benefitted all people on the server. Something like the pre-nerf Mama Dolce quest, which felt good to do because you knew that it helped everyone.
---
For instance, maybe you need to firstly fire up one of the power plants to get power to the rail line and then follow up with some other varied group of quests to help get the trains working e.g. maybe there's a rare component you need to fix the train at one of the train yards, or there's a pack of deathclaws blocking the line etc. Maybe have several secondary quests like this to keep it interesting but keep the overall quest chain to 2 or 3.
---
Once the quests are completed, the train line is active for free fast travel down the line until a day or whatever feels right, at which point something breaks down and needs fixing once again.
---
Thought they would use wilderness or some red marked area not whole map...loved RuneScape,Nw....
---
I don't think I'll ever buy atoms, because the amount of atoms is inflated, there is an arbitrary zero that exists solely to make atoms seem equal to a dollar. 
---
How much for the axe
---
Unload your perk cards to find out 
---
ahh ok, they must have fixed whatever was wrong with my game cause today I got the rank 3 lockpick, actually found a schematic, pretty cool :3
---
I do not think any of the current numbers in either this poll or the Reddit are close to the truth
---
I know but I remember this really taking the enjoyment out of exploring that area when all that would happen is I would get aggroed by them constantly 
---
If they did 5 dollar theme building packages like 4 did/does id own them all. But the current selection feels like most of it should have came with the game considering i can only build on a 3x5x3 and barely have a chance at filling it. Though i have already paid for some of it when i purchased fallout 4 and they skinned it on over to here. 
---
 Today is an 8 dollar suit. Which is just a reskin of the 14 dollar festivus suit. Though it adds a shorts combination. If the they just flatlined everything to 500 atoms and gave us double the atoms from dollar purchases I think they would see people spending 20-40 a month on junk they don't want.  Instead this rollercoaster of prices is killing it. 10 dollars for a fucking workstation but 5 dollars for a bed? Wheres the fucking value difference. Both are just reskinned things already in thee damn game. Hell at that level of effort i can just extract a model slap on my favorite band album and replace the file for my own personal viewing pleasure. 0 dollars. 
---
i have bought $20 worth to get a power armor Skin and another $20 to get the red rocket sign. i feel 100% that the skins are WAY to overpriced and have sines stopped wanting to spend real money. The Rust item store is a great example to go by. back when skins cost $5-25/ea for just a weapon or PIECE of armor, not even full set. they sold ok but just hardcore fans really. then they reduced it to $0.99-5/ea and they sell so much more. ONE skin that was $1.49 for rust this last week has made well over $40,000 BEFORE the split between Rust/artist/steam. if beth just halved their prices they would see a much better rate of purchases, and a community market such as steam has for games like Rust, CS, PUBG etc would help as well. but yea...doubt we will see this happen.
---
don't think that will work but appreciate the effort.
---
Not sure but I know I have max card for better buying/selling prices and the mentents for better prices don't change the prices
---
I fought one just one in cranbury bog and 8 stim packs and 20 mins later it never landed i was level 75 at the time but i was a melee build with only a dragon to use on it for ranged. I could not even line up a shot because it spammed sonic blasts even when it was flying away from me it was shooting them out of its ass lol. I gave up and left. I could kill it in 7 or 8 hits if it would have landed. I thought they were supposed to have made it where they land more often but i guess i would have better luck getting a canvas bag before that would happen lol.
---
New features and fixes are like a monkey paw at this point.
---
* No scrapping mods, but bulk is scrapped 
---
* Trade limit raised to 25000, but the slider won't stop at 0.
---
* SBQ doesn't disappear, but now it's a meat pile in seconds.  
---
* 2SE has been nerfed, but it now affects standard explosive weapons.
---
* All plans are now available instead of server hopping for hours, prices raised tenfold.
---
Got to laugh though 😂
---
Can't they be the same thing?
---
I love finding a Legendary 3\* wondering if it will drop something amazing.
---
Getting a new gun to mod out and try, or a piece of armor that really completes a set. 
---
Usually its a wood leg or pool cue or something, which I can accept and move on. But nothing? It just pulls the rug out from under you.
---
Just a faded visor, amusement park uniform, and a candy cane.
---
It seems like its become almost impossible to kill the Queen (which is the only end-game fight available) with the new update. Usually, I would surf the Xbox Looking For Group menu for a server to join to kill the queen. These days its too hard to try for a public group because most players are under-geared for the fight.
---
Yup. I was getting murdered by the overgrown fly rats after the explosive nerf. Then after messing with some new perks fireproof did the trick. All rats gotta die, even master splinter. Lol
---
Truhiker? I would be surprised if you didn't have this and had a lot of food
---
That’s why I’ve seen so many flare guns on legendaries! Ugh 
---
I like to pop my low charge fusion cores into unclaimed power armor frames and drop them off at train stations for people to find / take /use...
---
Use your pipboy light
---
Ok, so that would be a whole new build then, since I don't think I have any single duplicate rifleman cards, and (as far as I know) you can't break combined cards apart. I might have 1x Tormentor, but I don't think I have seen either of the other two perk cards drop for me yet.
---
I had another look at my hunting rifle and it's only 139 damage now... it \*was\* 209, so I don't know what is going on there.
---
Recently, I have been using my lever rifle more for hip-fire, but I still have a longer barrel on it.  My hunting rifle is set up for primarily sighted use.
---
Santa Beard, Sunglasses, Santa Hat and Vault Tec Pijamas. I love the Sunglasses, because the pipboy light makes em glow as the XO1 eyes do.
---
Got a scorchbeast for the workshop defend event in Buckly (and also right after I'd built a fusion generator). I seriously had not seen that before.   
---
You just get screwed no matter what. I relogged and just ate the extra resources I'd spent trying to setup that generator and some actual decent defenses. But even if I had stayed and fought, it would just be a huge waste of ammo and stims, and probably mediocre loot at best.
---
And Todd Howard said this would be a softcore survival game. Tell that to all our fallen brothers and sisters that could no longer bear playing the game.
---
They would have told us last week if it wasn't all about the hot fix.  If they actually succeeded in a proper deployment, what would have been?
---
The non-stop spam attack is horrible.  What's worse is that you can't take shelter from it.  In a building?  So what!  Behind a huge tree?  nah.  Concrete overpass?  please...  
---
I keep them all in the hopes we get player vending.   Somebody will buy it for more than the 6 caps a bot gives me.
---
I have heard some players say that certain mods are arbitrarily not available through scrapping.
---
I do feel like there's something going on that might penalize a player who scraps too many of the same part too quickly.
---
once for the xmas t-51b skin 
---
Worse than that a 3 star super mutant taking half your bullet supply then you get an nocturnal golf club one star 
---
I like getting legendaries.
---
But if a legendary creature doesn’t drop one, I don’t make a Reddit post about it.
---
The thing about video games is there will be another legendary and another chance to get something good.
---
Video games never run out.
---
Did you try scrapping it?
---
This post is 3 months old bro lol
---
dude I know you think I would be complaining if I didn’t do that shit, I search every body, box, canister, fucking dishwasher for christ’s sake I take everything I can find that benefits my health in the slightest even those god forsaken bees.
---
I really pity the console players who can't use the Perk Loadout Manager mod. Once I threw that on, the game simply isn't playable for me without it. If we must abide perk cards, being able to quickly switch between card groups is a must.
---
You're making the assumption that they had the original in mind and made an End Boss in homage, rather than realised their End Boss was similar, and so stuck a reference to it in there.  
---
I find the latter more likely.
---
Bingo. Let's show em what they won bob.
---
2 weeks ago I had like 25 active people on my friends list yesterday I log on and its a ghost town everybody I knew that played this game religiously since launch has dipped
---
Personally I don't see much wrong in complaining about a game that you don't enjoy. And if I want to know if the game is getting better, a good way to check that is to see if there are more or less complaining posts on this subreddit after a new patch. So I don't think your post is good advice. Also it's kinda condescending. 
---
It’s about every two weeks. That’s pretty fast for s game like this.
---
If it was every week, people would be upset about that.
---
I mean, yes.  I wholeheartedly agree.  All we're saying is that, if you *did* want to sell these things in the Atom Shop, there's probably more interest in those than a tacky pink suit.
---
They may not represent the player base in percentage terms, but there is no reason to think those 15 individuals were lying.
---
And also seriously heavy drinking, and really really really angry.
---
Yes, I have 3 locations I pick them up from regularly (not as reliable post-patch) so I usually place 1 in my stash, when I find it, then go looking for more, having a team mate along with you will allow you to Free travel back to your camp to get another one, and then back to them at Venture.
---
I did this with someone else while we emptied a bunch from our stash boxes one day, you can get Good Plans, rare BOS Outfits, &amp; Underarmors, and the occasional Legendary item (mostly Combat Armor). 
---
Even the one that used campfires to create unbreakable bases using foundations.
---
Yet the auto dupe of the camo items was an exploit.  No, that's a bug in your code.
---
Hmm. I have definitely noticed grape mentats giving me better prices at vendors it is seems to stack with Hard Bargin perk.
---
They're my wife's initials, so first we though the game had read her social media and placed those there.    
---
Still waiting for this to be cleared up.
---
It's the core mechanic of this game. Grind for resources and caps, and then blow them on RNG stuff that might just give you nothing.
---
Tattered dress and Marine helmet it's very bdsm looking
---
Devs: New content?  The bugs give you a new experience each time, that's new content right there!
---
Thanks.
---
The only thing that went wrong when I was in for a Nuke Launch was that the part where you had to fix the steam lines wouldn't reset due to a fail, we just went to a different silo and one player stayed and finally launched from that site.
---
300+ hours and still playing
---
Happened to me other night.   Made me logged off out of frustration since i could not access my base.  A few days later when i decided to play again, and it was fixed.
---
Blue prints are for small items/buildings only. Like if you have a small, separate outbuilding you want to transfer with your camp.
---
Otherwise, just move your camp somewhere, and your main foundation/camp will be in your stored items. You can just place it at the new location, or leave it as stored.
---
Would anyone know the damage bonus spot for scorchbeasts? 
---
We all know you can cripple the wings to force it to land, but I am wondering where to shoot for the damage bonus. I've been going for the head, but that is not always the case for all enemies.
---
I've not noticed much of a difference at all. Seems much like it use to me. 
---
The only instance I've heard that there is a lot less people are people's accounts of their friend list diminishing to nothing.
---
As for the side thing, it's definitely important to have the single player stuff but they also do need some multiplayer stuff too. People have been asking for both PvP and co-op type content so there is a demand out there for it. Personally, I wouldn't mind a ratio of like 80-20 single player vs multiplayer.
---
You can have multiple blue prints, so blue print the base etc then start a new blue print for everything in the base or the walls etc
---
Then when placing its blue print 1 blueprint 2 and so on.
---
It doesn't help that the max level on them is like Level 15...
---
Its an art deco style recycycled asset, yall make up anything for a creepy youtube vid or to praise bethesda these days.
---
Not exactly..   
---
Short of long, I submitted about 35 support tickets in 5 hours, none of them duplicates, all of them in direct response to a post I had up in this sub where the resulting conversation with a community manager was "submit a ticket".  
---
I didn't spam them, but I did bombard them with information, and I did it through the incorrect channel, deliberately incorrect, so I'd get a ticket number for each submission. (Submitting reports to the Dev's via their page does not net a ticket # and clearly states you'll never see a response).  
---
The call, as I said, was to discuss the process and try and hammer out a way, if I was going to continue bombarding them with data, to submit them in a way they could handle, and to the correct place (Dev channel directly vs "support") in an effective and manageable way.  
---
In short I became a problem and they needed to figure out if I was going "to play nice" and follow the procedure once clarified, or likely (though not said) block me ;).  
---
As for the directly line, turns out they are using a ticketing system, as most medium to large companies do, which results in data being sent to the Dev's.  
---
This is different from what we'd expect.. Dropping a note off at their desk, shooting an email over, or walking over and having a face to face with them.  
---
Not sure I fully agree with the last part, can you give me an example of how they are treating us / acting like we are the problem?
---
I would love to see more along the lines of the Lucky Hole Mine and that Locked building next to that giant tree in the Mire.
---
If I had 3 points it would probably be the same for me, only time I heal from scorchbeast queen is from add damage 
---
That's not exactly what I am talking about though.
---
I got the critical meter filled in this example after every shot. Most of the times at least two times with a six shooter magazine. And the game tells me the critical gets executed after I triggered it, it is a message in the left upper screen. But the enemy doesn't get the damage.
---

---
Devs list of fixes needed = The Game :/
---
Gay 
---
Both of those were a given, didn't think they needed to be said, my bad.  
---
And good on you for owning it ;)
---
Not as far as I know 
---
I make lowest lv possible and unlock the mods pretty quick
---
Even if it does it's not enough for the extra mats it costs to make higher lv stuff imo
---
Man that is totally harsh and not at all amusing like my bug.
---
I did eventually. I could scrpa it, or move it or whatever like every other normal turret. It was just very angry about it shooting at me even when I had it in the build menu.
---
I’m talking ab the Railway rifle
---
I personally go and kill sentry bots when I need cores. 
---
yesterday after getting to the uranium fever quest with 2 minutes left I exited the mine to find 2 scorchbeasts, no prob, used my plasgat to kill one and get the other to half health, by this point another had showed up, also no prob, I had my daisycutter and that special super sledge, killed one and waited patiently for the other to land... and waited... and gave up cause heck that. bethesda pls make plasgats a bit less pointless pls, there legit arent enough workbenches out there to sustain my poor choice of awesome weaponry.
---
The pony might be some assembly required.  Warning in advance 
---
He finds you.
---
They don’t benefit from the rifleman perks, it bugged
---
Ida just scrapped it and been on my way
---
But but its all your fault!! Don't you feel bads
---
Another reddit user created a map
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9vxi2c/grahms\_route\_now\_with\_20\_more\_pixels\_and\_half\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9vxi2c/grahms_route_now_with_20_more_pixels_and_half_the/)
---
I have seen him 2x since the Beta - by the Son of Dane's compound area and Lewisburg station and that was a while ago.
---
That happened to me. Store it and put it back down. Will be fixed. 
---
Some people have argued he likes to spawn on either end of the map and follow the roads through workshops. I've spotted him a few times coming from the amusement park through hemlock holes up north.
---
I've also seen him a few times at Grafton steel. 
---
Once I have seen him go through whitesprings.
---
Anything at Watoga would aggro him, so he probably avoids it.
---
Na, you can find a fully assembled one at whitespring and the industrial farm
---
Did not spent any money either. But to be honest I may would buy something useful. Like a special hat with +2AG or any perk I could need =) 
---
Shame on me but I would if it would be something which adds to my current layer. So would only buy when it has stats or some kind of use...
---
Yes. People should upvote one of the existing posts about the stash limit instead of spamming.
---
It goes back and forth. Steel quickly becomes the bottleneck because you often need 2x or more steel to lead for most recipes. 
---
There are a couple of farming runs that will give you enough lead and iron ore in a matter of minutes to craft thousands of rounds, but you'll quickly run out of acid to smelt it, and probably gunpowder too, (even if you currently have tons of it). I still scrap like every gun and random found steel item in the game to supplement because of the acid bottleneck. 
---
Map is wrong, the 4 times I've found him wer enot on his "route" as the map shows
---
It's the type of issue where the problem is between the chair and the keyboard/controller.
---
But....  Outer Worlds isn't out yet....  This was the game I was supposed to have tide me over until then... not vice versa....
---
It's definitely the dwemer...I always wondered where they went after their disappearance from Tamriel
---
Honestly, I just built my house in a place where nothing can spawn, and don't bother with turrets unless it's a workshop, at which point I build as many rocket turrets as I can (if I care to lock stuff)
---
Im the type of guy who complains to get trough to the devs. I love Fallout and want 76 to be successfull. Its just the lack of content that makes it boring sometines. I still play daily and enjoy just killing enemies and wandering around taking pictures. 
---
I got upset when we got a couple not needed nerfs ( white knight, demolition expert) but I have persevered. I been playing since launch and I still really enjoy the game more than not. I can be easily entertained in a big sandbox like this, but I understand that most players need more content to come out quicker for them . I'll be here in West Virginia, killing scorched scum of any variety, and those filthy ghouls too. 
---
You wanna see my downstairs mixup? 
---
For instance when selling the Straight Jacket I got it to 50 caps with Hard Bargain 3 and Charisma 11. With more pieces of Unyielding I don't think I could get it higher than 50. SO I think there is some kind of cap at a percentage of how much you an get or save.
---
&gt; The TSE nerf drove away a lot of players
---
at least the crybabies are satisfied,now they can no longer can complain that people are one shotting  legendary mobs (cause there is no one playing anymore) yay
---
I seen him right outside watoga at that run down train yard to the west. Just strolling through white spring. And my big bend tunnel.
---
Opens vault.  It’s the one interior location that you can leave the game and will spawn back into.  Fast travel is disabled in there for some reason.
---
Closes vault in hot fix.  Entire player base stuck in vault.
---
I feel like they are just using the Skyrim dragon AI. Fly around forever, shoot some fire at you, get distracted by some other NPC after you took its life to 10%, and land rarely.
---
currently the only thing that should be stopping you from taking anything out of your stash is if you are 1500 over your carry capacity. say you can carry 250 if you are carrying 1750 you cant pick up anymore.
---
A lot of people don't know those existed.
---
I have met wise (red eye) in the forest and vengeful (yellow eye) in the way to ammo factory...the vengeful soaked up all my resources and kept coming.

---
I feel your pain, i lost everything because these two scorchbeasts kept following me and just flying around and screeching, they never landed or did anyother attack
---
Doesn’t matter you can buy like 6 plans with a full inventory of caps with these rates now.
---
Where’d you get those? All I have is brown.
---
I'm gonna laugh when Obsidian announces a survival multiplayer game and pokes fun of beth in the trailer.
---
You can see the hate on this sub, the facebook page and twitter yes? Do you think an open line or some sort of regular communication about what they are doing to put it right would be the correct way to go?
---
Or go to 1 communication a week in the form of an empty and vague ITV article?
---
The way I see that is they are ignoring there customers, they haven't taken ownership publicly that they messed up and the game is a broken mess. They seem to be ignoring the fact that if you purchase a product it should be fit for purpose / work as intended.
---
the silence is deafening and it makes it look more and more like a cash grab and hide behind ToS bs but hey maybe hiding away behind useless CM's is the best way to fix it and get the community back on side :/
---
Let screws be something you can craft from steel, hell even have different metals do different types, and then those types are used in different things. 
---
So black titanium screws are used in PA, whereas copper in electrics, aluminium armour and steel in guns. 
---
Springs too while we are at it. 
---
Sack hood and Ritual Bindings they just go together.
---
I tried to that map for 30 minutes and no luck. Feel like I'll find him once I spend all my caps one day 
---
Had a leave 48 guy send a team invite while I was waiting to enter a blast zone so i took it in the event I got disconnected. He wanted to sell like 700 .38 rounds and some water for 500 caps because he was broke. Worst part he didn't have a mic so he was text chatting. Left team
---
True 
---
Only by bug. It has happened that people have taken zero damage while everyone else died but it was due to some bug or another. No working in game features will allow you to survive it.
---
Same. I've found a couple lying on tables here and there, but every single generator I've come across is empty.
---
Also it takes time to write up patch notes and inside the vault articles. If more frequent updates are at the cost of these posts, I'd rather keep it as is.
---
Better that I know what the changes are and why then frequent updates I don't know about changing the underlying mechanics. We've already been through that with quiet nerfs in past patch releases.
---
The face on Whitespring (and F4) really look like something out of Skyrim!
---
Disastrous patch plus Apex Legends drop = a lot less people playing
---
They are all f’ed up. 
---
I hope you didn't actually buy Atoms for that.
---
Speak for yourself, man. If you waste 150 flux due to lack of planning whose problem is that? That's a you problem.
---
They don’t even do that much damage. It’s the constant screen shake and special effects that prevent me from shooting them. Especially while they fly around and refuse to land. 
---
He could have bought it and traded it to the person.
---
Thanks. And yeah both of those were a given, but I needed to own them. I don't get many chances.
---
I see.  Guess I’m always late to the party but now I’m interested in this bloodied built you speak of.  
---
I sincerely want this game to succeed. The only thing i do rn is wandering around killing enemies and taking nice pictures for my Wasteland album.
---
Its fun but i cant play for hours on end. 
---
Agreed. There’s a whole list of things they have to do each and every time they do an update. 
---
Going from every two weeks to every week doubles all that work.
---
There’s really no reason to create a lot of extra work. 
---
Hey hey at least you didn’t get just 1, they gave ya FIVE
---
I usually go play World of Warships when not in the mood for Fallout 4 or 76, but they recently lit the game on fire with a terrible patch. I dunno what to try next :/
---
I've bought 9000 atoms. I've also played 76 for over 850 hours. I haven't bought atoms since patch 4 when I was still hopeful that they cared. I won't be buying more. I don't feel bad for spending that money and I sure did get my value for money regarding time spent playing. 
---
I never liked having multiple chars. I enjoy leveling up my main and try to learn and find everything i can. 
---
I still one shot legendary enemies... just use a grognaks now instead of a TSE.  War... War Never Changes.
---
Where did you go?
---
Forgive the stupid question, but how are you guys moving items across characters? Are you just getting a friend to hold items while you log out and switch?
---
he's prolly under lvl 50, also stop flexing no one cares
---
I’ve seen him in whitesprings a few times just wandering through slaughtering ghouls and death claws 
---
Last patch put in a hard 1500 personal weight limit to discourage dupers. If you're over it, you can't do anything until you unencumber yourself.
---
And yet here you are
---
I dunno. But in game me and friends have done things we just won’t eat, radroach, bloatfly. 
---
I won’t wear iguana on a stick. Rumor has it’s human. 
---
I currently have 3600 Atoms, and recently surpassed 76 hours of play time.  I got 500 Atoms with the download card that came with my game, and another 500 Atoms from the Power Armor Canvas Bag Debacle.  So in 76 hours of play, I've earner about 2600 Atoms, which comes to almost 35 Atoms per hour of play.
---
I specialize in melee..I've really yet to find another "all around basher" 
---
Think you're just backasswards man
---
Super mutants are the things that fuck me up the most besides scorch beasts
---
Get phrma farma for better meds in containers
---
Try killing things from a longer distance or pulling a few enemies away from the group, don't run into the middle of a shit ton of them and wonder why you're dying
---
Get better armor
---
Get the bloodied mutation (forgot what it's called) 
---
Fight enemies closer to your lv
---
When in doubt use power armor
---
Funny thing is I was in 100% denial that I had any problems at all until I saw that show and that character. Kinda scared the crap out of me and flipped my world upside down for a second.
---
There’s a spawn right over the hill from the whitespring. To the east of the station. It’s not a fissure site it’s just a hole in the ground schortbeast come out of. And occasionally it will aggro the groundskeepers and mayhem ensues
---
I have so many super stim packs and regular stim packs that it's trivial to just keep juicing after every attack.  For me the bigger issue is that you can't see the damn things in the sea of sonic screech spam, and if you can't see them you can't really shoot them.  I'm not melee, but I might as well be when I have to wait for them to land to be able to start attacking them again.
---
I would rather get a perk point.
---
Shoot their eyes. Often the legs block the thruster. And the eyes have very little health. 
---
You should also be able to sell duplicate plans, recipes, and ammo.  
---
I've got like 8 or 9 dupe perk cards, this would be awesome
---
Lost 2 good melee weapons to the same glitch in just a few days... 
---
Thanks....I don't follow the news enough lol
---
Same.
---
reee muh 20 caps to reeee
---
I must be super unlucky in finding him. 
---
If you are one hitting what risk is there, as someone mentioned earlier right build and perks you basically have no risk. Vamp,bloodied, unyielding, healing, scaly, and others it become less risk.
---
Does armorer reduce amount of material need to make repairs?
---
Yeah I had no luck with that map either, but I its not like a followed the entire route.
---
I mean I get it, but it’s rebuilding America, let us fucking put our camp next to our friends so we can have massive compounds? Or is that to much to ask
---
Very interesting. Do items snap to place nicely or no? If I blueprinted just the base like you said, then made a separate blueprint for all my turrets and workbenches, would they snap into place nicely on each floor or do I have to place them individually?
---
If they raised the level cap this would be nice
---
I like to dump unwanted stuff into trash bins at train stations and hope someone finds it. Apparently I'm not the only one because yesterday I found about a dozen legendary weapons in a mailbox in front of Whitesprings station that I assume someone wasn't able to vendor.
---
It would probably get people to buy more Atoms if they advertise a gotta have item.  But how are they going to get the word out?  Flood Twitter?  People will complain.  Send emails?  People will unsubscribe complaining of spam.  Notify in game ahead of time?  Still means you'll have to log in at the right point.  How does ESO spread the word?
---
I just noticed today that Nuka cups are scrapping for cloth now, no longer plastic. You know cause cups are cloth and shit, only the stacks of cups yield plastic when scrapped. I’ve been all over the place and noticed I have 2k plus heavy ass bulk cloth for some reason and much less plastic. 
---
Bunch of ass clowns. 
---
In a franchise, where players are used to single player and mostly disliking pvp, balance changes are near impossible. 
---
The map was meant to tackle possible routes, it was not 100% definitive..
---
I agree this would save me the trouble of doing vendor runs. 
---
Pacifist mode already extends to camps. I think what you mean is "Pacifist mode should make it so other players can't damage the pacifist's camp unless the pacifist becomes wanted."
---
It should work yes....it is Bethesda though :/
---
I’m not sure how people are going to have the gut to tell you that you leveled up too fast lol... I’ve had the game since day one and completed every bit of content after a week of no lifing it. At no point during the story missions or side quests did I feel entertained or anything. The quests were generally all the exact same, either go to a terminal or kill something. Any objectives throughout the quests were very very basic and nothing in the game feels seems unique to other games. I’m hoping they do a complete revamp of it much like No Man’s Sky did because Bethesda can do way better if they even put for a bit of effort to fix the lack of content
---
So buy the stempack recipe cost like 1 blood sack a couple steel and something else not rare and get the chemist card to double the amount of chems made
---
Also get the mutation for 200% health regen also life giver perk 
---
Mother of god.
---
I’ve been trying to get the witches dress for a while now I’ve had her spawn twice without it. I’ve basically given up on it. 
---
I wear wetsuit mask and civil war dress with the  prison collar
---
Oh boy can't wait for more passive aggressive  crybabies wishing for attention on Reddit! That's this post.
---
I wish I could have that on mine.  I'm not sure I've ever come across Dense, period, and it's supposedly one of the mods which is arbitrarily unobtainable through scrapping.
---
Vendors don't seem to carry it either, if we're seeing the full list these days.  I guess I shouldn't complain though, since I did get all the BoS plans from Grafton before Patch 5.
---
f ff
---
Screw whoever made the skyrim dragons\*
---
A WHAT CAMP
---
Ive used a few with Max hard bargain and nothing changed
---
I'll test it later and find out for sure
---
What system do you play on
---
EEEAAAAAHHHHHHH
---
Releasing the game in this state with a perfectly functional Atom shop at those prices should tell you everything you need to know about Bethesda's long-term plan for this game.
---
Don't bother giving advice here.   This sub just wants to complain about non problems lol
---
In sure they have enough people within the span of 3 studios to aid further development of FO76 without the need to delay future projects. 
---
That's a Bethesda Lighthouse, working as intended ;)
---
Dude ESVI is already gonna be dropping in like 2024 at this point, no delays necessary just make the fixes.
---
That mission froze up on me 3 times. I feel your pain. On the flip side the glassed cavern was the first place I killed a SB solo. 
---
I bought a second account for $20. They are cheaper now. You can run 2 instances of the game on one pc. I had my main account carry my new PVP alt around to every queen kill and a dabbled in whitesprings nukes post XP nerf. Took me about a week to get to level 50 and I can now launch 6 nukes in a row since I have the 2nd character. 
---
I did this all with other friends who supplied me with low level gear. The hardest part is dealing the 5% damage you need for XP. In a group you will always get the loot, but if you don't damage the enemy then you won't get the XP. It took me until about level 15 to get a good enough weapon to deal real damage.
---
Absolutely they should, doesn't matter if its different teams etc. 
---
The team from FO76 should be out the door by now anyways. 
---
Get these other teams working on it and fixed for your existing customers before trying to take more money of people for the next broken buggy product.
---
They wont though, they've probably still got the same bunch of monkeys working on it now that couldn't handle it at launch so not sure what they are expected to have learnt with the 5 pitiful patches / attempts at fixing a few basic things.
---
Yeah I hit level 100 about 3 weeks ago after playing an hour or two most days since launch, but haven't played since the day before the latest crap patch. 
---
I set a calendar reminder on my outlook to check back on the game in april, and still lurk the subreddit to see how it's going.
---
It hasn't been very positive. Wonder if I'll just snooze that April alarm or If things will improve
---
I mean like so you can spend it on a card you want to, or change a point around. Like a level up. Would be cool if you could turn those useless duplicate cards into something actually useful. But I know at some point people are going to have their perfect build and all cards they want so that won't be helpful at that point.
---
It don't work WITH mods cause they made it online servers only with no private servers when in reality I'm willing to bet the majority of people just wanted a co-op fallout game but we get this garbage with the atomic shop cause $$$
---
Yeah, I enjoy this game for the most part but it's things like that that make me say the game is a piece. I had just spent the last couple hours grinding for materials and I lost them all. Really frustrating
---
Since i don’t know what an “incel” is, i will take it as a compliment. Thank you for the kind words. 
---
It just happens if you've killed a mob and one's left. 
---
Thanks for the offer, but right now I've got one Weightless leg and one Vangaurd leg so I'm good. 
---
We get new card packs from time to time, having a option to say put cards in to store could be an idea. Like a stash box but cards? 
---
   Or let us trade  or give away perk cards 
---
Mine wasn't so nice either. I was out at the quarry North of Watoga doing some repairs when I got hit with an explosive round. 
---
Only thing was nothing happened, I took no damage, I guess that's another benefit of the healing factor mutation. 
---
After a few rounds the clown switched over to melee and still nothing happened. The guy was at least 40 levels higher than me and the only good weapon I had was an explosive hunters smg, if I engaged, I would've got wrecked. So I just stood there vomiting on him. 
---
He switched to something explosive automatic, all the while I taunted him. He eventually left. 
---
I checked my armor, it looked in good condition, so I rolled out. I expected to be reported as a hacker but I'm still playing. 
---
Pm'd you
---
Logged into today at my camp and found a level 80 above my head. Good times. Especially since its Sonic attacks also fly out it's ass as it's flying away from you somehow. 
---
Londoner had the same issue earlier
---
My friends and I still play nightly, and I'm at over 500 hours now. We've all taken to making new characters with ridiculous builds (one is intentionally collecting diseases to RP a plague walker mutated person) while I'm doing a low-HP ninja build that only uses knives.
---
Honestly, though, if I were playing solo I'd just go back to FO4 since it's an objectively superior single player experience. It's really being able to run around with my friends that makes the game so much better. Also, it's fun to RP a trader on the many trading subreddits!
---
Yeah exactly. I've updated the post, thanks! 
---
I think you mean Starfield?
---
It's a common myth the light at the top of lighthouses spins. The truth is that they phase in and out of reality.
---
The first time I saw him was outside of the Eastern Penitentiary, which isn't shown on there.
---
He basically travels every dang road on the map.
---
You clearly never made a 2nd character in Destiny 2. You could love the game and hate the campaign. 
---
It’s a pretty damn fun game. Although I wouldn’t exactly say fun for everyone, though... I enjoy it very much, and still play it at least 4 times a week to this day. Having a chance to interact with random people in the beautiful and majestic wasteland in Live and Let Live situations is actually a lot nicer than I thought it would be, to be honest. The whole trading system is pretty cool as well. Sure, a little bit of the community is kinda toxic and annoying, but aside from that and all of the Bethesda shit people are going on about, the game is wonderful in my opinion.
---
Yep over 400 hours and still enjoying.
---
armor 3 reduces the mats needed to craft in the first place. white knight requires less mats to repair and fix it good allows you to repair to 200% of base durability. 
---
Tbh I wouldn't bother with the fusion core perk since they last awhile (unless you're using her pack) and are pretty easy to get and energy guns kinda suck in general ATM and big guns imo  arent good enough to offest their weight but that's just me good luck on your build
---
im with you on the pony.
---
I'm am playing something else.  Just checking the Reddit.  But I still like the game lol, just don't want to play so much every day :P need more content or something (or friends that play, also hard to come by)
---
After the last two patches I noticed the worlds are never full. I've been in a full server like once since that patch. I mostly play at night and that's when it's most dead.
---
selling cheap ammo for 1 cap per bullet would quickly empty all the merchants. i personally think they should allow us to Bulk Ammo in the same increments that we can craft them (default numbers) so say if i bulk some 5MM rounds, it would be as a box of 100
---
**bethesda:** (releases fallout 76)
---
**public:** this game is buggy as fuck! Please fix this!
---
**bethesda:** Hey, Rage 2 is gonna be *pretty* cool.~
---
The light is stationary. It's reality that rotates around it.
---
When the pipes repair glitch in silo happens I equip lock pick and hacker , bypass the repair 
---
People are entitled to their opinions. You don't have to be rude because you disagree.  Or maybe you just need a nap?
---
Have you tested this by checking weight then putting them into your stash and checking again?
---
Dev list of fixes = add more pointless crap to the Atom
---
Shop
---
Dang, that really sucks. I hope it starts working at some point!
---
I'm quite sure this was not meant to be funny, but I snickered anyway....
---
I guess Bethesda are consistent if nothing else :/
---
That's a good idea brah
---
I've seen one maybe two there every 10 server hops, but since the patch I'm seeing them much more frequently. Generally two level 80s and a fifty.
---
During the most recent ooccurance, there were three of us that loaded in to the clubhouse at roughly the same time (thankfully) . We took the 50 out in no time, but then all of a sudden the two 80s started attacking each other followed by a deathclaw getting into it with the two of them. It made taking them out much easier.
---
I've never seen two scorchbeast fight each other, so that was cool.
---
Yay, we did it!
---
All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.
---
I bought the mod thinking it would be cool, but now I'm thinking the kinetic servos would actually serve me better so the mod is just hanging around in my inventory.  I'd be happy to pass it along to someone who will actually use it, however it will still be a few hours before I'm able to play (stupid work interfering with my gaming life...grumble, grumble, grumble) 
---
Yup I remember you, I used to do a bunch of trading too, but since last patch I'm out too.
---
if you REALLY do not wanna fight one, they did buff a perk to allow you to pacify them, get rank 3 and hope you hit that 75%
---
(Unless i am mistaken or they go back on it)
---
That's the DLC isn't it ; )
---
Oops, forgot 
---
Sorry, i ran into so many groups doing this to me that i just uninstalled the game. I cant spend more than 15 min on a server without someone doing this to me. There comes a point when ive given up ALL of my caps that i could no longer support this game. Its sad but the abuse this game gets is absurd. They need to take it down do their changes and re launch the game. Youve alread got money for this shit experiance. Just go offline, no warning no speach just take it down wipe all character lvls and stashes and fix your shit. Yea it will suck but all the issues caused this, you want to blame aomeone blame the dupers ruining the game economy because now ever fuckwit woth mommy and dadys credit card have tse or multiple tse and it has ruined everything, not to mention that the armours too, things like vanguard sentinel and ect that make them invincible. Its absurd no one should have full sets of everything, it would take literal MILLION of legendary kills. Ive been playing non stop since the beta (on disability leave from work) i have well over 600 hours into this game. I have literally perfected the art of farming legendaries and found the best 2 locations and can clear them out within 15 min and still stop by the vendors in those location. O have yet to jave a single tse drop for me. I have never seen sentinel, let alone a vanguard sentinel. The most powerful wepons o have is a normal 2 shot shotty and a nocturnal auto handmade. So quite frankly ut needs to be done. The damage tp the economy has happened and this is the only fox now. Reset EVERYTHING. And we need everyone to stand behond this.
---
As my last ditch effort to improve this game i am writing a detailed list of everythig that needs to happen, just to improve quality of life for everyone. This will be the last time i post on this sub. Tho it will take me a few more days of writing. Im at somewhere in the range of a thousand words and not even finished.
---
3 perk cards and rad worms disease, which is bugged and buffs lots of stuff by 50%, but only råd damage received. 
---
Great analysis over all.  
---
Your point about Bethesda / Staff being annoyed at the offered help us valid, but at some point sometimes we have to admit, as a person or a group, help is needed.  
---
I've been in that place myself, both personally and professionally, and generally speaking the times I chose to go it alone,'did not go nearly as well as when I accepted the help. Invalid and poor analogy as it is, it is why I try.  
---
The "ignoring" is coming from the "black hole" it feels like the submission process is, even an acknowledgement of the issue(s) for example would reassure many, not just the needy high maintenance   mod authors. ;)   
---
I mean if you've seen some of DMV likely, hellishly limbo situations we've been in, the frustration is justified. 
---
How many times can you follow this workflow before you loose your mind a bit.  
---
Submit a ticket --&gt; Do troubleshooting with Support --&gt;  
---
Receive a notice the issue is being passed on to the Dev's and advised to post on social media to get more attention from the Dev's --&gt;  
---
Post on Social Media --&gt; Have a community manager tell you to submit a ticket.   
---
The directly line, even a one sided mailbox address, is an "ask" but maybe not an unrealistic one with some factors considered.  
---
The submissions we've submitted often literally either involve the actual fix or important troubleshooting info / issue triggered by exactly X + Y.     
---
Also If they get 1,001 bug reports on a specific issue, and assuming a certain and likely indisputable amount of fatigue on their side (many insider articles suggest being a Dev for a studio is not too dissimilar to trying to become a "partner", other than a fraction of the salary and benefits, aka your life is hell and you work insane hours) how do they catch and filter out the couple, or being generous, the dozen submitted tickets that have useful information?  
---
That was one of the goals, and I went for it because I know more than a dozen notable authors who have quit '76 due to the issues it has and the fact their reports and feedback seem to fall on deaf ears. (As "evidenced" by the lack of acknowledgement of the issues,'or them being addressed).   
---
Yes we are all fatigued and tired of the "whining", "I quit" and more importantly "this game sucks" posts, but my concern, (and maybe falsify) I think it should also concern Bethesda, is both the frequency and the huge drop in activity in this sub since last Tuesday.   
---
Micro vs Macro, the sub represents enough of the user base to be considered a indicator of sorts.   
---
Hell 2 weeks ago I don't think I ever saw a post with 12 upvotes end up in the "hot post" list on my phone.   
---
So, you basically never craft anything. Great.
---
That would be nice but imo fixing the bugs raising stash limit lowering the cost of atom shop items, making events longer harder with better rewards and adding in new worthwhile content on a semi regular basis will bring back more people
---
Definitely, it's like they expected people to have plenty to do for a while with just a DPS check boss for an "endgame" and now tried to pad the game with more repair and resource management bullshit as if they already forgot the game was nearly bursting at the seams with that exact nonsense and thia will just make more people throw in the towel even sooner.
---
Yea I hear ya bro. I use it. I like it. I love my silenced crafted shotty. 
---
I'm on PC
---
I have seen a drop off in the amount of Nuked areas, usually while playing I'd get the Nuke alarm or when I log in I see part of the map has been nuked but that is getting to be a rare thing. Keep in mind Resident Evil 2 Remake (really good if you like that kind of game) came out, that new EA Battle Royale (free) is out now. New DLC content will bring them back in but for how long? Not sure. I still play a couple times a week as I'm only Level 30 and have been taking my time on it. We may be getting to the point of where only the Die hards are playing. Sometimes I see only a few white dots on the map but other times I see the map just about to capacity. If the game does die I hope they release the server side so we can host private gaming sessions. I hope they would release private servers before the game goes off the cliff (I don't think it's going anywhere for a while but just saying). Yes ditch survival and add in more game content, maybe Giant Creatures that takes a whole server to kill? Like a giant Earthworm or something? Add in aliens and stuff like that.
---
Ammo cheap. 
---
Totally down for the free pony.  
---
It's annoying still to run out. Can't build more water purifiers or fusion generators, can't do a ton of gun upgrades.
---
Fuck yes.  I fucking hate that bullshit.  Scorchbeasts are a fucking awful idea to start, it's a cheap way of swiping dragons from Skyrim, but even with the focus Fallout has on ranged combat it's just an unpleasant slog to fight them WHEN THEY WORK PROPERLY, WHICH IS ABOUT 1/2 THE TIME ONLY!
---
I play a no PA tank build, and they chew through my armor like it's not there when they are glitching like that.  I've had more than one rage quit from bugged out scorchbeasts.
---
Curious what that level is. I'm just under 60 and still running out of them constantly.
---
I'm on x1 so may be a bug or something but I'll triple check it with different armor stats  possibilities ect when I get home from work
---
I have the same issue
---
Buts its a cost that melee dosnt have, therefore giving it a higher upkeep and therefore it deserves to out perform it. 
---
This so much. I would really \*love\* to spam craft a bunch of weapons to learn mods but it's just not feasible given all the other things you need screws for.
---
Level 4 lock picking is the ultimate level and all doors and containers just spring open as you approach them.

I favor the daedric or supernatural eldrich horrors theories too! Lets not forget Fallout 3's Dunwich Building either....  We find evidence of some dark ritual happening there where they were trying to summon or worship the supernatural being of Ug-Qualtoth.  Maybe at the Borers quarry in FO4, they were trying to dig where they thought the being or some artifact of it was buried.
---
They reminded me of a Bud Spencer and Terrence Hill movie. Both are secret agents who tried to find a secret hideout of K1. They found a restaurant and 2 men who said goodbye to their wife before going to the toilet. They never came out of the toilet so they decided to follow them. The toilet then transported them to the hideout of K1.
---
Or it could be a reference to the men in black 2 after they flushed out from the mib office. 
---
Ok cupcake.
---
Don't belittle how unfun fighting them is.  If you hang out in the bog they are all fucking over, will follow you for miles, and it's just not an enjoyable experience to fight them.  It's far, far worse when they decide to never land and a step beyond that when they bug out and nonstop spam their energy attack.
---
It's fucking bullshit even if you don't mind dealing with it every now and then.
---
Scorch Beasts are the worst, most unfair enemy I have ever fled from. 
---
I did the Firebreathers exam, at the Belching Betty mine. Go outside, try to hand in my result to the robot but he is freaking out. A minute later, I hear the flap of wings. Suddenly the beast descends along with about a dozen scorched (first however I am assaulted by these invisible foes because they haven't loaded in yet). I run, dodging the sonic blasts and screaming scorched as best I can, using up all the health items I can until I finally arrive at the safety of the fire hall. 
---
I go off and do some other quests for about half an hour, figure they must have left, spawn back in, they're still all there and I just die. I logged off. Worst, when I log back in, it erased my progress in the Firebreathers exam so I have to do it all over again.
---
My first time encountering them I was walking along a road and just suddenly died. I am perplexed, spawn nearby, walk along again hoping to reclaim my stuff and die again. Only on the third time did it finally load in. Unbelievable. 
---
I had 3 spawn on my camp once. Blasted the thing to pieces. I haven't really played since. 
---
Bethesda: we will nerf you. 
---
Happens to me sometimes as well think it might be unyilding armor at low hp or something
---
funny thing is I can understand some of what they say since where I work we use masks that muffle our voices a lot..
---
Game shouldn't have been released in all honesty. 
---
I keep finding him at Whitesprings
---
Assaultron has also a weak chest. 
---
Yes there is allot of hate, anger and frustration.   
---
If anything the growing silence from the Community, and the reduced numbers should be even more concerning.  
---
But I do think they are backed into a corner and almost choice they make is going to be "good enough" to silence the crowd of (valid or not) nay-Sayers.   
---
And to be honest, as much as I'd love to hear an acknowledgement of the state of things, we will likely never, ever see one, it opens them up to far too many liability issues.  
---
I mean didn't you watch "Marvels IronFist"?   
---
A CEO even emphasizing with the plight and apologizing for someone suffering opens you up to liability hell ;)
---
I went to a random locations and 3 of them bitches spawned. I quit and went back to resident evil 2. I was extremely pissed to find out my explosive shotgun got nerfed so bad that they should be regular guns now.
---
This guy has no idea what he is talking about lol.  Bloodied rifles/shotguns are just as if not more effective in power armour.  If anything, if you want to do a ton of damage with a bloodied melee weapon you would wear unyeielding gear.  Say you wanted to kill the sbq quickly, prime receiver on a bloodied ranged weapon will literally drop her in moments.  (no melee equivalent to prime exists with bloodied melee, could get zealot but then it won't have bloodied) 
---
Anyway they want melee nerf because they still don't understand the game mechanics.   
---
That's a nice spot. Little too high traffic for me though, ultimately. Had my camp trashed a couple of times, and probably by random mobs and not even players. Junk excavators are great though, I'm just currently more bottlenecked by other stuff.
---
I don’t know. I feel like I have found dirty pillows all over the map, not just around the cabin and manor, but what do I know haha
---
Seems to be working fine now...well, as fine as it gets with the crappy framerate a lot of the time.
---
I just stopped taking over public workshops, Its not worth the waste in caps, 
---
when i do take them over i dont bother defending them, because its not worth the waste in caps. 
---
when i do decide to defend them some time always goes wrong and it just ends up pissing me off. 
---
Last night for some odd reason i was next to spruce knob and i was like hey let me grab that workshop i heard it was good xp, I killed all the super mutants and took over the work shop, got some  meh what ever stuff and a stim pack, made my credits back.. immediately a "defend the workshop" mission popped" i killed wave 1 and was mid wave 2 killing all the mutant hounds showing up... for some wild ass reason i clicked on the elevator and my game locked up..
---
So i just turned off the xbox and went to go play the alpha game i got into where i have access to the developers and can tell them what I want to change (i cant really say much more cause of the NDA).
---
Especially for the amount of budget they take up!
---
&gt; That is a complaint which was handled summarily and in a way that should have been short enough for even the most lazy to read. 
---
Oh, so I did what you should have done to begin with? Now we're getting somewhere...
---
Got killed by a silent, invisible scorchbeast once. My health just went down all of a sudden and when I revived in the same place the scorchbeast had finally decided to make itself visible
---
To be honest, the state of the developer isnt much better
---
in france it' s ok if it can help you ...
---
Fallout 76 is a real survival game. The interest of most players did not survive a month longer. The rest of the players did not survive through numerous software errors.
---
A fish rots from the head down.
---
Nice spot but since two weeks, I can't put my camp there while connecting... Too muchbpeople on this spot :(
---
I will absolutely agree that the enemy design needs work.  Everything needs less health and higher damage, and ways to mitigate the higher damage through gameplay.  The Mirelurk queen for instance is a ridiculous fucking bullet sponge and there's no trick, you pound it till it's dead or you run out of stimpacks.  You move around so it's acid ground attack doesn't keep hitting you but since you can't see it and it'll hit you some no matter what, it's still just a matter of spamming heals till the fucker goes down.
---
This can be said of almost any major enemy in the game, except maybe scorchbeasts and only then because they are legit broken, and even so it's still just a healing endurance battle.
---
I haven't even used any of the atoms earned by playing... 
---
If your on after 7pm (EST) tonight send me message.  750 caps.
---
True, they are indeed all over the place.
---
I'd say delaying something that is already years away is pretty short sighted
---
76 is giving BGS Austin something to do and to hold over Fallout fans cuz FO5 isn't coming for a long LONG time
---
76s problems have nothing to do with SF
---
And considering SF and 76 aren't the same teams you shouldn't use 76 as an indication of how SF will be
---
Had the same epiphany the first time I watched "Dexter"...... ;)
---
But seriously stereotypes and archetypes exist for a reason.    
---
Thx!! def my next purchase..nothing else really caught my eye i only got outfits so far
---
What's your problem, dude is just raging on something that annoys all of us. He's not calling the game shit, he's not talking about quitting, he's just sharing his irritation at one of the more broken mechanics that annoys the shit out of all of us.
---
They have to delay both anyway. After this, releasing another game on this decrepit tech will turn them I to a laughing stock. 
---
Are you playing on console, specifically xbox
---
Oh.  Thank you.  
---
I'm not
---
Just curious why comment that here?
---
Care to share?  I like to duck under cover but unless someone else is hitting it they'll never land if I do that.
---
yeah lets just throw balance completely out the window. 
---
Im assuming they stay seperated in the stash and just have the diamond thing next to them? I noticed when I picked up multiples it stays at one tech doc in my personal inventory. 
---
Exactly! I think Fallout 3 is the best evidence that they were planning this storyline for a long time. Maybe Ug-Qualtoth and the Interloper are the same entity, who knows? Hopefully F76 will give us some answers...
---
I’m deleting that, but I got sent to the wrong post somehow. Guess I missclicked somehow.
---
This complaint does not answer the question
---
If it was a matter of choosing one over the other, I'd rather they cut their losses on 76 and shift all dev resources to upcoming games. Fortunately, this is not and will never be the case. 76 is a mess, but clearly enough people like it to justify its continued development.
---
Fuck this shit, I totally agree. You cannot see a damn thing behind these blasts, they spit them out from any angle possible, even when these flying fucks are flying away or making a u-turn, they give you no reward, they're hitboxes are BS, they hit you through the walls and roofs, and they are just boring and annoying and epilepsy hazardous. This was a lazy af design that no one has ever tested and there are no excuses for that.
---
could you imagine if you got ballistic fiber for scrapping your armor? game-changer
---
This is helpful, thanks 
---
hardcore would be full loot and perma death. 
---
Underwear and  a clownshat
---
My friend moved his built camp for the first time last week and freaked out when he couldn’t place it.  He thought he lost everything and would have to build over with new materials.
---
I am infamous among my friends for constantly moving my camp.
---
In fact I spent my lunch break today thinking about a new place to move it.
---
I can tell you don't get it.  Right over you're head.  Feel free to respond. I won't be seeing any further replies.  Good bye.
---
I mean, Beowulf *is* the oldest work of English literature and arguably the most important.
---
But to each their own I suppose. 
---
Great. I was just looking into farming caps to pay for some of the end-game content (Expensive recipes, mutation serums, all C.A.M.P. item blueprints...), used 3 levels to get Cap Collector rank 3, and find it was broken just a few days ago. Some days it just doesn't even pay to try. :S
---
THIS
---
need at least 3 different layouts
---
Fighting

PvP
---
It grinds my gears needing to switch cards around all the time esp passive cards like lockpick hard bargain ect
---
To be honest the best option is to read the title of a post and just scroll past. There are some good posts in this thread but you need to scroll down the list a little to get to them.
---
There is a good post about all the masks in the  FO76 world today. Read that one, highly recommended. I will probably go visit the sites mentioned in the post again to see it in person.
---
Sorry to upset your delicate snowflake sensibilities with a single word, how do you even survive IRL.
---
Yep, always a risk, especially with disappearing bags and crashing servers.  It is good to go into the wasteland with a buddy.  I hear that the wasteland is a dangerous place...
---
How much extra damage does primed weapons do?
---
I kind of wish your poll had some more options, I would have been curious how much people have bought and which packages. Actually surprised to see so many people have spent money... can't justify paying a bunch of money for so little return but the Canadian prices are higher than the American ones.
---
Understood, just having fun with it running a different direction for a moment.  
---
I love all the armchair CEOs and Developers on this sub.
---
Yeah, fair enough. So does single malt whiskey.
---
Agree to disagree.  
---
Actually the last time I saw him he was wandering down the street in Watoga. Going west down the first road you come to leaving the train station, when you're running up to see Phoenix.
---
I'd prefer screws, but fuck year that would be amazing and of course makes sense.
---
I'm not a dick and I take naps.  Stay pressed.
---
&gt; The owner immediately sent me a party invite
---
I know I regularly invite anyone that shows up at a workshop that I took over to share - I have only ever had one person attack me in the whole game.
---
I tend to check the bodies of regular enemies around the legendary when this happens. Sometimes I'll find the legendary on them instead of the actual legendary enemy. Could just be in my head.
---
I've had this issue too on my pistol character. Another problem I have is that when I VATS something it always starts at their legs now? It used to target the torso first and it's really irritating.
---
I don't know. Doom 2 looks pretty tits... Bethesda is still involved in that.
---
Each skill had a cap of 100

😂🤣😂
---
This was the exception so far, for me too.  I'm a bit better equipped if it happens again, but it does highlight a gross oversight to me.  I think one thing that I failed to note in the original post is that he stuck around and got hit by his own artillery thus possibly contributing to him not getting a high wanted level. 
---
Thankfully, I've had good overall interactions besides this.
---
I've had mixed results. Obvious good spots seem to be contentious. Found a nice acid vent in the forest with a great view, and built a huge CAMP. Next day I login and the spot was taken. Re-logged and had just got back there from the fast travel spot, and some level 250+ with a TSE showed up and trashed everything in a couple of minutes. I couldn't afford the mat cost to repair anyway, so I decided maybe this just wasn't the place for me.
---
Currently way off the beaten path now, and the view is even better than the last place. Also nice because there's a random assortment of ore deposits all within a short walking radius.
---
Hmm didn’t know that! Thanks for the info. 
---
Triggering intensifies
---
Still out for London then will try later.
---
well you can use mods.
---
When you die in pvp you should have 3 options,
---
I am currently running FO76 with 20 mods, 16 from Nexus and 4 of my own.  All of the mods are straight quality of life enhancements or audio/visual mods.
---
One mod that I used to run, "Known Plans" was recently turned into an actual game feature, rolled into patch 5.
---
I was told he goes through that train tunnel, but never had any luck 
---
I never played Destiny 2 at all. :P 
---
And having said that, I don't see parallels between this game and Destiny 2. This isn't a shooter. It's an open world survival RPG that's lite on both survival and RPG. There is no 'campaign', there are a collection of loosely connected main quests that are not mandatory and IMO not that interesting in the first place.
---
That's basically why I don't get the point. I have played games where 2nd characters are boring. But grindy, in FO76? It just doesn't make sense to me. If the only reason you're playing is to level up as fast as possible then yea, it could feel grindy even though it's really not demanding at all. But why would anyone want to play this game that way? It's an approach that will ignore most of the things the game does best while pursuing what basically amounts to a dead-end. 
---
It really makes no sense to me. xD I can't imagine how someone could love this game if all they want is to power level in it. Sounds boring af since the combat performance and challenge are not one of 76's strengths, but that's just my opinion.
---
Ya I’m not getting those it just says respawn
---
Isn't it obvious? I'd scrap and get rid of everything except for the little Mr Handy model I found! Shame I can't display it somewhere in my camp though :( 
---
It’s not even that they hurt; it’s how fucking annoying they are.
---
There was a pretty clear "no" in there. Not sure why they would give you contact details.
---
I would also be tickled if we could upgrade a weapon's level (like voice of set or blade of bastet) instead of junking it and having to rebuild it all from scratch along with all the mods as well.
---
I was doing the same thing with destiny2, all 3 chars, all activities each week- needless to say after the Forge quests i got burnt out.  
---
My friend gave me a free copy of FO76, and taking a break from D2 is one of the best decisons ive made
---
so, maybe just try another game for a bit!
---
haha the guy that played Ironfist annoys the shyte out of me so I made it through about 20 minutes of the first episode :/
---
If there are that many liability issues then they deserve to be prosecuted / taken to court. If they are hiding away because they know there at that many issues they would be liable then that is fraud no?
---
Customers aren't stupid though, they can have open lines of communication with customer's and as long as they are open and honest the hate would die down. If they offered everyone that wanted one a refund (as they should now) it wouldn't be as bad as they think or are assuming. If anything they would probably see increase in sales of future titles and when FO76 was ready they would e able to sucessfuly relaunch.
---
At this moment i time they are doing the least amount possible and playing for time it seem's the longer this goes on the longer they can keep saying they tried and expect customers to forget about it in time for the next product.
---
They seem to be taking there customer service from the John "Gold Finger" Palmer book or John Smedley (the expert at tanking games). They really don't need to though, a bit of humility and openness goes a long way with people. Ignoring the facts then advertising cos plays / new merchandise is never the way to go is it.
---
I’d rather receive nothing than one more legendary golf club or rolling pin or tire iron. 
---
Scorchbeast .......a poem
---
S is for sponge and all the HP it has
---
C is for cry for all the ammo you'll waste
---
O is for OMG which you'll surely scream
---
R is for running which is all you'll see
---
C is for Camp which they always seem to find
---
H is for hate the feeling that it gives
---
B is for bombardment and all the echoes you see
---
E is for easy the one thing it's not
---
A is for apthay if you get killed
---
S is for server hop which I'll always do
---
T is for two shot explosive which no longer will do
---
I will! 
---
Yep they're honestly just horrible and need to be seriously altered or something. They just constantly spam scream with their ranged sonic attack along with that acid bombardment or whatever it is. 
---
I wouldn't mind as much if you could actually avoid the spamming somehow, but so long as your within it's sight and not deep within a structure you just get hit with constant splash damage. Not only that but the visual effect of the sonic attack is so overwhelming sometimes you can't see anything. Ugh and that god damn screaming makes me wish I was deaf. 
---
To top it off the rewards are garbage for the amount of ammo used, durability lost and aid items used. 
---
I don’t know about.  I think the game was just poorly designed. 
---
Oh look ANOTHER angry boy. Trust me this not worth it. Get over it and move on. 
---
what weapons are they ? 
---
I’m taking a long break until they sort this out. My char is near the end of the main story line and I’m happy to wait until the bugs are finally fixed to complete the final quests. This has a lot of potential but I’m tired of playing the inventory mgmt simulation and the crashes and bugs. Cheers!
---
Only on PC.  Besides, it should not require a 3rd party app to provide functionality that should have been incorporated in the baseline game at day one. 
---
I see him a lot but always in the Mid-west part of the map.  I don't spend a disproportion amount of time there and pretty much only pass through the area as part of a cap run on vendors.  He is fighting the other super mutants in Summersville often.  When I used to take the nearby Cabins workshop (for lead earlier in the game) he would  drop by often also, as in when I fast traveled back to the workshop he would be waiting.  He has appeared at other workshops and locations, but never as frequently has in those two locations.
---
232 lol
---
32 - CAMP budget increase
---
I agree with the bulk of this comment but something about the comment 
---
&gt; Singleplayer games don't last months, they last days.
---
strikes me as absurdly wrong. Like this is only applicable if you play extremely short and linear single player games with no replayability like The Order 1886
---
All businesses should give you contact details for anyone in the company 
---
I see.  I did not know about white knight.   But I I feel the affects of Armorer and White Knight should be from the same perk card.  
---
Ugh, I feel your pain. Recently moved camps so I set up the Grafton steel workshop for mats. The super mutants 90 levels below me were breaking my turrets almost as fast as I could set them up. Eventually was so disgusted that I swept through the rest of the mill to clear out the several dozen that seem to spawn and just left a field of broken turrets behind. Why waste the gears to repair?
---
That’s the only card I have for my single charisma point, because I’m just not very charismatic. 
---
And also you cant forget that melee has the blocking ability that ranged weapons don’t posses, over all they were pretty balanced with each other on release, the key to being good was having a good build and the correct gear, the weapon was more common than the good legendary armours so people blamed it, now only melee can do damage against certain armours in pvp, then that shall be pointed out and nerfed, then no one will be able to kill each other because of the armour, so that shall be nerfed, bethesda has the wrong approach to a manufactured issue, to stop people that dont want to be 1 hit in pvp they should hurry up and release their pvp servers and make adventure mode 100% pvp free. 
---
whenever I get the scorchbeasts as a defense on a bench I just leave and let them have it then do the retake. It saves you a ton of ammo and durability
---
What about trading in perk cards, say 10 so it wont get over powered, to add an extra point in any SPECIAL and would max at 20? It'd start as an option at level 50 and you could either take a new perk card or move a point like you can currently or cash in 10 cards to get an extra special point? 
---
yeah..tbh..screws/gears/springs..i have the most of..ballistic fiber alway gave me trouble :(
---
Real question:
---
Is there any point to bulking other than selling scrap? I literally never bulk unless I'm on my way to a vendor. 
---
yeh vats always does that to me..vats doesnt really work in this game...not like fallout 4 vats was awesome
---
But you did get 300+ hours from a game, which is rare from a game these days.
---
I really dislike the circlejerk around people thinking that anything useful will be nerfed... 
---
Buuuut, as a longtime wow player the expression should be "FUN DETECTED"
---
I usually find him on the road from Top of the World past Whitesprings station
---
It targets the limb that you targeted last. So if you had the Head focussed on your last enemy it will target the Head when you activate VATS again. At least that is how it works for me, I experimented with it a little bit.
---
I actually quite like that, it makes lining up head shots very quick. When VATS work, that is.
---
I run 2 characters at the same time, I wanted to have another for PVP and extra nukes so I made one. I didn't want to go through the story again for more fetch quest fun. I had to grind the queen and whitesprings over and over to get levels. I could have did the main story line but I know it would have took longer than the week it did to get my alt to level 50. 
---
I know Diablo 3 and FO76 are not similar, however, it's all about rushing to end game content. So there are games that do it.
---
Plastic and lead for crafting shotgun ammo and springs and screws for repairing guns or PA. Ballistic fiber for armor. Fusion cores, and the flux stuff
---
Nope I still have thousands of unspent atoms I got for free 
---
I still Really like the pallets idea that's been floated a few times on this reddit.
---
CAMP items that are just a stackable pallet of a material, when scrapped return the full cost, and cost maybe 1 wood or something to repair to prevent them becoming a target for griefers.
---
It would be so cool and immersive to create a storage space within my camp for mass storage of scrap. 
---
I know the exact spot you mean because my fiancée builds there and it’s beautiful! I build over by the oil spot nearby and I think there’s an iron ore spot nearby. I haven’t ran into anyone building in my oil spot yet but she has experienced one or two people building over the acid spot. A server hop fixes that usually. 
---
Bonus points, you rejoin the same server.  Then proceed to get spawn camped by them while waiting for load to finish.
---
I've been trying to leave stuff in the overseer's cache. Seems like people on xbox don't nearly drop stuff in world-containers as much as other platforms so I assume a lot of it goes to waste. Even then, it rarely looks like anyone else is doing that, but I think it's still a safer bet.
---
Funny though, I went to drop a ton of duplicate plans in the overseer cache the other day and someone else had already put like twice as many as I had in there. I couldn't actually dump them all because I got an "Overseer Cache is full" message.
---
This. Calling Reek a masochist shows a fundamental misunderstanding of either, the word masochist itself, or Reek as a character.
---
Haven’t bought any. Won’t so long as basic game functionality doesn’t exist. 
---
I like how they say the issues have been addressed....in a ITV! not in a patch that fixes them but in an article about a patch that broke more than it fixed.
---
They really are clueless. It's been a cash grab from start to finish, bet this week's ITV is just as vague and empty as all the others.
---
I hope the people at Bethesda involved with this need some customer service at some point in the future and get fucked over as much as there customers have been.
---
Interesting. I swear that I usually leave off on the torso but I'll have to see if it works that way for me.
---
Had 3 show up at my base before my 3* TSE was nerfed. Asked my friend to fast travel to me and we kicked their asses with a smile. Lol. Now that would be all my shotgun ammo. 😣
---
What's blast time? 
---
Just in game ! Thanks to you !
---
I guess we have to assume that even though our char can build a fusion generator from scratch parts, they just mangle the shit out of all the screws trying to take something apart.

SURPRESSIVE FIRE THUM THUM THUM THUM THUM THUM THUM THUM THUM

For a shooter, probably.  Melee have a good chance of killing them in one go if they land at that level.  If they land at least.
---
over your carry weights perhaps?
---
Can you spawn at V76 still?
---
Forgot to say, GT JakePlace1005
---
fans have screws but clipboards just have springs, fwiw.
---
The last Item was it for me, 
---
My younger brother loves the game, I got a playstation just to play it with him, when I found myself coming here in desperation for ANY news that would make me want to keep playing it, it brought back painful memories of how much I used to fantasize of the great content right around the corner in "Destiny". Hoping for news of future content so I have desire to play today is just not sustainable. 
---
They would love to put this in game...unfortunately it's to hard for them to figure out how :(
---
The game is not for you. Mark it and move on to another game.
---
(pause for a moment of self introspection)
---
I figure the market forces will sort it out.  
---
Still just as funny
---
That’s developed by ID and Avalanche, not BGS Austin.
---
So I hear, but have you seen the footage?

Omw to grab the .308 hopefully.
---
We need to constantly remind Bethesda what's wrong, but in my opinion this game isn't even close to being as bad as many people on this sub say it is. 
---
Don't they just get bored and leave instead of capping the shop?
---
It's a tough situation. I think that in order for modders to be truly effective Bethesda would have had to design their development process with those modders in mind. But that didn't happen, so trying to tack them onto the process now is probably more than they want to deal with-- especially with all the problems going on with this game (in terms of development, release, and reception).
---
All said, I would agree that there should be some changes. Though I don't feel comfortable making suggestions (or even accepting most player suggestions) because there's this huge void of data I don't have concerning Bethesda and how it works. :/   So I'm just kind of drifting through posts and enjoying what I can get out of the game for now. I know from past experience with NV and FO4 that the 'real' game won't come until we get mods and private servers anyway. :P
---
I'm gonna jump in game in a few minutes but last comment on this sub-- I've started to use the Filthy Casual forums more than FO76 because of the degeneracy going on here lately. I don't have an overall problem with increased criticism, but I really detest the BS posts that make claims with no proof, and the streams of complaints rather than critical views. So I wouldn't take any decrease in this sub's activity to heart as an indication of the game's struggles. Filthy Casuals just hit 8k users the other day, which is comparatively a piddly amount of users, but I believe it's likely correlating to the decrease in 76 subbers, and that some of them at least are simply either finding a new home or choosing not to engage with the outcries and backlash.

One thing I truly believe from my experience in MMOs is that even though this sub might be a decent sample size for opinions, that doesn't mean the opinions represent anything statistically significant. And by that I mean two things:  1. The number of people voicing criticism here is important, and Bethesda should pay attention to that; but, 2. Just because the sample is acceptably large doesn't mean it's reflective of the rest of the game players. In that regard I do consider this sub to be a vocal minority and consequently I don't think its complaints (while they may be valid) are worth catering to. 
---
But I'm an amateur dev of sorts myself, so I have some bias there. I really don't like the idea of gaggles of people who think they know best telling me how I should design my game, so I don't think much of that kind of feedback when it's directed at other devs. xD
---
It's not so much the damage that bothers me. UT the extreme fps drop because of the multiple constant scream attacks. I'm not op but I've has this happen to me countless times and it's beyond broken!
---
Not really for a game-as-a-service type of game. 
---
Dude your reply completely ignores the context of the comparison being made. The things you pointed out are irrelevant to Moeparkers point. Which is that like Overwatch, FO76 brings the popular choices down, instead of raising the others to be desirable as well.
---
Yea when they gonna change this???
---
I do see an awful lot of people in this thread that apparently are sitting on 100s of screws. I can only assume these people don't craft much or run melee builds, or they are all level 100+ and play 10 hours a day still and are actually getting more than they know what to do with.
---
It just might work! 🤔
---
House... Road House!
---
It clearly is. 
---
I'd rather them fix the damn game than add content. It's reprehensible that the game was launched in this state. 
---
Just wanted to point out that it was known that this game was going to have a pvp component to it.  So people who did not wanted to be bothered by other players should not have purchased the game. 
---
I believe there is a page on the website that shows if the game is live on each platform, but if you referring to server lists then I believe they havnt published that, which is a shame i would be very interested to see how many servers they have live and what the population is like.
---
After the hotfix I can confirm they'll still use 100% of the cells in your inventory.  Not sure if they fixed that prior to that point or not, but that's what it does now
---
How do you escalate a complaint, customer has a right if they are unsatisfied with the service/support provided to go higher in the company.
---
I suppose there's also a natural downturn in screw demand once you hit 50 and have re-crafted all your armor and weapons to their max level.
---
The ones at Monogah?! 
---
I’ve been there bud. 
---
Fuck those guys. 
---
Whether I want them to or not, actually. I try to stay away from prisons...
---
Outstanding. Thank you for warning me.
---
He ment a real pony 
---
I did too 
---
I also get *Ignore*
---
Man that is the worst. Like you take the time and kill everything and then you can't loot them. I have waited minutes before and then sometimes I swear you wait so long that it just shows nothing. I can understand for 1 or 2 but after slaughtering everything in Whitesprings Golf Club, there has to be loot on a few at least. I just have never seen the loot lag like that in a game before, sometimes I don't even want to check a duffle bag or something because it will just piss me off with the lag.
---
Borderline harassment from a shitty customer.  I get the whole entitled to victim role we have cultivated, but there is a point when its just cringe.  In this case, 01/26/2019 07:53 PM, is where you cut your losses, write your bad review, then commit to **never buying from Bethesda again** and the world moves on.
---
OK now I do recall the skills.
---
You evidently don’t know Bethesda then. 
---
yeah, I have to avoid getting too close to the bot-populated areas when farming flora-mats for stable flux.  Melee makes it less likely you'll hit one, but it still happens when a random assaultron comes barreling into the fight out of nowhere.
---
I'm just here to watch.
---
Most days I block -all- from session on logging in.
---
The last time that I didn't immediately do that, within 10min a griefer with a TSE and a bounty was at my camp, wrecking.
---
I left the server right away. Logged back in. Fixed a wall.
---
Continued to enjoy building.
---
thanks for the .308 ammo. itll last me a long time for some sniping fun.
---
Never seen any evidence of armourer decreasing the materials for repairing. 
---
Don't forget the free pre-nerf TSE arsenal! Gotta have that. 
---
Join us! We have Nuka Grapes and Halloween candy!
---
Swanky AF
---
Use to back when I had high hopes for the game but now the game just isn't worth the investment anymore. Can't see paying for stuff when it's so hard to find enjoyment just in playing the game
---
Traitors! The true Americans will stop you!
---
recover from a workplace injury
---
I built the upgraded turret for my camp and it also made the sound that the explosions do when firing off explosive rounds. It appeared to have the same visual effect as well. 
---
Nope.
---
Generally
---
A - The prices are insane. In a free-to-play game, maybe 10-20 dollar skins are some vaguely justified thing to exist, but not in a full retail title. As has been pointed out myriad times, if you want something as simple as a paint job across all armours, it's more then the actual game was.
---
b)Most of it is novelty schlock that doesn't even mesh with the aesthetic style of the game. Few and far between are anything that looks like it works well. Some of it even contradicts itself (Any costume and any armour paint for instance).
---
Np! ;) 
---
A mixed set, that's fascinating, I'm going to look into this myself. Thanks.
---
People? Yes. Talent? That I'm not so sure of anymore.
---
Not so much of a circlejerk if it becomes the norm... and yes Fun Detected is the correct phrasing LOL! 
---
The funny thing is that this reminds me of the First time CohhCarnage  (twitch streamer) fought the SBQ and she was down to like 10% HP and then the fame crashed and they couldn't get back into the server... Fun Detected was spammed in chat lol
---
What about Radscorpions? Had a couple glowing ones spawn in Whitesprings after someone nuked the place and as a lvl 49 with a lvl 40 hunting rifle couldn't do shit against them. Tried to aim for the head with vats but it either missed, did no damage or the head isn't a weakspot. The only thing that worked against them was running away.
---
Later on i killed a lvl 39 or something normal Radscorpion but it still took too many bullets.
---
I don't have Tank killer yet so maybe i just lack armor penetration?
---
Glowing bloated ghouls (or something like that) are so much easier than those damned scorpions... 
---
I don't want anything nerfed, and you have bad reading comprehension.
---
Bit late for that, I think.
---
Np! ;) Was ment to b here! 😂
---
I keep getting those in drops and keep dumping those heavy bastards into a bag.
---
Also, do you have to keep White knight equipped to have the armor to degrade slower?  
---
How about buff other weapons to balanced instead of this nerf mentality. Energy weapons are all but useless in the current game.
---
I think Bethesda's only publishing Rage 2, not developing it. Like Dishonored 1 and 2. 
---
I would like more C.A.M.P walls, floors, roofs, etc etc etc options like bunker walls we are in a post-nuclear apocalypse so why cam we build a real fallout shelter?
---
If you are on PC there are a few Scorchbeast related QOL mods.  
---
[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/176](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/176) reduces the size and intensity of projectiles so that you aren't completely blind.  
---
[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/174?tab=posts](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/174?tab=posts) changes Scorchbeast's sounds to the sounds made by Pingu the penguin in the children's claymation show called Pingu.  
---
They won't completely fix the issue, but they should help some.  
---
Otherwise, as others have mentioned, Fireproof helps immensely with the scream damage.
---
I didn’t think any weight reduction counted towards stash?
---
Can't just send them a video or pics of the broken helmets?
---
I would send in another ticket, that sound's like your being trolled by a salty member of there support team tbh :/
---
Had two pop up at th ammo factory before with a horde of scorched.   That's when I stopped playing because of how dumb they are with they screech attacks that should have a decent cool down/rest time between attacks. 
---
Haha, oh. I never even realized that! I'll have to look through them all and see then. I always wondered what the gold one was all about.
---
Not for individual servers, but they have a page that tells you if the platform is up or not.
---
[https://bethesda.net/status](https://bethesda.net/status)

You should be penalized for bringing a knife to a gun fight, it should be something that you only need to use close range. They should just have different damage scaling for PvP if that is the issue.  There is no way a random axe worth 2 coins should be 300-400% stronger than a two shot explosive handmade.  The way the armor scaling works it is even worse.  The damage is a mute point, because the kills are so much quicker with melee you take only a fraction of the damage.
---
Anthem is pretty good, Neverwinter is free on xbox

Im on filthy casuals already, tge only reason im here is for betgesdas reaponses to things and patch notes

That's just standard operating procedure 241A, subsection 2 titled:
---
"Hoops, Jumping Through Them, And You - How to Keep Customers from Getting What Was Ordered for as Long as Possible"
---
What level are your turrets?
---
Two shot should be double damage.  Period.  It's two shots.
---
Maybe not rare in that regard, but still decent.
---
No, I dont’t pick up ore. (For that very same reason. )
---
Maybe you just can’t please everyone because there’re people who say they enjoy the game in its current state.  Those people probably are the majority now, since people who were not happy with it had quit playing the game. 
---
I love to spend money on games that I enjoy, even if it is just cosmetics. 
---
But the core game is so broken and weightless that I wouldn't dare spend any more on it than I already have (bought at full retail price). 
---
If they added a ton more sandbox elements and fixed the core of the game's issues, I'd happily spend tons on Atoms. 
---
It's almost like you actually mean sonar, and that either shouldn't see things through objects like trees

That isn't in the slightest, remotest way true.

Being generous to you, it's about 50/50 nerfs and buffs in OVerwatch, but they generally buff when they can.

Clown outfit with tattered mole head is my current outfit... hahaha 
---
Yeah.   Someone told me that there’s a White Knight perk that does just that.  
---
Hey can you help me carry this 30 lb stuff?
---
ROTFLOL!!!
---
That is insane. I would not proceed until you try to talk to someone else.
---
You find a phone number and then you talk to someone and keep asking for supervisors 
---
I would rather be able to exchange some amount of junk cards for a card of my choice. Say 2 for 1 or 5 for 1.
---
Level should have no impact on whether or not they fire - only the damage they do.  I’ve used light, heavy, missile, shotgun.  They are all pointless if all they do is point and not fire.  
---
I think this has to do more with now that the game is further along in life, the players are stronger and can hang out in the fringes of the maps now. Before, there were more people in the forest, TV, and AH.
---
Do you mean the Railway Rifle? I've not seen it mentioned in any of Bethesda's (few) press releases. I think they're currently focusing on heavy and energy weapon rebalancing. 
---
"Life is old there, older than the trees"
---
The Bethesda way :D
---
MMo's also have raid. FO76 is a blank canvas.
---
Your welcome. Have a good day. Sorry for the typo.
---
This is too deep for me.
---
You should not be sorry for destroying people's camps. This is a game mechanic and if they don't like it, they will quit the hell out of from this game.
---
Thats because it was changed from a lootable item to a container, the sound triggers when the object is present in the world
---
I have had that happen to me once at my CAMP.  I had a sign on my house that said "Welcome, please close door when you are done thx!" and one time I came back and about every other letter had "sunk" into the wall.  I also had an "employees must wash hands" sign mounted to a port-a-potty I have in my camp and it had sunk into the porta potty's wall - i saw that when I tried to pick it up to move it.  I ended up ditching the letters on my house, but the sign on the port-a-potty fixed itself the next time I played.  I haven't had that problem since.
---
But you do make a Reddit post complaining about someone making a Reddit post, not sure which is worse.
---
This was possible in Skyrim with an INI edit. IIRC said edit or instructions for it got sent to the Nexus. Not sure if the same method was adapted for Fallout 4.
---
The future is always in the future.
---
You can farm vegetable starch to augment, but I've found adhesive is mostly an early-game bottleneck. Later on you'll be swimming in it, especially if you can get some of the perks that reduce armor/weapon degredation.
---
There's usually tons of duct tape and what not sitting around in garages, warehouses, factories, etc. Keep an eye out for those pegboard tool organizers that hang on walls. Often there's a roll of tape and some useful stuff on them. 
---
You too! And it’s ok
---
You got a discord?
---
omg ur ohiowomans cousin!!!
---
ME TOO OH PLEASE OH PLEASE
---
The one time I was caught in a blast zone (don't you love the log-in delay? /s) I was literally turned to ash, so I'm going to say no.
---
Never. Once the future starts, it’s the present. You’ll always be chasing the future. 
---
I have a 2nd account on xbox that i use to just mule stuff, one of those has a level 5 character named Ammo
---
I saw someone's turret shooting their junk extractor.  I repaired the rest of their camp because it had come under attack and been pretty well flattened.  I went ahead and looted their junk extractor after I repaired it, and that was when I noticed the turret on top was shooting it.  I just shook my head.  Hopefully the rest of their camp stayed repaired.
---
Did you find him in the swimming pool next to the golf club? I keep on seeing him there.
---
Already sent them a pic of both broken with a nice sign that says "replacement for the broken....is broken" but apparently I need to take them to the gun range with a video.
---
If you fail the repair you can just start it again, there isn’t a penalty that I know of. 
---
While it was known there was a pvp element it was also conveyed as a voluntary exercise, so where as they need to prevent the involuntary involvement in pvp, the approach they are taking is wrong in my opinion. But i do slightly agree with you, i have put many hours into the game and i do like the aspect of danger at all encounters, but for the player base of a fallout game them encounters need to be fair (ie scaled on level AND equipment to enable a even playing field).
---
What? I said it doesn't bother me. 
---
Wow. 
---
That would be nice. Not sure what the server constraints are as far as camp budgets are concerned. 
---
I would like an option to 'snap' a camp next to another camp. Both camps' buildable area would become square and you could build in and edit each other's camp (without being teamed up). Just imagine the player-created cities you could create. (and it would be nice to be able to 'join last world' to keep these combined camps together)
---
Workshops are worthless b/c random disconnects and a constant need to empty resource collectors / fend off mole rats. Boring and inefficient. 
---
Nah, why fix things when you can hide away behind excuses and vague statements whilst playing pong :/
---
I agree, some transparency would be nice, what are they hiding?
---
i should have been wearing my witches hat 
---
I really pity anyone who has to deal with you...
---
What you'll have are plasma bursts and atom bomb blasts! Better dead than Red!
---
I dont know the exact weight of the m16 (pog here) i just know its heavier with the m203 haha
---
Added the creepy as fuck faschnacht man mask in the trash can. Fun times, but 2spooky4me.
---
Yes the Railway 
---
When they sell it on the ATOMIC SHOP.
---
I think there is a consumable that gives you higher level lockpicking... there is a bobblehead for it, if I recall correctly.  
---
It would be cool if they would ease the fuck up off not being able to place camps in cities. 
---
I'm starting to get this picture in my mind that "scrapping" involves just bashing the rifle on a table until it is in pieces.
---
First option is worse. 
---
With the number of fires they're putting out, this might legitimately be Bethesda Austin working at full speed.
---
Thank you! I'm on my third attempt of completing this mission. I had just gotten to the glass cavern after 3 scorched beast attacks and no more time to play....I wasted over an hour fighting them. 
---
Are you sure they won't have a "perception" increase with level?
---
Were not dirty commies! 
---
Three of them together. Yeah. I remember being level 40 and having them spawn on me at a train station. They were relentless.
---
Great, now they're gonna get rid of that
---
Thanks for that, bookmarked. All looks green but I haven't been able to connect now for hours. 
---
I'm hoping that loosing my first ever PVP fight to a partly invisible TSE griefer hasn't gotten me banned by proxy :(
---
Scorchbeast: wings causes them to ground more often and they are weaker on the ground for some reason
---
Mirelurk Queen:  Nuke her
---
Yeah I first learned that Sorchbeasts could be in the rotation for enemies that attack your workshop when I was up at the ammo factory...alone...
---
:/
---
Go to their forum page and lok at the bottom.  It's under Support.
---
Another bad thing about them is that they still track you down even if you are hidden. Once I saw a scorchbeast and immediately crouched and hid in a shed. The entire time the status thingie (I don't know what it is called) was yellow, meaning the beast didn't know about me. But about 30 seconds later it turned to caution then danger. Then I got sonic blasted through the wall. There is pretty much no way to avoid them.
---
I know why some players do this in other games like WoW with highly developed endgame, and ARPGs like Diablo are hack'n'slash which is pretty much all about combat/leveling. So that totally makes sense. But Fallout 76 is not a traditional MMO and it's definitely not an ARPG. It really doesn't make sense to me to have 'reach 50' as a major goalpost.
---
And I'm not trying to claim through these insights that you can't play the game how you want... I just don't understand why you'd want to. You didn't want to go through the story, so why don't you just wander through the world and explore the many (I would guess going onto 300) locations as your leveling process? Are you just completely set on the most efficient and fastest possible way to 50? Cause that's not a goal I think many people share, and it's probably not a goal Bethesda will ever cater to in its games. They spend a lot of time and resources on developing environments, so I doubt they look sympathetically on players who want to basically skip all that in favour of powerleveling. xD
---
In my experience, players who rush content and power level are viewed as 'locusts'-- they move from game to game consuming everything as fast as possible. While that style works for some games we've both mentioned, it's really not what Fallout will ever be about, IMO, and I see no reason for most devs to cater to that playstyle because it trivializes what the devs do and is incredibly hard to service without nonstop content updates... which is kind of unreasonable both from a financial and development point of view.
---
Like the one up north overran by plant growth. Start there make it cool. 
---
lmao, no major companies are just going to hand out the contact details for either the chairman or managing director to some pissy little customer who is making an ass of themselves through online support as it is.
---
let me also chime in here. I really want to chnage the two shot explosive double barell to something like the deathclawerer, and my explosive scorched anti armour combat shoy gun to the scorcherer and my explosive two shot harpoon gun to fucked-up-this-time-didn't-ya-er-er.
---
Yes. I'll PM you it if you want.
---
Rifleman perks under perception are your best bet.
---
The entire game is broken.. WHO NERFS EXPLOSIVE GUNS BRO
---
Ritual mask, greaser jeans and jacket...
---
It’s the post apocalypse bro, it happens 🤷‍♂️ 
---
Odds are they've been looted by other players. You're better off taking a power plant workshop and making fusion cores yourself. They'll all be at 100% charge that way, too.
---
That rad damage... 
---
Please do. I'm lvl 265 and need a new end game
---
I'm playing on servers with 2-5 players a lot in the past 2 weeks. Certainly feels sparse. Rarely run into anyone outside of Whitesprings. 
---
Entropy is taking it's toll. Taking down servers starting in April?
---
I agree, but most people here are soft. 
---
Why not just take out travel cost?
---
The power of the All Rise corrupts even those at Bethesda...
---
All praise the ALL RISE!
---
It doesn't work lol. They nerfed it.
---
Name checks out.
---
No, I am not but I am level 159 and they are newly built and placed turrets.  When a mole rat is chewing on my corn or a mutant is taking pot shot at my generator 20 meters away I expect the damn turret to do something.  Not asking for a lot considering how much CAMP budget they consume. 
---
That guns damage look fairly poor. I'll have to check my own non legendary as well as normal black powder when i get off work, but I think even my black powder rifle does more damage.
---
If you purchased it via card I would just charge back at that point then and buy a pre owned version of the game for 10-20 bucks.
---
Bethesda are really trying to loose as many customers as they can aren't they :(
---
Defo try get in touch with a different GM / CM though, it seem's very strange.
---
If i didn’t have All Rise and Black Diamond, I wouldn’t have made it this far alive. It’s the only weapon I can depend on. 
---
So far my armor breaks down much slower and most is just modified by me. I haven’t crafted most of my armor. 
---
Very cool find. The Dunwich Building and Dunwich Borers where some of my favourite locations in the fallout games, loving the new Lovecraftian content in 76. Really hope they add more content down the road.
---
Well it's a lot for me
---
All they need to do is fix it so rifle perks work on it
---
Devs: We understand some of you are angry. Please take these 500 atoms for compensation. They're about what our game is worth.
---
Projectile hit boxes seem to be screwed at the moment. I've had several bullets just phase through my target since the last patch.
---
😂
---
How do you get your shotgun damage so high? My 3* TSE is at 195. 
---
( Queue Vault Tec video ) You are the future!
---
Never said the highest of the high but they could gonthe phone route and get way further up than simple emails
---
I actually enjoy the game and still play with over 300 plus hours but anyone has the right to complain to a company about bad practices 
---
Good find at a good lvl. 2shot dragon is great for 1shotting things, and lvl 35 makes lvling easier for that last stretch to 50.
---
I tried a friendly approach to the bullets in my face...
---
Nerf anything for the players but make the bosses buff. Oh yeah that’s smart. 
---
They may be working on it, I don't know. All I was saying is I haven't seen any official comment about it or mention of it.
---
Shouldn't matter. I built a piano out of pencils and clipboards and it works great.
---
&gt;If they actually succeeded in a proper deployment, what would have been?
---
A few days headstart on bug fixes?
---
I have a furious,  anti armor railway rifle just rusting away in my stash box waiting the day....
---
How about free fast travel, but you have to sit through a five minute cutscene of your character running a hand-crank cart. :D
---
The Free State movement is a gateway to Communism! I saw it on a poster, so it must be true!
---
Please record everything. I think this has potential.
---
Perhaps to your unsophisticated ear...
---
It would be very interesting, it would also be nice to see it in game aswell, when joining a server i would like to know where its based (ie gb or america or Australia) and what the ping is like because I presume they have dedicated servers for different locations around the world, if we had that information it would enable us to select a server where we would get the highest fps and the smoothest gameplay. 
---
I can assure you that its not the majority who are happy with the game. Clearly not. 
---
Just wait for survival servers, it’ll be fun! A bunch of assholes hunting each other 
---
I was doing the Defend The Abandoned Town event or whatever is  called near Watoga today when he showed up and helped me killing the scorched until the event was over, he didn't have anything interesting to sell though.
---
Was he carrying ruby slippers?
---
Your post its amazing! I have some info you may like. 
---
If you get all the lore from the terminals at vault 94 and then you read this letter found in Lucky hole mine...

Just follow the crumbles and let me known your opinion. 
---
Its seems like vault 94 is realted with the secrets of luchy hole mine.
---
Hopes its helps.
---
unfortunately i often get a bug that hides the workshop on the map, happens with my camp sometimes too, forcing me to fast travel to a nearby location that costs caps.
---
At level 4 you can just punch the locks off. 
---
Wondered about that! Thanks!
---
I found out that the studio behind the fallout game are a bit less experienced but very motivated. There is a lot to do and even more to fix. Either way, i hope that they find a middle ground between your ideas and some of the other players. 
---
Yes so much this. 
---
The armor you're wearing breaks 20, 40, or 60% slower.
---
It used to go up to 90% but they nerfed it. With White Knight x3 and Lucky Break x3 (random auto-repair) I can go a few days without repairing something.
---
Just a thought, maybe screen grab the message and stick it up on their twitter and facebook.
---
Bet you get it resolved within 24 hours :(
---
Everyone you've met in game agrees with you? How many people is that, since you haven't touched the game since launch week? While we're on the subject, your main felt too powerful, so you played your level 55 alt? How many hours, exactly, did you squeeze in in launch week?
---
lol I guess you're one of the Support Staff.... at least you commented back :)
---
This is very realistic. Machines can sometimes malfunction in real life, right? Well done Bethesda! Best game company ever!
---
Way ahead of you man.
---
I did stop playing, I'm enjoying battlefield V.  I did love fallout 76 but after time and time of baby I'm sorry I'm working on getting better, I had to eventually say know we're breaking up for real.

Bug: upon entering the game for the first time, on occasion my character will spawn in falling, I can see the game world above me and I appear to have fallen through it. A second later I will “land” in the world except the fall will have broken both my legs, or as it has just this moment, kill me.

Incase it’s location specific this is on the cliffs above the ransacked bunker to the right of Harper’s ferry

I left about a month ago popping in once or twice a week for a few minutes. 
---
Yeah, that homing ticket launcher isn't going to be as effective as you'd hold unfortunately. It's still going to miss a good half the time, not do as much damage as it should, and break after a handful of shots. I have an instigating quad barrel tracking one and I never even bother to use it because of how useless it is and how much missiles weigh.
---
Thanks. I will try that tonight. A sacrificial corn stalk out on a platform with a fire pit.  Like an offering to the mole rat gods
---
we need tiered levels of each turret that unlock based off of level or even plans we have to do missions for

I am going to build a bait house, with a cute little picket fence and a well-manicured lawn, to incite griefers so that they can be slain while distracted.

Well, I was making a 2nd account. I already finished the story on my main character. I admit I didn't 100% the game, but I enjoyed the main quest as much as I could. Now I just want to spec a perfectly made PVP character and harass people.
---
Thank you for the math. Given XP boosts being active at all times (team bonuses, well rested and food) pre-XP nerf on ghouls it begs the question how far it can actually be brought down.
---
No, I do not think so. The glassed cave has nothing to do with the final boss.
---
Another indication that this was deliberately done is the fact that the Adventure 200 years (1976) and Vault 76 (2076) were completed 300 years after the Declaration of Independence.
---
Another example is the labyrinth of shining that was deliberately built in and not because they thought "oh, we have a labyrinth, let's make a tribute to shining out of it"
---
The TSE nerf was the straw that broke it. They took it too far rather than reducing it a little. Things are too much of grind now. Now you need 4 times the bullets for nuking prime and very little chance of getting any reward. Everything is too much work for too little reward.
---
Bored people are running around destroying camps while trying to force PvP on people who don't want it which means there is no safe place to relax and chill. Why even put the effort into building a CAMP. A couple of super expensive plans wiped out my caps so now I mostly log in to get my daily 1400 caps
---
It's just depressing to play right now. 
---
This right here. Why can we even build turrets right out of the vault? They are such a sophisticated thing to know how to build by default (FO4 is guilty of this too). They should be locked behind a few combinations of perks and fewer kinds of turrets to choose from (who cares about a shotgun turret vs a laser turret??). Then we’d have to rely more on improvised traps and defenses. Heck, a trap that roots an enemy in place and could be repaired would be amazing. 
---
All that, plus black jack and hookers.  In fact, forget the game.
---
I think 90% of the programers for this game should be fired at this point lol
---
Cool mole miner ideas:
---
Make them go up to level 50(irritates me that mongrels get higher levels than the lads)
---
Friendly mole miners that can accompany us as porters, and we can arm them with a set of weapons (Assault rifles, miner claws, missile launchers)
---
To add on that:
---
Mole miner progression system: they fight better or make more pleasing sounding grunts as you do cool stuff, like kill SB’s or the SBQ, or salvage mining equipment.
---
Mole miner customization (Glowing boi or not?) Put glow colors or gear colors on them, once they reach a certain status with you
---
(To maintain balance) Are not truly killable, but can be killed off for an hour at a time.
---
Mole miners will generate a small amount of coal and black titanium in their inventory over time, rarely screws or springs
---
Make sad grunts whenever they see brethren fall, but will attack them if they are attacked (and it wouldn’t damage their status to you)
---
Level with the player in regards of health, cap at 100(So they can keep up with the player, but not become invincible after the player reaches stupidly high levels
---
This could honestly be a well implemented companion system without requiring any (serious) voice acting, and could salvage aspects of F4’s companion system.
---
At this point, slap damage from trolls are worse than medium range scorchbeasts... but the visuals hurt.
---
I'm usually afraid of mods, but this is beyond quality of life.
---
Ived had 4 spawn at a workshop just after I finished defending it.
---
Yes for the DLC where you have to use the timemachine near Watoga  to travel to pre-war West Virginia and try too prevent the Fallout. The story will be about uncovering a secret new world order cult that is behind the war.... That aside I would like to see a game that takes place before the war. Its such a interesting universe but we only get to see the world after the Fallout.
---
Lmao true
---
In another game I might actually spend some money on Atoms or whatever, but haven't at all in fo76. Mostly because I already paid like $30 too much for the game at launch and am never getting that back.
---
and just yesterday I ended up seeing my first fellow enclave member down there. 
---
I aim for the tail.
---
What's wrong with you mate? they said no, they answered your question, and when you started to whine, they told you to read the response previously given, which was you've downloaded the game, and are not eligible for a refund. 
---
Why aren't you eligible for said refund you ask?
---
because you downloaded the game and aren't eligible for one.
---
Stop harassing that person. 
---
I have not tried to set more then 3 suits out, but my first inclination is that there might be a cap to prevent PA spam.  If that is not the case, try roulette, just pace one in the stash and hope the one you want to work on is in the 3 remaining.
---
Thank you Kanye, very cool!
---
I just died for the 3rd fuckin time today lol, add me iXiledi I'll be back on in a bit
---
There will be about 4-8 of us. You can't stop us, unless you alt+f4 of course.

About a week ago a user demonstrated a temporary fix that makes it work as it should.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alq4su/the_assaultron_head_has_drained_all_my_fusion/effzvjn/
---
Should be noted that even working correctly it just isn't that good.  And you get a massive +49 rad hit for firing it fully charged.
---
Let's play r/outside! 
---
This guy was literally demanding contact info for the chairman and managing director though, not asking for a manager in the customer service department.
---
Google is your friend. Customer service does not need to give out anything that isn't publicly available.
---
It's government propaganda!
---
You are such an entitled prick.
---
They’re pretty useless. Whenever I launch a nuke. I immediately fast travel to the location.
---
Does anybody by chance happen to know the legality of this?
---
I mean, when purchasing any goods or services, refunds(or exchanges) from my understanding are required by most laws, right?
---
Refusal to send replacement(s) seems illegal.
---
I would absolutely prefer a finished product dlc for forty bucks over piecemeal, buggy, mini updates.
---
Hey, I just ran into this bug proper for the first time - and figured out what's going on. Enemies could see me from half-way across the map when I had Chameleon procced, but not when I didn't, and after a bit of fiddling around I realised I had RadWorms. Cured it, BAM, invisible once more.
---
TL;DR: It's an overflow bug. Our stealth is so high it's wrapping back around to nothing.
---
Some type of update the encourages more types of player camps.  I'd love to see bars, shops, player towns, etc.  Ones that could be publicly marked on the map.  That would make servers more unique.
---
it will serve you well at that level and you will likely shed a tear when you out level it :) get some feats in it(if you dont already )  and you'll be aces 
---
Nerfing everything equally to the ground isn't how you balance a fun game
---
It's not too useful, but getting the diamond help orient.  Could probably just use a recon gun, but with the heavy weapon weight reduction, even an empty launcher is one and a half pounds.
---
Yep.  
---
Lmao I'm level 78 
---
It appears to have been fixed because my armor takes many hours of gameplay to break again
---
SB werent that bad really until the TSE nerf. I was spec'd for auto rifles and had no problem with them up until that point. Once again they are too spongey and the risk vs. reward doesn't equal out. Game still needs some balance but it still has potential... Bethesda just needs to invest in some bug spray 🕷🕷🕷
---
Too chewy for my taste 
---
I like the way your not sceptical and actually realise that this is poor customer service but thanks for taking the time to read the thread!  
---
As you probably forgot after reading this,  I enjoy as stated in the comments, Playing Bethesda's Fallout 4 and Skyrim, fan of their work hence why I prepurchased and know if they released Fallout 5 i'd buy it, probably just not prepurchase this time.
---
Im only level 74 and I have run out of shit to do. 
---
I could farm caps or something and unlock the rest of the plans etc, but there are basically no quests left for me to inveat time into. 
---
All of the people I was playing with have left for other games. Kingdom hearts came out last week, Anthem is released in another 2 weeks.
---
I dont see there being a huge community on FO76 in a months time
---
...oh yeah sorry, mixed my words up. People dump armors, weapons and flux because the vendor hits their caps and dump ammo and plans because it's dead weight.
---
Its good. 1 rank in each of the rifleman perks, some other supporting perks, speed demon mutation and you're going to have a blast.  
---
Much discussed topic since the vendor update.
---
So far no answers found.  Not even sure if you can get BOS mods thru craft/scrapping.  I have pretty much everything except BOS and Pocketed/Deep Pocketed from Scrapping Combat armors so far.  Those three are taking forever to get.
---
Luckily for me I got BOS and Deep Pocketed mod plans for Torso before the patch.  Sticking with Studded Heavy Leather for my Limbs.
---
Probably raises hunger bar to full, it's pretty great. 
---
If you are not enjoying reading this sub right now... go read something else for a while
---
Pickup all your glass junk.  Bottles are everywhere.
---
So you have to keep the card equipped for your armor to break slower.   
---
Dude my buddy and I found a fissure site and decided to go for it for some xp. This cunt sonic screeched for ten minutes straight. She was a bitch to kill, got 600xp for it though!
---
I agree, population has been a bit lite. I myself am in the 'check back later to see if things are better' camp. This is complicated by the fact that there are a couple of other promising online RPG games launching pretty soon. If even one of those games are good/better, it may be a long time before returning to  Appalachia.
---
I'd tell them to arrange &amp; pay shipping themselves to have the faulty goods returned if they are so worried about it. 
---
Also depending on your country I would contact your consumer affairs with the mentioned email to determine your full rights in regards to the replacement.
---
Open workshop. Store. Replace. 
---
well I take it back , you will cry that you got it at that  level rather than a 50 :)  :p. I cant say much most of my legendary armor is still level 40 and I'm well past that level 
---
That sounds like you were encumbered 
---
Ahh, gambling! Another thing New Vegas did better!
---
Such a love/hate nowadays. Thanks man
---
When we get flying cars
---
As far as I know they stay as long as the retake the shop mission still active.
---
Prenerf was 850+
---
I didn't and I won't. I don't even know how long I will be playing this game anymore. 
---
I was wearing T-60 with a Rad-X (no hazmat)... barely took any Rad at all in nuke zone.
---
How much rads were you getting?
---
Just wasn’t specifically about what they’re working on, it’s about what their attention is on.
---
I wasn’t over encumbered. And dose the game stick you in an agro loop if you are over encumbered?
---
It's all good, I'm just having fun with it
---
I am most certainly in the same fuck scorchbeasts boat, however my solution to them comes in the form of the Enforcer perk, its fully maxed out and CRIPPLES EVERYTHING in one or two shots.  I have amassed around 800 shotgun rounds and once they show up I just blast away.  Hit them in the air and they land very quickly, then a few shots to the knees and face and they just sit there wheezing helplessly as I pound their face with my All Rise till they die and I can collect all that sweet sweet nothing.
---
username checks out
---
I want this too. I put a lot of thought into my character's name. Though I was pretty careful choosing my account name too knowing that character names weren't displayed yet.
---
Resorting to insults, always a good way to win an argument!  
---
Darkest Dungeon is always an option (rogue like, dungeon crawler, combined with a little bit of resource management: imagine Fire Emblem with it's perma death without the romance aspects). 
---
Another great dungeon crawler is Binding of Isaac: Rebirth.
---
In terms of games that are similar to Rimworld, check out Prison Architect and The Escapists.
---
It'd be really cool to use that time machine! And pre-war Fallout is an interest of mine too!
---
I've had 3 spawn at Train Stations before when fast traveling to sell stuff.
---
Ouch wow those were the days huh
---
You have 3 perk cards + armor that increases your locking picking skill by 1 (or a magazine)
---
i have a piece of armor that increases the lock picking sweet spot
---
Almost 2, after 2 mins I have to double up on RadAway... It becomes a pain.
---
i found him in toxic valley while going to the shooting range. he was on the road with this cow carrrying all his crap. maybe  fast travel to grafton station and head towards clarksburg. 
---
have you considered getting better at playing the game?
---
In the first building at whitesprings golf club there is a eating/bar room on the left as u go in the door. Wine bottles behind the bar. Cups and glasses everywhere too. 
---
I find them equally endearing and terrifying due to how easily they can sneak up behind you
---
Supreme loot.
---
Foolish, silly monster.
---
Okey, any examples of locations where are tons of them?
---
Thanks for this. I love it. 
---
Oh :D
---
I have been surprised to see a lot of low level players on PC lately as well. Not sure if they are new to the game or players starting over out of boredom. I usually seek them out and give them some stuff out of boredom.
---
it's not 100% but it seems like raider faction vendors tend to have weapons benches more often than responder faction vendors, though I think Charleston Station does have one.
---
someone gifted me the orange suit when i was low level a long time ago..i really want the plans..i rarely go to grafton..i should check
---
**WHEN** the game is stable enough to play again, and a reasonable way to respec perks and SPECIAL points is added that is in game and not the store, and **ONLY** as long as the store remains pay to win free, I would be willing to spend money on Atoms for a cosmetic cool enough to buy. A middle finger emote, a go to fucking hell emote (point down), and some naughty nightwear would all qualify as cool enough to spend money on for me. As it stands the game is rated M but caters to mostly childish cosmetics.
---
&gt; Better deals, better items (paints for ALL the PAs, or all weapons, etc), bigger camp budgets, some sort of ability to return to workshops you claimed after being disconnected, and being able to build closer to other players miiiiight get me to open my wallet, but really nothing feels worth real money in the shop.
---
^This
---
Your level won't represent their level. You need the home defense perk for better turrets. Try that out and let us know how it goes? Maybe update the OP body with your findings.
---
Here at vault tec, we know your hard work as red blooded American is hard work. Sometimes when exploring the new world you may come across new foes, that magically appear near other fellow vault dwellers. But fear not. With our new state of the art P.A.T.C.H system or PATRIOT AND TERCENTENARY COMBAT inHIHIBITOR. We work hard to ensure you and your family won’t be the next victims of the reality phasing ghouls. Now little Timmy can fire that rifle all day long without you worrying about all that damage 
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who immediately slaughters all the Brahmin whenever I'm there.
---
I'm also frustrated by that! The Dunwich Borers was my favorite part of Fallout 4, but there was so little about it...
---
do you need the WK equipped for your armor to breaker slower?  Or only need to have it equipped when making the repair for the armor to receive the durability buff? 
---
Theres an addon on Nexusmods called Perk Card Manager that gives you 8 slots to set perks to. You then can swap using that slots hotkey any time you want. Super handy.
---
Git gud, as in a good game. 
---
Home defense 3.  Science 2.  Trust me...I’ve tried them all.  It’s a common complaint, not just me
---
I cannot say for certain.  I never target it.  I just always have too much glass and throw it away.
---
Every town, every house, every bar, every station.  Bottles strewn everywhere.  A couple glass shards per bottle.  Tall glasses, shot glasses, etc. etc.  Kitchens full of bottles and glasses.
---
If it weren't for weapon scraps giving a bunch of steel each, glass would almost give Steel a run for it's money as far as most readily available scrap junk.
---
What the hell else is there to post? We've pretty much exhausted everything the game has to offer. Reposts tell me people are still attached to the game and hopeful for improvement. 
---
decent amount of soot flower around within range of the bloodleaf as well, for healing salve
---
Did the same thing with melee and then started a secondary build for heavy weapons, just so I could switch whenever I get bored of one shotting enemies. 
---
This is insane.
---
This is the main, penultimate enemy of the game. The most mechanically complex. This was supposed to feel exhilarating and epic, this was supposed to be the fallout equivalent of a dragon fight. It even triggers its own unique battle music.
---
But everybody hates it. The most upvoted thread on this subreddit right now is the community ripping on the most important enemy of the game. Imagine if dragons from sykrim got this much flak and nobody wanted to fight them. Nobody appreciates scorchbeasts.
---
If you fight a scorchbeast you spend more than half your time with your screen saturated white and you can't see anything. The epic battle music is drowned out by some ridiculous wail and weirdly flat but loud impact sound.
---
Making any kind of attack spam rapidly reduces its impact. Why do they spam their attack? It makes it seems so much less impactful. Especially when it's such a cinemtically intense one, with so much visual and audio FX. 
---
Spamming the attack has diminished the player's emotional response so much. They're just irritating and a nuisance.
---
If they attacked once every 10 seconds or so for vastly more damage you would appreciate the attack so much more, be forced to run for cover, and be given a chance to fight back and think about timing your attacks. Given the way damage resistances are calculated, the higher base damage would put higher armored characters on a more even footing with non-power armored players. It would've made so much more sense.
---
Instead they get stuck in loops of constantly spamming with perfect accuracy, without looking at you, through solid walls, and you are blind, deaf, and dumbfounded.
---
For all that they're made out to be, everybody hates that they are in this game. It's baffling, I can't believe this made it in and has gone untouched for months.
---
Okey! Gonna hunt for them ;)
---
Yep, same thing. Wearing an hazmat suit inside PA and still rads increase. I even equip ghoulish and rad resistance cards and still I need to use rad x and radaway. Its silly.
---
I know that was rhetorical, but it would make an interesting survival mode. ;)
---
Why?
---
Yep I can’t get the urban armor or under armor from the enclave now either.
---
I *literally* just posted something similar elsewhere. To save [a click](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/anrm7u/fuck_scorchbeasts_and_whoever_programmed_them/efvri8x/):
---
I posted a similar thing here as well, im only like mid 70's but quest wise ive all but run out. I have left the end quest open because I have killed the queen a few times and dont play consistently enough to be bothered gathering all the codes before weekky reset.
---
Like, what do I do now?
---
Do you really think they'd even bother implementing multiplayer into their engine if they were going to abandon t before or right after TES6?
---
That thing is here to stay, for TES6, Cyrodil 76, TES7 and Starfield.
---
Youll find lots of plastic and glasses at any of the schools in the game as well as any places large enough to have a cafeteria for their workers
---
Kk ^^
---
Check your status effects.  Do you have extra rad damage debuffs?  Also, it would be ridiculous if armor effects and power armor effects stacked. 
---
Beta days bug. Still not fixed. Astonishing.
---
After launching a few nukes a friend and myself went through the elevator and found out then. Cleaver bastards I say lol
---
I just assumed I needed the "plan" from somewhere. Can you just not grow them at all?
---
It's not really equipped when you enter the PA.  you're naked under there.
---
Yeah, I gave her the white hair after being stalked by 2 SB's when she was only around lvl 25. XD
---
Jeez, no wonder they’re ignoring you. This right here is why I couldn’t handle working in customer service, you say no and they just harass you over and over. 
---
Cut your losses and move on, you’re not going to get a refund by acting like that.
---
Again thanks for taking the time to read the full thread, if you notice i first did ask to speak to a manager.  I'm impressed that you comment thinking you have all the facts but then show up your ineptness

will answer when i get home and can tell ya special &amp; perks i run for it.

It is a good rp weapon because it requires tradeoffs, which makes it interesting and fun.
---
And it blows the hell out of stuff.
---
Here’s a little secret I learned and brought up awhile ago. The turrets don’t work unless you are around! They rarely do and if they really did work, why do you need to be around when you defend a settlement you took over to farm the materials? 
---
For an "MMO" (which I use lightly for fo76, that's not a lot at all
---
Now.  No, now.  Now.  Now.
---
Every time I see someone say it's too hard I remember my days playing Rust. Rust Island makes the wasteland look like happy fairy land.
---
Yes, they were also my favorite part! When I saw the Interloper, my brain immediately remembered the altar in F3 and the face in F4! I think it all leads to this!
---
Are they even out of the red yet? I'd imagine they lost a fortune with this one.
---
I get off work 12:30 mountain time. Which would be like 2:30 am your time.  Ill take it when i can meet up with you
---
Isn't excavator the least resistant of all the power armors?
---
I've seen him twice in the last couple weeks wandering by the Tyler County Dirt Track. I realize that's far from Watoga, but you can claim the workshop there for free fast traveling. When I play that workshop usually isn't claimed.
---
I recognized it before reading the title (mobile) and I've never been there. They really did do a phenomenal job with the world, have to at least give them that.
---
For me it was when I got to the command center of Alpha site after a protracted bout of exploration and combat only to have to abandon my progress because I needed to stop playing.  The frustration of losing all that time spent was enough to break my love of the game.  In the end the fallout franchise just wasn’t enough to keep me playing.  I envy those who are.  Maybe I’ll revisit it in the future, we’ll see if it’s even still around by then.  
---
I had a high level purple one attack me last night.  Had balls no running away.  It was a good fight.
---
People usually drop stuff at the overseers camp or at vendors. Check red tool boxes or trash cans.
---
If you need help I can make some supply drops requests and a couple events with you to help out.
---
Add me: paulofg1980, ps4 only
---
I have marsupial as well as egghead, and 3 ranks of class freak, and I used to run shielded vault suit underarmor for +2 int as well.
---
Welp, can Pacify Scotch beasts now. Not Tame. Two completely different things
---
Reasonable and fair point...  
---
Can't agree with them all, but see where your coming from.
---
All armor is unequiped when you enter power armor, so you're not wearing it as far as the game is concerned. This keeps things balanced, even if it isn't entirely logical, as stacking power armor and regular armor would be OP.
---
If you REALLY entered a Power Armor while wearing a Hazmat suit you'd get crushed like you were stuffed into a 'Several Days At Mr. Scary Bearies' animatronic frame. Just be happy they don't force you to take off your ar-  
---
Patch Notes: Added requirement for players to have to remove all armor and only wear base clothing when entering power armor.
---
it reduces the weight in your stash
---
I was really looking forward to private servers when the game launched. Given the amount of content, do you feel you would have enough to do on a private server?
---
Isn't it still a thing where if you're in power armor all your other armor has no effect what so ever?
---
Played around 30 mins today. 2 server crashes.
---
Oh, and please don't make it the last comment on the sub..   
---
Reasonable and well thought out points and counter points are in short supply...
---
The crop dust attack has been described as "PissMist"
---
sure PC IGN Ragatho 
---
&gt; irrelevant to Moeparkers point.
---
He wasn't even making a point it was just a comparison.  And my point was that it's two different situations since nerfing characters in Overwatch to be in line with other characters to achieve balance is fine but nerfing guns or perks to be in line with the other in 76 isn't since there's AI mobs to worry about that are already too spongey for all but melee or near-optimal ranged setups. Or do you actually think there's some big difference between nerfing an overpowered glass cannon hero vs buffing other heros tankiness or damage capability to match the OP heros level? The OP hero still gets brought down from their special spot above the others either way, you're just tricking yourself into obfuscating buff with good and nerf with bad.
---
Wendigos - shoot their legs, stagger them with a shotgun. When they finally sit down, you can kill them at your convenience.
---
Well then it should show that you are in just your whitey tighties and not your armour/hazmat suit when you enter the PA..
---
Elder Scrolls has taken long enough already, I’d rather they focused on that than worry about 76 if it really was a choice between the two.
---
They tried online and it didn’t go well, hopefully they realize they do better at single player and focus on that in the future
---
You might already have a bunch and not realize it, beer bottles are all over but they're not automatically scrapped because they're used in crafting (molotovs) so if you've just been scrapping all and dropping it in your stash without looking you might have a bunch. Just have to manually scrap them.
---
Not certain, will have to look into that, I hear friends complaining with their variety of armour aswell though.
---
Yes but you would be good in customer services, you read this complaint and commented :D
---
Well, I for one don't often have time for more than maybe an hour a day. And I still totally enjoy the game. 
---
 OK. My present guy was a plan whore. He was made to score plans and has done so. That involved a crap ton of circling the map visiting possible plan sources, not all vendors, and just constant fast travel was his life. He has been successful and we have everything we want.
---
 So burned out oh fast travel and just tired of that grind I decided to stop fast travel and just walk. Which is really great, I should have done this sooner.
---
 So today I got 60 Atoms but I did a quest that let me kill a Scrochbeast. She was peripheral to gathering Pumpkins but her Fissure is near by, and I 'have to' visit them.  ;) He walked from his place in the Mire to the Pumpkin Patch 'cause he loves Pumpkin Soup and is pissed he can't plant any.
---
 Its called RP eh'. Its an RPG in fact. ;)
---
I won't be up then, but I can hold for you so you can get it on the weekend.  If you find it somewhere it is no big deal, just trying to help you out.
---
There was only ever 32 per server. Thats the max. So the 100 plus is an exaggeration. 
---
If it’s by design that turrets only attack when we are present l then mobs should not be able to damage our camps while we are not there.  Not talking about settlements or workshops here. 
---
We completely removed the power armor feature from the game! We apologize for the inconvenience we have caused! XD
---
*derp* Ok, got it.
---
ffs yes but stick to single player (which is a mind blowing experience) as RDO is a shit show and a half... just as buggy as fo76 with a 1/10th the content. Honestly, I just started playing No Man's Sky while these two so called AAA titles get their collective shit together. I don't know about anyone else, but for me on my xbox it's the age of older titles reigning supreme when it comes to my valuable little gaming time.
---
I usually find home by sticking to the roads and not fast traveling 
---
Not certain, that's what some people are suggesting is in effect..

At least in previous games with molasses in winter style loot lag (and I don't mean the great molasses flood of 1919 in Boston) you KNEW where the corpse was without fail and KNEW there was loot. In this example it's the first month or two of retail of WoW on a over populated server... the level of uncertainty here is what's unnerving.
---
You might get booted from the game.
---
Or jumped by another scorchbeast while waiting.
---
Or just never see anything show up.
---
Not my idea of an end game experience.
---
While this makes them non-threatening you still have to kill them. They won't ever give up so you can't fast travel, the constant screeching and blinding makes it hard to fight anything else and it's kind of rude to trail a scorchbeast when meeting up with other players.
---
Melee is way overpowered, buffing other weapons to this level is just bonkers.
---
*"Yeeesss.. Feed me your rage. My nipples.. they thirst! Mmmm.. Rage.." - BGS Scorchbeast designer*
---
Oh yes there is. Kill a three star legendary and have it glitch into a floor or wall removing the body and loot!
---
Because if everything is as overpowered as melee, you might as well play another game.
---
You must be out of luck playing FO76 then
---
I read that last sentence in MODUS' voice.
---
And I'm still waiting for an ACG review. And probably a sale.
---
Yea... nuked sites are easily 1/3 of what they were before this patch.
---
I've learned to enjoy the taste of crow after recommending this train wreck to close friends and coworkers.
---
I think a level 50 wood or leather legendary is worse than nothing at all, it's like a slap in the face. 
---
This is what happens when you dump RPG features and replace them with looter shooter mechanics. 
---
i have only had one perfectly preserved pie in my tenure in fo76, i didnt know i wouldnt get another. 
---
Can we grief D?
---
Huh. You learn something new everyday
---
It's not grenades. I love grenades and they are working well.
---
Nope, that's definitely a thing that happens.
---
Yep. SB in a nut shell. No tactic whatsoever to taking then down outside of extreme cheese.
---
Who carries on in this manner? Abusive towards a customer service team that were nothing but polite and helpful, and then thinks it’s something you want to share with reddit, after you got the refund that you rudely demanded?
---
You need to take a long, hard look in the mirror, and think about what sort of person you want to be when you grow up. 
---
 No. I have Radioactive Pumpkin seeds from today, but I'm pretty sure I can't plant them either.
---
I didn't even think it won't be like everywhere else and your account name is only shamed in support tickets. 
---
https://bethesda.net/status
---
oh ouch, I have been hurted by a stranger on the interwebz.
---
Whatever shall I do?
---
You've got problems. You should get some professional help. You're life must be nothing but misery if you have this strong a need to attack people randomly.
---
I mean serious. You are one sick fucked up person.
---
The Whitespring station vendor has a bunch of beer/wine bottles behind him. Inside the Whitespring, there's a few nuka cola bottles in the pharmacy, and there's another bartender upstairs with more bottles, and maybe some glasses there and around the tables.
---
I’ve found numerous BOS plans in an open orange train car just west of the Watoga Train Station. Usually laying on top of a wooden box. Careful though because there’s usually Assaultrons close by.
---
I can help but it looks like I'm a little late hehe
---
Interesting, I’ve never heard of or experienced that bug. There are so many tho that I’m not surprised. 
---
&gt; They could make this game insanely profitable
---
At this point who would spend money on it? It goes for sale (80%+) on various sites and people still don't want it. 
---
The reputation damage has been done, this game is now a meme. 
---
This is an awesome find and some really great theories! Thank you for the read :)
---
Think it was meant to be lvl100+ running around.
---
This is meant to be a genuine question and to get a scale of how many people have truly left the game 
---
I found out because a lot of beta users were complaining about it.
---
It also markedly reduces repair costs.  You can equip it when repairing and then unequip it.  
---
You’ll miss out on the 60% durability buff but you can repair using a fraction of the materials costs.  
---
This happens to me every time i log in, i just stopped putting turrets on my base. 
---
I came across several three star legendary creatures and failed to get anything over a one star once. It's frustrating, but I was happy that I *at least* got a legendary off their body.
---
Failing to get a legendary has only happened to me a few times, but I do feel your pain OP.
---
Great!
---
^^^
---
Face and spouts for queen.  
---
Acceptable changes. We will also bring all of your outgoing damage to zero for balance. Enjoy your new walking/repairing simulator!

-Bethesda
---
&gt; Quick Tip. You can shoot its face and if you do enough limb damage they ~~stop screaming and land for my melee buddies~~ 
---
die.
---
Better tip.
---
Indeed it does.  One of my primary sources of income in the game. 
---
Penultimate is second to last.  Sounds like you mean ultimate.  
---
Repair it with weapon artisan
---
This can't be real...
---
I wore the spacesuit and helmet with the deathclaw gauntlet for a while.  Kinda 60s planet of the apes....
---
Probably, but I like the idea of making my own rather than finding it
---
Ah i c. Ok
---
I'll take three scorchbeasts over four waves of bloatflies that may or may not even spawn.
---
Where are any of us? Like, what is even real?
---
It unequips as you enter. Check your inventory, it should be unequipped.
---
This needs another option; Waiting on updates
---
Well, that's realism for you. Good job, Beth!
---
There are no derps in shenanigans.
---
Off the top of my head you should be able to get to 42 charisma 
---
a full suit of unyielding is +15 (5 pieces at +3 each) then you can take day tripper for +3 and eat a sweet roll for +3 and then you can take that charisma perk for +6 when you have a full team so 27 + your base 15
---
????
---
Now what's the boggle?
---
mentats are +int unless you mean grape
---
Haven't seen any god modes, am on PS4. You sure it's not a Bloody Sentinel Unyielding build?
---
A majority of the playerbase is over level 100. This would be more of a dickpunch, and the people who left the game with the last patch (a lot lol) will just say “Yea, I have no reason to come back, I’ll have to start all over.”
---
Wiping everything is simply desperation. I’m sorry you weren’t able to capitalize on the influx of TSE Weapons or good armor, but that’s a you problem.
---
Your rant here, and your 1000 words of likely the same content are going to communicate one thing:
---
“You need to fix it, it’s bad”
---
That translates to them,
---
“We should cut our losses and abandon the game (76), we see no more money potential for the effort we must put in to develop it, if people hate it so much”
---
And,
---
“Nobody likes fallout I guess”
---
Meaning:
---
Your paper will be either disregarded or spun to mean the exact opposite of what you hope to achieve. Ultimatums never end well.
---
Aka godmode
---
Yup XBox here too and my Servers are full! I recall though that you don't see other player's dots if they're in Stealth
---
Now we just need to nuke it.
---
Oh boy. More crybaby threads. Reddit truly is a place for all the kiddies to meet online.
---
Well obviously, overpowering everything to the same level isn't how you balance either
---
I was honestly so stoked to play the game after seeing that first trailer with country roads in the back ground and thinking yeah playing with my buddies rebuilding the wasteland, but thing is that we aren’t, we are building random single dwellings and yes it may come later or maybe they spent all their budget on the licence for the beach boys song
---
Not the same, it can be countered supposedly. High stagger with headshots
---
try dropping the frame, it will place it in front of you. Make sure you don't glitch or anything. Someone can steal it if they enter first too. be careful
---
Im just taking a very short breather from the remake of Resident Evil 2 (which is fucking amazing by the way) to glance at the evolving meme that is Bethesda/Fallout 76, then Im getting straight back into RE2. Whats this about playing another game?
---
Same thing happened to me at Spruce Knob. It was so unbelievable and frustrating at the same time.
---
I also would like to know the issue
---
You want to enable pvp in specific areas?  It is.. in workshops.  Thats why you could do damage to enemies and their structures with pacifist on.
---
Yeah I’m waiting as well. Sometimes I think about the fun I could be having, or the builds I could try, but then I remember how much upkeep this game requires, and all I really do is grind for legendaries at this point anyway.
---
The requested url was not found .... camp lost

My suburban homemaker character would remove her bloodied powerfist from her designer purse, delicately place it on her manicured hand, and send you to the afterlife.   Afterwards she would eat your corpse, taking due care not to spatter her sequined dress.  She won’t bother repairing her camp—she’ll get some guy to do that for her.   
---
See you in Appalachia! - Guyb9 on xbox
---
Damn didn’t think of that one! 
---
I'm not attacking you? Most people say the game isn't fun.
---
Watoga and Harper's Ferry vendor bots for the heavy plans.
---
yep...this happened to me last night.. i was so excited to see the 3 stars.....plink plink pow....then nothing :(
---
That bug with the non-stopping fire breathing attack should be butchered ASAP, it’s way too unfair to go up against and the fact that scortchbeasts need to land a lot more; they’re the most unbalanced enemy in the game, right next to the scortched themselves.
---
Yes I am
---
Same reason ultracite mods are not at vendors. Rare in comparison 
---
Can I have a pack mule instead of the pony?
---
Still trying to farm Gauss rifles but no obvious place to get them on a regular drop, currently got the plans from The Whitespring Bunker, command centre so building and scrapping for mods. quite a long process though.
---
Nice! Thanks for sharing.
---
From Australia here and can say I'm impressed with that image making me think of f76 too.
---
I have hit nearly every bug on this list. Now I'm stuck at infinate sign in screen (PS4). I'm trying Bethesda. Really.
---
Tyvm!
---
Assaultrons are like the only thing that it's a bad idea to shoot in the head. 
---
BOS mod plans were at Grafton station from server hopping. Not sure about now after the update as I haven’t seen them since then. 
---
Mind:*Blown.*
---
Any online poll that allows people to vent or show their frustration will be heavily skewed by trolls. The only people who knows the numbers of players who quit is Bethesda, and they're not saying anything. It's why the 'I quit' posts don't really show Bethesda anything, they already know if people quit playing, and they didn't add anything besides what complaints were already telling them
---
hide under the overpass and try to take them one at a time, prepare for the leather leg and other shit loot for your hundreds of rounds of ammo and half hour of playing time.
---
well that wouldn't be wrong seeing as there's still the queen.
---
You might consider flagging your title with Spoiler, since newer players have not done this yet.
---
Anthem has a [roadmap](https://old.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/anu24f/postlaunch_roadmap/) of content they're planning to release after launch. They have a roadmap before launch. It's been 3 months. Where's the roadmap for Fallout 76?
---
Bethesda, you oughta just delete the scorchbeast permanently
---
That's cause you are role-playing the stormtrooper character. 
---
Windigos in the Golf Clubhouse. Server hop and you should be good!
---
Look guys I love fallout, but I'm a father of two and I work 50hrs a week, I dont get many chances to play especially dont have time to grind a game for the few essentials I need to make it more enjoyable 
---
Any max build is seen as god mode. Get good, uninstall. Your choice. 
---
I tagged it with Spoiler but forgot to flag it with Spoiler, thanks for reminding me!
---
Its sad that this seven has to be said. lol 
---
That should work. Google shared images are usually not a problem, I've posted lots.
---
Could you please expand on why you think that.  I'm wildly curious about your rationale here.
---
Suggestion:
---
Turning on Pacifist unlocks a secondary option to remove you from the map to all non-friends.
---
you can't wear them both. one or the other, bud. Nuke zones are supposed to be hazardous. 
---
I appreciate it but I'm on xbox, thanks for your feedback!
---
There’s a few examples in FO76 where it seems the designers don’t actually know how to make games properly. There’s too many examples of “Hah! Deal with *this*!” 
---
Happy cake day!
---
Cool I'll check it out
---
Thank you for the reply, you're awesome!!!!! =]]]]]]]]]]]]]
---
I have no idea, but happy cake day!
---
[Anthem also has a roadmap](https://old.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/anu24f/postlaunch_roadmap/) and it hasn't even launched yet.
---
It can be countered easily with rad shocks from a Radium Rifle. Always carry one in your inventory.
---
Thats just saying you need to get better weapons 
---
Thanks! Updated. Happy cake day!
---
We understand your frustration and we will pass on this information.
---
Large Doughnut unarmed weapons
---
For some people I probably seem invincible. For others I get one shotted. Just depends on the situation.
---
I chose quit, but I'm really just waiting for new content/updates. I haven't logged in for a week, where before I was playing several hours a day. I burned through the content and want some more.
---
Her chest is intentionally distracting.
---
Context...
---
Queens have spouts?
---
You didn't have to log out. Putting them in your stash is what did the trick. This has been a minor bug long before the most recent patch. If some of your supplies are on you and some of the supplies are in your stash, the menu will say you have all necessary ingredients but the crafting system doesn't recognize this as true. It wants all the materials in one place.  So you either need everything required in the stash or everything required on your person inventory.
---
It's a video game, for $60 or even less for most people, 300+ hours is a good value, period.
---
It seems in general now finds armor mod plans is feast or famine, depending on what you're looking for. 
---
More on the dl nerfs, then they will introduce more game breaking bugs
---
Damn, you can one hit those? I remember getting it full on with an instigating explosive double barrel with all the appropriate perks and barely denting it. It always annoyed me you would do 5% damage to it, then it healed back 4% and took a lot of hits.
---
In context to my comment to tokesone9, do you have all of your resources in one place? For example, you can't have lead in your stash and steel on your person.  The crafting mechanic wants them to be all in one place.
---
Because you touch yourself at night. 
---
In fairness, none of those games you listed were even 1/4th of the shitstorm this game / Bethesda has been since release. 
---
I usually play a few hours a day and so far the player base on each server has been roughly the same for me. 
---
The future starts with *YOU*.
---
That said, if you are simple-minded, old, or irradiated in such a way that the future should *not* start with you, please return to your primitive tribe and send back someone better qualified for testing.
---
Thanks for the warning 
---
I never could get the hang of Thursdays....
---
Fantastic quote.
---
Yeah this is true, but also take in account that a lot of Sentinel builds use dodgy, which cause a % of damage to not be taken at the cost of AP. If the opponent in sentinel build runs out of AP from all the shooting (A AAE or BE [50. cal](https://50.cal) makes it short work), they will have a windows where real damage that can be dealt. Yes the 8% less from the armour will just make it right, but in some case it's actually good to intimidate the user, sorta heavy barrage them. I've been testing a lot of Sentinel combos such as zealot, assassin and other enemy/player reduction armour, and there has been cases where it was instead of a fight scene, it was a flight scene.
---
On the note of the armour piercing, what it does is that it breaks down the armours durability, with the nerf of white knight card, a sentinel set needs to be repaired a lot and with perks that increase armour penetration, depending on the armour, sometimes it doesn't last as long.
---
Gamma is also just a good way to get down any build because since it increases rads, the person either has to break it and run or chug a lot of radaway and rad-x, which would then make mutations such as adrenal reaction not take place since their health will most likely top over the 20% that most people aim to be under.
---
The only way to really mitigate the damage done to a sentinel assassin is either via a stagger (as mentioned), or doing vat crits and other ways to boost your own overall damage, hence the big aim for BE weapons, since a normal Bloodied weapon actually tops over a TSE weapon(My TSE The dragon does less damage than my Bloodied The Dragon nearly most of the time). Though one thing to note is that along with the sentinel assassin build, some may introduce the fireproof perk and grounded mutation, to decrease energy and explosive damage (A scorchbeasts sonic blast only tickles me, the only threat I have is contracting The Blight due to it removes points from agility and strength, lowering the DMG resist and melee strength plus weight capacity and AP points).
---
A side note is that since most builds will be under the 100% health, Instigating weapons won't do anything extra to the opponent, so Bloodied is for damage and Anti-Armour just to shred that armour. An AAE Handmade won't do superior damage(not oneshotting many enemies yet having Demo Expert maxed, all the rifleman cards maxed, Nerd Rage maxed, Adrenal Reaction constantly on etc.), but its tactic is that the AA part is to break down their armour, while also then having the explosive effect to stagger, and when a stagger does occur, that's when it gets real. The auto mod for a handmade is to more so deliver the punch of the explosive when a stagger occurs (But due to the best armour piercing mag(for me, not sure if there is one more tier up) is like 10 bullets capacity, going auto isn't advisable).
---
When you mentioned a mini nuke at the beggining, that isn't enough for starters. I've seen pure builds where they take no effect, no stagger from a mini nuke to the face, due to them investing in a pure build that is very hard to obtain without sacrificing perks to increase weapon damage, and with the nerf of grenades, best ones I've tested to invest in are the pumpkin grenades(for the rads) and the pulse and plasma grenades (or mines) for the electrical/energy damage, since most people don't go for the grounded mutation.
---
Melee in this case is a broken argument. Due to exploit in the damage done, if you don't have a very stern build, a melee can still one hit kill. I have been trying to see if limb damage can have any impact on a sentinel assassin, but so far I don't have much info on that.
---
It’s Ma’am!!!!
---
You got a key card?
---
Yea I googled it. I dont remember that stuff anymore. M203 is about 3 lbs tho
---
Didn't know about this bug, it used up all of my 1500 cells... At least scrapping the head gives screws... Or was it springs? Either way, now i'm scrapping them with every chance i get.
---
It sounds like you're aware of this but in case you or the other two people reading this deep into the comments, junk isn't worth anything unless bulked, which gives it value for trading
---
No I was at the golf course 
---
PvE godmode atleast. Sorry I have a hard time thinking of PvP in this game because it’s dumb 
---
Thanks! I'll check it out. 
---
Tails for deathclaws. It cripples them bad
---
Yea I was trying to get around all that, which clearly backfired. But you can one-shot almost anything with the right bloodied weapons and no hp
---
Good to know I'm not the only one having a tough time finding them. Thanks for the info. 
---
I hate EA.  
---
Do mobs spawn at your camp when you aren't around? hTe only time my camp gets attacked is when I'm there.
---
Yeah, because fallout games are meant to funnel you into using the same build as everyone else /s
---
No, but I'd really like to know how they got those foundation pieces into the water next to the acid extractor there. Tried setting up a camp there before and ran into all kinds of placement issues because of the water.
---
Yeah I do and I have a Anti-Armor Gamma Gun. I need some good mods for it though to boost the damage up higher.
---
FYI, the issues and feedback thread (pinned to the front page of this sub) is a better place for this stuff...assuming it’s Bethesda that you want to alert to it. 
---
Get Starched Genes 2?
---
It is really easy to run out of quests.  The events are repetitive and, for a world as huge as the one they created, there is remarkably little to do.  I've been trying to keep an optimistic viewpoint on fo76, but its becoming more difficult each time I log on. 
---
There's a reason why so many games have over-priced items. These items are not meant for the average player. They are not designed to encourage sales from as many players as possible. They are setup to cater specifically to those who have huge amounts of disposable income and nothing to do with it.
---
A small number of wealthy people will spend so much money in the game that it doesn't matter that there's a small number of them. If you sell items at 50 Atoms and 10,000 people buy an average of two items, then you've made 1 million Atoms. If you price them at 2,000 Atoms and only 200 people buy an average of 5 items, then you've made 2 million Atoms.
---
If you are an average player with a limited amount of spendable income, then you not only don't matter to them, but it's in their best interest to make sure you never matter for the sake of profits.
---
When you see a sale on items, it's because that small number of wealthy people have bought what they're going to buy. The price drop is temporary so they can try and scoop up lower income people with the sale, but then the price has to go back up to catch new wealthy players that haven't shopped in the store yet.
---
I switched from it to the X-01 for that reason - The 100 pounds of extra carrying is less important as you get later in the game and learn where all of the shared caches are to dump junk, and I prefer the extra radiation and damage resistance. 
---
Thanks for the link, I'll save it for future use.
---
Happens too much.  My last queen battle ended in no loot at all
---
I'd have loved to seen the pic. Unfortunately, the links to a page 404 error. :(
---
With Hard Barter R3 - Charisma cost reduction effects max out at 20. So having 21+ CHR won't lower their costs further or raise the price of items you sell.
---
I tried with a 15CHR base + 15CHR from unyeilding set, +2 from herd mentality mutation and +5 from grape mentats and +3 from sweet roll, price didnt change past 20CHR
---
Born to be kings 
---
It's been there since beta.
---
Well take into consideration that vendors only hold 200 caps and you have to wait 24 hours for it to reset (or something along that time frame)
---
Fuck Fallout 76 and whoever made it
---
Except, you know, in the real world and not in your imagined herd mentality one, they just buffed fireproof, not nerfed it. 
---
But don’t let facts get in your way. 
---
Caison :)
---
I think that’s the issue. The sandbox is inherently unbalanced for PVP but balancing it would be boring AF. I don’t really worry about it, I just jump servers if some try hard is being a douche. 
---
I remember going to Sons Of Dane for the one of the quests rose gives you. I was streaming, and this level 80ish charred ghoul one shots me and chases me for about 10 minutes. I was only level 9ish.
---
personally i would like to see under armor (example, shielded vault suits) work properly when in power armor, allowing their effects to work through it. 
---
I'm 2 perk cards away from feeling like my current character's done, a 15-strength twisted-muscles grounded speed-demon marsupial with a walking cane and a western revolver, level 85 or so. My gear's not the best, but I haven't found any better pieces in a couple weeks and everything's feeling pretty easy and routine.
---
I might attempt a non-melee chameleon build on my next character.
---
Upcoming ESO updates will probably pull me away until the first 76 DLC comes out.
---
What do ya mean?
---
I agree. They made it too fast as well. It only has about 300 hours of "real" content. The only stuff I don't have is all the plans. But what do I need all the plans for? Do I really need plans for things I won't use? No. With Fallout for, there was enough to keep you busy until the DLC (for the most part). But this just has busy work. Especially for the challenges. They geared many challenges on playing every build type. But I have always favored energy weapons. I don't want to play unarmed, melee, explosives etc. However, to complete the challenges (effectively) I would need to. It needs a big evolution in style/gameplay to really bring it back.
---
Why wood they be on the legendary drop list in the first place wood be my question? 
---
I ran into those fuckers last night! And there were literally three of them right next to each other. I thought it was a fucking glitch.
---
Check out market76
---
Do you like to stroll around as wanted? Thats where the problem is..... Untill they hit you (One shot you) you cant damage them. I love to have gunfights but melee ruins being wanted.
---
Maybe... You got the code?
---
They don't help much.
---
This is strange. One guy can see the image and I've posted many, so I dunno. I get the same url if I do shared link at Google Drive again.
---
Been there forever 
---
4 of us was attacking him, because he kept killing me. He didn't take any damage whatsoever 
---
Sssssshhhhhh...please. That's the easy part. It's posted online every week.
---
What about eyebots? I gotta know how to fight off eyebots 
---
How about Dense, on the Combat Armor?
---
4 of us was attacking him. He took no damage whatsoever.
---
This makes more sense than most posts with "ways to save the game" 
---
Clearly you have zero idea how buggy code works.
---
4 of us attacked him, he took no damage whatsoever 
---
between Med-X, a piece of Vanguard and a piece of auto stim they only get that one hit in (nearly killing me) then i sprint away and pop em a few times in the head.
---
i spend a bit of time wanted, not a ton but a little bit.
---
 That is a bit strange, I could not figuer out what he was extracting so I went up to it and I dunno how he got it there.
---
Works fine for me
---
Good thing those 2 are avaliable to everyone :D
---
Except, you know, nobody said fireproof was nerfed. It was just a joke about the other nerfs, such as White Knight.
---
But don't let reading comprehension get in your way.
---
I'm referring to the bugged Rad Worms since the new patch. 
---
That is awesome, you should go on a hike and take comparative photos lol 
---
Unless it changed recently, yes.  I swapped out the perk that lets you target body parts a couple patches ago but can re check in a couple days
---
was that confirmation that it worked? or that you were going to confirm it worked?
---
I drink from the Whitespring sulfur fountain (about 100 feet from the golf club where I usually get Rad Worms). My mutations seem to all continue to work.
---
Even if Food was list at the top of the list and Chems after or reverse, just food or chems listed together not jumbled up in a hot mess!
---
I kind of assumed that was eventually going to be implemented, theres a terminal at each station to check your ticket (or whatever it says). Of course, they all say "all systems offline"
---
I think they patched it, but there was a big that made it so doing enough damage just negates the damage.
---
Hey,
---
First time poster on this subreddit and I don't look often so apologies if this has been said before. I found the plans for a BOS chest piece yesterday in the Eastern Regional Penitentiary, incase anyone else hasn't noticed armor plans always spawn on the armor bench in here but seem to meld into the table so you have to fiddle around a little to pick them up.
---
Never worked for me either \[PC\]
---
 I wrote a fucking youtube back when there was nothing but 28.8 modems. Kinda dumb really, but a really interesting exercise in mashing Perl and PHP together. :)
---
 No I know fuck all. ;)
---
Yeah you can stack a lot of damage reduction but the largest part of it is very situational. He would have to be standing still for Sentinel. Also Serendipity if he has a low health build. That will be 0 damage too.
---
Random as far as I know. I had a while of trying to get the Responder vendor bot in Charleston.  He would be one of the random characters.  
---
All I do in this game is kill other players or farm for materials to use to kill other players.
---
Yup.  I'm a member but what I'm saying is it would be nice if you didn't have to go through a different source.  I mean, I get a legendary I want to sell.  But to do that I need to jump on either discord or a subreddit, post it, and meet someone.  In ESO, you just go to your guild trader, post it, and keep playing the game.  When I'm playing, I just want to play.  Not have to outsource to sale something.  The bazaar is the closest thing but I've literally sold 3\* legendary weapons to railroad stations because it's quicker then the bazaar.  Of course, I make 1% of what I would on the bazaar lol.

---
Any chance you might share your Rifleman build I wouldn't mind seeing it
---
Quit yer yapping and get me another beer. I need to wash down these pretzels.
---
Be careful. Next thing you know, someone will see this and complain that Bethesda added an update without telling us every change made in the last patch. 😆
---
Have you got Shielded Raider or Casual underarmor linings, Vault-Tec Jumpsuit or Vault-Tec University Jumpsuit plans? I wouldn't mind looking at screenshots of all your plans if you've got an album.
---
Woooo! 
---
im still not bored with the whitepsring golf club
---
You can have lead by large amounts when hitting gyms, steel is not found on large quantities. I have to massacre super mutants or scorched for their weapons.
---
Yeah that's the problem. They work too well and then don't work at all (depending on the mutation) when Rad Worms is cured. 
---
This happened to me twice and both times I was able to resolve it by manually scrapping everything and then moving my camp one more time and it reset to 0. Super frustrating to lose all of my materials but it about doubled my budget so worth it.
---
You know you could get one in Fallout...
---
You know what, never mind. You enjoy the heck out of that pie!
---
You still have sentinel assassin for sale? Nevermind, i haven't logged in a few days and probably will log a little during the weekend
---
No, but I keep accidentally hitting Y and repairing trash guns instead of scrapping them in the modify window. 
---
I won’t lie, when I realised it had actually picked it up I may have let out a slight squeal.
---
Vendor Busy in Bunkers - Checked this with a few players and no one was using the vendors and the screen says they are busy as if someone was using it. 
---
It's an MMORPG... People gunna kill you. It sucks but don't blame people for playing how they want to play, blame Bethesda for making this online instead of creating actual Fallout. 
---
At this point I want to keep it forever and never eat it.
---
How does Lucky Break interact with White Knight?  If armor has been "over-repaired" by White Knight, does Lucky Break add onto that?
---
That title... Sounds like a wild Friday night.
---
Yep. Frantic rad away attempt and there goes my bloodied 10mm.  I knew right then and there, but the real scare was wondering if my bag was gonna be at my feet or not. 
---
It all worked out but now I leave my inventory tab on aid or holo etc. 
---
Such sweet memories!
---
I still miss mister ghoul sometimes.
---
I have this problem of xbox I also like to know a fix to this 
---
Nobody has made a big iron joke yet. I'm disappointed in you all. 
---
I have the same problem, all of a sudden jumping like a lame duck.
---
Can you add things like plain ol' heavy metal limbs or robot limbs?  I've been looking for those forever and can't seem to find them anywhere.
---
I have not seen Dense Combat Torso anywhere since the patch.  Fortunately, I got before the patch.  
---
If you are on xb1 I'd be happy to mod you're combat torso if you need.
---
Same but I was in the mire. 3 beasts spam attacking me with their glitchy sonic attacks, broke my excavator legs so I was overweight. Slowly walking towards a building for cover and went through hundreds of stimpaks trying to survive. Over 1k 5.56 fires an I didn’t even kill one because I couldn’t see anything and everything was shaking. They’re fucking stupid.
---
Good idea. Wish I could lock weapons down to prevent dropping or scrapping. I can’t seem to stop picking things up despite not needing them so I’m dropping stuff a lot.
---
Ha! I have one in my stash too. It's the one thing I'll never dump for stash weight.
---
I guess i need to play with chems more.   I run full sentinal assasin, dodgy, seridipity etc etc and i can get one hit easy. I gave my buddy a grog axe and he can pull 1300 damage out of it. It one hits me everytime.
---
I keep rad be gone in my quick wheel for that exact reason. 
---
Yeah you just have to relog, thankfully. It does get tedious.
---
Not sure why you got a downvotes they were LITERALLY copy pasted. Have an upvote.
---

This has been happening much more since the last patch. I too will miss &gt;90% in quick succession.

I just found an article that says the opposite.. that the bowler is the one that works, and bowler hat does not?
---
I'm on PC, but thanks for the offer!
---
This thread is pure gold.
---
The protectrons take a lot of damage if you shoot the black (spring?) like plasticy thing between the torso and legs
---
You can lay a wood foundation into the water, then snap a concrete onto it. Not my camp, but same location.
---
They literally are. There’s even comments in the code referring to specific types of dragons like the ancient dragon, named dragons, etc. It’s copy pasted.
---
What doesn't make sense is that turrets worked very well in Fallout 4 - they picked up enemies and started shooting right away.
---
Thanks! 😄 I guess people just can’t handle the truth.
---
Mind blown. 
---
You weirdos who spill toxic cynicism in your own living room (and get 500 upvoters circle-jerk you) must live in a true parallel universe. 
---
Someone constructively offered “Try the fireproof perk - sonic attacks are energy and explosive. They only tickle me”. 
---
To which **you** cynically replied: 
---
Bethesda: something that gives an advantage? Better nerf it”. 
---
And now you are saying nobody was suggesting they would nerf fireproof? 
---
I understand your frustration and i will pass this information to the devs.
---
This happened to me once too. The Red Rocket workshop up north. I had just claimed the workshop when the defend event started. 3 of those bastards came swarming and just as I was about to leave the server I saw a dude building his camp next to me, he was 40 levels below me. We ended up killing the Scorchbeasts, but at what cost?
---
Sweet, myself and 3 other of my friends bought the game the day it came out and just a few weeks later they all stopped playing it. Now I play alone or with random people I find but I still miss playing with my buddies.
---
All I can say is it better damn well be fixed in the next patch.
---
Fallout 76. The fuck are you playing? Unless you’re using third party cheating software or mods to remove the sonic visuals, the shaking and the stupid damage, you’re playing a different game or lying.
---
It's kind of a joke that the games big baddy scortchbeasts are supposed to be the goal to kill, but don't give good enough loot to make it worth the loss of ammo and stims... I don't even bother outside of nuke zones.
---
Once
---
chems AND food. I play as a glass canon- high P &amp; A, totally rifle focused. chems help get P&amp;A even higher for me and foods and chems boost me Endurance (and a touch of Strength). i always have mutfruit juice, gourd soup, med-x, psychotats, bufftats, buffout etc. and i can generally keep myself alive.
---
i dont have Fireproof Perk yet so TSE guns get me in 2 shots everytime. i havent been one-shot killed in awhile.
---
Thanks.  Wasn’t sure that about one either.  Have not used it yet.  
---
Yep. Also by watching my weight go down when I craft ammo since gunpowder’s always in my inventory
---
I more than agree with your post. Had the same issue with a scorched Beast two days ago would not stop the Sonic attack for at least 5 minutes consecutively. Fortunately I have the Whisperer perk and the other one which allows you to pacify beasts. I highly recommend it.
---
And move yer head out of the way of the TV. With your giant cranium. 
---
I bet this guy is behind the idiotic gamepedia edits. 
---
Now to grind for the flyby random encounter and see if they broke the game. 
---
This is what survival should be! New characters only and no legendaries
---
Not yet. Not like pressing 'Q' in Minecraft or Starbound (throws equipped item).
---
What I often do drop/transfer by accident is a holotape at the top of my inventory titled "that boy" (quotes included, which is why it sorts to the top). I hate that holotape, but since it's saved me from dropping more valuable items countless times, I pick it up again, which causes it to autoplay again.
---
my build is 6, 15, 6, 4, 7, 15, 3 . and i tend to not suffer from very much one-shot anymore. a close TSE lever rifle can probably still one-shot me with the build and stack. im just unsure what exploits may be used by opponents.

He's not interested in discussion, just making his point.

They aren’t refusing to send the replacement.  Most companies now require proof the you got rid of the original product to ensure that you aren’t just trying to get another one for free from them while keeping the original.  Also if you were to send in the broken one they would probably just toss it themselves so it’s cheaper and more efficient to just have the customer prove that they destroyed the original and then send out a replacement 
---
Means you didn’t tag her successfully (for whatever reason). The harpoons are from someone in the battle who was shooting a harpoon gun with a flechette mod at her.

Upvote for showing me the subreddit I should be a part of for less drama and more enjoyment.  :)
---
This is me too. Honestly I played a lot, I certainly got my money's worth and do not regret the decision of buying. There's just not anything to do beyond exploring the already explored and doing random side quests that don't really interest me, like with many MMO side quests.
---
And honestly the TES nerf patch did not bother me really. 
---
I was just burnt out. I'll be back when there's fun content to explore again. 
---
Equipping 3 rifleman at 1 perk each gives you 30% plus damage... This only takes 3 points. 6 more points gives you 60% plus damage. 9 total points for 60% more damage... Its excessive. I freed up so many points equipping lvl. 1 perks for my weapons with very little difference in the weapons performance. Now, I get to use some other perks I wouldve never used before. I will snap a photo later and try to post. Thanks. 
---
TIL.  thank you very much.  
---
That's a pretty honest and fair question.
---
For my part... I'd like to see maybe... players actually roleplaying as a raider?  Perhaps using armor and weapon choices that aren't BIS meta but based around Raider aesthetics.  Pipe weapons, chem junkie legendaries, Raider PA (it's actually not bad, stays competitive if overrepaired).
---
In addition I'd like to see more interaction, something the other side can react to and respond back-and-forth with.  If you want to steal or extort as a Raider, give some banter, some dialogue, maybe even an outcome that doesn't have to result in PK-ing.  Maybe you find someone funny and they make you laugh.  Maybe you enslave someone as your valet for a day- ala the Dread Pirate Roberts.  Listen to these two Fallout 4 Clips for an awesome idea of how I see Raider RP going...

The "over-repair" armor perk is "Fix it Good". White Knight is for slower degradation while equipped and cheaper repair cost.
---
I don't have any of the over-repair perks to judge whether Lucky Break can synergize with them, but I kind of doubt it.
---
Thx
---
I quit until new content releases and the game becomes stable. My biggest issue is the daily crashes but I would probably begrudgingly play through those issues if there was anything fun and interesting to do after the 120 hours I have put into the game. Maxing a build is pointless because I didn’t need a god character to finish the most challenging content. I play a game for fun content and not for min/maxing a build but I could see why players stick with a game for the latter. 
---
Nah, but I’ve accidentally scrapped a bunch of awesome outfits that appeared at the top of the list while trying to scrap beer bottles
---
I had 1 do it to me, fuck that was some annoying shit to deal with. Can't imagine 3 all at once. Yes the game is fucking broken, can't wait to get my platinum and be done with this mess. 
---
HAHAHAHAHAAH IT IS SO FUCKING TRUE AND THAT IS WHY I QUIT. They took every fun bug out and left the broken shit pile, while now directly nerfing player damage LOL. The final boss is quitting the shit game and investing your time elsewhere. 
---
Oh come on how does that get downvoted 
---
Every time I see a diner arm grabby thingy i give it a shot
---
Looks like a robot
---
Are you on PS4?
---
tbh that looks awesome.
---
gotta go try this w my suit.
---
Can you point me at where I'd search for secret passage?
---
No worries. I realize now that I should have been more descriptive haha.
---
What does the 'Level' indicate on such a card? I'm level 6 but it keeps showing level 1 like yours
---
Uhh you must not have any core perks? I never even think about the cores I'm using.. I just use em.
---
Maybe certain armor uses more. 
---
it's not a bug because it aids players - it's AN EXPLOIT. Because they coded poorly, and we benefitted from it so we are in the wrong. 
---
Np :) I curious enough that I *had* to check.
---
Not everyone wants to organize a trade or has the caps to be buying them. Caps are almost as hard to come by as screws haha. 
---
How much do you sell, say, 100 for?
---
Stealth sniper uses wood armor pieces. 
---
I did that with an alt that I kept under level 5 for a while and then harassed players at their camps.   Since I was under level 5 they couldn’t kill me when I stayed sleeping in their beds 
---
Can we get an actual guy version?
---
The robots there are aggressive because it is (presumably) the main processing hub of MODUS, and with their systems having been damaged during the internal conflict with the original members of the Enclave, they're definitely on guard.
---
The caved-in mess you saw before was probably a different Robotics area or one of the other destroyed wings of the bunker.
---
If it helps I built my CAMP near the monorail in the south east of the map and there's a fissure site nearby. I usually come back to find at least one spamming my walls, sometimes two and on a rare occasion three. I kill them because it's no big deal to me even 3 at once. I try to do my part to keep Apple Chia screeeeeeee free.

Don't  e a silly bugger like me and forget to loot taggerty.  I tagged the dish git the updated way point and ran to elevator.  Which promptly game me  way point underground once it hit surface.  &gt;. &lt;

Belly button? 😜

Gawd damn I’ve done that too. Scrapped my shielded enclave under armor.

the wierdest thing happened last week..i was outside of the resort and   my TS Dragon was sitting in a paperbag..i did not even access my weapons menu in my pipboy..the game was running a little bit funny..but if i did not walk in that direction my TS Dragon would have just disappeared from my inventory and i would have know clue WTF happened
---
I'm on hiatus, waiting for the next update or maybe new content.
---
THIS IS IMPORTANT - So you can communicate with Bethesda most accurately -  
---
BUGS are things that hinder your experience. Dont bother posting those because they will never be fixed, only aggravated.  
---
EXPLOITS are things that help your experience. Don't bother posting those, because they help you and they will be removed in an instant, and might even come with a nerf.  
---
TL:DR - Don't report anything because the Dev team is a world class joke. 
---
Did you mean one of the benches in the shed in the prison yard?
---
It's like whoever designed them never fought one in game and has no idea the time and valuable resources it uses up, All for a high chance of mediocre loot 
---
True about the card packs. In theory its nice to get "free" cards, but I think maybe 1 or 2 times they have actually been cards that I wanted or could boost something I had already. Mostly you just have a mess of useless/duplicate cards you get to look at forever and ever.
---
How much programming have you done in your life?
---
Wait, it really can work? 
---
"Lately"
---
It's been a while since I played ESO but iirc, there is a page in the shop that literally just says upcoming items. Available X date
---
My friends all quit after the last patch lol. I'm mostly done, too. The nerf ruined what little fun was left in the game. They should have enhanced weapons rather than gimp them. After we all spent hundreds of hours grinding for TSEs, now they are worthless. I kind of hope Bethesda goes bellyup and bankrupt at this point.

I think it's funny - that unintentional coding on the developers side is considered an "exploit". What do you call charging people $60 to beta test for the next half year? A bug? You guys try so hard to reframe, but we see through you.

A suggestion I made a while back. 
---
Only reason people are coming to the game right now is they can get it for 15 bucks in some places.
---
Are challenges based on characters and not accounts?
---
We had 5 spawn on us at the fissure, without it being nuked.   Good times...
---
Shitty, now that they nerfed it.
---
I'm opposite. I'm a vault tec guy. I eat it up but my buddy is a NC and he feels the same way. Lack of good NC content
---
Happened to me also but I found that even when it said lvl 3, I couldn't unlock a lvl 3 lock. I had to actually equip the third card and have it say lvl 4 to get through the lvl 3 lock.
---
Wouldn't be a problem if you could split cards you had previously stacked. It's just bad design that requires this sloppy solution.
---
Yep, small panic attack I usually ensues until it's back in my inventory.
---
I have lots because of adhesive shortages. Need the water and the plants for vegetable starch as well as my permanently thirsty butt. Speed Demon was bad enough on its own but with the radworm bug and the seemingly random high thirst drain in general I went from 54 purified water to 20 in an hour of play  :/  I'll eventually, perhaps, get a second character running and see if the same size base has issues. I won't build until I'm 50 for him.
---
PSN Kl3v3rMonk3y we launch them all the time we will take you. I'll be on in about an hour and that really goes for anyone who needs help.
---
Thank you!! Are you on PS4?
---
All the assets of the game, nearly half the entire cost of a game was already developed... They probably made this game real cheap. But yeah they may have still lost some money. Maybe...
---
no you will NOT nerf, bethesda. you created the nice perk, KEEP IT!  
---
you're supposed to weaken the bad stuff, strengthen the good.
---
That bug has been around since launch.  They are still working on a solution for it.
---
I’ve found going into a cave, or other sturdy solid building and crouching for like 10 min is the only way I can lose them. You can’t hide from them under tree cover or “flimsier” structures. 
---
Seconded. I ran a public roadside workshop camp  but eventually got tired of rebuilding it each and every time I had to move due to the silly "can't have a camp closer than 5x camp-lengths away" nonsense
---
Yeah..
---
Psn: Silune
---
No. Scorchbeasts are the coolest looking creatures in the game. Giant   mutated bats fucking rule, and I want to see versions of the Scorchbeast in all future Fallout games. 
---
But they should improve their AI and the attacks, so they're way more fun to engage and not just an armor breaking annoyance. 
---
Already tried and worked.
---
Attacking him with what?
---
You’re exactly the type of person he’s taking about in this post. Go play something’s else instead of complaining.
---
i use melee. poor aiming so, i try to shoot one, so i get a hit, then let robots and mutants kill them then harvest after it dies.
---
Ty!
---
So this happens to me all the time! I think I figured out what causes it but how to fix it. The issue is fast crouching which I do instead of waving to other players. Best why to fix it is to fast crouch alot then stay crouched and walk. It will normally fix it. 
---
If that doesn't then sometimes relogging helps. 
---
Yes, whenever someone joins the channel it alerts you
---
No offense OP I get what you are saying but sound really whiny and condescending in this post. If you want people to stop complaining about the game and creating a toxic environment, I don’t think a post like this is the answer. People know that they can play another game and lots of us are, but you can’t be angry at people for expressing their complaints and concerns with the game considering it had an abysmal launch, and continues to exist in an almost unplayable state for tons of players.
---
Aside from the issues that I’ve experienced personally (around 500 hours of playtime) Some of the things I have read in this sub that others have experienced was truly jaw dropping. Just when I thought it couldn’t get crazier / worse, it did. I get that some people are just shit posting the game on this sub and refuse to find a silver lining, but to be fair on the contrary there are lots of people who are giving the game and Bethesda waaaay too many passes, no matter how bad it gets. There are lots of people in this sub that will downvote anything negative someone says about the game no matter how they word it and that’s not right. I don’t get how people in this sub can turn around and point the finger at other users as if they are complaining and making up non issues. This isint the first post I’ve seen trying to throw the blame on users as if their concerns aren’t legitimate. Just because YOU are having fun with the game and YOU haven’t experienced ten separate bugs that made your game unplayable doesn’t mean others are having the same experience. There’s not a secret team of redditors in this sub trying to bring down the game, people are complaining for legitimate reasons, stop telling them they shouldn’t when they should. 
---
This game was #10 in sales for 2018 and is now $20.  Most players havent gone halfway into the main quest, so they are likely casuals exploring the huge world.  This game is not dying, despite the online echo chamber, and it probably won't if Bethesda keeps polishing it through patches.
---
Try walking away and then coming back, I've played with some people who have had this happen to them. I think sometimes the server your on can take a bit to spawn items. I've personally never run into this problem unless I'm at white springs with a lot of players
---
This and every single inventory item in the game. With a sortable naming convention you could actually find food/aid items you are looking for, or be able to see all your armor loadout at once. As-is basically everything is an O(n) search because you pretty much have to scroll the whole list.
---
that same thing happened to me
---
i left the area
---
Hey Guys im a huge supporter of BGS but the caps situation is Really Bad.
---
Nerfing Cap stashes so they now are containers and you have to use the extra search option,
---
putting cap prices for vendors obsurdly high.
---
having a 25k caps limit which is useless now as it takes a few days just to get up a few thousand caps and then you spend it all on one item like calibrated shocks or handmade plans.
---
Bgs please change it we need to be able to collect and spend caps like its a real currency not like it feels atm which is like there is only 1,000,000 caps in the worlds pool and every person that plays has to fight to get as many caps as they can.
---
I will be jumping back on today building my Concrete Cave base and ill see you all out there :) 
---
Thats plain stupid. Im not asking for 0 rads, but for buffed protection. 
---
yeah....I just lost every round I had for one gun....not really happy about it but yeah
---
I need to see throwing molotovs against a wooden structure and having it all catch fire
---
I've found if you wait for the body to switch to meat pile, the pile will always appear on an accessible surface. Just wait a bit longer.
---
I wouldn’t necessarily call it an issue 
---
It wouldn’t be as bad if the bots weren’t so fucking sensitive I’ve just scratched ones paint and all of them are after me
---
Look on the bright side, you got a can of stew.
---
Screws, springs and aluminum.  That's what it gave us in Fallout 4. I was furious when I saw that only gave steel, wood, and maybe rubber.

Scrapper perk is horrendous in this game, and it's insult to injury, considering the importance of crafting in this game.

Rocket Turrets... not a joke... they just blow stuff up that comes into the CAMP.  I would add, where we hide our CAMP plays as much into the defensibility of it as the things we choose to defend it... Put my CAMP on a nice little cliff ledge, small shack on concrete foundations on the edge, two missile turrets facing back toward the cliff face (since nothing is going to come from below, nothing comes from above (but missile fodder), which leaves the left and right flanks.. narrowed no less... which rocket turrets shred everything.  It's hidden from view below, a bit of a thing to get to, but works like a dream... turrets are useless everywhere... an axe or sledge hammer from behind renders them dead quickly.
---
yea haven't touched the game since the month it came out, I'm level 9, made it to level 70 on RDRO and am just playing on GTA V. 
---
Slowly but surely the game will come around. I think lol
---
I had that happen with all my 10mm ammo once.  Fortunately 10mm and .45 are pretty common overall and cheap to craft.
---
ok yeah this is better  didnt think of that
---
Yup, been there forever. That's the room behind the glass where you "meet" MODUS
---
My kids bought me some for my birthday, but I have just earned mine.  I usually let them pick what I buy because most of the stuff on there is bullshit.
---
Some are... like "turn level 50" for example.... not sure about all.
---
I would love a small CAMP that it could use as a shop once player vending machines come out.
---
Great event and rewards. Been broken since day one. Its sad because it was such a great event that everyone on the server benefits. 0lus that canned stew is great to up your XP gain. 
---
I concur. In addition most times when I’m nearly done killing them, they Fuck’n leave. 
---
Stim - Rad-X - Rad-Away - Glowing Blood - Boiled Water - Disease Cure all on my quick wheel.
---
Makes it easy to adjust to any situation. Now if they would only allow me to remap every key. I could have them in a more convenient location other than = - 0 9 8 7 (respectively).
---
I already got it thanks anyways though ♥️
---
Scorchbeast are beautiful creatures art wise but annoying with their constant sonic attacks. 
---
I got the BoS soldier suit plans from going through the trainyard boxcars and containers east if Watoga. I got the HC Arms and Legs plans from vendors at Watoga and Harpers Ferry. They did not show up regularly at the vendors so try server hoping.
---
Damn. I usually show up and start nailing her with the DB shotgun and have always gotten rewards. This encounter was super glitchy though, she wasn't animating and she constantly glitched to different parts of the area. Never mind. There's always more. Thanks for the info
---
I don't think we have understood each other. I ment that there might be a lot of people that bought atom points.
---
You realize bringing one down vs all the rest up is essentially the same thing, right?
---
My biggest complaint at the moment is honestly that it feels like there is no way to earn caps. Aside from the vendors with their bullshit limits.
---
Yep, I sure did. Bought the 4,000 Atoms, get 1,000 Atoms free pack. Think it was $20? I love home building and needed the extra Atoms quickly to get the Christmas lights and Snowman bundle.
---
Now I'm super bored and barely playing. I log on once a day to do a round of killing at White Springs, then craft Union uniforms and Civil War dresses, then make the round of vendors. I just want to get to 25K caps in my pool or the Flamingo plan, whichever comes first, then I'm done until there's a major content update.
---
Frankly, I may not last another seven days, regardless of caps or flamingos. 
---
Alright man, you wanna play this game? Fuck it. I got time.
---
First of all, it was a joke. If you don't understand that and it really hurts your feelings that much, I can't help you.
---
You wanna talk about toxic? How about you came at me first which this gem.
---
&gt;in the real world and not in your imagined herd mentality one
---
Then you called me a weirdo, so please explain how none of that is toxic behavior.
---
You're also trying to retcon your own words to make what I said sound more ridiculous. You said, "**they just buffed fireproof, not nerfed it**". Which implies that I said they nerfed fireproof, which I then pointed out I had not. So then you hit me back with this.
---
&gt;And now you are saying nobody was suggesting they would nerf fireproof?
---
No, that's not what I said. I said nobody said they *did* nerf it, because you felt the need to correct something that, again, nobody said.
---
The reading comprehension line was a joke to show you how much of a jerk you were being in your reply, but seriously. 
---
I would also suggest looking up toxic and cynical in a thesaurus. Your arguments may be taken more seriously if you don't repeat the same word over and over.
---
Worried that their son was too optimistic, the parents of a little boy took him to BGS. In an attempt to dampen the boy’s spirits, BGS showed him into a room piled high with nothing but horse manure. Instead of displaying distaste, the little boy clambered to the top of the pile and began digging.
---
“What are you doing?” BGS asked.
---
“With all this manure,” the little boy replied, beaming, “there must be a pony in here somewhere.”
---
What platform are you on, I'm on PC. I can help you out.
---
Sounds intriguing. I have a few questions. Do you use VATS a lot on your build? After freeing up those dmg perks did you move points out of PER and does vats feel less accurate? 
---
I’ve waited for one to land, shot it twice directly in the face with a missile launcher, and it did diddly squat. I actually ended up killing it using a low level combat rifle. So, yeah - my advice? Just keep chucking random crap at it until you find something that works for that particular day. 
---
I mean, what other reason is there to play video games?
---
Their world building has always been excellent, and is the one area where 76 stand shoulder-to-shoulder with 3, New Vegas, and 4.
---
It is faster to level up. You get more XP per kill. Just be creative. Set landmines and snipe them from a distance. Scorched are easy to kill and give just as much XP at those levels
---
I had one of those fights recently. 
---
The client (software on my computer) was having double syncing with the server, indicating I was hitting, but the server subsequently rejecting whatever “reality” my computer was sending up to it, probably because bad comma means it was arriving too late. 
---
So dealing looking like I hit, none of it ended up happening. 
---
Nope, literally inside the prison, trying to remember from memory but you literally go in and through the first door in front of you then turn right to where you have a few cells on your left with crafting stations, the first has a cooking station and the next cell has a tinkerer bench, weapon bench and armor bench. The armor bench has an armor plan in the middle towards the back of the bench but it gets kinda melded in so unless someone has already collected it all you will see is the tabs that stick out from the plan.. I hope that makes sense
---
I’ve been running that way for a looong while as I quickly noticed the inefficiencies.  
---
My must have at 3 star are enforcer
---
And tank buster for ranged and incisor + martial arts for melee. 
---
Plus action boy/girl and bloody mess for either build. 
---
( I don’t have a dedicated heavy build so I didn’t list that ) 
---
If it's a quest area try server hopping.  First in cell typically sets the level of spawn so it tends to reset it.  
---
&gt; On the note of the armour piercing, what it does is that it breaks down the armours durability, with the nerf of white knight card, a sentinel set needs to be repaired a lot and with perks that increase armour penetration, depending on the armour, sometimes it doesn't last as long.
---
Why would you say % armor reduction would cause their armor to degrade faster? One of the issues with people doing the bobblehead exploit was one shotting players in PA and instantly breaking all the pieces since PA specifically calculated incoming damage into durability deterioration while regular armor didn't have the same problem since it didn't factor in damage like PA did. So unless there's some unique interaction with armor penetration I don't know about I don't see how it would factor in with non-PA durability. 
---
I don't even spend the free ones I get.
---
I think I have over 4000 atoms. There is absolutely nothing on there that I would want to buy.
---
Then again I am an old-school gamer and played my entire life without games having pay-to-win shops. If you don't think that's where it's heading you are sorely mistaken.
---
no, they "fixed" the part where everyone on the server got the stew. Now only the people who participate in the event do.
---
I accidentally scrapped my lovingly over-repaired, Level 50 T-60 Torso with Motivated Servos (of course) &amp; Custom Paint after doing Uranium Fever. Didn't fully notice until WELL after I had gone down to the kill SBQ and farm nuke flora in the Bog. Was wandering around, thinking... "why am I taking so many rads... why am I taking more damage from mobs than usual. Hopped out to craft something, looked at the empty spot in my frame.  D'OH!!!!!   
---
I am sure they are trying to think what they can mess up next. Sorry, I mean „fix“ next. My guess is melee since there might still be a bit of fun left playing that build. 
---
There's a mod that sorts them
---
Its the reason why I play. My son just started the Hitman series and was really frustrated because it was such a different play style to the games he had played previously. Just Cause and Borderlands. Once he leaned the mechanics and to slow down he started having a lot of fun. He is now looking forward to playing the entire series.
---
More tedious tho than the natural leveling is what I'm try it to say .
---
People can still slap damage you to death when you're in pacifist mode. It's happening far less now that explosives have been nerfed.
---
I bought Atoms to get the Christmas bundle. I had already blown my earned Atoms on the camp fireplace, two unique doors, succulents and some other camp stuff. 
---
Dear Bethesda,
---
My general feedback is server related. I am having delays from time to time. Hitting things don't count some times and loot takes a lot of time to even show up. Please if work on your servers. I think less delay would make the game much more enjoyble
---
this happened to a guy during the beta.
---
The timer for the end of session was counting down from 1 minute and they guy was where you were in clarksburg and 6 or more behemoths spawned and chased him for the rest of the time haha. he said i bet its a dirty dev trolling me before the server shuts down hahaha good laugh.
---
Yea that's what I thought, good and bad in a way .
---
I've pitched this before but I think ditching the duplicates completely is the real solution. I.e. If you have a card you should be able to just fill up the stars on it with special points, and remove them just as easily.
---
If Bethesda really feels the need to keep things level-locked, that could still be done. Like maybe you can only unlock one star on a new card, then next time you level up you unlock another star. This would have a minor side-effect that players would get more unique cards sooner, but again if Bethesda felt that was a huge balance issue they could just reduce the number of new card choices or push them out a level or too and I think it would even out. 
---
Really any version of this system at all is going to be a huge improvement over the mess of extra cards now and having card rank-ups that we can't revert.
---
Same here. I'm trying a fresh install of the game, I'll let you know.
---
Furious Explosive is still really good too outside of very slow firing or single shot capacity weapons.
---
At west tek. They had TSE turrets. And it was taking alot of my health. And I had PA on. 
---
There is never ever one single place that will give you an amazing amount of any resource. 
---
That’s not the way the game is designed. There are spots you can find a lot of a few resources. Because part of the design concept is you have to salvage.
---
I use vats alot with my ts lever action and have noticed very little difference. The vats bug has put a little damper in it but I manage to work thru it. I was able to move 2 points from PER to AGL to help with armor stats. Either way... I almost feel more balanced and am still playing around with it to find the perfect build. 
---
You seem to be hiding behind the future tense of your statement. 
---
The future tense of your statement is **exactly** what makes it toxic. 
---
Saying you murdered someone when you actually mustered someone is one thing. 
---
Saying you will murder someone “as a joke” and have a herd of people jump in on it, is judging you (me and my 500 groupies) for something you did not do. 
---
As someone who isn’t you, isn’t your groupie and isn’t Bethesda, It’s just not pleasant to read. It’s the modern incarnation bunch of peasants with pitchforks running around looking for a witch to burn. 
---
I don’t understand people complaining about being ripped off...? Bugs or not, I’ve sunk many hours in this multiplayer experiment and I’ve enjoyed all of it. The game is absolutely worth it’s price. 
---
Life and money have risks. You and I both risked money on this game. I feel it paid off, you do not. Unfortunately when you take a risk, you can not expect a refund.
---
It rolled out with the last update. Unless you’re on a server with a lot of people doing it, it doesn’t appear often, if at all. 
---
People blow money on weird crap all the time. For example, I've never bought a lottery ticket or beer in my already quite long life, but I bought Atoms to get the Christmas bundle. 
---
It made me happy to have lights and a snowman in my camp.
---
Yeah but it’s a very very low chance it will 
---
On other servers?
---
The thing is a raider is by definition a griefer.  They will almost certainly be viewed as a prick as anyone that wants to experience that probably quit in first week.
---
RNGods can be cruel.
---
I finally had an instigating lever gun drop for me at level 125........level 35......wtf?
---
It's still better than a non legendary level 45 though. 
---
This is how I finally got mine today!
---
I’ve have tried every machine I’ve come across in the Fallout games, and this is the first time I’ve ever been successful.
---
Missiles 2 lbs
---
Mini nukes 6 lbs.
---
Plasma core 1lb
---
Always check your ammo dump or give away anything you don't use or plan to sell.
---
So 13 per. Nice I might try it out.
---
But it would be awesome if we found out that they're discreetly changing the world, like if the story was progressing, you know? Giving us things to find without telling us. Of course, haters would always find something to complain... =]
---
i'm curious too.  currently looking to drop some of my perk cards down in rank (by burning spare points of course)
---
Well for xbox we don’t even get to have hot keys we have to hit the quick wheel and still scroll to
---
Select
---
3 spawn in the defend the BoS base mission 
---
Yes, for players that don’t want this nonsense there should be separate and equally-attended-to servers and gameplay.
---
No adrenol mutation or bloodied weapon? My carry weights have been up and down but not my gun
---
Contrats!
---
 Tempted to drop a machine in my base to have more chances myself.
---
hahah yeah I posted a few days ago about getting a 3 star bloodied legendary and it ended up being a pipe  :( I won't lie ...im running around cracking skulls with a pipe atm !
---
Thanks guys sorry for the late response for some reason I never got notifications on my post 
---
I used to live there as well, it's a pretty popular spot with some cool features, aside from the acid node and water supply. (Little hollowed out area if you want to camp outside, the relaxing stream/waterfall, etc)
---
Yeah sure PM for my gamertag
---
Im using shotgun melee and rifle. I moved some stuff around and downgraded to lvl. 1 cards. Not much difference honestly. I have my AP, armor and carry weight stuff maxed out and 1 to 3 extra points for other perks i dont normally use or switch out. 
---
Just let 76 die and make es6 work
---
I don't. If I wanted to spend my free time having people take shit from me that I worked hours to acquire, I'd just do my taxes
---
i love Nuka Nades, since they are cheapish to make, and they provide a large explosion
---
I now that feeling. I just got a 2* bloodied Mr. Handy buzzsaw. It's surprisingly good.
---
I was talking with my friend about this a while ago. Maybe it could be unlocked through another upgrade to the travel agent perk card. Either way this would be super helpful. 
---
So brutal. I haven’t scrapped a piece of power armor yet but it’s certainly too easy to do so the way the system works. Sorry for your loss!
---
When I freed up 12 points doing this... I felt like a new game almost. More perks on a smaller percentage still gives you more perks.
---
I was able to have mine changed by Bethesda Support.   
---
I had not realized our account name was going to be our screen name, so my name was essentially my IRL name. They asked me to supply some alternates, and changed it to what was shockingly, the easiest one to remember. Took maybe 1/2 a day. This of course changes your Bethesda account name, but I didn't even have to relog in on the Launcher. It was pretty transparent. Wish I had done it sooner. It also auto-updates your friends list so that your friends see your new screen name in their list. Some of mine didn't even realize I had changed, and found me pretty quickly anyway. (or they are my NSA case workers, and I never had a chance of escaping... ;) )
---
prime rush says it all.
---
inventory might show you are wearing both PA and HMS but it only equips one at a time so if you get into 
---
PA with HMS on it will cancel out the HMS.  Also Rad x doesnt stack anymore so its a never ending spam fest for rad x.
---
Downvoted BECAUSE THEY JUST DONT FUCKING LAND! AAAARGH!!
---
sorry, no room in our inventories. it weighs too much
---
F4 had the various PA upgrades like lead lined, those (as paint?) Could make a return as well
---
So it can survive a nuke since the block are indestructible but if you are in it when a nuke hit do you die? 
---
Thats just wrong. They should straight up just scrap that event now. 
---
Or better, just allow foundations to stack normally. Seems I recall they could in fo4, at least the concrete base ones.
---
Radworms is the best epidemic we never asked for 
---
They look cool but I took over Poseidon and repaired one... the damage they do is worse than a joke. I watched one fire point blank at a level 3 ghoul repeatedly and barely do any damage. It looked like they did about the same damage as 1 bullet of a regular turret.
---
Took me forever to find it here, but yes. If you are talking about when another enemy/player/turret/etc is damaging  an enemy you are currently damaging and your bullets do basically 0 damage because their health goes down and then heals back up about 75% of the damage you just dealt. You then have to waste so much more ammo on the enemy to kill them. Ive had this problem on both my handmade and combat rifles. It is really a giant mood killer and makes me even sometimes give up on trying to kill the enemy because its a waste of time and resources for me. 
---
They used to be decent, but with the nerf, the requirements just arent that worth it
---
Oh damn it. I see that all over the place in pictures but I didn't realize it was limited offer.
---
Whenever we leave groundhog day and the in game calendar moves past the same 2-3 days
---
I'd be really curios what the numbers are on the pvp worlds.  Traditionally these pve games that do pvp only zones just end up with mostly empty pvp zones.
---
I believe this would happen 1v1. When the gang gets back together it would be different.
---
Big one for me, don't server hop when you're confronted for being a raider.
---
I don't play in Pacifist mode and I like to claim workshops for the plans... so I understand that PvP is something that can happen and I'm okay with that. 
---
When someone griefs my base, or steals my junk when I'm re spawning from a fight that didn't involve them killing me (thanks to dying to a mob, my own TSE, or a glitch that suddenly drops my HP to 10% in the middle of the road for no apparent reason), its a real kick in the dick when they just server hop and block to avoid any retribution.
---
If you want to play a raider in a game that was NOT designed very well to support the mechanic, the least anyone could do is ACTUALLY ROLE-PLAY A RAIDER and not use a god like power to avoid retribution. Otherwise all you are is a griefer.
---
I also agree with Dixie-Chink, that you aren't much of a raider if you are running around in suped up X-01/ Ultracite Power Armor. Fallout 76 may have made power armor a universally available thing, but historically in the franchise these aren't things Raiders ever had access to outside of their cobbled together versions, and true Power Armor was limited to Enclave and Brotherhood bc it required specific training.
---
Sent you a message with mine. Just send me a message on Xbox when you're ready, I'm basically always on lol
---
I think that is exactly what most people did. I also stopped playing but I’m still watching this sub. Only to see getting it worse. This week is the exception though since no patch has been applied. Sad, but true.
---
To be honest I’m waiting for anthem. Hoping BW knows what they are doing. After that I’ll come back in a couple of months. Maybe the game will then finally meet its succcessfull destruction by Bethesda. Maybe not. For some reason I’m still hoping it will turn around and not become a pay2win free 2 play game.
---
Junk
---
Will hit up support, but hope char names will become a thing. 
---
You can see it in this video, starts at 12:00: [https://youtu.be/EnehCLX-csk?t=725](https://youtu.be/EnehCLX-csk?t=725) In the corridor where you find a locked metal door (with a keypad), there's a very narrow entrance to a passage. In this passage, you'll find some vines to the left. It looks like a wall, but you can go through it. There you'll find the "thing". \^\_\^ 
---
I sell almost everyday just msg me GT: rcayton1
---
Not that I don't believe you, but post proof if you want any traction here. 
---
Yep, at this point it's been long enough I'd expect a good chunk to have shelved it until dlc drops.
---
Thank you for your service.
---
A lot of these are great ideas. What I'd really like to see is being able to harvest all crops at a push of the button. You can go over to you C.A.M.P. machine to press Y to repair all on the XBox they could add one more button to harvest all crops. It's very tedious to have to go to each individually and pick, especially for a player like me who enjoys having a large garden. And, like may are saying, let us have more variety. If you've picked it, you should be able to grow it. They can even make a game of it, pick a hundred and it opens up for you, something like that. 
---
Cool. Thanks again!
---
Oof, when I did the mission through the armory someone had recently also done it, so it was cleared out. Then my game disconnected just as I was on the last leg of it (because my internet cut out, that’s the reason usually now for me), and when I logged back on it was full of turrets.
---
No, but I sold my second best weapon at the time thanks to server lag. Lag made me think the game didn't register my click, so I clicked again and then the server caught up and sold the item I was trying to sell, plus my gauss rifle right below it. 
---
Wait... We can do that‽
---
The dragon is a quad barrel 
---
I dunno if they have to ditch survival, keep it there for players who want PVEVP.  But the only content that really matters is PVE.  If they can balance PVP and make it not awful, that'd be fine, but I doubt PVE players are going to cave and start engaging in PVP when it's the only thing left to do, even if they balance it perfectly.  They'll probably just play something else, and come back when new events or PVE content is announced.
---
This is kinda why I've been taking my time with the quests.  I still haven't done them all, I haven't even seen every area on the map.  Trying to make it last as long as I can, and having a decent enough time by not blazing through it.  But I'll eventually run out of stuff to do, and I'm not going to start hopping onto survival servers because I just have no interest in them.
---
It makes sense because you’re paying for an actual service,  a carriage, a boat, or a silt strider.  As it is now you’re just losing resources to an invisible “service”.
---
As a matter of fact I did put down Fallout 76, one week after I bought it, two months ago. I doubt I will be coming back anytime soon because the game is still a big shit show. For the last month I have been off work and spent plenty of time playing other games. Even random, third party ones thanks to sharing a Steam library with a friend and each game has been more put together than Fallout 76. 
---
You have to remember that they produced a product unlike anything any of their studios or affiliated studios have produced. Fallout 76 is vastly different than Fallout 4 and even incomparable to Elder Scrolls Online, which of course is the only multiplayer remotely related to Bethesda and its affiliates. You cannot blame people for not enjoying the content of a game from a studio they love with the lore of a game series they grew up playing. 
---
u need to find an are within your comfort zone. I, personally dont mind taking on higher levels..it adds to the challenge and the xp is generous..obviously not a place where u will be defeated easily but maybe somewhere u can take someone out one by one..for earlier levels i always suggest summersville because it only takes about 10 mins to clear the area..the mutants drop good loot..and then just server hop
---
Its just a theory, but good luck.
---
To help reinforce this, I visited Watoga and Harpers Ferry last night, they both were selling "Sturdy Combat Armor" plans (legs and arms respectively), but not "Heavy Combat Armor" plans of any kind... but I purchased "Heavy Armor Chest" at Harpers Ferry a few days ago.
---
I hope Im right, and the BOS armors are still on the RNG tables for Grafton. Otherwise its going to be a real pain to get them. 
---
That's your opinion, here in the UK if something doesn't work as advertised or isn't fit for purpose then yes you most definitely should get a refund.
---
I was using a bloodied axe. Does it effect anything?
---
Watch for two things, can you reload it and do you have a non zero ammo counter.
---
That said pistols and energy are booth poop, so isn't very useful regardless.
---
Both times this has happened to me, they honestly had already done massive damage before I could relog.
---
I'd agree if it took significant resources and time to kill them like SBQ but if it's Whitespring ghouls  then meh. 
---
I've heard you can, though I've never seen one. I'd love a quad Dragon.
---
They need seperate servers for low levels only. Like till level 20
---
Yep pressed t and r at the same time accidentally, a d dropped my mutant slayers explosive shotgun (this is before any major dupes and they were about 25k caps each)
---
Okay, sooo where is the news in your point? I mean it has been said already a gazillion times that Bethesda fucked up. Bad. 
---
I'll be happy to send screen shots but, I am new to this, how do I add them on here?
---
Can’t unfortunately 
---
I've accidentally sold my primary weapon before. Had to buy it back for way more caps.  Inflation and all that...
---
Check your stored items/blueprints, especially if you've ever had your camp spot taken when you log in. It tends to store a complete copy of the camp every time that happens. I've had upwards of 250% camp budget used because of that.
---
Budget does not increase with level btw.
---
Its always felt abit empty honestly.
---
I can't help but to compare FO76 to Conan Exiles. In CE, I feel like I can build huge castles. I can make whole towns with shops that have dedicated work stations for different kinds of crafting. I can have NPCs that stand around and make the place feel more alive. There's a lot more to the game than that, but that's immensely satisfying for me. I just don't see that kind of "I'll commit time and resources to this, and I'll make something great in the end" element in the FO76 canvas.
---
Try going to imgur.com and uploading the images there. Then post that link in an edited version of your post. 
---
BOS plans are at Grafton, both responder bots have the chance to have them. So you get a double shot with each server hop.
---
Sturdy and Heavy Combat armor plans are found in Watoga and Harper's Ferry though its also RNG with each server.
---
Sadly both of these types of plans still seem to be part of the RNG populated plans rather than always being available.
---
That’s fair and you’re correct. Those rules apply here as well. Again it’s a matter of perspective. Some fans heard Bethesda advertise their product as flawless, polished, and finished, whereas I remember them advertising the game as an experiment, a different experience, and expected players to break the game share feedback and build upon the original foundation to create the finished product. It would be difficult to argue that Bethesda didn’t deliver what they promised. 
---
They were the first games that popped in my head, and it doesn't do a thing to change the point
---
I woke my kid up when I picked up mine 
---
Absolutely, so this is exaggerated, but lets say at full health your axe does 100 damage, at 80% health it might do 125 damage, at 50% health it might do 200 damage and so on, bloodied weapons get stronger the less health you have
---
You can get one from a static location In fo76
---
I think people are just shocked still this happened at all with a Fallout title that they are still in the grieving phase.
---
Doughnuts of doom. Love that explanation
---
Oh okay now I remember reading that on the axes description. But it doesnt explain why my carry weight is also doing that.
---
I've been using excavator armor for a while and its never done this before.
---
The whole game has turned in to seeking enough materials to repair my guns and craft ammo so I can go find more materials to craft and repair what i spent getting the materials.
---
Its gotten to the point that I log on out of habit. When the world loads, I look at the map rland remember there's nothing to do and leave. 
---
I’ve always wondered how the hell the time works? I thought they would go up with the servers but they haven’t 
---
That's one line that bugs me. The other is "We want more drama in this game." Don't worry! Ya nailed that one, Beth!
---
I don't think this is Bethesda's fault. XB and PS have some legal requirements that gamertags be displayed.
---
Pretty sure it's always the max level of the enemy which dropped it? (Bounded by the item)
---
Moot point.
---
Nope. Because it is a full price game. If it would have been free to play from the start it might have been different. I bought some stuff from path of exile for example. To support their work.
---
But in Bethesda’s case it wouldn’t come to my mind. Not with the full price game tag and not with the huge crap they keep delivering as a sorry excuse for a patch.
---
Imho the game would be in much better condition if no patch would have been applied at all.
---
Their patches were so bad a lot of people stopped playing (myself included). And that is the biggest reason why no money should reward that behavior. 
---
Yea my excavator armor has been wonky too as far as carry weights go lol i cant answer that one 
---
Works for eso dont see why not.
---
Unpopular opinion: Heavy Leather gear is actually OP
---
In pvp yeah, but in pve I'd say it can make a difference. 
---
Someone informed me that Adamantium Skeleton can counter stagger, do you know if that's true?
---
Good for clearing weight on your stash since if you have the perk for weigh red on explosives they are only .003 and decent 
---
Fast travel usually fixes it, as well. Even if you fast travel to the location you're already at.
---
You honestly just might have missed the big bend tunnel exit being in a different spot then you expected. 
---
This happened to me when I was Overencumbered and I assumed the spawn would be where I entered (On the Cranberrybog side).
---
I looked for the entrance for a good minute or so before I realized it was in the Ash Heaps side of the map.  
---
Ah, but as we all know, in FO76 the **real** satisfaction comes in winning through RNG!
---
You'll still get staggered 
---
That is the guy version.
---
So true man, once they actually stop circling you and actually stop moving in the air, you can't even aim at them because they are shooting those HUGE sonic projectiles. Only way I can see them while they're pounding me is if I VAT them.
---
Thanks:):) 
---
Ah ok, thank you for answering.
---
 Nerf mentality is what's killing this game IMO. I've given up hope with this train wreck anyway. Plenty of other great games out this year.
---
You can get some of the same "one time" challenge rewards on different accounts sometimes but I'm pretty sure it's bugged, like everything else. 
---
That's a great name for it lol. 
---
The ski village outside of top of the world usually spawns a legendary super mutant warlord, more often than not it has been a 3* for me whenever I go there
---
I went back to finish RDR2 and farming decos in MHW.
---
100% agree
---
nope. It is sad but what killed the game finally for me was not the terribly bad drops of 3stars. It was logging in and seeing the weapons I played the game for like 500h+ being turned to crap. 
---
But all in all I do agree. This should not happen. It’s bad loot design.
---
Updated! LOL
---
The 92 people who voted yes are cancer on the gaming community
---
Nuked Whitesprings is probably your best bet. The AWOL Armaments event always has a 3* Gutsy at the end and the Horde events spawn a legendary boss.
---
The weird thing for me, is this is the sort of complain that is legitimate and significant. 
---
I can't get behind the "boo-hoo my TSE only does 300 damage instead of 1200 damage" bandwagon... but I CAN get behind the "um, I just killed a legendary and got no legendary" band wagon. that is a major issues that hurts the hardcore and casual a like. Not just a QoL issue but a "I don't really want to play this game any longer" issue. 
---
Honestly, same with changing the supply drops to be locked to the player and you know become wanted if you loot one. Really ruined the community notion of ordering them up for lower level players as a solid. And the Feed the people "fix". The "broken" way it was before was a great community orientated outcome that was kind of fun. The game did not get better when that was fixed. Bethesda did not make a value add removing that, quite the opposite. 
---
THESE are the issues and decisions that hurt a game. seems petty maybe, but to me this is a bigger impact than a gun nerf. 
---
Not saying that's a bad idea but I'm not really sure how feasible it is with how the current system works, 0 cost would just be an easy change to make that shouldn't risk breaking anything.
---
why are you returning them?
---
Yeah, it's the nerf mentality and not the fact that the game is just bad.
---
I thought it was just me. I get motion sickness and the sound is like nails on a chalkboard.  
---
By the by, I am *also* a filthy casual who likes scavving lol.
---
hope you pulled up a chair .its gonna be a while 
---
I really hate the scaling of PVP because of the cap loss. There really is no difference between a level 60 and a level 300 player, but the level 300 player is penalized far more for dying in PVP. 
---
Either leveling up should give you at the very least increased damage resistance in PVP, or perhaps the penalty should be exactly the same for all players 50+.
---
... so they fixed People on a server all receiving „stew“ if someone finished the quest 
---
But didn’t bother to actually „fix“ the quest...?
---
Yes either use a friend or a world container. If it's something of high value use a friend. If not I use a dresser near my camp. Just log back into the same server from your recents. Everything will be there (if the servser doesn't crash). There is some risk that way but I have never lost anything. 
---
Every turret can be disabled via terminals throughout the process
---
That shit was free in fallout 4, you paid for recycled content in a half ass game.
---
Thanks, I love and enjoy the game! They just really need to fix bugs and add more PVE content soon and all is great 
---
Mostly that’s because you’re losing the weight of the plastic that is consumed when junk is bulked, though, not because bulk itself weighs less. Only 2 junk types weigh less when bulked, aluminum and copper (I think).
---
La pacifist mode camp ought to only receive slap damage from players too. 
---
Game over man, game over.
---
This is why I uninstalled the game. Anything at high-ish levels and you're just fighting scorchbeasts without end. It's pointless to keep playing when they're basically immortal flying demons that rape you and chase for miles if you run. Can't do a fucking thing. /unistall
---
If it weren't for the trees, I'd ask if you were Matt Damon.
---
I'm sitting right on the border between being too lazy to do that and wanting to do that for science. 
---
I confess, I'm one of the few that have. Usually after payday as a gift to myself just to make it over the hump to use the ones I earned in game to get some random thing, like the Christmas lights or whatnot. Prices are obscene though. If they decreased the prices for things I guarantee I would have splurged more than I already have on Atom content.
---
I’ve been right on the very edge of the circle and thought I was safe. Nope still very dead. 
---
Sadly no one has replied to me, except you.
---
I'm not sure I can give any hints without giving it away entirely, but it isn't the most secretive of things.
---
I just want to climb some of the taller structures in the game and take pictures there.
---
Nothing crazy
---
This looks like a move poster from „the Martian“ with Matt Damon as Mark Watney 
---
I like it :)
---
I hadn't noticed at first because my buddy always grabbed aggro... but the first time I fought one mano y guano it was the absolute worst.
---
After hitting up support, Bethesda changed my name within 48 hours. It's ok to be wrong.
---
Here we beloooong fighting for survival
---
Damn I need some gunpowder, would have gladly taken some lol. 
---
try waiting 2 weeks.....then get back to me 
---
The bobblehead only makes the "sweetspot" larger
---
Thanks, my only regret is that I don't remember where I took it
---
Yes but it grants you -50 carry weight instead of +50 due to an old software version. Will patch it so you get the +50 carry weight but we also made all items 40% heavier for balance
---
Yes, live pony, not in game
---
Not on my play sessions unfortunately. 
---
People keep stealing my junk and stimpaks from my farming locations. They also keep running in front of my house across my lawn waving. I hate that, stay off my lawn!
---
Ha ha mano y guano? Haven't heard that before. Pure gold. Thank you for the snicker :-)
---
I mean whats advertised on the product. On the case / Download details. 
---
It doesn't say anywhere on either of those that this is a suck it and see or an early alpha product, which is in effect, what we got :/
---
The legendary system is far too limiting. I think they'd need more randomized buffs on armor and weapons that you can find. Like you can find guns that aren't legendary but have something like faster reload or slightly higher damage against certain enemies. Something to make items unique from each other, like Borderlands, except without the super broken weapons BL has.  
---
The problem is I don't think the Creation Kit is set up well for that and they're really stingy about taxing the servers with more data to keep track of. They'd have to set up some system where when an item drops it rolls against a pool of "spells" (the game internally uses old terms like spells leftover from when it was used for Oblivion, I've literally seen it say spells in my active effects screen) and stack those on the item as enchantments.  
---
So in other words, the game is pretty much set up to fail as a looter shooter because of the rigidity of the Creation Kit. If you've ever fooled around with modding Elder Scrolls or earlier Fallouts you'd understand all the hoops the modders have to jump through to make the engine do anything interesting. Todd saying they don't need a new engine is absolute nonsense.
---
^this. I get tired of feeling I'm farming for mats for repairs just to need more mats for repairs and needing ammo. I've just feel like I've lost my motivation to move forward because there is no forwards. Its just become a boring treadmill with no rewards.
---
passive increase in HP?
---
Extra END= extra HP
---
Well crap.  Went to take a snapshot and discovered the eat-o-tronic was that dinky wall mount thing and not the pie machine.  That's annoying to have spent caps on.  :(
---
Also ap drain if I I remember correctly 
---
haha brillaint!
---
Bethesda doing there upmost to bat of those returns!
---
Thanks my friend! Visiting there today
---
I love fighting scorchbeasts. They're the apex predator of Appalachia - they should be tough to deal with. I love travelling between each fissure site and taking them out. Shame they don't drop much of use though.
---
Initially I found them to be pretty unstoppable, then I discovered shotguns with the Enforcer perk. Cripple the wings and then blast them in the arse or face when they land. Use nearby mobs or Whitespring robots to draw their attention away from you. They still take ridiculous amounts of ammo to kill though and destroy your armour.
---
Nowadays I kill them in 6 - 10 shots with a lever action and VATS perks such as Better Criticals, 4 Leaf Clover, Critical Savvy, etcetera. Aim for the head. I regular fight three at a time with enough risk to make it interesting but not so much that you end up with no ammo and broken armour. If you also have Adrenaline you can take out the scorched that are usually nearby to stack damage. Stealth attacks obviously make the whole thing much quicker, and Escape Artist is good for reactivating stealth if you're detected. 
---
As others have pointed out, the Fireproof perk is also really useful in defending against their long range attacks.
---
5hp I've read
---
Funny you mention going back to FO4. I miss being able to create settlements without the harsh cap and the unlimited stash. Something to consider!
---
Currently I log in to get some Atoms and sell to vendors. Hoping a future DLC will bring my friends back. Want to be sitting pretty if that ever happens.
---
The logic is faulty 
---
Those that truly have left don’t read this subreddit and thus cannot vote because they are unaware of the existence of the poll 
---
Oh well. The reason my interest is peaked is because I've done some of that haha, my best advice is to use the power armor frames. If there's a ledge too high to jump, place a frame up there instead, then enter the frame. You'll get up there. You can also up off of them too
---
We are not getting another TES while the shitty WoW clone version makes money. Period.
---
I ate mine after showing it to my group. Because nothing is more American than squandering precious things.
---
Err, there is a trailer dude. Plus ESO is not developed by BGS
---
Oh OK then whatever
---
Best of luck to you man. My best advice, build a camp either at the top of the mountain I. The centre of the map like me, or in a monorail hole 
---
Isn't that purely a marine armor plan spawn? I've found three copies of Marine Tactical Helmet there, plus various marine parts &amp; the wetsuit.
---
I did think about purging my friends list. The people I added are hardly ever on. It's a bit disheartening. Anyone on xbox one play exclusively in the evening? I've got work and kids so that's the only time I get to play and the game loses its appeal a bit when playing solo
---
Am I the only one not having issues?
---
When my friend found his, he told me “oh, I have something for you by the way, you’re going to love this!!! ... There!” 
---
“What? Where?”
---
“I dropped it for you”
---
“Steve there’s nothing here”
---
“What no bag?”
---
“Nope”
---
“Aw fuck. It’s glitched through the floor. I got you a pie!”
---
😭
---
The lost pie haunts us to this day.
---
Ah bugger it all :( 
---
That definitely would have made the whole mission much easier!
---
Yeah loadouts, will really appreciate it.
---
You realize that pacifist mode changes NOTHING to the damage you receive? It only affects your damage OUTPUT. I can’t believe that this still isn’t common knowledge three months after launch.
---
Yes: http://dulfy.net/2018/11/22/fallout-76-vendors-locations-and-factions-guide/
---
You need to have it equipped for armor to break slower. If you equip it for repairing then you only get the repair cost buff.
---
Pretty sure those are forcibly 1 in the magazine, so no quad.
---
Done
---
The same has been happening to me, and after some poking around it seems like its caused by fast traveling. I'll fast travel somewhere and lose maybe 15 pounds, or perhaps lose 20 dmg on my current weapon-- sometimes it'll even go up! Got no idea why, but happens every fast travel 
---
Dude. Pacifist mode doesn’t change the dmg you receive. It only affects your output. 
---
Had the same thing happen the other day, think they're was some lag going on with swapping perk cards as it happened after swapping the lockpicking in and out a couple times. 
---
Also was getting green thumb bonus after i had swapped it out for lockpicking
---
Good on ya. Unbelievable on their part man. I hope you get your helmet and it's in perfect condition. 
---
Bloodied builds that use Unyielding especially (or any armor really) benefit from the +1 endurance as it raises your max health (thus less chance of dying when you’re bloodied) &amp; also benefits Ap regen, which they use a lot if also melee
---
Well, if you don’t support it it won’t grow, so there’s your answer.
---
170,800 is closer to 171k than 170k, though... so where's your point?
---
Do we have any other option for a multiplayer post-apocalyptic, open world, FPS looter with quests?
---
The only other game I can think of that ticks those boxes is The Division and I didn’t like it. If we had more options I’d probably stop playing this game.
---
(Xb1) Have the same issue. I had a raider set, x01, excavator and I finished Belly Of The Beast and got ultracite. So decided to drop the raider. But same issue, couldn’t drop it. So I continued to try and drop it in different places for like 15 min. Wouldn’t drop, so I gave up. Went into my Inventory 20 min later, and since I have my x01 painted, it has the atom shop symbol beside it. Except now, I have 2 sets with the atom shop symbols. Bring them all out, and instead of a raider set, I now have 2 sets of x01. I was worried it would fix itself on relogin so decided to keep both until I could figure out which was the real one. But now I can’t put it back into my stash. So I have had it on me since. Couple days/logins later, the damn thing copied my ultracite and now I have 2 of those, one x01 and one excavator. 
---
What an amazing compilation. Thanks for taking time to do this!! I see merit in nearly every single one.
---
of course I realize that. It is common knowledge. Did you realize that unless you hit someone back in PVP, they don't do full damage? And when you're in pacifist mode, you can't hit back to start the full damage.
---
shit reason
---
That was your lvl when you took the picture
---
Yeah, my new alt is level 8 and I usually wave at the higher level players and run away :).
---
That may be, but a reason none the less.
---
you're the best!
---
Ive taken to appearing offline on xb1 and joining my friends servers and then blowing up their bases and then quickly leaving the server so they dont know its me. Its the small things in life.
---
nice touch on the fast travel. I'll have to try that.

The Dragon does more damage than the BP rifle at equal levels, something like +25% IIRC. The BP rifle reloads faster and probably breaks more slowly.
